["MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Minneapolis city attorney has declined to file charges against Minnesota running back Shannon Brooks after an alleged assault.\n\nBrooks was arrested after an Oct. 14 incident in which his male roommate accused him of assault. No injuries were reported.\n\nCity spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie said in a statement that the investigation has been completed and there is insufficient evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBrooks suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He was cleared to play on Oct. 20, but he was suspended for that game following his arrest.\n\nHe returned to the field last Friday, and had 154 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries in the Gophers' 38-31 win over Indiana, before he hobbled off the field with an injury to his right leg.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

NYCFC advanced from the knockout round with a 3-1 win over Philadelphia on Wednesday.\n\nAtlanta was in the race for the Supporters' Shield up to the final day of the regular season, but fell short after losing 4-1 at Toronto. Still, slowing down Atlanta's scoring machine and the duo of Josef Martinez and Miguel Almiron will be a challenging prospect for NYCFC. Martinez won the Golden Boot with a league-record 31 goals, while Almiron had 14 assists and was just as important in making Atlanta's attack so dangerous.\n\nNYCFC got one goal from David Villa in the win over Philadelphia but needs to continue getting contributions from Maxi Moralez and Ismael Tajouri-Shradi, who also scored against the Union.\n\nThe two regular-season matchups between the sides ended in ties. They played a 2-2 draw in Atlanta in April and finished 1-1 at Yankee Stadium in early June.\n\n1. NEW YORK RED BULLS vs. (5) COLUMBUS CREW\n\nThe winners of the Supporter' Shield will face the feel-good story of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Columbus secured its spot in the postseason on the final day of the regular season then ousted D.C. United on penalties in the knockout round thanks to another tremendous performance from goalkeeper Zack Steffen. It's been a special closing stretch to the season for the Crew, making the playoffs and seeming to have their long-term future secured in Columbus with new ownership.\n\nIt's been a special season for the Red Bulls as well, capturing the Supporters' Shield for the third time since 2013. But the previous two times the Red Bulls won Supporters' Shield they failed to make MLS Cup. New York was knocked out in the conference semifinals by Houston in 2013 and beaten by Columbus in the Eastern finals in 2015.\n\nRed Bulls will certainly have an advantage in the first leg despite being on the road after Columbus had to play 120 minutes and go to penalties to advance from the knockout round.\n\nColumbus does have a win this season at Red Bull Arena, beating New York 3-2 in late July. The teams played to a 1-1 draw in Columbus in early June.\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE\n\n1. SEATTLE SOUNDERS vs. (5) PORTLAND TIMBERS\n\nThe Sounders got to rest in the knockout round after wrapping up the regular season with a 2-1 victory over the San Jose Earthquakes. The win, secured on a Raul Ruidiaz stoppage-time goal, combined with Colorado's Decision Day victory over FC Dallas, slid the Sounders into second place in the standings.\n\nThe Sounders won 14 of their final 16 games in another remarkable second-half surge under coach Brian Schmetzer.\n\nPortland lost its final regular-season match against the Whitecaps and had the daunting task of facing FC Dallas on the road in the knockout stage. But the Timbers pulled off a 2-1 upset with a pair of goals from Diego Valeri, despite playing for much of the second half a man down.\n\nThe victory set up the Cascadia semifinal between the two teams, who last met in the 2013 conference finals with Portland winning 5-3 on aggregate.\n\nThe two teams met three times during the regular season, but Seattle won the last one 1-0 at Providence Park.\n\nPortland will be without Larrys Mabiala after he was sent off with a red card in the match against Dallas.\n\n1. SPORTING KANSAS CITY vs. (6) REAL SALT LAKE\n\nReal Salt lake has been the surprise of the playoffs. First the team snuck into the postseason despite being the only league team that didn't play on Decision Day, earning the sixth and final seed by virtue of the LA Galaxy's meltdown at home against the Houston Dash.\n\nThen they stunned LAFC 3-2 in a knockout round match Thursday night in Los Angeles. Jefferson Savarino's shot deflected off Walker Zimmerman's head in the 69th minute for the winning margin. LAFC fans at Banc of California Stadium did not react well, some shouting an offensive slur and throwing items on to the field.\n\nBut RSL will face a much greater challenge in Sporting, which has won three straight and led the Western Conference (and was second in the league) with 65 goals, a club record. Kansas City secured the top seed with a 2-1 Decision Day victory over LAFC.\n\nThe two sides are meeting in the postseason for the first time since their tense 2013 MLS Cup final, which Sporting won on penalties after a 1-1 draw.\n\nThe teams met twice this season in league play, with RSL winning 4-1 at Rio Tinto Stadium in July, and a 1-1 draw in Kansas City in late September.\n\nSporting will be without Seth Sinovic, who was sent off with a red card in the regular-season finale.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Duane Burleson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Wide receiver Tyler Lockett is back to full strength and producing more than ever for the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAnother year removed from the broken leg that ended his 2016 season, Lockett again looks like the explosive threat he was in his first two years in Seattle. Lockett has already matched his career-high in touchdowns in just seven games played this season.\n\n\"He's been a big factor early in the year,\" head coach Pete Carroll said.\n\nHe caught six touchdowns as a rookie in 2015 but had managed just three over the last two seasons combined. He's on pace to set career highs in catches, yards, yards per reception and touchdowns through the first seven games of 2018.\n\n\"He's really at his top speed right now and rolling, which his top speed is pretty fast,\" quarterback Russell Wilson said.\n\nEven though Lockett played in all 16 games for Seattle last year, he never got back to 100 percent. He said he struggled to make it through practices last year.\n\n\"It's hard to get somebody an opportunity who can barely make it through practice,\" Lockett said. \"Even though I was finding ways and still looked like myself and (could) run around in the games, it was just harder to be able to put myself in a position to help the team in an expanded role.\"\n\nBut even though Lockett has caught a touchdown in all but one game for the Seahawks this season, he quickly shot down any notion that it's a significant achievement to him.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Lockett said. \"I just go out there and play and have fun with my teammates and try to make the best out of every opportunity. You never know when you're going to get the ball or the ball is going to be thrown your way.\"\n\nWhile it may not mean anything to Lockett, it has meant a great deal to the team.\n\nWith Doug Baldwin a bit slowed this year due to a pair of knee injuries, Lockett has helped carry the scoring output for Seattle. His six receiving touchdowns are among the best in the NFL. Antonio Brown (8), Tyreek Hill (7) and Eric Ebron (7) are the only players with more receiving touchdowns, though Hill and Ebron have each played one more game than Lockett.\n\n\"He's come through so many challenges,\" Baldwin said. \"That injury he had a couple years ago, that wasn't a little injury. That was a very significant injury when it happened. I was on the field and saw it and it was heartbreaking. ... You don't know how people respond to that. If they have the mental fortitude to come back from something that significant. Tyler has done a miraculous job to say the least.\"\n\nNotes: RB Chris Carson (hip), LB K.J. Wright (knee) and SS Bradley McDougald (knee) are all questionable to play against the Chargers on Sunday. Carroll said Wright and McDougald should be good to go while Carson will be a game-time decision. ... CB Neiko Thorpe (groin) and G Jordan Simmons (calf) are doubtful.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of children now ages 11-22, as well as future generations.\n\nBut while refusing to halt the trial, the justices indicated that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit could do so if the Justice Department asks. That court has refused to intervene in the past.\n\nAssociate Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented, presumably because they were prepared to stop the trial now.\n\nThe justices had expressed misgivings about the lawsuit in July, when they refused to stop the legal process but said the breadth of the claims was \"striking.\" Whether those claims should be handled in court \"presents substantial grounds for difference of opinion,\" the court said then.\n\nLawyers for Our Children's Trust have argued that government policies have deprived the children of their \"constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, to dignity, to personal security, to a stable climate system capable of sustaining human lives and liberties.\"\n\nThey want the government to \"prepare an accounting of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and prepare and implement an enforceable national remedial plan\" for reducing carbon emissions.\n\nFederal district court Judge Ann Aiken, who has presided over pretrial briefing for more than two years, had scheduled the trial to begin Monday and last up to 12 weeks.\n\n\u201cCourts have an obligation not to overstep the bounds of their jurisdiction, but they have an equally important duty to fulfill their role as a check on any unconstitutional actions of the other branches of government,\u201d she said last month in denying the government's effort to stall or dismiss the trial.\n\nThe Justice Department objected to the time and expense, claiming that the issue was one for Congress, not the courts, to resolve. Its objections were first raised during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThis suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process, by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in court papers.\n\nThe children on whose behalf the lawsuit was filed, he said, \"can make no credible claim of imminent, irreparable harm. Their alleged injuries stem from the cumulative effects of CO2 emissions from every source in the world over decades.\u201d\n\nAlthough the case, Juliana v.

An ankle issue forced Justify to retire unbeaten in July, leaving Saturday's marquee Breeders' Cup Classic without the sport's most notable horse.\n\nGoing forward, Game Winner's name is in the mix as the next possible star.\n\nHis third Grade 1 victory comes just over a month since winning the American Pharoah, named for the 2015 Triple Crown winner that Baffert also trained.

Of all the milestones that Philip Rivers has earned, the one he appreciates the most ave to deal with longevity. On Sunday the Chargers QB makes his 200th consecutive start, becoming the fourth quarterback in league history to reach that milestone. (AP Photo/David Richard, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Philip Rivers has many accomplishments, but there is one trait that he has taken pride in over his 15-year career \u2014 durability.\n\nThe Chargers' veteran signal caller will become the fourth quarterback in NFL history to make at least 200 consecutive regular-season starts when Los Angeles travels to Seattle.\n\n\"It's pretty cool. I mean, obviously the two Mannings (Peyton and Eli) and Favre have started over 200 in a row, and I just feel thankful,\" Rivers said. \"I think there is a small element of toughness involved, but then again, shoot, lots of prayers for me from many people on Sundays and guys' protection that allow me to be out there each and every week, whether dealing with minor things or big things.\"\n\nRivers' streak is even more impressive considering the physical and mental demands of the position as well as the constant QB turnover throughout the league. Since Rivers' first start on Sept. 11, 2006, at Oakland:\n\n\u2014 There have been 179 different starting quarterbacks, including San Francisco's Nick Mullens on Thursday night.\n\n\u2014 Of that group, 78 have started for two or more teams and 12 have been with four or more. Ryan Fitzpatrick has been the most traveled with starts for six teams.\n\n\u2014 While the Chargers have had only one starting QB, 18 teams have had 10 or more start under center and eight have had 13 or more with the Browns (18), Rams (16) and Vikings (16) leading the way.\n\n\u2014 Rivers, who has a 111-98 record, has started against 91 quarterbacks and defeated 69, including Favre and both Mannings.\n\nLongevity, though, is nothing new for Rivers, who started 51 consecutive games at North Carolina State.\n\n\"I think just being out there each and every week has always been important,\" he said. \"Obviously, you want to be able to go out there and help. It's not just be out there. You want to play at a high level, and that's been up and down over 199, but being out there means something.\"\n\nNFL on CBS commentator Boomer Esiason said he thought it wasn't humanly possible to see a quarterback start 200 or more consecutive games, but that Rivers' leadership is what has stood out throughout his career.\n\nHe also noted that Rivers' relationship with Drew Brees during his first two years with the Chargers, where both had a friendly rivalry, is something that rarely happens these days due to constant scrutiny and social media.\n\nWhile Brees has had great success with Sean Payton in New Orleans, Rivers has had a tougher time. The Chargers have not been to the playoffs since 2013.\n\n\"With Philip's competitive personality and leadership he is what other quarterbacks should aspire to be,\" Esiason said. \"He's an extension of the coaching staff when he is out on the field.\"\n\nEven at age 36, Rivers is off to one of the best starts of his career as the 5-2 Chargers have won four straight. He is third in the league with a 117.8 passer rating and is tied for third with 17 touchdown passes.\n\nHe has excelled this season on deep passes along with throwing into tight windows. According to the league's Next Gen stats, Rivers leads the league at 9.2 yards per attempt and has a 124.1 rating when the receiver is separated by less than a yard from the defender.\n\nRivers also has six touchdowns and no interceptions on deep passes (thrown in the air 20 yards or more). Seattle's defense has allowed only five completions on deep passes.\n\n\"Sometimes as an older player, your body won't let you do it. He's gifted. He hasn't faced that problem,\" Chargers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt said.\n\nIf Rivers' streak continues, he would tie Peyton Manning (208) at the end of the season and Eli Manning (210) in Week 2 of next season. As for Favre's mark of 297, Rivers said that is too many games for him to have a chance.\n\n\"Favre was always a favorite of mine. Still is. I kind of wanted to have that mark, or at least push for it in college,\" Rivers said. \"I'm not going to get there. So y'all can do the math and figure out your projection of how many years I'm going to play, but I'm not going to get to 300.\"\n\nRivers might also be the last to get into the 200 straight starts club for a while. Atlanta's Matt Ryan, who is in his 11th season, is second among active straight starts with 138 and Detroit's Matthew Stafford, who is in his 10th, has 119. Seattle's Russell Wilson, who has started every game since entering the league in 2012, is at 103 and wouldn't reach 200 until midway through the 2024 season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

If you are looking for an unexpected roster replacement or an inexpensive starter for your daily fantasy lineup, here are players who could help.\n\nThese deep sleepers are players flying under the radar whose matchups suggest they could have a big game in Week 9. Just remember, they are risky fantasy plays given the other options likely available.\n\nQB Alex Smith, Washington Redskins\n\nSmith hasn\u2019t been a very good fantasy football quarterback this season. However, this week he plays against a Falcons defense allowing a league-leading 348 yards and two or more touchdowns per game over their last three games. A 250-yard and multiple touchdown outing should not surprise. Smith is available in nearly six of every 10 fantasy football leagues.\n\nRB Duke Johnson, Cleveland Browns\n\nSimilarly, Johnson has been a disappointment for fantasy football team owners this season having only 29 targets in the passing game through eight games. Now that running backs coach Freddie Kitchens is the new Browns offensive coordinator, expect Johnson to see more touches, especially this week against a Chiefs defense that on the season has allowed the most receiving yards and third most rushing and passing touchdowns to opposing running backs. Johnson should see eight to 10 touches, which should translate to 60 to 80 all-purpose yards and a score. Johnson is available in a little more than half of the fantasy football leagues.\n\nFantasy rankings: How players stack up at each position in Week 9\n\nFantasy football sizzlers, fizzlers: Carolina offense runs through Cam Newton\n\nWR Calvin Ridley, Atlanta Falcons\n\nAfter totaling six touchdowns and 264 yards through the first four weeks of the season, Ridley has barely been on the fantasy football radar as he\u2019s failed to score a touchdown and been held to a meager 128 yards since. This week, the Falcons play a Redskins defense which should limit slot-man Mohamed Sanu and expend every effort to stop Julio Jones. Ridley should roam free and post a 60- to 80-yard performance and a score. Get Ridley off your bench and into your lineup.\n\nTE Chris Herndon, New York Jets\n\nA recommended waiver wire add this week and last, Herndon has emerged as a genuine red-zone threat in the Jets' passing offense having scored a touchdown in each of the last three games. The Jets play a Dolphins pass defense that has allowed four touchdowns in the past two games to tight ends. With the Jets' best wide receivers injured and likely to miss this week\u2019s game, the rookie should be good for 40 to 60 yards and a score.\n\nTennessee Titans defense/special teams\n\nIn a week in which six teams are on the bye, most of the best defenses are no longer available on waivers. The Titans defense, however, is available in most leagues. The Titans defense has been a middle of the road fantasy play all season and has a middle of the road matchup against the Dallas Cowboys this week. The Cowboys have allowed more fantasy points to opposing defenses as the weeks have worn on. In their last game, Dak Prescott was sacked four times and the Cowboys allowed a defense/special team\u2019s touchdown. The Titans are also coming off their bye week and have had an additional week to prepare. They\u2019re primed for a top 10 finish in a game that should be a defense/special teams battle.\n\nJim Saranteas, aka \"The Fantasy Greek,\" is a contributing writer for Ourlads.com, part of the USA TODAY Network.", "bad url", "", "", "By: Nick Schwartz | November 2, 2018 6:31 pm\n\nAll betting lines via William Hill.\n\nFriday, 7:30 p.m. ET \u2013 Pittsburgh (4-4) vs. No. 25 Virginia (6-2) \u2013 ESPN2 Point spread: Virginia -4 \u00a9 Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSaturday, 12:00 p.m. ET \u2013 Louisville (2-6) vs. No. 2 Clemson (8-0) \u2013 ABC Point spread: Clemson -38.5 \u00a9 AP Photo/Chuck Burton\n\n12:00 p.m. ET \u2013 Nebraska (2-6) vs. No. 10 Ohio State (7-1) \u2013 FOX Point spread: Ohio State -10.5 \u00a9 AP Photo/Nati Harnik\n\n12:00 p.m. ET \u2013 No. 19 Syracuse (6-2) vs. Wake Forest (4-4) \u2013 ACC Network Point spread: Syracuse -6 \u00a9 Mark Konezny-USA TODAY Sports\n\n12:00 p.m. ET \u2013 No. 20 Texas A&M (5-3) vs. Auburn (5-3) \u2013 ESPN Point spread: Auburn -3.5 \u00a9 AP Photo/Rogelio V.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The defense can't stop anybody, even a third-string, undrafted free agent quarterback making his NFL debut.\n\nThe banged-up offensive line is providing no protection for Derek Carr, leaving coach Jon Gruden so concerned about his quarterback's health that he was unwilling to call any down-field passes.\n\nThe rookie punter is in a major rut, unable to flip the field with his kicks.\n\nThe problems for the Oakland Raiders right now run deep and they were all exposed in a 34-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers that was the most lopsided of Gruden's 12 years as an NFL head coach.\n\nThe play that revealed the most issues might have been a 52-yard touchdown run by Raheem Mostert that made it 31-3 in the third quarter on Thursday night that featured several players appearing to play at less than top speed.\n\n\"I didn't have any problem at all with the effort,\" Gruden said. \"I think what I had a big problem with is we had two guys in the same gap and we got outflanked immediately and their back was faster than I think we anticipated. That was my big problem with the long run. Once again, defensively I think we gave up six plays for 240 yards. Six plays yielded 240 yards. That cannot happen and it continues to be a big part of our problem. We have to fix it.\"\n\nRight now, the Raiders (1-7) haven't been able to fix much of anything and are getting worse by the week. Oakland has lost four straight games, getting outscored by 85 points in the span.\n\nThe defense is allowing 6.76 yards per play, the worst by any team through eight games since the 1970 merger. The Raiders have allowed the second-most points as a franchise through eight games (252), are tied for the second-fewest takeaways (6) and have the fewest sacks (7). Oakland has also allowed opponents to have a 113.9 passer rating, a mark that only one team has ever been worse than over a full season.\n\nEven Nick Mullens managed to pick apart the defense in his NFL debut, joining Hall of Famers Fran Tarkenton and Jim Kelly as the only quarterbacks to throw for at least 250 yards and three TDs with no interceptions in their first career game.\n\nThose struggles have led to some heated sideline conversations between Gruden and defensive coordinator Paul Guenther, who still has the confidence of his head coach.\n\n\"I'm sure emotions get caught on tape sometimes but, there's not a better coach I know than Paul Guenther,\" Gruden said. \"There's not a better friend that I have than Paul Guenther. We're going to argue and jaw, probably tonight, deep into the night over a lot of things. I'll see if we can video footage for you.\"\n\nThe offense is dealing with its own woes as rookie left tackle Kolton Miller has been in and out of the lineup with a knee injury, left guard Kelechi Osemele re-injured his knee Thursday after missing the previous three games, backup left guard Jon Feliciano is dealing with a rib injury and rookie right tackle Brandon Parker has struggled since taking over for the injured Donald Penn.\n\nThe situation got so bad Thursday when Miller was forced to leave that Osemele had to move to left tackle after not practicing there all season.\n\nOsemele and Miller are being evaluated and could miss some time so the Raiders brought back former draft pick David Sharpe on Friday to take the place of tackle T.J. Clemmings, who is on injured reserve.\n\nOakland allowed eight sacks against San Francisco and Gruden pulled Carr to protect his health.\n\n\"Last night I was concerned,\" he said. \"Last night we didn't just have a couple of injuries, we were decimated and had guys playing positions that they had never really practiced. That was uncommon for any game I've ever called and I've called a lot of games. I've broadcast some games and I haven't seen that.\"\n\nEven the rookie punter is struggling. Oakland used a fifth-round pick on Johnny Townsend, who has struggled all season. His 25-yard punt two weeks ago set up Indianapolis' go-ahead score and he had a 23-yarder against San Francisco.\n\nTownsend is last in the NFL in gross punting average (41.9 yards) and has the second-lowest percentage of punts downed inside the 20 (18.8 percent).\n\n\"I think he's overthinking some things a little bit,\" Gruden said. \"Directional punting, putting the ball between the numbers to the side line to the right, to the left, getting it off quicker, whatever it may be. I make no excuses for Townsend, but I will say this, I have seen him bomb it. I have seen him be a difference maker and I am confident it's in our near future.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Chris Herndon is not the superstitious type. So, he's totally fine with talking about his three-game touchdown streak.\n\nThe New York Jets' rookie tight end would rather chat about something else, though.\n\n\"I mean, it's definitely nice to get into the end zone, but it feels a lot better when we're winning,\" Herndon said Friday. \"So, it's been fun these last three weeks, getting a few targets in the end zone and capitalizing on them, but ultimately I want us to win, so I don't try to focus on the stats.\"\n\nHerndon is the third rookie in franchise history to catch a TD pass in three straight games, joining fellow tight end Thurlow Cooper (1960) and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson (1996).\n\nBut, as he said, the end result hasn't always been there. His first NFL touchdown came in the Jets' 42-34 win over Indianapolis on Oct. 14, when he had a 32-yard grab.\n\nHerndon had a 12-yard catch against Minnesota the following week to tie the game at 7 late in the first quarter. New York ended up losing 37-17.\n\nLast week at Chicago, Herndon had a 16-yard TD reception in the Jets' disappointing 24-10 loss.\n\nHe'll try to make it four in a row \u2014 and, he hopes, with a victory \u2014 when New York travels to Miami, where Herndon played his college ball.\n\n\"I just think the offense slowed down for him,\" coach Todd Bowles said. \"I think from a mental standpoint, he's playing faster because he can see everything that's coming and his abilities are starting to take over without even thinking.\"\n\nHerndon was a fourth-round pick in April after a solid college career that was cut short last year by a knee injury. Some draft experts thought he could have been as high as a second-rounder if not for him being hurt.\n\n\"I'm definitely thankful to be here,\" he said. \"I don't take any of this for granted because at this time last year, I was dealing with being injured. So, just being able to play in a professional league, that alone is an honor.\n\nHe tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee before the Hurricanes were getting set to play in the ACC title game against Clemson. That was the end of his season and his career \u2014 but he refused to believe his NFL dreams would be over.\n\n\"I mean, not doubts,\" he said, \"but it wasn't necessarily the best time to, you know, go down.\"\n\nWith him slipping into the fourth round, the Jets took a chance on him even though he needed to continue rehabilitating his knee through the early part of the offseason.\n\nHerndon's role with the team was uncertain as New York had several tight ends on its roster during the spring. The 22-year-old native of Norcross, Georgia, also found himself in trouble with the law when he was arrested on June 2 for driving while intoxicated after flipping his car in New Jersey.\n\nHe was remorseful after the arrest , and thankful to the Jets for sticking by him during his legal issues. Herndon leaned on his faith while acknowledging that he had doubts about what was next for him.\n\n\"You kind of do, but that's when I just started praying more and letting God handle all that,\" he said. \"Just controlling all I can at that point. I was strong with it and I'm still learning and growing with it each day.\"\n\nHerndon could potentially be disciplined by the NFL for next season, but he will let that play out. His mind right now is on getting better \u2014 on and off the field.\n\nAnd, things are certainly looking up as far as his play.\n\nHerndon has 12 catches \u2014 seven in the last three games \u2014 for 161 yards and the three TDs, which tie him with Robby Anderson for the team lead. He and Philadelphia's Dallas Goedert have the most by a rookie tight end this season, and one more would break the Jets' single-season mark for rookies at the position \u2014 currently shared with Rich Caster (1970), Mickey Shuler (1978) and Dustin Keller (2008).\n\nAnd, Herndon has another eight games to do it.\n\n\"Yeah, I was actually kind of surprised when I heard that news,\" he said. \"I'm honestly just thankful.\"\n\nHerndon and rookie quarterback Sam Darnold were roommates for a stretch during training camp and developed a friendship off the field.\n\n\"Whenever we came home, either one of us had questions, especially me, because I'm the tight end, I just asked him,\" Herndon said. \"That kind of helped.\"\n\nNow, they're creating a bond on the field that's resulting in some big plays.\n\n\"First of all, he's is a great route runner,\" Darnold said. \"But also, he's a great run blocker, which helps in the pass game. It sets up play action and all that stuff. Whenever you have a versatile tight end like him, it always helps an offense.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Wade Payne, AP)\n\nFrom Abilene Christian University to Yale, an analysis released Friday showed that 147 college football programs had at least one former player diagnosed with the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\n\nThe Concussion Legacy Foundation made the data, culled from a study released earlier this year by Boston researchers, public on Friday. Georgia had the most former players (nine) diagnosed with CTE and each member school of a Power Five conference (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) had at least one player diagnosed.\n\n\"Very few colleges can say they haven\u2019t had a former player diagnosed with CTE,\" Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told USA TODAY Sports. \"There\u2019s still no long-term healthcare for former college players and no investment in research. Hopefully this will inspire changes for the next generation of football players.\"\n\nThe analysis listed some junior colleges and colleges \u2014 like Cheyney University of Pennsylvania \u2014 that have dropped their football programs.

Those brains \u2014 often donated by family members of deceased athletes \u2014 are more likely to have CTE since individuals studied commonly have ailments associated with the disease.\n\nResearchers believe earlier stages of CTE manifest in behavioral and mood symptoms \u2014 including impulsivity and anxiety \u2014 and more advanced stages can mirror symptoms often attributed to dementia and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nThere were 26 schools that had at least three CTE cases: Georgia (9), Michigan State (8), Auburn (5), Iowa (5), Ohio State (5), Purdue (5), South Carolina (5), USC (5), Wisconsin (5), Alabama (4) Arizona State (4), Arkansas (4), Boston College (4), Colorado State (4), Kansas State (4), Michigan (4).

(AP Photo/Larry Papke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Kurt Busch knows he took his first and only NASCAR Cup Series championship for granted.\n\nThe one that came 14 years ago with another team.\n\n\"If it happens again, I'll appreciate it that much more,\" Busch said Friday.\n\nNow 40 years old and with an uncertain future after this season with Stewart-Haas Racing, Busch arrived at Texas just outside the top four with two races left before the finale at Homestead, where four drivers will race for the championship. Three of those spots are still up for grabs.\n\n\"We have all the confidence in the world, we have all the right to be in the position we're in,\" said Busch, fifth in the standings and 25 points out of fourth. \"Black and white is we have to win. That way we control our destiny. We can still point our way in, and that's been our strength, the consistency of our team this year.\"\n\nWhile Busch is still trying to clinch a spot, Joey Logano is the only driver already locked in for Homestead after his bump-and-run to get past defending Cup champion Martin Truex Jr. at Martinsville last weekend.\n\nTruex was clearly upset after the race, when he vowed to prevent Logano from winning the title : \"He may have won the battle, but he ain't winning the damn war.\" He sent a text to Logano later Sunday night.\n\n\"I didn't expect to hear from him, so I wanted to tell him how I felt,\" Truex said Friday in Texas. \"I wanted to get his point of view and what he was thinking. What he thought about it. Now I know.\"\n\nLogano said he wasn't surprised to hear from Truex.\n\n\"I am glad he did. It kind of broke the ice,\" he said Friday. \"I was planning on waiting a couple days to let things settle. It got a lot of things out of the way. We both know where we stand. We know where it is at. It is what it is and we move on.\"\n\nSeven other drivers are still competing for the final three spots. All four Stewart-Haas drivers \u2014 Busch, Kevin Harvick, Clint Bowyer and Aric Almirola \u2014 are alive in the playoff chase, along with Truex, Kyle Busch and Chase Elliott.\n\nWhile Kurt Busch has no contract yet for 2019 \u2014 he said there is \"no movement on that\" at this point \u2014 he is focused on trying to get another championship with the No. 41 Ford.\n\n\"It hasn't been a distraction because I think the team and myself, we've all pushed that aside, and said let's focus on the now and getting the best that we can with the mindset, the crew guys, just the overall atmosphere,\" he said.\n\nAt Texas, Busch has 18 career top-10 finishes. He finished seventh here in April after winning a second consecutive pole at the 1 \u00bd-mile track. His was going for a third consecutive pole Friday, but instead qualified seventh \u2014 the lowest of the four Stewart-Haas drivers.\n\nBusch was driving for Jack Roush when he won his Cup title in 2004, having made his debut with that team in 2000. He went to Roger Penske in 2006, and drove for James Finch and Barney Visser before joining Gene Haas in 2014.\n\n\"When I chose to leave Roush Racing, I was young and I felt like the driver had more control over the situational events, and the way that a championship was brought together,\" Busch said. \"I realized quickly it's more of a team that brings everything together, and then beyond the team is the connections and the overall health of your program with NASCAR and the way that things work.\"\n\nIn his best season since winning the title, Busch finished fourth with Penske in 2009. His best since then was seventh for SHR two years ago. This season, Busch has 20 top-10 finishes, including one win among his six top-fives.\n\nBusch still remembers what crew chief Jimmy Fennig used to tell him when he was a young driver for Roush.\n\n\"If you think for one instance you can't win, make sure you go out and finish fifth,\" Busch recalled. \"That's the mindset that I take from that championship run, and it's helped me over the years. But the way you win now in this system is you have to win races to advance, and you have to win Homestead.\"\n\nAnd he knows he has to get there first.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Fred Vuich, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The Pittsburgh Steelers have an opportunity to create some mid-season separation in the AFC North.\n\nTo do that, they will have to beat the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore on Sunday, a venue where the Steelers have found it difficult to win and generate offense at times in the past.\n\n\"We just focus on this opportunity ahead of us,\" Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown said. \"We don't focus on the magnitude of the division. We know if we take care of our business, things will work out for themselves. It's another opportunity this week to do what we desire to do.\"\n\nThe first-place Steelers (4-2-1) have won three straight after a 1-2-1 start. Their last loss came Sept. 30 against the Ravens at Heinz Field, as the Steelers converted 2-of-12 third downs and rushed for just 19 yards in that game.\n\n\"I don't think there would be any player that would say they felt like they played their best game,\" Steelers' offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner said. \"And when we had a chance to look back through it, we were pretty critical of what we did and what we didn't do. It was a pretty good eye-opener.\"\n\nThe Steelers offense has found its stride since then, while Baltimore (4-4) has lost three of four. But the Ravens have experienced past success against the Steelers in Baltimore.\n\nThe Steelers beat the Ravens 26-9 last season in Baltimore. But prior to last season's win, the Steelers lost the previous four games and five of their last six road games against the Ravens dating back to September 2011.\n\nBrown has just 40 receptions for 427 yards and one touchdown in eight games at Baltimore. That's an average of five catches and 53 yards per game for the four-time All-Pro.\n\nBrown, who leads the league this season with eight touchdowns, has never had a 100-yard game against the Ravens in Baltimore.\n\n\"It's a tough place to play,\" Fichtner said. \"There's great fan support and it's loud. They get excited playing in their crowd. Snap-count is always an issue. We've had some big games there in my past 12 years here. It's an exciting place to play.\"\n\nRoethlisberger owns a career completion percentage of 64 percent, but he's completed just 57 percent of his passes in Baltimore.\n\nRoethlisberger, who ranks sixth in the league in passing yards this season, has never had a 300-yard game in Baltimore. He's thrown nine touchdowns to 13 interceptions at M&T Bank Stadium, and has been sacked 29 times in 10 games, including eight in the last four contests.\n\nThe Steelers are 3-6 in games Roethlisberger has started in Baltimore. Roethlisberger enters Sunday's game against the Ravens with a broken index finger on his non-throwing hand. He sustained the injury at some point in Pittsburgh's home win against Cleveland last Sunday.\n\nRoethlisberger fully practiced Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"Ben's a tough guy, and he's been through a lot,\" Brown said. \"He's one of the toughest ever to do it. You don't see him complaining. This guy's a warrior.\"\n\nBrown hopes the Steelers can pick up an important victory on Sunday at a place where wins and yards have been hard to come by.\n\n\"It's a hostile environment with fiery fans,\" Brown said. \"It's one of those environments you love to excel in. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go out and compete this weekend.\"\n\nNOTES: Steelers CBs Coty Sensabaugh (toe) and Artie Burns (ankle) are both questionable for Sunday's game, while OT Marcus Gilbert (knee) is doubtful.

The Rebels are struggling and have yet to win a conference game, but it's not a game the Bulldogs can overlook.\n\nNot after what happened last year: UNLV 26, Fresno State 16.\n\nThe loss was Fresno State's only blemish in Mountain West play last year and the Bulldogs haven't won in Las Vegas since 1996.\n\n\"I don't think you have to think too far back to understand that they came in here and beat us last year,\" Fresno State coach Jeff Tedford said. \"It was our only loss in conference play last year. They're very capable of doing that. If we don't play our best, that could happen.\"\n\nOn paper, the game is a massive mismatch.\n\nThe Bulldogs (7-1, 4-0) head into Las Vegas as more than two-touchdown favorites after climbing into the AP Top 25 and reaching No. 23 in the initial College Football Playoff rankings. They have held 19 straight teams under 30 points \u2014 longest such streak in the nation \u2014 are fourth nationally in turnover margin and have one of the nation's most accurate quarterbacks in Marcus McMaryion. Fresno State also has won six straight games and is winning by an average of about 25 points per game in conference.\n\nUNLV (2-6, 0-4) has lost five straight by more than 18 points per game, has one of the nation's worst defenses and a quarterback coming back from a foot injury.\n\n\"In college football, in any single week, you have to bring your 'A' game or you're not going to be successful,\" Tedford said. \"So it's really about that.\"\n\nA few more things to look for when No. 20 Fresno State plays at UNLV on Saturday:\n\nROGERS RETURNS? UNLV may have starting quarterback Armani Rogers back for Saturday's game. The sophomore has missed the past four games with a foot injury, but returned to practice this week. Rogers ran for 488 yards and six touchdowns, and threw for six more scores in four games before he was injured. Max Gilliam started the four games Rogers was out, and has thrown for 1,021 yards and 12 touchdowns with six interceptions this season. He's expected to start again Saturday.\n\n\"We're not going to rush him,\" UNLV coach Tony Sanchez said. \"We're going to make sure everything is good and stable.\"\n\nDOMINATING D: Fresno State's rise into the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2013 has come with a big boost from its smothering defense. The Bulldogs allow 13.5 points per game, tied for fourth nationally with Mississippi State, and are plus-1.75 in turnover margin. Fresno State is 15th nationally allowing 307.6 yards per game, and defensive back Anthoula Kelly leads the nation in passes defended with 15, including a team-leading three interceptions.\n\nMIGHTY MCMARYION: Fresno State quarterback Marcus McMaryion enters Saturday's game as the nation's most accurate passer at 70.4 percent. He's thrown for 2,142 yards and 18 touchdowns with two interceptions, putting up a quarterback rating of 167.2.

Their primary starting catcher had a $4.5 million option for next season with a $100,000 buyout.\n\n\"We wanted to explore some things in the marketplace.

He missed two months because of a fractured right elbow after getting hit by a pitch in April.\n\nThe Rangers last offseason exercised a $6 million club option on Perez before he broke a bone in his right (non-throwing) elbow that required surgery. This time, they chose a $750,000 buyout over a $7.5 million option after he went 2-7 with a 6.22 ERA in 22 games.

Fister began the season as the team's No. 2 starter, but went 1-7 with a 4.50 ERA in 12 starts before going on the disabled list in June with a strained right knee that kept him from pitching again.

Texas would have had to make an additional $6 million payment to the Cubs if the pitcher's option had been declined, triggering a $6 million buyout.\n\nSmyly signed a $10 million, two-year contract with Chicago last December that includes a $7 million salary for next year. He was healthy at the end of last season after recovering from Tommy John surgery. Daniels said Smyly had a physical in Texas, and is expected to have a normal offseason before spring training.\n\nFister was one of six right-handers Texas activated from the 60-day disabled list.

Critics of the law say minorities are more likely to have names with those features, thus making it harder for them to vote. The NAACP said about 70 percent of those affected by exact match in the state are black.\n\nOther people are also flagged as potential noncitizens, often because the state driver\u2019s license database hasn\u2019t been updated to reflect their naturalization. Roughly 51,100 Georgians have been flagged as ineligible to vote because of such registration problems.\n\nThe judge ruled the state unfairly burdened the 3,000 individuals whose registration was flagged for citizenship issues because only a deputy registrar is allowed to clear them to vote a regular ballot when the voters show proof of citizenship at the polls.\n\nShe noted voters flagged for issues other than citizenship can be cleared by any poll worker after showing a photo ID.\n\nA spokeswoman for state Attorney General Chris Carr did not immediately say whether the state would appeal.

And myself personally, a chance to win every single year, it doesn't come around like this in LA very often.\"\n\nThe money designated a signing bonus will not be subject to state income because Texas does not have a state income tax.\n\nWinner of the NL Cy Young in 2011, '13 and '14, Kershaw was limited to 26 starts this year because of a back injury and went 9-5 with a 2.73 ERA while striking out 155. The Dodgers lost in the World Series for the second straight season, with Kershaw taking the loss in Sunday's season-ending Game 5 defeat to Boston. His average fastball velocity dropped by 2 mph in the past year to 91 mph.\n\n\"I plan on getting back to that level that I was at,\" he said. \"There's a lot of guys older than me, and there's a lot of guys with more innings than me in the big leagues that are still maintaining their velocity.\"\n\nA herniated disk in his back sidelined him in 2016. He had a less significant back problem this year and a shoulder issue.\n\n\"No more DL time,\" he said. \"From there, hopefully the getting people out thing will take care of itself.\"\n\nAt 30, Kershaw has experienced a fastball velocity decrease, and he missed time this season because of two stints on the disabled.\n\n\"While I did have a little bit of a back issue this year, it wasn't very significant. I missed more time this year because of the shoulder,\" he said. \"I really believe that for three years I can be just as good as I ever have been. And I'm not saying I can't be good past that. But that's as long as I was willing to commit to right now.\"\n\nKershaw remains the face of the franchise and his dedicated work habits have filtered down to the younger pitchers on the staff.\n\n\"He's made as much of an impact as you can on an organization in terms of the success we've had,\" Andrew Friedman, president of baseball operations, said Thursday.\n\nKershaw has a career 153-69 regular-season record with a 2.39 ERA in 318 games but it's in the postseason where his numbers drop. He's 9-10 with a 4.32 ERA. He gave up four runs in seven innings in Game 5 of the World Series.\n\n\"Winning is still the most important thing for me,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The Green Bay Packers' Davante Adams can trace his ascent to becoming one of the most productive receivers in the NFL to a cold night in late November four years ago.\n\nThat game against the New England Patriots is proof of how much a rookie must be prepared at any time to step up, even against the toughest of opponents.\n\n\"Well I mean, I let everybody know as far as my approach to the game ever since I got here was just to be ready at all times,\" Adams said this week.\n\nIt's a lesson that the Packers' current crop of rookie receivers can draw from when Green Bay faces New England again on Sunday night at Foxboro.\n\nIn 2014, Adams took advantage of more looks when the Patriots decided to focus on then-top Packers wideout Jordy Nelson. Adams had six catches for 121 yards on 11 targets, getting as many receptions and targets as he had drawn the three previous games combined.\n\n\"Yeah, that was probably my coming out game,\" Adams said.\n\nNow Adams is quarterback Aaron Rodgers' top option, the receiver that usually draws an opponent's best cornerback. Adams has had at least 132 yards receiving in each of his last three games.\n\n\"Well, he's big for us. I think he can do it all from the wide receiver position and we're expecting a lot of attention by the Patriots secondary\" on Adams, coach Mike McCarthy said.\n\nIf that's the case, it could mean more looks for rookie wideouts Marquez Valdes-Scantling or Equanimeous St. Brown.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Valdes-Scantling has especially taken advantage of more work in recent games with injuries to starters Randall Cobb and Geronimo Allison. They returned last week, but Valdes-Scantling still caught a touchdown pass last week, his second in three games.\n\nAdams has offered simple, but important advice to the rookies, just like how Nelson did to Adams four years ago.\n\n\"Don't try to be (Adams.) Don't try to be Cobb, don't try to be (Allison). Don't try to be anybody else that you see,\" Valdes-Scantling said in recounting a piece of advice from Adams.\n\nValdes-Scantling could draw another start against the Patriots with Allison listed as doubtful for Sunday after injuring his groin in practice this week to go with an already sore hamstring. Cobb is questionable again with a hamstring injury but seems to be improving.\n\n\"Be yourself. Everybody does things well, but what you do well, just keep doing it,\" Valdes-Scantling added about Adams' advice.\n\nAdams has become an all-around receiver. Explosiveness and an ability to make moves allow him to gain extra yards after a catch.\n\nBut while the 26-21 win over the Patriots in 2014 might have been his springboard, it took a while for Adams to gain the kind of consistency that now makes him an important part of the offense.\n\nFor example, following the Patriots game, Adams managed just four catches for 29 yards over his last four regular-season games combined in 2014. Then he had seven catches for 117 yards and a score in a 26-21 win in the playoffs over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nAdams has 28 touchdown catches since the 2016 season. Opposing secondaries have caught on to Adams' rise, yet he's still coming up clutch for Rodgers.\n\n\"He's going to look to guys who maybe he hasn't looked to as much coming up,\" Adams said. \"If that's how they decide to go about the game, remove (me) from the game, I'm still going to do my best to contribute as much as I can to this offense. I know the rest of the guys will be ready as well.\"\n\nLinebacker Nick Perry (ankle) and safety Jermaine Whitehead (back) are the only other players on the injury report, listed as questionable for Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nForward Carmelo Anthony, a newcomer in Houston, and the Rockets are 1-5. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe most dismal team in pro basketball right now is the same one recently predicted by many to become the best, or darn close to it. Houston Rockets, please step forward as Exhibit A in the theoretical discussion that neither reputation, expectation nor past performance counts for anything in the modern NBA.\n\nThe Rockets currently hold the distinction of being the league\u2019s biggest chokers, a description you might not have thought possible in early November. But being a choker isn\u2019t restricted to failing down the stretch, or stumbling in the postseason.\n\nIt applies perfectly to this sorry group, which seemed to have a position as one of the league\u2019s dominant elite at its fingertips for the next few years. The Rockets, at a heady time in May that suddenly feels like long, long ago, were a storming juggernaut that reeled off 65 wins and crushed their way to a 3-1 lead over the almighty Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference finals.\n\nA Chris Paul hamstring strain hastened the end of the dream run, but no matter, this was the campaign when Houston had a perfect chance to put things right. Right?\n\nWrong, at least if the opening portion of the season is anything to go by. Even after beating Brooklyn to open a three-game, four-night trip, the Rockets have slumped to 2-5, losing all four home games and playing basketball at a truly miserable level.\n\nThey have been disjointed, absent of ideas, and painful to watch at times, almost as excruciating as the bewildered attempts to explain their poor play.\n\nIt might just be that \u201cwhen it goes bad it goes bad\u201d (Carmelo Anthony), or they have \u201clost their swagger\u201d (coach Mike D\u2019Antoni). Either way, they are \u201cplaying like crap\u201d (D\u2019Antoni again) and it is nothing short of \u201cembarrassing\u201d (P.J. Tucker).\n\nThere have been a couple of reasons conspiring against them but nothing that would suggest such a remarkable drop off. James Harden has been banged up and missed the past two games, although when he has been on the floor he has managed 28.5 points per game, to no avail.\n\n'Shut Up and Dribble': James-produced documentary looks at alternate history of NBA\n\nLeBron's Lakers among the top six hot messes in the NBA\n\nPaul got a two-game ban for his role in the Rajon Rondo fisticuffs in Los Angeles, couldn\u2019t regather his mojo upon returning and found the burden of shouldering the offensive load without Harden too much.\n\nAnthony, added in the offseason, has turned out to be nothing more than a defensive liability, one that makes the decisions to let Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute leave over the summer more cause for headshaking than they seemed at the time.\n\nHouston is \u201cnot the same team\u201d (Tucker). You can say that again.\n\nThere are plenty of stats that bear out the grisly details. They are 26th in defense, and 26th in net rating.\n\nBut more than anything the Rockets look like a team that has had the soul sucked out of it. They haven\u2019t had the toughness to withstand spirited runs. They were exposed most severely by one of the league\u2019s hardest working teams, the Los Angeles Clippers (twice), and by one of its most energetic, the Portland Trail Blazers. They couldn\u2019t handle the physical threat of Anthony Davis and the Pelicans on opening night, suffering a beat down that looked like a blip but has turned into a monster.\n\nIt is glaringly obvious that a reset is needed. The problem is a mental revival is not an easy thing to do in the middle of a frenetic schedule when you\u2019re getting beaten all over the court. So many teams are better than the Rockets right now, and not the kind of teams they thought they\u2019d be looking up at.\n\nForget the Warriors, they are in a different stratosphere. But the Sacramento Kings are way better, the Clippers are better, even the Minnesota Timberwolves with all their discord and the Los Angeles Lakers with their new normal are better. Even the Phoenix Suns have gotten a home win. The New York Knicks can\u2019t do anything right but have won a couple of games, while the Bulls think \u201cD\u201d is a musical note but have somehow triumphed twice. No wonder Houston general manager Daryl Morey tried to send an eternity\u2019s worth of draft picks to Minnesota in exchange for Jimmy Butler.\n\nWho knows when things might get better for Houston? The Rockets are still full of talent, and in Harden possess a player capable of controlling games on his own. But they are a train wreck now and there is no end in sight.\n\nBecause while other teams are bad, Houston is heading toward the three-week mark of an extensive choke job. And, in the process, hurling away the chance to be a contender because they didn\u2019t have the fortitude to get out of their own heads, and into their stride.\n\nFollow Rogers on Twitter @RogersJourno", "Houston Texans wide receiver Demaryius Thomas catches the ball during NFL football practice in Houston, Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018.

(Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) \u2014 The Denver Broncos will be without starters Bradley Roby, Darian Stewart, Brandon Marshall and rookie returner DaeSean Hamilton for their game against the Houston Texans on Sunday.\n\nThe Broncos activated safety Su'a Cravens off injured reserve and replaced receiver Isaiah McKenzie with River Cracraft on Friday.\n\nWith right tackle Jared Veldheer returning from a knee injury, the Broncos (3-5) finally have the luxury of giving left tackle Garett Bolles some plays off to try to settle him down and break his holding habit. He leads the league with seven flags this season after an NFL-high 10 last year.\n\nThe Broncos could either put Veldheer in his spot or move Billy Turner over from the right side.\n\nThey'll replace Roby, who has struggled in his adjustment from nickel back to starter following the offseason trade of Aqib Talib to the Rams, with a mix of veterans Tramaine Brock and Adam Jones and rookie Isaac Yiadom.\n\nAlong with Chris Harris Jr., those three will face Texans star DeAndre Hopkins and ex-teammate Demaryius Thomas, who was traded to Houston on Tuesday .\n\nAdams missed practice Friday for non-injury reasons that won't affect his playing status.\n\n\"He'll be back tonight. He had a family matter,\" coach Vance Joseph said. \"We got Brock, we've got Adam and we've got Isaac, outside of Chris, obviously. We're fine. We're in good shape and we've got four healthy guys for the game.\"\n\nJoseph said pass rusher Shane Ray (ankle) looked good in practice and is ready to return to help Von Miller, Bradley Chubb and Shaq Barrett rush the passer Sunday.\n\n\"I've been proud of how Shane's rehabbed and how he's practiced the last two days. He looks fine and ready to go,\" Joseph said.\n\nUntil now the Broncos were limited in their options for Bolles, who keeps giving up pressures and sacks, and Roby, who keeps allowing too much cushion and big plays by not jamming receivers or playing the ball on deep passes.\n\nThree weeks ago, Joseph said he didn't fear losing the locker room over his patience with Bolles and Roby, saying, \"They all understand we're playing the best players.\" He said Bolles and Roby had to fix their flaws in the glare of games rather than through a benching.\n\n\"We have some options now with Jared back and (with) Billy playing at a high level,\" Joseph said Friday. \"We do have some options there, so we'll see how the game goes.\"\n\nAs for Cravens, the Broncos are hoping he's a wild card for them over the last half of the season.\n\n\"He could be. His body type and skill set as a dime backer is valuable because he can play first, second and third down,\" Joseph said.\n\nWith Marshall's lingering knee injury, linebacker Alexander Johnson looks to get his first action.\n\n\"He's a guy who wants to play, first of all,\" Joseph said. \"He's got a unique body. He's a big body who can really run. We'll see how he helps us on teams, and obviously, if he's playing on defense, we'll see what happens there. He's a guy who was eager to play and help us.\"\n\nAnd it's starting to look as though wide receiver/returner Jordan Taylor, who has been on PUP, might go on season-ending IR next week because he's not quite 100 percent after offseason double-hip surgery.\n\n\"He's trying to get right for us, but he's really sore,\" Joseph said. \"If he was right, he would be able to play, but he's not right yet.\"\n\nThe Broncos listed rookie running back Royce Freeman (ankle) as questionable, but Joseph said that with the bye next week, it might be best to keep him out against the Texans (5-3).\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It marked the first time since 2001 that USC has a record of .500 or worse heading into November.\n\nAddressing the team's struggles, coach Clay Helton dismissed offensive line coach Neil Callaway and took away the play-calling responsibilities from offensive coordinator Tee Martin, who remains on staff.\n\n\"I just thought it was the appropriate time,\" Helton said. \"I've had the itch to get back, more integrated with the offense. Being in year three of being the head coach and feeling more comfortable with the role and the job of head coach, the duties that come with it, I know the lay of the land now.\"\n\nWhile the Trojans made adjustments, the Beavers (2-6, 1-4) were still celebrating their 41-34 overtime victory at Colorado last weekend. It was the team's first conference win since 2016 and snapped a 22-game road losing streak dating to 2014.\n\n\"There was a lot of excitement, the kids were fired up. Obviously a lot of hugs with those guys, especially the senior class. They have been through so much. So there is some energy and just pure joy,\" first-year coach Jonathan Smith said afterward.\n\nWell, celebrating to a point. Oregon State still went into halftime with a 24-3 deficit and surrendered an early second-half touchdown.\n\n\"There's a lot to clean up,\" Smith said. \"You're never really shooting to come out down 31-3.\"\n\nOther things to know about the USC-Oregon State matchup:\n\nUSC's QB: Helton said freshman quarterback JT Daniels had cleared concussion protocol but wasn't going to see contact this week in practice. He added that he expected Daniels would be ready to go against the Beavers. Daniels suffered the concussion two weeks ago against Utah. Redshirt freshman Jack Sears started against the Sun Devils and threw for 235 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nOREGON STATE'S QB: Oregon State started sophomore Jack Colletto against Colorado while Conor Blount recovered from a concussion. However, Jake Luton, who had been out with a high ankle sprain since Sept. 15, was inserted early in the second half and wound up throwing for 310 yards and three touchdowns. He was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week.\n\nSmith said this week that Blount had still not been cleared to play, so Luton will get the start against USC.\n\nHISTORY: USC leads the all-time series 62-11. The Beavers' last win came in 2010 with a 36-7 rout at Reser. USC has won the meetings since then in 2013, 2014 and 2017. Oregon State's last win over a conference opponent at home was the 2016 Civil War.\n\nSUPPORTING TEE: Receiver Michael Pittman Jr. had nothing but praise for how Martin was handling the situation.\n\n\"I'm just like the player, so I just play in a system. I just get the plays and I just run them. It's not a big switch up to me, but one thing I did notice is I feel like Coach Tee came out here with a really positive attitude. He's coaching real hard. He's just keeping his spirits up, and I really feel that he's putting all of his heart into us as wideouts now and I can feel his energy more. He's not having a pity party,\" said Pittman, who leads the team with 27 catches for 561 yards and six touchdowns.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A joint effort between their respective teams, Hendrick Motorsports and McLaren, the drivers made the announcement together by tweeting the same video Friday.\n\nIt all started back in January when the two racing greats were talking at a NASCAR media day, and Alonso mentioned something about trying out each other\u2019s very different cars and Johnson jumped at the idea, ESPN reported from NASCAR\u2019s weekend at Texas Motor Speedway. After the NASCAR finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway on November 18, 43-year-old Johnson will jet off to London and work with a simulator.\n\nVia ESPN:\n\nThe downforce in the F1 car is about six times that of a NASCAR Cup car, Johnson said. The braking zones are much deeper toward the turn in an F1 car than in a stock car. \u201cIt is the ultimate car,\u201d Johnson said about testing the F1 car. \u201cThat\u2019s by design what they\u2019ve created for a vehicle. Our vehicles are much more entertainment-based, certainly a lot of fun to drive. \u201cBut to feel the downforce of one of those cars has always been in the back of my mind. I\u2019ve always wanted to experience it.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement, however, isn\u2019t related to the future of either driver. Alonso, 37, is retiring from F1 at the end of the season, and there has been ample speculation about him racing in the IndyCar Series after competing in the 2017 Indianapolis 500.\n\nNASCAR has also lobbied him to try the Daytona 500 in February, and Johnson told ESPN he doesn\u2019t see a full-time Cup Series ride in Alonso\u2019s future.\n\nJohnson is under contract with Hendrick through the 2020 season, and he has yet to seriously talk about retiring. More via ESPN:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything inked for 2021, but a 45-year-old F1 driver, I don\u2019t think has ever happened,\u201d Johnson said with a laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019ll put that out there.\u201d", "bad url", "CLOSE Home sellers are hopping on a growing trend of spying on potential buyers through surveillance cameras.

Nine percent of those homebuyers this year were buying a home for the first time.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an older first-time buyer or this is your second go-around, a house purchase later in life comes with considerations unique to seniors.\n\nHere is what you need to think about:\n\nWhere is the cash coming from?\n\nMany older homebuyers use the sale proceeds of a previous home to fund a new purchase without tapping other sources. But if you need money from elsewhere, be smart about where you get the funds.\n\nIf you use retirement savings, make sure you\u2019re old enough to avoid incurring a penalty for early withdrawal. In some cases, you may be exempt if you\u2019re a first-time homebuyer.\n\nIf you take from regular brokerage accounts, don\u2019t forget about the tax consequences.\n\n\u201cSay you cash in $100,000 worth of stocks,\u201d says Peter Palion, a certified financial planner in East Meadow, New York. \u201cThe next year, you owe $20,000 in taxes. That\u2019s not the kind of surprise you want.\u201d\n\n\n\nDo you plan to age in place?\n\nThink carefully if the home you plan to purchase will meet your needs five, 10 and 20 years down the road when your health changes.\n\nDo you expect to have live-in care at some point? Then, the house should be able to accommodate another person. Or, consider buying a condo, a more affordable and easier-to-maintain option,\n\n\u201cPeople tend to be flippant about how they are going to be at 75 or 80,\u201d says Terrence Herr, managing partner of Herr Capital Management in Chicago. \u201cThey discount the potential health and mobility issues.\u201d\n\n\n\nCan you afford the expenses long term?\n\nConsider whether your retirement savings and expected withdrawal rate can support a mortgage payment, if you take one out.\n\nA fixed mortgage payment appeals to many homebuyers who worry increasing rent could become a burden in later years.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to add in costs for property taxes, insurance, home association fees and maintenance, especially if you expect to someday outsource regular upkeep like mowing the lawn or shoveling snow.\n\nCan you swallow these costs along with others that crop up later in life, such as higher medical expenses? Be conservative, advises Herr. \u201cIf a home purchase turns out to be a poor financial decision, you simply don\u2019t have time to recover from that,\u201d he says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/02/housing-market-questions-senior-homebuyers-need-ask/1848764002/", "The Supreme Court will decide whether the \"Peace Cross,\" a memorial to World War I veterans in Bladensburg, Maryland, must be removed from public land because of religious connotations.

In recent years, it ruled that a Missouri church could receive federal funds, private corporations could avoid federal health regulations regarding contraceptives, and a New York town could open meetings with Christian prayers.\n\nThe 40-foot cross was built in 1925 by the American Legion and \"a group of bereaved mothers,\" according to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, which wants it left alone. Honoring 49 men from Prince George's County who died in the war, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe commission took over the property in 1961 and maintains it with public funds. It sits in a three-way highway median that is now the county's busiest intersection.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, ruled 8-6 last October that the Latin cross is the \"pre-eminent symbol of Christianity\" and ordered it removed or destroyed. It sided with opponents in ruling that the memorial appears to honor Christian veterans above others.\n\nThe commission and American Legion say that's not the case. They argue that the monument had a secular dedication and has been used as the location for patriotic events dating back nearly a century. The cross, they say, represents the symbol of World War I dead.\n\n\"This court has recognized that passive displays \u2013 particularly displays that have stood without challenge for decades \u2013 may constitutionally employ religious symbols in order to convey a predominantly nonreligious message,\" they argue in court papers.\n\nNearly 20 military, veteran, religious and conservative groups urged the Supreme Court to step in, a huge number for a case that had yet to be granted. Lawyers for the commission and American Legion say if allowed to stand, the appeals court ruling will imperil hundreds of similar monuments on public land, including those in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\u201cOne group\u2019s agenda shouldn\u2019t diminish the sacrifice made by America\u2019s veterans and their families,\" said David Cortman, senior counsel for the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom. \"The offended feelings of a passer-by does not amount to a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nThe group challenging the memorial calls it a \"Christian cross monolith\" that's in poor condition and is a safety hazard. Government funding for maintenance and restoration, it says, represents \"excessive entanglement with religion.\"\n\nIt also disagrees that the monument was secular from the start, contending that it was conceived as a \"Calvary Cross\" to symbolize Jesus Christ's crucifixion and that events held over the decades have featured Christian-themed prayers.\n\nRachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said veterans can be honored \"in ways that don\u2019t promote a particular religion and that respect the religious diversity of Maryland\u2019s citizens, including veterans. We urge the Supreme Court to affirm that this cross is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nFederal appeals courts have ruled differently on similar memorials. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented as an appeals court judge in 2010 when the 10th Circuit refused to reconsider a panel's decision that memorial crosses violate the Constitution.\n\n\u201cOur court has now repeatedly misapplied the \u2018reasonable observer\u2019 test, and it is apparently destined to continue doing so until we are told to stop,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\nNow the Supreme Court, with five conservative justices following the confirmation of Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh last month, could issue just such an admonition.\n\nMore: Supreme Court rules on narrow grounds for baker who refused to create same-sex couple's wedding cake\n\nMore: Five takeaways from Supreme Court's decision in favor of Colorado baker who turned away gay couple\n\nMore: What the First Amendment protects \u2014 and what it doesn't\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/02/supreme-court-decide-if-peace-cross-war-memorial-can-survive/1612766002/", "", "FILE - In this Oct. 21, 2018, file photo, Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry (22) carries the ball during an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Chargers in London.

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Derrick Henry possibly is running out of time with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nThe 2015 Heisman Trophy winner talked a month ago about needing to run better and be more physical. Three games later, nothing much has changed \u2014 for now. Henry is still the starter, though Dion Lewis is making a case for that spot. It's Lewis who is coming off the best rushing game this season by a Tennessee running back.\n\n\"We all know, you guys all know, if you're inconsistent in this league, they'll find somebody to replace you,\" Henry said. \"So I feel like the biggest thing is just being consistent during everything that I do. Being efficient, finishing runs, being physical, running hard. Like I said, I stood in front of y'all and said all those things, but I don't feel like I've done those things.\"\n\nHenry is in his third season after being the Titans' third pick in the 2016 draft out of Alabama. Lewis is the free agent general manager Jon Robinson signed in March to a four-year deal.\n\nDuring the Titans' bye last week, Henry studied each of those 84 carries and evaluated himself. He found plenty he can do better by running like the 6-foot-3, 247-pound back he is. Henry is averaging a career-worst 3.3 yards per carry. Lewis leads Tennessee in rushing with 277 yards \u2014 4 more than Henry who's had 11 more carries this season.\n\nThe Titans (3-4) need an improved running game having lost three straight, and they rank 19th in the NFL averaging only 107.9 yards rushing per game. They had a season-high 164 yards rushing Oct. 21 in London, and Lewis was a big key running for a season-high 91 yards. Lewis finished with a career-best 155 yards from scrimmage.\n\nAsked about Henry, Titans coach Mike Vrabel said they have to find ways to clean up mistakes across the offense that have cost yards. That includes finishing runs better.\n\n\"There are times if you look at yourself and say, 'Man, I could have done a better job.' I think that's what Derrick is doing,\" Vrabel said. \"I appreciate that mentality from him. He can do more and we all can do more.\"\n\nTennessee signed fullback Jalston Fowler on Monday to add another blocker to the offensive mix. The Titans visit Dallas (3-4) and know the Cowboys will be running the ball with Ezekiel Elliott who's second in the NFL with 619 yards rushing. That makes getting the run game working better crucial against a Dallas defense ranked third in fewest yards allowed and ninth against the run, giving up 96.3 yards per game.\n\nOffensive coordinator Matt LaFleur said the Titans' coaches and players still have plenty of confidence in Henry. But Henry has to make the most of his opportunities with the ball.\n\n\"He's a big back, and any time you're a big back, you want to make sure you're finishing runs,\" LaFleur said. \"He's done a pretty good job of that. We've just got to get him going. We've got to get him going, and I think it's a matter of time before we're able to do it. But really it takes everybody. It's not just Derrick. It takes all 11.\"\n\nNotes: Both starting guards practiced fully Friday, including RG Josh Kline (ankle) who was limited Thursday. WR Corey Davis (hamstring) was limited for a second straight day. S Kenny Vaccaro, who has missed the past three games with an elbow injury, practiced fully for a second straight day.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

Smith said earlier this week on The Paul Finebaum Show that the Crimson Tide\u2019s particular brand of dominance this season has made college football boring. So maybe the sport needs the No. 1 team in the country to fall in Death Valley on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not advocating this because I don\u2019t have any more influence on the outcomes of the game than you do or anyone else, but the best thing Saturday night would be for Alabama to lose,\u201d Finebaum told For The Win by phone Friday while promoting Pilot Flying J for SEC and college football fans.\n\n\u201cIt would be a wake-up call. All of a sudden, people would go \u2018Whoa, hold on a second. This thing\u2019s getting pretty interesting, this thing\u2019s getting pretty exciting.\u2019 Just because you think something might make the sport better doesn\u2019t mean it will, but Alabama winning again this year will not be good for college football.\u201d\n\nTua fires another touchdown, but takes a hit in the process. pic.twitter.com/au8WdcYuYN \u2014 SEConCBS (@SEConCBS) October 20, 2018\n\nComing off a bye week with the No. 1 offense in the country led by quarterback and Heisman Trophy favorite Tua Tagovailoa, the season\u2019s narrative has revolved around Nick Saban\u2019s team being the best, by far, and everyone else is an afterthought.\n\n\u201cAlabama has sucked some of the oxygen out of college football this year,\u201d Finebaum continued.\n\nThat said, the analyst still thinks the Crimson Tide will remain undefeated after this weekend, although the LSU game is just the beginning of the most challenging part of the team\u2019s season.\n\nAfter Saturday, it faces Mississippi State, The Citadel and Auburn, and it will most likely take on Georgia in the SEC championship game, he predicted. To get to the conference title game, the Bulldogs have to win Saturday against Kentucky.\n\nBut no team has challenged Alabama so far this season outside of Texas A&M, which still lost by 22 points in Week 5.\n\n\u201cThe X factor here is the unknown because of Alabama\u2019s schedule, which I think we can all agree has been pretty bad,\u201d Finebaum said looking at the LSU game and citing a 2-6 Louisville team as the Crimson Tide\u2019s best nonconference opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just a matter of whether Tua can handle the moment tomorrow night. Can he deal with the unknown? I think he can, but we don\u2019t have anything to back that up.\n\n\u201cThe counter argument would be, \u2018Well, he did it in the national championship game (last season),\u2019 but the circumstances were different. He came off the bench, Alabama was in a desperate situation. Yeah, he threw a walk-off winner, but it\u2019s a little different being the starter, having the pressure and then trying to deal with adversity if something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nThinking about rolling up to #SECNation in this thing tomorrow.

There\u2019s the possibility that a wild crowd combined with LSU\u2019s defense \u2014 which is tied for No. 1 in the country in interceptions (14) \u2014 could be enough to catch Tagovailoa and the Crimson Tide off-balance.\n\nThat\u2019s the Tigers\u2019 best chance for an upset as two-touchdown underdogs, Finebaum explained.\n\n\u201cLSU can win this game if Alabama comes out and turns the ball over, maybe for a touchdown, maybe gets rattled,\u201d he said. \u201cHeaven forbid \u2014 and I say this on both sides \u2014 an injury at the quarterback position. I think that is the danger for Alabama because Jalen Hurts, who would normally be the best backup in America, he\u2019s hurt too. \u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the nervous factor. Having been to LSU many, many times, if you find yourself behind and you\u2019re out of rhythm and things are going haywire, that place becomes much more difficult. For all the conversation about Tiger Stadium on Saturday night, if you\u2019re leading, it\u2019s not that big a deal.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re behind and you\u2019re out of sorts, it can be like a horror chamber.\u201d", "WACO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Oklahoma State running back Justice Hill had a breakout performance with his first 100-yard rushing game two years ago as a freshman playing at Baylor.\n\nHe also lost two fumbles, including a crucial one late in the loss.\n\n\"We knew he was going to be a good player, but we just had discussions with him about the importance of protecting the ball,\" coach Mike Gundy said this week. \"That could very well be the determining factor in most college games when talent is relatively the same. Since then he's done a nice job taking care of the ball. He took it serious.\"\n\nThere haven't been any fumble issues since and Hill returns to Waco this weekend as one of the Big 12's best running backs. Oklahoma State (5-3, 2-3 Big 12), coming off a big home win over Big 12 leader Texas, plays Saturday at Baylor (4-4, 2-3).\n\nIn that 2016 game against the Bears, Hill ran for 122 yards and a score. But his second lost fumble, near the goal line in the fourth quarter, came when Oklahoma State had the chance to take the lead. He ran for 117 yards and a touchdown against Baylor last season.\n\nNow a junior, Hill's 3,385 career rushing yards are sixth among active players nationally and the most for a non-senior playing at a Power Five school. He has 18 career 100-yard games. He is third in the Big 12 this season with 97 yards rushing per game after leading the league last season, when he ran for 1,467 yards (112.8 per game) while playing for the nation's top passing team.\n\n\"He's a big-time, big-time, bigtime back. He's a pro-style running back,\" Baylor coach Matt Rhule said. \"He is a complete back. He's dynamic. He's got great vision, he's tough, he's physical, but he also can take it the distance.\"\n\nBEARS QB\n\nWith quarterback Charlie Brewer in concussion protocol this week, it appears that graduate transfer Jalan McClendon will get his first college start Saturday for Baylor. He has appeared in seven games this season for Baylor, taking over for Brewer in the second quarter of the Oct. 25 loss at West Virginia.\n\n\"I have all of the confidence in the world in Jalan,\" Rhule said. \"He is smart, tough and competitive. His teammates respond to him and he has a big-time arm.\"\n\nMcClendon has competed 42 of 61 passes (68.9 percent) for 542 yards with three touchdowns and one interception for Baylor. He played in 19 games without a start at North Carolina State before transferring this summer.\n\nWHERE MASON STARTED\n\nBefore Hill in 2016, Oklahoma State had another big freshman introduction at Waco in 2014 when the Cowboys took the redshirt off highly touted freshman Mason Rudolph. Rudolph lost his first start that day, but went on to become the winningest quarterback in school history. Taylor Cornelius, the former walk-on who backed up Rudolph the past three seasons, has thrown for 2,335 yards with 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions in what will be his only season as the Cowboys starter.\n\nFORGETTING WVU\n\nBaylor is playing for the first time since their Oct. 25 game at West Virginia, which jumped out to a 41-0 halftime lead on way to a 59-14 victory.\n\n\"We are ready to come back from that disappointing loss and disappointing performance,\" Rhule said. \"They players addressed the game (the day after the game) during a player-only meeting where they watched the tape and tried to get some things corrected.\"\n\nOUT OF THE CFP\n\nOklahoma State was one of only five teams \u2014 including Alabama, Clemson, Oklahoma and Ohio State \u2014 that was in every College Football Playoff ranking from the start of 2015 through the end of last season. The Cowboys had their streak in the top 25 CFP ranking end when the first CFP ranking of this season came out this week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Pat Quinn four years ago.\n\nHe acknowledges the sum is enormous. But he said it would be political malpractice to \u201cunilaterally disarm.\u201d\n\nHe also justified his spending by noting that Rauner has aligned himself with deep-pocketed, conservative donors \u2013 wealthy hedge fund executive Ken Griffin and billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch \u2013 who back Republican candidates who seek to cut taxes and reduce government regulation of industries.\n\n\"He outspent his opponent 2 to 1 (in 2014), and now he\u2019s complaining about it?\u201d Pritzker asked.\n\n\u201cThe fact is we have to win to get change,\" he told USA TODAY. \"And the real change we\u2019re trying to do is put Springfield back on the side of working families and not on the side of the Koch brothers and people like Bruce Rauner who are standing up for the most unfair tax system in the country.\u201d\n\nIllinois Democratic governor candidate J.B.

His first child, a son, was born over the summer; those first organized games, and the inevitable questions about \u201celite\u201d travel teams and personal coaches that follow all too quickly, remain years away.\n\n\u201cI can imagine it must be so much worse now,\u201d said Polsky, 39. \u201cI\u2019m almost sick to my stomach just thinking about it. But at root, the issue remains the same: Everybody thinks about being great, but nobody, most notably coaches, truly thinks about how to actually get there, and the paths we\u2019ve created are not only wrong, they sap away all the things that could allow a young athlete to actually flourish.\u201d\n\nPolsky, whose 2014 film Red Army about the storied Soviet Union national hockey team received rave reviews, said the idea for his newest film \u2014 which debuts in 11 cities tonight and more next week \u2014 grew out of his own experiences decades ago. He\u2019d silently question the rigidity of practices and grow confused as he watched Wayne Gretzky play hockey one way while his coaches demanded he play the opposite way. A frustrating career at Yale \u2014 he scored seven points in 27 games over 3 seasons before leaving the team \u2014 left him convinced that the subject needed to be explored.\n\nSo he sat down with Gretzky to ask questions he\u2019d always wanted to ask. Gretzky has long been seen as an outlier, a player we would never be able to understand, let along replicate. He had no discernible physical skills that would set him apart. Not speed. Not size. Not strength. So his success was attributed largely to a level of hockey IQ so preternatural it was not worth even aspiring to.\n\nGretzky, as Polsky expected, found that idea ridiculous.\n\n\u201cIn some ways it can be a difficult thing to even ask about, because what I\u2019m trying to get to is the idea of artistry and creativity, and those things aren\u2019t talked about in sports,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact they\u2019re looked down upon.\n\n\u201cBut Wayne took me there. That\u2019s where his mind went.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a scene in the film when, as Gretzky is getting prepped to officially sit for an interview, Polsky wonders aloud if he\u2019d like to hear some of the questions and topics he\u2019ll be bringing up. But Gretzky quickly replies that he\u2019s more comfortable answering questions without thinking about them beforehand.\n\nThat sort of freedom to read and react, Polsky argues with the film, is an essential key to greatness and is cultivated not through repeated drills but free-flowing, unstructured play meeting unfettered passion. Gretzky recalls his hours spent alone working on the game he loved. And the times spent on the backyard rink, playing shinny with his brothers and neighbors for nothing but pride. And nights spent tracing the path of the puck as it moved around his television screen. He fell in love with the game through play and curiosity, not by being in the \u201cright\u201d league or working \u201charder\u201d than every other kid.\n\nPolsky also speaks at length with Jerry Rice and Pele \u2014 two others he considers the uncontested greatest in their sports. He also intersperses interviews with David Epstein, author of The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance, and Sir Ken Robinson, an expert on education and the role of creativity within it. Speeches from Alan Watts, who popularized Eastern philosophy in the U.S., are used as sign posts throughout the film (the above trailer begins with one.)\n\nPolsky built the film carefully, working systematically toward a conclusion that should be obvious even to those who, in his mind, rely too much on systemic training methods and conformity. His story may be about greatness and the uncomplicated joy it can bring but it is also more than that, as his efforts to recruit youth teams to see the film shows; he has a very clear message he feels should be heard. The film rails against sports specialization and the over-scheduled lives fostered by an increasingly hyper-competitive environment. But it also delivers earnest and open conversation with transcendent athletes, bringing them ever so closer to us.\n\nI\u2019m not sure the film successfully decodes what made Gretzky, Rice or Pele great. Because those players where magical, and in sports there\u2019s still magic \u2014 even after all the ways we\u2019ve learned to break it down and count it up. They are artists. They surprise us. It\u2019s why we watch.\n\nBut In Search of Greatness is an engrossing and important look at what not to do. You can\u2019t help but see all the ways we\u2019re extinguishing the possibility of play blossoming into greatness, and how damaging the maw of youth sports has become. Because it doesn\u2019t spit only the weak or undedicated to the side, as we too often like to pretend. It could have discarded Gretzky and Rice and Pele \u2014 or at least kept them from ever becoming who they were.", "bad url", "", "FLORHAM PARK, N.J.

Puskar, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Hue Jackson didn't lose his nerve.\n\nFired this week by the Browns after winning just three of 40 games in two plus-seasons, Jackson on Friday disputed owner Jimmy Haslam's assertion there was \"internal discord\" on the coaching staff that made his dismissal \u2014 along with offensive coordinator Todd Haley's \u2014 necessary.\n\nDays after being let go, Jackson appeared on ESPN to defend his record, describe regrets and essentially audition for another job.\n\nOn Monday, Haslam, who has fired four coaches in six years, intimated that in-fighting between Jackson and Haley were at the root of his decision to make a change halfway through the season.\n\nJackson disagreed with his former boss and said he wanted to \"set the record straight.\"\n\n\"I don't really think it was truly just about internal discord,\" said Jackson, who went 1-15, 0-15 and 2-5-1 with Cleveland. \"I think that's a strong word. I think you have disagreements with coaches \u2014 with Todd, with (defensive coordinator) Gregg Williams, with Amos Jones, who is also the special teams coordinator. I don't think that's internal discord. I think when you look at it, the organization made a decision to go in a different direction.\"\n\nJackson knows he didn't win nearly enough, and he has some misgiving about the way he handled things. Following a recent loss to Tampa Bay, a frustrated Jackson said he intended to \"dive in\" and help Haley. Jackson said he was only trying to help, but the comments widened a rift with Haley and sent a shockwave through the team's front office.\n\nJackson feels that ultimately the decision to let him go was to protect rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield, who may finally end the franchise's search for a long-term QB.\n\n\"I think when you really stop to look at it, it's truly really about Baker Mayfield,\" Jackson said. \"I think they want to do everything they can to put him in a situation. You got the first pick of the draft, who I think is going to be a franchise quarterback who is going to be a sensational player, and he's not playing as well. So again, here is a perfect storm to move forward and move on. And I have to respect the decision that they made.\"\n\nJackson said he was the one who hired Haley, who spent the previous six seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Jackson didn't want to relinquish play-calling duties \u2014 he was also Cleveland's offensive coordinator in his first two seasons \u2014 but he felt it would be better if he got help.\n\nJackson now admits he should have never \"given away the offense.\"\n\n\"I knew that Todd Haley was a proven offensive play-caller, veteran play-caller in our division. Why would you not?\" Jackson said of Haley's hiring. \"I mean, let's be honest, I knew I was on the clock. You can't be 1-15, 0-16 and think, you know you can go through the season and not win football games. I wanted to surround myself with guys that have done it, and done it at a high level, and Todd Haley was definitely one of those guys.\"\n\nJackson said he felt it was important to go public with his feelings just days after being fired.\n\n\"I want people to understand \u2014 I'm human just like anybody else,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, I didn't do enough. We didn't do enough to get the job done in Cleveland. So what am I supposed to do? I'm not going to go crawl into a hole and say pull the covers.\"\n\nJackson knows his 11-44-1 record as a head coach doesn't make him attractive to lead a team.\n\n\"I hope the next opportunity for me is to go back and be a coordinator first and foremost,\" he said. \"Go back and put my name back to where it should be, among some of the best play callers in this league.

(Jerry Larson/Waco Tribune Herald, via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) \u2014 A broad smile creeps across Mississippi State coach Vic Schaefer's face when he talks about having one more season with his \"Aircraft Carrier.\"\n\nIt's one of his affectionate nicknames for 6-foot-7 senior Teaira McCowan. She is part of a trifecta of players who represent a rarity in basketball, whether in the NBA or the men's and women's college games: A traditional center that can dominate a game playing with their back to the basket.\n\nBaylor's Kalani Brown and Iowa's Megan Gustafson round out the trio.\n\nMcCowan's imposing height and wingspan helped carry the Bulldogs to back-to-back appearances in the NCAA Tournament national championship game the past two seasons. She was an All-American last year after averaging 18.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and more than two blocks a contest.\n\n\"You put her on the low block, there's not anyone better in the country,\" Schaefer said. \"I think for us and what we do offensively, she's an absolutely perfect fit.\"\n\nThe sport is moving toward versatile post players who have perimeter skills that include shooting 3-pointers. McCowan, Brown and Gustafson are showing there is still a place in the game for old-school centers.\n\n\"It's a luxury,\" Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. \"There's just not very many of them anymore.\"\n\nAnd it's not a coincidence that the Bears, Bulldogs and Hawkeyes enter the season with high expectations. Baylor is ranked No. 4 in the preseason rankings while Mississippi State is No. 6 and Iowa is No. 13.\n\nSchaefer and Bluder say there are many reasons why traditional centers aren't very prevalent anymore. They say it's simply hard to find a good 6-6 athlete who enjoys physical contact and will put in the time to learn the footwork and technical skills needed to play on the block.\n\n\"Sometimes it's slow and tedious,\" Schaefer said. \"Teaira played 10 minutes a game her freshman year, then as a sophomore she's sixth player of the year. Her third year, she goes from not being on the All-SEC team to being an All-American.\n\n\"That doesn't happen often. She bypassed a lot of steps between her sophomore and junior years.\"\n\nMcCowan said being so tall comes with challenges that guards might not have. Once she figured things out, the payoff was huge.\n\n\"I think me just getting comfortable in my own body helped,\" McCowan said. \"Then it was just listening to my coaches, them giving me moves and information on what to do and it made things come along.\"\n\nBrown and Gustafson have had career trajectories that look a lot like McCowan's. The 6-7 Brown went from starting just one game her freshman year to averaging 20.1 points and 10.2 rebounds while shooting 65 percent from the field as a junior.\n\nBrown said she understands the appeal of having tall players become more versatile and play on the perimeter, but there's a fine line where suddenly posts aren't using their strengths.\n\nThe trio of McCowan, Brown and Gustafson certainly stick to what works. The three have combined for 3,042 shots in their careers and have just one 3-point attempt between them.\n\n\"There's not many of us,\" Brown said. \"Sixth, seventh, eighth graders \u2014 I see a lot of (younger) big girls dribbling early or even dunking. But I still think we should do what we do best.\"\n\nGustafson went from averaging 10.7 points during her freshman year to 25.2 points, 12.8 rebounds and more than two blocks per game last season as a junior. At 6-foot-3, she doesn't have the same imposing height of McCowan and Brown, but uses quickness to dominate in the Big Ten.\n\n\"I love playing against girls who are as tall or taller than me, so I can really use my agility and speed,\" Gustafson said.\n\nGustafson said she's worked on adding an outside shot, but like the others, she knows \"what my strengths are.\" One of those includes adding a hook shot to her game, which she learned partially by watching old videos of former NBA great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nBluder said it's that kind of dedication to perfecting her craft that makes Gustafson so valuable. In a game that's moving toward inside-outside post players, the coach said there will always be room on the floor for a true center.\n\n\"When you find one,\" Bluder said. \"It's a hidden jewel.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Basketball Writer Doug Feinberg contributed to this story.

Realmuto says his client has informed the Miami Marlins he won\u2019t sign a long-term contract, increasing the likelihood the team will trade yet another All-Star. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Miami Marlins president of baseball operations Michael Hill dismissed talk about trading J.T. Realmuto with a joke Friday, noting the All-Star catcher may well be in a new uniform next year because there are rumors about the team changing its logo.\n\nRealmuto's agent, Jeff Berry, predicted this week that his client will be with a different team by spring training.\n\n\"Agents can say whatever they want to say,\" Hill said. \"J.T. knows how we feel about him.\"\n\nBut Hill declined to say whether Realmuto informed the Marlins he won't sign a long-term contract with them, as Berry said.\n\n\"Any conversations we have with our players are going to stay in house,\" Hill said.\n\nAnd Hill acknowledged the possibility of tempting trade offers, with some likely to come during next week's general manager meetings in Carlsbad, California.\n\n\"J.T. is obviously a very talented player,\" Hill said. \"I would expect there will be interest in a lot of our talented players.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives.\n\nThe first time I hosted Thanksgiving dinner, I was a wreck. You would think that years of working in restaurant kitchens would have prepared me for the big day, but it really hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have anything I needed and I resorted to barking out orders to my family members as if they were line cooks in my restaurant. Not exactly the way I wanted to spend my day off! After the chaos had dissipated, I reflected on the day to see what went wrong. It all came down to my cooking tools, and I didn't have what I needed to get the job done.\n\nIn addition to the intangible things (like making a to-do list, doing prep work in advance, and clearing out room in the refrigerator for all the turkey-day food), there are a few equipment necessities that will make your Thanksgiving Day go that much smoother. And, since we try not to recommend any unitasker tools that are only useful once a year, we tested 121 products (and researched countless more), to make sure you can put this stuff to good use all year long.\n\nHere are the best Thanksgiving tools that we've tested here at Reviewed (many are our Editor's Choice winners!). I've also added a few of my personal favorites, too.\n\nFor the turkey\n\nEveryone knows the turkey is the star of the show, and these tools will help you prepare the perfect bird! From cooking it to carving it, we tested all the essential equipment you'll need to make this iconic Thanksgiving main dish.\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018 (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n1. The Viking 3-ply roasting pan w/non-stick rack\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Viking roasting pan (Photo: Reviewed/Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nMost people think of a roasting pan as a Thanksgiving essential, and it definitely is: Talk about a fuss-free way to cook up a turkey! But, you can also use a well-built one year-round for sheet pan meals or cooking a roast for a crowd, making it worth it to invest in a good one. The tri-ply stainless steel construction definitely gives it some heft, but the handles are super wide and comfortable, distributing the pan's weight nicely. It had excellent heat distribution as well. It's big and sturdy enough to handle a 20-pound turkey and it's capable of cooking anything you throw at it, making it our top roasting pan and one of our Editors' Choice products.\n\nGet the Viking 3-ply roasting pan on Amazon for $149.95\n\n2. The ThermoWorks ChefAlarm probe thermometer\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: ThermoWorks ChefAlarm (Photo: Reviewed/Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nDon't undercook your turkey! Confidently toss it into the oven and forget about it until it beeps by probing it with our top-performing probe thermometer. In addition to being the most accurate probe we tested, it also has a nice backlight display. You can use it as a timer, adjust the alarm's volume, or use it to keep track of the minimum and maximum readings. We especially love its hinged tilting screen for easy viewing on the countertop, but it also has a magnet and a clip if that works better for your kitchen. Spending $60 on a thermometer might not be for everyone, but, this model is well worth the price tag, not only for your Thanksgiving Day meal but also if you're serious about barbecue, making cheese, or boiling sugar for candy.\n\nGet the ThermoWorks ChefAlarm probe thermometer at ThermoWorks for $64\n\n3. The ThermoWorks ThermoPop digital thermometer\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: ThermoWorks ThermoPop (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf monitoring your turkey's temperature from inside the oven isn't important to you, pick up our top-ranked digital thermometer, the ThermoPop instead. It immediately impressed us with its super quick, accurate readings and its beautiful appearance. The probe is long enough to keep your hands safely away from any hot steam. It also features a super thin tip that didn\u2019t allow for many poultry juices to escape after probing. With a click of a super soft button, the display rotates 360 degrees for ease of viewing. Another click and the backlight illuminates the large numbers.\n\nGet the ThermoWorks ThermoPop digital thermometer at ThermoWorks for $34\n\n4. The OXO Good Grips Good Gravy Fat Separator\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: OXO Fat Separator (Photo: Reviewed/Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nFat separators might not be the sexiest gadget in the kitchen, but you'll need one if you're hoping to make a killer gravy this year. By design, bottom-draining separators make it almost impossible to pass a lot of fatty-liquid through their valves because the fat floats on the top. Some of them have temperamental levers, but the trigger on our top fat separator and Editors' Choice winner in the OXO fat separator is super easy to control and by design will minimize splashing, creating less mess than some of the other models we tested. There's also a pour spout on the top, which makes it much easier to remove the fat left behind. And, since the lever mechanism is located on the outside of the separator, we had no problems when it came time to clean everything up.\n\nGet the OXO Good Grips Gravy Fat Separator on Amazon for $23.50\n\n5. The J.A. Henckels International Poultry Shears\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: J.A. Henckels Poultry Shears (Photo: J.A. Henckels)\n\nIf you prefer preparing a spatchcocked turkeys, you\u2019ll need a good pair of poultry shears. It's easy enough, but you do need to cut out the backbone (which, as the name implies, is lined with a bunch of bones that'll destroy your expensive knives). I love my J.A. Henckels set because they\u2019re easy to handle and their super-sharp blade cuts through tough turkey bones like they\u2019re butter. They're easy enough to sharpen when they get dull and they lock for safe, easy storage. It\u2019s always nice when you don\u2019t cut your hand digging through your gadget drawer!\n\nGet the J.A. Henckels International Poultry Shears on Amazon for $19.95\n\n6. The Mercer Culinary Renaissance 11\" Granton Edge Slicing Knife\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Mercer knife (Photo: Mercer)\n\nThis carving knife came in my culinary school knife kit, and it\u2019s so sharp I\u2019ve never had reason to replace it! After you\u2019ve spent all that time and money to prepare your turkey, you definitely want to present it just right. You could use your Chef\u2019s knife, but there\u2019s something ceremonious about pulling out a good carving knife. Plus, since you don\u2019t use it as frequently, chances are good it\u2019s razor-sharp when you need it. You\u2019ll quickly and easily be able to carve up your turkey and present perfect slices.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t come as a set, but you can also pick up the matching carving fork (available at Amazon). I usually use a set of kitchen tongs, but the fork certainly looks nicer and gives you better control.\n\nGet the Mercer Slicing Knife on Amazon for $27.99\n\n7. The Black & Decker EK500B electric knife\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Black & Decker Electric Knife (Photo: Reviewed/Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nThere are two stand-out factors that make the Black and Decker EK500B 9-Inch Electric Carving Knife our favorite electric knife and an Editors' Choice winner. First, it aced all of our performance tests, but that's not what impressed us the most. The Black and Decker also has the most comfortable handle and was the quietest knife we tested. The round handle fit perfectly in our hands and stayed put, even when our hands were covered in chicken grease. The knife created little to no vibrations, making it easy to keep our finger locked onto the trigger without slipping. Since the Black and Decker is regularly priced at under $20, it also happens to be the best value, too. I would happily use this knife regularly to slice homemade bread or quickly break down a roast, but that price makes it attractive even if you only pull it out on the holidays.\n\nGet the Black & Decker EK500B electric knife on Amazon for $17.65\n\n8. The Teakhaus Rectangle Carving Board With Hand Grips\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Teakhaus cutting board (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWhen we tested cutting boards, we split the winners into three categories. Our favorite bamboo cutting board was great for any task in the kitchen, but the Teakhaus' size and heft made it more of a specialty board than a catch-all winner. It happens to be perfect for resting and carving a Thanksgiving turkey, though, because it can easily hold a 25-pound bird! It also happens to be a gorgeous piece that makes a stylish addition to your kitchen counter. The use of teak (a high-oil wood) fought off moisture better than the other wooden boards and it held the largest amount of liquid (2/3 cup) in its groves before spilling over.\n\nGet the Teakhaus cutting board on Amazon for $98.95\n\nTo Make Great Side Dishes\n\nSometimes, I swear I like the side dishes more than the turkey itself. I know, I know, blasphemy! But these gadgets will help your mashed potatoes, vegetables, and casseroles turn out as delicious as the turkey!\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018 (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n1. The Chef'n FreshForce Potato Ricer\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Potato Ricer (Photo: Reviewed/Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm serious about my mashed potatoes. It's my favorite side on the Thanksgiving table! And a potato rice is the gadget you need to make fluffy, airy mashed potatoes. We loved the way our top potato ricer and Editors' Choice winner effortlessly pushed the potatoes through the hopper, thanks to a gear-powered mechanism that requires less arm strength to use. It was the only ricer we tested that we could use one-handed with a whole potato (with the others we tested, we had to chop the potatoes up into small pieces to achieve one-handed pressing). The comfortable handle is made from a heavy-duty plastic, but the hopper itself is stainless steel, which is easier to clean and should last a long time. The simple two-construction design allows you to take the stainless steel basket out, making it both easy to fill and a breeze to clean.\n\nGet the Chef'n FreshForce Potato Ricer on Amazon for $30.19\n\n2. The Cuisinart Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls with Lids\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Cusinart mixing bowls (Photo: Reviewed/Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nIf you ask me which I prefer (glass or stainless steel bowls), I'll say stainless every time. There\u2019s nothing to shatter or chip, making them both durable and long-lasting, and their lightweight profile makes them easy to use. While they shouldn\u2019t go into the microwave, they can be used on the stovetop as a double boiler\u2013and the small- and medium-sized bowls in the Cuisinart Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls with Lids worked perfectly for melting butter and chocolate over a 2-quart saucepan. As a bonus, the bowls come with air-tight plastic lids, so each bowl doubles as storage and transportation container (always helpful when you're planning a large meal). They were our top choice for mixing bowls and an Editors' Choice winner.\n\nGet the Cuisinart Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls with Lids on Amazon for $25.99\n\n3. The Pyrex Easy Grab Bake 'N Store glass baking dishes\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Pyrex dishes (Photo: Pyrex)\n\nThe best part about making casseroles for Thanksgiving? You can make them ahead of time and reheat them when it\u2019s time to serve the big meal! That means less scrambling on Thanksgiving Day (which, hopefully, gives you more time to mingle with your guests). These Pyrex casserole dishes certainly aren\u2019t fancy to look at, but I\u2019ve been using my set for years. They heat evenly, they're easy to clean, and those snap-on lids to make food storage a breeze.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a more presentation-worthy dish, pick up a Le Creuset Stoneware Rectangular Dish (Available at Amazon for $74.95). It looks great when you want to go from oven to table, and it can also be put under the broiler (the one thing the Pyrex can't do).\n\nGet the Pyrex Easy Grab Bake 'N Store glass baking dishes on Amazon for $17.80\n\n4. The Cuisinart DFP-14BCNY food processor\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Cuisinart food processor (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you don't feel like cutting anything this year, hook up our top-ranked food processor which is also an Editors' Choice winner instead. You can chop onions, celery, and garlic for stuffing and use the included attachment to slice potatoes or shred cheese. In fact, you can even make your pie crust in it! In our testing, the Cuisinart \"Custom 14\" food processor (model DFP\u201114BCNY) is the best on the market. It excels at almost every task, from chopping onions and slicing tomatoes as well as a razor-sharp chefs' knife, to kneading pizza dough into a smooth elastic ball. As an added bonus, the Cuisinart is so quiet while it's running that it won\u2019t shut down conversation in the kitchen! Cleanup is a cinch, as Cuisinart is the only manufacturer that actually encourages you to wash the parts in the dishwasher.\n\nGet the Cusinart food processor on Amazon for $158.96\n\n5. The Lodge 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Lodge pans (Photo: Lodge)\n\nI don't know about you, but I love my cast iron skillet! Some years, I skip the casserole dishes entirely and make my mac and cheese, stuffing, or cornbread straight in the cast iron. Lodge has been making its cast iron cookware since 1896, but its durability is one reason why Lodge has become a household name\u2014and why they make our top-ranked cast iron pan and one of our Editors' Choice winners. The Lodge Logic 12-inch skillet sells for just under $20 on sale, but it's likely to last for generations. Our only complaint? It comes with no written warranty, though Lodge claims it will always stand behind its products.\n\nGet the Lodge 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skillet on Amazon for $22.25\n\nGeneral Cooking Must-Haves\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Cuisinart cookware (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWhether you're setting up your first kitchen or you're looking to make some upgrades, these cookware essentials will definitely come in handy on Thanksgiving Day. These staples can be used with multiple courses and make a great addition to your kitchen.\n\n1. The Cuisinart MCP-12N Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Cuisinart cookware (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nYou'll need pots and pans to prepare all your favorite sauces and side dishes, so consider it a great excuse to upgrade your cookware set. The Cuisinart MCP-12N Multiclad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set is regularly on sale for just above $200, and you should definitely snatch one up if you see it hovering around that price. We love how easy thee pans are to use and they earned an Editors' Choice award and the top spot in our reviews of cookware sets. The tri-ply construction gives the pans the benefit of heat conductivity, but the aluminum core ensures they\u2019re not too heavy to handle. The set includes everything you need to cook a meal: two saucepans (1 1/2- and 3-quart), an 8-quart stockpot, a medium-sized 3.5-quart saut\u00e9 pan, two skillets (8- and 10-inch), and a steamer insert\u2014all with comfortable handles and a design that creates a nice balance when holding the pan.\n\nGet the Cuisinart Stainless Steel Cookware Set on Amazon for $188.13\n\n2. The Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet Classic 18-pc Knife Block Set\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Zwilling knife set (Photo: Reviewed/Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nYou don't need every knife in the block to prepare Thanksgiving dinner, but this set gives you everything you'll need at a great value\u2014especially considering that it comes with eight really nice steak knives and a killer set of kitchen shears. The chef\u2019s knife (the one you'll probably use most often) is lightweight and easy to wield while also being one of the sharper knives in our test group of the best knife sets. The paring knife fits perfectly in our hands for off-the-cutting-board activities like peeling apples, and the serrated bread knife made quick work at slicing crusty baguettes as the whole set earned an Editors' Choice award.\n\nGet the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Knife Set on amazon for $279.95\n\n3. The Nordic Ware Natural Aluminum Commercial Baker's Half Sheet\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Nordic Ware baking sheets (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nPlanning on making cookies for Thanksgiving? Roasted vegetables? Tossing out your roasting pan in lieu of a spatchcocked turkey? You'll need a good baking sheet, and there\u2019s a reason this American-made baking sheet tops charts around the internet, including an Editors' Choice award and our list of the best baking sheets. It\u2019s lightweight, large enough to fit more than a dozen cookies, and distributes heat like a dream. Measuring 12 by 17 inches, we feel confident you could cook enough vegetables for a small crowd. Like all baking sheets, the biggest concern is always cleaning. We'd recommend using parchment paper or a Silpat mat under my cookies to ensure that nothing sticks. For meats and vegetables, you could also line the sheet with aluminum foil.\n\nGet the Nordic Ware Natural Aluminum Commercial Baker's Half sheet on Amazon from multiple sellers\n\n4. The Checkered Chef Half-Sheet Stainless Steel Cooling Rack\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Cooling rack (Photo: Amazon)\n\nWire racks aren\u2019t just for cooling your cookies and cakes: Use one to line a baking sheet and you'll create the perfect convection cooking space. You see, the air will be able to circulate underneath your food, creating the crispiest bacon or Brussels sprouts on the block. You can also use it to cook a spatchcocked turkey. How could you say no to a method that creates perfectly crispy skin on 100 percent of your turkey? I can't!\n\nGet the Checkered Chef Cooling Rack on Amazon for $10.97\n\nFor Delicious Desserts\n\nI'm not sure you can call it Thanksgiving if you don't finish the meal with pie!

The Emile Henry Modern Classics Pie Dish\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Emile Henry pie dish (Photo: Emile Henry)\n\nIt's almost a Thanksgiving requirement to serve pie, so why not do it in style? You can't beat the Emile Henry Pie Dish for looks or turning out a pie with a crispy, flaky crust. It\u2019s made in France of ceramic and comes in lots of pretty colors. While this 9-by-2 inch dish is deep enough to hold almost two quarts of filling, we didn\u2019t find our pies came out skimpy looking. Its large capacity and attractive appearance make it a good choice for baking and serving other items like scalloped potatoes or candied sweets. As it can withstand high temperatures, you can run the Emile under the broiler if you want to brown off a lemon meringue pie or a mac and cheese casserole. Plus, it\u2019s microwave and dishwasher safe, making it an Editors' Choice winner and our best pie dish.\n\nGet the Emile Henry Modern Classics Pie Dish on Amazon For $29.99\n\n2. The J.K. Adams Plain Maple Rolling Dowel\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: J.K. Adams rolling pin (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWhen they say there\u2019s beauty in simplicity, they\u2019re talking about this rolling pin. It\u2019s really just a sturdy wooden cylinder of a medium-heavy weight, nothing more, nothing less. But during testing, it rolled out perfect dough every time to win an Editors' Choice award and be named our top-ranked rolling pin. The simple design of this rolling pin, combined with its weight, makes it easy to control the amount of pressure you use based on what you need for your dough. Its long body and lack of handles also mean that you'll never cut an edge through your dough the way you sometimes might with smaller, handled rolling pins. This translates to an even, non-lumpy dough that's easy to shape however you want. Flour sticks to the pin just fine, which keeps dough from sticking while in use. The pin also cleans up easily. The only downside is that, depending on the size of your kitchen, it might be tough to put this beauty away. Its 19-inch length simply makes it harder to tuck into a drawer.\n\nGet the J.K. Adams Plain Maple Rolling Dowell on Amazon from multiple sellers\n\nDon't Forget the Leftovers (and Cleanup)!\n\nEvery year, I forget about storing the leftovers! You can totally make it work with aluminum foil and plastic wrap, but this is a better option. And once you've tucked those away, we have a few suggestions for a better cleanup.\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Cleanup (Photo: Getty Images)\n\n1. The Glasslock 18-Piece Assorted Oven Safe Container Set\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Glasslock containers (Photo: Reviewed)\n\nA really nice set of reusable containers should be ready during dinner cleanup. We love that these containers nest within each other for easy storage, they don't impart off-flavors into our food, and they're marked as dishwasher-, microwave-, and oven-safe (just the glass, not the lids). It also doesn't hurt that they aced every test we could think of. They didn't leak water when we sloshed them around and didn't burst open or shatter when we dropped them from a countertop. When we froze them, expanding food didn't break through the seal and they resisted stains. They were our top-ranked containers and won an Editors' Choice award for it.\n\nGet the Glasslock 18-Piece Assorted Oven Safe Container Set on Amazon for $54.99\n\n2. The Williams Sonoma All-Purpose Pantry Towels\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: Williams Sonoma dish towels (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWashing the Thanksgiving dishes can be a daunting task, but the classic pantry towels from Williams Sonoma can help you get the job done without any fuss. That's why they earned an Editors' Choice award and were named our best dish towels too. Not only do these towels look good in any kitchen (choose from six colors), but they're a pro at drying irregular objects like wine glasses and vases while still feeling soft to the touch. Made from ribbon cotton terry, the towels retain more water than its competitors, which means it should be able to wipe water from plenty of dishes before you need to grab another one.\n\nGet the Williams Sonoma All-Purpose Pantry Towels from Williams Sonoma for $19.95\n\n3. The PremiumRacks Professional Dish Rack\n\nThe best Thanksgiving tools of 2018: PremiumRack dish rack (Photo: Reviewed/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to run your good china, crystal, and silver through the dishwasher (or you don\u2019t have a dishwasher), a good dish rack is essential for an organized post-Thanksgiving dinner cleanup. Our top-ranked rack and Editors' Choice winner is this PremiumRacks Professional, a smartly designed double-decker that holds more dishes than others we tested, without leaving a very large countertop footprint. The bottom portion is your standard featureless rack, but the top holds plates more securely than most of the racks we tested. A cutlery basket hooks onto the side, as does a second basket that can be topped with a lid specifically designed for sharp knives. There\u2019s even a special attachment to dry your cutting boards. The rack also comes with two drain board options\u2014one meant to let water pool, and the other designed to tip any water into the sink\u2014plus a microfiber cloth to set underneath.\n\nGet the Premium Racks Professional Dish Rack on Amazon for $59.99\n\nPrices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.\n\nFor more kitchen cleanup favorites, including paper towels, sponges and trash cans, check out our guide, The Best Kitchen Essentials.\n\nThis story also appeared on Reviewed, where the product experts have you covered for Thanksgiving and much, much more.

This thing\u2019s getting pretty interesting, this thing\u2019s getting pretty exciting.\u2019 Just because you think something might make the sport better doesn\u2019t mean it will, but Alabama winning again this year will not be good for college football.\u201d\n\nTua fires another touchdown, but takes a hit in the process. pic.twitter.com/au8WdcYuYN \u2014 SEConCBS (@SEConCBS) October 20, 2018\n\nComing off a bye week with the No. 1 offense in the country led by quarterback and Heisman Trophy favorite Tua Tagovailoa, the season\u2019s narrative has revolved around Nick Saban\u2019s team being the best, by far, and everyone else is an afterthought.\n\n\u201cAlabama has sucked some of the oxygen out of college football this year,\u201d Finebaum continued.\n\nThat said, the analyst still thinks the Crimson Tide will remain undefeated after this weekend, although the LSU game is just the beginning of the most challenging part of the team\u2019s season.\n\nAfter Saturday, it faces Mississippi State, The Citadel and Auburn, and it will most likely take on Georgia in the SEC championship game, he predicted. To get to the conference title game, the Bulldogs have to win Saturday against Kentucky.\n\nBut no team has challenged Alabama so far this season outside of Texas A&M, which still lost by 22 points in Week 5.\n\n\u201cThe X factor here is the unknown because of Alabama\u2019s schedule, which I think we can all agree has been pretty bad,\u201d Finebaum said looking at the LSU game and citing a 2-6 Louisville team as the Crimson Tide\u2019s best nonconference opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just a matter of whether Tua can handle the moment tomorrow night. Can he deal with the unknown? I think he can, but we don\u2019t have anything to back that up.\n\n\u201cThe counter argument would be, \u2018Well, he did it in the national championship game (last season),\u2019 but the circumstances were different. He came off the bench, Alabama was in a desperate situation. Yeah, he threw a walk-off winner, but it\u2019s a little different being the starter, having the pressure and then trying to deal with adversity if something goes wrong.\u201d\n\nThinking about rolling up to #SECNation in this thing tomorrow.

There\u2019s the possibility that a wild crowd combined with LSU\u2019s defense \u2014 which is tied for No. 1 in the country in interceptions (14) \u2014 could be enough to catch Tagovailoa and the Crimson Tide off-balance.\n\nThat\u2019s the Tigers\u2019 best chance for an upset as two-touchdown underdogs, Finebaum explained.\n\n\u201cLSU can win this game if Alabama comes out and turns the ball over, maybe for a touchdown, maybe gets rattled,\u201d he said. \u201cHeaven forbid \u2014 and I say this on both sides \u2014 an injury at the quarterback position. I think that is the danger for Alabama because Jalen Hurts, who would normally be the best backup in America, he\u2019s hurt too. \u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the nervous factor. Having been to LSU many, many times, if you find yourself behind and you\u2019re out of rhythm and things are going haywire, that place becomes much more difficult. For all the conversation about Tiger Stadium on Saturday night, if you\u2019re leading, it\u2019s not that big a deal.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re behind and you\u2019re out of sorts, it can be like a horror chamber.\u201d", "FILE -In this Sept. 9, 2018, file photo, Minnesota Vikings' Dalvin Cook (33) carries the ball during an NFL football game against the the San Francisco 49ers in Minneapolis. Cook's hamstring wasn't healing fast enough so the Minnesota Vikings gave him a full week to rest last week and held him out for the fifth time in six games. (AP Photo/Craig Lassig, FIle) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Since the Minnesota Vikings made him their top draft pick last year, Dalvin Cook has played in only seven of a possible 24 regular-season games.\n\nThat means the early lessons have been just as much about handling injuries and making the most of the inaction as they've been about picking up the playbook and adjusting to NFL speed.\n\n\"I've just been gaining knowledge from my teammates, all the older guys,\" Cook said. \"The guys in my room have just been pushing me through it. I've been learning through this whole process, and I'm just trying to become a better player and better person.\n\n\"That's what I've been getting from the whole experience, and it's nothing negative. Yeah, I've been injured and banged up, but I'm just learning through the whole experience. Once I get back, it's going to be on.\"\n\nThat's the kind of attitude that pushed him through the grueling rehab after a torn ACL in his left knee, suffered in the fourth game of his rookie season against Detroit. He stayed ahead of schedule and was ready in time for the opener this year, contributing 95 total yards in his first performance under new offensive coordinator John DeFilippo, who eagerly sought to maximize the versatile and elusive Cook's impact as a ball carrier and a pass-catcher as soon as he was hired last winter.\n\nThis fall has, by some measures, been more frustrating because of the seemingly minor hamstring injury Cook experienced on a hot afternoon in Green Bay on Sept. 16. He was ruled out of the following game, listed as questionable to play at Los Angeles on Sept. 27 and lined up at tailback in a limited role that night. Cook was deemed questionable again to play at Philadelphia on Oct. 7 and against Arizona on Oct. 14, but he ultimately watched both of those games from the sideline, too.\n\nThen the Vikings decided enough was enough and kept him off the practice field for two full weeks. After sitting out against New Orleans, his fifth absence in the last six games, Cook returned to practice as a limited participant on Wednesday. He said he never had a setback. The injury simply didn't fully subside.\n\n\"With these things, if you kind of keep stepping on them and keep doing what you're doing, they're just going to keep lingering along,\" Cook said. \"You've got to kind of shut the body down. That's why I'm so confident in our medical staff, because they've got the right plan set up for me. We've been going by what my body has for me daily. My body's been reacting to it good, so it was very important.\"\n\nCook was listed as questionable for the game against Detroit on Sunday when this week's injury report was announced after practice on Friday. With the bye week coming next, the Vikings could always play it safe and give him even more time to heal. Coach Mike Zimmer downplayed the significance of the bye in the decision.\n\n\"If guys can play, they play,\" Zimmer said. \"That's just how we do it around here.\"\n\nNo matter how many times Cook has tested the hamstring, there's no telling whether it's back to normal until that first carry.\n\n\"You can practice. You can run around. You can run straight. You can do all that,\" Cook said. \"But it's about going out there and the person chasing you and you turning your body and you twisting your body and having the twitch to do it. That's when hamstrings occur.\"\n\nOther players listed as questionable for Sunday were wide receiver Stefon Diggs (rib), left tackle Riley Reiff (foot), cornerback Xavier Rhodes (foot) and strong safety Andrew Sendejo (groin). Linebacker Anthony Barr (hamstring), left guard Tom Compton (knee) and backup running back Roc Thomas (hamstring) were ruled out.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Justice Department sued to block that deal over concerns that AT&T would gain too much control over how Americans will be able to watch Time Warner content and on what platforms it could do so.\n\nThe Department is currently appealing AT&T's victory, saying that the ruling in AT&T's favor was found only by \"erroneously ignoring fundamental principles of economics and common sense.\u201d\n\nAT&T, however, accuses Dish and the DOJ of working together, even extending it to this latest HBO dispute.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice collaborated closely with Dish in its unsuccessful lawsuit to block our merger,\" Cocozza said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. \"That collaboration continues to this day with Dish\u2019s tactical decision to drop HBO \u2013 not the other way around. DOJ failed to prove its claims about HBO at trial and then abandoned them on appeal.\u201d\n\nDish is hoping to go to arbitration with AT&T, with HBO and Cinemax access being restored while the companies settle their differences. AT&T, of course, is recommending people on Twitter to go to its \"Keep My HBO\" website to find other ways to get the channels.\n\nTo our Dish customers: We\u2019re committed to giving you the choices you deserve.

Baldwin didn't comment as he walked past reporters and photographers after he was released from police custody. (Nov. 2) AP\n\nAlec Baldwin has gotten in trouble, yet again. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall, AP)\n\nAlec Baldwin can't seem to control his temper.\n\nOver the years, the actor has become well known for both his comic chops and volatile behavior. On Friday, he showed his hotheaded side yet again when he was arrested for punching a man in the face in New York City, allegedly following a dispute over a parking spot.\n\nHere's a look at Baldwin's most notable moments that have earned him his not-so-stellar reputation.\n\nThe 1995 cameraman punch\n\nIn October 1995, Alec Baldwin was placed under citizen's arrest after allegedly punching a photographer in the nose, according to the Los Angeles Times. Baldwin said at the time he was trying to protect his then-newborn daughter Ireland from paparazzi.\n\nIn a statement shared with the newspaper, Baldwin said, \"Anyone with a shred of human decency would understand that there are times in your life when you want your privacy respected ... I do believe that bringing your wife and 3-day-old baby home from the hospital is one of those occasions.\" He continued: \"I'm sorry for any problems caused and I look forward to (the photographer) Mr. Zanger and I putting this behind us.\"\n\nThe incident was the first of several run-ins Baldwin had with photographers. He has since shoved and/or screamed at photographers he felt were too close to him and his family, in 2012, 2013 (detailed below) and 2016.\n\nThe 2007 \u201cpig\u201d voicemail\n\nIn April 2007, Baldwin was heard on a voicemail firing insults at ex-wife Kim Basinger, and calling their then-11-year-old daughter Ireland a \u201crude, thoughtless little pig.\u201d\n\nThe actor apologized for the message and Ireland took it as a reaction to her dad's frustration over his custody battle with her mother.\n\nEight years later, Baldwin was able to joke about the incident with Ireland, who posted a photo of the two of them reading a book called \u201cIf I Were a Pig ... \u201c\n\nThe 2011 \u201cWords With Friends\u201d incident\n\nIn December 2011, Baldwin was booted from an American Airlines flight after he caused a scene when he refused to stop playing the Scrabble-style game \"Words with Friends.\"\n\nAccording to a Facebook post by the airline, Baldwin acted aggressively when asked to turn off his phone on board. The airline said he was kicked off the flight after he \u201cslammed the lavatory door so hard, the cockpit crew heard it and became alarmed\u201d and he \u201cwas extremely rude to the crew, calling them inappropriate names and using offensive language.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was never my intention to inconvenience anyone with my \u2018issue\u2019 with a certain flight attendant,\u201d Baldwin later wrote in a piece published by the Huffington Post. \u201cThe lesson I've learned is to keep my phone off when the 1950s gym teacher is on duty.\u201d\n\nThe 2013 \"toxic little queen\" tweets\n\nIn June 2013, the \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" star took to Twitter to defend his wife, Hilaria, who was accused of tweeting during James Gandolfini's funeral.\n\n\u201cSomeone wrote that my wife was tweeting at a funeral. Hey. That\u2019s not true. But I\u2019m gonna tweet at your funeral ... you toxic little queen,\u201d Baldwin wrote in an expletive-laden rant directed at MailOnline writer George Clark. Clark had earlier commented on the fact the Hilaria's Twitter account was sharing upbeat posts while mourners were at church.\n\nIt was just one of Baldwin's many Twitter rants. The star has deactivated his account several times over the years, but he always comes back for more.\n\nThe 2013 anti-gay slur\n\nIn November 2013, Baldwin was caught on tape yelling a homophobic slur at a photographer.\n\nThough Baldwin apologized on Twitter and maintained that he never delivered a universally derided epithet, Anderson Cooper wasn\u2019t convinced Baldwin was sorry: \"Just read Alec Baldwin's latest excuses. They are actually so ridiculous they are funny,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAt the time of the incident, Baldwin had an MSNBC show called \u201cUp Late With Alec Baldwin.\u201d It was pulled off the air for two weeks. Later, MSNBC canceled the show entirely.\n\nBaldwin wrote in another Huffington Post editorial: \u201cTwo requests. Don\u2019t allow my problem to be MSNBC\u2019s problem. They are good people who work hard at a job, just like many of you. And two, please respect the privacy of my wife and family.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 case of bad biking\n\nIn May 2014, Baldwin was arrested for riding his bicycle the wrong way on Fifth Avenue.\n\nBaldwin didn\u2019t have his ID with him when he was riding, so he was issued two criminal summonses: one for the traffic offense and one for disorderly conduct. That\u2019s when the President Trump impersonator \u201cbecame belligerent\u201d with the officers, according to the police report.\n\nAfter the incident, Baldwin tweeted that New York City is \u201ca mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.\u201d\n\nMore: Alec Baldwin arrested in New York after punching a man in a parking dispute\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/02/alec-baldwin-arrest-temper-voicemail-flight-bike/1860480002/", "Arizona State wide receiver N'Keal Harry (1) returns a punt for a touchdown against Southern California during the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 That 0-2 start to the Pac-12 season seems like ancient history to Utah now.\n\nThe No. 16 Utes (6-2, 4-2 Pac-12) have won four straight, topping 40 points in each of the wins, and sit alone atop the Pac-12 South heading in to Saturday's game at Arizona State.\n\n\"They have got a senior-laden defense with a lot of experience over there,\" Sun Devils coach Herm Edwards said. \"They don't give up a lot of points, averaging about 16 points a game. They have done a nice job up there.\"\n\nThe Utes, in their 14th season under coach Kyle Whittingham, are 3-0 against Pac-12 South opponents. They lost to Washington and Washington State before reeling off wins over Stanford (40-21), Arizona (42-10), USC (41-28) and UCLA (41-10).\n\nArizona State (4-4, 2-3) is coming off one of its biggest wins under first-year coach Edwards, a 38-35 victory over USC in Los Angeles.\n\n\"They have some weapons,\" Whittingham said. \"They have a very good running back. Their quarterback is dynamic and athletic and their receivers are as good as there is in the country. We have a lot of challenges, particularly for our defense, coming up this week.\"\n\nUtah leads the Pac-12 and is third nationally in rushing defense at 81.1 yards per game. The Utes lead the conference and are seventh nationally in total defense (287 yards) and lead the nation in red zone defense (54.5 percent).\n\n\"They are big and physical up front, especially with their defensive line,\" Edwards said, \"and their secondary is pretty active.\"\n\nUtah's Cody Barton had seven tackles, an interception and a pass breakup last weekend against the Bruins.\n\nHere are some things to consider when the Utes visit the Sun Devils.\n\nROLLING MOSS: Utah's Zack Moss rushed for 211 yards, a career best, in last weekend's win over UCLA.\n\nThe junior has rushed for 964 yards, third-most in the conference and seventh nationally. So he needs just 36 yards for his second consecutive 1,000-yard season. Moss is averaging six yards per carry.\n\nEdwards called Moss \"a really downhill back.\"\n\n\"He's not going to dodge you, he's going to run over you and you better tackle him,\" Edwards said.\n\nHARRY PROBLEM: One of the Utes' biggest challenges is corralling N'Keal Harry, who is coming off a big game at USC.\n\nConsidered one of the best receivers in the country, Harry had two highly memorable plays in that game. His one-handed grab of a pass from Manny Wilkins went viral on Twitter and he had an unlikely reverse-the-field 92-yard punt return for a touchdown.\n\nThe performance alerted much of the country to the talented receiver's abilities.\n\n\"I don't know if maybe the East Coast people don't know,\" Edwards said, \"but I think anybody who watches football and pays attention to it, they know how good he is. When he's playing well and (running back) Eno (Benjamin) and our offensive line is blocking, and Manny has time, our offense can be productive. We have some explosive players.\"\n\nMULTI-PURPOSE COVEY: Utah has a do-everything receiver in Britain Covey, who is tied for third in the conference in receptions with 48 for 531 yards. He is the only non-quarterback in the Pac-12 to throw two touchdown passes this season, a 56-yarder against Arizona and a 7-yarder against UCLA. Covey has five games of at least 100 all-purpose yards this season.\n\n\"He is probably one of the most intelligent players that I have ever coached or been around,\" Whittingham said, \"so he can be taught all of those various positions where he is in the backfield or the slot or involved in special plays.\"\n\nBENJAMIN VS. UTES: Benjamin, Arizona State's bowling ball of a running back, has 938 yards rushing and, with four games remaining, could easily become the Sun Devils' top running back in the Pac-12 era.\n\n\"He is a solid back. He is consistent and a tough runner,\" Whittingham said. \"He has very good vision. He runs behind his pads well and he gets north and south. There isn't a lot of wasted motion with him. He takes good care of the ball. Their whole team is doing well at taking care of the ball. They have only turned it over six times this year and that is low in the Pac-12.\n\n\"We really liked him out of high school and recruited him hard, but ended up not getting him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The team said his timeline to return to basketball activity will be updated in about six weeks, which means he could be out even longer.\n\nThe 30-year-old Love played in Cleveland's first four games before the pain became intolerable. He underwent tests this week and said doctors were still trying to determine the best course of action. Love said the injury became so severe he was having trouble walking and it was affecting his game as he made only 32 percent of his shots in his four games.\n\nEarlier this week, Love said surgery had not been ruled out and the team's medical staff, with input from outside physicians, decided that was the best option for the injury to heal completely.\n\nLove's injury and extended recovery are going to make things even tougher on a team that is 1-7 and regrouping after coach Tyronn Lue was fired Sunday. Cleveland is trying to develop young players while staying competitive, but with Love out it's going to be even harder.\n\nLove signed a $120 million, four-year extension with the club last summer shortly after James left as a free agent.\n\nThe five-time All-Star as missed 45 games because of injuries over the past two seasons.

(Photo: MARK ALLAN/AP)\n\nSpoiler alert! The following contains minor spoilers about the ending of Queen biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\"\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Playing Freddie Mercury on the big screen is daunting enough. But having to re-create the Queen frontman's most iconic concert on the very first day of shooting?\n\n\"It was a baptism by fire,\" says Rami Malek, who charismatically performs the British rocker's entire Live Aid show at the end of the biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (in theaters now). \"You walk out there on that stage as it was replicated from the day, and there was a feeling like you could never imagine of extreme euphoria. You just need to live up to that moment.\"\n\nLive Aid, the massive charity concert for famine relief in Africa, drew more than a billion TV viewers worldwide when it was staged on July 13, 1985, at Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The star-studded lineup included pop and rock acts such as Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Elton John, U2 and Queen, who played a 22-minute set featuring hits \"Radio Ga Ga,\" \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions.\"\n\nIt serves as the centerpiece of the electrifying finale of \"Bohemian,\" which comes just after Mercury's (Malek) devastating diagnosis with HIV/AIDS. Unsure how much time he has left, the ailing Mercury agrees to do the show and make amends with his former bandmates, whom he alienated when he left Queen to pursue a solo career. (In reality, Mercury hadn't yet been diagnosed, and the band was still together.)\n\nQueen's epic Live Aid set, re-created by Gwilym Lee (as Brian May, from left), Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Rami Malek (Freddie Mercury) and Joe Mazzello (John Deacon), is the centerpiece of the biopic \"Bohemenian Rhapsody.\" (Photo: 20th CENTURY FOX)\n\nThe rousing sequence was shot over the course of a week on an old air strip in North London, where the stage of the since-demolished Wembley was built to scale. Cameras were hoisted on cranes and throughout the audience of 2,000 extras, who were multiplied with CGI to replicate the 70,000 concertgoers who packed the stadium for the benefit.\n\nIt was cold and rainy in mid-July when production started on the film, but that didn't dampen the spirits of the enthusiastic crowd on the set. Original Live Aid producer Bob Geldof was in attendance, as were Queen guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, who weighed in on costumes and shared memories from the legendary concert with cast and crew.\n\n\"Everyone, from me to the caterer, was out there clapping along to the songs and cheering on (the actors), because it was all about the atmosphere and energy,\" \"Bohemian\" producer Graham King says. By ending the movie with Live Aid, the goal is \"uplift audiences, rather than have them leave feeling depressed or emotional about Freddie and what he went through in his personal life.

His first child, a son, was born over the summer; those first organized games, and the inevitable questions about \u201celite\u201d travel teams and personal coaches that follow all too quickly, remain years away.\n\n\u201cI can imagine it must be so much worse now,\u201d said Polsky, 39. \u201cI\u2019m almost sick to my stomach just thinking about it. But at root, the issue remains the same: Everybody thinks about being great, but nobody, most notably coaches, truly thinks about how to actually get there, and the paths we\u2019ve created are not only wrong, they sap away all the things that could allow a young athlete to actually flourish.\u201d\n\nPolsky, whose 2014 film Red Army about the storied Soviet Union national hockey team received rave reviews, said the idea for his newest film \u2014 which debuts in 11 cities tonight and more next week \u2014 grew out of his own experiences decades ago. He\u2019d silently question the rigidity of practices and grow confused as he watched Wayne Gretzky play hockey one way while his coaches demanded he play the opposite way. A frustrating career at Yale \u2014 he scored seven points in 27 games over 3 seasons before leaving the team \u2014 left him convinced that the subject needed to be explored.\n\nSo he sat down with Gretzky to ask questions he\u2019d always wanted to ask. Gretzky has long been seen as an outlier, a player we would never be able to understand, let along replicate. He had no discernible physical skills that would set him apart. Not speed. Not size. Not strength. So his success was attributed largely to a level of hockey IQ so preternatural it was not worth even aspiring to.\n\nGretzky, as Polsky expected, found that idea ridiculous.\n\n\u201cIn some ways it can be a difficult thing to even ask about, because what I\u2019m trying to get to is the idea of artistry and creativity, and those things aren\u2019t talked about in sports,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact they\u2019re looked down upon.\n\n\u201cBut Wayne took me there. That\u2019s where his mind went.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a scene in the film when, as Gretzky is getting prepped to officially sit for an interview, Polsky wonders aloud if he\u2019d like to hear some of the questions and topics he\u2019ll be bringing up. But Gretzky quickly replies that he\u2019s more comfortable answering questions without thinking about them beforehand.\n\nThat sort of freedom to read and react, Polsky argues with the film, is an essential key to greatness and is cultivated not through repeated drills but free-flowing, unstructured play meeting unfettered passion. Gretzky recalls his hours spent alone working on the game he loved. And the times spent on the backyard rink, playing shinny with his brothers and neighbors for nothing but pride. And nights spent tracing the path of the puck as it moved around his television screen. He fell in love with the game through play and curiosity, not by being in the \u201cright\u201d league or working \u201charder\u201d than every other kid.\n\nPolsky also speaks at length with Jerry Rice and Pele \u2014 two others he considers the uncontested greatest in their sports. He also intersperses interviews with David Epstein, author of The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance, and Sir Ken Robinson, an expert on education and the role of creativity within it. Speeches from Alan Watts, who popularized Eastern philosophy in the U.S., are used as sign posts throughout the film (the above trailer begins with one.)\n\nPolsky built the film carefully, working systematically toward a conclusion that should be obvious even to those who, in his mind, rely too much on systemic training methods and conformity. His story may be about greatness and the uncomplicated joy it can bring but it is also more than that, as his efforts to recruit youth teams to see the film shows; he has a very clear message he feels should be heard. The film rails against sports specialization and the over-scheduled lives fostered by an increasingly hyper-competitive environment. But it also delivers earnest and open conversation with transcendent athletes, bringing them ever so closer to us.\n\nI\u2019m not sure the film successfully decodes what made Gretzky, Rice or Pele great. Because those players where magical, and in sports there\u2019s still magic \u2014 even after all the ways we\u2019ve learned to break it down and count it up. They are artists. They surprise us. It\u2019s why we watch.\n\nBut In Search of Greatness is an engrossing and important look at what not to do. You can\u2019t help but see all the ways we\u2019re extinguishing the possibility of play blossoming into greatness, and how damaging the maw of youth sports has become. Because it doesn\u2019t spit only the weak or undedicated to the side, as we too often like to pretend. It could have discarded Gretzky and Rice and Pele \u2014 or at least kept them from ever becoming who they were.", "Tim Tebow wasn't happy about how Maryland handled the DJ Durkin firing.

Eventually, Alabama assistant Jeremy Pruitt was hired.\n\n\"Listen, let me tell you something social media's never going to always like you. There's always gonna be naysayers. It changed the Tennessee job. It changed (the Maryland job),\" Tebow added. \"I want these presidents and ADs to stand up and when you say something, have it mean something.

(AP) \u2014 Coach Chip Kelly won't be strolling down memory lane on Saturday when UCLA pays a visit to Oregon.\n\n\"No, we've gotta focus on the team across the other sideline or we'll go get beat,\" Kelly said. \"It'll be an unbelievable experience. It's a special stadium, a special fan base, but we better have our focus and concentration on the 2018 Ducks, not worried about what went on from 2009 to 2012.\"\n\nBoy, have things changed since he left Eugene.\n\nThe Ducks were riding high when Kelly bolted for the NFL. Oregon had just wrapped up the 2012 season in the Fiesta Bowl for its fourth straight BCS Bowl appearance, a string that also included a national championship game.\n\nDuring his time at Oregon, first as the offensive coordinator and then as head coach, Kelly was lauded as the architect of the Ducks' up-tempo \"blur offense.\"\n\nNow in Kelly's first season in Westwood, the Bruins (2-6, 2-3 Pac-12) sit at the bottom of the Pac-12 South standings but are still in the mix because no division team has separated itself by much.\n\nOregon is on its third coach since Kelly's departure. The Ducks let go of Mark Helfrich following the 2016 season, then Willie Taggart stopped by for less than a year en route to Florida State, and now Mario Cristobal leads the Ducks.\n\nOregon (5-3, 2-3) has struggled with two straight losses after a 5-1 start pushed the Ducks as high as No. 12 in the AP rankings. The latest was a 44-15 drubbing on the road in Arizona.\n\n\"Certain things have to improve and those things have been assessed, they have been addressed and practice is structured to be able to improve at those particular areas. That's the only way we know,\" Cristobal said. \"I think our guys understand also is we've got eight seniors on this team, we've got a young football team and when you hit adversity like this, especially when a good brunt of it is self-induced, you've got to buckle down and you've got to really set your focus on the things that we must get better at. There's no magic solution or potion or whatnot. It requires really, really getting ingrained into what you have to do to get better.\"\n\nUCLA is coming off a 41-10 loss at the Rose Bowl to Utah.\n\nFor the record, Kelly went 46-7 as head coach of the Ducks, including a 26-2 mark at Autzen Stadium.\n\nOther things to know:\n\nHERBERT'S STATUS: Oregon's Justin Herbert returned to practice Wednesday after he cleared concussion protocol. The junior quarterback was under observation after a hard hit in the second half of the Arizona loss. He was not yet formally named starter for Saturday's game.\n\nHe has thrown for 2,069 yards and 20 touchdowns with six interceptions on the season.\n\nReceiver Dillon Mitchell, who also was being monitored for a concussion, had not returned to practice by Wednesday. He's got 48 catches for 677 yards and four touchdowns for the Ducks this season.\n\nUCLA'S QUARTERBACK? Last weekend against Utah, Wilton Speight made his first start since the season opener, pressed into duty by Dorian Thompson-Robinson's injured shoulder. Speight passed for 164 yards and ran for another 30.\n\nKelly wasn't revealing his starter for Oregon, and wouldn't even go so far as to say Thompson-Robinson would start if he was healthy.\n\n\"I'm not a hypothetical guy, so there's no reason to make any predictions on this or that. He could be 100 percent and the rest of the team could have bubonic plague and we wouldn't be able to play at all, so we'll see what happens,\" Kelly said.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE: Oregon needs a win to become bowl eligible. UCLA needs a win to avoid a losing season.\n\nSAMUEL OUT: Kelly said junior defensive back Colin Samuel will be out for the season after he tore his ACL on UCLA's opening kickoff against Utah last weekend. Samuel played in five games this year.\n\nHISTORY: The Ducks have won five straight against the Bruins in Eugene, but UCLA hasn't played at Autzen since 2013, when Marcus Mariota was Oregon's quarterback. The last two meetings have been at the Rose Bowl, including last season's 31-14 UCLA victory.\n\nUNIFORMS: Oregon seemed to take a break for a while from the special-edition uniforms, but this week returned with an all-black uniform in collaboration with Nike's Jordan brand.

I can coach them with my eyes closed. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to beat the Golden State Warriors is to go faster than them. \u201cIf you have length and speed you can beat them.\u201d\n\nClassic LaVar Ball right there about coaching them with \u201c(his) eyes closed.\u201d And here\u2019s his take on what Walton\u2019s doing with his son Lonzo without naming the coach:\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand if you have a guy that\u2019s your second pick and you have the best player in the world, then don\u2019t take him out of the game, leave him in the game and rotate the three other guys around him \u2013 that\u2019s how you get victories if you want to win. \u201cBut if you want to try and figure out things, try different combinations and taking guys in and out, then no. \u201cI\u2019m going to go with Lonzo and LeBron. Those two guys are going to stay in the game until we finish winning, and if we\u2019re winning by a lot then everybody else gets to play. \u201cThe game is a game of runs so you have to leave those two main people in there and rotate the other guys. \u201cLonzo is a very special player. He makes everybody around him better so when you play him in a game don\u2019t put him in the corner or put him in with the wrong people because he can\u2019t make them better.\u201d\n\nRemember, it was Ball who called out Walton last season and said he had lost the Lakers\u2019 locker room, and although Walton brushed off the comments with some humor, Ball\u2019s comments echoed through the media for weeks.\n\nBall also told DAZN Germany recently that the Lakers should go and get his other two sons LiAngelo and LaMelo, and compared it to getting Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal:\n\nGuess that answers this recent question from Skip Bayless:", "Undefeated Alabama comes to Death Valley in Baton Rouge on Saturday as 14.5-point favorites over 7-1 LSU in a matchup of two provisional College Football Playoff teams, and the Crimson Tide has won its last three games on the road against the Tigers.\n\nAn LSU win would send shockwaves around the college football world, but ESPN\u2019s Tim Tebow said Friday that he believes the Tigers have a chance to pull off the massive upset. Here are Tebow\u2019s keys to an LSU win:\n\n\u201cNumber one, you have to find a way to get at least two turnovers. I think that is the most important thing\u2026 is find a way to get the crowd into it, and you can do that with turnovers. Number two, I think you\u2019ve got to find a way to hold Alabama to field goals. They\u2019re going to move the ball, they\u2019re going to get some big plays. But hold them to field goals. Three, not six. And finally, I think Joe Burrow has to find a way to get at least three third-downs with his legs. Yes, he\u2019s got to play good with his arm, but he has to do it with his legs. If he\u2019s able to get third-downs with his legs, it keeps LSU having the ball, Tua off the field, time of possession, crowd into it\u2026 I think that\u2019s the game plan. That\u2019s a recipe to win for LSU.\u201d\n\nLSU has lost seven consecutive games against the Crimson Tide, and five of those losses were by double digits.", "CLOSE Authorities have charged Alec Baldwin with assault and harassment after he was arrested for allegedly striking a man in the face during a dispute over a parking spot outside the actor\u2019s New York City home.

(AP) \u2014 Minnesota is just two wins from securing eligibility for a bowl game and the Gophers get a golden opportunity this weekend to lock up a victory.\n\nThe Gophers visit Illinois on Saturday and will face a reeling program that has lost its defensive coordinator, its best passer and its best rusher in the past two weeks. Coach Lovie Smith's team has also lost three straight games and five of six.\n\nMinnesota (4-4, 1-4 Big Ten) has hopes of reaching its first bowl game under coach P.J. Fleck. Last year, the Gophers went 5-7 and missed out. After Illinois, they have back-to-back home games against Purdue and Northwestern before the regular-season finale at rival Wisconsin, where they have not won since 1994.\n\nRedshirt freshman Tanner Morgan will get the start again at quarterback for Minnesota after an excellent performance in beating Indiana last week in his first career start. True freshman Zack Annexstad won the job in fall camp, hurt his ankle in the third game, played through it rather ineffectively and then suffered an unspecified midsection injury in a loss at Nebraska on Oct. 20.\n\nMorgan had the first 300-yard passing game last week for the Gophers since 2015, and may have secured the starting role even if Annexstad gets healthy.\n\n\"Zack is still banged up a little bit, and I think Tanner being healthy, and he's earning opportunities he's earned the right to play,\" Fleck said. \"And it's not like you have a starter that's 30-2 that you're saying, OK, when he gets hurt he comes back, even if he's 85, 90 percent we're going to play him because he gives us the best chance to win.\"\n\nILLINI WOES\n\nDefensive coordinator Hardy Nickerson resigned last Sunday, citing health issues out of his control, after overseeing one of the worst units in the nation. Over the past six games, Illinois has given up 263 points and surrendered 3,471 yards. True freshman quarterback M.J. Rivers, who had wrested the starting job away from senior AJ Bush, suffered a concussion in a loss to Maryland last week and is expected to miss the Minnesota game. Bush is expected to start at quarterback on Saturday. Freshman Matt Robinson will provide backup if Rivers remains sidelined due to concussion protocol.\n\nRunning back Mike Epstein, who along with Reggie Corbin has provided the few offensive bright spots this season, is likely out with an unspecified foot injury.\n\n\"Mike is getting better,\" Smith said. \"I don't know exactly how much better with Mike, but when you miss another game, you know something is going on.\"\n\nSophomore running back Ra'Von Bonner looks to get more playing time for Illinois (3-5, 1-4) in Epstein's absence.\n\nSKILLED GOPHERS\n\nMinnesota junior Tyler Johnson leads the Big Ten with 807 receiving yards and is also tied for the conference lead with eight touchdowns. With four games remaining, he needs 319 yards to break Ron Johnson's all-time single season record of 1,125 yards in 2000. With four straight 100-yard games, Johnson has also matched Eric Decker's program record.\n\n\"It actually means a lot to be able to do that, put my name in the books like that, but one thing about me is I'm just going to continue to work hard and never get complacent,\" Johnson said.\n\nMohamed Ibrahim is expected to return as the starting tailback on Saturday after being held out of the last game because of an undisclosed injury.

Assistant Rob Wright will coach the linebackers and Smith said other staff will take on additional duties.\n\n\"We have a plan in place for what we're going to do,\" Smith said. \"I've been involved with the defense, and I'll call the plays defensively this week.\"\n\nSTILL A CHALLENGE\n\nIllinois is still reeling from a 63-33 shellacking at Maryland last weekend, while Minnesota is coming off the impressive 38-31 win over Indiana. Despite being favored by nearly 10 points over Illinois, Fleck says he understands the challenge.\n\n\"We're looking forward to going on the road and playing a good Illinois team that has a lot of athletes.\" He said. \"There are athletes all over the place, whether you're talking about their defense or their quarterback.

Basically, he\u2019s rocking the pants off his Emmental.\n\nSince September, the cheeses have been blasted with sonic masterpieces from the likes of rock gods Led Zeppelin to hip-hop legends A Tribe Called Quest\u2026. \u201cBacteria is responsible for the formation of the taste of cheese, with the enzymes that influence its maturity. I am convinced that humidity, temperature or nutrients are not the only things that influence taste,\u201d Wampfler said. \u201cSounds, ultrasounds or music can also have physical effects.\u201d\u2026 \u201cAt first we were skeptical,\u201d admitted Michael Harenberg, the university\u2019s music director. \u201cThen we discovered there is a field called sonochemistry that looks at the influences of sound waves, the effect of sound on solid bodies.\u201d\n\nWait, why would you ever be skeptical of a project that aims to determine the effect of Led Zeppelin on cheese?\n\nI\u2019m sorry to be the one to deliver this news yet again, but this dumb thing that\u2019s currently amusing people online is actually dumb. Without knowing much at all about general chemistry, sonochemistry, cheesemaking, cheese aging, bacteriology or the scientific method, I feel comfortable casting serious doubt about the legitimacy of this experiment.\n\nEven if you allow that maybe playing, like, an incredibly loud, incredibly low drone tone for a cheese\u2019s entire maturation process might have some minor impact on how the cheese develops, how many wheels of cheese would you need to produce to control for all the variables (that I assume exist) and prove definitively that sound changes cheese? And how downright preposterous is it to expect cheese to distinguish in any way between two pieces of popular Western music governed by the same blues scales and backbeats?\n\nLiterally everyone in the world enjoys A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s Can I Kick It?, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and guess cheese doesn\u2019t care because cheese does not think or feel or dance or love.\n\nOn a personal note, I want to add that I spent way, way too much time trying to come up with cheese puns on Led Zeppelin lyrics, and for a while planned to include one for every song on Led Zeppelin IV but bailed because I couldn\u2019t come up with one for Misty Mountain Hop without using a cheese I had already included elsewhere.

Hall (75) in the first half against Washington State during an NCAA college football game on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018, in Stanford, Calif. (AP Photo/Don Feria) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Somewhere along the line, Washington and Stanford's anticipated showdown for the Pac-12 North title got sidetracked. Or better yet, sideswiped.\n\nFor the Cardinal, it was a pair of unexpected home losses to Utah and Washington State. For the Huskies, it was road stumbles at Oregon and, shockingly, at California.\n\nNow Saturday's matchup in Seattle has become an elimination game instead of the premiere matchup it was supposed to be. The loser will be saddled with three conference losses and will need a lot of help to catch No. 10 Washington State by the end of the regular season.\n\nThe Cardinal (5-3, 3-2 Pac-12) are already in the position of needing extra help after losing to Washington State last week. A third conference loss would essentially eliminate any hopes of a division title.\n\nWashington's situation isn't as precarious but a loss would be a huge blow. The Huskies (6-3, 4-2) still have a matchup with Washington State in the regular-season finale. A win Saturday plus a win over Oregon State in two weeks could mean the Apple Cup rivalry game will be a winner-take-all affair for the second time in three seasons.\n\nBut it's still a huge disappointment for Stanford and Washington to be in this position. In a sign of how much luster has come off what was supposed to be one of the biggest Pac-12 North games of the season, the Huskies and Cardinal are being relegated to the Pac-12 Network.\n\nWashington's biggest question will be how it reacts after last week's offensive slog in a 12-10 loss to California that included the benching of starting quarterback Jake Browning in the second half. The Huskies have been regressing offensively in recent weeks, but should be getting a boost with the possible return of running back Myles Gaskin after he missed the past two games with a shoulder injury. Washington might also see the season debut of talented tight end Hunter Bryant, who has yet to play due to an offseason knee injury.\n\n\"We're sitting in there every week figuring out how do we make this a little bit better. We will make progress,\" Washington coach Chris Petersen said.\n\nStanford's biggest question will be the status of running back Bryce Love, who has rushed for only 413 yards and three touchdowns while dealing with a lingering ankle problem. Love had 71 yards rushing last week against Washington State, but carried just six times.\n\nHere are other things to watch as the Huskies and Cardinal meet with both teams unranked for the first time since 2008:\n\nMORE TACKLES: Washington LB Ben Burr-Kirven continues to lead the country in tackles with 122, 38 more than he had all last season in 13 games. Burr-Kirven has recorded at least 13 tackles in six of Washington's nine games. Burr-Kirven had 14 last week against California.\n\n\"When I watch tapes of his high school games, all he does is tackle everybody. Since he's been at Washington, all he's done is tackle everybody. Call him a tweener or call him a safety-linebacker, the guy is a great football player,\" Stanford coach David Shaw said.\n\nTHROW IT UP: With Love's lingering injury, the Cardinal have put more of the offense in the hands of quarterback K.J. Costello and his assortment of big wide receivers and tight ends. Costello is averaging 270.6 yards per game passing and ranks in the top 20 nationally in yards passing, touchdowns and completion percentage.\n\nHe may get a chance to challenge a Washington secondary that's had very few quarterbacks throw downfield on it this season. The Huskies are allowing just 171.7 yards passing per game and only three teams \u2014 Auburn, UCLA, Oregon \u2014 have thrown for more than 200 yards against Washington.\n\nESTABLISH THE RUN: Washington was held under 100 yards rushing last week for the first time since it lost at Arizona State last season. The Huskies had 91 yards rushing against California; they had 91 yards rushing a year ago against Arizona State.\n\nGetting Gaskin back would be a big boost, as would finding ways to get speedy Salvon Ahmed going. Ahmed had eight carries for (minus)-2 yards against California.\n\nTURNOVER TIME: When Stanford forces turnovers, it wins. When the Cardinal don't, they lose. It's not often that simple, but that's been the case for Stanford this season. In their five wins, the Cardinal have forced 12 turnovers. In their three losses, they've forced zero.\n\nStanford has committed six turnovers in the three losses.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Here's what you need to know. USA TODAY\n\nDaylight Savings Time could negatively affect your health if you normally do not get enough sleep, experts say. (Photo: demaerre, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nDaylight Saving Time ends and clocks will \"fall back\" an hour this weekend, giving Americans the feeling of an extra hour in the morning, which could negatively affect their health.\n\n\"Ever since the institution of Daylight Saving Time, there has been controversy regarding whether it accomplishes its goals or not, and if so \u2014 at what cost,\" Timothy Morgenthaler, Mayo Clinic's co-director of the Center for Sleep Medicine, said in an email.\n\nMorgenthaler has reviewed about 100 medical papers related to how the time change could affect health.\n\nHere's what you should know:\n\nSleep\n\nGaining or losing an hour will likely affect sleep patterns, often for about five to seven days, Morgenthaler said. The most notable changes are in those who regularly do not get enough sleep. People who are sleep-deprived might struggle with memory, learning, social interactions and overall cognitive performance.\n\n\"People have more changes in how sleepy they feel or how it affects the quality of their sleep when we 'spring forward' than when we 'fall back,'\" Morgenthaler said.\n\nMore: 10 things you didn't know about daylight saving time\n\nHeart attack or stroke\n\nAccording to a study led by a University of Colorado fellow in 2014, when Americans lose one hour of sleep in the spring, the risk of heart attack increases 25 percent. When the clock gives back that hour of sleep the risk of heart attack decreases by 21 percent. (The limited study looked at hospital admission data in Michigan over a four-year period.)\n\nA preliminary study presented at the 2016 American Academy of Neurology meeting suggested turning the clock ahead or behind an hour could increase risk of stroke. That's because disrupting a person's internal body clock might increase the risk of ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, according to researchers. The data showed risk of ischemic stroke was 8 percent higher two days after a Daylight Saving Time.\n\nThese studies are two of several on these negative health effects, and they don't always paint the whole picture, Morgenthaler said.\n\n\"Of several published between 2010 and 2014, three studies showed that DST increases the risk of acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs), however, two others demonstrated that the timing (but not the incidence) of strokes and AMIs may be influenced by DST,\" Morgenthaler points out.\n\nCrashes\n\nMany have also studied the time change's impact on vehicle crashes and fatalities. The largest studies that correct for volume and driving activity as well as time of day \"show no significant effect\" on Daylight Saving Time changes, Morgenthaler said.

Although winning doesn\u2019t guarantee them a spot because there are only four, with the exception of perhaps just two teams, a loss will almost certainly eliminate them from contention.\n\nSo for those who remain furious there are only four playoff spots in college football or who are baffled by the sport\u2019s inability to concoct another solution, that\u2019s how you need to approach the final few weeks of the regular season. Win and your team remains in the hunt, lose and you\u2019re (probably) done.\n\nAnd because of this, there are several games this weekend with playoff implications, so we\u2019re here to break them down.\n\nNote: No. 12 in the playoff rankings, UCF beat Temple on Thursday night and remains undefeated. But it\u2019s hope for the playoff is still a long shot.\n\nNo. 1/1 Alabama (8-0) at No. 4/4 LSU (7-1)\n\nGame time: 8 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: CBS\n\nGoing into this game, the closest the Crimson Tide has come to losing was its 45-23 win over Texas A&M back in Week 4. With the best offense in the country, Alabama has cruised to victories in every game so far this season, but the Tigers could prove to be the first real test for a couple reasons. LSU is seventh in the country in defense efficiency (Alabama is second), and it\u2019s in a three-way tie at No. 1 for interceptions this season with 14, along with Maryland and Fresno State.\n\nThat\u2019s great for the Tigers and all \u2014 plus a surely wild environment in Death Valley \u2014 but the problem is Alabama quarterback and Heisman Trophy favorite Tua Tagovailoa has thrown 25 touchdown passes so far and not a single interception. He\u2019s averaging more than 13 yards per pass and has a 70.4 completion percentage. Plus, coming off the bye week \u2014 though LSU had the week off too \u2014 Tagovailoa told reporters he has recovered from his knee sprain and is at 100 percent.\n\nLSU is ranked No. 3 in the opening College Football Playoff projections, and an upset over Alabama as a two-touchdown underdog would likely send the Tigers to the SEC championship game. Hypothetically if they won that as well, it would be impossible for the selection committee to deny them a playoff spot. But an in-conference loss Saturday would knock them out of contention.\n\nAlabama is one of the teams that could lose a game this season and still make the playoff, like last year. A loss to LSU would knock the Crimson Tide out of the SEC championship game, but assuming it wins its remaining games against Mississippi State, The Citadel and Auburn, it\u2019s reasonable to think Alabama will make the playoff, along with the conference champion. A win, however, keeps Nick Saban\u2019s team in control of the SEC West and on track to face the winner of this week\u2019s Georgia-Kentucky game. So speaking of\u2026\n\nNo. 6/6 Georgia (7-1) at No. 9/11 Kentucky (7-1)\n\nGame time: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: CBS\n\nAfter Kentucky\u2019s controversial win over Missouri last weekend, the winner of this game will represent the SEC East in the conference championship game. The key for the Wildcats is their defense, which is currently nationally ranked at No. 1 in scoring defense, along with Clemson, and No. 12 in total defense. (Georgia is Nos. 12 and 15, respectively, in those categories.) If Kentucky\u2019s defense can shut down Bulldogs quarterback Jake Fromm and stifle the run game, it will have a good chance at the upset.\n\nBut if the defense can\u2019t stop Georgia, the Wildcats\u2019 offense might not be able to match the Bulldogs\u2019 scoring potential. Georgia\u2019s defense shouldn\u2019t have too much of a problem containing Kentucky\u2019s 101st-ranked offense, and since the Wildcats\u2019 Week 6 overtime loss to Texas A&M, their last two victories have been by eight points combined. Georgia is a 9-point favorite.\n\nDespite each having a loss, Georgia and Kentucky debuted on the College Football Playoff rankings at No. 6 and No. 9 respectively, while the Bulldogs have a 43 percent chance to make the playoff. But because of those losses, the loser of this game is out of the playoff race, as well as the SEC title game. The winner, should it also win the conference championship, would likely make the playoff.\n\nNo. 14/13 Penn State (6-2) at No. 5/5 Michigan (7-1)\n\nGame time: 3:45 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: ESPN\n\nA team with two losses has never made the College Football Playoff, and it doesn\u2019t seem like this Nittany Lions squad is going to be the first to do that. So it\u2019s going for the role of the spoiler more than anything else this weekend. But Penn State hasn\u2019t looked great lately, struggling before eventually putting away Iowa and Indiana most recently and losing to Michigan State and Ohio State before that. Nittany Lions quarterback Trace McSorely is dealing with a knee injury and will play despite not being at 100 percent.\n\nBut Michigan is coming in hot with the No. 1 defense in the country and a seven-game win streak since it\u2019s season-opening loss to Notre Dame. Being at home adds another advantage, as does coming off a bye week, and the Wolverines are a 10.5-point favorite.\n\nAfter Week 9, Michigan has a 37 percent chance to make the playoff and is No. 5 on the initial College Football Playoff rankings. It could move up, depending on the result and score of the Alabama-LSU game, and jump over Georgia in terms of chances if the Bulldogs lose, but that\u2019s all contingent on a victory Saturday.

They\u2019re also at No. 7 in the playoff rankings and have a 33 percent shot at the playoff still, but they need to win out, including in the conference title game. With that loss earlier this season to Texas, Oklahoma can\u2019t afford another one if it \u2014 and the Big 12 \u2014 want to keep hope alive for a playoff berth.\n\nOklahoma will need some help from the teams ranked higher than it to actually advance to the playoff \u2014 we\u2019re looking at Michigan, Georgia, LSU or even Notre Dame \u2014 but none of that matters if it doesn\u2019t finish the season with one loss.", "Washington St. quarterback Gardner Minshew, II throws during warmups against Stanford during an NCAA college football game on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018, in Stanford, Calif. (AP Photo/Don Feria) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWashington State resumes its longshot quest to crash the College Football Playoff as well as its bid to take the Pac-12 North when the No. 10 Cougars host California on Saturday night.\n\nWashington State (7-1, 4-1 Pac-12, No. 8 CFP) is the only remaining Pac-12 team with a single loss, and the Cougars almost certainly need to win out for a chance at their first playoff bid.\n\nCoach Mike Leach isn't looking that far down the road. He's focused on beating a Cal (5-3, 2-3) team that routed the Cougars last year and knocked them out of the Top 10.\n\n\"I'm just worried about beating Cal,\" Leach said. \"We'll just focus on playing Cal as best we can.\"\n\nLeach is known for thinking the playoff field should be expanded. At minimum, all conference champions should be in the playoffs, Leach said.\n\nWith just four teams, \"really good\" programs are left out, Leach said.\n\nSaturday's game will feature a classic showdown between Washington State's potent offense, which is averaging 40.8 points, and a California defense that is the best in the Pac-12 against the pass. The Bears knocked previous No. 15 Washington out of the Top 25 when they beat the Huskies 12-10 last weekend.\n\nCal allows just 165 passing yards per game and they have held seven of eight opponents under 350 yards of total offense.\n\n\"They bounce around on defense,\" Leach said. \"They play hard. They're physical.\"\n\nThe big problem for California is that the Bears don't score much, and WSU also has a solid defense.\n\n\"They play really good defense,\" Cal coach Justin Wilcox said. \"We've got a ton of respect for them.\"\n\nWilcox said one key for the Bears will be constantly changing the formations that Cougars quarterback Gardner Minshew sees across the line of scrimmage.\n\nMinshew is adept at extending plays until he finds an open receiver. Many other quarterbacks will throw the ball away if no one is open, Wilcox said. Minshew, who has a deep and talented receiving corps, doesn't do that often.\n\n\"If it's initially not there, he'd going to bide his time and find a window,\" Wilcox said. \"You've got to play the whole down.\"\n\nWashington State is seeking its first Pac-12 North title and can secure it by winning its final four games. The Cougars' 11-game home winning streak is the fourth-longest in the nation, behind Alabama (24), Clemson (12) and Washington (12).\n\nLast year, Cal shut down the Air Raid and clobbered the Cougars 37-3 in Berkeley.\n\nLeach said there was not much to take from that game.\n\nOther things to watch Saturday when the Cougars host Cal, which has won 11 of its past 13 games against Washington State:\n\nTHE CONSTANT GARDNER: There were plenty of WSU fans wearing fake Gardner Minshew mustaches for Halloween, and there is a good reason why. Over the past four games, all Washington State wins, the quarterback known as the Mississippi Mustache has completed 140 of 197 passes (.711), for 1,636 yards and 15 touchdowns. Leach thinks Minshew is the best quarterback in the country. \"He's got the best numbers so he's the best one,\" Leach said.\n\nLOCAL CONNECTION: Cal linebacker Evan Weaver is a native of Spokane, Washington, but he spurned the nearby Cougars to go to school in Berkeley. Weaver is the reigning Pac-12 defensive player of the week after returning an interception for a touchdown against Washington. \"We tried to recruit him,\" Leach said. \"He told us no.\"\n\nRUNNING BEAR: Cal running back Patrick Laird has 660 rushing yards and five touchdowns this season and is on track to rush for 1,000 yards for the second consecutive year.\n\nIT'S CATCHING: Washington State running back James Williams has 48 receptions to lead all running backs in the nation.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic remains on course for a fifth Paris Masters title after beating Marin Cilic 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 on Friday to set up a semifinal against Roger Federer.\n\nFederer advanced to their 47th career meeting by beating Kei Nishikori 6-4, 6-4, his sixth straight win against the Japanese player.\n\nChasing his 100th career title after winning the Swiss Indoors last Sunday, the 20-time Grand Slam champion was hardly troubled. He saved a break point with a sharp volley at the net when serving for the set at 5-4 and then broke Nishikori at the start of the second set to take firm control.\n\nFederer has won this tournament only once, back in 2011, and has not played here since 2015. He was given a huge ovation by the crowd after his win.\n\nNow he has to find a way past Djokovic, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion who has beaten Federer in their past three meetings and leads him 24-22 overall.\n\n\"If the crowd is for Novak that's also good, as long as the (arena) is full. I know I have fans here, I can't complain,\" Federer said. \"I have an enormous amount of support around the world. But for my fans to get into the match, I also have to play some good tennis.\"\n\nFederer lost to Djokovic most recently in the Cincinnati Masters final in August.\n\n\"I hope I play better than in Cincinnati because I really didn't play well,\" Federer said. \"It was the worst day of my career for returning. I missed all the second returns.\"\n\nDjokovic, who is guaranteed to take the No. 1 ranking on Monday, struggled on his serve for much of the first set.\n\nCilic had chances to break him in the fifth and seventh games and finally did so in the ninth when Djokovic hit a backhand long.\n\nAn ace gave Cilic set point and he took it when Djokovic sent a backhand wide.\n\nDjokovic broke for 3-1 in the second set and did not look back.\n\nIn the third set, a Cilic cross-court forehand winner saw him break a for 2-1 lead.\n\nDjokovic broke his racket in frustration and then broke Cilic straight back, after which the momentum shifted back in his favor as Cilic lost to him for the 16th time in 18 meetings.\n\n\"It was a very intense match,\" Djokovic said. \"I was kind of going up and down. I'm really pleased to overcome this kind of challenge.\"\n\nIt was also Djokovic's 21st consecutive win since losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas in the third round of the Rogers Cup in August.\n\nEarlier, Dominic Thiem beat defending champion Jack Sock 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nThe Austrian served out the match and clinched victory on his first match point when Sock hit a big forehand long.\n\n\"I'm in the semifinals of a Masters 1000 only for the fourth time,\" Thiem said. \"It means a lot for me because I didn't do too well in the previous years in this part of the season.\"\n\nThe sixth-seeded Thiem next faces unseeded Karen Khachanov of Russia in their first career meeting.\n\nKhachanov, who won the Kremlin Cup in Moscow last month, broke fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev's serve six times in a 6-1, 6-2 win.\n\nZverev had treatment on his right shoulder late in the first set and made a string of unforced errors. He took exception to some comments made in Khachanov's box and spoke to his opponent at the end of the first set.\n\n\"I told him my shoulder is hurting and that his uncle, or something, that he's going a bit crazy,\" Zverev said. \"I told him to tell him to keep it down a little bit because he was going a little bit too much over the edge.\"\n\nCilic and Thiem sealed the last two spots for the season-ending ATP Finals in London, starting on Nov. 11.\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nSimone Biles of the U.S. shows her gold medal after the women's vault final on the first day of the apparatus finals of the of the Gymnastics World Chamionships at the Aspire Dome in Doha, Qatar, on Nov. 2. (Photo: Vadim Ghirda, AP)\n\nOnly Simone Biles could upstage herself.\n\nA day after becoming the first woman to win four all-around titles at the world gymnastics championships, Biles made more history Friday with a gold medal on vault. It was her 13th world title \u2013 yes, you read that right \u2013 which is more than any other gymnast, male or female, has won.\n\nOh, she also won her first medal on uneven bars, a silver, giving her at least one on every event in her career. That means she still has a shot to be the first woman since Romania\u2019s Daniela Silivas at the 1988 Olympics to win six medals in a single competition.\n\nBiles competes Saturday on floor exercise, where she\u2019s the reigning Olympic champion and has won three world titles; and balance beam, where she\u2019s a two-time world champion.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to come out here and redeem myself,\u201d Biles said, \u201cand I think I did that tonight.\u201d\n\nMore: Simone Biles makes history as first woman to win four all-around world titles\n\nMore: By winning world title on an 'off' day, Biles shows how great she really is\n\nBiles was unhappy with herself after falling twice, on vault and balance beam, during Thursday\u2019s all-around competition. She does such difficult routines that the falls didn\u2019t matter \u2013 she beat Japan\u2019s Mai Murakami by 1.693 points, her largest margin of victory at worlds \u2013 but Biles said afterward she didn\u2019t feel as if she had \u201cearned\u201d the title.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the gymnast that I am, to go out there and kind of bomb a meet like this,\u201d Biles said Thursday night. \u201cEven though I won, I wish it were a little bit different. Mai had such a good meet. It just sucks that I did so bad and I still won.\u201d\n\nThat anger would fuel her in event finals, Biles said. Did it ever.\n\nThough Biles had wanted another crack at the tough new vault she debuted in team qualifying \u2013 a roundoff with a half-twist onto the vaulting table and then a front double full somersault off \u2013 coach Laurent Landi talked her out of it. Despite her fall on it Thursday, she had nothing to prove, Landi said.\n\nSo Biles did an \u201ceasier\u201d vault instead, a Cheng, which only has 1\u00bd twists. She landed a little low and had to take a big step forward to steady herself, but she was only one of two gymnasts to even try it and still had the highest execution score of anyone in the final.\n\nHer second vault was an Amanar, which used to be the Holy Grail of vaults. Biles also took a slight step on that one, but she finished with a score of 15.366, more than eight-tenths higher than silver medalist Shallon Olsen of Canada.\n\nIt was Biles\u2019 first world title on vault, though she is the reigning Olympic champion on the event.\n\n\u201cHow crazy,\u201d she said.\n\nThough she won silver on uneven bars, her finish was no less impressive.\n\nUneven bars used to be Biles\u2019 worst event, and she joked that she once wanted to \u201cchainsaw every bar in the country and in the world.\u201d But Landi is as close to an uneven bars whisperer as there is in the sport \u2013 he also coached 2015 co-world champion Madison Kocian \u2013 and when he and Biles began working together last November he made improving that event a priority.\n\nAsked if she would ever have imagined last fall that that work would result in a medal, Biles just laughed.\n\n\u201cI would have probably said I\u2019m quitting. To even work and put that much effort into bars, I would have probably been like, 'No, no thank you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI really put the work and the effort to bring up that event to the level with the others.\u201d\n\nNow her biggest problem is figuring out what to do with all these medals. She gave her gold from the team final to her parents, and the one from the all-around will go to Landi and his wife, Cecile. As for the vault one, Biles is considering keeping it \u2013 providing she can keep it away from her French bulldog, Lilo.\n\n\u201cBecause she ruins everything,\u201d Biles said.\n\nThe exact opposite of her owner, whose days at the world championships keep getting better.", "COLUMBIA, S.C.

The Cubs traded Smyly and a player to be named later to the Texas Rangers on Friday, Nov. 2, 2018. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The Chicago Cubs exercised their $20 million option on Cole Hamels on Friday, solidifying their rotation for next year, and traded fellow left-hander Drew Smyly to the Texas Rangers.\n\nHamels, who turns 35 in December, went 4-3 with a 2.36 ERA in 12 starts after he was acquired in a July 27 trade with Texas \u2014 a frequent trade partner for Chicago since Theo Epstein took over the Cubs' front office in 2011. Had the Cubs declined the option and paid a $6 million buyout, the Rangers would have paid the Cubs an additional $6 million.\n\nThe 29-year-old Smyly is heading to Texas after missing his only year in Chicago as part of his recovery from Tommy John surgery in June 2017. The Cubs also parted with a player to be named in exchange for a player to be named.\n\nSmyly signed a $10 million, two-year contract with Chicago last December. He was healthy at the end of last season, but the contending Cubs ran out of time in terms of bringing him back.\n\nChicago also claimed infielder Jack Reinheimer off waivers from the New York Mets. The 26-year-old Reinheimer hit .167 in 21 games with New York this year.\n\nHamels gives manager Joe Maddon a deep group of starting pitchers as the Cubs try for their fifth consecutive playoff appearance. Jon Lester, Kyle Hendricks, Jose Quintana and Yu Darvish also are expected to return, with Mike Montgomery and Tyler Chatwood waiting in the wings.\n\nHamels, a former first-round pick, made his major league debut with Philadelphia in 2006. He is 156-114 with a 3.40 ERA in 13 big league seasons.\n\nHe was working on perhaps the worst season of his career when Chicago got him from Texas for right-hander Eddie Butler, minor league pitcher Rollie Lacy and a player to be named. He was 5-9 with a 4.72 ERA in 20 starts with the last-place Rangers at the time of the trade, but the Cubs felt a change of scenery and a pennant race might help him get back on track.\n\nThey were right.\n\nHamels had an instant impact with Chicago, going 4-0 with a sparkling 0.79 ERA in his first five starts with the team. He was unbeaten with the Cubs until he was hit hard in a loss at Arizona in his 10th start on Sept. 19.\n\nWhen the NL wild-card game went into extra innings, Hamels made just his second major league relief appearance and responded with two scoreless innings in Chicago's 2-1 loss to Colorado. He is 7-6 with a 3.41 ERA in 17 career playoff appearances.\n\nThe option completes the deal Hamels signed with Philadelphia in July 2012, bringing the total value to $158 million for seven years.\n\nHamels struck out 13 while pitching a no-hitter at Wrigley Field in his final start with Philadelphia in 2015. He was traded to Texas six days later, and helped the Rangers to two AL West titles.\n\nEarlier this week, the Cubs exercised their $6.25 million option for Pedro Strop and fellow reliever Brandon Kintzler picked up his $5 million player option.\n\nStrop, one of the baseball's most consistent relievers since he was acquired in a July 2013 trade with Baltimore, went 6-1 with 13 saves and a 2.26 ERA in 60 appearances last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

What started out as an exploration of how the NBA became the most culturally relevant league \u2013 with a social aspect \u2013 had already taken shape.

But once they started digging in, they realized the story was much broader than those three classes, and it was impossible to ignore the contributions of players not in those draft classes \u2013 such as Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell.\n\n\u201cIt evolved because as we started making this, we realized these eras and these players had a much greater effect outside of basketball,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIt was more about culture. That was the story we had to tell, that basketball was truly America\u2019s sport.\u201d\n\nThe docu-series focuses on the NBA\u2019s cultural and on-court relevance, from Michael Jordan\u2019s impact on endorsements to Allen Iverson\u2019s style to hip-hop\u2019s influence on the NBA and its stars. It also hits on other touchstone moments \u2013 The Malice at the Palace, James\u2019 jump to the NBA and his subsequent missteps and successes, Russell\u2019s game-altering abilities and Robertson\u2019s fight for free agency.\n\nAnd, it details some the civil rights issues players and society has faced, including some important but unheralded stories, such as Craig Hodges\u2019 White House visit with the 1991 championship Chicago Bulls where he wore a dashiki and hand-delivered President Bush a letter, asking him to do more for poor people, Native Americans and African Americans.\n\nThe documentary also takes another look at former NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, who didn\u2019t stand for the national anthem because he said it was against his Muslim faith.\n\n\u201cI look at the series as the alternate history of the NBA,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cIn watching this, it\u2019s not \u2018who are the best players and teams?\u2019 We don\u2019t really talk about Kobe Bryant. We don\u2019t really talk about of the San Antonio Spurs. We talk about guys like Craig Hodges. We talk about Mamoud Abdul-Rauf, who was the original (Colin) Kaepernick. We walk about Allen Iverson.

(Photo: RAMINDER PAL SINGH, EPA-EFE)\n\nNew Delhi, India, one of the top cities for air pollution in the world, is bracing for a thick layer of smog this winter.\n\nA process known as burning \"crop stubble\" will exacerbate smog in cities like New Delhi and Kanpur, India, Bloomberg reported. Farmers traditionally clear their fields after wheat and other grains have been harvested by burning the remainder of their crops to prepare for the next planting season, even though the process was technically banned from parts of the country in 2015.\n\nThe smoke from this process contributes to the road construction dust and industrial emissions that bring smog to India year-round.\n\nLow wind speeds are also worsening smog conditions by not \"dispersing\" the pollutants in the air, India Today reported.\n\nThough the pollution from burning crop stubble is expected to dissipate by spring, it still points to India's greater air pollution problem, especially in New Delhi. There was not a single day in 2017 when air pollution levels in the city were deemed \"healthy\" for children or adults by the World Health Organization.\n\nWhat else do you need to know about the blanket of smog in India right now? USA TODAY breaks it down:\n\nCrop stubble burning caused one-quarter of the air pollution in New Delhi in November 2017, according to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.\n\nIndia is home to the top ten smoggiest cities by both PM 2.5 and PM 10 measures. PM 2.5 are the small particles of air pollution that pose the greatest threat to human respiratory systems, according to the WHO. PM 10 are the larger particles that still pose health threats for your lungs.\n\nThe WHO deems up to 50 micrograms of PM 2.5 per cubic meter healthy. In 2017, there were 39 days when readings exceeded 300 micrograms.\n\nAs a result, New Delhi schools had to close for days in 2017 because children's lungs are particularly susceptible to air pollution. They also closed in 2016 due to dangerous levels of smog.\n\nIn 2015, approximately 1.1 million people died due to air pollution in India, according to the non-profit Health Effects Institute. The WHO reported an average of 4.2 million people die annually from outdoor exposure to air pollution.\n\nIndian students of Pearl Academy, a fashion school, wear masks and take part in a fashion march to create awareness about the air pollution in New Delhi, India on November 2, 2018.

Cooking over open flames and the use of kerosene promotes direct exposure to air pollutants, which threatens communities without access to electricity.\n\nState governments across India are using public service announcements to discourage burning crop stubble, including a new song called Saari Na Parali Veere, Saari Na (Don\u2019t Burn the Stubble Brother, Don't Burn). It has gone viral on social media, and a video is in the works, according to the Times of India.\n\nAir pollution and construction are even turning the Taj Mahal's famous white walls green and yellow.

Rodgers has been at his MVP form even as the rest of the Packers struggle. \"He's still the best or is tied for the best on the planet,\" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan says. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOf all the NFL seasonal awards, the one shaping up as the closest and most intriguing is for Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nHow could it not be with the likes of Aaron Rodgers and Adrian Peterson , who have won league MVP honors, plus three-time Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt and Colts quarterback Andrew Luck as front-runners?\n\nQuite a few big names are back in action after curtailed 2017 seasons, among them Carson Wentz, Odell Beckham Jr., David Johnson and Deshaun Watson. Unless they have spectacular second halves of the schedule, though, the attention belongs on that impressive quartet of Rodgers, Peterson, Watt and Luck.\n\nAll four have had a significant impact, perhaps most notably Peterson, the previous non-quarterback to win the league's MVP award (in 2012) and the only non-QB to take it since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006. Remember, Peterson, 33, was available to everyone as a free agent before the Redskins reached out.\n\nHe has paid them back by ranking fifth in rushing with 587 yards, has four touchdowns, and is surrounded on the stats sheet by guys who weren't even in high school when Peterson broke in for Minnesota in 2007.\n\n\"I think he's embodied kind of a little bit of what we want to be about not only as an offense but as a team,\" says Redskins quarterback Alex Smith. \"I just think the way he's played on that edge \u2014 physical, relentless. I think that's what we want to be about, not only as an offense, but a football team playing with that kind of an edge all the time. That kind of physicality certainly helped set the tone for us quite a few times this year.\"\n\nWashington leads the NFC East at 5-2 even though its passing game ranks 26th. Credit a strong defense and the work of \"All Day.\"\n\nThat moniker would certainly fit Watt, too. No one puts in more effort on the field \u2014 and Watt has put in the same level of diligence recovering from not one but two major injuries. He played a total of eight games in 2016-17.\n\nHis return to the Texans started slowly, as did Houston with three straight defeats. Then Watt began dominating, and the Texans (5-3) began winning. They now lead the AFC South, and Watt is tied for the conference lead with eight sacks while stopping the run as well as any edge rusher around.\n\n\"I'm still not where I want to be yet,\" Watt says; that's a scary thought for opponents. \"I still have plenty of growth and plenty of things to work on. But I didn't make it to Game 8 in either of the last two seasons so I'm happy with that ...\n\n\"Like I've always said the whole time, I don't blame anybody who didn't know if I was going to be the same again because there were times I didn't know. So, I can't sit here and get too mad at people who thought I might be washed up or thought I might be done. Because I was sitting in that same boat when I was sitting at home with a cast on my leg and not being able to walk, and thinking: 'Man, will I be the same again?'\"\n\nCertainly, Luck could have asked that same question after missing 2017 with a shoulder problem. It's never truly been clear if the injury was misdiagnosed or mistreated, or that Indy simply was fooled by the length of time its starting quarterback would need to recover.\n\nBut recover he has, and even with a paucity of skill position talent around him, Luck is looking very good. He has thrown for 23 touchdowns, second only to Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes, who has tremendous talent at wideout and running back to work with. Luck is moving well and, most significantly, his arm strength is excellent.\n\nThen there's Rodgers, who might have grabbed last year's comeback award had he returned from his collarbone problems and revived Green Bay's season, getting the Packers into the playoffs. But it didn't play out that way last December, and he finished the season on injured reserve.\n\nSo he definitely qualifies in this category, and he has also battled a knee issue most of the season. Yet Rodgers has been at his MVP form even as the rest of the Packers struggle.\n\n\"He's still the best or is tied for the best on the planet,\" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan says. \"He always has been. He's the man. I know he's not 100 percent, everyone knows that, but he seems to be a little bit better each week. He's still the best.\"\n\nBut is he the guy the AP's 50 voters will support for Comeback Player of the Year in such a loaded field?\n\nTune in Feb. 2 when the award winners are announced.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

We need to have a really strong week of preparation. We need to get our team feeling good and healthy. We came out of a very physical football game last weekend, and then march on and get ready to get win No. 7.\"\n\nHere are some other things to watch when Boston College visits Virginia Tech:\n\nBOUNCEBACK?\n\nThe Hokies have rarely been worse defensively than they were against Georgia Tech, and have had a few extra days to prepare for a power ground game vs. the Yellow Jackets' triple option. But while inexperience is inexperience, Bud Foster's crew has generally been stronger when playing a more conventional offense.\n\nOLD RIVALS\n\nThe Hokies and Eagles are rivals from their Big East days, and BC claimed one of its more notable victories in Lane Stadium. On Oct. 25, 2007, Matt Ryan led a fourth quarter comeback with 14 unanswered points as the third-ranked Eagles defeated the 11th-ranked Hokies 14-10.\n\nBIG-PLAY DEFENDERS\n\nThe Eagles boast DE Wyatt Ray, tied for third nationally with nine sacks, and CB Hemp Cheevers, tied for second nationally with five interceptions. Virginia Tech is led by DL Ricky Walker and DB Reggie Floyd, but the rest of the unit is among Bud Foster's youngest since becoming the defensive coordinator in 1995.\n\nI KNOW YOU\n\nBoston College's offense is headed up by offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler, who was the OC under former head coach Frank Beamer from 2013-15. The Eagles' defense is led by Jim Reid, who was the defensive coordinator at Virginia under Mike London from 2010-12.\n\nHIGH STAKES\n\nThe Hokies were expected to contend for the ACC's Coastal Division title, and they are at 3-1 in league play. They also have three of their last four games at home. The Eagles are a surprise contender in the Atlantic Division and play a rugged Big East style that is unlike most of the more finessed approaches in the ACC.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Although winning doesn\u2019t guarantee them a spot because there are only four, with the exception of perhaps just two teams, a loss will almost certainly eliminate them from contention.\n\nSo for those who remain furious there are only four playoff spots in college football or who are baffled by the sport\u2019s inability to concoct another solution, that\u2019s how you need to approach the final few weeks of the regular season. Win and your team remains in the hunt, lose and you\u2019re (probably) done.\n\nAnd because of this, there are several games this weekend with playoff implications, so we\u2019re here to break them down.\n\nNote: No. 12 in the playoff rankings, UCF beat Temple on Thursday night and remains undefeated. But it\u2019s hope for the playoff is still a long shot.\n\nNo. 1/1 Alabama (8-0) at No. 4/4 LSU (7-1)\n\nGame time: 8 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: CBS\n\nGoing into this game, the closest the Crimson Tide has come to losing was its 45-23 win over Texas A&M back in Week 4. With the best offense in the country, Alabama has cruised to victories in every game so far this season, but the Tigers could prove to be the first real test for a couple reasons. LSU is seventh in the country in defense efficiency (Alabama is second), and it\u2019s in a three-way tie at No. 1 for interceptions this season with 14, along with Maryland and Fresno State.\n\nThat\u2019s great for the Tigers and all \u2014 plus a surely wild environment in Death Valley \u2014 but the problem is Alabama quarterback and Heisman Trophy favorite Tua Tagovailoa has thrown 25 touchdown passes so far and not a single interception. He\u2019s averaging more than 13 yards per pass and has a 70.4 completion percentage. Plus, coming off the bye week \u2014 though LSU had the week off too \u2014 Tagovailoa told reporters he has recovered from his knee sprain and is at 100 percent.\n\nLSU is ranked No. 3 in the opening College Football Playoff projections, and an upset over Alabama as a two-touchdown underdog would likely send the Tigers to the SEC championship game. Hypothetically if they won that as well, it would be impossible for the selection committee to deny them a playoff spot. But an in-conference loss Saturday would knock them out of contention.\n\nAlabama is one of the teams that could lose a game this season and still make the playoff, like last year. A loss to LSU would knock the Crimson Tide out of the SEC championship game, but assuming it wins its remaining games against Mississippi State, The Citadel and Auburn, it\u2019s reasonable to think Alabama will make the playoff, along with the conference champion. A win, however, keeps Nick Saban\u2019s team in control of the SEC West and on track to face the winner of this week\u2019s Georgia-Kentucky game. So speaking of\u2026\n\nNo. 6/6 Georgia (7-1) at No. 9/11 Kentucky (7-1)\n\nGame time: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: CBS\n\nAfter Kentucky\u2019s controversial win over Missouri last weekend, the winner of this game will represent the SEC East in the conference championship game. The key for the Wildcats is their defense, which is currently nationally ranked at No. 1 in scoring defense, along with Clemson, and No. 12 in total defense. (Georgia is Nos. 12 and 15, respectively, in those categories.) If Kentucky\u2019s defense can shut down Bulldogs quarterback Jake Fromm and stifle the run game, it will have a good chance at the upset.\n\nBut if the defense can\u2019t stop Georgia, the Wildcats\u2019 offense might not be able to match the Bulldogs\u2019 scoring potential. Georgia\u2019s defense shouldn\u2019t have too much of a problem containing Kentucky\u2019s 101st-ranked offense, and since the Wildcats\u2019 Week 6 overtime loss to Texas A&M, their last two victories have been by eight points combined. Georgia is a 9-point favorite.\n\nDespite each having a loss, Georgia and Kentucky debuted on the College Football Playoff rankings at No. 6 and No. 9 respectively, while the Bulldogs have a 43 percent chance to make the playoff. But because of those losses, the loser of this game is out of the playoff race, as well as the SEC title game. The winner, should it also win the conference championship, would likely make the playoff.\n\nNo. 14/13 Penn State (6-2) at No. 5/5 Michigan (7-1)\n\nGame time: 3:45 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: ESPN\n\nA team with two losses has never made the College Football Playoff, and it doesn\u2019t seem like this Nittany Lions squad is going to be the first to do that. So it\u2019s going for the role of the spoiler more than anything else this weekend. But Penn State hasn\u2019t looked great lately, struggling before eventually putting away Iowa and Indiana most recently and losing to Michigan State and Ohio State before that. Nittany Lions quarterback Trace McSorely is dealing with a knee injury and will play despite not being at 100 percent.\n\nBut Michigan is coming in hot with the No. 1 defense in the country and a seven-game win streak since it\u2019s season-opening loss to Notre Dame. Being at home adds another advantage, as does coming off a bye week, and the Wolverines are a 10.5-point favorite.\n\nAfter Week 9, Michigan has a 37 percent chance to make the playoff and is No. 5 on the initial College Football Playoff rankings. It could move up, depending on the result and score of the Alabama-LSU game, and jump over Georgia in terms of chances if the Bulldogs lose, but that\u2019s all contingent on a victory Saturday. Should Penn State win, that\u2019s probably it for the Wolverines\u2019 playoff hopes.\n\nNo. 7/7 Oklahoma (7-1) at Texas Tech (5-3)\n\nGame time: 8 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: ABC\n\nThe Sooners need a win this weekend to stay on track to get to the Big 12 championship game, and they\u2019re a 13.5-point favorite. They\u2019re also at No. 7 in the playoff rankings and have a 33 percent shot at the playoff still, but they need to win out, including in the conference title game. With that loss earlier this season to Texas, Oklahoma can\u2019t afford another one if it \u2014 and the Big 12 \u2014 want to keep hope alive for a playoff berth.\n\nOklahoma will need some help from the teams ranked higher than it to actually advance to the playoff \u2014 we\u2019re looking at Michigan, Georgia, LSU or even Notre Dame \u2014 but none of that matters if it doesn\u2019t finish the season with one loss.", "Days after Hue Jackson was fired, the former Cleveland Browns coach didn\u2019t go somewhere to contemplate what just happened, what his next move might be or to avoid the world that\u2019s criticized him for years.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s everywhere. He did an exclusive with Cleveland.com and appeared on ESPN\u2019s First Take on Friday morning.\n\nSo what have we learned from the embattled ex-HC? Here are a few of the quotes that say the most about what he\u2019s thinking:\n\n1.\n\nFrom the Cleveland.com interview:\n\n\u201cIn my mind, if we fix the offense \u2014 it\u2019s a totally different story. So I do believe the move was premature. But I think a part of the problem again went back to the first two years.\u2019 \u201cWhat everybody saw the first two years was not a Hue Jackson offense. And the people, players, and coaches that know me know that was the case. I had to do on offense what was necessary to be competitive each week. And we were.\n\n\u201cBut it was recommended I bring in an OC to allow me to focus on leading the organization. In hindsight, it would\u2019ve been in our best interest for me to continue doing what got me the job, and that was to run the offense with more talent on board.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Jackson blaming some failures on not being able to run the offense in the first place. Note that he doesn\u2019t talk about his own failures here.\n\n2.\n\n\u201cWe passed on three franchise QBs the first two years in Wentz, Watson and Mahomes. We played with a QB room with zero wins in the league. We played with street free agents and practice squad players in WRs. Yet our offense was the same or better than what we were doing this year. There is no way that should happen. \u201cYou can\u2019t pass on quarterbacks. You never pass on a potential franchise quarterback because you don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be there in the future. I think Baker Mayfield is going to be a sensational player if they surround him with the right people, but they\u2019ve got to give him help and run a scheme suited to his skill set.\u201d\n\nThis is blame on the front office, pre-John Dorsey.\n\n3.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh, yes. Did I like Carson Wentz? Hell yes. He did something that no other quarterback did. I give them three minutes to memorize the book and put on the (white) board. He put it all on the board in two minutes and 48 seconds. I\u2019ve never had a guy do that ever in my coaching career.\u201d\n\nThis is just a super-cool fact about Wentz that I had to include, but it\u2019s also a reminder that Jackson wished the franchise took its QB of the future earlier than when the Browns selected Baker Mayfield earlier this year.\n\n4.\n\nThere's one big thing Hue Jackson wishes he did differently in Cleveland: pic.twitter.com/z5hkdVVwcw \u2014 First Take (@FirstTake) November 2, 2018\n\n\u201cI think when I look back, first thing, I wouldn\u2019t have given away the offense. That\u2019s what I got hired for. If you\u2019re going out, you go out doing the things you know, that you truly believe in. But again, that was a tough spot. When you\u2019re 1-15, 0-16, and you\u2019re in a situation where there\u2019s been a lot of losing already, it\u2019s tough to make those choices and decisions.\u201d\n\nA little bit softer there \u2014 he now understands how tough it is to run a franchise that\u2019s won one game in two seasons. But he still can\u2019t get over the decision to not run his offense in the first place.\n\n5.\n\nPer Pro Football Talk:\n\n\u201cI still think that there\u2019s another opportunity out there somewhere.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll leave it at that.", "Miami head coach Mark Richt, right, watches from the sidelines during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Boston College in Boston, Friday, Oct. 26, 2018. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) \u2014 There was so much promise for Duke and Miami.\n\nDuke was 4-0 and found its way into the AP Top 25. Miami started the season ranked No. 8, won five of its first six games and looked again to be the team to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coastal Division.\n\nAnd then things went bad \u2014 in a hurry.\n\nThe good times seem long ago for the Blue Devils (5-3, 1-3) and the Hurricanes (5-3, 2-2). Duke has dropped three of its last four games, and Miami has lost two straight to put its hopes of successfully defending the Coastal crown in serious jeopardy.\n\n\"Both teams need a win,\" Miami coach Mark Richt said.\n\nThe Hurricanes are taking plenty of heat from their fan base these days, but if they need some positivity they need to look no further than to Duke coach David Cutcliffe.\n\nHe said Miami is \"probably a football team without a weakness,\" and lauded the Hurricanes' defense as potentially the best in the country.\n\n\"They're as talented as anybody's seen anywhere,\" Cutcliffe said. \"So what we have to do is minimize any errors, which is obvious, and we also have to play at an extremely high level.\"\n\nThe root of Miami's problems right now is its offense, and the struggles there are renewing calls from some fans on social media about Richt's playcalling.\n\nThose concerns about the offense had Richt playing defense.\n\n\"I respond to it in that there's nothing wrong with the plays being called, quite frankly,\" Richt said. \"What's wrong is we haven't executed well enough. If anybody got in the room with us and saw what we were doing and how we're doing it and why we're doing it, if they knew football, they'd know we have to do a better job executing of what we call, quite frankly.\"\n\nDuke's defense forced a total of nine turnovers in its five wins \u2014 and zero in the three losses.\n\n\"It has to become important to everybody in the organization to create turnovers and take care of the football,\" Cutcliffe said.\n\nHere's some of what to know going into Saturday night:\n\nBREAKING POINT\n\nMiami has held the lead for 6.6 percent of the time in its last three games \u2014 all of that coming in the final 11:52 of the massive comeback against Florida State \u2014 and hasn't scored first in any of its last seven games against ACC opponents going back to last season. Out of the 28 quarters in those seven games, Miami has held the end-of-period lead only eight times.\n\nCOMPARING SCORES\n\nComparing scores is a silly method of deciding whether one team should beat another, especially in the Coastal Division. Duke exemplifies why that method is futile. The Blue Devils beat Georgia Tech by 14 and lost to Virginia Tech by 17. So naturally, Georgia Tech beat Virginia Tech by 21 points. The only shared opponent Miami and Duke have so far this season is Virginia; the Hurricanes lost to the Cavaliers by three, the Blue Devils lost by 14.\n\nFIRST TO 20\n\nThe magic number on Saturday might be 20. Miami is 5-0 when it scores 20 points or more, 0-3 when it does not. Duke is 5-1 when it scores 20 or more, 0-2 when it does not.\n\nRIGHT AT HOME\n\nMiami has won its last eight ACC home games, by far the Hurricanes' best such streak since entering the conference in 2004. Before this current run started in 2016, Miami \u2014 somewhat unbelievably \u2014 had never won more than three consecutive ACC home contests. Miami actually started 17-18 in its first 35 ACC home games, and has gone 17-6 in those games since. Duke hasn't won at Miami since 1976, losing its last six trips.\n\nIT ALL CHANGED\n\nThe third anniversary of Miami's eight-lateral, shouldn't-have-counted kickoff return for a touchdown to beat Duke in 2015 was this week. Fortunes seemed to change on that play. Duke had won 25 of 34 games (.735) going into that game and has gone 18-21 (.462) since. Miami had won 22 of its last 40 games (.550) before that night in Durham, North Carolina, and has gone 28-12 (.700) since.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joedy McCreary in Durham, North Carolina contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Tennessee insists it isn't dwelling on its blown lead from a week ago or looking ahead as it takes a break from Southeastern Conference competition to face Conference USA program Charlotte.\n\nThere's too much at stake.\n\nAfter squandering a 21-9 second-half lead in a 27-24 loss at South Carolina last week, Tennessee must win three of its last four games to become bowl eligible .\n\n\"We've just got to focus on our game plan this week and focus on Charlotte,\" Tennessee linebacker Daniel Bituli said. \"They're a really good team. If we were to focus on these upcoming games, it would really derail us.\"\n\nTennessee (3-5) has done a good job of avoiding these types of pitfalls against Group of Five teams. The Vols have won their last 29 home games against teams that aren't part of the Power Five.\n\nCharlotte owns a 4-4 record this season after going 1-11 a year ago. Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt says his team won't take this 21-point underdog lightly.\n\n\"If somebody's looking at it that way, they're not ready to play,\" Pruitt said. \"These guys have a better record than we do. If you look at them statistically, they're better than us in probably every statistical category. They have 85 guys on scholarship just like we do. We'll have to be at our best to give ourselves a chance to have success Saturday.\"\n\nTennessee gets the opportunity Saturday to work on its rushing offense and run defense - two areas that have proved troublesome this season.\n\nThe Vols rank last in the SEC in yards rushing per game (141.1) and yards per carry (3.6). They also are 11th in rushing yards allowed per game (169.8) and are 13th in yards allowed per carry (4.8).\n\nCharlotte's task is to avoid getting intimidated by a setting unlike anything the 49ers have encountered before.\n\n\"You can't let the environment affect you,\" Charlotte coach Brad Lambert said. \"It's hard because it's so big. We've been to Louisville (in 2016). We've been to Kentucky (in 2015). We went to Kansas State (in 2017), which is extremely loud. But they aren't necessarily as big a stadium as this. This will be the biggest stadium by far that our kids have played in. It will be kind of a shock to them, I'm sure, when they walk in.\"\n\nHere are some other things to watch Saturday when Tennessee hosts Charlotte.\n\nPREMIER PICKER\n\nCharlotte linebacker Juwan Foggie has a school-record six interceptions to lead all Football Bowl Subdivision players , and he's scored on two interception returns. He will try to get a seventh interception against Tennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano, who hasn't been picked off in his last 105 attempts. Guarantano has thrown only two interceptions all season.\n\nBIG RECEIVERS\n\nLambert says he's concerned by the size of Tennessee receivers Marquez Callaway and Jauan Jennings. The 6-foot-2 Callaway has 27 catches for 372 yards. Jennings is 6-3 and has 26 receptions for 335 yards and three touchdowns. Charlotte's starting cornerbacks are 5-11 D.J. Anderson and 5-9 Nafees Lyon.\n\nFORMER HURRICANE\n\nCharlotte quarterback Evan Shirreffs is a graduate transfer from Miami. Shirreffs will be making his third start since taking over for Chris Reynolds, who underwent season-ending ankle surgery last month.\n\nON THE RUN\n\nSEC teams generally enjoy major physical advantages in matchups with Conference USA teams, but Charlotte's stats suggest the Vols may not be able to run wild this week. Charlotte is ranked sixth among all FBS teams in run defense and is allowing 3.1 yards per carry and 89.8 yards rushing per game.\n\nWATCH OUT FOR LeMAY\n\nCharlotte running back Benny LeMay has rushed for 745 yards while averaging 5.3 yards per carry. He also has 16 catches for 226 yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But her supporters worry that a succession of controversies surrounding the vote \u2013 a new \"exact match\" voting law, a mass removal of inactive voters from the state rolls, and reports that some machines are switching Abrams votes to Kemp \u2013 could discourage minority and first-time voters from turning out.\n\nKemp, who as secretary of state is Georgia's top elections official, says every legitimate voter's ballot will be counted.\n\nAbrams, appearing on Comedy Central's Daily Show in August, called Kemp \"a remarkable architect of voter suppression.\"\n\nCLOSE Oprah talks at town hall in support of Stacey Abrams as Georgia's next Governor.

He said Abrams is using a timeworn strategy employed by Democrats \u201cto widely publicize a fear that someone is trying to take away your right to vote.\"\n\nBullock says he doesn't believe Kemp's office is suppressing the vote. But he says complaints by Democrats will likely spur black and minority turnout.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to have a mobilizing effect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may bring to the polls some individual who otherwise wasn\u2019t that interested in voting, just to demonstrate that they do have this right, and they are going to protect their right.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Vice President Mike Pence was vying for the spotlight in Georgia while campaigning for gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp at the same time Oprah and Will Ferrell were in town to support Kemp's opposer, Stacey Abrams. USA TODAY\n\nAbrams and voting rights groups have accused Kemp of using his office to suppress votes and tilt the election.\n\nKemp rejects the charge. His campaign spokesman told USA Today that Kemp has made it \"easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia.\"\n\n\"Any accusations to the contrary are absolutely baseless,\" spokesman Cody Hall said. \"Right now, we have more people on the voting rolls than ever before. That's because of online voter registration championed by Brian Kemp. We also have record turnout for early voting.\"\n\nGeorgia's 2018 election is the first under the state's exact match law, which requires voter registration applications to precisely match information on file with the state's motor vehicle department or the Social Security Administration.\n\nThose voters whose names don't match exactly are placed on a \"pending\" list for further scrutiny.\n\nThe law was approved by the Republican-led legislature in 2017 and signed by Republican Gov. Nathan Deal. Kemp's office enforces it.\n\nCritics say exact match laws affect black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters disproportionately, because they are more likely to haveethnic names that produce more errors when entered into databases.

He has described litigation as the work of \"liberal activist groups.\"\n\n\u201cDespite what my friends at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee claim, federal and state law clearly authorize Georgia\u2019s matching process for new registrants, and the 11th Circuit has already ruled in favor of a similar law in Florida,\" Kemp said in August. \"Not a single voter whose status is pending for failure to verify will get rejected this election cycle.\"\n\nKemp has also been criticized for canceling millions of inactive voter registrations in recent years.\n\nHis office says it's conducting \"maintenance of the voter rolls to ensure election integrity.\"\n\nAbrams' supporters celebrated progress last week when a federal judge blocked Georgia from throwing out absentee ballots and applications because signatures didn't match, and again on Friday, when a judge allowed voters who are flagged inaccurately as non-citizens to vote when they provide proof of citizenship to poll workers.\n\nThe Georgia NAACP last week filed complaints with state election officials alleging that some voting machines in two counties mistakenly showed votes cast for Abrams registering for Kemp.\n\nA spokesman for the state's Democratic Party accused Kemp of \"creating a culture of fear\" around voting.

(AP) \u2014 Florida State started the year with optimism from the arrival of a new coach and a national ranking, while North Carolina State earned its own spot in the AP Top 25 after a 5-0 start.\n\nNow both the Seminoles and Wolfpack are trying to regroup from confidence-dinging losses entering Saturday's game.\n\nThe Seminoles (4-4, 2-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) arrive in Raleigh after a 59-10 loss to No. 2 Clemson, an ugly loss on several levels: It was the program's worst at Doak Campbell Stadium and the questions about effort and discipline that lingered afterward.\n\nFlorida State's leading receiver Nyqwan Murray and reserve linebacker Zaquandre White are suspended for the first half of Saturday's game against the Wolfpack (5-2, 2-2) after throwing punches at Clemson players in separate incidents during the loss. There's also uncertainty at quarterback, where the status of every-game starter Deondre Francois is in question after getting banged up against Clemson.\n\nFirst-year FSU coach Willie Taggart hasn't specified the nature of Francois' injury, other than to say he thought he hit his head on the ground during the Clemson game. James Blackman, who took over as the starter in 2017 after Francois was injured in the season opener, got at least some first-team reps in practice while Francois did little during open sessions of practice.\n\n\"You guys didn't see him do anything, but he's still day to day,\" Taggart said.\n\nFlorida State hasn't had a losing season since 1976 and has played in a bowl game every season since 1982. A loss at N.C. State, where the Seminoles have won two straight meetings, will put those streaks in jeopardy with No. 3 Notre Dame, No. 13 Florida and No. 24 Boston College still on the schedule.\n\nN.C. State suffered its own lopsided loss to the Tigers, a 41-7 road loss on Oct. 20. The Wolfpack then lost at Syracuse 51-41, a two-game stretch that exposed weaknesses in a defense that had gotten off to a good start in overcoming the loss to veteran talent to the NFL.\n\n\"I think we've beaten two really good ACC teams and we've lost to two good ACC team,\" Wolfpack coach Dave Doeren said. \"Now we've got five games left. ... And at the end of the year, you can look back and be proud of what you've accomplished or disappointed. You don't want regret.\"\n\nYet the Wolfpack still can pursue the program's second 10-win season, the other coming in 2002 with a program-record 11 wins.\n\nHere are some other things to know about Saturday's FSU-N.C. State game:\n\nINJURY QUESTIONS\n\nN.C. State missed injured key players last week, including starting offensive tackle Justin Witt, starting cornerback Nick McCloud and No. 2 running back Ricky Person Jr. Doeren expressed confidence Monday that they would all be back this week, though he was noncommittal on their status after Thursday's practice.\n\nSTOPPING HARMON\n\nWolfpack receiver Kelvin Harmon is an NFL prospect with the size and skill to make contested catches . Like the rest of the Wolfpack, he had a bad game at Clemson, then came back with 11 catches for 247 yards \u2014 the No. 2 single-game total in program history \u2014 and two touchdowns against the Orange. If Harmon gets in a groove with quarterback Ryan Finley again, FSU's defense could have a tough time getting off the field.\n\nLOST PRODUCTION\n\nMurray has 40 catches for 536 yards and three touchdowns, so the Seminoles will miss him as a threat for the first half. \"I would say it's an opportunity,\" receiver D.J. Matthews said.\n\nGROUND GAME\n\nN.C. State could help itself by getting its rushing attack going again. The Wolfpack's rushing total had increased for the first five games to a season-high 225 yards against Boston College, but the production has fallen off with 104 yards against Clemson and 68 yards against Syracuse. While Reggie Gallaspy has run for touchdowns in two straight games, North Carolina State missed Person's big-play potential .\n\nBURNS' PRESSURE\n\nFlorida State defensive end Brian Burns is tied for the ACC lead with nine sacks to lead a pass rush that ranks 15th in the Bowl Subdivision ranks by averaging 3.13 sacks per game. The Wolfpack will have to keep Burns away from Finley.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bob Ferrante in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

North Carolina has been close \u2014 but that's not good enough for the Tar Heels.\n\nThe surging Yellow Jackets visit the Tar Heels on Saturday looking to move closer to bowl eligibility and keep alive their longshot hopes in their topsy-turvy division race.\n\nGeorgia Tech (4-4, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) has won three of four to move back to .500 after a 1-3 start that put some pressure the Yellow Jackets. Their famed triple-option offense ran all over Virginia Tech last week, rolling up 465 yards rushing in a 49-28 rout of the Hokies.\n\n\"We've got a lot to play for,\" coach Paul Johnson said. \"We're still alive in the conference. We're trying to play to get bowl eligible. There's a ton to play for.\"\n\nFor North Carolina (1-6, 1-4), there's no more margin of error. In order to earn bowl eligibility for the first time since 2016, the Tar Heels must win their remaining four games \u2014 then find a replacement for the game with UCF that was canceled because of Hurricane Michael, and win that one, too.\n\nThey've been close lately, but haven't been able to close out a victory in more than a month.\n\nSince their 37-point loss at Miami, they've lost twice by three points apiece \u2014 once in overtime at Syracuse, another when Virginia Tech scored the winning touchdown with 19 seconds left following a critical fumble.\n\nCoach Larry Fedora acknowledged that there's \"plenty of frustration.\n\n\"We talk about it as a team. We talk about how close we are and the difference between winning and losing and what we need to do,\" Fedora said. \"Nobody's happy with what's going on. Everybody's searching, and everybody's looking at me. I'm the leader of this team, and ... I'm responsible for giving them answers.\"\n\nSome other things to watch when Georgia Tech visits North Carolina on Saturday:\n\nROTATING QBS\n\nJohnson says senior captain TaQuon Marshall will start at quarterback while Tobias Oliver also will play after putting up big numbers against the Hokies. Oliver rushed for three touchdowns in his first start at QB. \"It doesn't change the game plan,\" Johnson said. \"Tobias has played well whenever he has gone in. I think he has played in every game and he'll play Saturday at some point. It doesn't really change. We don't change a whole lot of what we do depending on who's at quarterback.\"\n\nNO PASS\n\nGeorgia Tech's only pass attempt against Virginia Tech was an incompletion by Oliver. It was the first time since Nov. 26, 1977, when the Yellow Jackets beat Georgia 16-7, that they did not complete a pass. It was the 18th time since 2002 that a FBS had no completions and those teams that did it were 14-4.\n\nFORCED TURNOVERS ON THE RISE\n\nFirst-year defensive coordinator Nate Woody has produced more forced turnovers for Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets have forced 17 turnovers this season, including nine interceptions. Their 2017 total through 11 games was only 10. \"There are games we've played better than some other games,\" Johnson said of the adjustment to Woody's 3-4 scheme. \"I think overall what we're doing is sound and I think it's repetition and the more they do it the better they'll get at it.\"\n\nOFFENSIVE PLAY\n\nUNC's offense had largely been a mess entering its open date, but the Tar Heels have moved the ball more effectively the past three weeks. They had a season-high 522 yards against Virginia Tech, then had 500 more against Syracuse before sputtering for much of the second half at Virginia. And quarterback Nathan Elliott has four touchdowns with no interceptions in the past two games.\n\nSLIDING\n\nThe Tar Heels are in the midst of a major slide that began in the final month of the 2016 season. That team was ranked 15thin the AP Top 25 and had won 18 of 22 games, including a 13-2 record against ACC teams, entering a trip to Duke. But dating to that loss, North Carolina has lost 13 of 18 games and gone 2-13 against league opponents.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in what Pompeo says must be \"substantive consultations\" in November in a third country. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) ORG XMIT: WX108 (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Trump administration announced Friday the snapback of crippling economic sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil, banking, shipping and other sectors \u2013 reimposing penalties lifted by the Obama administration as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\nThe White House hopes the sanctions \u2013 set to go into effect Monday and aimed at more than 700 Iranian individuals and entities \u2013 will strangle Iran\u2019s economy and force the regime into a new round of negotiations.\n\nThe U.S. wants Iran to curb its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism, among other steps. Iran's leaders have said they are not interested in talks with the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to compel Iran to permanently abandon its well-documented outlaw activities and behave as a normal country,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters Friday in a conference call previewing the Nov. 4 sanctions. The U.S. penalties will hit foreign countries and companies that do business with the targeted Iranian entities, including its national oil company, its banks and its shipping industry.\n\nCritics say the move will hurt the Iranian people, not the regime, at a time when its economy is already reeling from a drop in the value of its currency and other problems.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions are a slap in the face to the Iranian people who have been squeezed between the repression of their government and the pressure of international sanctions for decades,\u201d Jamal Abdi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said in a statement ahead of Pompeo\u2019s announcement. \u201cImpoverishing ordinary Iranians will not hurt the regime or achieve any of America\u2019s security interests, but it will set back the Iranian people\u2019s aspirations for years to come.\u201d\n\nBrian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran, said the U.S. has asked Saudi Arabia to increase its production of oil \u201cwhile we take off Iranian oil from the market.\u201d\n\nThat will help prevent a global spike in the price of oil, which would end up helping Iran. The Trump administration\u2019s strategy \u2013 relying on Saudi Arabia to squeeze Iran \u2013 illustrates why the White House has tread carefully in its response to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey.\n\nAsked how the Trump administration could square its condemnation of Iran\u2019s human rights abuses with its support for Saudi Arabia, which also has an abysmal record on that front, Hook said: \u201cI can only speak to how the Saudis have helped our Iran strategy.\u201d\n\nThe Nov. 4 sanctions stem from President Donald Trump\u2019s decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear agreement, negotiated by the U.S. and five other nations. Under that Obama-era agreement, Iran agreed not to pursue nuclear weapons and agreed to inspections of its military sites and other facilities. In exchange, the United States and its partners, including Germany, France, China and Russia \u2013 lifted global sanctions that had devastated Iran's economy.\n\nIran\u2019s leaders have said they will continue to adhere to the agreement despite America's exit. Other signatories to the accord are trying to salvage it \u2013 with the European Union seeking to create a work-around to avoid the U.S. sanctions and continue doing business with Iran.\n\nIn a joint statement, the foreign and finance ministers of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom noted that 12 consecutive reports from an independent watchdog have documented Iran's compliance withe nuclear agreement. And they said they would continue to do business with the regime.\n\n\"It is our aim to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran,\" the ministers said in their statement.\n\nCLOSE Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has announced that the U.S. is canceling a 1955 treaty with Iran establishing economic relations and consular rights between the two nations. (Oct. 3) AP\n\nPompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the EU\u2019s proposed loophole will not work \u2013 and warned that the Trump administration will go after any entity trying to dodge the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cAny financial institution, company or individual who evades our sanctions risks losing access to the U.S. financial system and the ability to do business with the United States or U.S. companies,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters in Friday\u2019s call. \u201cWe are intent on ensuring that global funds stop flowing to coffers of the Iranian regime.\u201d\n\nStill, Pompeo said the administration will offer some as-yet-unspecified exemptions. The Trump administration has been lobbying more than a dozen countries around the world, including India, Japan, Greece and Turkey, to wean themselves from Iranian oil. Oil is Iran\u2019s main source of revenue.\n\nMore: 'Sanctions are Coming:' Trump warns Iran in tweet with nod to 'Game of Thrones'\n\nPompeo said eight countries, which he declined to name, were cooperating with the administration on its push to move to \u201czero\u201d oil imports from Iran. Those countries will earn temporary exemptions when the sanctions go into effect on Sunday night, Pompeo said.\n\nHe and Mnuchin said the full list of exemptions \u2013 and the full list of targeted Iranian entities \u2013 would be released on Monday. There will also be some exemptions for food, medicine and other humanitarian goods, Pompeo said.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the sanctions were too lenient, criticizing the administration for not shutting Iran out of an international financial messaging system known as Swift. He also said the White House should not have allowed any waivers, including one reportedly offered to China.\n\n\"Sanctions waivers being given to key purchasers of Iranian oil, most alarmingly China, give Iran a financial reprieve, and should be eliminated as soon as possible,\" Rubio said.\n\nMnuchin and Pompeo dismissed such comments and said there would be no wiggle room for side deals with Iran.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that our sanctions will be incredibly effective,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe Iranian economy today is already feeling the effects of this \u2026 because the world and Iran knew this was coming.\u201d\n\nMore: Iran, China, S.

(Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe NHL trade deadline is almost four months away and yet there\u2019s considerable trade chatter around the NHL. Here are potential trade targets and whether it makes sense for them to be dealt now:\n\nForward William Nylander, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nDeal: The stalemated contract talks with Nylander are only part of the story. After giving John Tavares $11 million per season last summer, the Maple Leafs are looking at giving Auston Matthews a richer deal. Mitch Marner also is looking at a big payday. Even if they can negotiate a bridge deal with Nylander, and that could be wishful thinking, general manager Kyle Dubas has salary cap issues ahead. Plus, the next negotiation with Nylander is not going to be any easier. Dubas undoubtedly is looking at whether he could add a proven defenseman, with some cost certainty, in a deal for Nylander. The defenseman-rich Carolina Hurricanes could be a good fit for a Nylander trade.\n\nRight wing Wayne Simmonds, Philadelphia Flyers\n\nNo deal: Although Simmonds is a potential summer unrestricted free agent, it doesn\u2019t make sense to trade him now. The Flyers have endured a bumpy start and can\u2019t afford to move Simmonds, who leads them with seven goals. This should be a playoff team. Let\u2019s see where the Flyers are in February before making a decision on Simmonds.\n\nGoalie Sergei Bobrovsky, Columbus Blue Jackets\n\nDeal: It\u2019s clear Bobrovsky is leaving the Blue Jackets after the season, and the Blue Jackets are already preparing as if Joonas Korpisalo will be their No. 1 next season. It would seem like an easy decision to move Bobrovsky now. The problem is the Blue Jackets desperately need to make the playoffs, and Bobrovsky is still a premium netminder. But if the Blue Jackets sincerely believe in Korpisalo, they should trade Bobrovsky now. If they can land a player who can help them now, why not trade him and start the Korpisalo era.\n\nRight wing Artemi Panarin, Blue Jackets\n\nNo deal: Like Bobrovsky, Panarin is expected to leave July 1 as a free agent. But they can\u2019t trade him now. He\u2019s the catalyst of their offense. He has 15 points in 11 games. You ride Panarin as long as you can. The Blue Jackets would still receive a strong return if they trade Panarin in February.\n\nMORE: Montreal Canadiens set NHL record with 2 goals in 2 seconds vs. Washington Capitals\n\nMORE: From pucks to pot: Could NHL be a leader in marijuana policy?\n\nCenter Kevin Hayes, New York Rangers\n\nDeal: The Rangers announced late last season they are in rebuilding mode, and Hayes will be a UFA on July 1. They are not going to re-sign him. Why wouldn\u2019t they trade this big center/forward to add a prospect? It also opens up playing time for younger players.\n\nDefenseman Tyler Myers, Winnipeg Jets\n\nNo deal: As a pending free agent, Myers will be on potential trade lists. But the Jets can\u2019t move him. They are a contender, and he\u2019s their No. 4 defenseman, playing 18:12 per game. This is a team looking to make a postseason run, not fretting about whether they can get a return on Myers before he leaves.\n\nRight wing: Mats Zuccarello, Rangers\n\nDeal: The only issue is that Zuccarello is a popular Rangers player, but he would have considerable trade value. He is producing this season, 10 points in 13 games. Some team may overpay to add his offensive touch.\n\nCenter Matt Duchene, Ottawa Senators\n\nNo deal: Yes, he\u2019s going to be a UFA. But the emphasis should be on proving to Duchene that he should re-sign with the Senators. At 5-5-2, the Senators are better than expected.", "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark.

Sean McVay already owns one NFL Coach of the Year award.\n\nHere are some lesser-known names that are also a big part of why the Los Angeles Rams are 8-0 this season: Andrew Whitworth, Rodger Saffold, John Sullivan, Austin Blythe and Rob Havenstein.\n\nThey are the five guys who are opening running lanes for Gurley, do their best to keep Goff's jersey clean, make McVay's play designs work \u2014 and were an overwhelming pick as the NFL's top offensive line in voting by a panel of 10 football writers for The Associated Press.\n\nThe Rams got eight first-place votes and finished with a total of 92 of a possible 100 points in balloting released Friday.\n\n\"It's no coincidence that arguably the NFL's best and most dynamic offense has the league's top offensive line leading the way, with big boys up front such as left tackle Andrew Whitworth and left guard Rodger Saffold,\" New York-based AP voter Dennis Waszak Jr. said.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints finished second with 76 points, followed by the Pittsburgh Steelers with 73. Then there was a big drop-off, with the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs tied for fourth with 47.\n\nThe Steelers and Eagles each received one of the remaining first-place votes.\n\nA total of 20 teams were named on at least one ballot. The Rams, Saints and Steelers were the only offensive lines that appeared on every ballot.\n\nThe AP voters looked at each line as a unit.\n\nWhitworth, a first-team All-Pro pick last season, has \"been the anchor\" for the Rams up front, said AP voter Rob Maaddi, who is based in Philadelphia.\n\nSaffold made the All-Pro second team. Otherwise, LA's linemen might not necessarily be among the highest-rated at their positions, but they work together so well.\n\n\"I believe that it's a case where these guys understand what we're trying to get done. ... They have a better understanding of what's happening, and where the quarterback is in pass-protection downs, and what the runner's intent is in the running game,\" Rams offensive line coach Aaron Kromer said. \"I think when everybody does that, then you have a chance to \u2014 whoever's grading \u2014 grade out better than you think.\"\n\nOne key has been continuity.\n\nThe Rams employed the same starting five for 15 games last season \u2014 including Whitworth at left tackle, Saffold at left guard, Sullivan at center, and Havenstein at right tackle \u2014 before resting everybody in Week 17. And, plugging in Blythe for the suspended Jamon Brown at right guard to begin this season, they have used the same starting O-line in every game so far.\n\nUnder McVay's guidance, the team currently ranks second in points per game at 33, second in yards per game at 442.6 and first in rushing yards at 150.9.\n\nGurley's excellence helps, of course. But he also has had help from Whitworth and Co. along the way to leading the NFL in rushing with 800 yards and in touchdowns with 15, 11 on the ground.\n\nThe Saints' line has the benefit of playing in front of some stars, too.\n\n\"Yes, Drew Brees makes everyone around him better,\" Nashville-based voter Teresa M. Walker said. \"But the Saints have allowed both a league-low nine sacks and the fewest quarterback hits with 22. They also have an NFL-high 12 TDs rushing.\"\n\nAnd the best argument for rating the Steelers' line among the elite might very well be noting who has not been in uniform for them this season: running back Le'Veon Bell.\n\nWhile he has been sitting out, backup James Conner has been superb, topping AFC runners with 599 yards and scoring nine touchdowns, taking advantage of space created by the likes of David DeCastro and Maurkice Pouncey.\n\nAs Maaddi explained: \"They've helped James Conner put up Le'Veon Bell numbers.

The Wildcats (3-5, 1-4) are coming off a 51-14 loss at Oklahoma that was their fourth loss in five games.\n\nBoth TCU and K-State have to win at least three of their last four games just to be bowl eligible. That means one of them is going to have to win its last three games to get to six wins.\n\n\"What happened in Norman is tough to shake off,\" Wildcats center Adam Holtorf said. \"There definitely is some anger and frustration in what happened. We didn't execute, we didn't compete, it was a tough loss to take.

Every loss, there's no good loss.\"\n\nBOWLING STREAK\n\nKansas State is going to have to finish strong to make a bowl game for the ninth consecutive season. After TCU, the Wildcats have consecutive home games against Kansas and Texas Tech before finishing the regular season at Iowa State.\n\n\"I'd like to think they want to succeed,\" said Bill Snyder, K-State's 79-year-old coach. \"It's not just about playing in a bowl game, they certainly want that. ... None of them have ever been without a bowl game on their resume in any given year, so it would be a unique experience for them. Above and beyond that, they want to be a competitive football team.\"\n\nHURTING FROGS\n\nPatterson said two key defenders, free safety Niko Small and linebacker/end Ty Summers, are likely out for the Kansas State game \u2014 and possibly longer.\n\n\"Maybe down the rest of the year, depending on how it all works,\" Patterson said, without getting specific about their injuries.\n\nSummers has started 32 career games, the most on the team. Small's 28 are the second-most. Starting cornerbacks Jeff Gladney and Julius Lewis struggled while trying to play through unspecified injuries against Kansas, but Patterson said they are better this week.\n\nRUNNING WILDCATS\n\nKansas State has averaged 250 yards rushing and run for 10 touchdowns in the past three games. Alex Barnes is second in the Big 12 with 102 yards rushing per game and a league-best nine rushing scores even after being held to 28 yards on 13 carries by Oklahoma.\n\n\"He's not the only guy on the field,\" Snyder said. \"There's a whole bunch of people out there and they have to block people.\"\n\nSUNFLOWER STATE TIES\n\nPatterson was born in Larned, Kansas, and grew up in the state. He went to Pawnee Heights High School and then Dodge City Community College before K-State, where he played linebacker and safety in 1980 and 1981, and then was a student assistant coach. This is only the 12th meeting between these two schools.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That is a game Houston certainly remembers.\n\nThe No. 17 Cougars (7-1, 4-0 American) are ranked again just in time for their trip north to Dallas to play SMU (3-5, 2-2) on Saturday night.\n\n\"We're all on the same page because we haven't won anything. These are just rankings,\" second-year Houston coach Major Applewhite said. \"These are the entertainment dollars right now; these aren't real. This is what people want to get involved with, talk about, like and retweet, but it doesn't matter.\"\n\nHigh-scoring Houston, which has won five in a row, is instead focused on trying to get another step closer to claiming a spot in the American Athletic Conference championship game.\n\nWith quarterback D'Eriq King accounting for 39 touchdowns (28 passing, 11 rushing), the Cougars have scored more than 40 points in all eight games this season \u2014 a school record and the nation's longest active streak. They shot into the Top 25 after a 21-point win at previously undefeated USF last week.\n\nThis is the first time the Cougars have been in the Top 25 under Applewhite. They went to SMU two years ago when Tom Herman was still their coach, and a 38-16 loss dropped them all of the way out of the AP poll from 11th. They got ranked once more that season, only to lose again.\n\nSMU has lost 18 of its last 19 games against ranked teams. The Mustangs have lost all six since that win over Houston two years ago by an average margin of three touchdowns.\n\nSince an 0-3 start in coach Sonny Dykes' first season, the Mustangs have won three of five. The losses in that span were to still-undefeated UCF and last week at home to Cincinnati, which forced overtime with a last-second field goal and then won on an interception returned for a touchdown.\n\nOLIVER'S KNEE\n\nCougars star defensive tackle Ed Oliver missed last week's game with a bruised right knee, and it was unclear if the 6-foot-3, 292-pound anticipated high NFL draft pick would play against SMU.\n\n\"It's up to Ed and the doctors,\" Applewhite said. \"We prep these guys, and trust our doctors and the young man to tell us how he feels. We work our plans around it.\"\n\nHICKS PICKS\n\nHicks has thrown only four interceptions this season. All four of them have been returned for touchdowns, including Cincinnati's game-winner. After Bearcats safety James Wiggins' pick-six last week, Dykes had a different response than he did earlier this season when Hicks was replaced by true freshman William Brown.\n\n\"Every situation is different,\" Dykes said. \"In overtime, trying to convert on third down, you're more inclined to throw the ball into a tight window.\"\n\nMAJOR AND HICKS\n\nAfter initially committing to Houston and planning to enroll there in January 2015, Hicks switched to SMU. Applewhite became Houston's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach that same month, and tried to get Hicks to Houston.\n\n\"I had about two days to recruit him and keep him here, but he had already had SMU sheets and everything,\" Applewhite said this week. \"I love the way he plays. He is a tough guy, quarterback, competitor, can make a lot of throws, and he has given us fits before.\"\n\nHicks threw three TDs and ran for another in that win over Houston two years ago.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nSMU has only 142 yards rushing the past three games and dropped to 123rd out of 129 FBS teams with its 98.6 yards rushing per game. \"When half your offense isn't very productive, you've got to figure out a way to fix it. We've been trying, and we'll continue to try,\" Dykes said. ... Houston is the worst among FBS teams, allowing 325 yards passing per game. ...

Drug traffickers are disguising opioids as counterfeit prescriptions, in a marketing strategy, the report said.\n\n\u201cThis report underscores the scope and magnitude of the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States,\u201d Acting DEA Administrator Uttam Dhillon said in a statement.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said the report confirmed that transnational drug cartels and foreign drug labs working with street gangs are flooding communities with heroin, fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamines.\n\nWhile the 164-page DEA report covered statistics mostly through 2016, preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that overdose deaths began to decline last year, with opioid prescriptions falling significantly, he said.\n\n\"We also saw an actual decline in homicides and violent crimes in 2017 after increases in 2015 and 2016,\" Sessions said.\n\nThe DEA's National Drug Threat Assessment outlined the dangers posed to the U.S. by domestic and international drug trafficking, and by the abuse of illicit drugs.

(AP) \u2014 No need to remind No. 3 Notre Dame.\n\nThe Fighting Irish remember what happened last season when they were rolling along with their sights set on the playoffs. They're out to avoid a repeat.\n\nNotre Dame looks to remain unbeaten and in line for a playoff berth when it visits Northwestern on Saturday night.\n\n\"We just need to be focused on the right things on and off the field,\" receiver Miles Boykin said. \"That's what we learned from last year.\"\n\nThe Irish (8-0) are off to their best start since the 2012 team went undefeated all the way until a lopsided loss to Alabama in the BCS championship game. When the College Football Playoff rankings came out this week, they were No. 4.\n\nAs good as that all sounds, Notre Dame found itself in a similar spot a year ago. And things didn't go the way the Irish wanted after that.\n\nThey were No. 3 in the first two playoff rankings en route to an 8-1 start, only to go 2-2 the rest of the way \u2014 starting with a blowout loss to Miami. Now, they're one of four remaining unbeaten FBS teams along with No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 Clemson and No. 9 Central Florida.\n\n\"I think we just deviated from our process, looking too far into the future,\" center Sam Mustipher said of 2017. \"I am sure last year at this time we were saying, 'We're focused on now, this is what we're doing.' But I remember last year when the first playoff rankings came out, we had the TVs and everyone was watching. We were sending out tweets and videos of what we came in at.\"\n\nBut this year?\n\n\"It's not like that because we know the only ranking that matters is the last one,\" Mustipher said.\n\nNotre Dame has won its first eight games for the 10th time in the past 68 years. Three of those teams (1966, 1973 and 1988) won championships, and if they are going to stay in the running, they can't afford to stumble against Northwestern.\n\nThe Wildcats (5-3) have won four in a row since a three-game slide to grab the lead in the Big Ten West. They're stepping out of conference play at an unusual time to take on one of the top teams in the nation.\n\n\"What a great opportunity,\" coach Pat Fitzgerald said. \"We've got nothing to lose so our guys are gonna, I think, prepare really well. And I think they're gonna be excited for the challenge.\"\n\nROLLING 'CATS\n\nNorthwestern is coming off a 31-17 victory over short-handed Wisconsin and leads the Badgers, Purdue and Iowa by 1 1/2 games in the Big Ten West. Though this week's matchup won't impact the division standings, a win would still be huge for the Wildcats. They haven't beaten a top-five opponent since the 1959 team opened with victories over No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 5 Iowa. Northwestern's coach back then? Ara Parseghian, who went on to lead Notre Dame to two national championships.\n\nBOOK IT\n\nNotre Dame quarterback Ian Book has been on quite a roll since he replaced Brandon Wimbush. He's 5-0 as the starter and leads all FBS quarterbacks with a 76.5 completion percentage in his six games. Book was particularly good in last week's 44-22 rout of Navy in San Diego, completing 27 of 33 passes for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nIMPRESSIVE RUN\n\nFreshman Isaiah Bowser appears to be settling in as the Wildcats' No. 1 running back with back-to-back 100-yard games. He has run for 225 yards and his first three touchdowns the past two weeks after getting just two yards on two attempts in his first three games. He followed up a breakout outing against Rutgers with 117 yards and a TD against Wisconsin. The Wildcats struggled running the ball for a few weeks after Jeremy Larkin was forced to stop playing football because of a spinal issue. He ran for 346 and five touchdowns in three games before retiring.\n\nCATCHING ON\n\nBoykin seems to have benefited from the quarterback change at Notre Dame. The 6-foot-4 senior has 28 catches for 409 yards and six touchdowns with Book starting the past five games. He figures to be challenged by cornerback Montre Hartage, who has just one interception but 12 pass breakups.\n\nSERIES SPEAKING\n\nThough they have a 37-9-2 edge in a series that dates to 1889, the Irish have dropped the past two games to the Wildcats, both at home. Northwestern beat Notre Dame 43-40 on Nov. 11, 2014, and 17-15 on Sept. 2, 1995, when Fitzgerald was a star linebacker for the Wildcats. This is the first trip to Evanston for the Irish since a 48-0 romp on Sept. 25, 1976. And they're the first top-three team to visit Ryan Field since No. 1 Ohio State in 2006.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nThe final season of Netflix's \"House of Cards\" debuts with Robin Wright as Claire Underwood, the new President of the United States after her husband's resignation from the position. \"House\" is just one of the many series that examines the drama and comedy surrounding politicians in power. Here are a few more of our favorite political television shows. (Photo: David Giesbrecht, Netflix)\n\nNetflix is dead. Long live Netflix.\n\nThis weekend marks the end of an era for the omnipresent streaming service, with the debut of the final season of \"House of Cards.\"\n\nCanceling \"Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" (its seventh and final season is due in 2019) officially closes the streaming service's first chapter of programming, five years after it began. It was a time when the TV sky seemed limitless \u2013 no shows seemed to get canceled, old favorites were constantly being saved and streaming was a playground for writers and directors to experiment. And always, at least on the outside, it seemed to work.\n\nIt was an era when Netflix sought a handful of high-quality, high-talent series to lure new subscribers. It was the era when the Kyle Chandler-starring \"Bloodline\" and the Wachowski sibling extravaganza \"Sense8\" were among the service's top offerings because of their pedigrees alone (both series eventually were canceled in early seasons). It was a time when we thought Netflix was just trying to become HBO.\n\nBut that was 2013. And maybe 2014 and 2015. In the week ending Nov. 2, Netflix released eight new projects, including documentaries, comedy specials and movies, more than any breathing human could likely watch in a weekend. When the Emmy nominations were announced this summer, for the first time, Netflix had more than HBO.\n\nThe streaming service has spent billions of dollars on original programming in every genre, from Food Network-style baking competitions (\"Sugar Rush\") to foreign language sci-fi (\"Dark\") to preteen sobfests (\"Alexa and Katie\"). Sure, it's still fun and experimental. But just like traditional TV networks (whose audience size is made public, unlike Netflix), the streaming service is more frequently canceling shows that don't stick, including Marvel's \"Luke Cage\" and acclaimed true-crime parody \"American Vandal.\"\n\nParis Berelc and Isabel May on \"Alexa & Katie.\" (Photo: Adam Rose/Netlix)\n\nIn this new world of Netflix, \"Cards\" and \"Orange\" seem quaintly out of date, just five years after they broke ground.\n\nAlmost from the moment it began unveiling original programming \u2013 known until then for reruns of series like \"How I Met Your Mother\" and \"Breaking Bad\" and mail-order DVDs \u2013 Netflix changed TV. It started quietly with shows like \"Lilyhammer\" but Netflix's big coming-out moment was \"Cards,\" a drama about a ruthless politician directed by Oscar nominee David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey (then a powerhouse celebrity). It was exactly the kind of dark, serialized, twisty series that thrived in the new binge-streaming paradigm, and it became a phenomenon.\n\nNot long after, prison dramedy \"Orange\" arrived, looking, sounding and feeling like nothing else on TV, including a cast with a wide range of races, body types, socioeconomic statuses, gender identities and sexual orientations. It told women's stories at a time in television when most other programmers were trying to find the next Walter White.\n\nThis image released by Netflix shows Taylor Schilling, left, and Uzo Aduba in a scene from \"Orange Is the New Black.\" (Photo: Paul Schiraldi, AP)\n\n\"Cards\" and \"Orange\" were showered with Emmy nominations (though their wins were few) and became the face of the streaming frontier that Netflix set out to dominate. But the streaming service doesn't need them anymore.\n\nSure, both shows have declined sharply in quality, which would seemingly warrant cancellation, but the reasons for their demise go beyond just their age: Netflix now has so many other options that scratch the same itches.\n\nMore: New on Netflix in November: 'House of Cards,' 'Narcos,' and plenty of Christmas films\n\nThe service has spent hundreds of millions to woo Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy from TV networks, both creators known for making shows with diverse casts and, especially Murphy, for experimenting with form. Want politics? Netflix has also signed Barack and Michelle Obama to a production deal. It has dark dramas and anti-hero shows by the dozen, from \"Ozark\" to \"The Punisher.\" It won 23 Emmys this fall (tying perennial leader HBO), plus SAG Awards and Golden Globes aplenty. If you need to see its influence, look no further than the recently released \"Making a Murderer Part 2,\" which spends ample time outlining just how much the first chapter of the Netflix doc affected the media and the criminal justice system.\n\nWhen Netflix launched original programming, it needed big, buzzy shows to make noise. But the streaming service is now one gigantic monster, hoarding hundreds of big, medium and little shows that cater to every possible interest. Want a baking show mixed with the a sense of the macabre? Try \"The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell.\" Want a cop comedy with a cast as seemingly random as Tony Danza and Josh Groban? There's \"The Good Cop.\" Want to see pretty houses? Enjoy \"The World's Most Extraordinary Homes.\"\n\nChristine McConnell on \"The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell.\" (Photo: Netflix)\n\nNetflix's brand is everything, and its audience is everyone. \"Cards\" and \"Orange\" represent a tiny sliver of that vast canvas.\n\nViewers' main interest in the final season of \"Cards\" is how the show moves on after Spacey was fired after allegations of sexual misconduct and assault. Had the actor not fallen from grace so publicly, \"Cards\" might have premiered its final episodes even more quietly. With so much else on Netflix's welcome screen, \"Cards\" simply isn't essential viewing anymore. On its release day this year it has to compete with a lost Orson Welles movie, a Mike Judge comedy special and two documentaries. Not to mention a Julia Roberts series a few clicks away on Netflix competitor Amazon Prime.\n\nWith every passing day, Netflix executives and their checkbooks turn their attention somewhere new. Its biggest priority now seems to be conquering the film industry. And the streamer certainly seems to be making progress on that front. It's impossible to think of a new series this year that's generated the same adoration and hype that greeted its mini-rom-com film slate, from teen sensation \"The Kissing Booth\" to the by-the-numbers \"Set It Up.\" Film pundits predict that Netflix might get its first best-picture Oscar nomination for Alfonso Cuaron's \"Roma,\" due in theaters this month and on Netflix in December.\n\nSo here's to \"Cards\" and \"Orange\" and the televised revolution they helped begin. It's been a wild five years. It's both exciting and terrifying to wonder what will happen in five more.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/02/house-cards-final-season-netflix-moving-new-era/1844298002/", "", "", "2018 midterms: Racial justice motivating factor for young voters of color, poll finds\n\nMARIETTA, GA - OCTOBER 18: Voters wait in line for up to two hours to early vote at the Cobb County West Park Government Center on October 18, 2018 in Marietta, Georgia. Early voting started in Georgia on October 15th.

Kellogg Foundation's Racial Equity Anchor Collaborative, a coalition of racial justice and civil rights organizations, focused on voters ages 18-24, with an intentional oversampling of young voters of color to gain insight into Asian and Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian and Native American voters.\n\nWith less than a week for the midterms, many tight races are happening in states and districts with high numbers of voters who are people of color. Several historic races, including the Florida and Georgia governors races, could be decided by voting groups like African Americans and Latinos.\n\nMore: Oprah Winfrey says if you don't vote, you are 'dishonoring your family' at Stacey Abrams rally\n\nMore: Closed voting sites hit minority counties harder for busy midterm elections\n\nVoters ages 18 to 24 were asked to rank the issues that motivated them to vote for certain candidates. The breakdown for the top four priorities was:\n\nRacial justice (48%)\n\nEnding police mistreatment of people of color (42%)\n\nFavoring free college (39%)\n\nUniversal health care (39%)\n\nDonita Judge, senior attorney and co-program director for the Advancement Project, said the widespread agreement shows racial justice is an issue for many communities.\n\n\"People understand this moment is not just about the black community,\" she said at an event at the National Press Club Thursday.\n\nJudge said because the perspectives of certain ethnic groups aren't usually represented in polls, the Kellogg Foundation's results provide valuable insight for racial justice and civil rights organizations seeking to reach these communities.\n\nNative Americans in particular are often excluded or underrepresented in national surveys, frequently lumped in with various ethnicities in the \"other\" category. Yvette Roubideaux, director of the policy research center at the National Congress of American Indians, said the issues of racial and economic injustice are \"high on the minds\" of Native American communities and youth.\n\n\"It is a motivating factor for the elections,\" she said. \"It's motivating to talk about it as a reason to vote, as a reason to vote against policies that lead to racial and economic injustices. We feel these messages will be very helpful for us to help motivate individuals to vote.\"\n\nFor racial justice and civil rights groups looking to make a last-minute push for voter turnout on Election Day, the findings confirm what many of them knew about their communities while also providing new tools to motivate them.\n\nMore: As the midterms approach, groups nationwide try to woo college students to vote\n\nRodney McKenzie, vice president of campaigns and partnerships at the public policy nonprofit Demos, said voters of color are looking to have conversations about racial justice that are \"race explicit.\"\n\n\"When we evoke race, when we articulate an agenda to make life better for working people, it actually generates greater support than a colorblind appeal,\" he said.\n\nIn the final days leading up to the midterms, groups like Demos and NCAI are supporting voter turnout in their communities through last-minute canvassing in battleground states, educating voters about day-of registration, providing technical assistance to local organizations and more.\n\n\"We're working with our partners on the ground ... to be able to build out a multiracial movement of voting that's absolutely going to be critical,\" said Bishop Dwayne Royster, national political director of Faith in Action.\n\nAnd although organizers agree that Tuesday's elections are a key moment for communities of color, they are adamant that the work doesn't end there.\n\n\"It won't just be about voting for us. It's what are the next steps and what are the next things that are coming,\" said Judith Brown Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project. \"It's about 2020, it's about census, but it's also about what's happening in between.\"\n\nThe poll sampled 1,352 voters ages 18-24.

Buzz60's Tony Spitz has the details. Buzz60\n\nUber is upping its perks for drivers, introducing a new Pro rewards program for its top drivers.\n\nFirst being piloted in eight cities in the U.S., the rewards program will give eligible drivers up to 25 percent off \"standard car maintenance at 20,000 shops nationwide\" and up to 5 percent cash back on gas purchases made with the company's Uber Visa debit card.\n\nUber is also partnering with Arizona State University to offer free college tuition for the school's undergraduate ASU Online program. The ride-sharing company says it will completely cover tuition costs, and the perk can be transferred to cover the cost of tuition for a \"spouse, domestic partner, child, sibling, parent, legal guardian or dependent.\"\n\nTo put the perk into perspective, using ASU's online estimate tool, full-time tuition and fees for a Business Administration undergraduate degree at 12 hours per semester (assuming you are a nonresident) would cost $15,078 for the 2018-2019 academic year.\n\nUber Pro app. (Photo: Uber)\n\nUber says drivers can choose from more than 80 undergraduate degrees, noting in its announcement that since the school is online, the courses can be done on whatever schedule the driver wants.\n\nThe new program follows Uber's \"180 days of change\" initiative that the company started last year to improve its relationship with its drivers and prevent them from fleeing to other apps such as Lyft or Via. This program added tipping to the app, phone support and notifications for drivers on whether a trip would be long.\n\nKeeping drivers pleased will be key for Uber heading into 2019, when the company is rumored to be looking to go public.\n\nMore: Report: Uber, Lyft each looking to go public in 2019 as rivalry heads to Wall Street\n\nMore: Uber offers up Ride Pass monthly subscription service for discounted rates on rides\n\nMore: A burger from the sky? Uber's hoping to deliver food by drone in 2021, report\n\nAs part of the Pro program, the company will be dishing out points to drivers for completed trips that will put them into various categories: partner (all drivers), gold (300 or 600 points), platinum (600 or 1,200 points) and diamond (1,200 or 1,800 points). Each ride will receive one point, though certain ride periods will be worth three points per ride.\n\nUsers can track points, which are based on fixed three-month periods (for example, Nov. 1 through Jan. 31) in Uber's app for drivers. The number of points you get during one of those periods will determine what rewards you are eligible for the next quarter. Point accumulation resets every month.\n\nTo be eligible for the free tuition and the maximum perks Uber requires drivers to keep a rating of at least 4.85 stars with a \"low cancellation rate,\" which will help place you in the eligible platinum or diamond tiers assuming you are driving often enough to accrue the required points.\n\nDrivers in those top two tiers can also earn extra money on time and distance rates (a 3 percent bonus for platinum drivers and a 6 percent bonus for diamond).\n\nIn addition to seeing a driver's rating, Uber riders will also be able to see their driver's Uber Pro level in their app.\n\nThe ride-sharing company will begin rolling out the program in beta to drivers in Seattle, Chicago, New Orleans, Phoenix, Orlando and Tampa in Florida, Denver and New Jersey, with more people getting access to the program \"in the months ahead.\"\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/02/uber-pro-program-offers-perks-drivers-including-college-tuition/1857137002/", "FILE - In this Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018, file photo, Missouri head coach Barry Odom talks to officials during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Kentucky in Columbia, Mo.

While this doesn\u2019t sound that bold, it literally hasn\u2019t happened yet in eight games this season, which is astounding on a number of levels. But the Alabama offense faces its hardest competition by far at Tiger Stadium when it goes against an LSU defense that\u2019s already faced five ranked teams and is giving up just 15.1 points per game, seventh-best in the FBS. This game is historically pretty low scoring \u2013 the total has only gone over 50 twice since Nick Saban\u2019s arrival in 2007, including a 10-0 final the last time it was in Baton Rogue \u2013 so Tagovailoa will likely be required to go the distance. The last time we saw him play a fourth quarter he was leading Alabama\u2019s comeback in the national title game.

UCLA pulls off the upset, reminding Oregon fans of what once was.\n\nAnd maybe afterward, Kelly directs the Bruins\u2019 buses to the Dairy Queen on Coburg Road for what used to be known as a \u201cChocolate Chip Kelly\u201d (a chocolate blizzard with oreo cookies).\n\nErick Smith\n\nAmong the top seven teams in the College Football Playoff rankings, all but Clemson face potentially upsetting weekends.

It could be Georgia facing a tough challenge at Kentucky. It also might be Oklahoma which travels to Texas Tech. Night games are known to get weird in Lubbock.\n\nThe best bet is in Ann Arbor. Michigan appears to be streaking with seven consecutive wins after its season-opening stumble against Notre Dame. The Wolverines have not faced an offense as dynamic as Penn State during the streak. They're not going to be able to use their typical grind-it-out approach that has been successful against the likes of Wisconsin or Michigan State. Trace McSorely and the Nittany Lions are going to put up points. So the pressure will be on Shea Patterson to produce big plays.

Fitzpatrick will start for the Buccaneers on Sunday against the Carolina Panthers after Jameis Winston was benched. (AP Photo/Gary Landers, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nA look at some key fantasy football questions going into Week 9:\n\nWHICH UNDER THE RADAR PLAYERS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR A BIG GAME THIS WEEK?\n\nYou've got options at quarterback. Ryan Fitzpatrick starts for Tampa Bay against the Panthers, who have given up two TDs to QBs in six straight games. Fitzpatrick threw 11 TDs in his first three starts of the season and another two last week when he replaced Jameis Winston. Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco threw for 363 yards and two TDs earlier this year against the Steelers and gets them again this week. Pittsburgh has improved but has allowed the fifth most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.\n\nAt running back, Houston's Lamar Miller has improved with 233 yards rushing and two TDs the past two weeks. He faces the Broncos on Sunday, who have allowed the second second most rushing yards and third most rushing TDs to RBs.\n\nDanny Amendola has averaged eight targets and scored at least 10 points in point-per-reception leagues in each of the three games started by Miami quarterback Brock Osweiler. The Dolphins face the Jets this week, who have given up the sixth most fantasy points per game to wideouts and five touchdowns to slot receivers.\n\nJets tight end Chris Herndon has seven catches the past three weeks \u2014 but three touchdowns.\n\nWHICH PLAYERS HAVE UPSIDE BASED ON THE REST OF THE SEASON?\n\nCleveland's Nick Chubb has a great schedule ahead if new offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchen takes advantage of Chubb's skills. Four of seven games left are against teams that are top five in fantasy points allowed to running backs, making him a ripe trade target.\n\nDak Prescott got a big upgrade at WR when the Cowboys traded for Amari Cooper. He also has a QB friendly schedule for a good part of the rest of the fantasy football season. Prescott faces the Falcons (second in FPPG to QBs) in Week 11 and the Saints (third in FPPG to QBs) in Week 13. Then in the fantasy playoffs he gets the Colts and Buccaneers. Prescott is a good trade acquisition in two-quarterback leagues and potential streamer in one-QB formats.\n\nWHO HAS THE MOST LONG-TERM UPSIDE AFTER THE FLURRY OF NFL TRADES?\n\nThe Broncos trading away Demaryius Thomas opens up all kinds of opportunities for rookie WR Courtland Sutton. He already led the Broncos in end zone targets, and Sutton will see an overall uptick in targets going forward. He has a favorable matchup Sunday against a Texans pass defense that has been depleted by injuries. He won't come cheap, but his long-term potential upside makes him a player to target in trades in keeper or dynasty leagues.\n\nHOW ABOUT THOMAS?\n\nDeAndre Hopkins is unquestionably the No. 1 receiver for the Texans. But Will Fuller, whom Thomas is replacing, was averaging a little over six targets per game. Look for Thomas to be targeted similarly with an improved chance of scoring.\n\nHOW DOES GOLDEN TATE FARE AFTER BEING TRADED TO PHILADELPHIA?\n\nTight End Zach Ertz is QB Carson Wentz's favorite target. Look for Tate's per-game target average to take a slight hit. He'll still play most of his snaps from the slot, which means he'll continue to be a busy receiver. Tate already had a bye with the Lions and gets another this week because of the trade.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 9 lineup advice and tips, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Sixth-ranked Georgia is used to playing on the national stage. No. 11 Kentucky not so much.\n\nBut the Wildcats must deal with the sudden spotlight of playing the program's most important game in a generation.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference's Eastern Division title is on the line in Saturday's Top 25 nationally televised matchup between Georgia (7-1, 5-1 SEC, No. 6 CFP) and Kentucky (7-1, 5-1, No. 9 CFP). It's the schools' first meeting since 2007 with both teams ranked.\n\nIn Lexington, discussion of Kentucky's most significant football game since the 1970s has almost overshadowed buzz about the second-ranked Wildcats men's basketball team's upcoming opener Tuesday against hated rival Duke. Kentucky football coach Mark Stoops likes being part of the conversation but said earlier this week he wouldn't discuss the potential impact with players.\n\n\"I probably need to calm them down,\" the coach joked.\n\nNot that Stoops needed to remind his players of what's on the line.\n\n\"We know what's at stake,\" junior linebacker Kash Daniel said. \"We know what's riding on this game, and obviously it is a motivating factor. With big games like this it's important to go into it thinking it's just a normal game, because if you try to overdo it, mistakes happen.\"\n\nBut he added, \"this is obviously the biggest game I've ever played in.\"\n\nOff to their best start since 1977, the Wildcats are riding the momentum of an improbable 15-14 win at Missouri that has put them on the brink of their first division title. They held the Tigers without a first down in the second half and enter with the nation's top scoring defense (13.0 points per game) along with the SEC's No. 2 unit overall (295.3 yards).\n\nKentucky faces a Georgia squad that seeks to go unbeaten against the division for the second straight season. The Bulldogs are also riding an emotional wave after beating rival Florida 36-17 last week in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nThey want a return to the conference championship game to maintain their national title hopes, but doing so means beating Kentucky for the ninth straight time. Georgia coach Kirby Smart warns that could be more difficult this fall.\n\nThough his 'Dawgs appear to have the same old offensive bite with quarterback Jake Fromm (16 touchdowns) and a formidable running back tandem in D'Andre Swift and Elijah Holyfield, Smart is reminding players they're facing a completely different Wildcats team.\n\nMessage received.\n\n\"It is going to be a four-quarter game because that is the kind of team they are,\" Bulldogs junior tight end Isaac Nauta said of Kentucky. \"They are a great team that is going to keep fighting. You know, they have a chance to go to Atlanta as well. They are going to be pumped up and ready to go.\"\n\nSome other things to watch as Georgia and Kentucky settle the SEC East:\n\nBALANCE AND POINTS\n\nQuarterback Terry Wilson's season-high 267-yard passing performance and game-winning TD at Missouri finally showed the Wildcats can throw the ball. Now it's a matter of carrying it over and mixing with SEC rushing leader Benny Snell Jr. (935 yards) to achieve the needed balance against a Georgia defense ranked just behind Kentucky at (306.1 yards). Kentucky will definitely need to score more than the 14 points it has averaged the past three games.\n\nPINPOINT PASSER\n\nFromm has completed 67.4 percent of his passes for 1,649 yards and 16 touchdowns, including 240 yards and three TDs last week against the Gators. The sophomore's completion rate has put him within reach of breaking Hutson Mason's school season mark of 67.9 set four years ago.\n\nFIERCE LINEBACKERS\n\nWildcats senior linebacker Josh Allen has been all over the field this season and thrived in the pass rush with a SEC-best 10.5 and 14.5 tackles for loss. He's had help from Daniel (54 stops) and Jordan Jones (46), but the corps will face their toughest task in slowing Fromm along with Holyfield and D'Andre Swift, who have combined for more than 1,000 yards rushing and nine touchdowns. Daniel and Jones will play somewhat one-handed with each nursing injuries.\n\nALMOST AUTOMATIC\n\nGeorgia kicker Rodrigo Blankenship has converted all 36 extra-point attempts and made 13 of 15 field goals for 75 points. He's 1 of 2 from 30-39 yards and 6 of 7 from 40-49 and has made his lone chance from 50-plus yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Eli Lucero/The Herald Journal via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe reappearance in the rankings was a nice little reward for No. 18 Utah State this week. After all, it's been six years since the team last surfaced in the poll.\n\nNow, the novelty is wearing thin for coach Matt Wells, who's grown weary of the constant congratulations and pats on the back.\n\nHe's more than ready to get the focus back on football, with the Aggies (7-1, 4-0 Mountain West) trying to stay on top in the Mountain Division. They have a chance to move to 8-1 for the first time since 1963 when they travel to Hawaii (6-4, 3-2) on Saturday night.\n\n\"The bottom line is this: We don't go through the offseason in January and February and break every team huddle and say, 'Top 25 ranking on three \u2014 one, two three!'\" Wells said. \"Yeah, it's nice. It's recognition. But I want to be ranked there at the end of the year.\"\n\nUtah State faces a Rainbow Warriors team that started out torrid, but has fallen on tough times with three straight losses.\n\n\"It's always tough to win over there, because there are a ton of distractions,\" Wells said of the long trek to Honolulu. \"This is a team in Hawaii that, man, what a really good quarterback.\"\n\nThat would be in reference to Cole McDonald, who's thrown 30 TD passes this season. The sophomore with the dreadlocks has been a big reason why Hawaii has been a surprise after being picked to finish second-to-last in the West Division. If the Rainbow Warriors win Saturday, they secure a winning regular-season mark for the first time since 2010.\n\n\"We have to work really hard in order to get what we want accomplished,\" Hawaii offensive lineman J.R. Hensley said. \"Take the task at hand and get going this week.\"\n\nThe Aggies are led by quarterback Jordan Love, who earned the league's player of the week honors after throwing for a career-best 448 yards and four TDs against New Mexico.\n\n\"He could be the best quarterback in the conference. He's really smooth,\" Hawaii coach Nick Rolovich said. \"I'm really impressed with the kid.\"\n\nThings to know in a series that Utah State leads 9-6:\n\nEIGHT IS ENOUGH: The Aggies are tied with Temple for the most non-offensive touchdowns this season with eight. They have four on special teams and four more by the defense. Last week against New Mexico, safety Shaq Bond had a 100-yard interception return for a score. In addition, returner Savon Scarver has returned two kickoffs for TDs, one that went 100 yards and another for 99. \"Almost every single game we're getting one,\" Wells said. \"That usually creates momentum and our offense has fed off of it.\"\n\nSEVENTH HEAVEN: A little information on the seven-game winning streak by the Aggies: On offense, they're averaging 52 points and 489 total yards. The defense has limited teams to 20 points and forced 19 turnovers. For that, the defense credits facing Love and the explosive offense each day in practice. \"Preparing against Jordan a lot helps us on Saturdays,\" senior safety Jontrell Rocquemore said.\n\nFIRST & GOAL: The Aggies are a perfect 8-for-8 in grabbing a lead at the end of the first quarter this season. They've outscored teams by a 110-29 margin in the opening 15 minutes. For added measure, they hold a 238-72 lead in the first half.\n\nHANGING 10: Hawaii is 10-42 all-time against ranked teams, which includes a 9-25 mark at home. The Rainbow Warriors' last win over a team in the polls was Oct. 16, 2010, when they beat No. 19 Nevada at Aloha Stadium.\n\nJOHNNY BE GOOD: Junior receiver John Ursua has 14 receiving TDs for the Rainbow Warriors this season. The native of Hawaii ranks second in the nation with 1,083 yards receiving as he forms quite a combination with McDonald. Ursua was looked at by Utah State. He served a two-year mission in Paris. \"Besides the quarterback, he's what makes it go,\" Wells said. \"He's dynamic ... He's a great player.\"\n\n___\n\nMore college football coverage at http://collegefootball.ap.org and www.Twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Her fianc\u00e9, who wrote for the Post as a columnist, was critical of the Saudi regime.\n\n\"Some have approached this through the cynical prism of self-interest \u2013 statements framed by fear and cowardice; by the fear of upsetting deals or economic ties,\" Cengiz wrote. \"Some in Washington are hoping this matter will be forgotten with simple delaying tactics.\"\n\n\"But we will continue to push the Trump administration to help find justice for Jamal,\" she added. \"There will be no coverup.\"\n\nSherine Tadros, head of New York (UN) Office of Amnesty International, speaks during a news conference at the United Nations, Oct. 18, 2018.

CLARY, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCengiz\u2019s article comes exactly one month after Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate to handle routine paperwork needed for the couple to get married. Cengiz, a Turkish national, waited for her fianc\u00e9 outside the compound. He never returned.\n\n\"Jamal had just bought a house,\" Cengiz wrote Friday. \"He had a dream of building a family.\"\n\n\"At the consulate, I was left at the door alone,\" she said. \"I am the one story Jamal did not complete.\"\n\nThe whereabouts of Khashoggi\u2019s body and remains are unknown.Turkish government officials have demanded the Saudis tell authorities the location of Khashoggi's body and who ordered the murder.\n\nEarlier this week, at a memorial service for Khashoggi in London, Cengiz said she was disappointed in Trump and challenged him to \"not let money taint our conscience and compromise our values.\u201d\n\nCengiz, who last week declined Trump's invitation to the White House, directed her remarks at some of Trump\u2019s statements following the disappearance and murder of Khashoggi that appeared to downplay what happened to the Post columnist and Saudi regime critic living in self-imposed exile in the U.S.\n\nSoon after Khashoggi went missing, Trump initially accepted the denials from the Saudi royal family of any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s death and said the U.S. would be punishing itself if it canceled a $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. More recently, Trump described Saudi Arabia\u2019s handling of the Khashoggi case as the \u201cworst cover-up in the history of cover-ups.\u201d\n\nHatice Cengiz, the fiancee of the killed Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, reacts as she speaks during a memorial event for her fiancee at the Mechanical Engineers Institute in London, Monday Oct. 29, 2018.

(Photo: courtesy of Tesla Inc.)\n\nDETROIT \u2013 U.S. securities investigators have subpoenaed information from Tesla about production forecasts for the Model 3 electric car that were made last year, the company acknowledged in a regulatory filing Friday.\n\nThe disclosure in Tesla\u2019s quarterly financial report also says the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena covered other public statements made about Model 3 production.\n\nThe filing adds that Tesla is cooperating with a Justice Department request for information about Model 3 forecasts.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Tesla has formally disclosed the SEC subpoena in a regulatory filing, but there have been widespread news reports about its investigation into production forecasts.\n\nThe Model 3 is a central part of Tesla\u2019s plan to expand from a niche player in the luxury segment to a car maker with broader appeal. It\u2019s also key to the company\u2019s cash flow and pledge to make quarterly net profits into the future. In 2017 and this year, Tesla had trouble producing the cars, drawing a lawsuit from investors who said they were misled by CEO Elon Musk\u2019s production targets.\n\nMore: 5 hottest-selling U.S. vehicles in October: Tesla, Toyota, Subaru make the list\n\nEarly last year the Palo Alto, California, company announced plans to produce up to 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of 2017. But the company fell far short due to problems with automation at its Fremont, California, factory, making just 793 in the last week of 2017 and 2,700 for the entire year. It didn\u2019t hit the 5,000-a-week target until June 2018.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that the FBI is doing a criminal investigation into whether Tesla misled investors by overstating Model 3 production forecasts.\n\nTesla Inc. says in the filing that to its knowledge, no government agency in an ongoing investigation has determined that it did anything wrong.\n\nMore: Tesla electric vehicles will park themselves in 2019, Elon Musk says\n\nA company spokesman wouldn\u2019t comment beyond the filing. Messages were left Friday seeking comment from the SEC and the Justice Department.\n\nIn September, Tesla settled a civil lawsuit by the SEC over tweets by Musk that funding was in place to take the company private. Musk and Tesla agreed to pay a combined $40 million without acknowledging or denying wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cAside from the settlement with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk\u2019s statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material,\u201d the company wrote in the filing.\n\nBut the company also says if the government decides to take enforcement action \u201cthere exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial position.\u201d\n\nMore: Tesla delivers profit: 'Many argued' it was 'impossible,' CEO Elon Musk says\n\nLast month Tesla reported a $311.5 million profit for the July-through-September period, its first quarterly profit in two years. The company said it produced about 4,300 Model 3s a week, excluding planned shutdowns, and 5,300 in the final week of the quarter.\n\nA year ago, a group of shareholders sued the company in federal court alleging that it made false statements about Model 3 production and misled investors. The original complaint was dismissed but was refiled in September.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously,\u201d the company said in its filing.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/11/02/tesla-subpoenaed-us-regulators-over-model-3-production-forecasts/1857201002/", "Bring on the tears: Tom Hanks dubs upcoming 'Toy Story 4' 'profound' and a 'moment in history'\n\nBuzz Lightyear, Andy and Woody in a scene from the animated motion picture \"Toy Story 3.\" Artwork by Disney/Pixar [Via MerlinFTP Drop] (Photo: Disney/Pixar)\n\nIf you thought you cried a lot during \"Toy Story 3,\" just wait.

While the Bobcats certainly deserve some credit for this win, Western Michigan really just embarrassed itself on its home field Thursday night, finishing with what we think is the worst drive chart in college football so far this season.\n\nThe first half was particularly bad for the Broncos, starting with a missed 39-yard field goal. Hey, that happens and it was only the first drive of the game. But then it got so much worse.\n\nWestern Michigan\u2019s eight remaining first-half possessions ended like this: Fumble, blocked punt returned for a touchdown, punt, interception, fumble, fumble, turnover on downs and fumble.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly ideal, especially considering Ohio scored five touchdowns in the first 30 minutes and entered halftime with a stunning 45-0 lead over the Broncos.\n\nHowever, the second half of this disastrous game got a little better for Western Michigan, but that\u2019s not saying much when the bar was unfathomably low after the first half.\n\nThe Broncos finally got on the board early in the second half after forcing the Bobcats to go three-and-out on the opening possession. It only took 11 plays and a little more than five minutes for Western Michigan to advance 65 yards for its first score of the game \u2014 a one-yard touchdown run from Jamauri Bogan.\n\nBut that was followed by a Broncos interception on their next possession, then a punt and another touchdown \u2014 this time a 26-yard catch from Jaylen Hall \u2014 and Western Michigan\u2019s offense ended the game with two more punts.

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 No. 2 Clemson has not been challenged the past month and struggling Louisville looks to be overmatched heading into Saturday's matchup with the Tigers.\n\nClemson coach Dabo Swinney isn't buying it, and doesn't want his team to buy into thinking Saturday's game against the Cardinals will be a cake walk.\n\nSwinney, channeling his best Lou Holtz, said the Cardinals are \"the best 2-6 team\" he's seen, chock full of talented players more than capable of upsetting the Tigers (8-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference, CFP 2).\n\n\"This is not a 2-6 football team,\" Swinney said of Louisville. Their record \"is not indicative of the talent they have on this team.\"\n\nDespite Swinney's concerns, Louisville (0-5 in the ACC) likely won't be able to contain the surging Tigers .\n\nClemson has won its past three games by a staggering combined score of 163-20. The Tigers ran over then-16th-ranked North Carolina State, 41-7, turning a showdown between the league's last remaining undefeateds into a rout. They followed that with a 59-10 drubbing of Florida State, finishing with the most points the Seminoles ever allowed at Doak S. Campbell Stadium.\n\n\"They're a really good football team,\" said Louisville coach Bobby Petrino, sounding like a coach without many options.\n\nHe went on to say the Cardinals must try and stop the two things Clemson's offense does well \"and that's run the ball and throw it.\"\n\nLouisville has been one of Clemson's toughest opponents in the team's first three meetings after joining the ACC; the Tigers won those three by a touchdown or less.\n\nThe Cardinals had hoped, with Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson leading the way and the game at home last year, they would ready to finally take down the Tigers. Instead, Clemson put on a dominant show in a 47-21 win over No. 14 Louisville.\n\nAnd this latest matchup could be even more lopsided.\n\nSome other things to watch when Louisville visits No. 2 Clemson on Saturday:\n\nLAWRENCE IMPROVEMENT\n\nClemson's run through October coincided with the elevation of freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence as starter. Lawrence had passed for 797 yards, seven touchdowns and zero interceptions in the past three victories. He threw four touchdowns in dominating Florida State victory. Lawrence said he's gotten more comfortable in his position since taking over the starting job from veteran Kelly Bryant, who has since announced his intention to transfer.\n\nPLAYING THE TOP\n\nLouisville faces No. 2 Clemson after opening the year against No. 1 Alabama. It's the first time the Cardinals have played the country's top two teams. Louisville fell to the top-ranked Crimson Tide 51-14 in a game played in Orlando, Florida to start the season.\n\nHANDLING WILKINS\n\nClemson defensive tackle Christian Wilkins game some more headlines last week with his 1-yard TD run in the rout of Florida State. It was part of the Tigers' \"Fridge Package,\" named after ex-Clemson and Chicago defensive lineman William \"Refrigerator\" Perry, that had 340-pounder Dexter Lawrence at fullback leading the way with Wilkins behind. Wilkins had a touchdown reception against Troy in 2016. He said he's looking for more offense this year. \"You've got to get the heavy running back in there,\" Wilkins said. \"I'm the sixth-string running back, but I was able to get it done. I was ready for it.\"\n\nSIX PACK?\n\nLouisville has struggled this season and is hoping to stop a five-game losing streak. The Cardinals have not lost six in a row since dropping 10 straight games in in the 1997 and 1998 seasons. Louisville dropped its final eight games in 1997 to finish 1-10 under coach Ron Cooper. The team lost its first two games the next season with John L. Smith in charge and current head coach Bobby Petrino as offensive coordinator.\n\nLONG RUNNING TRADITION\n\nWhen Clemson runs down its hill into Memorial Stadium, it will mark the 400th such entrance in school history dating back to 1942.

But I usually don\u2019t really decide that until we get a little closer to the game because we always take the weather into account.\u201d\n\nAs he prepares his top-ranked football team to play its toughest opponent so far this season in the No. 4 Tigers, Saban said doesn\u2019t care about trying to convince everyone that his team isn\u2019t perfect and there\u2019s no guarantee it will steamroll everyone on its schedule.\n\nThis week \u2014 aside from the presumably short break the team took to celebrate Saban\u2019s 67th birthday Wednesday \u2014 the coach said he\u2019s been pushing self-evaluation on his players as it relates to self-awareness, effort, focus and competence before they head to Death Valley and try to remain undefeated.\n\nLSU is a two-touchdown underdog against the Crimson Tide and their exceptionally lethal offense, led by Heisman Trophy candidate Tua Tagovailoa, who has yet to throw an interception this season. Alabama debuted at No. 1 in the College Football Playoff rankings, and it has an 82 percent chance of making the playoff, along with a 33 percent chance to defend its national championship.\n\nBut Saban doesn\u2019t care about any of that, and, as he explained in an opening mini rant on the radio show, he just needs to convince his players that they\u2019re beatable, and nothing is a safe bet.\n\nSaban said:", "CLOSE Many airports hope to start using biometric scanners in lieu of passports to identify travelers.

(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 No. 22 Syracuse doesn't want to be a one-week wonder.\n\nThe Orange debut their first national ranking since 2001 on Saturday when they bring a high-powered offense to face a Wake Forest team that has had trouble containing big plays.\n\nSyracuse (6-2, 3-2 ACC, No. 19 CFP) climbed into the Top 25 for the first time since the days of Dwight Freeney on the strength of a two-game winning streak that includes a victory over North Carolina State that knocked the Wolfpack from the polls.\n\nThe Orange rank seventh nationally and second in the ACC with a scoring average of 43.6 points. Among league teams, only No. 2 Clemson (44.1 ppg) ranks higher.\n\n\"You always want to get a fast start,\" quarterback Eric Dungey said. \"We want to get a team win. It's going to take all of us.\"\n\nDungey has done it all for the Orange, leading them in both rushing and passing while ranking second in the conference in total offense at 294 total yards per game. He poses quite a challenge for what statistically is the worst defense in the ACC.\n\nWake Forest is the only team in the league allowing more than 500 total yards per game, and the last two Top 25 teams that visited Winston-Salem \u2014 No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 2 Clemson \u2014 scored 63 and 56 points, respectively.\n\nBut there have been signs of progress. The Demon Deacons (4-4, 1-3) held Louisville scoreless in the fourth quarter of their 56-35 victory over the Cardinals . That was the first zero they'd put up in a quarter since the first quarter against Rice on Sept. 29, and it counts as something to build on.\n\n\"It isn't where we need to be,\" coach Dave Clawson said, \"but it is better than a month ago.\"\n\nSome other things to know about No. 22 Syracuse's matchup with Wake Forest on Saturday:\n\nNO DODGING DUNGEY\n\nWake Forest expects Dungey's best shot. That hasn't happened since he was a freshman in 2015, when his first start came in a win over the Demon Deacons. The 2016 matchup was played in wind and rain caused by Hurricane Matthew, and Dungey missed last year's high-scoring matchup with an injury. \"We have never really gotten him healthy, at his best, since he got there,\" Clawson said. \"When he is on, he is really good.\"\n\nMORE ON DUNGEY\n\nDungey continues to move up in the ACC record book. He's responsible for 82 career touchdowns, ranking 10th in league history, and is 11 behind former N.C. State QB Russell Wilson, who's at No. 6. Dungey has 22 TDs this season \u2014 13 passing, nine rushing \u2014 and has accounted for a conference-best 134 points.\n\nNEED FOR SPEED\n\nBoth teams want to play fast. Wake Forest ranks third in the Bowl Subdivision with an average of 85.8 offensive plays per game, while the Orange are sixth at 80.6.\n\nREMEMBER NOVEMBER\n\nA trend Syracuse wants to reverse: The Orange are 0-8 in November games under coach Dino Babers and has been outscored 399-186 in those games. Dungey missed six of them with injuries.\n\nRECEIVERS GALORE\n\nSyracuse has four receivers averaging at least 11.35 yards per catch \u2014 Jamal Custis (19.2), Nykeim Johnson (15.72), Taj Harris (15.52), and Sean Riley (11.35), who tops the list with 43 receptions.\n\nTOUGH FOLLOW-UP\n\nIt'll be tough for these two teams to live up to last year's wild matchup in the Carrier Dome. Wake Forest scored 40 points in the second half to win 64-43. The teams combined for 1,355 total yards and 66 first downs \u2014 both ACC records.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

While the Bobcats certainly deserve some credit for this win, Western Michigan really just embarrassed itself on its home field Thursday night, finishing with what we think is the worst drive chart in college football so far this season.\n\nThe first half was particularly bad for the Broncos, starting with a missed 39-yard field goal. Hey, that happens and it was only the first drive of the game. But then it got so much worse.\n\nWestern Michigan\u2019s eight remaining first-half possessions ended like this: Fumble, blocked punt returned for a touchdown, punt, interception, fumble, fumble, turnover on downs and fumble.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly ideal, especially considering Ohio scored five touchdowns in the first 30 minutes and entered halftime with a stunning 45-0 lead over the Broncos.\n\nHowever, the second half of this disastrous game got a little better for Western Michigan, but that\u2019s not saying much when the bar was unfathomably low after the first half.\n\nThe Broncos finally got on the board early in the second half after forcing the Bobcats to go three-and-out on the opening possession. It only took 11 plays and a little more than five minutes for Western Michigan to advance 65 yards for its first score of the game \u2014 a one-yard touchdown run from Jamauri Bogan.\n\nBut that was followed by a Broncos interception on their next possession, then a punt and another touchdown \u2014 this time a 26-yard catch from Jaylen Hall \u2014 and Western Michigan\u2019s offense ended the game with two more punts.

Even the freshmen, a lot of them are gonna get thrown right into the fire.\u201d\n\nThose freshmen seem particularly capable of not getting burned once they do, which is a sign of how Villanova\u2019s national stature has grown with its pair of NCAA titles.\n\nIn particular, Jahvon Quinerly, the 6-1 guard from Hackensack, N.J., seems poised to make a quick impact.\n\n\u201cJavon Quinerly is a jet, an absolute jet,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a guy like that.\n\n\u201cAs a really highly touted kid, he has come in here and impressed everybody with his humility and his coachability.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll give Wright options in the backcourt with the versatile Booth and Gillespie.\n\nVillanova may have a hard time repeating the three-point ability at every position that keyed last year\u2019s 36-4 finish. But Villanova\u2019s biggest challenge may be developing the defensive determination and rebounding prowess that, typically, come with age.\n\nThis year, the Wildcats don\u2019t have a lot of that. Even last year they were late bloomers in those categories.\n\n\u201cI think what was underrated was how well we defended and rebounded by the end of the year,\u201d Wright said of last season. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna take us some time. Last year we had five guys who were experienced so we could always get five good defensive players on the court. Omari (Spellman) was the young guy, the freshmen, but really, by the end of the year, he was one of our best defensive players. Right now, this year, we have two. So that\u2019s where we really have to grow.\u2019\u2019\n\nDespite the sudden influx of youth and need for ready-and-able players, Wright doesn\u2019t plan to alter the way Villanova approaches recruiting or player development after last year\u2019s foursome \u2013 Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Donte DiVincenzo and Spellman \u2013 darted off to the NBA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find that delicate balance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still get guys who want to be in college. Because we do that, when we get hit with a year losing four guys early, we might not be as prepared to come back right away. It might take this team some time, maybe until the end of the year. But then we should have some good solid veterans again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not built like the Dukes and Kentuckys, who are used to doing it. We felt we would lose Mikal and Jalen this year even though both of them had another year. The real reason we lost them was because they graduated. Those guys liked college.\u201d\n\nDiVincenzo, who was Big East Sixth Man of the Year and Final Four MVP as a redshirt sophomore, and redshirt freshman Spellman took advantage of the opportunities afforded after stellar seasons.\n\nThe four were among the first 33 picks in the NBA draft, which will certainly make future Villanova recruits take notice.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure we don\u2019t change the way we recruit,\u201d Wright said. \u201cLosing those four guys makes it tempting to go get a one-and-done guy to replace them, when we already have guys in the program that are coming up behind them. They\u2019re just not on that level yet and we weren\u2019t counting on them yet and now they\u2019re thrown in there.\n\n\u201cSo we might take a little step back in terms of experience early in the year but, hopefully, by the end of the year we\u2019ll be a good team. We\u2019d rather do that and stay committed to our guys and stay true to our culture than try to get a quick fix.\u201d", "", "Jimmy Kimmel brings back annual Halloween candy prank, but kids are starting to catch on\n\nFor the eighth year in a row, Jimmy Kimmel recruited parents to record their kids and pretend they ate all their Halloween candy.

Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nA Google Street View car equipped with low-to-the-ground methane-sniffing sensors can detect natural gas leaks as the car drives around, reporting coordinates and methane levels every half-second. (Photo: Courtesy Environmental Defense Fund and Google Earth)\n\nIn older American cities like New York and Boston, there can be as many gas leaks as there are miles of road.\n\nHow do we know? Because Google drove those city streets \u2013 and mapped every leak.\n\nIn some communities, those funny-looking Google Street View cars driving around taking pictures of houses and storefronts are also sniffing for natural gas \u2013 part of an effort to detect and fix leaks before they become bigger problems.\n\nWhen those leaks spark fires or explosions, the cost can be measured in homes destroyed and lives lost. But even when they don't turn catastrophic, the nation's aging natural gas infrastructure has environmental and economic costs.\n\nMore: Pipeline peril: Natural gas explosions reveal silent danger lurking in old cast iron pipes\n\nMethane \u2013 the lighter-than-air flammable gas that makes up almost 100 percent of natural gas \u2013 is also a greenhouse gas, as much as 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide.\n\nOne recent study found that methane leaks from the natural gas industry are 60 percent higher than previous EPA estimates, offsetting most of the climate benefits of using cleaner-burning natural gas over coal.\n\nFinding and fixing those leaks is \"one of the best bargains out there in terms of a climate solution,\" says Jon Coifman of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nAnd customers are paying for leaked gas, even if it never reaches their homes. The Environmental Protection Agency's Inspector General estimated in 2014 that consumers were paying $194 million a year for that leaked natural gas \u2013 and that federal regulators weren't doing enough to stop it.\n\nIndeed, much of what we know about natural gas leaks comes from independent scientists such as Joe von Fischer.\n\n\"It's a fascinating problem,\" says von Fischer, a biologist at Colorado State University. \"Methane was already my favorite gas. Everybody has a favorite gas, and methane was mine.\"\n\nEight years ago, von Fischer had the idea to buy a $30,000 methane-sniffing sensor, put it in the back of his pickup truck, and drive it around Fort Collins, Colorado.\n\nHe discovered obvious sources of methane: Landfills, and a gas-powered water treatment plant. But he also discovered leaks that no one knew about.\n\nAs sensors became smaller and cheaper \u2013 they're now $3,000 and the size of a laptop computer \u2013 von Fischer joined with the Environmental Defense Fund and Google to measure leaks in major U.S. cities.\n\n\"One of the biggest capabilities that Google brings to any project we work on is the ability to scale it to a global scale,\" says Karin Tuxen-Bettman, a program manager for the Google Earth Outreach team.\n\nAnd what started with methane has now grown into a larger Google project to measure other sources of air pollution in cities around the world.\n\nMore: Tech firms like Google, Amazon push power companies toward solar and wind, a blow to coal\n\nThe Google cars suck in air and funnel it through a sensor that uses lasers to measure the amount of methane. Measurements are taken twice a second, with GPS coordinates and wind direction.\n\nThe Google cars drive every street at least twice, to rule out other sources of methane, such as natural gas-powered buses.\n\nVon Fischer says he has a good working relationship with utilities: \"I work really hard not to throw utilities under the bus. Sometimes they crawl underneath there on their own.\"\n\nSeveral, including New Jersey's PSE&G and New York's Consolidated Edison, have expressed interest in using his methods themselves.\n\nThose utilities are under increasing pressure to do something about leaks \u2013 in part because consumers and shareholders are growing more aware of the problem.\n\nAs You Sow, a shareholder activist group, has tried to force utilities to limit methane emissions with shareholder resolutions.\n\nThe resolutions rarely win in proxy fights. But As You Sow's Lila Holzman says they can often be successful in getting companies to be more transparent.\n\n\"That's a big part of what we do,\" she says. \"We really advocate for companies to do a much better job of explaining what their plans are: What are they going to do about this problem?\"\n\nExelon and DTE Energy responded to As You Sow proposals with agreements to improve transparency, Holzman said. Last month, the group filed shareholder resolutions with UGI Utilities and Atmos Energy.\n\nHalf a million leaks a year\n\nIn data submitted to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, natural gas utilities said they fixed 493,862 leaks last year. Still, they ended the year with 85,304 known leaks unaddressed.\n\nAnd under industry-written standards, that's an acceptable practice.\n\nUtilities rate leaks on a three-point scale: Grade 1 leaks are hazardous and should be repaired immediately, but smaller Grade 3 leaks can remain unfixed for years.\n\nSome of the largest utilities \u2013 the Boston Gas Co., Washington Gas and others \u2013 lose more than 3 percent of their gas to leaks, according to data they report to PHMSA.\n\nFor some smaller city-run utilities, losses are much higher. Ford City, Kansas, a town of 216 people that still sends gas customers handwritten bills, couldn't account for 40 percent of its gas last year.\n\nEvery state allows utilities to charge customers for gas lost on the way to their homes. The Supreme Court ruled in 1936 that gas leaks are \"unavoidable, no matter how carefully the business is conducted.\"\n\n\"You have to understand the business model that utilities work on,\" von Fischer says. \"These utilities really are concerned about safety. They don\u2019t want to hurt anybody. That's human nature. And of course there's legal liability. But historically they've been less concerned with the other costs of leaks.\"\n\nGoogle's methane-sniffing cars are an experiment. But the people behind them hope that the industry adopts some of their techniques to fix more leaks.\n\n\"And in the most progressive utilities,\" Von Fischer says, \"that's exactly what\u2019s happening.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/02/google-cars-sniff-natural-gas-leaks-old-utility-pipelines-explosions/1683173002/", "CLOSE If you\u2019re thinking about relocating...and traffic is a major concern, you may want to check out Waze\u2019s annual Driver Satisfaction Index.

But they remain 27 cents higher than a year ago.\n\nAbout 500 stations throughout the country were charging less than $2.25 as of Thursday.

(Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA-EFE)\n\nPoliticians often claim that whatever election is coming up is the most important in our lifetime, and the 2018 campaign has been no different.\n\nBut this time, it's not just campaign hyperbole. Races on the ballot this year \u2013 often far down the ballot \u2013 could define the national political landscape for the next decade or more.\n\nThat's because governors and state lawmakers elected in 2018 and 2020 will redo the congressional maps in 2021 \u2013 the single greatest factor in determining who will control Congress in the decade to come.\n\nThe tea party revolution of 2010 ushered Republicans into control of statehouses across the country, allowing the GOP to draw much of the current map \u2013 and to control the U.S. House for most of the last decade.\n\nThis year's election could determine whether Republicans maintain their advantage in congressional races through 2031, or if Democrats can tip the scales in their own favor.\n\n\"Democrats have been in the wilderness the past decade because they fell asleep on redistricting in 2010,\" said David Daley, a senior fellow at Fair Vote and author of a book about the last redistricting.\n\nThat means they'll have to start even earlier this time around.\n\n\"The key elections having influence on that process are almost entirely this year,\" Daley said. \"In many ways, it\u2019s going to be over after Election Day 2018.\"\n\nEnter Eric Holder.\n\nThe former Obama attorney general heads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a one-stop shop for Democratic groups to coordinate their strategy.\n\nIts mission: Win a more favorable playing field for Democrats by ensuring a complete count in the 2020 Census, removing barriers to voting, supporting ballot initiatives for redistricting reform, electing Democrats and challenging Republican-drawn districts in court.\n\nHe sees all of these as related issues: \"You see the greatest amount of voter suppression where you have the most gerrymandered states.\"\n\nThere's no comparable group on the Republican side. The National Republican Redistricting Trust is focused more narrowly on giving state Republican parties technical and legal support.\n\n\"People have characterized the NRRT as a response to Eric Holder's group, which it is not,\" said Adam Kincaid, the group's director. \"The reason is because we don\u2019t do elections. We're focused specifically on litigation and data.\"\n\nHe says other GOP committees \u2013 the Republican Governor's Association and the Republican State Leadership Committee \u2013 worry about candidates.\n\nWhere Holder sees redistricting as fundamentally broken and in need of reform, Kincaid sees no easy fix.\n\n\"The process is dirty as it is,\" he said. \"And I don\u2019t mean that in a negative way. It's just messy.\n\n\"There's not a perfect process \u2013 which is what the founders acknowledged when they designed it this way.\"\n\nThe 2018 battle for control over the next redistricting is being fought on at least four fronts:\n\nGovernors' mansions\n\nDemocrat Richard Cordray, left, and Republican Mike DeWine are running for Ohio governor. (Photo: Paul Vernon, AP)\n\nStates use different methods of drawing congressional districts. Thirty-four put the state legislature in charge. In 32 of those states, the governor has veto power.\n\nThirty-six states will elect governors this year. Most of them will serve four-year terms, so they'll still be in office three years from now, when the maps are to be redrawn.\n\nNot all states give their governors a role in the process. And some low-population states have only one congressional seat, so they don't do redistricting.\n\nBut that still leaves 20 states in which the governor elected this year will have significant influence over congressional map drawing. And they happen to include some of the most gerrymandered states in the union: Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThose five swing states go either way in presidential elections: Obama won them all in 2008, and Trump won them in 2016. But in the House of Representatives, Republicans have been able to hold a 27-seat advantage in those five states for a solid decade.\n\nIn states with one-party control of the state legislature, a governor of the opposite party can use his or her veto to force a compromise map. That can also be important for Republicans in blue states: Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts all have Democratic legislatures with incumbent Republican governors running for re-election this year.\n\nBut for Democrats trying to compete in states that have been dominated by the GOP, that's a key part of the strategy.\n\n\"We need to ensure that Democrats are at least at the table in a way that we were not in 2011,\" Holder says.\n\nBut Republicans say divided government more often leads to gridlock than compromise.\n\n\"They\u2019re not looking at a seat at the table,\" Kincaid said. \"They\u2019re looking at getting governors so they can kick these maps to the court. They want a court-drawn map.\"\n\nState courtrooms\n\nThe seven justices of the North Carolina Supreme Court. (Photo: Courtesy of the North Carolina Supreme Court)\n\nWith the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 already reluctant to weigh into partisan gerrymandering cases \u2013 could be still more hostile to redistricting challenges.\n\nBut there could be another path: state courts.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January struck down a Republican-drawn map. The court cited a provision in the state constitution that requires elections to be \"free and equal.\"\n\nAt least 25 other state constitutions require elections to be \"free and equal\" or \"free and open,\" according to Bernard Grofman and Jonathan Cervas, political scientists at the University of California, Irvine.\n\n\"So you're likely to see more litigation at the state level,\" Cervas said. \"That had never been the route until Pennsylvania.\" One exception: Florida, where voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 explicitly banning partisan gerrymandering.\n\nSo now Holder's group is looking to elect more Democratic judges. He's endorsed Anita Earls, a candidate for the North Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nThough judicial canons prevent candidates for judge from discussing specific cases, there's no doubt where the candidates there stand on gerrymandering: Earls represented the NAACP in a challenge to the North Carolina map in 2011. Her opponent, Justice Barbara Jackson, was part of the majority that upheld the maps.\n\n(The U.S. Supreme Court eventually struck down the districts in a 9-0 vote.)\n\nBallot initiatives\n\nDemonstrators rally outside the Michigan Hall of Justice in Lansing, July 18 as the Michigan Supreme Court heard arguments about whether voters should be able to pass a constitutional amendment to change how the state's voting maps are drawn. (Photo: Dale G. Young, The Detroit News via AP)\n\nFour states \u2013 Colorado, Michigan, Missouri and Utah \u2013 have redistricting initiatives on the ballot in November.\n\nThey're part of a growing grassroots movement to take redistricting out of the hands of state legislatures \u2013 or, at least, to curb their more partisan impulses by requiring a super-majority of lawmakers to agree on any new map.\n\nIn Michigan, a proposal on the ballot would put redistricting in the hands of a 13-member commission made up entirely of volunteers whose names would be drawn at random. The only requirements: They must be voters, can't be politicians, lobbyists or their relatives, and have to be balanced by party: Four Democrats, four Republicans and five independents.\n\nEric Lupher is director of the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan.\n\n\"People have really grown a healthy distrust of elected officials, and not just our current elected officials but those who will come in the future,\" he said.\n\nBut he says every state has to decide for itself what kind of redistricting process works best, based on its unique history, political culture and geography.\n\nIn May, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment that requires the approval of 60 percent of each legislative chamber, and a majority of each party, to establish a map. If they can't, the task goes to a bipartisan commission.\n\nIn Missouri, a proposal on the ballot Nov. 6 would give map-drawing powers for state legislative districts in the power of a \"non-partisan state demographer,\" subject to approval by a bipartisan commission.\n\nThe Utah proposal would have an independent commission propose boundaries to the legislature, and Colorado would give redistricting power to a commission made up of Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\nUnder any of those systems, Lupher says, expect more lawsuits.\n\n\"This is something new,\" he said. \"Somebody's ox is going to get gored, and they\u2019re going to sue. That's where we are as a culture these days: If you don\u2019t like it, litigate.\"\n\nState legislatures\n\nA protester marches outside the Supreme Court on Oct. 3, 2017 as the court heard arguments in a Wisconsin gerrymandering case.

(Photo: Jake Roth, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe 2018 NFL season might be half over, but crucial matchups loom in the season's final two months. The fun starts this weekend.\n\nWeek 9: Los Angeles Rams at New Orleans Saints \u2014 The Rams are 8-0 and the Saints have won six straight after losing the season opener. Los Angeles is in the midst of a stretch of games that will challenge its perfect record, and the Superdome has been one of the league's biggest road tests since Sean Payton and Drew Brees arrived in New Orleans.\n\nWeek 9: Green Bay Packers at New England Patriots \u2014 Tom Brady vs. Aaron Rodgers ... a showdown of all-time great quarterbacks is an easy enough sell for NBC to get a huge national television viewing audience. For the Patriots, this is a rare bump in the road to another easy AFC East crown and potentially home-field advantage in the playoffs, too. Just look at New England's schedule: Aside from hosting the Vikings in Week 13 and visiting the Steelers in Week 15, the Patriots should be enormous favorites in all of their remaining games.\n\nWeek 11: Green Bay Packers at Seattle Seahawks \u2014 These two teams currently are hanging on the precipice of playoff contention, and this game could make or break their seasons. For the Packers, this is the second of three tough road games in four weeks (aside from the aforementioned game vs. the Patriots, Green Bay plays at Minnesota in Week 12). For the Seahawks, this game is sandwiched between road games against the Rams and Panthers.\n\nMIDSEASON PREDICTIONS: Experts' picks for Super Bowl LIII, MVP and more\n\nMIDSEASON AWARDS: Rams' Gurley is MVP, while Watson has best comeback\n\nMIDSEASON WINNERS, LOSERS: 2015 QB draft class is a mess\n\nWeek 11: Minnesota Vikings at Chicago Bears \u2014 Are the upstart Bears for real? As it stands now, one game separates first from fourth in the NFC North. First-place Bears get a couple of winnable games (at Buffalo in Week 9, vs. Lions in Week 10) before hosting the Vikings. The Vikings, meanwhile, will be coming off their bye week before this pivotal divisional clash.\n\nWeek 11: Kansas City Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Rams (in Mexico City) \u2014 NFL fans in Mexico will be treated to one of the season's most anticipated matchups when the Rams \"host\" the Chiefs at the Estadio Azteca in a \"Monday Night Football\" tilt. The offenses of the Rams and Chiefs rank second and third, respectively, in the NFL in yards per game, so a shootout should be in order. Could this also be a Super Bowl LIII preview?\n\nWeek 15: Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs \u2014 The Chargers' two losses have come against teams that are a combined 15-1, and are lurking right behind the Chiefs in the AFC West. But the Bolts have dropped the last nine meetings with their divisional foe, including a 38-28 defeat earlier this year. This matchup could either decide the AFC West for the Chiefs or put pressure on Kansas City in the season's final two weeks.\n\nWeek 15: New England Patriots at Pittsburgh Steelers \u2014 For the better part of the past two decades, the Patriots and Steelers have been the AFC's most dominant teams. Their almost-annual autumn showdowns (which, conveniently for sports fans, also are almost always on national TV) almost always have a profound impact on the landscape of the AFC playoffs.\n\nWeek 17: Philadelphia Eagles at Washington Redskins \u2014 At the moment, the Redskins' closest competition in the NFC East are the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles, whose title defense hasn't gone quite as expected. There's much to be decided between now and Dec. 30, but this could game could determine the division title.\n\nWeek 17: Cincinnati Bengals at Pittsburgh Steelers \u2014 The Steelers have won three straight to reclaim first place in the AFC North, while the Bengals hit their Week 9 bye at 5-3. If Cincinnati can keep pace over the next two months, this game could have big playoff implications.\n\nWeek 17: Carolina Panthers at New Orleans Saints \u2014 The Panthers and Saints play twice in the season's final three weeks. These games should have a substantial role in shaping who claims the NFC South stretch run and potentially a valuable home playoff game (and perhaps a first-round bye, given how things have progressed so far for teams in the NFC East and NFC North).\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jim Reineking on Twitter @jimreineking.\n\n\n\n", "New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis (56) stands on the field before the game against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium. (Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nGo ahead, Demario Davis, enlighten us.\n\n\u201cLouisiana is one of only two states where you can be convicted of a felony without a unanimous jury verdict,\u201d the New Orleans Saints linebacker told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s bad is that Louisiana is (by some measures) leading the nation in wrongful convictions.\n\n\"This shows the system is not working.\u201d\n\nThe system. That\u2019s why Davis is campaigning for voters to pass Louisiana Amendment 2 on Tuesday, which would scrap the \u201c10-2\u201d system \u2013 it takes only 10 of 12 jurors to vote guilty for a felony conviction to be secured \u2013 and represent a huge step toward reducing the chances that innocent people are wrongfully convicted.\n\n\u201cIn a nation where you\u2019re innocent until proven guilty,\u201d Davis added, \u201cwe need to make sure that people are allowed their due process.\u201d\n\nSure, the Saints have a showdown against the undefeated Rams on Sunday at the Superdome, where Davis will have his hands full in trying to keep up with Todd Gurley and Co.\n\nBut two days after the big game comes another big Election Day.\n\nDavis, 29, embodies the increasing activism by many NFL players amid this tense political climate. After a protest launched in 2016 by quarterback Colin Kaepernick ignited national debate, players such as Davis, a member of the Players Coalition, have been inspired to fight social injustices by other means \u2013 and in some ways with the support of the NFL, which has partnered with players for a $90 million joint social justice initiative.\n\nMore: NFL's officiating problems have quieted down, but some issues remain\n\nMore: USA TODAY Sports' Week 9 NFL picks: Aaron Rodgers-Tom Brady showdown, Rams-Saints game highlight big weekend\n\nEarlier this year, Davis and Saints tight end Benjamin Watson threw their weight behind House Bill 265, which was passed to restore voting rights for ex-felons on probation or parole in Louisiana, beginning in March 2019.\n\nNow Davis, the son of an Army veteran, is moved to bring attention to another issue that he believes needs the voices of people with platforms to shed light. Sobering statistics, which show a pattern of racial inequality, underscore exactly why he is such an advocate for this specific cause.\n\nAccording to the National Registry of Exonerations, Orleans Parish, where New Orleans is situated, ranked highest from 1989 to 2015 among counties of at least 300,000 residents for its per-capita exoneration rate (9.33). Adjacent Jefferson Parish is fourth (5.03) on the list.\n\nWhile Louisiana (with a booming prison construction industry and an incarceration rate more than 50% higher than the national average) ranks ninth in the total number of exonerations dating to 1989 (59), no state has a higher average of years lost per case (14.3 years) for those exonerated, according to the registry. Furthermore, nearly half of the 1,900 exonerations cited by the registry nationwide were African-Americans. The registry, a joint project by the University of Michigan Law School, the Newkirk Center for Science & Society at Cal-Irvine and the Michigan State University College of Law, also concluded in 2017 that African-Americans were 12 times more likely than whites to be wrongly convicted for drug offenses.\n\nAlso: Experts insist that many wrongful convictions are never overturned. According to a 2016 CourtWatch NOLA report, 57% of trials reviewed contained no physical evidence. And too often, the convictions come without corroborating eyewitnesses.\n\nStatistics, loopholes and the real people that Davis has encountered while exploring the issue \u2013 he said he spoke with one man who was wrongfully imprisoned for 13 years, another for 20 years \u2013 have simply put, made him care enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to be advocates in a lot of different spaces in trying to reduce mass incarceration, which primarily affects black and brown people,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe want to create real solutions.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s hopeful that Amendment 2 will become another measure to change the world, optimistic because he senses there is legitimate bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cJudges, prosecutors, everybody is like, \u2018This law needs to change,\u2019 \u201c Davis said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of momentum.\u201d\n\nThe definitive measures will come next Tuesday.\n\n\"There\u2019s a myth out there with some people: \u2018My vote doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 \u201c Davis said. \u201cWell, your vote does matter. Who\u2019s the D.A.? Who\u2019s the Sheriff? There are issues right in your backyard, where if you don\u2019t vote, you\u2019re silencing your own voice.\u201d\n\nDavis, who grew up in Mississippi, talked about such issues for nearly half-hour during a phone interview. When I visited with him at his locker on Sunday night in Minnesota, it was all football as he was brimming with pride that the Saints defense came up with clutch big plays to win at one of the toughest venues in the league.\n\nYet in this conversation, football never came up. That was refreshing, yet not surprising for a man who established a foundation this year with his wife, Tamela, dedicated to closing the gap in educational disparities. As important as football is for a player on his third NFL team in seven seasons, he sees a world bigger than the NFL \u2013 a world the NFL can do much with its platform to change for the better.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the NFL can be a leader, so that other corporations can do the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we can all be united about. Make sure the promises of this country extend to all four corners of the flag.\u201d\n\nThe man sure can express a message. Even better if it has the intended impact.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.", "bad url", "bad url", "bad url", "Teresa Giudice talks 'Housewives,' husband's deportation: 'Families shouldn't be broken up'\n\nCLOSE After serving 11 months in prison for fraud charges, Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice was released from federal prison early Wednesday. iudice was picked up from the Danbury Federal facility in Connecticut by her lawyer. USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Teresa Giudice doesn't really want to think about it.

He has until Nov. 9 to appeal the judge's ruling.\n\nThe \"Real Housewives\" star, best-selling author and mom is a straight shooter when she reveals how she feels about her husband's legal situation.\n\n\"It\u2019s sad, families shouldn\u2019t be broken up this way,\" Giudice says. \"Especially when it\u2019s a nonviolent, it\u2019s a white collar crime. He\u2019s paying for his mistakes.\"\n\nJoe is currently serving a 41-month federal prison sentence for bankruptcy fraud, entering prison after his wife served nearly a year after pleading guilty to bankruptcy fraud herself. Fans of Giudice kept up with her during the stint with the Bravo three-part TV special \"Teresa Checks In,\" which chronicled the aftermath of her sentencing.\n\nWhen it comes to thinking about all the possibilities (Will Joe be deported? Will the family move to Italy?), however, Giudice doesn't want to answer questions about what's next.\n\n\"I'm just taking it day by day,\" she says, confirming that she doesn't want to think that far ahead yet.\n\nTeresa Giudice opened up about her husband's time in prison, how she and her children are coping and the upcoming season of \"Real Housewives of New Jersey.\" (Photo: Tommy Garcia/Bravo Media)\n\nOutside of any histrionics of past reunion specials or real life drama, Giudice is still a wife and a mother to the couple's four daughters \u2013 Gia, 17, Gabriella, 14, Milania, 12, and Audriana, 9.\n\nIn fact, she says her favorite part of her relationship with Joe is their kids, calling them her \"pride and joy\" and even saying that giving birth to Audriana on the show was one of her favorite memories as a \"Real Housewife.\"\n\nShe's temporarily a single parent right now. \"I\u2019m doing this all by myself,\" she says of the biggest challenge of her situation. \"I didn\u2019t sign up to have four kids on my own.

They adore their father.\"\n\n\"Everything that I\u2019ve been through, adults can handle it, but children, it\u2019s hard for them,\" Giudice says. \"Just looking at them the way they\u2019re handling it, it amazes me. It shows me that I am doing a good job, because they\u2019re great.\"\n\nAbove all the legal drama, Giudice says she's just trying to stay positive.\n\nFor one, she's got the new season of \"Real Housewives,\" premiering on Nov. 7.

(Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nApproximately halfway through the regular season, some clarity has emerged throughout the NFL.\n\nThe league seemingly has reached a healthier point with points and television ratings on the rise. The contenders are starting to emerge while some early upstart teams have started to cool.\n\nHere's a look at what we\u2019ve learned so far this season, as well as some of the biggest surprises and disappointments.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned\n\nDon't sweat the slow starts: Some of the NFL\u2019s premier teams sparked concern by stumbling early. The Saints' defense got embarrassed in a 48-40 Week 1 loss to Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Buccaneers. The Patriots appeared wobbly at 1-2 after losses to the Jaguars and Lions. The Steelers went 1-2-1.\n\nBut each of these squads has rounded back into the forms we all expected. The Saints have won six straight, while the Patriots claimed their last five and the Steelers their last three.\n\nThe Saints are coming off two victories over formidable foes (the Ravens and Vikings), with their defense posting one of the unit's most impressive showings against an explosive Minnesota attack.\n\nMeanwhile, a Patriots offense that lacked firepower early has benefited from Julian Edelman's return from suspension and the trade for Josh Gordon.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Ben Roethlisberger looked dreadful as he committed five turnovers in the season-opening tie with Cleveland. But he and Antonio Brown have rediscovered their connection, and James Conner has emerged at running back amid all-pro Le'Veon Bell's continued absence.\n\nThe Texans also slipped up early with an 0-3 start but now lead the AFC South thanks to quarterback Deshaun Watson powering a five-game winning streak.\n\nMore: NFL midseason winners, losers: Jameis Winston among young QBs who can't find footing\n\nMore: NFL midseason awards: Rams' Todd Gurley is MVP, while Deshaun Watson has best comeback\n\nMore: USA TODAY Sports' 2018 NFL midseason predictions for Super Bowl LIII, MVP and more\n\nDefense still matters to some: Rule changes and new points of emphasis forced a dramatic shift for defensive players, as offenses have scored at a record pace and quarterbacks have been prolific. But the Redskins have become one of the league's outliers and biggest surprises by leaning on their defense. Washington's offense ranks just 27th overall and 25th in scoring (20.9 points per game), but the 5-2 leaders of the NFC East boast a punishing defense that ranks second overall and fifth in points allowed (19.1). A fierce front seven led by first-round Alabama linemen Jonathan Allen (2017) and Daron Payne (2018) hasn't allowed an opposing running back to gain more than 61 yards in any game this season. The pressure up front has also played a role in safety D.J. Swearinger snagging a league-high four interceptions.\n\nThe Rams are for real: It wasn\u2019t just beginner's luck in 2017 for then-rookie coach Sean McVay. Standing as the lone unbeaten at 8-0, his team is even better this year. The Rams have often won in blowout fashion, but they survived their toughest test yet last week by topping the Packers 29-27. Their success has come while integrating new pieces and while dealing with key injuries. Jared Goff has taken a significant step in his command of the offense and ranks third in passing yards (2,425) while throwing for 17 touchdowns and just five interceptions.\n\nBiggest surprises\n\nPatrick Mahomes: Andy Reid moved on from Alex Smith despite the veteran quarterback's five consecutive winning seasons and four playoff appearances. But the Chiefs coach's 2017 first-round pick was ready to shine. Mahomes leads the league both in passing yards (2,526) and touchdowns (26) for 7-1 Kansas City.\n\nAdam Thielen: Undrafted out of Minnesota State-Mankato, Thielen has made a steady climb and exploded this season with a record-tying eight consecutive 100-yard games.\n\nJames Conner: The Steelers\u2019 offense looked poised to take a significant step back without Bell. But Conner, a third-round pick in 2017, has stepped in nicely, averaging 4.7 yards per carry while amassing 599 rushing yards and nine touchdowns (both second-most in the league).\n\nBiggest disappointments\n\nGiants: New York expected to get back on track right away by plugging in new coach Pat Shurmur and No. 2 pick Saquon Barkley. Instead, the Giants are 1-7. Eli Manning has struggled mightily behind an awful offensive line and faces questions if he should remain the starter. Odell Beckham Jr. has expressed discontentment with the franchise that just gave him a record $90 million contract and has called out everyone from Manning to his coaches.\n\nJon Gruden\u2019s Raiders: He left the broadcast booth for a 10-year, $100-million contract and had many expecting a quick turnaround. But Gruden has instead angered the fan base and frustrated some of his own players by trading Khalil Mack to the Bears just before the season and sending wide receiver Amari Cooper to the Cowboys last week. Those moves freed up cap space and brought in a total of three first-round draft picks, but that return is little solace for a team that has floundered this season.\n\nBrowns: Cleveland entered the season with a lot of buzz, but not even general manager John Dorsey and No. 1 pick Baker Mayfield could save the franchise from dysfunction. Three straight losses and division among the coaching ranks led to this week\u2019s firing of head coach Hue Jackson (3-36-1 at the helm) and offensive coordinator Todd Haley. The 2-5-1 Browns (now led by interim Gregg Williams) have a rough road ahead down the stretch of the season.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "CLOSE Been living under a rock?

USA TODAY\n\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) shouts at the line of scrimmage during the first quarter against the Houston Texans at NRG Stadium. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMost NFL teams have reached halftime of their 2018 season. It's a natural point to re-evaluate priorities and make adjustments. With that in mind, here's one major question each club faces moving forward:\n\nAFC\n\nBaltimore Ravens: Is the future near? After a promising 3-1 start, they sit at 4-4 with the division-leading Steelers coming to town. We know GM Ozzie Newsome is winding down, so it seems unlikely that rookie QB Lamar Jackson would replace Joe Flacco until this club's postseason possibilities are officially exhausted. Right?\n\nBuffalo Bills: How do they help Josh Allen? An unpolished prospect carrying a franchise's hopes on his howitzer arm deserves better. Before sustaining a Week 6 elbow injury, Allen was regularly running for his life while relying on a 30-year-old running back (LeSean McCoy) as his primary weapon. Allen's development could be in serious jeopardy without a major course correction.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: What if they don't take care of business? Same old Stripes? A talented bunch sitting at 5-3, good for the AFC's second wild card at present, which will finish with at least 10 wins by beating the remaining teams on its schedule with records at .500 or worse. But Cincy has a tendency to come up small. Will there be notable repercussions this time if the roster's nucleus again proves radioactive to success?\n\nCleveland Browns: Who's the next coach?With Hue Jackson out, they can begin searching in earnest for his successor. GM John Dorsey surely has to find an offensive specialist who can bond with Baker Mayfield, while hoping the quarterback's rookie season doesn't devolve into a wasted experience.\n\nMore: In firing Hue Jackson, Browns once again left to pay for lack of plan\n\nMore: NFL hot seat rankings: Which coach is next to go after Hue Jackson?\n\nDenver Broncos: Do they have the right leadership? It's a sensitive question given the pandemonium at the executive/ownership level amid Pat Bowlen's failing health and his family's legal maneuverings. But on the football level, GM John Elway's inability to acquire an effective quarterback not named Peyton continues, and second-year coach Vance Joseph is on the verge of leading this team to successive losing seasons for the first time since 1972.\n\nHouston Texans: Can they absorb Will Fuller's absence? QB Deshaun Watson and WR DeAndre Hopkins are the offense's rightful stars. But Fuller, who tore an ACL in Week 8, is a vital component as his deep speed maximizes Watson's arm and, more importantly, opens the field for Hopkins and the running game. Demaryius Thomas' arrival hardly offsets Fuller's loss.\n\nIndianapolis Colts: Should they consider shutting Andrew Luck down? Maybe it sounds like a silly thought for a team rebuilding around its resurgent star, who clearly needs reps with so many relatively unfamiliar teammates. Yet considering Luck's rebuilt shoulder has logged a league-high 342 passes so far, is it worth resting him at some point \u2014 assuming Indy's playoff viability evaporates \u2014 to potentially showcase backup Jacoby Brissett as offseason trade bait? Just sayin'.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: Time to face the Blake Bortles facts? In fairness to the quarterback, the offense's shortcomings go beyond his issues. But there's no sugarcoating the fact the Jags have to answer some hard questions, namely whether Bortles really is the answer. Even if the front office still believes the answer is yes, does the locker room?\n\nKansas City Chiefs: Is this Andy Reid's year? He's one of the better coaches in league history, full stop \u2014 and better still when a team winning by nearly 13 points per week doesn't stir criticism of Reid's clock management. These Chiefs could be something special now that Reid has masterfully woven Patrick Mahomes' talents into this playbook. Are they special enough to finally capture the Lombardi Trophy that's eluded their coach for so long?\n\nMore: NFL midseason awards: Rams' Todd Gurley is MVP, while Deshaun Watson has best comeback\n\nMore: USA TODAY Sports' 2018 NFL midseason predictions for Super Bowl LIII, MVP and more\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: When will Joey Bosa play? This dude is really good \u2014 23 sacks in 28 NFL games, or 0.82 per. (J.J. Watt's career per game average is 0.88.) But the mysterious foot injury that's dogged Bosa for three months continues to sideline him. His presence could be the difference between legitimate and laughable Super Bowl aspirations.\n\nMiami Dolphins: Whither Ryan Tannehill? The supposed franchise quarterback is hurt, again, and the Fins are left to tread water. Tannehill has two years left on his contract with significant cap hits attached to both. But this organization can't continue operating in limbo and should probably start considering potential alternatives such as Teddy Bridgewater or even Jameis Winston \u2014 if not the 2019 draft \u2014 to clear some secondary path that allows the team to effectively move forward without Tannehill.\n\nNew England Patriots: Can they buck history? Did you know the Pats have never reached a Super Bowl the season after losing it? They're on track for another AFC East title \u2014 yawn \u2014 but the conference competition looks a lot stronger than last year, and there has to be some worry about the ability of Rob Gronkowski, Sony Michel and others to make it to the finish line.\n\nNew York Jets: What's our identity? GM Mike Maccagnan has done a nice job mining the secondary free agent market in recent years for players like CB Morris Claiborne and G James Carpenter. But with more than $200 million in cap space available over the next two years, Maccagnan and his staff must take a hard look at their foundation to determine how to allocate resources to a rebuild that needs to accelerate around Sam Darnold.\n\nOakland Raiders: Where will they play in 2019? Amid all the uproar over Khalil Mack, Amari Cooper and Derek Carr's phantom tears, not much handwringing \u2014 yet \u2014 given this team has no stadium lease for next year. So ... Oakland? Vegas? Santa Clara? San Diego? Peoria? High risk for a shiner that might necessitate a second eyepatch for Mr. Raider.\n\nMore: Jon Gruden says players call him 'dying' to join Oakland Raiders\n\nPittsburgh Steelers: How to love Le'Veon? All-pro RB Le'Veon Bell will surely be reporting for duty by Nov. 13 if he wants to accrue the prized season toward free agent status he desperately covets. But how do the Steelers blend him back into the family, not to mention the offense, without upsetting the apple cart for a group currently atop the AFC North? These players, many miffed when Bell didn't show up for Week 1, have done just fine with James Conner assuming the bellcow mantle.\n\nTennessee Titans: Is Marcus Mariota the guy? The fourth-year quarterback's intangibles and, apparently, internal support remain off the charts \u2014 particularly as he fights through an elbow injury. But is he regressing further between the lines while trying to lead an offense that ranks as the league's third worst? The franchise can defer the decision on Mariota's next contract ... but not for long.\n\nNFC\n\nArizona Cardinals: Is this the proper environment for Josh Rosen? The Cards unexpectedly managed to draft the quarterback they think will take them to the promised land. Yet Rosen is trying to learn the ropes under a rookie head coach and, now, a rookie offensive coordinator \u2014 to say nothing of personnel issues, namely the O-line.\n\nAtlanta Falcons: Do they have time to rebound? They'd obviously like to be the first team to play a Super Bowl on its home field (I'd like it, too). Atlanta has never reached the playoffs after a 1-4 start and must play six of its final nine games on the road. But the Falcons have won their last two, Matt Ryan's play is near his 2016 MVP level, and LB Deion Jones and RB Devonta Freeman could return from IR if their teammates provide a reasonable opportunity.\n\nCarolina Panthers: Can they win on the road? The Cats are 5-2, but 1-2 away from Charlotte. Five of their final nine games are roadies. Bigger picture, in the Cam Newton era, this club is 3-1 at home during the playoffs and 0-3 away from it. And, unless, they can overtake the scorching Saints in the NFC South, the Panthers won't be home if they're still alive in January.\n\nChicago Bears: Can they stay healthy enough to contend? It's a concern that applies to any team. But a young one like this, trying to remain afloat in a brutal division, can ill afford to be without veterans like Khalil Mack, Allen Robinson or Kyle Long \u2014 he's definitely out for a protracted period with an injured foot.\n\nMore: NFL midseason winners, losers: Jameis Winston among young QBs who can't find footing\n\nMore: USA TODAY Sports' Week 9 NFL picks: Aaron Rodgers-Tom Brady showdown, Rams-Saints game highlight big weekend\n\nDallas Cowboys: Have we seen the best of Dak Prescott? Yes, another quarterback question. But this is especially compelling given Prescott, slated to make $720,000 in base salary next year, will be eligible for his first extension. Jerry Jones has given him a new No. 1 receiver in Amari Cooper (good call, Jerry?) and new O-line coach (good call, Jerry). Now it's up to Prescott to prove his career didn't plateau immediately, a la Bortles, Jay Cutler, Robert Griffin III and Colin Kaepernick.\n\nDetroit Lions: How will they handle Golden Tate's departure? Easy to defend the trade of the veteran wideout and equally easy to rip the move. What's less clear is how the offense will adapt minus its No. 1 receiver or how a team in the throes of a cultural sea change will react to a forward-looking decision that undermines the ability to win now.\n\nMore: NFL trade deadline winners, losers: Packers, Patriots prove perplexing in different ways\n\nGreen Bay Packers: Will Aaron Rodgers' frustration boil over? The NFL's highest-paid player is also, arguably, its best. But is Rodgers the saltiest of all, too? He wasn't happy about WR Jordy Nelson's release, wasn't pleased with the play calling early in the season and was most certainly peeved about now-departed Ty Montgomery's comeback-crushing return Sunday in L.A. If a team capable of far more continues to hover at .500, you have to wonder if Mount Rodgers will blow.\n\nLos Angeles Rams: What's their weakness? They're 8-0. They have great \u2014 great \u2014 players on both sides of the ball and a fantastic \u2014 fantastic \u2014 coaching staff. Looking for a fatal flaw is like poring over the Death Star blueprints. There may be a thermal exhaust port somewhere, but it ain't gonna be easy to find ... or hit.\n\nNew Orleans Saints: Can they capture the NFC's top seed? It's only happened once in the Sean Payton-Drew Brees era, and that was 2009 \u2014 coincidentally or not, the only time this franchise won the Super Bowl. Though the 2018 Saints seem built for all climates, sure would be nice to have N'awlins home cooking in the Superdome given the other five playoffs trips since 2006 have all encountered voodoo on the road. Sunday's contest with the Rams looms very large.\n\nNew York Giants: Should they pull the plug on Eli? At least Pat Shurmur knows how not to handle this situation (thanks, McAdoo). But given rookie Kyle Lauletta's surprise \"traffic deal,\" not to mention his big-game inexperience, the real question might not be whether to bench Eli Manning, but deciding whether to let him go entirely in 2019.\n\nMinnesota Vikings: Will they put it all together? One week, Kirk Cousins and the passing game have a $28 million luster, the next he and Stefon Diggs are teaming up on a fatal pick-six. One week, the Vikes get plowed by Buffalo, then they're going toe-to-toe with the Rams. What will Dalvin Cook contribute? How about Everson Griffen? Oops, that turned into several questions.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: Can they overtake Washington? This is setting up as the eighth time in nine years that the NFC East will send just one team to the playoffs. If it's going to be the reigning champs, currently 4-4, they'll need to get healthy, stop turning the ball over and \u2014 perhaps most important \u2014 may have to sweep both upcoming games against the first-place Redskins (5-2).\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: Can Kyle Shanahan keep them competitive? Their season ended in Week 3 when Jimmy Garoppolo's left knee buckled. But the Niners have been almost unfailingly competitive since, a forgivable blowout to the Rams in Week 7 notwithstanding, and broke through for their second win Thursday night by thrashing Oakland. With more beatable opponents ahead, Shanahan and Co. can continue cultivating winning DNA for 2019.\n\nSeattle Seahawks: Have they successfully rebooted, or is this a smokescreen? They're running the ball at Beast Mode levels. Russell Wilson is playing some of the most efficient ball of his seven-year career. An almost entirely overhauled defense ranks in the top five. Are the 'Hawks back? Or are they living right given they haven't beaten a team with a winning record and should have three more freebies against Arizona and San Francisco?\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: What happens to Jameis Winston? The No. 1 pick of the 2015 draft, who began this season on the suspended list, now sits on the bench for his football failures. The Bucs face a franchise-defining decision in the offseason, when they'll likely have to decide whether to keep Winston in 2019 or let him go and face the subsequent hurdles that will arise.\n\nWashington Redskins: Can Adrian Peterson keep it up? A living legend is having a renaissance season as the league's fifth-leading rusher despite joining his new team in late August. But as much as he tries to defy age, \"AD\" is still 33 and has broken down each of the past two seasons. This limited offense simply can't afford to lose him.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "CLOSE Former \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 reality series star Mike Sorrentino, more commonly known as 'The Situation' is facing several federal tax charges.

USA TODAY\n\nAlabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa lines up take a snap against Arkansas. (Photo: Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. \u2013 As he left the room, laughing, he called over his shoulder: \u201cI\u2019m going to take your job!\u201d Tua Tagovailoa was only kidding, we think (and hope) \u2013 but after his brief stint conducting an interview instead of sitting for one, it was hard to say for sure.\n\nAfter finishing an interview last week, the Alabama quarterback began posing questions of his own to an in-house video crew. Within minutes he was behind the camera, shooting video of teammate Jonah Williams, Alabama\u2019s standout left tackle. And then he was asking Williams questions.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d said Williams, who seemed slightly bemused by the entire experience. \u201cBut I think sometimes it\u2019s probably a little word vomit. He\u2019s just throwing together buzz words, but his questions were honestly good, so you know \u2013 maybe after football?\u201d\n\nFile that away, because Tagovailoa has famously already taken one job. And since then, he has taken Alabama\u2019s offense to a whole \u2018nother level.\n\nIt is by far the best, most explosive attack ever produced by \u2018Bama during college football\u2019s current dynasty. Which is why even with a huge test looming Saturday night \u2013 LSU awaits in Baton Rouge \u2013 an oft-repeated, very serious question before a matchup of No. 1 vs. No. 3 in the College Football Playoff\u2019s initial Top 25 has been:\n\nWill Tua finally play in a fourth quarter?\n\nGAMES OF IMPACT: Analyzing the biggest games during Week 10\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: Upsets among the top seven and an unhappy reunion\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Alabama-LSU highlights jam-packed schedule in Week 10\n\nJust in being asked, it diminishes the magnitude of the showdown, sure. But Alabama is heavily favored, and the Crimson Tide\u2019s offense is the heavy reason why. Which is why this next question is not unexpected, even if it is clearly unwanted: Is this Alabama\u2019s best team?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do,\u201d sophomore nose guard Quinnen Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got to finish.\u201d\n\nThis is the correct answer, and probably the only one allowed to be spoken aloud within the Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility. But eight games into the season, Nick Saban reminds everyone:\n\n\u201cI said at the beginning of the year, we\u2019re gonna have a different kind of team.\u201d\n\nBut does different mean better (or best)? Led by its sophomore quarterback, Alabama\u2019s offense has morphed into something monstrous, unlike anything previously seen out of Tuscaloosa.\n\nSuddenly and radically, the formula has changed. No more grinding away at opponents while relying on a defense to asphyxiate them. Now it\u2019s an offensive avalanche, right from the opening kickoff, with opponents buried before halftime.\n\nWe are used to seeing Alabama ranked No. 1 in the polls, but not in offensive categories. But the Tide ranks No. 1 nationally in scoring, averaging 54.1 points \u2013 a full 15 points higher than any previous team during Saban\u2019s tenure. Alabama ranks No. 2 in total offense, averaging 564.3 yards; and No. 2 in yards per play, averaging an astounding 8.3.\n\nAnd all of this despite shutting things down in second halves. Tagovailoa\u2019s rise began when he came on in the second half of the national championship game, then threw that 41-yard touchdown pass on second-and-26 in overtime. But he has not taken a snap in the fourth quarter this season.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no need for me to be in there in the fourth quarter, then there\u2019s no need,\u201d Tagovailoa said, adding: \u201c\u201cI do believe it would be good for our team to have to go through a full, 60-minute game.\u201d\n\nTagovailoa has completed 70 percent of his passes, including 25 touchdowns without an interception. In 61 possessions he has led, Alabama has scored 46 times (41 touchdowns, five field goals). Saban says Tagovailoa has \u201cit,\u201d that intangible quality that defines the best quarterbacks.\n\nBut the coach is completely unwilling, at this point, to say Alabama has \u201cit,\u201d the quality that has defined so many of his teams during this run of five national championships in the last 10 seasons.\n\nAlabama wide receiver Jerry Jeudy (4) celebrates with wide receiver DeVonta Smith after scoring a touchdown against Arkansas. (Photo: Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSaban, ever cautious, always concerned \u2013 by nature of his profession, he\u2019s a pessimist \u2013 knows we see this football team like a sleek sportscar, pretty girl driving with the top down, cruising through perfect autumn Saturdays without a care in the world.\n\n\u201cNobody sees the oil leaking,\u201d he said. \u201cOr the bald tires.\u201d\n\nHe could be referring to defensive deficiencies; at least by Alabama\u2019s lofty standards, this defense has been decent, not dominant. Or he could be looking back at the Tide\u2019s path so far, which has been a wide-open highway free of traffic, completely devoid of anything remotely resembling an obstacle.\n\nOpponents\u2019 defenses have not presented so much as a speed bump. Using yards per play, which in this era of varied offensive tempo is probably a better gauge than total defense, the best defense Alabama has faced was Missouri \u2013 which ranked 90th.\n\nThe road might be about to get rougher. LSU ranks 24th in yards per play, and is especially good against the pass, ranking first nationally with 12 interceptions. And unlike most of Alabama's opponents, the Tigers also annually feature athletes with the measurables to match up.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Alabama\u2019s defensive lapses might simply have been what happens late in games, during mop-up time after opponents have been pulverized: 95 of opponents\u2019 127 points came while Alabama led by at least three touchdowns. But instead of allowing that excuse, Saban sounds an alarm, saying he recently warned his players of potential danger.\n\n\u201cI think we let our guard down some,\u201d he said, \u201cand we don\u2019t play to the same level throughout a game. And we get slapped around a little bit when we do that. If we do that against better competition, we\u2019re gonna get knocked out.\u201d\n\nLSU isn\u2019t only a huge test. It\u2019s the Crimson Tide\u2019s first real test, the first time we see if the video game dominance of the first two-thirds of the season continues when the difficulty mode is ratcheted beyond \u2018easy.\u2019 But there\u2019s reason to suspect it might.\n\nThis Alabama offense is perhaps the logical evolution of Saban\u2019s adaptation to the changing environment. Gone are the long-ago days of 2011, when the Tide and Tigers hooked up for a 9-6 slugfest, and when against lesser opponents, Alabama\u2019s preferred mode was ball-control running spiced with occasional play-action passing. Suddenly, \u2018Bama is all uptempo, passing to set up the run \u2013 looking a lot like so many other offenses in college football, only with better players. Which leads to this: Is it Tagovailoa? Or the scheme?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of both,\u201d Saban said. \u201cThrough the years, being on the defensive side of the ball, you see how difficult some of these things are to defend. So gradually we\u2019ve implemented some of these things.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that we also have exactly the right kind of team to do it. The quarterback is very comfortable and instinctive in doing it. The receivers that we have do a really good job of it. We\u2019ve got good enough running backs that people have to respect the run and try to stop the run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a combination of all those things that sort of got us to this point.\u201d\n\nIn all of that, Saban didn\u2019t mention an offensive line that might be one of the best he\u2019s had at Alabama. But the entire combination \u2013 scheme, quarterback, complementary parts \u2013 has led to unprecedented production and at least for now, a sense of invulnerability.\n\nThat last part might not be reality \u2013 we might get a better feel this weekend \u2013 which is perhaps why it\u2019s still not clear if Saban is comfortable with Alabama\u2019s metamorphosis to an offensive-first approach.\n\n\u201cI know people love to play this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand. It\u2019s entertaining. But so many factors contribute to how. Injuries \u2013 injuries to the wrong players. There\u2019s so many factors, and if people could maintain intensity \u2026 I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re doing, everyone struggles to do that.\u201d\n\nHe paused, then added a final thought that might be apropos considering Saturday\u2019s matchup:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still the old fundamental,\u201d he said. \u201cGood pitching beats good hitting. You\u2019ve got to be able to keep from getting beat sometimes before you win.\u201d", "SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) \u2014 The leaders of four Balkan countries say they will make a joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe prime ministers of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and the president of Serbia say their countries will make an official bid to host the soccer event in stadiums across the four countries.\n\nThe idea was announced on the sidelines of a regional meeting in the Black Sea resort of Varna.\n\nAlthough the 2030 contest is not officially open, South American soccer leaders are already promoting a three-way centenary bid by Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which was the original World Cup host in 1930.\n\nAlso, English soccer officials have launched a feasibility study into bidding in partnership with Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Bronson Dorsey)\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Bronson Dorsey went on a photo camping trip to Big Bend Ranch State Park in West Texas. Driving back to his Austin home, the retired architect came across a few abandoned buildings on the side of the road and felt compelled to stop for an hour and snap a few shots. It occurred to him as he returned to the road that these represented a minuscule fraction of the number of similarly neglected or forgotten structures scattered across his home state, including the ones he drove past throughout his upbringing in Bay City and Fort Worth.\n\nThus began an eight-year endeavor spanning thousands of miles, through Texas\u2019 small towns and down its dustiest, loneliest roads. Dorsey photographed hundreds of buildings ravaged by time or adapted for new uses and diligently researched their pasts, posting his findings on his blog. Now, some of those photos and accompanying stories are collected in his new book \"Lost, Texas: Photographs of Forgotten Buildings,\" published last May. We spoke with Dorsey to learn more about the genesis of the project, the insights he gained along the way, and the historic preservation movement in Texas.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nQ: Your book was a long time in the making. Did you have a sense of the scope of the project you were undertaking when you began it, or did it evolve into something larger over time?\n\nA: It was very much an evolutionary process. It really started as just a photographic project. Then somebody suggested that it might make a good book, and that intrigued me, but also scared me. It\u2019s a pretty daunting idea, to think of doing a book of any kind. I decided to start a blog and begin researching the buildings and writing a little about them, learning more about the history of not only the buildings, but the towns they were in. That was in 2011, and I finally got in front of the Texas A&M Press roughly two years ago. It had a long gestation period.\n\nI wasn\u2019t on the road all the time. I would research, find buildings, go out and photograph them, post a blog, and do it again \u2013 until I went to work on a project out in West Texas. I was by myself, so I\u2019d hop in the car on Friday after work, and head out into the wilds of West Texas and the Texas Panhandle. When I\u2019d get to places, I\u2019d find things serendipitously too, just driving down an old country road and following my nose, so to speak.\n\nQ: How did you go about uncovering and unraveling the stories of these buildings?\n\nA: There\u2019s been a publication since the 1950s called the Handbook of Texas, and as a kid growing up, we always had it in the house. Now it\u2019s on the internet and it was one of the first places I would go because there\u2019s almost nothing about the state of Texas that you cannot find on that website.\n\nThen I would dig further on the internet for county historical records and such. When that didn\u2019t prove fruitful, I tried to find someone with the local historical association or anybody that might have old local lore. Fortunately, there are genealogical records on the web, so if I had a last name and a location and approximate date, I could go in and trace somebody back.\n\nAnother interesting source of information was old Sanborn insurance maps. Sanborn was a company that would map out towns for insurance purposes and show where the buildings were and what they were constructed out of. I could frequently see the time period when a building started showing up because the maps were done every couple of years. The maps wouldn\u2019t say who owned [the building], but they would say \u201chardware store\u201d or \u201cdry goods store\u201d or something like that. These were mostly buildings built in the 1910s through the \u201830s that I was looking for.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the one place or story that stood out to you most?\n\nA: Palestine is a small town in East Texas, now [with a] population of around 20,000. The Great Northern Railroad came through the area in the 1880s and established Palestine as a regional hub of operations. They built yards in addition to passenger and freight depots, and consequently employed a lot of people. In the 1890s, they built their first hospital there, a frame building. Then around 1920, they built a new brick building \u2013 three stories with true patient rooms and operating rooms \u2013 and next door built a residence for the nurses.\n\nI was photographing [the brick building], standing with my back to the street and my eyes glued to my camera, when I heard a car pull up. I turned around, the window rolled down, and there was an elderly woman in the car. She asked what I was doing and I told her why I was photographing. She said, \u201cWell, this building is really an important place for my family.\u201d\n\nHer brother was injured while working for the railroad. My guess is this would\u2019ve been in the 1940s or 1950s. They brought him here to be looked at, and he had a pretty serious leg injury. At that time, African Americans weren\u2019t allowed in the hospital, so they operated on him on the back porch, saving his leg and saving his life. And she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a very loving, warm feeling about this building and the doctors who worked here.\u201d\n\nThat was a stunning story on its own, but it really resonated with me. You look at the building and think about the time period it was built, and how many lives it probably did impact. Because working on the railroad, whether you were in the yard or out working on the rail somewhere, was dangerous. Back when they started expanding these railroads, you\u2019d get 100 miles away from any city, and you\u2019d be lucky if you found a doctor within an hour\u2019s horseback ride that could come take care of you.\n\nQ: What were your impressions of the Rosenwald Schools you saw?\n\nA: I became aware of the Rosenwald school program before I came across one in my travels. I thought it was fascinating, the whole concept of why Julius Rosenwald wanted to help build schools throughout the South. I was able to find three to include in the book. There were two others I found that were in such disrepair that it was almost impossible to tell what they had been. But that whole program was such an incredible resource for helping African American families and communities provide their kids with an education. It was very heartening to read about his philanthropy, the processes they went through to select recipients of the funds, and these beautiful prototype buildings.\n\nRosenwald had around 12 different prototypes, all the way from a one-room to an eight-classroom with or without an auditorium, gymnasium and housing for faculty. When a community would be awarded a grant, the Rosenwald Foundation would provide the materials, and the town would have to provide the site and the labor. It was an expedient way for non-professional builders to build a school for their kids, with a predictable look and all the pieces arriving, more or less in kit form.\n\nQ: When reading your book, it\u2019s hard not to feel the weight of the loss of all of these buildings and the history they represent. How reflective is this of the state of historic preservation in Texas? Are there any things that need to change?\n\nA: Historic preservation in Texas is as robust as you would find in most parts of the country, thanks in no small part to the National Trust. I would say it largely takes place in the bigger cities \u2013 Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, San Antonio \u2013 and as you get into the smaller towns, you\u2019ll see some [preservation] that has been done but it occurs less often.\n\nThere are a lot of much smaller towns where there\u2019s nothing left to restore, or there\u2019s no economic incentive to do it. And in some cases it\u2019s too expensive to tear down, so it just sits there and declines slowly. But I was encouraged as I drove around that people are starting to see the value of these old buildings and find that it\u2019s less expensive to take an old building\u2019s shell and put a new infrastructure inside than it is to build something from scratch.\n\nThe Texas Historical Commission has done a good job of helping communities identify old buildings, determine what their previous lives were, and awarding them a medallion to recognize the building. People knowing the history of what some of these buildings were helps as an incentive for some people to choose those buildings to restore or repurpose.\n\nQ: How did the process of writing and researching the book change your view of Texas?\n\nA: A couple things really struck me. One was how this state \u2013 and it\u2019s no different than most other states \u2013 was almost entirely settled by immigrants, whether they were from a foreign country or the East Coast of the U.S. or St. Louis.\n\nThe second thing was that in spite of the fact that there were abundant resources when they came here \u2013 the forests of East Texas, stone in Central Texas, lots of building materials available with easy access \u2013 these were tough people who really had to work hard just to subsist, and the fact that they did and raised families and built farms and towns is a real testament to [their character].\n\nThen there was the dynamic role the railroad company played in building towns across the state after the Civil War and Reconstruction. The state was giving vast amounts of land to railroads as an incentive to lay their rails and help develop the places further away from the cities. Over time, this amounted to something like 34 million acres of land, far more than the railroads needed. Many of the towns prospered, but when the railroad companies left starting in the 1950s, when automobile and air travel started having a dramatic impact, it had a devastating effect on a lot of smaller towns and caused them to fold.\n\nQ: What do you want your readers to take away from your book?\n\nA: I hope they will take time to think about the people who settled their state, wherever they live. About the importance of the small towns as the economies of a state grew, the toughness of the people who left more populous places to come [there], and the fact that every building you see in the book, every abandoned building you see along a road, was an embodiment at some time of somebody\u2019s hopes and dreams, and their desire for a better life. And the remnants of these old towns, I hope, remind people of where they came from or their families came from, and that those places are worthy of being stabilized and preserved.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/11/02/texas-historic-preservation/1850434002/", "None\n\nThe expansion of the railroads in West Texas in 1910 resulted in the town of Stiles being bypassed by most traffic.

Slatten was convicted Oct. 22, 2014, of murder in the 2007 shooting that killed 14 Iraqis in Baghdad, but that conviction was eventually overturned on appeal. (Photo: Cliff Owen, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Nick Slatten already has stood on trial twice on charges that he instigated a mass shooting in Iraq.\n\nHis first trial resulted in a murder conviction that was eventually thrown out on appeal. The second ended in a hung jury.\n\nThe former Blackwater Worldwide security guard goes back on trial for a third time next week as federal prosecutors try again to convince a jury of his guilt, even though another guard said on multiple occasions that he, not Slatten, fired the opening shot. Eyewitnesses also pointed to the second guard, Paul Slough of Keller, Texas, as the initial shooter.\n\n\u201cNick is innocent,\u201d Slatten\u2019s sister, Jessica Slatten, said in a statement to USA TODAY earlier this week.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the overwhelming evidence of Nick\u2019s innocence\u2026has not been enough to stop his vindictive prosecution,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I am confident it will be enough to stop a jury from sending an innocent man to prison.\u201d\n\nOpening statements in Slatten\u2019s new trial are set for Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington. The trial is expected to run through mid-December.\n\nA key issue will again be whether the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Slatten fired the shot that touched off a deadly rampage that killed 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians and wounded 17 others.\n\nFormer Blackwater Worldwide security guard Nick Slatten. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nThe shooting happened in 2007 in Baghdad\u2019s Nisour Square during the war between Iraq and a U.S.-led coalition.\n\nSlatten, 34, of Sparta, Tennessee, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2014 for his role in the shooting. He remains incarcerated at Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Virginia, about 100 miles south of Washington.\n\nA federal appeals court threw out Slatten's conviction last year and ordered that he be given a new trial because he had not been allowed to introduce evidence that Slough fired the first shots. The government\u2019s case hinged on the allegation that Slatten was the initial shooter, the appeals court said.\n\nDuring his second trial, prosecutors argued that Slatten and other guards opened fire without provocation on innocent Iraqis and used excessive force. Slatten, prosecutors contended, fired the first shots, killing a young, unarmed Iraqi medical student.\n\nThat trial ended in a hung jury in September when jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict after 16 days of deliberations.\n\nA week later, Slatten\u2019s attorneys filed a motion asking U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth to grant their client a judgment of acquittal.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many times the government tries this case, no reasonable, unbiased jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Slatten is guilty,\u201d they argued.\n\nTo support their motion, the attorneys cited Slough\u2019s statements that he fired the opening shot, eyewitness statements that corroborated Slough\u2019s version of the events, ballistics evidence that pointed to Slough as the initial shooter, and the government\u2019s failure to offer any evidence that Slatten was even in a position to have taken the first fatal shot.\n\nNew evidence introduced during Slatten\u2019s second trial also corroborates Slatten\u2019s statements that he did not fire without provocation but that his shots were in fact directed at an armed target, the attorneys argued. State Department security agents searched the location and found eight dispensed AK-47 shells.\n\nBut Lamberth denied the motion for acquittal on Tuesday, ruling that federal prosecutors had presented evidence during the second trial that raised questions about Slough\u2019s statements that he was the initial shooter.\n\nLamberth ruled that \u201ca rational jury\u201d could accept the government\u2019s evidence and reject Slough\u2019s statements.\n\nThe deadly rampage in which Slatten was charged already has been the subject of investigations by the military, a congressional panel, the FBI and others. But details of what happened remain in dispute.\n\nSlatten and three other guards \u2013 Slough, Dustin Heard of Maryville, Tennessee, and Evan Liberty of Rochester, New Hampshire \u2013 were all former armed services members working as private security guards for Blackwater, now known as Academi. The guards\u2019 Raven 23 security team was under contract by the State Department.\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2007, their convoy traveled to a crowded traffic circle in downtown Baghdad as part of the effort to evacuate a U.S. diplomat.\n\nAt some point, the guards opened fire with machine guns and grenade launchers. They say the shooting started only after a white Kia sedan driven by the Iraqi medical student lurched out of stopped traffic and approached their four armored vehicles. The men had received intelligence reports that a white Kia might be used as a car bomb, so they feared they were under attack.\n\nNo evidence of a bomb was ever found.\n\nThe shooting heightened tensions between Washington and Baghdad and raised questions about the use of private military contractors during the war.\n\nMore: Former Blackwater security guard Nick Slatten: 'I am a POW in my own country'\n\nMore: Wife of convicted Blackwater security guard still hoping for husband's release from prison\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/02/iraqi-mass-shooting-ex-blackwater-guard-stand-trial-third-time/1823315002/", "bad url", "bad url", "CLOSE Palm helped popularize the idea of a modern smartphone with its Palm Treo, but after failing to keep up with the iPhone and Android the company has been reborn. Its new product: A 3.3-inch companion device to work alongside those phones, not replace it. USA TODAY\n\nThe new Palm next to a PalmPilot. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nIt's not exactly a trip down memory lane.\n\nAnd yet Palm's past found me wanting to embrace the newly reborn Palm, an adorable and, yes, palm-sized $349 smartphone stand-in on sale Friday as a Verizon Wireless exclusive.\n\nToo bad I couldn't.\n\nI have fond memories for the original PalmPilot, the first truly successful personal digital assistant. And equal affection for the Palm Treo, a smart early smartphone. I was even a fan of the Palm Pre, a phone with software that was, in hindsight, ahead of its time but couldn\u2019t escape the iPhone's shadow.\n\nAlas, the tug of nostalgia goes only so far, and I have real reservations about the new Palm handset I've had a chance to review. It was developed by a small San Francisco startup that has licensed the Palm name.\n\nIt looks like a phone, acts like a phone, yet Palm says it's not a phone\n\nThe new Palm company is trying to position this rounded titanium or gold device not as a throwback but as something between a connected wearable and a smartphone. In so doing, Palm wants to create a new ultramobile market segment pitched to an active, youthful crowd. They've enlisted the help of Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry in their efforts.\n\nMore: Meet the new Palm: Hint, this isn't your old PalmPilot\n\nThe way I see it, Palm and Verizon may have been onto something had they peddled the new device as a tiny standalone Android smartphone that was just that, rather than a near mini-me clone of your current smartphone.\n\nI still run into people who tell me they prefer diminutive devices, belying the trend toward phones with \u201cphablet-sized\u201d screens. The new Palm is, indeed, a cutie, small enough to get lost in a coat pocket or handbag or strapped on your arm while you\u2019re working out. You might mistake it for one of Apple's older iPod Nanos.\n\nThe problem here is that while you can leave your regular Verizon smartphone (iPhone or Android) behind when you're out and about \u2013 and that is really the point \u2013 having that regular phone in the first place is a requirement, as is the requisite Verizon data plan, on top of which you\u2019ll pay $10 a month for Palm. In essence, you\u2019re spending extra for a functional device whose functions, for the most part, duplicate what your regular smartphone already does. Only not always as well and in a far smaller form factor.\n\nI mean it makes calls, lets you text, snap pictures, listen to music, even summon the Google Assistant with the familiar \"OK, Google\" voice command. If that's not a phone, what is?\n\nNBA star Steph Curry is on the new Palm team. (Photo: JUSTIN CHUNG)\n\nBut with apologies to Steph Curry, I think Palm's odds of success are closer to an air ball than slam dunk.\n\nSharing a number\n\nTo review the new Palm, Verizon also sent me a Google Pixel 3 XL, the device with which it was paired. Palm syncs up your regular phone through a feature known as NumberShare, which allows you to make or receive calls and send and receive messages using the same phone number. Both the Palm and Pixel rang when I got a call.\n\nIncidentally, you can be on a call with your regular Verizon phone at the same time that, say, a family member is separately gabbing on your Palm.\n\nDuring the setup, I downloaded the Verizon Messages app onto the Pixel and scanned a QR code using a camera on the Palm so that the two devices were simpatico.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the same texts across the Palm and an Android phone. If you have an iPhone, however, a pretty big drawback is that you won't see any iMessages on the Palm, only SMS text messages because of the tight grip Apple keeps on its iOS-only messaging service.\n\nSpeaking of messaging, given the small size of the onscreen keyboard, I found it hard finger-typing while sending texts on the Palm. That's why you might well choose to use dictation instead.\n\nSince you\u2019re sharing the same account, you have access to the same apps on the Palm as on the phone, and you can shop the Google Play Store from the Palm, too.\n\nThe icon-driven interface on the Palm screen. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nThe layout of icons on the small 3.3-inch touch display loosely resembles an Apple Watch screen, and you can otherwise navigate through gestures and shortcuts that I sometimes found confusing.\n\nThe new Palm doesn\u2019t adopt the Graffiti shorthand language recognition system used on the Palm PDAs of yesteryear. But you can draw a letter with your finger in a gesture pad to jump to on-screen menus that begin with that letter \u2013 write an \u201cS\u201d to get to Spotify, Settings and Storage, for example.\n\nI couldn't always get to this gesture pad, however, which you\u2019re supposed to be able to access only from the lock screen.\n\nLeaving the Pixel behind, I hit the noisy streets of Manhattan with the Palm to make calls \u2013 the sound was OK through the small speaker held up to my ear, but Bluetooth headphones are a better bet. I also took a few pictures with both the 12-megapixel rear camera (with flash) on the Palm and 8MP front selfie camera. Those shots were decent, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe tinny speaker in the Palm isn\u2019t great for listening to music either \u2013 so I paired up AirPods while listening to Spotify \u2013 again, Bluetooth is the way to go (there's no headphone jack).\n\nI even watched a bit of video on the Palm, though I can\u2019t imagine doing so for for any reasonable length of time, given its diminutive display.\n\nOne feature that worked just fine: unlocking the screen with my mug through facial recognition.\n\nPalm is promising all-day battery life \u2013 I didn't do a formal test \u2013 at least when you\u2019re using a feature it calls Life Mode, which is like putting the device in a deep slumber. You won\u2019t be bothered by calls, texts and notifications when the screen is off, though you can catch up on these at any time once waking it up.\n\nThere's something to be said, I suppose, for the the digital minimalism Palm is practicing here, and the device certainly works as advertised. But as long as your megasized regular handset remains in the picture, even if it need not be with you all the time, then I think Palm and Verizon face a tall challenge persuading you to invest in a smartphone understudy.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2018/11/02/palm-review-cute-verizon-fill-your-smartphone-faces-challenges/1845398002/", "Florida Atlantic wide receiver Willie Wright (1) tries to elude the tackle of Louisiana Tech safety Darryl Lewis (38)during an NCAA college game in Boca Raton, Fla., Friday, Oct. 26, 2018. (Jim Rassol/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) \u2014 The emergence of Mississippi State's passing game was a welcome sign in last weekend's win over Texas A&M.\n\nBut it wasn't just the improvement shown by quarterback Nick Fitzgerald.\n\nThe players catching it took a big step forward as well.\n\nOsirus Mitchell and Stephen Guidry both made important plays in the win over the Aggies and No. 21 Mississippi State (5-3) needs that trend to continue through November, beginning when it hosts Louisiana Tech on Saturday.\n\nMitchell caught a team-high six passes against Texas A&M for 96 yards, including a touchdown. Guidry caught three passes for 130 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown on the Bulldogs' opening possession.\n\n\"I hadn't been in the end zone in a minute, so it felt good,\" Guidry said.\n\nGuidry also had a crucial catch during the fourth quarter when Fitzgerald ran out of the pocket on a broken play and found Guidry in the middle of the field. The 6-foot-4, 190-pounder took the ball 84 yards downfield to set up another touchdown.\n\nCoach Joe Moorhead said that was great improvisation, but it was also part design. He said there are certain rules the offense has in a scramble situation, and the execution by Fitzgerald and Guidry show the offense is growing.\n\n\"I think it goes back to the balance aspect of wanting to run and pass it with equal effectiveness and if one of the two parts are going to get shut down, being able to lean to other part,\" Moorhead said.\n\nLouisiana Tech (6-2) enters the game on a three-game winning streak, having beat UTSA, UTEP and Florida Atlantic. Louisiana Tech has already played one game against an SEC opponent this season, losing to LSU 38-21 in September.\n\n\"We have an unbelievable challenge ahead of us,\" Louisiana Tech coach Skip Holtz said. \"This is a very, very talented team.\"\n\nHere are a few things to watch when the Bulldogs host Louisiana Tech on Saturday:\n\nMORE THAN THE LINE\n\nThe defensive line \u2014 which includes stars Montez Sweat and Jeffery Simmons \u2014 gets a big chunk of the credit when discussing Mississippi State's excellent defense. But there are others around those two who are having great seasons. Linebacker Erroll Thompson is second on the team with 53 tackles and had a crucial interception in the fourth quarter of the team's win over Texas A&M. Safety Johnathan Abram leads the Bulldogs with 62 tackles.\n\nRUN NICK RUN\n\nFitzgerald might have had some success in the passing game during last week's win against Texas A&M, but there's no doubt the Bulldogs are at their best when he's also running. The quarterback owns the school record with 18 games of at least 100 yards rushing and Mississippi State has a 15-3 record in those games.\n\nTAKING CARE OF THE BALL\n\nMississippi State has had 387 consecutive rushing attempts without losing a fumble, dating back to the Egg Bowl last season. The streak includes 308 rushing attempts this season. The Bulldogs are the only team in the Football Bowl Subdivision to not lose a fumble.\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON FERGUSON\n\nMississippi State's passing game will get a test from Louisiana Tech defensive end Jaylon Ferguson. He leads the nation with 10\u00bd sacks so far this season, which gives him 38 for his career. He needs six more sacks this year to tie Terrell Suggs for the most in a college career.\n\nNO PUSHOVER\n\nLouisiana Tech has already shown that it's not a pushover for a Southeastern Conference opponent. LSU beat Louisiana Tech 38-21 in a game that was much closer than expected. LSU built a 24-0 lead in the first half before Louisiana Tech responded with 21 unanswered points. The Tigers finally pulled away late in the fourth quarter.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Susana Victoria Perez has more. Buzz60\n\nA recently released study analyzing the effects of radiation emitted from cellphones made in the 1990s suggests the devices might cause cancer, at least in male rats. (Photo: Bet_Noire, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nA government-funded study trying to understand the link between cellphones and cancer determined radiation from the devices causes cancer in male rats.\n\nThe National Toxicology Program, nominated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, observed thousands of rodents over 10 years for the $30 million project, released Thursday.\n\nMale rats exposed to radio frequency radiation like that used on 2G and 3G cellphones made in the 1990s developed cancerous tumors in their hearts. Some also had cancerous brain and adrenal gland tumors.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the link between radio frequency radiation and tumors in male rats is real, and the external experts agreed,\u201d John Bucher, NTP senior scientist, said in a statement.\n\nAny link between the radiation and tumors in female rats and mice was unclear, researchers said. Aside from cancer, the NTP reported the risk of lower body weights among newborn rats and their moms increased when exposed to high levels of the radiation during pregnancy and lactation. Still, the rodents grew to normal size, according to the data.\n\nBut the findings don't tell us much, if anything, about any possible cancer risk for humans.\n\nMore: How to know if medical studies are worth your time\n\n\u201cThe exposures used in the studies cannot be compared directly to the exposure that humans experience when using a cell phone,\u201d Bucher said.\n\nThe rats were exposed to radio frequency radiation across their entire bodies, which isn't true of how humans use cellphones (typically only holding devices against an ear or in their hands). Rats were also exposed to the high levels of radiation for long periods of time, about nine hours a day. Exposure for the rats began when they were in the womb, and at 5 to 6 weeks for mice involved in the study. The lowest exposure level used in the research equaled the maximum exposure allowed for cellphone users, according to the research.\n\nThe American Cancer Society also cast doubt on the study's implications for people.\n\n\u201cThe incidence of brain tumors in human beings has been flat for the last 40 years,\u201d said Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \u201cThat is the absolute most important scientific fact.\u201d\n\nFurther, the FDA released a statement following the findings, assuring Americans that current recommendations for cellphone radiation limits keep the public safe.\n\nMore: High price of precision medicine forces cancer patients to make agonizing choices\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY Network)\n\nDENVER \u2014 Legal pot is poised to spread further across the country this Election Day, with millions of voters casting ballots that could roll back marijuana prohibition in two states and expand access to medical cannabis in two others.\n\n\ufeffIn North Dakota, voters may approve what would be the nation's most permissive recreational marijuana laws, allowing adults to grow, consume and possess as much pot as they want, without government oversight. And in Utah, the state's conservative residents are virtually guaranteed to see medical cannabis laws approved thanks to a deal struck between legalization advocates and religious leaders staunchly opposed to even alcohol and caffeine.\n\nMeanwhile, Michiganders are widely expected to approve a system to legalize, tax and regulate recreational pot, and Missourians are considering three competing measures permitting medical use.\n\nThe ballot measures come at a time when the majority of U.S. states have already embraced some form of legal pot. Nine states permit recreational marijuana use, along with the District of Columbia. And 29 states plus D.C. permit medical marijuana use by large numbers of people. Alabama and Mississippi have also allowed its use, but by only a small number of extremely sick people.\n\nMarijuana remains entirely illegal at the federal level, although 66 percent of Americans support legal recreational cannabis, according to an October poll by Gallup.\n\n\"Clearly the national momentum is on our side and we see that in national polls, but national polls don't dictate state-level results,\" said Matthew Schweich, deputy-director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project. \"We still have a fight on our hands in every single state where we're trying to legalize.\"\n\nNORTH DAKOTA\n\nIn North Dakota, voters are considering Measure 3, which in addition to fully legalizing recreational marijuana, would also expunge many marijuana-related criminal records. Unlike many other legalization measures, however, Measure 3 does not create a system to tax and regulate marijuana sales. Instead it permits residents to grow unlimited amounts of marijuana and then sell it tax-free. In other states that have legalized pot, anyone growing marijuana for sale is strictly regulated, and the amount people can buy is tightly controlled.\n\nThe measure, which hews to libertarian ideals, also repeals any state laws addressing marijuana, which opponents say would permit stoned driving or smoking indoors. North Dakotans two years ago approved a medical marijuana system that only just got up and running this week, and many legalization advocates have been frustrated by what they saw as the slow pace to implementation.\n\nThe chance this measure could pass -- and some polls suggest it might -- has alarmed the state's political establishment because it would take effect in 30 days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wide-open, no-holds-barred, no-limits on anything, no-oversight, poorly written measure,\" said Norm Robinson, campaign manager for North Dakotans Against the Legalization of Recreational Marijuana.\n\nThe measure's backers say they're comfortable the proposal's language accomplishes their goals of broad legalization with little government intervention. Defense attorneys across the state are already asking judges to postpone sentencing in marijuana-related cases, arguing their clients will get their records expunged automatically if the measure passes.\n\nUTAH\n\nUtah's marijuana debate has drawn national attention to a battle between the pro-legalization Utah Patients Coalition and the powerful Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which opposes the plan. However, a last-minute compromise brokered among the church, initiative backers and the state's political establishment has laid the groundwork for medical pot in Utah regardless of whether Prop. 2 passes. Utah has about 3 million residents.\n\nMarijuana products and plants on display at The Green Solution dispensary in Denver, Colorado. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY Network)\n\n\"There's a lot of voters who support marijuana in principle but didn't want to go in opposition of the LDS church,\" Schweich said. \"The important thing about Utah is that we have made a compromise with our opponents.\"\n\nUp until a few weeks ago, Utah's measure enjoyed strong support, but that eroded as the LDS church formally opposed the plan and opponents began running highly critical radio ads warning this was a step toward full legalization.\n\nThe two sides then agreed on a more conservative compromise measure that state legislators will take up soon after the election. Under Utah law, lawmakers are free to amend or repeal voter-approved ballot measures, and Schweich said the compromise ensures something will pass regardless of the actual public vote outcome.\n\nMore than 60 percent of the state's residents are LDS members, and are taught to avoid alcohol, coffee and most kinds of tea, along with tobacco and illegal drugs. The church maintains a powerful influence over the state's government, but LDS leaders agreed to the compromise measure that bans residents from growing their own cannabis, and tries to establish a state-run medical marijuana distribution network. Smoking cannabis would remain illegal under the measure, but sick people would be able to eat marijuana-infused foods or use vape pens.\n\nSchweich said the compromise plans provide a clear path forward, even if voters reject Prop. 2: \"They're better than nothing, and they provide a path to access to patients and a path on which we can build for the future.\"\n\nMICHIGAN\n\nMichigan\u2019s Proposal 1 enjoys strong support, according to a Detroit Free Press poll, with as much as 57 percent of voters in favor. Michigan voters legalized medical marijuana in 2008. Neighboring Canada on Oct. 17 legalized marijuana sales for adults, adding additional pressure on Michigan to follow its lead.\n\nOpponents say Michigan voters need to consider the long-term implications of their decision, and suggest the tax revenues will fall far short of funding increased drug-treatment and campaigns to keep kids from using cannabis. Proposal 1 creates a system to regulate, tax and sell marijuana to adults.\n\n\"I wonder if there would be anything left for Michigan other than a bad policy that will affect the state for decades to come,\" said Scott Greenlee, director of Healthy and Productive Michigan, a group opposing the ballot proposal.\n\nMore: Michigan's legal weed, anti-gerrymandering, voter access proposals lead big\n\n\n\nMISSOURI\n\nIn Missouri, voters are choosing between three plans: Amendment 2, Amendment 3 and Prop. C. All three would legalize growing, manufacturing, selling and consuming marijuana and marijuana products for medicinal use at the state level. Under state law, the measure that gets the most votes goes into effect, and the Constitutional amendments would trump the proposition.\n\nProp C would tax marijuana sales at 2 percent; proceeds would be split four ways to fund veterans health care, public safety, drug treatment programs and early childhood development initiatives. Amendment 2 would tax marijuana sales at 4 percent, with the resulting proceeds going to fund veterans health care programs. This is the only proposal that would allow for home-growing of marijuana.\n\nKennya Anderson of Chicago passes a joint to her friend as marijuana smoke trickles from her lips during the Denver 420 rally. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY Network)\n\nAmendment 3 would tax sales by growers to dispensaries at $9.25 per ounce for marijuana flowers and $2.75 per ounce for leaves and would tax sales by dispensaries to patients at 15 percent. The proceeds \u2014 projected to be by far the most of the three measures \u2014 would go toward setting up a research institute and efforts to cure currently incurable diseases, with money set aside to acquire land for the institute's campus and to fund transportation infrastructure, medical care, public pensions and income tax refunds.\n\nMore: Have questions about your medical marijuana votes in Missouri?

(Photo: Broward County Sheriff's Office via AP)\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Cesar Sayoc, the Florida man accused of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump, will be transferred to New York to face federal charges, a judge ruled Friday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres ordered Sayoc to be transferred after his lawyers waived a Friday hearing on the removal issue, saying it's in his best interest to have the hearing in New York.\n\nSayoc, 56, is accused of sending 15 improvised explosive devices by mail to targets in New York and other locations. He was arrested last Friday at an auto parts store.\n\nFBI officials say the alleged targets included former President Barack Obama, presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, former CIA director John Brennan, Sen. Cory Booker, of New Jersey, Rep. Maxine Water, D-Calif., billionaire philanthropist and donor George Soros, and actor and director Robert De Niro, among others.\n\nNone of the bombs exploded, and no one was injured.\n\nProsecutors said evidence shows Sayoc began planning the attacks as early as mid-July while he was living in the Miami area in his white van, which is covered with images of Trump and posters critical of top Democrats and the media.\n\nInvestigators searched a laptop in the van and allegedly found lists of addresses that match the labels on the bombs that were mailed from South Florida.\n\nThey also found repeated copies of return labels with the same address and misspelling of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s name as the return labels on the bomb packages. The return labels had the same typeface, font and font size as the packages, prosecutors said in court filings.\n\nWhile searching the laptop and Sayoc\u2019s cellphone, investigators also found internet searches for addresses of the targets and their families.\n\nIn addition, documents on the laptop contained addresses for \u201cnumerous additional targets,\u201d prosecutors said. Those targets were not named, but officials said they have all been notified by the FBI.\n\n\"Put simply, only the defendant\u2019s arrest and incapacitation resulting from his detention were sufficient to stop his attack,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a letter to the court.\n\nSayoc\u2019s defense attorneys called the prosecution\u2019s evidence in a criminal complaint \u201cflimsy stuff.\u201d\n\nHe is being held at the federal detention center in downtown Miami.\n\nSayoc, who has been living in his van for much of the last decade, listed his mother\u2019s Aventura condominium as his residence. He\u2019s been estranged from his family for years, a family lawyer said.\n\nFamily members have described Sayoc as a mentally disturbed individual who refused requests to seek help. Acquaintances say his obsession with Republican politics only began in the last few years.\n\nFor years, Sayoc has struggled to maintain friendships or hold a steady job, bouncing from one gig to the next. He\u2019s worked as a pizza delivery driver, in strip clubs and at a dry cleaning business.\n\nSayoc, whose mother is Italian and father is Filipino, has falsely misrepresented his family history, claiming to be a member of the Seminole tribe.\n\nFederal officials, in calling for him to be kept behind bars, pointed to Sayoc\u2019s criminal history dating back to 1991 for alleged theft and drug offenses.\n\nIn 2002, he was sentenced to a year of probation after he screamed at a Florida Power and Light employee on the phone, threatening to \u201cblow up FPL\u201d in a manner \u201cworse than Sept. 11.\u201d Court records show he was angry about an electric bill.\n\nMore: Mail bomb suspect had planned attacks since July, had shipping labels to targets saved on laptop, prosecutors say\n\nMore: What we know about Cesar Sayoc, the Florida man suspected of mailing more than a dozen bombs\n\nStanglin reported from McLean, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/02/cesar-sayoc-pipe-bomb-suspect-court-bail-removal-hearing/1856199002/", "CLOSE Misty Copeland premieres Disney's \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.\" Copeland recently announced she would be cutting short her season with the American Ballet Theatre to deal with an unspecified family tragedy.

Buzz60\n\nConfidence is a beautiful thing. Especially when discussing the stability of your financial future. But not all financial confidence is equal. (Photo: FOTOKITA, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nYou\u2019re good and you know it. At least that's what you imagine yourself saying into the mirror each morning. Confidence is a beautiful thing. Especially when you can be confident in the stability of your financial future.\n\nIn fact, the two are linked. When your financial behavior is stable and perpetual, it creates enjoyment in you and sparks the confidence that comes with it. That's financial wellness.\n\nWith that said, we now must face the realities of not being financially well.\n\nWhen confidence and behavior-driven financial stability are misaligned, there is trouble. Having confidence in a good situation is great. Being overconfident in a bad situation, lacking confidence with a terrible reality and lacking confidence when you should enjoying your financial situation? Those scenarios are trouble.\n\nWhere do you think you fall?\n\nOverconfidence in one\u2019s financial trajectory is the most common sin I see. It convinces you that your horse will win the race when, in fact, your horse didn\u2019t even qualify for the race and is sitting in the stable being passive-aggressively brushed. This overconfidence is usually tied to having a high income. And while you might not care that a seven-figure earner can still be financially unhealthy, they can. So can people who are highly educated or were raised by parents who are financially well off. A lack of debt and a respectable savings account can also con a person into being too confident.\n\nHaving confidence in a situation when you shouldn\u2019t doesn't mean you are mentally strong, it more likely means you're delusional. People in this category generally have the resources to attain justified confidence but only after consistent, healthy financial behaviors are adopted. You can try to be that one person who out-earns a complete lack of resourcefulness. Good luck with that.\n\nMore: Pete the Planner: How to retire successfully when starting from scratch at age 50\n\nMore: Starting a retirement plan at age 50 with only a $30K salary? Success possible, if lucky\n\nMore: Pete the Planner: Long-term health care costs blow up couple's retirement planning\n\nCLOSE A recent study from finance company Northwestern Mutual shows the average American now has $38,000 in debt, not including mortgages. Buzz60's Sean Dowling has more. Buzz60\n\nThe second confidence quandary is a lack of confidence in a bad situation. There\u2019s actually nothing wrong with this. The problem arrives when you don\u2019t do anything about it. The moment early in our marriage when my wife and I found ourselves with more than $3,000 in credit card debt, realized we were in trouble and began to pay it off aggressively wasn\u2019t a confidence low point. It was a high point. The low point was the inaction which preceded the action.\n\nIf your financial life is bad and you know it, then your sustained effort to shift your reality creates the path to an actual confident financial life. Yes, it will take time. But once the plans are in place and healthy behaviors are established, it's just a matter of time.\n\nWhich brings us to an unnecessarily frustrating scenario for those who experience it \u2013 a lack of confidence in excellent financial behaviors. The daily grind can be hard and it can wear a person down. I find this is especially true for people who are drowning in student loan debt. Even if you\u2019re doing everything right, student loans can take a decade to pay off. That\u2019s a long time to divert your income from financing your present lifestyle to pay for your past. But consider that, once you\u2019re free and clear of the debt, you\u2019ve trained yourself to live on less. This is when you redirect the newly recaptured cash flow toward your future, which can then result in a brilliant financial life.\n\nCLOSE Studies have shown that nice people have bad finances and researchers finally think they know why. Buzz60's Tony Spitz has the details. Buzz60\n\nOne measure of what constitutes these good financial behaviors I keep referencing is measuring the efficiency of your income. If at least 35 percent of your gross income is going toward asset accumulation and/or debt liquidation, then you\u2019re income is efficiently growing your net worth. For a deeper dive into this calculation, which I call Power Percentage, mosey on over to PeteThePlanner.com/Power-Percentage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the fun in having a healthy financial life if you can\u2019t enjoy confidence in it? In your search for this answer, you might find the relationship between your reality and the confidence you place in it might actually be the problem.\n\nPeter Dunn is an author, speaker and radio host, and he has a free podcast: \"Million Dollar Plan.\" Have a question for Pete the Planner?

But poor isn't undesirable, it's someone looking for opportunity.\n\nA Honduran migrant near Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, on Oct. 21, 2018. (Photo: Orlando Sierra/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nI never met my great-grandfather on my mother\u2019s side, but I knew his house: a white one-and-a-half story one-bedroom on a small-town gravel road. I spent part of every summer and Christmas vacation there growing up. The attic served as a make-shift bedroom for me, my sister and my parents as it had for his four children, and later for my mom, her sister and two brothers after my grandfather gained ownership.\n\nThe house sat at the top of a steep hill, which was planted with Concord grape vines, harvested to make jelly and sometimes wine. My grandparents, and likely my great grandparents before them, kept a large garden to feed their family. My mother remembers they also kept chickens, which she despised.\n\nMy great-grandfather brought his wife and three children and their \u201cimmigrant trunk\u201d across the Atlantic from what was then Bohemia. He was a butcher by trade. My grandfather, born here, was a carpenter. My mother earned a degree in journalism and worked as a reporter. One of her brothers became a college president after serving in the military. My daughters are both college graduates, gainfully employed.\n\nOpportunities for immigrants lead to success\n\nI tell this story not because it is remarkable, but because it is not. America has prospered on the principle that giving people opportunity will result in success.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security recently published a proposed rule that says immigrants seeking to enter and stay in the U.S. must show they will not need public benefits. Reading this \"public charge\" proposal is like looking at America in a funhouse mirror. It distorts the role and nature of immigration in our country until it is unrecognizable, and concludes that the only good immigrant is someone who has already succeeded.\n\nHad this rule been published to address a rash of welfare fraud or high public benefit usage rates by immigrants, the 183 pages detailing multiple factors that must now be documented and weighed (among them age, medical conditions, family status, employment status, assets, resources, education, skills and whether they have ever received public aid), could have been justified. But this is not the case.\n\nMore: Don't punish immigrants who use public assistance. I went broke waiting for a work permit.\n\nTrump administration wants to deny immigrants entry if they need public benefits\n\nBring more refugees to America. They'll fill vacant jobs and boost our economy.\n\nOne study showing immigrants use more in public benefits relative to native-born was done by the Center for Immigration Studies, which aims to limit immigration. The Cato Institute found the opposite \u2014 that immigrants are less likely to use public benefits, and that they use lower amounts. It said the CIS study inflated usage because it was based not on individuals but on households headed by immigrants, and those often include people like spouses and children who are native-born.\n\nWould I be here today had the proposed public charge rule been in effect when my great grandfather arrived? Unlikely. I am proud of him for taking the risk. I am grateful for his hard work (and my great grandmother's, too) that allowed his progeny to achieve and thrive, as well as pay plenty in taxes to Uncle Sam. Seeing the people now standing in his place being called a burden is sad not only on a personal level, but for our country.\n\nI believe that people like my great-grandfather are necessary for America to maintain her character and energy. With only a few exceptions, our laws already limit immigration to those with close family ties or job offers \u2014 good indicators that they will not be a burden \u2014 and require legally binding Affidavits of Support in most cases as a backstop in case something goes wrong.\n\nWe must all tell our stories to stop this\n\nThe fact that people use legally available help at some time after they arrive does not mean our immigration system has failed. It means that for immigrants, like those born here, life happens. Helping people is part of giving them the opportunity to succeed.\n\nWe can all think of people who may be shut out by this rule if implemented as proposed: the woman not allowed to work in her home country because of tradition or discrimination, the widow coming to help raise her grandchildren, the couple prevented from starting a business because personal loans are not available in their home country, the family who would be forced to leave behind their child with a disability. Denying these people entry will make us poorer, not richer in any sense of the word.\n\nTo have any chance to keep the proposed public charge rule from taking effect as written we must all tell our stories. Share them on Twitter with the hashtag #MyImmigrantHistory. You can also submit comments to the government through Dec. 10.\n\nWe owe it to our ancestors, ourselves and generations to come to remind America that poor does not equal undesirable. To the contrary, the future success of our nation will continue to arrive \u2014 if we let it \u2014 with three children and an immigrant trunk.\n\nLori Chesser is an immigration attorney based in Des Moines and member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Jones, CEO of PRRI, a nonpartisan research organization, said interest among faith leaders is in line with findings from the group\u2019s new survey that found more people of faith plan to vote this midterm.\n\n\"We\u2019re seeing a rise in interest in this election compared to 2014, but it\u2019s a rise across the board among the religious and the nonreligious, across race and across party,\" said Jones. \"One thing I think Trump\u2019s presidency has done is it has hardened the partisan divides in the country. That has led to churches and congregations that I think are more behind President Trump\u2019s agenda feeling like, 'We have to get behind the president here,' and groups on the other side saying, \u2018Oh, no, no. We have to get out here and defeat the Republican Party in the midterms and try to unseat President Trump in 2020.'\"\n\nAccording to the PRRI American Values survey released Monday, 54 percent of respondents said they plan to vote.\n\nAmong faith groups, 67 percent of African-American Protestants said they are \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d to vote compared to 55 percent of white Evangelicals voters and 57 of white mainline Protestants, said Jones.\n\nHe noted that less than half of Latino Catholics and Protestants said they will vote, compared to white Catholics at 63 percent.\n\nThe survey, which polled 2,509 people over 18 years old from Sept. 17 to Oct. 1, had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.\n\nJones said the get-out-the-vote effortsof faith organizations is part of an uptick among all groups. \u201cThey\u2019re more riding a wave, than creating one,\u201d he said.\n\nKasar Abdulla wears an \"I voted\" and \"#MyMuslimVote\" sticker after early voting at Casa Azafran for a \"Vote Together Party\" hosted by the American Muslim Advisory Council Friday, Oct. 26, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn.

Benitez said, unlike in the African-American community, there\u2019s not a long history in Latino communities of turning to churches to boost turnout.\n\nStill, faith was a key factor.\n\n\u201cWe know that for a lot of Latinos faith is important,\u201d said Benitez. \u201cThis is meaningful in a community of voters that have had historically lower voter turnout. Some of that has to do with challenges of time, information and accessibility. So we wanted to be able to reach people in a way that connects very deeply and personally with them and then help them overcome those challenges through faith.\u201d\n\nThis year, Americans are riveted on the outcome of the midterm elections, which are held between the presidential elections, more so than in other years.

(AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 The amateur boxing federation struck down a proposed amendment on Friday that would have allowed the body's president to take an extended leave of absence, dealing a blow to the interim leader's election campaign.\n\nThe amendment was proposed in an effort to calm tensions with the International Olympic Committee, which has objected to the candidacy of businessman Gafur Rakhimov.\n\nRakhimov, who has been running AIBA on an interim basis since January, is one of two candidates in Saturday's presidential election.\n\nThe IOC has said Rakhimov regaining the presidency could put AIBA's place in the Olympics at risk.\n\nRakhimov is on a U.S. Treasury Department sanctions list for alleged links to organized crime and international heroin trafficking. The sanctions bar U.S. citizens and companies from doing business with him. He has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAIBA executive director Tom Virgets said Rakhimov was planning a lawsuit to demand he's removed from the list.\n\n\"The actual court piece itself is relatively short. It's getting on the docket and getting a date to be heard is what has been taking some time,\" Virgets said. \"He is very optimistic, based on what his lawyers have said, that he could see this in the very near future.\"\n\nThe amendment which would make it easier to take an extended absence fell two votes short of a two-thirds majority. Rakhimov had hinted he'd use the measure if elected to step aside while mending relations with the IOC, but also keeping AIBA voting rights.\n\nAnother high-profile measure to give vice presidencies to people who invest $10 million was adjourned without a vote.\n\nRakhimov, who is from Uzbekistan, is running against Serik Konakbayev of Kazakhstan for the AIBA presidency.\n\nRakhimov presented himself on Friday as AIBA's savior, saying he restructured $40 million of debt and lifted a threat of bankruptcy since becoming interim president. Rakhimov said two major debts to investors had been converted into sponsorship deals, but didn't say how.\n\n\"I was able to get most of the credit against AIBA waived,\" Rakhimov said, adding that \"to think that we almost had to dissolve our organization and file for bankruptcy is unthinkable.\"\n\nAIBA still faces a huge debt following the 11-year reign of former president C.K. Wu, who stepped down last year. AIBA banned him for life last month for \"gross negligence and financial mismanagement.\"\n\nAccounts presented on Friday showed negative equity of $19 million as of June after years of heavy spending and an opaque failed commercial venture. Its assets are valued at less than $4 million after years in decline.\n\nVirgets said the negative equity \"is an ugly, ugly figure but it is the reality of AIBA.\"\n\nBesides Rakhimov's alleged ties to criminal groups and AIBA's finances, the IOC has complained about the association's refereeing and judging after more controversial bouts at the 2016 Olympics.\n\nVirgets said AIBA was cracking down on doping with increased drug-testing, and this year had resolved 38 long-running doping cases, some going back to 2010. However, he said the fighters involved wouldn't be named, even if they had failed drug tests.\n\n\"Those cases that we were resolving from years ago, other than to mention the fact that we have closed the cases, we have no intention of making it public who those individuals are,\" he said.\n\nThe IOC has said it could keep boxing on the 2020 Olympic program but remove a role for AIBA, though it's not clear how that might work.\n\nAIBA's financial woes could deepen if it loses its cut of Olympic TV money. The IOC has suspended payments to AIBA and did not let Rakhimov attend the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires last month.\n\nKonakbayev is positioning himself as the IOC-friendly candidate.\n\n\"If (Rakhimov) wins, the IOC will take a tough decision which won't make us happy,\" Konakbayev told The Associated Press on Thursday. \"We could lose participation as an Olympic sport in the Olympic Games in Tokyo. That's the scariest thing, and we should all think about that.\"\n\nKonakbayev made the ballot only after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled his nominations were in fact valid despite an earlier attempt by AIBA to exclude him.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Yes, China\u2019s largest city has an old Jewish quarter. As in many cities around the world, relatively few Jews live in the old Jewish quarter any more.\n\nOur tour guide tells us the backstory. In the late 1930s, Jews fleeing Nazi persecution had few options. Shamefully, the United States and other leading powers closed their borders to all but a trickle of the refugees. Roughly 20,000 European Jews made their way to Shanghai, one of the only places that would accept them.\n\nOld Jewish quarter of Shanghai. With the outbreak of World War II, Japanese troops took control of the city, and most of the Jews were forced into what became known as the Shanghai ghetto.

Jews rarely do.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Japanese troops took control of the city, and most of the Jews were forced into what became known as the Shanghai ghetto. Japan\u2019s German allies pressed for their extermination, either by poison gas or by putting them on ships to be bombed at sea. But, unlike in Europe\u2019s ghettos, the plans for mass murder were never carried out.\n\nPlaque marking the former Shanghai home of Michael Blumenthal, a Jewish refugee who'd become a U.S. Treasury secretary under President Jimmy Carter.

Michael Blumenthal, went to America, where he went on to serve as Treasury secretary in the Carter administration. We see a plaque on the house at 59 Chusan Road, where Blumenthal lived after he came to China from Germany at age 13.\n\nIt is Saturday, Oct. 27, and we are back in the United States, a place Jews have considered safe harbor ever since President George Washington sent a letter, in 1790, to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island.

He managed to survive Auschwitz-Birkenau, the notorious Nazi killing complex in Poland where more than 1 million people were slaughtered during World War II. Henry, who lost his mother and five sisters in the Holocaust, survived being shot in the head during an escape attempt and was down to 75 pounds when U.S. troops found him in 1945.\n\nHe, too, came to America after the war. He started a family, operated a dry-cleaning business, and later volunteered at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, where he would show visitors the number he was given at Auschwitz \u2014 A18991 \u2014 tattooed on his arm.\n\nAt the shiva service, several mourners agree that it was for the best that Henry didn\u2019t live to hear about the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.

USA TODAY\n\nFormer National Teacher of the Year Jahana Hayes is likely to win her bid next week for Congress. Here, Hayes laughs with supporters after speaking on a panel in September for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. (Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY)\n\nFor decades, said Craig Hoxie, there\u2019s been a joke in education that goes something like this:\n\nThose who can, teach. And those who can\u2019t, legislate.\n\nHoxie, who teaches physics and sports science at Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, laughed when he repeated the line. But it\u2019s not actually that funny, he said, because of the sobering truth behind it.\n\nIn the spring, when Hoxie and other teachers across the state walked out of Oklahoma classrooms demanding better pay, he thought of that joke. He thought of it again on the 110-mile march from Tulsa to Oklahoma City, as teachers rallied at the capitol for more money for education. That\u2019s when he realized: If he wanted things to be different, he had to get involved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always telling my students that to change things, they\u2019ve gotta join the revolution,\u201d said Hoxie, now in his 19th year of teaching. \u201cAnd then I was like, \u2018Well, I guess I\u2019ve gotta lead it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Hoxie, a 49-year-old Democrat with no previous political experience, found himself running for Oklahoma state representative. After beating another educator in the June primary, Hoxie has juggled lesson planning and knocking doors, balanced grading papers with making lawn signs, all in an effort to unseat Republican incumbent Terry O\u2019Donnell.\n\nAnd he\u2019s far from the only educator getting involved.\n\nTeachers have been in the news for months, as a profession in crisis gains public support after a wave of cuts to education. Lately, educators have been fighting back.\n\nFirst, they protested. Earlier this year teachers staged statewide strikes in West Virginia, Arizona and Oklahoma, and they rallied in Kentucky, North Carolina and Colorado, closing some of the biggest schools. In September, teachers in about a dozen Washington state districts walked off the job as classes resumed, though many soon went back to work.\n\nNow, teachers are running for political office \u2013 in staggering numbers.\n\nTeachers on the ballot: 1 in 4 statehouse races\n\nEducators in high-profile races include Jahana Hayes, the 2016 national teacher of the year, a Democrat who is likely headed to Congress to represent Connecticut\u2019s 5th District. Former chemistry teacher Chrissy Houlahan, who got her start with Teach for America, is trying to turn Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th District blue. In Wisconsin, lifelong educator Tony Evers is taking on Republican incumbent Scott Walker in the governor\u2019s race, after Walker pushed a law that gutted the state\u2019s teachers unions. (Walker insists he reformed education in his state, allowing schools to pay good teachers on merit.)\n\n\u201cThis is reaction not to just teachers not having a voice, but the fact that we\u2019re seeing the national discourse move away from education,\u201d said Houlahan, an Air Force veteran who called teaching \u201cthe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, hands down.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruth, facts, science \u2013 those matter,\u201d she added. \u201cIf we don\u2019t educate, we\u2019re going to continue to be a divided nation.\u201d\n\nDecisions about money for education are made at the state level, which means teachers\u2019 infusing state legislative ranks could have a profound effect on classrooms. According to the National Education Association, 1,455 educators are running in 6,066 state legislative races on Tuesday. That means someone with an education background \u2013 from classroom teachers to support staff to college professors \u2013 is running in nearly 1 in 4 statehouse races.\n\nTeachers running for office is nothing new, but this scale is unprecedented, said Campbell Scribner, an education historian at the University of Maryland. For instance, more than 300 members of the American Federation of Teachers union are running for office \u2014 triple the number that ran in 2014 or 2016.\n\n\u201cAmericans have always looked to schools to fix social problems,\u201d Scribner said. \u201cSo teachers are in a unique position to win because people care about schools.\u201d\n\nTeachers across the country say they\u2019re running for many other reasons, too.\n\n\u201cWe see every day the impact of the opioid crisis,\u201d said Tim Barnsback, a middle school engineering teacher and Democrat running for state representative for the second time in Morganton, North Carolina. Most of the children in foster care in his district are there because of their parents\u2019 heroin or opioid use. \u201cTeachers are on the battlegrounds fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just fed up.\u201d\n\nWhen Hayes first got into the congressional race in Connecticut \u2013 ultimately advancing after a tough, close primary \u2013 many told her she couldn\u2019t win because she was a single-issue candidate.\n\n\u201cI definitely begged to differ,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWhen you have kids in your classroom who can\u2019t learn because they\u2019re worrying about adult problems, because someone lost their job and now they have to move, or they have an allergy but can\u2019t get an EpiPen because their parents can\u2019t afford it, those scenarios are playing out in teachers\u2019 minds, while other people just see numbers on a budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeachers have a front row seat to the future, and no one is asking us what we see and what we need.\u201d\n\nOct. 17: We followed 15 of America's teachers. No matter where they work, they feel disrespect\n\nDeVos' appointment 'woke up the storm'\n\nTeaching, a profession typically dominated by women, has a history in politics: Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th president of the United States, was a high school teacher before becoming a congressional aide and ultimately running for office.\n\nBut while men have a tendency to use education as a stepping stone, said Scribner, the education historian, women often get to elected office and become leading national voices on education. This is particularly true in many western states, he added, where women could run for school board before they could vote.\n\nA former preschool teacher, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, got involved in politics after arguing that a preschool program shouldn\u2019t be eliminated from the state budget. When a local lawmaker told her she couldn\u2019t do anything about it because she was just a \u201cmom in tennis shoes,\u201d Murray responded by running for, and winning, positions in the school board, Washington state Senate and, ultimately, the United States Senate. Murray believes educators don\u2019t just make great candidates, but also ideal legislators, because of their extensive background in collaborative learning.\n\nShe\u2019s also not surprised to see so many teachers on the ballot.\n\nThe appointment of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos \u201cwoke up the storm,\u201d Murray said.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos on Capitol Hill on June 5, 2018. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nDeVos, a school-choice advocate who favors some privatization efforts, was protested across the country, and her confirmation required a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\u201cTeachers have been promised everything for so long, and they\u2019ve seen the devastating effect of cuts in their classroom. They see the lack of respect public education is getting,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThis has been building for a while.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the thousands of educators running next week are Democrats, roughly 30 percent of educators running in state legislative races are Republicans. That includes Toni Hasenback, a 7th grade English teacher in Elgin, Oklahoma. Hasenback actually ran for office in 2016, too, losing her primary by 93 votes.\n\nEducation, Hasenback said, is \u201cthe one industry that touches everybody.\u201d And it is not a partisan issue.\n\nOklahoma is in a unique position with almost 60 educators running for state office in the general election. During this year\u2019s walkout, teachers across the state realized political change was the only way to avoid future demonstrations, said Katherine Bishop, vice president of the Oklahoma Teachers Association.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an awakening,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cEducators have always known they need to raise their hand and their voice to make a difference. But now we see we have to do that outside of the school buildings. We have to take it to the capitol.\u201d\n\nMelissa Provenzano, a 14-year educator who is running as a Democrat for House District 79 in Tulsa, has spent the last decade balancing budgets as a high school administrator. Every year since 2009, she\u2019s had to make devastating cuts. \u201cWe are down to the bone,\u201d she said. Like many educators running for office, her campaign is staffed largely by volunteer teachers, as well as some former students.\n\nShould any of the 60 Oklahoma candidates win their election, state law will require them to resign from their teaching jobs to serve in government. This could put the Sooner state in a bind, said Hoxie. Oklahoma, where recruiting teachers is sometimes a challenge, is not equipped to fill all those positions. Hoxie, for example, estimates he is the only instructor in a 500-mile radius qualified to teach International Baccalaureate sports exercise and health science.\n\nElsewhere, teachers are making plans with long-term subs.\n\nIf Christine Marsh, the 2016 Arizona teacher of the year and a candidate for state Senate, wins a seat in Phoenix, her supervisor from her student-teaching days plans to come out of retirement and take over her classes during the legislative session.\n\nChristine Marsh speaks to the crowd during a \"Now it Starts\" rally on May 19, 2016, in Phoenix, Arizona. The rally was to put pressure on leaders to focus on money for education. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)\n\nMarsh finds the number of teachers running for office inspiring. But if she\u2019s being honest, it\u2019s also a little disheartening.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, politicians would be taking care of business, and our students would be valued,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be able to close our doors and teach. But that\u2019s not happening, so we have to step up.\u201d\n\nNo matter what happens Tuesday, having this many teachers on the ballot proves \u201cregular people have a place in government,\u201d said Hayes, the Connecticut candidate for Congress. Going forward, they could aim higher, as they\u2019ve always told their students to do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve proven we can fight, and I believe we\u2019re going to win,\u201d Hoxie said. \u201cAnd someday, maybe even within 10 years, we\u2019re going to put a teacher in the White House.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/02/vote-teacher-education-ballot-election/1849995002/", "CLOSE Democrats are hoping for a 'blue wave' in the midterm elections, but they are defending more seats than they are challenging.

More than 80 percent of white evangelical voters said they'll vote for their Republican candidate for Congress on Tuesday, according to a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI).\n\nBut will that voting bloc remain reliable for the right for years to come?

But today's young voters grew up in a more secular America with more cultural diversity, said Molly Worthen, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina specializing in American religious history.\n\nSome are simply exhausted by their parents' politics, she explains.\n\n\"They are put off by the sense that the old-school moral-majority style of culture-warrior politics means a conservative white evangelical is always spoiling for a fight, is intolerant and unwilling to listen to differing opinions,\" Worthen said. \"All of that runs counter to the broad message that evangelical young people have absorbed from the culture.\"\n\nPolitical identities are hard to shake\n\nStudents cheer and sing as Liberty University's student band, \"Liberty Worship Collective,\" opens a convocation ceremony in the Vines Center on Sept. 26.

More than three-quarters of them plan to vote Republican on Tuesday.\n\nPolitics is a lot about identity, not issues, and changing identity is difficult, said Stephanie Martin, an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University who specializes in public discourses of conservative social movements.\n\n\"Their parents may buy wholly into the idea that the Republican Party is the party of family values, and a young evangelical might see through that, might see it as a ruse, but still be a Republican because that was the culture and the milieu and the way of being in the world that they grew up in,\" she said. \"The likelihood that they're going to break from that is pretty low.\"\n\nConservatives: Candace Owens\u2019 rapid rise defending two of America\u2019s most complicated men: Trump and Kanye\n\nLuke Dillard, a 22-year-old Liberty senior who voted for Trump, couches his political views with a preamble about his faith and upbringing in a conservative household. He believes abortion is murder and holds the Bible's man-and-woman view on marriage.\n\n\"They're, like, super-conservative,\" he said of his parents. \"I wouldn't say that I'm full-on, hard-core conservative.\"\n\nLike Dillard, senior Amari Mitchell uses her childhood to support her views. Except she was raised a Democrat, voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and finds no trouble uniting her political beliefs and her faith.\n\n\"I just keep my belief in God,\" she said.\n\nDillard, who is white, and Mitchell, who is black, exemplify the drastic political split between white and non-white evangelicals. The difference is so stark that it's imperative the groups be separated when studying them, said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI.\n\nLiberty University students shuffle to their next class. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USAT)\n\nWhile the large majority of white evangelicals voted for Trump in 2016, black Protestants voted 96 percent for Clinton, according to Pew.\n\n\"There's a fundamental divide in evangelical America with regard to race,\" said Janelle Wong, a professor of American studies at the University of Maryland. \"In some ways, on many issues, white evangelicals couldn't be more different from Asian-American, Latino and black evangelicals.\n\nImmigration: Outrage erupts over Trump campaign ad blaming Democrats for immigrant who 'killed our people'\n\n\"Oftentimes in their ethnic communities, they're not the dominant group,\" she said. \"They are socialized in these places that have become very blue.\"\n\nTrevor Thomas, a 25-year-old Liberty graduate student who wrote in Sen.

That number is now 15 percent, according to PRRI, and the remaining ranks are held together by a graying group. The median age of white evangelicals is getting older and is now 56.\n\nMeanwhile, just 8 percent of those 18-29 identify as white evangelical, according to PRRI.\n\n\"It's a small, small group, particularly if you're going after younger voters,\" Jones said. \"From a strategy point of view, there are richer targets out there.\"\n\nOprah: Winfrey says if you don't vote, you are 'dishonoring your family' at Stacey Abrams rally\n\nSo will the GOP face a reckoning at the ballot box?\n\nNot quite yet.\n\n\"The religious right, as a network of very savvy political institutions, will continue to punch above its weight politically for decades,\" Worthen said. \"Even as we see that secularizing trend persist, it will not likely immediately translate to a huge turnout of votes for progressive political candidates.\"\n\nJones agrees that white Christians are \"over-represented at the ballot box.\"\n\n\"The ballot box acts a little bit like a time machine that takes us back about 10 years in terms of the composition of this country,\" he said. \"White Christian Americans tend to vote at a pretty high rate.\"\n\nOpinion: Evangelicals are paying high moral price for anti-abortion gains.

USA TODAY\n\nThe first pieces of plastic trash captured by the Ocean Cleanup system once it was put into place in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in mid-October, 2018. They include two plastic crates, five discarded fishing nets and several bottles and other plastic debris. (Photo: Ocean Cleanup)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Cleaning up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, estimated to contain as much as 142 thousand tons of plastic garbage spread over an area that covers a million square miles, is no small task. But it starts with scooping up two white plastic crates, some plastic bottles and five discarded commercial fishing nets.\n\nThat was the first trash captured by a 2,000-foot floating boom hauled deep into the middle of the Pacific Ocean in the middle of October by The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch nonprofit project aimed at clearing out the ever-growing accumulation of plastic trash that collects mid-ocean. How successful it will be remains to be seen, but the effort has captured the public\u2019s imagination.\n\nCLOSE It took 5 years, now the Ocean Cleanup system is heading to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. USA TODAY\n\nThe passive system involves a floating series of connected 4-foot booms that form a giant horseshoe at the surface of the ocean.Below that hangs a 9-foot skirt that corrals the tiny pieces of plastic trash that float in the water. The action of the currents and waves push trash into the system\u2019s center while the micro-plastic, as it's called, is captured by the hanging barrier.\n\n\u201cThat was just the first test, of course, the plastic we collected in the first five days for scientific purposes. We wanted to make sure the system was working correctly,\u201d said Francesco Ferrari, the nonprofit\u2019s environmental monitoring coordinator.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup system deployed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to sweep up plastic trash at the ocean's surface. (Photo: Ocean Cleanup)\n\nThe hope is that the device, the first of a planned fleet of 60 or more, can strain out the millions of pounds of plastic trash that collects in slow-moving ocean whirlpools called gyres, which can be hundreds of miles across. It will then be scooped up and taken by ship to land, where it will be recycled.\n\nFerrari spoke from Honolulu, where he\u2019d flown after spending the past seven weeks at sea as the system was towed out from San Francisco Bay, where it was built, first at a testing site 350 nautical miles offshore and then another 850 out to sea.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t aiming for a big extraction, it was just five days to test. And it worked,\u201d Ferrari said.\n\nThe group of 11 scientists and engineers has been testing the system since Sept. 8. That was the day, accompanied by a press boat, fans and the cheering family of Boyan Slat, the 24-year-old Dutchman and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup who came up with the ideaafter dropping out of college, that the system was towed unassembled out from under the Golden Gate Bridge to a spot off the California coast.\n\nThere, it was assembled and tested for seaworthiness for 2\u00bd weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time the entire system had been put together. There were a lot of theories about how it would work, but real life is always different,\u201d Ferrari said.\n\nThe trial went well, so the system was disassembled and towed to its final placement 1,200 nautical miles out, halfway between the West Coast and Hawaii to the middle of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It took almost two weeks to sail to the spot, where the staff once again put the device together and began testing it.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup, an ocean cleaning system, moves through the San Francisco Bay as it heads towards the Pacific Ocean for testing on Sept. 8. 2018.

USA TODAY\n\nThe first week of tests went well, though Ferrari was careful to say that it was too early to make any definitive conclusions about the overall goal of The Ocean Cleanup, which is to deploy 60 such systems by 2020. The group hopes it can clean up 50 percent of the garbage in the garbage patch in five years time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough time yet to make an estimate,\u201d Ferrari said.\n\nThe area of the Trash Patch is extremely remote, well off any shipping lanes. During their time there, the crew saw no other ships, though they were visited by a pod of six sperm whales, as well as some mahi-mahi and flying fish.\n\n\u201cWe had a hydrophone in the water, so we heard the whales approaching. They didn\u2019t really concern themselves with us, they were just passing by,\u201d Ferrari said.\n\nThe real testing begins now, as winter cyclones begin to form in the area. The observation crew will monitor the floating system as it\u2019s driven by waves and currents. The ship will stay well away from it while smaller inflatable boats go in to inspect.\n\nLocation of the Ocean Cleanup System 001 as of Oct. 28, 2018.

He and the staff will now begin on the next systems so that a fleet can eventually clean up the garbage humans have been pouring into the oceans for decades.\n\nResearchers and policymakers who study the problem of plastic pollution in the world\u2019s oceans have expressed concern both that the Cleanup project might not work as well as its creators hope and that it might also take attention away from the real issue \u2013 the ongoing avalanche of plastic pollution that is washed into the world\u2019s oceans every day. The hope is that The Ocean Cleanup will bring awareness and help make people think about the plastic they use and where it ends up.\n\n\u201cEveryone intuitively understands that if someone is brave enough to venture out and do that cleanup, then we have to do our part, too. Without turning off the tap of the plastic that washing into the ocean, we can\u2019t clean up,\u201d said Rolf Halden, a professor of environmental health engineering at Arizona State University who studies plastics in the environment.\n\n\"It\u2019s wonderful that people are concerned about the state of the open ocean; it\u2019s so far away and so few people will ever see it firsthand,\" said Miriam Goldstein, a marine biologist who is director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"It gives us hope for this very remote ecosystem.

They\u2019ve worked to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which could strip health care away from millions of people, including those with pre-existing conditions. They passed a tax bill that rewards the wealthy instead of lifting up hardworking families. They want to slash Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to pay for those tax cuts.

He has missed three games with a shoulder injury.\n\n\"I think he's very, very close,\" Brown said.\n\nGary's teammates have bristled at speculation he will not return to play in college and instead choose to focus on getting prepared for the NFL draft as former Ohio State defensive end Nick Bosa decided to do last month.\n\n\"He's trying to get in the game,\" said Kwity Paye, who has started in Gary's place. \"I feel for him on that.\"\n\nNOT SO SPECIAL\n\nPenn State has made numerous miscues lately on special teams. The Nittany Lions allowed two safeties on punts last week, giving up four points with a blocked kick and a poor snap. They also failed to recover an onside kick against Indiana and gave up a first down on a fake punt against Michigan State. First-year kicker Jake Pinegar has made all five of his field goal attempts over the last two games, but he has missed two of four field goals on the road.\n\nWANT TO FIGHT?\n\nBrown raved about Patterson's competitive spirit, recalling how fired up he was after Michigan lost a fumble at Michigan State.\n\n\"I kind of like guys like that,\" he said. \"They'll fight you in the alley.\"\n\nC-WEBB COMES BACK\n\nChris Webber is coming back to Michigan as an honorary captain, accepting an invitation extended by Harbaugh. More than five years ago, the reunion with the Fab Five star would not have been possible. The NCAA forced the university to dissociate itself from Webber from 2003-13 for his role in one of the biggest scandals in NCAA history. A federal investigation revealed now-deceased booster Ed Martin gave Webber and two other players more than $600,000 when they were student athletes.\n\nMichigan basketball coach John Beilein said there have been discussions about reuniting Webber with the basketball program while he's in town.\n\n\"I don't know how much Chris wants me to say, but we hope we can get together this weekend,\" Beilein said.\n\nWebber has not returned messages seeking comment this week from The Associated Press.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Larry Lage on Twitter at www.twitter.com/larrylage\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That means rewarding their hard work, not penalizing them in the name of diversity.\n\nYale University in New Haven, Connecticut, on Nov. 20, 2014. (Photo: Jessica Hill/AP)\n\nUniversities preach ethics. It is time they practice what they preach.\n\nIn most elite universities, Asian-Americans make up a far higher percentage of students than is reflected in the overall population. Yet that percentage could be higher. This point is illustrated by a recent investigation of Yale as well as a lawsuit targeting Harvard that is wrapping up this week. In both cases, discrimination is alleged against highly qualified Asian-American students as institutions seek to \u201cbalance\u201d their admissions.\n\nUnfortunately, this problem is only going to get worse because elite institutions are playing a zero-sum game.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the Asian-American population went up from 10.2 million in 2000 to 18.2 million in 2017, a 78 percent increase. Total college enrollment of Asian-Americans over roughly the same period rose just 33 percent, from 978,200 in 2000 to more than 1.3 million in 2016.\n\nIn the larger picture, applicants to Harvard College have nearly doubled during this time, but total admissions have remained steady. Likewise, at Stanford University, the number of those admitted has declined slightly even as the number of applicants has doubled since 2008. As the number of students from all races and ethnic groups continues to increase, the competition is expected to intensify at elite schools.\n\nDon't devalue Asian-American grades, scores\n\nDuring the internet boom years in the 1990s and early 2000s, America attracted nearly 200,000 highly qualified individuals, mostly from Asia, each year under H-1B and L1 visas. Many of them sought to stay in the United States, and now their children are applying to colleges.\n\nMeanwhile, international students increased from about 408,000 in 1990 to 1.1 million in 2016 \u2014 and of the 2016 crop, nearly two-thirdscame from Asia. They will continue to add to the Asian-American population in the USA.\n\nThese professionals came to this country primarily because of their education. There is an obsession, in general, for high grades among these immigrant families. Scoring one point less would put them thousands of spots below in the priority list for admissions to elite schools in their home countries. That obsession is transferred to their children raised here.\n\nMore: Harvard admissions lawsuit is a threat to America's diversity and strength\n\nWhy is Harvard discriminating against Asian Americans? 'Diversity' is no excuse for racial bias.\n\nYes, we deserve to be at Harvard: Trump's shameless affirmative action attack\n\nMany Asian-American parents take their children to relentless prep classes, music classes, sports, cultural programs and volunteer work on top of making them take advanced courses. There is tremendous pressure on these children; if a kid gets 99 out of 100 on math, the next question will be, \u201cWhy did you lose that one point?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t argue that elite schools don\u2019t matter to them. Parents and students know what it means to get degrees from places that have created scientists, Nobel laureates and great intellects. They know where the founders of Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and so many other companies went to school (even when they dropped out). If schools don\u2019t matter, Princeton wouldn\u2019t be showcasing the room where Einstein taught and Cal Tech wouldn\u2019t discuss Richard Feynman.\n\nToday, I see a systematic attempt to discredit high grade point averages and SAT/ACT scores from Asian-American students as somehow tainted and the result of a \u201cprivileged\u201d upbringing. The truth is their high scores are because they worked hard and not by virtue of legacy or political power. This bias has left many Asian-Americans upset despite their communities having championed and supported diversity in all walks of life.\n\nMake admissions process more transparent\n\nThese elite universities have broken the trust of hardworking Asian-American aspirants. The objective of achieving a diverse student body is essential and desirable \u2014 but the process is so opaque and insincere that it is giving rise to anger and frustration. In some cases, universities seem to be shifting metrics from objective to subjective measures in an attempt to justify rejecting applicants.\n\nThe University of Chicago says it doesn\u2019t care about ACT/SAT scores. Just send a two-minute video, as if videos will un-bias the system. Now, young scholars have to make sure their looks appeal to the admission folks. I recently heard someone wonder, watching a video of a prospective student, whether the applicant would appeal to recruiters. Code word \u2014 not good looking enough.\n\nCollege admissions is a complex and emotion-laden topic. Leading universities must increase enrollment numbers rather than taking pride in their low admission rates. They can support both diversity and academic excellence, and be transparent about their process. They should give additional points to those who come from difficult backgrounds, but should not discount hard work, talent and motivation as somehow tainted. Admissions processes collectively should not become a zero-sum game.\n\nPrabhudev Konana is a Distinguished Teaching Professor and the William H.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall,File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFans of No. 19 Iowa and Purdue are closely tracking the Big Ten West title chase.\n\nThey know the Hawkeyes and Boilermakers must rebound quickly from last week's road losses and the reward for Saturday's winner will be staying in contention for the conference championship game.\n\nThe coaches, meanwhile, spent this week downplaying the possibilities by focusing on this key, under-the-radar game while going silent on the long-term scenarios.\n\n\"Wasting time on that stuff, it's great for fans, it's great for the media, but it's not really productive for players and coaches to focus on because it's going to change anyway,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \"It really doesn't matter.\"\n\nIt could matter to Iowa (6-2, 3-2, No. 16 CFP). A win Saturday at Purdue sets up a crucial home game against division leader Northwestern next weekend and potentially puts the Hawkeyes back on track to make their second trip to Indianapolis.\n\nThe Boilermakers' road is more complicated because of their opening-night loss to Northwestern. But a victory over Iowa would give Purdue (4-4, 3-2) an outside shot with winnable road games at Minnesota and Indiana still on tap along with a home date against Wisconsin.\n\nSecond-year coach Jeff Brohm figures if the Boilermakers make the proper corrections, everything else eventually will fall into place.\n\n\"We are going to have to raise our level of play individually and as a unit,\" he said. \"We are going to have to do the small things right in order to win against good opponents and that's just football. I think when you get to the next level and it's good teams every week, the team that executes and plays the hardest is going to win.\"\n\nAnd both coaches are starting at quarterback.\n\nWhile the solid, steady play of Iowa's Nate Stanley and Purdue's David Blough kept their respective teams in the title talk, sub-par performances last week left their teams in this plight.\n\nStanley completed 36.7 percent of his passes and was picked off twice in a 30-24 loss at Penn State. Blough was intercepted three times and only got Purdue into the end zone once at Michigan State, a week after the Boilermakers hung 49 points on then-No. 2 Ohio State.\n\nWhoever plays better this week could put his team on the right track Saturday \u2014 and perhaps for the rest of the season.\n\n\"I think as long as we play the game the way it's supposed to, which we intend on doing, we'll live with the results,\" Brohm said. \"But I like the makeup of our team.\"\n\nLOOKING FOR MOORE\n\nEach week it seems Purdue receiver Rondale Moore makes a stronger case for being named the league's top newcomer. He leads the conference in receptions (68) and all-purpose yards (181.1 per game) and is second in yards receiving per game (100.3). And opponents have noticed.\n\n\"He's awfully impressive,\" Ferentz said. \"That (the Ohio State game) in itself was enough to impress anybody, not only playing the way he played but playing against that type of competition. It's pretty unusual for a guy that's a senior it would be really impressive. To consider him being just out of high school, it's awfully impressive.\"\n\nTHREE FOR THE ROAD\n\nIowa has pulled off a rare triple over the last month. After Tavon Young produced a career-high 96 yards rushing at Indiana, Ivory Kelly-Martin achieved the same feat with a 98-yard game against Maryland. Last week, Mekhi Sargent joined the club with a career-best 91 yards against the Nittany Lions. Could it happen again?\n\n\"I thought he looked his most comfortable out there. He blew a couple plays, but that's to be expected at this point of his career. But his attitude is great. He's really into it,\" Ferentz said, referring to Sargent. I don't know who's going to do what on Saturday, but all three of those guys, we're counting on all three of them to play well for us.\"\n\nLATE SEASON SURGE\n\nBrohm had a propensity for winning late season games before joining the Boilermakers last season, and that hasn't changed in West Lafayette. In 2017, the Boilermakers won three of their last four regular-season games to become bowl-eligible and then won the Foster Farms Bowl, giving Brohm a 3-1 mark during the final two months of the season. Brohm struggles to explain the secret to his success, but he's won three straight in November and December.\n\n\"I think that we try to improve as the year goes on,\" Brohm said. \"We try to work hard at our weaknesses try to improve the weak before and be critical of ourselves and find ways to fix mistakes.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The No. 12 Mountaineers and No. 15 Texas Longhorns play Saturday in a game both need to win to keep a share of the conference lead with an eye toward the conference title game in December. (AP Photo/Brad Tollefson, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 After years of being a late-season afterthought, Texas coach Tom Herman wanted the Longhorns to be competing for a Big 12 title in November.\n\nTexas is right where he wanted, with a key matchup against West Virginia up next.\n\nThe No. 12 Mountaineers (6-1, 4-1 Big 12, No. 13 CFP) and No. 15 Longhorns (6-1, 4-1, No. 17 CFP) play Saturday in a game both need to win to keep a share of the conference lead with an eye toward the conference title game in December.\n\nIt's been a long time since Texas played meaningful football after Halloween. For three seasons under Charlie Strong and Herman's first season in 2017, November was about trying to avoid losing seasons. This season, the Longhorns were rolling on a six-game win streak until losing last week at Oklahoma State to drop out of sole possession of first place in the Big 12.\n\n\"That game in Stillwater will only define our season if we let it,\" Herman said. \"We have an opportunity to define our season by how we respond to it, as well.\"\n\nHerman said almost exactly the same thing after Texas lost its opener to Maryland. The Longhorns responded with their longest win streak in five years.\n\nThe Mountaineers haven't won a league title since joining the Big 12 in 2012. West Virginia rallied after its only loss by whipping Baylor last week. Quarterback Will Grier, who broke his finger in the first quarter against Texas last year, lit up Baylor with three touchdown passes in a game the Mountaineers led 41-0 by halftime.\n\nThose are scary numbers for a Texas secondary that was shredded by Oklahoma State and gave up 31 points in the first half.\n\n\"Their energy level was high and they were striking like a firing squad,\" Texas senior defensive end Charles Omenihu said of the loss.\n\nThe road team has been a good bet in this series. West Virginia has won two of three meetings in Austin since 2012. Texas has said Saturday's game is sold out. The 2012 Longhorns-Mountaineers game drew a then-school record crowd of 101,851, which is still the third-largest in school history.\n\n\"A lot of guys in our locker room have been to Austin, been on that field,\" West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen said. \"I don't think we'll be surprised by any of the excitement that they have surrounding their program at this point.\"\n\nHolgorsen has never been one to be intimidated. A referee's open mic in 2016 caught Holgorsen mockingly telling game officials his players were tougher than Texas.\n\n\"Our guys are going to be excited about going to Austin,\" he said. \"I know we'll be ready to go.\"\n\nINTERCEPTIONS\n\nGrier has one of the biggest and best arms in college football but he's been sloppy at times. Despite its troubles last week against Oklahoma State, the Texas secondary has been solid and able to force turnovers. Freshman safeties Caden Sterns and B.J. Foster have five interceptions between them. Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger has 210 consecutive pass attempts without a turnover, a school record.\n\nGETTING TO GRIER\n\nOmenihu has six sacks and 9.5 total tackles for loss in the last four games. His job is to harass Grier or least force the quarterback to think about him on every play.\n\n\"He sits in the pocket. He's confident. I feel like we're going to get after him,\" Texas senior nose tackle Chris Nelson said of Grier.\n\nFIRST DRIVE\n\nWest Virginia has outscored opponents 83-27 in the first quarter, shutting out opponents four times in the opening period. Texas opponents have scored on their opening drives in six of eight games, reaching the end zone five times.\n\nTEXAS CHEMISTRY\n\nThe Longhorns started the game last week with several defensive starters or regulars sitting out because of rules violations and ended the game with senior defensive end Breckyn Hager drawing an personal foul penalty that was criticized by teammate. Texas players insist there's no problem in the locker room, but that could be tested early if West Virginia jumps out big.\n\n\"When you ground your kid, it doesn't mean you love them any less,\" said Herman, who didn't second-guess the suspensions. \"Our culture needs to be reinforced on a daily basis.\"\n\nEHLINGER ON THE RUN\n\nEhlinger's sprained throwing shoulder seemed fully recovered last week against Oklahoma State and he even ran 10 times for 47 yards and two touchdowns. Texas needs his legs. Ehlinger had at least one run on every scoring drive last week, and punted every time he didn't.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Kansas coach David Purdy was downright stunned that Brock Purdy was still available when he gave the promising quarterback from an Arizona high school a scholarship offer.\n\n\"It wasn't like he was quietly heralded. He was a guy that won a lot of awards,\" Beaty said. \"You turn on the tape and you saw a lot of ability in terms of spinning it. He can flat throw it, great release, compact. You could tell he commanded the offense. The other thing is he can move. In this day and age, there's so many freaks playing on the other side of the ball you'd better be able to move.\"\n\nAll of which presented Beaty with a pair of problems: The first is that Purdy decided not to play for the Jayhawks, and the second is that he ultimately chose Big 12 rival Iowa State.\n\nNow, the true freshman will be leading the Cyclones (4-3, 3-2) into Memorial Stadium on Saturday to face the Jayhawks (3-5, 1-4), who are coming off a rare conference win over TCU.\n\n\"When Brock came in, you could see a spark, production go up. You couple that with Matt Campbell and his staff, I mean, it spells trouble,\" Beaty said. \"They've done as good a job as I've seen.\"\n\nIndeed, the Cyclones' winning streak has hardly come against the dregs of the Big 12. They beat Oklahoma State on the road, thumped then-unbeaten West Virginia and won a close game with Texas Tech. Two of those teams were ranked when they played.\n\nThe challenge for Campbell's team is to keep the momentum from their second consecutive perfect October going into November. And the Cyclones' coach thinks it's entirely possible.\n\n\"You see a lot more capable bodies and capable young men that are helping and impacting our team than there was a year ago,\" he said. \"It's a credit to the multitude of guys who have stepped up.\"\n\nAs for Kansas, the challenge is to turn one conference win into two.\n\nThe Jayhawks relied on turnovers and a big game from freshman running back Pooka Williams to beat the Horned Frogs last week. But they haven't won more than one Big 12 game in a season since 2008, when Mark Mangino led them to an 8-5 record and their most recent bowl game.\n\n\"We still have a chance to go to a bowl game and we're not going to quit, and I love that about this football team,\" Jayhawks linebacker Keith Loneker Jr. said. \"I'm so happy to be a part of a group of guys that believe in that.\"\n\nSTOPPING POOKA\n\nWilliams averages 93 yards per carry, and his 175 all-purpose yards and two TDs against TCU helped the Jayhawks spring an upset win last week. \"He's just dynamic when he has the ball in his hands,\" Cyclones linebacker Willie Harvey said. \"You have to focus on him.\"\n\nSPEAKING OF STARS\n\nCyclones running back David Montgomery has four straight 100-yard rushing games, including 189 yards against the Mountaineers and 125 against the Red Raiders. He is at his best after first contact, too, and that's a big reason why he leads the Big 12 in yards rushing.\n\nTURNOVER TIME\n\nAfter ranking near the bottom nationally in turnovers last season, the Jayhawks are No. 1 this season. They're also second in turnover margin. \"That confidence in what they're doing allows them to be very aggressive and make plays on the ball,\" Campbell said.\n\nGETTING DEFENSIVE\n\nThe Cyclones' defense ranks in the top 10 nationally in yards per carry and yards rushing, and linebacker Marcel Spears Jr. is coming off a game in which he picked off two passes and returned one for a touchdown against the Red Raiders.\n\nPEYTON'S PLACE\n\nJayhawks quarterback Peyton Bender had the best game of his career against TCU, not only with his arm but with his grit. He lowered his head for a key first down late, and the Jayhawks rallied around the senior when the outcome was hanging in the balance. \"There's still some stuff we need to improve on,\" he said. \"We'll go back and look at the film, diagnose it and get ready to go.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Prescott uses the memory of his late mother to steady himself through the team's ups and downs. Prescott's sudden success gave him a platform to share the story of Peggy Prescott's death from colon cancer five years ago. The Cowboys missed the playoffs in Prescott's encore after a remarkable rookie season carried them to the postseason. Now that Dallas is struggling again, Prescott figures his football-loving mom would have an opinion, and words of encouragement.(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Through every interception, fumble and loss, Dak Prescott's mind is on the next throw, the next scramble, the next game for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe quarterback of America's Team thinks of where he's been: almost exactly five years removed from his mom, Peggy Prescott, dying of colon cancer when her son was a 20-year-old sophomore at Mississippi State. That makes it easier for him to move on in his football world.\n\n\"When you lose your mom, it's not that easy,\" Prescott said. \"That's something you've got to wake up every day, looking yourself in the face and knowing that you've got an angel. You've got an angel that has expectations for you to do and you've got to go out there and do them each and every day.\"\n\nAnd that's why the expectations of others won't faze Prescott with the losses almost as frequent as the victories since he led a franchise-record 11-game winning streak that helped him earn NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors in 2016.\n\nThe struggling Dallas offense, more specifically the passing game , appears to be the biggest obstacle for the Cowboys as they try to return to the playoffs after falling short during Prescott's less-than-stellar encore last year. He figures his football-loving mom would be right there with the rest of the critics, with a caveat.\n\n\"She'd let me know how she felt about our struggles and about the mistakes and those type of things,\" Prescott said. \"Simply on the other hand of having the confidence in me of fixing them and in our team of fixing them and getting back to playing the type of ball we want to play as a team.\"\n\nPrescott paused in the middle of the season during the Cowboys' open week for a cause that will endure for him regardless of which direction his career goes.\n\nHis role in Bristol-Myers Squibb's \"Ready. Raise. Rise.\" campaign is one of his cancer awareness initiatives from a platform Prescott's mom envisioned after she was diagnosed.\n\nWhether she could have seen it coming through her son's sudden stardom as quarterback of one of the world's most visible pro sports franchises is another question.\n\n\"I think she definitely did,\" said Prescott, who has been part of a campaign that led to a $250,000 donation to cancer advocacy groups. \"And she had plans and she had dreams for me.\"\n\nPrescott remembers watching with his mom when Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre played a night after his father died and threw for 399 yards and four touchdowns in Green Bay's 41-7 win over Oakland in 2003.\n\n\"She said, 'I want you to play if that ever happens,'\" Prescott said.\n\nHis mom died on a Sunday \u2014 the day after he threw three interceptions in a loss to South Carolina when he knew something was wrong because his mom hadn't texted or called him back before the game. The funeral was on a Wednesday \u2014 three days before a loss to Texas A&M.\n\n\"And I said, 'I've got to get back. My mom would be mad that I even missed that practice that I missed yesterday,'\" Prescott recalled. \"I could say that's the moment that I started allowing my mom to be my story, doing the things that she told me and she taught me.\"\n\nHis Mississippi State teammates saw it when Prescott led the Bulldogs to the first No. 1 ranking in school history a year later, before a loss to Nick Saban and Alabama.\n\nHis Dallas teammates saw it when he showed up as the forgotten fourth-round pick and third-stringer behind franchise passing leader Tony Romo. After backup Kellen Moore broke an ankle in training camp and Romo injured his back in a preseason game, Prescott got his chance. Romo never got his job back.\n\n\"He's had the same qualities from Day One, as a rookie to now,\" receiver Cole Beasley said. \"Hasn't changed at all. I don't know if he had many bad games in 2016. But I know he has always been the same guy whether good or bad since I've known him.\"\n\nThose qualities have been tested, with a 14-13 record since his remarkable 11-1 start and more interceptions, fumbles and sacks. While owner and general manager Jerry Jones keeps using stronger language to suggest he's settled on his quarterback of the future, doubters are numerous outside Cowboys headquarters.\n\n\"When you have a guy that's a winner, boy, hard to pass up on guys that are winners,\" said Florida coach Dan Mullen, who was Prescott's coach at Mississippi State. \"There's all kinds of different quarterbacks. A winner's a winner. That's the first thing I look for in quarterbacks.\"\n\nAsk Prescott how he thinks he needs to improve, and he'll say in everything. A Cowboys fan as a kid growing up near the Texas state line in Louisiana, Prescott longs to end a Super Bowl drought that's approaching 25 years.\n\nBut there's a small part of Prescott that would concede he's already a winner, looking back over five years since his mom died, and 25 months since he was the opening day quarterback with Dallas fans wondering if another season was lost because of another Romo injury.\n\n\"My mom's definitely an emotional woman,\" Prescott said, slipping into the present tense.\n\n\"So it'd be tears, it'd be a lot of tears in the last 25 months. She asked me when she initially got sick to allow her to be my story. She said all greats have a story. So for my mom to say that back in 2013 to where we are now, I think she'd be proud.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

North and South Korea agreed to officially inform the International Olympic Committee of their intent to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics. (Korea Pool/Yonhap via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North and South Korea on Friday agreed to officially inform the International Olympic Committee of their intent to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympics as they continued with reconciliation efforts.\n\nKorean sports officials after meeting at the North Korean border town of Kaesong also agreed to send a combined team to the world handball championships in January, according to a statement. The rivals vowed to \"actively participate\" in international sports events hosted by each other and organize more friendly competitions between them.\n\n\"The plan is to organize friendly competitions marking meaningful anniversaries between the South and North, for example the first anniversaries of the (April) inter-Korean summit and the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics,\" said South Korean Vice Sports Minister Roh Tae-kang, according to a pool report. North Korean officials at the meeting were led by a counterpart, Won Kil U.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in during a summit in September agreed to pursue a joint bid for the 2032 Olympics and send combined teams to the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games and other major sports events.\n\nIt would be extremely difficult to host the Olympics in North Korea under heavy U.S.-led sanctions, which are unlikely to be removed until the North takes concrete steps to relinquish its nuclear arsenal. There continues to be doubts whether Kim will ever give up his arsenal he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival. There's also declining public support among South Koreans for hosting mega sports events due to worries over huge costs.\n\nFor many South Koreans, it's mind-boggling that the Koreas are even talking about sharing the Olympics. North Korea boycotted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Summer Olympics, both held in Seoul, and relations dramatically worsened on the eve of the Seoul Olympics with the North's bombing of a South Korean passenger jet that killed all 115 aboard in December 1987.\n\nThe Koreas have often used sports to facilitate diplomacy. North Korea sent hundreds of people to the Winter Olympics in South Korea's Pyeongchang in February, including Kim's sister who conveyed his desire for an inter-Korean summit after tensions created by North Korean nuclear and missile tests.\n\nSouth Korea's enthusiasm for engagement with its rival has created unease in Washington, which has called for allies to maintain pressure until Pyongyang denuclearizes.\n\nSouth Korea last month walked back on a proposal to lift some of its unilateral sanctions against North Korea following President Donald Trump's blunt retort that Seoul could \"do nothing\" without Washington's approval.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Austin Anthony/Daily News via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe unusual aspect of this year's freshman class is that three of the very top guys signed with the same team and play similar positions.\n\nDuke forwards RJ Barrett, Cam Reddish and Zion Williamson were rated among the nation's top five prospects in their class according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports .\n\n\"All three can play together, but they're kind of all the same position \u2014 they're primarily small forwards,\" said Jerry Meyer, the director of scouting for 247Sports. \"That's one reason people were surprised Zion ended up at Duke. The narrative being built around why he wouldn't go to Duke is they already had two elite small forwards.\"\n\nThe early returns suggest they'll make it work just fine. The trio is part of a loaded Duke freshman class that also includes guard Tre Jones, ranked 15th in the 247Sports Composite.\n\nWilliamson, Barrett and Reddish averaged a combined 70 points, 16 rebounds and 11.5 assists in the fourth-ranked Blue Devils' two preseason exhibition victories. Meyer is interested in seeing if Duke experiments with any lineups featuring four freshmen in which the 6-foot-7 Williamson defends the opposing team's center.\n\n\"It would be kind of like the Golden State Warriors thing where you go small and play without a center sometimes, very similar to what Golden State does with Draymond Green,\" Meyer said.\n\nHere's a rundown of some freshmen who should make a major impact this season. For the purposes of this list, we decided to limit ourselves to just one of the Duke newcomers.\n\nRJ BARRETT, DUKE\n\nPosition: Forward. Height: 6-7.\n\nBarrett was the lone freshman included in the Associated Press preseason All-America team . He's the nation's No. 1 overall prospect in his class according to the 247Sports Composite. He also was the Gatorade national high school player of the year. Barrett was born in Toronto and helped Canada win a gold medal at the FIBA U19 Men's Basketball World Cup this year, but he played high school basketball at Montverde (Florida) Academy. Barrett has averaged 27.5 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists in two exhibition games.\n\n\"He has a great feel for the game,\" Meyer said. \"He can finish a play, can start a play, can make the assist pass, can make the hockey assist pass, get you rebounds. The key for him is outside shooting, and evidently that's improving.\"\n\nCHARLES BASSEY, WESTERN KENTUCKY\n\nPosition: Center. Height: 6-11.\n\nBassey was the No. 7 prospect in the 247Sports Composite and the only college-bound player in the top 18 who chose a non-Power Five school. He averaged 19.4 points, 12.8 rebounds, 3.4 blocks, 2.9 assists and 1.7 steals last season at Aspire Academy in Louisville, Kentucky. Bassey had 12 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks in a preseason exhibition victory over Campbellsville.\n\n\"He can be a dominant inside scorer and rebounder at any level,\" Meyer said.\n\nBOL BOL, OREGON\n\nPosition: Center. Height: 7-2.\n\nBol, the son of former NBA center Manute Bol, was ranked fourth in the 247Sports Composite. He's from Olathe, Kansas, but played high school basketball at Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nevada. Bol averaged 20.4 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.4 blocks his senior year at Findlay Prep.\n\n\"He can score from all three levels, and for someone that size, he really represents a lot of problems. He's got a soft touch. We've got to move him around a little bit because physically he's not real strong. You just can't put him in the block and let him bang around,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"But he does move in there very well. He catches the ball well. I've been really pleased with his instincts and his ability to pass the ball.\"\n\nDARIUS GARLAND, VANDERBILT\n\nPosition: Guard. Height: 6-2.\n\nGarland and teammate Simi Shittu are the first two McDonald's All-Americans ever to sign with Vanderbilt. Shittu was ranked 11th and Garland 14th in the 247Sports Composite, but Garland could make the bigger impact as a point guard who should have the ball in his hands often. Garland helped Brentwood (Tennessee) Academy win four straight state titles. He averaged 27.6 points his senior year.\n\n\"He's quick, can handle the ball. He can do everything you want a guard to do. He can get to the rim. He can be a distributor. He's an outstanding shooter, has a pull-up game. He can defend,\" Meyer said. \"I think the question for him as a college freshman will be strength and physicality.\"\n\nROMEO LANGFORD, INDIANA\n\nPosition: Guard. Height: 6-6\n\nLangford was ranked seventh in the 247Sports Composite and was one of three finalists for the Gatorade national high school player of the year award. He scored 3,002 career points at New Albany High School to rank fourth in Indiana boys basketball history. Langford followed that up by scoring 19 points in the McDonald's All-American Game.\n\n\"He's a very polished player with the ball in his hands, can score any way you want,\" Meyer said. \"He has the physical tools to do everything as a shooting guard.\"\n\nNASSIR LITTLE, NORTH CAROLINA\n\nPosition: Forward. Height: 6-6.\n\nRanked third in the 247Sports Composite, Little helped Orlando (Florida) Christian win state titles each of his last two years in high school. He also was salutatorian of his senior class. Little was most valuable player of the McDonald's All-American Game and the co-MVP of the Jordan Brand Classic. He scored 28 points in the McDonald's game and 24 in the Jordan Brand Classic.\n\n\"He's the full package for a combo forward,\" Meyer said. \"He's a physical athlete, powerful and dominant inside around the basket but also can shoot the 3 and can stretch the defense some. He has a complete skill set.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 It's been a year since Air Force lost its grasp on the Commander in Chief's Trophy, and the Falcons want it back.\n\n\"The CIC always means a lot, but especially this year after what happened last year,\" Falcons senior offensive guard Griffin Landrum said. \"That would be huge for this football team to get that trophy back.\"\n\nAir Force has won the coveted hardware, which goes to the champion of the annual series among the three service academies, a record 20 times. Army finally broke through for the seventh time last year, first stunning Air Force 21-0 at Falcon Stadium, an embarrassing home loss that snapped a school-record, 306-game scoring streak dating to 1992. The Black Knights then beat Navy by one point to win the trophy for the first time since 1996.\n\nToday, the hardware rests inside the Kimsey Athletic Center at West Point alongside statues of four of the academy's most renowned football figures: Hall of Fame coach Earl \"Red\" Blaik and his three Heisman Trophy winners \u2014 Glenn Davis, Felix \"Doc\" Blanchard and Pete Dawkins.\n\nAir Force (3-5) visits on Saturday, and the Black Knights (6-2) are intent on keeping the trophy right where it is.\n\n\"We're excited,\" Army quarterback Kelvin Hopkins Jr. said. \"Last year's game was a great game and a great effort by us, but they're a really good team. However it plays out is how it plays out.\"\n\nThe Falcons sit on a precarious perch as the season winds down. They need to win three of their final four games to qualify for the postseason, and Michie Stadium has become a difficult place to play \u2014 Army has won 10 straight at home , the last a double-overtime victory over Miami of Ohio two weeks ago. At least the Falcons can take solace in knowing that not only were they the last visitor to win at Michie (31-12 two years ago), they've also won 18 of the past 21 games between the teams and are 14-10 on Army's home turf.\n\n\"This is a championship game for us,\" Air Force senior linebacker Brody Bagnall said. \"It kind of brings some life to the meeting rooms. We've been in some close games this year, but once we got to Navy week we were fired-up. Once you get to a service-academy week, it's a whole 'nother level.\"\n\nAtoning for last year is foremost on the mind. Led by quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw's 265 yards rushing, the Black Knights dominated without throwing one pass against the flummoxed Falcons.\n\n\"I don't think anybody really completely understood what they were doing in the scheme last year when we were playing these guys,\" Bagnall said. \"This year I actually know what I'm doing, and I think the defense feels the same way. We've just got to stop the run.\"\n\nThat's a tall task. Army's triple option ranks second nationally at 314.6 yards a game, averaging 4.6 yards a carry. Air Force, which throws the ball more, is averaging 255.5 and 4.26 on the ground and has outgained Army 1,100-731 passing, though both teams rank near the bottom of FBS in that category.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's just about how physical we come to play and how locked-in we are and how we execute our assignments,\" Army senior center Bryce Holland said. \"If we come out there and do that, we'll be pretty happy with the results.\"\n\nOther things to know when Air Force visits Army on Saturday:\n\nQUARTERBACK SHUFFLE\n\nAir Force has three quarterbacks on its depth chart \u2014 junior Isaiah Sanders, senior Arion Worthman, and sophomore Donald Hammond III. Hammond has played in five games with two starts but has missed the past two games with an injury. His first career start was against Navy, and he led Air Force to a 35-7 victory a month ago, rushing for three TDs and throwing for 142 yards and another score, so a victory over Army will again give the Falcons possession of the Commander in Chief's Trophy.\n\n\"It's the No. 1 priority,\" Air Force wide receiver Marcus Bennett said. \"It's bigger than us.\"\n\nNO TURNOVERS, PLEASE\n\nAir Force has lost seven fumbles and suffered two interceptions while Army hasn't lost a fumble since having two in the season-opener at Duke and has thrown three interceptions. In the last three years, the Black Knights are 12-0 under coach Jeff Monken when they don't lose the football.\n\n\"Coach preaches to us to take care of the ball, keep the offense on the field and the defense off as much as possible,\" Hopkins said.\n\nDEFENSE RULES\n\nSince both offenses use variations of the option, both defenses are all-too-familiar with the nuances of the ground-oriented attack. Army ranks eighth nationally in rushing defense (96.9 yards per game and 3.97 per carry) while Air Force sits at No. 16 (108.4 and 3.36).\n\nGO FOR IT\n\nArmy leads the nation in converting fourth-down plays, having failed only three times in 29 tries (89.7 percent). Air Force has converted 19 of 30 (63.3).\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham in Denver contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 The Breeders' Cup is back in familiar surroundings at Churchill Downs, with an additional stakes race bumping the two-day program to 14 and prize money up to a record $30 million.\n\nAs always, the marquee race is Saturday's $6 million Cup Classic that could help determine which thoroughbred ends up as Horse of the Year. Not to mention, establishing the top horse in several age divisions along with the top jockey and trainer.\n\nOne notable absence from the Classic is Triple Crown winner Justify, whom trainer Bob Baffert retired in July because of an ankle ailment. That leaves the Classic without horse racing's biggest name, but also a bunch of horses poised to make their presence known \u2014 and bettors happy.\n\nAccelerate aims to make it six wins in seven starts this year as the 5-2 favorite in the 1 1/4-mile headliner.\n\n\"He's had a really beautiful year,\" trainer John Sadler said this week. \"He's a really healthy, strong guy. As a 5-year-old, he's come out of those Classic races in good shape physically and continued right on.\"\n\nThe season-ending championships should also provide a glimpse of what to expect when racing returns to the historic track for next May's 145th Kentucky Derby.\n\nFriday's first day set aside for 2-year-olds could help establish the contenders. Things will begin with the inaugural Juvenile Turf Sprint, a $1 million event to be run over 5 1/2 furlongs. The feature is the $2 million Juvenile, where 5-2 favorite Complexity will race 1/16 mile in search of a 3-0 start.\n\nChurchill Downs is hosting the season-ending world championships for a record-tying ninth time and first since 2011. Santa Anita has also hosted nine times, most recently in 2016.\n\nSome other things to watch in the 35th Breeders' Cup World Championships:\n\nWELL RESTED\n\nBob Baffert's decision to not run Justify in the Classic is offset by two horses coming off six-month breaks. West Coast's runner-up finish to Accelerate in the Awesome Again Stakes was among three seconds this year. McKinzie's Pennsylvania Derby victory came after he was disqualified to second in the Grade 2 San Felipe in March. The 3-year-old also won the Grade 3 Sham at Santa Anita.\n\nSTAR-STUDDED DISTAFF\n\nThis race for fillies and mares features the two most recent Kentucky Oaks winners in Monomoy Girl and Abel Tasman. Trained by Louisville native Brad Cox, Monomoy Girl has won five of six as a 3-year-old and might have been unbeaten if not for a disqualification to second after winning the Grade 1 Cotillion in September. Second in last year's Distaff at Del Mar, Abel Tasman has eight wins and four seconds in 15 career starts and was last year's Eclipse Award winner as top 3-year-old filly.\n\nTOUGH ON TURF\n\nBritish filly Enable will make her American debut in the $4 million Breeders' Cup Turf as the even-money favorite behind Lanfranco Dettori. The 4-year-old has won both starts this year, including her second consecutive win in the Arc de Triomphe in France by a neck. She has nine wins and a third in 10 starts and more than $8.5 million in career earnings.\n\nSTRENGTH IN NUMBERS\n\nIrish-based trainer Aiden O'Brien has 15 entrants among eight races this weekend, including 2017 Juvenile Turf winner Mendelssohn, who's entered in the Classic. The Breeders' Cup Mile will have four O'Brien horses, while Friday's Juvenile Turf Sprint has three. The Juvenile Turf has 4-1 favorite Anthony Van Dyck, who will break from the No. 14 post.\n\nSCHEDULE CHANGE\n\nThe $1 million Cup Dirt Mile and $2 million Cup Distaff have moved from Friday to Saturday and expanded the card to nine races. The Distaff is now part of the final four races building up toward the Classic.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And they made us pay for it early,\" Lillard said. \"I think we showed our maturity and growth in how we rebounded and adjusted and made the changes we needed to make.\"\n\nJulius Randle scored 29 points, but Pelicans star Davis was sidelined by a right elbow sprain. Davis had returned from the injury Wednesday night against Golden State, when he collected 17 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in a 131-121 loss to the Warriors.\n\nDavis leads New Orleans with 25.2 points and 13 rebounds per game. He was replaced in the starting lineup against the Blazers by Jahlil Okafor.\n\nThe Blazers were home after a 3-1 trip that included victories at Orlando, Indiana and Houston.\n\nPortland was without Maurice Harkless because of a lingering left knee injury. Harkless has played in five of the Blazers' eight games this season.\n\nLillard had 10 points in the first quarter and the Blazers led 35-31. The Pelicans were paced by Randle, who had 23 points in the first half before he collected three fouls and went back to the bench.\n\nSeth Curry's 3-pointer gave the Blazers a 51-44 advantage. E'Twaun Moore's 3-pointer got the Pelicans within three late in the half, but the Blazers led 70-65 at the break.\n\nMoore's floater got the Pelicans as close as 65-64 in the third quarter but Portland held New Orleans off until Randle's jumper and Nikola Mirotic's free throw tied it at 90. Portland hit consecutive 3-pointers to end the threat.\n\nThe Blazers outscored the Pelicans 30-20 in the final quarter.\n\n\"The first three quarter of the game we gave ourselves a chance, then the fourth quarter we didn't score as well and we didn't get the stops when we needed them,\" Randle said.\n\nAl-Farouq Aminu had 17 points and 10 rebounds for Portland in his third double-double this season. The Blazers' reserves scored 50 points.\n\nMirotic finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds for New Orleans, and Jrue Holiday also had a double-double with 17 points and 10 assists.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPelicans: Davis warmed up with his teammates before the game. ... In his pregame talk with reporters, Alvin Gentry shot down reports of a confrontation the night before with DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis. \"It couldn't be further from the truth,\" Gentry said, characterizing the conversation as friendly.\n\nTrail Blazers: Terry Stotts was coaching his 500th game for the Blazers. ... Portland's franchise high for 3-pointers is 21. ... Portland's point total was a season high. ... The Blazers scored 30-plus points in every quarter.\n\nABOUT THOSE THREES: The Pelicans had eight 3-pointers compared to Portland's 18.\n\n\"We've gotta get guys off the line, you know? The point differential is 30 points from the 3-point line,\" Gentry said. \"I mean, we dominate in the paint, we shoot more free throws, but it's really, really difficult to make up a 30-point deficit from three. So we've got to get them off the line and make a few more of our own.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPelicans: Visit the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday.\n\nTrail Blazers: Host LeBron James and the Lakers on Saturday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The report casts doubt on the Indonesian low-cost carrier's claim to have resolved the issues.\n\nThe Boeing 737 MAX 8 plunged into the Java Sea early Monday, minutes after taking off from the capital, Jakarta. One of the black boxes has been recovered, but is not fully intact. Lion Air said 65 body bags have been recovered and the process of identifying the dead is ongoing.\n\nHundreds of rescue workers continued to search for victims and the plane\u2019s fuselage Friday. The plane engine turbine - one of the largest pieces of debris so far recovered - was lifted out of the sea Friday, CNN reported.\n\nDivers retrieved one of the black boxes - the flight data recorder - on Thursday but the cockpit voice recorder has yet to be located.

(AP) \u2014 There are easier ways to start a West Coast road trip than against the perennial Pacific Division power San Jose Sharks in their notoriously loud arena.\n\nThat assignment was just fine with Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno.\n\n\"A team that comes out so hard at you, so you have to be in that mindset,\" he said.\n\nThe Blue Jackets' mindset was right on point Thursday night.\n\nFoligno scored twice, Anthony Duclair had a goal and an assist and Columbus skated to a 4-1 victory over San Jose.\n\n\"No matter what people say on the outside, we know better,\" Foligno said. \"Our identity is a hard-working, tenacious team, and then our skill takes over from there.\"\n\nSergei Bobrovsky made 44 saves as the Blue Jackets won for the third time in four games. Seth Jones also scored.\n\n\"I felt like a part of the team and I did my thing,\" Bobrovsky said. \"I didn't try to create too much and I didn't need that. So I just focused on my things, played my game and just enjoyed, had fun.\"\n\nIt was San Jose's first regulation loss since Oct. 14 at New Jersey. The Sharks were 4-0-2 in their last six games since dropping three of four during a road trip.\n\n\"We weren't good enough to win the game,\" coach Peter DeBoer said. \"We were doing enough to hope to win. We have to do better.\"\n\nThe Sharks jumped in front on a power-play goal 11:50 into the first period. Logan Couture and Marc-Edouard Vlasic assisted on Kevin Labanc's second goal of the season.\n\nBut that was it for San Jose against Bobrovsky, and Columbus tied it on Duclair's fifth goal at 16:30 of the first. Ryan Murray and Alexander Wennberg had assists on the play.\n\nThe Blue Jackets went ahead to stay when Jones scored on a give-and-go with Duclair 9:15 into the second. Lukas Sedlak also had an assist on Jones' second goal of the season.\n\nFoligno added a breakaway goal with 1:20 left in the period. Foligno slipped a backhand inside the left post past Aaron Dell.\n\nFoligno also had an empty-netter with 1:01 remaining.\n\n\"We probably played our best game away from the puck,\" Blue Jackets coach John Tortorella said.\n\n\"We've done a lot of talking in meetings the last couple of days about, we're not going to be a safe team, we don't want to be a safe team, but that doesn't mean you can't play above the puck when we don't have it. A lot of our offense comes from being above the puck and in transition we stop teams before they get to our blue line, because we have back pressure.\"\n\nDell made 23 saves.\n\n\"It's simple. We didn't play well,\" Couture said. \"We didn't pass well, we didn't spend enough time in their end, we didn't forecheck, we turned the puck over. Columbus played harder than us. They boxed out around the net. We didn't do a good job of creating traffic around the net and when we did, that's when we created chances.

Brian Elliott made 25 saves, and Claude Giroux and Wayne Simmonds each had a goal.\n\n\"We've played pretty good hockey at different times,\" coach Dave Hakstol said. \"We just haven't been consistent enough from one game to the next. And there's been games we haven't been consistent enough period to period. That's what we've been able to do the last two nights is put consistent play together for 60 minutes.\"\n\nIlya Kovalchuk had a goal and an assist, and Jeff Carter scored a power-play goal for the Kings, who have lost seven of eight.

It's a tight game, you've got to keep playing. The next line, that's two games in a row where we do a great job getting a big lead back.\"\n\nWhile the Flyers have been better able to respond positively to those circumstances, Carter viewed allowing the goal so quickly as a reflection of the Kings' largely stagnant play.\n\n\"It's just kind of the way things are going right now for us,\" he said. \"We need to stick together and use that positive momentum to our advantage. We're getting it and we're giving it right back. It's tough right now.\"\n\nProvorov put the Flyers ahead 1-0 at 17:35 of the first period, scoring in the slot on a one-timer from Dale Weise.\n\nJordan Weal pressured defenseman Derek Forbort into losing the puck in the neutral zone, the kind of breakdowns Kings coach John Stevens said have been occurring too frequently.\n\n\"A step slow with the puck, and a step slow checking to get the puck back, and too much time in your zone,\" Stevens said. \"Too many bad things happening.\"\n\nNOTES: Flyers G Michal Neuvirth did not dress for what the team described as precautionary reasons.

Fortunately for them, it hasn't cost them the last two times.\n\nNew York gave up a late goal for the third straight game \u2014 this time to Rickard Rakell with 25.3 seconds remaining \u2014 but was able to beat the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 in a shootout Thursday night.\n\nIt was the second shootout victory in three days for the Rangers.\n\nTheir struggles in the last minute began Sunday at Los Angeles when they were unable to clear the puck and Alec Martinez scored with 55 seconds left to hand New York a 4-3 loss. Two nights later in San Jose, the Sharks' Tomas Hertl tied the game at 3 with less than two seconds remaining, but the Rangers were able to win in a shootout.\n\n\"It's a little demoralizing to be giving up goals in the final minute of games, but we keep making progress,\" rookie coach David Quinn said. \"Over a season you have to find ways to manage to get points when you are not playing great or feeling great. We did that tonight.\"\n\nMats Zuccarello and Mika Zibanejad scored in the shootout for the Rangers, who went 2-2 on a four-game road swing. Alexandar Georgiev made 22 saves and turned away both Ducks attempts in the tiebreaker.\n\nBrett Howden and Kevin Hayes scored in regulation for the Rangers, who improved to 3-0 in shootouts.\n\n\"Those are huge points.

Ryan Kesler blocked Howden's shot but Hayes was able to corral the deflection and fire it past Gibson for his third of the season.\n\nAnaheim tied it with its second power-play goal in its last six chances when Silfverberg scored on the rebound of a shot by Rakell that went off Georgiev's blocker. It was Silfverberg's fourth of the season, which tied him with Pontus Aberg for the team lead.\n\nLess than two minutes later, Howden was wide open in front and scored his third goal off a pass from Jimmy Vesey.

(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCALGARY, Alberta (AP) \u2014 Down by three goals going into the third period, the Calgary Flames were far from done.\n\nMark Giordano had a goal and two assists, and Calgary scored five straight times in the third to rally past the Colorado Avalanche 6-5 on Thursday night.\n\nWith the game tied 4-all, Giordano scored the go-ahead goal at 13:47 when he jumped up into the rush, took a pass from Mikael Backlund and snapped a shot over the blocker of goaltender Semyon Varlamov.\n\n\"If you're coming in late and their forwards are scrambling back, sometimes things open up,\" said Giordano, who has two goals and 12 assists this season. \"I was happy (Backlund) found me there, it was a good spot to shoot from.\"\n\nBacklund, Elias Lindholm, Sean Monahan, James Neal and Michael Frolik also scored for the Flames (8-5-1), who have won three straight. Matthew Tkachuk added three assists.\n\nIt's already the fourth time this season the Flames have come back to win when trailing after two periods.\n\nColin Wilson, Vladislav Kamenev, Sheldon Dries, Carl Soderberg and Gabriel Landeskog scored for Colorado (7-4-2), which has lost three of four.\n\nIt was the first career goal for both Kamenev and Dries.\n\n\"Five goals in the third is a lot. Give credit to them, but we definitely had a hand in letting them come back,\" said Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon, who was held off the scoresheet and ended up minus-3.\n\nTrailing 4-1 after two periods, Calgary began its comeback 47 seconds into the third on Lindholm's power-play goal, his team-leading ninth goal of the season.\n\nThe man advantage was the result of a charging major on Ian Cole late in the second period after his heavy hit crumpled Mark Jankowski as he was looking back for a pass. Shaken up, Jankowski went to the dressing room.\n\nHe returned to sit on the bench in the third, but did not play. After the game, he was deemed healthy.\n\nIt was the response to the hit from Sam Bennett, who immediately fought Cole, that players pointed to as the turning point.\n\n\"He's a feisty little kid. He definitely knows how to throw them,\" Backlund said. \"That gave the team some momentum and some energy. Great job by him stepping up for the team and for Janko. It brought a lot of energy into the room going into the third.\"\n\nThe Flames drew within one at 5:21 when Monahan deflected Noah Hanifin's point shot.\n\nThe Saddledome crowd then roared at 10:52 when Neal got the puck in the slot and ripped a shot past Varlamov for his third goal and a tie game.\n\n\"It felt good, obviously, for me,\" said Neal, who had been off to a slow start with just two goals in his first 13 games. \"Personally, I want to score goals, you want to help the team win. It's been a little bit of tough sledding here at the start, but I've been through it before. You just try to stick with it and you get rewarded like I did tonight.\"\n\nThe sequence leading up to Neal's goal began when rookie defenseman Juuso Valimaki caught Matt Calvert with a body check at the blue line, turning the puck over.\n\n\"He timed it perfect and to be able to keep the puck in the zone, all in one shot. That was a real turning point, too,\" Giordano said. \"Really put them back on their heels and then we kept going.\"\n\nJust more than a minute after Giordano's go-ahead goal, Frolik made it a two-goal lead, one-timing Tkachuk's feed for his sixth goal.\n\nThe Avalanche got a power-play goal from Landeskog at 18:57 to set up a harrowing finish.\n\nLandeskog's goal first appeared to be Wilson's second of the game before the Colorado captain was credited with his 11th of the season. Wilson picked up an assist on the play.\n\nMike Smith got the win despite giving up five goals on 26 shots. He improved to 5-4-1.\n\nVarlamov, who entered with a 1.62 goals-against average and .950 save percentage, made 31 saves. The five goals he allowed in the third period came on just 11 shots.\n\n\"Lack of detail and lack of commitment,\" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. \"We resorted back to bad habits like circling away from the puck.\"\n\nCalgary was controlling the game, outshooting the Avs 17-4, when a stray pass from Giordano resulted in Kamenev breaking up the ice on a short-handed 2-on-1 and scoring his first career goal.\n\nLess than two minutes later, Dries got his first NHL goal when his rebound banked off the skate of Rasmus Andersson in the slot and went into the net.\n\nNOTES: Monahan extended his point streak to five games (two goals, six assists). ...

(AP) \u2014 No. 9 UCF only knows one way to answer questions about where it stands among the elite teams in college football \u2014 keep winning.\n\nThe defending American Athletic Conference champions remained unbeaten Thursday night, pulling away from Temple late for a 52-40 victory that extended the nation's longest winning streak and gave the Knights (8-0, 5-0) sole possession of first place in the AAC East Division.\n\nAlabama, Clemson and Notre Dame are only other undefeated teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision. They're among the front-runners in the race for spots in the four-team College Football Playoff, while UCF remains a longshot despite a sparkling record dating to last season.\n\n\"I'm not even concerned about that right now,\" coach Josh Heupel said. \"Our job is to go 1-0 every week. ... If you do that, you probably deserve to go play for something special at the end of the year.\"\n\nMcKenzie Milton threw for 312 yards and three touchdowns, Greg McCrae rushed for 188 yards and one TD, and the Knights defense forced two turnovers and held Temple to six points after halftime.\n\nAnthony Russo completed 31 of 52 passes for 444 yards and four touchdowns for Temple (5-4, 4-1), which had a three-game winning streak snapped despite gaining 670 yards on a night the teams combined to gain exactly 1,300.\n\nTaj McGowan scored on runs of 1 and 10 yards for UCF, the latter finishing a long drive that put the Knights up 49-40 after Temple (5-4, 4-1) nearly rallied to tie it.\n\nMilton, returning to the lineup after missing a game with an undisclosed injury, finished 17 of 33 with one interception. Dredrick Snelson scored on a 19-yard reception and Michael Colubiale had TD catches of 9 and 19 yards.\n\nVentell Bryant had seven receptions for 107 yards and two TDs for the Owls. Russo completed passes to 11 different receivers, including Branden Mack and Randle Jones, who scored while building a 34-28 halftime that lasted less than a minute into the third quarter.\n\nUCF took a 42-34 lead into the fourth quarter and stopped a potential tying two-point conversion before pulling away for good.\n\n\"Down at halftime, the kids were calm and came out and kept playing,\" Heupel said. \"I told them at halftime champions love playing in environments like this, in situations like this.\"\n\nCFP RANKING\n\nIn addition to staying on top of the East Division standings, UCF remained on course to be part of the discussion about which teams deserve to be part of this year's CFP.\n\nThe Knights, denied a spot in the playoff field a year ago despite finishing as the only undefeated team in the FBS, were 12th in the initial CFP rankings released this week.\n\nLOTS OF OFFENSE\n\nIn the first half alone, the teams combined for 808 yards \u2014 510 passing and 298 rushing \u2014 with Russo throwing for 277 and three TDs and Milton countering with 233 yards and two TDs. Both quarterbacks had a rushing TD in the second quarter, Russo scoring on a 5-yard run on a fake field goal play.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTemple: The Owls are 5-2 since Russo took over at quarterback following losses to Villanova and Buffalo to begin the season. Armstead returned from missing two games with an ankle injury, immediately making his presence felt with a 33-yard burst on the first play from scrimmage. The senior running back finished with 142 yards on 27 carries.\n\nUCF: Milton had another big night, however the Knights kept the nation's longest winning streak alive by running for 318 yards and doing a good job defensively of keeping Temple out of the end zone in the second half.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nOne of the knocks on UCF's success is the Knights' strength of schedule. Temple is the only team the defending AAC champions have beaten this season that currently has a winning record. With the Owls entering Thursday night as double-digit underdogs, the Knights will need outside help to move upward.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTemple: at Houston, Nov. 10\n\nUCF: Remain home vs. Navy, Nov. 10\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Rams expect to have Kupp back in uniform after a two-game absence with a knee injury. The second-year target\u2019s presence would be a boon for quarterback Jared Goff, who found Kupp for a team-leading 869 yards receiving last season. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Cooper Kupp returned to practice with the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday, less than three weeks after the receiver injured his knee.\n\nWhile Kupp is still uncertain whether he'll play Sunday, the second-year pro is grateful to be anywhere near the field this quickly, since he also incurred a concussion one week before he was carted off the turf in Denver with that knee injury.\n\n\"It could have been worse,\" Kupp said. \"Guys in this league go through a lot worse. It's football. You know these things are going to happen. At some point, everyone goes through some kind of injury if you play this game long enough. Hopefully you'll just move through this thing and work through it and get back out there playing the game I love.\"\n\nKupp hopes to be in uniform when the Rams (8-0) visit the New Orleans Saints (6-1) in a tantalizing midseason NFC showdown, and coach Sean McVay expected to have LA's full complement of receivers at Jared Goff's disposal in what could be a high-scoring showdown with Drew Brees and coach Sean Payton.\n\nKupp was hurt by a horse-collar tackle from the Broncos' Darian Stewart. One week earlier, he left a game in Seattle after taking a head hit.\n\nThe dual experiences were a challenge for a receiver who never missed significant playing time in college at Eastern Washington or during his outstanding rookie season, when he led Los Angeles with 869 yards receiving and formed a tight bond with Goff.\n\n\"The first thing that goes through my head as soon as it happens is, 'I'm letting these guys down by not being able to be out there and compete,'\" Kupp said. \"You put so much time and effort into getting your body ready to play, and then when you're not able to because your body is not allowing you to, you feel like, 'What else could I have done to prevent this from happening?'\"\n\nA receiver can't do much about a horse-collar tackle from behind, and the injury was alarming to his teammates.\n\n\"I think the knee one was definitely scary to see,\" Goff said. \"You see those happen all the time, and usually they're not very good. Whenever someone gets carted off like that, usually it doesn't end up very good. I think he's recovered really quickly.\"\n\nKupp had 30 catches for 438 yards and five touchdowns in the Rams' first five games this season. During his absence from most of the past three games, Los Angeles relied on second-year pro Josh Reynolds to fill Kupp's usual spot in the Rams' wideout trio of Robert Woods, Brandin Cooks and Kupp.\n\nReynolds had only seven catches in the last four games, but two went for touchdowns in last week's 29-27 win over Green Bay. McVay loves to use his top three receivers in multiple roles with minimal substitutions, so Reynolds' ability to fill in for Kupp was vital.\n\n\"It's a great group of three,\" McVay said. \"But I think what's been great, if you're going to try to spin a positive on Cooper being out, is it's given us a chance to see what we believed in Josh Reynolds, and that he's a starting-caliber receiver, certainly isn't too big for him.\"\n\nThe Rams' passing balance has been a major asset in their unbeaten start. Woods (672 yards receiving) and Cooks (643 yards receiving) are both on pace for 1,000-yard seasons, while running back Todd Gurley is a major factor in the passing game again with 30 catches for 351 yards.\n\n\"Those three are very good receivers that can do everything,\" McVay said of Woods, Cooks and Kupp. \"I think their skill sets complement each other really well.\"\n\nNOTES: CB Sam Shields missed practice Thursday with an illness. ... LB Trevon Young returned to full participation in practice. ... Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips jokingly referred to this weekend's trip to New Orleans as \"another revenge game for me.\" Phillips was the Saints' 38-year-old interim coach for four games in 1985, the first of his six stints as an NFL head coach. \"Then they shipped me out of there, so I'm still mad at them,\" Phillips said laughingly. ... Dante Fowler said his first full practice with the Rams went well, and he is optimistic about being able to contribute Sunday if the Rams put him on the field. Los Angeles acquired the pass-rusher from Jacksonville in a trade Tuesday. \"That's probably one of the easiest positions to come in and play,\" Phillips said. \"You say, 'Hey, you go rush the passer on this down.' But he's picked up everything well. Seems like a sharp guy. Picked up everything so far. We may use him in our first- and second-down defense, too.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Raheem Mostert added a 52-yard TD run and the defense generated eight sacks for the first time since 2009.\n\nBut the story of the game was Mullens, who got rid of the ball quickly and took advantages of several breakdowns in coverage for big plays, including the 24-yard TD pass to a wide-open Garcon on the opening drive.\n\n\u201cIt was cool that he didn\u2019t change under the big lights and these circumstances,\u201d cornerback Richard Sherman said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really surprised.

But the matchup between these two quarterbacks features lots of wins, even more touchdown tosses \u2014 and plenty of mutual admiration.\n\n\"I love watching him play,\" Brady said of Rodgers. \"To see him up close is great. I watch him play whenever he's out there. I study a lot of the Packers' offense, I study Aaron as a player and he just does an incredible job.\"\n\nThe two will meet for just the second time when the Packers (3-3-1) and Patriots (6-2) square off Sunday night.\n\nRodgers and the Packers won the only other showdown, 26-21 at Green Bay in 2014.\n\n\"I loved going to Lambeau Field and playing him four years ago,\" Brady said. \"It'll be great to play him at home this time. I'm really looking forward to it.\"\n\nThe weekend began Thursday night with the San Francisco 49ers' 34-3 victory over the Oakland Raiders in a lopsided Battle of the Bay. Nick Mullens threw for 262 yards and three touchdowns for the most productive NFL debut since the merger for the 49ers (2-7). The Raiders are 1-7.\n\nOff are: Indianapolis (3-5), Arizona (2-6), New York Giants (1-7), Jacksonville (3-5), Philadelphia (4-4), Cincinnati (5-3).\n\nFootball fans will have to wait until Sunday night for the Packers and Patriots to kick off, but they could be treated to plenty of passing.\n\nRodgers (24 of 38 for 368 yards, two touchdowns) and Brady (22 of 35 for 245 yards, two TDs) combined for 613 yards passing the last time they faced each other. Rodgers (103.6) and Brady (97.6) also rank first and third, respectively, in NFL history in career passer rating.\n\n\"I enjoy competing against great players,\" Rodgers said, \"and obviously Tom is right at the top.\"\n\nLOS ANGELES RAMS (8-0) at NEW ORLEANS (6-1)\n\nThe Rams put their undefeated mark \u2014 the only team in the NFL yet to lose \u2014 on the line in a game that features the squads with the NFC's best records.\n\nLos Angeles boasts the No. 2 overall offense with the top-ranked running game in the league, led by the versatile and electric Todd Gurley. But the Saints have the No. 1 run defense in the NFL, so something's got to give, right?\n\nOne thing the Rams have working in their favor: quarterback Jared Goff has won his past seven starts on the road with 13 touchdowns and five interceptions in that span.\n\nMeanwhile, Drew Brees has been sensational at home lately, with 1,045 yards passing with eight TDs and no INTs in his last three games at the Superdome.\n\nPITTSBURGH (4-2-1) at BALTIMORE (4-4)\n\nJoe Flacco and the Ravens won the first meeting this season, 26-14 on Sept. 30, and Baltimore will try to complete its first series sweep since 2015.\n\nThat game, by the way, was the last Ben Roethlisberger and the surging Steelers have lost.\n\nBig Ben & Co. are looking for their fourth straight victory, and that's despite all the drama \u2014 will he show up or not? \u2014 surrounding the still absent Le'Veon Bell. James Conner has done just fine in his place, though, rushing for 599 yards and nine touchdowns this season.\n\nIt might be tougher sledding this week, though, as the Steelers face a Ravens defense that ranks No. 1 overall in the NFL and is allowing a league-low 17.1 points and 293.8 yards per game.\n\nKANSAS CITY (7-1) at CLEVELAND (2-5-1)\n\nJust what the struggling Browns need: a matchup against the team that has the best record in the AFC as well as the NFL's most potent offense.\n\nThe Chiefs average a league-high 36.3 points per game and Patrick Mahomes has been putting up eye-popping numbers. He has a league-leading 26 TD passes, just four shy of the franchise record set by Len Dawson in 1964, and has thrown for 300 yards or more in a Chiefs-record seven straight games. Mahomes also leads the NFL in yards passing (2,526) and TD-to-INT rate (plus-20).\n\nThe Browns are coming off another turbulent week following the firings of coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley. Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams will make his debut as the Browns' interim coach against Kansas City's Andy Reid, who is 6-0 in his career against Cleveland.\n\nLOS ANGELES CHARGERS (5-2) at SEATTLE (4-3)\n\nPhilip Rivers and the Chargers are well-rested after their bye-week break, looking to keep things going after a solid start to the season.\n\nRivers will start in his 200th straight game, becoming just the 10th player since the merger in 1970 with such a streak. And he has shown little signs of slowing. Rivers is tied for third in the NFL with 17 touchdown passes.\n\nHe'll face a Seahawks team that has won four of five and begins a stretch of six of nine games at home to close the regular season. Russell Wilson has 11 TD throws and no interceptions in his last five home games, and will look to build off last week's performance when he became the first player in franchise history to post a perfect quarterback rating.\n\nHOUSTON (5-3) at DENVER (3-5)\n\nHey, that guy looks familiar, huh?\n\nWide receiver Demaryius Thomas will face the team with which he spent his first eight-plus NFL seasons before being traded to the Texans on Tuesday. He'll be counted on by Houston right away to replace the injured Will Fuller and keep the DeShaun Watson-led offense humming.\n\nHouston is the fifth team since the 1970 merger to win five consecutive games following an 0-3 start.\n\nTAMPA BAY (3-4) at CAROLINA (5-2)\n\nFitzmagic is back. Again.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick will start at quarterback for the Buccaneers \u2014 who rank No. 1 in the NFL in total offense \u2014 in place of the benched Jameis Winston. He'll look to recapture some of the success he had during his four-game stint as the starter at the beginning of the season. The 35-year-old Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards in each of the first three games, and had 11 touchdowns in that span with four interceptions before giving way to Winston.\n\nWhile the Buccaneers have instability at the quarterback spot, Cam Newton is firmly entrenched as the guy in Carolina and has the Panthers looking for their 10th straight home win with him under center. Newton has 17 combined touchdowns and just four interceptions this season.\n\nNEW YORK JETS (3-5) at MIAMI (4-4)\n\nSam Darnold faces the Dolphins for the second time, looking for a much better outing than the one he had in Week 2 when New York lost 20-12. The rookie threw for 334 yards \u2014 still a personal best \u2014 but also had two interceptions.\n\nThis also begins a three-game stretch in which New York takes on AFC East opponents.\n\nThe Jets will see a different face running the offense on the other side, with Brock Osweiler getting the start for the Dolphins in place of the injured Ryan Tannehill. Osweiler has played well with six touchdown throws and three interceptions in his three starts, during which Miami is 1-2.\n\nATLANTA (3-4) at WASHINGTON (5-2)\n\nThe ageless Adrian Peterson and the Redskins will try to go two games up on Philadelphia in the NFC East. They'll have to get past the Falcons first, though, and Atlanta has won each of the last five meetings.\n\nPeterson, by the way, rushed for 149 yards and a TD last week against the Giants. He has some past success when facing Atlanta, with 442 yards from scrimmage and three TDs in three games against the Falcons.\n\nDespite the Falcons' mediocre record, Matt Ryan is off to a solid start and leads the NFL with 333.6 yards passing a game. Julio Jones, his favorite target, needs 134 yards receiving in his 102nd game to become the fastest to 10,000 in a career.\n\nDETROIT (3-4) at MINNESOTA (4-3-1)\n\nAdam Thielen comes into this one with his sights set on the end zone \u2014 as usual.\n\nThe Vikings wide receiver is tied with former Lions star Calvin Johnson (2012) with eight straight games of 100 or more yards receiving, the longest streak in NFL history.\n\nTo get the record, he'll have to do it against Matt Patricia's fourth-ranked passing defense.\n\nSpeaking of Patricia, this is his first NFC North road test. The Lions have mostly fared well against division opponents overall, going 21-10 since the start of the 2013 season \u2014 the best of the NFC North teams.\n\nCHICAGO (4-3) at BUFFALO (2-6)\n\nThe Bears stopped a two-game skid last week by manhandling the Jets. Even more impressive was the way Mitchell Trubisky rebounded from a so-so first half in that game.\n\nThe second-year QB failed to throw for 300 or more yards after three straight while finishing with 222, but he had two touchdown passes and no interceptions. He has 13 TDs in his last four games, the most in that type of span for Chicago since Sid Luckman in 1947.\n\nThe Bills are turning back to turnover-prone Nathan Peterman, who's starting with rookie Josh Allen ruled out with a sprained elbow and Derek Anderson dealing with a concussion. Peterman, who lost his starting gig midway through the season opener, has thrown 10 interceptions in just 84 career attempts.\n\nTENNESSEE (3-4) at DALLAS (3-4)\n\nAmari Cooper makes his Cowboys debut after being acquired from Oakland on Tuesday, giving Dak Prescott a new No. 1 wide receiver.\n\nHe comes just in time to boost a passing game that ranks a lowly 29th in the NFL. Dallas made another change during its bye-week break by firing offensive line coach Paul Alexander and promoting former Cowboys lineman Marc Colombo.\n\nMaybe the shake-ups will help energize the Cowboys, who are looking to improve to 4-0 at home.\n\nThe Titans are looking to change their luck a bit, too. They have lost three in a row, but two of those defeats were by one point each.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

What mattered most tonight was the team and how we played.\"\n\nThe Niners (2-7) couldn't have played much better in snapping a six-game losing streak and winning for just the second time in two years without Jimmy Garoppolo at quarterback.\n\nMullens threw TD passes to Pierre Garcon and Kendrick Bourne on the opening two drives and connected on a 71-yard one-handed catch-and-run play to George Kittle to set up a third TD pass to Kittle. Raheem Mostert added a 52-yard TD run and the defense generated eight sacks for the first time since 2009.\n\nBut the story of the game was Mullens, got rid of the ball quickly and took advantages of several breakdowns in coverage for big plays, including the 24-yard TD pass to a wide-open Garcon on the opening drive.\n\n\"It was cool that he didn't change under the big lights and these circumstances,\" cornerback Richard Sherman said. \"We're not really surprised. We've seen him do it in practice. He plays with a lot of confidence.\"\n\nWith Garoppolo out for the season and Beathard having lost nine of 10 career starts, the inevitable question will be whether Mullens will take over as starter for the next game Nov. 12 against the New York Giants.\n\n\"We'll definitely consider it,\" coach Kyle Shanahan said. \"I'm definitely not thinking about it right now. Our whole team played very well. They definitely did.\"\n\nThe Raiders (1-7) clearly didn't, losing for the fourth straight time, getting outscored by 85 points during the skid.\n\n\"I know it's not looking pretty right now,\" coach Jon Gruden said. \"I've heard a lot of negativity over the last six, seven months and rightfully so. But we're going to build a championship football team here.\"\n\nIn what was perhaps the worst prime-time matchup in NFL history, only the Raiders played down to expectations. They provided little resistance on defense against an undrafted quarterback making his NFL debut, did nothing offensively after driving for as field goal on the opening drive and put together the most listless performance yet in Gruden's second stint as coach.\n\nCarr finished 16 for 22 for 171 yards and was sacked seven times before being replaced by AJ McCarron in the fourth quarter. McCarron was sacked once behind a banged-up offensive line.\n\n\"It's a frustrating thing to be sitting on the record you have, be going through some of the things we're going through as an offense and still not being able to put points on the board,\" tight end Jared Cook said. \"It's definitely frustrating because we know the talent we have in this room is way better than that and way better than what we portray on the field.\"\n\nUNDER PRESSURE\n\nCarr was sacked four times in the first half for the first time in his career as the Raiders struggled to provide much protection against a 49ers defense that has not generated much pressure all year. Dekoda Watson had 1 1/2 sacks in his first game of the season after getting activated from IR earlier in the day.\n\nRING CEREMONY\n\nFormer Niners receiver Terrell Owens was presented his Hall of Fame ring at a halftime ceremony. Owens was voted into the Hall of Fame earlier this year but skipped the induction ceremony in Canton, Ohio, to hold his own celebration at his college in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Owens said he was upset at the voters who made him wait three years for the honor, saying he believed they brought in off-field issues into their deliberations instead of focusing solely on what Owens did as a player.\n\n\"This is awesome,\" Owens said before the game. \"This is an opportunity to give something to the fans. Ever since I left in 2003 and went on and did some great things, but this is where it started my first eight years of my career.\"\n\nINJURIES\n\nRaiders left tackle Kolton Miller left with a knee injury. ...

Buzz60\n\nIllustration of coconut oil (Photo: rodrigobark, Getty Images/iStock)\n\nCompounds derived from coconut oil have been found to repel some insects better than DEET, a synthetic chemical considered the \"gold standard\" of repellents, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture bulletin published Wednesday.\n\nThe release highlights a study by USDA researchers published on Sept. 19 in the journal Scientific Reports. The study found that fatty acids derived from coconut oil had long-lasting insect-repelling properties against flies, ticks, bed bugs and mosquitoes.\n\nLead researcher Junwei Zhu notes that compounds extracted from coconut oil \u2013 not the oil itself \u2013 were found as an effective repellent, according to a USDA release.\n\n\"Coconut oil itself is not a repellent,\" the release says.\n\nThe findings are significant in part because of safety concerns associated with DEET, a chemical used first used as an insect repellent by the military during World War II, the study says.\n\n\"DEET is an effective repellent, but it can sometimes come with some serious side effects like rashes, disorientation and even seizures, so our experts say you should avoid products with more than 30 percent DEET,\" Consumer Reports' Theresa Panetta said in a 2015 report.\n\nBut Panetta at that time had few alternatives to offer, saying many \"natural and herbal repellents were not very effective at all\" in testing.\n\nZhu's study says many natural repellents quickly lose their effect on insects.\n\nThat wasn't the case for the coconut oil compounds, according to Zhu's research.\n\nThe USDA release says the coconut oil compounds out-preformed DEET at repelling stable flies, with an effective rate greater than 95 percent, compared with DEET's 50 percent.\n\nThe release says the coconut oil compounds repelled bed bugs and ticks for two weeks, as compared with DEET's three days of effectiveness.\n\nHowever, the study notes that a much greater concentration of coconut oil acids are required to effectively repel mosquitoes as compared with DEET.\n\nStudy authors say they are hopeful the research could result in the development of coconut oil-based insect repellent products to fight diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. The study notes existing commercial applications of coconut oil: \"coconut fatty acids are considered non-toxic, and are widely used in the food and cosmetic industries.\"\n\nThe study also says the results could yield affordable agriculture products for cattle.\n\nA leading manufacturer of DEET did not immediately respond to a USA TODAY request for comment on the study.\n\nCoconut oil has made headlines as some researchers have spoken out against purported health benefits of the oil in weight loss.

(AP Photo/Nell Redmond) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 James Borrego wasn't upset Russell Westbrook put up 29 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds against his team Thursday night. He expected that from the seven-time All-Star.\n\nWhat bothered Charlotte's first-year coach is that Alex Abrines had 25 points on five 3-pointers and Dennis Schroder was able to get to the rim effectively and add 21 more, helping the Oklahoma Thunder overcame a 19-point deficit to beat Borrego's Hornets 111-107 for their third straight win.\n\nBorrego called it \"game plan errors.\"\n\nPaul George had a different explanation: that's just the way Westbrook impacts games. He called the seven-time All-Star \"one of the baddest dudes in the league.\"\n\nAbrines deflected praise for his big game to Westbrook, saying all he had to do was make open shots.\n\n\"The defense has two options \u2014 come in and help and leave me open or stay attached to me and (Westbrook) is going to get layups,\" Abrines said. \"Sometimes you just stay in the corner and wait for the pass to come.\"\n\n\"Alex has to be ready to shoot the ball, he's a shooter and he knows how to play the game of basketball,\" Westbrook said.\n\nWestbrook did his part, hurting the Hornets in transition, with pull-up jumpers and in pick and rolls, a few of which resulted in highlight reel dunks. He also helped limit Kemba Walker to 21 points.\n\nThe Thunder made a concerted effort to slow down Walker, who came in averaging 30 points per game. Walker failed to make a field goal before the break and had just three points, although the Hornets still led 48-44 at halftime.\n\nWalker came to life in the third with 10 straight points to help the Hornets push their lead to 19.\n\nWestbrook led the Thunder back.\n\nWith 1:12 left, he drove and found an open Dennis Schroder with a crosscourt pass for an open 3-pointer. After a Charlotte miss, Westbrook used a screen from Steven Adams to get by Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for a layup to push the lead to 108-102. Westbrook punctuated the win with a ferocious dunk with 13 seconds left off a fast break before stopping to glare at the crowd.\n\nTIP INS\n\nThunder: Were 8 of 37 from 3-point range.\n\nHornets: Charlotte entered with 104 3-pointers, tied for the second most ever through eight games behind last season's Golden State Warriors (107). ...

Borrego said he is fine.\n\nGEORGE'S DEAD FOOT\n\nGeorge had a rough night, shooting 4 of 20 from the field and finishing with 11 points. After the game, George revealed he's been dealing with a peroneal nerve palsy or \"dead foot.\"\n\n\"I am just trying to play through that,\" George said. \"It's nothing major or that is going to hurt me. It's just something that is going to come back when it feels right.\"\n\nSTRATEGY ON WALKER\n\nThunder coach Billy Donovan joked he wasn't giving away his strategy for slowing down Walker in the first half since they have to play the Hornets again.\n\n\"It was a collective team effort and we did a really good job,\" Donovan said. \"You have to do a good job in pick and roll coverage and you have to be persistent because he's really shifty. He looks like he is giving up on the play and you bail out and there he goes.\"\n\nSaid Walker: \"They were blitzing me the whole game, so I kind of got a few of my baskets early in the third in transition. But yeah everyone is switching now, but for the most part in the pick and roll they were blitzing me.\"\n\nWESTBROOK'S TECH\n\nWestbrook got a technical foul early for screaming \"and one\" after a driving layup after the foul wasn't called.

USA TODAY\n\nFormer Cleveland Browns head coach Hue Jackson reacts on the sidelines in the first quarter against the New Orleans Saints at Mercedes-Benz Superdome. (Photo: Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHue Jackson was fired as head coach of the Cleveland Browns on Monday with his record with the team now infamously standing at 3-36-1.\n\nBut in his first major comments since he was let go, Jackson \u2013 in a sitdown interview with Cleveland.com \u2013 expressed his wishes that he had gotten more time to fix the offense and placed some blame for the team's struggles under him on the previous front-office regime.\n\n\"The fact that we played four overtime games (this year) says that we were a better football team. In my mind, if we fix the offense \u2013 it's a totally different story,\" Jackson said. \"So I do believe the move (to let him go) was premature. But I think a part of the problem again went back to the first two years.\"\n\nIn Jackson's first two years, when they were led by analytically inclined GM Sashi Brown, the team went 1-31.\n\n\"The problem was that the analytics and football (people) were not on the same page on who the premium players were and what their value to a football team would be,\" Jackson said of the team's draft strategy before GM John Dorsey's arrival.\n\n\"This was more a people problem of collaboration than just an analytics problem. We were getting worse as a team \u2013 and the NFL is set up for bad teams to get better not worse.''\n\nJackson said he expects Baker Mayfield to be a \"sensational player,\" but he was clearly disappointed that the Browns didn't address their quarterback needs sooner.\n\n\"You can't pass on quarterbacks. You never pass on a potential franchise quarterback because you don't know who's going to be there in the future,\" Jackson said.\n\nSpecifically, he expressed the most excitement over Carson Wentz, whom the Eagles traded up with the Browns to land at No. 2 overall in 2016.\n\n\"Did I like Carson Wentz? Hell yes,\" Jackson said, adding, \"But the plan was never to take a quarterback that year. It was all about trading back to get picks. If you're doing that, you've got to pick the right players.\"\n\nMore: In firing Hue Jackson, Browns once again left to pay for lack of plan\n\nMore: Of course Browns promote Gregg Williams, the coach behind Bountygate scandal\n\nStill, Jackson wishes he got time to work directly with Mayfield and the offense \u2013 while saying that issues with since-fired offensive coordinator Todd Haley were more about the lack of production and \"disagreements\" rather than \"internal discord.\" Jackson also said he was \"recommended\" to bring in an offensive coordinator \"to allow me to focus on leading the organization.\"\n\nThe Browns are 24th in scoring offense at 21.1 points per game.\n\n\"If you're going to go out, you always go out betting on yourself,\" Jackson said. \"I knew that I would've taken our same system and turned the offense around. It was not what I wanted to do, it's what I had to do. If I couldn't turn it around \u2013 then so be it and we move on.\"\n\nAs for the Browns as a franchise, Jackson referred to winning big with them as being the \"Mount Everest of the NFL.\"\n\n\"It's extremely difficult. Not for everybody,\" Jackson said. \"But if you can conquer it, your legacy becomes cemented.\"\n\nThe Browns' penchant for front-office and coaching changes clearly hurt the team and Jackson's reputation, the coach said.\n\n\"I believe the constant changes only compound the difficulties for the next person to have the time and patience to be successful. I strongly believe that I did a lot of work in a short time of laying the foundation for turning the place around,\" Jackson said. \"It's unfortunate that they took the approach they did the first two years because those were two years that I couldn't get back from a record and value standpoint.\n\n\"Had we been doing in Year 1 what I was able to get us to do in Year 3, there's no question we would already be a winning football team. You can't go 1-15 or 0-16 and have people like you unless you come out and explain to everyone that you're going to lose. And you can't say that publicly.\n\n\"The problem again was there's this perception that all of a sudden, I somehow forget how to run an offense, develop QBs or coach a football team. But this was the perception and stigma placed on the coaches that come before me in Cleveland. They were good coaches before they came to Cleveland \u2013 and they have remained good coaches after leaving Cleveland.\"\n\nDespite everything that has happened between him and the team, Jackson is optimistic about the Browns' future.\n\n\"I believe we laid the right foundation this time around,\" he said.", "", "FILE--In this Jan. 25, 2016, file photo Atlanta Hawks guard Lamar Patterson stand on the court in the second half of an NBA basketball game in Denver.

Control of Congress is on the line as is the fate of Donald Trump's presidency. (Nov. 1) AP\n\nJames O'Keefe, president of Project Veritas Action. His conservative group known for undercover investigations has been linked to a woman who falsely told the Washington Post that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore impregnated her as a teenager. (Photo: AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Activists with the right-wing group Project Veritas embedded with campaigns of unknowing Democrats across the country ahead of the midterms. And in most cases, candidates didn't know they were a target until they saw the finished videos.\n\nSo far, the controversial group led by founder James O'Keefe, has posted undercover videos with liberal campaign workers or candidates in six tight races. And O'Keefe says more are to come in the days leading up to the midterms.\n\n\"It's trying to get as much done in the short amount of time we have,\" O'Keefe told USA TODAY in a phone interview. His goal, he says, is to \"expose what these people really believe and think.\"\n\nO'Keefe's tactics of secretly recording targets to expose them have attracted a barrage of criticism over the years and many of the group's previous videos have been discredited partly because of the edits and cuts, allegations O'Keefe denied while talking to USA TODAY.\n\nDespite the controversy, the group's videos this cycle could hurt Democrats running in some of the nation's closest watched races, those that could decide which party controls Congress.\n\nThose known to have been targeted by the group in this election cycle include: Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and House candidate Abigail Spanberger.\n\nThe aim, O'Keefe says, is to expose the beliefs of progressives who are running in mostly red states, those won by President Donald Trump in 2016. He says his stings have uncovered Democratic candidates being untruthful to woo moderates in their state.\n\nHe says he doesn't need to be liked by the elite and calls his videos the \"purest form of journalism\" because there is no spin or opinion, rather just the words of their targets.\n\nCLOSE Democrats are hoping for a 'blue wave' in the midterm elections, but they are defending more seats than they are challenging. Will they lose seats? USA TODAY\n\nMore: Right-wing activist group films undercover video of Kyrsten Sinema, staffers\n\nMore: Oregon Republicans ask for ethics investigation into Brown campaign\n\nBut O'Keefe has been accused of editing videos to misrepresent the context of conversations as well as other dubious acts that include a failed sting of the Washington Post. He was also convicted in 2010 of using a fake identity to get on to federal property during one of his projects.\n\nIn November 2017, the Post said it was approached by a woman who worked for Project Veritas. She tried to make false accusations against then-Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was already mired in a sexual misconduct scandal and would eventually lose the Alabama special election to Democrat Doug Jones.\n\nThat attempted sting was one example of what critics say are ongoing efforts by O'Keefe's group to discredit mainstream media and liberal groups.\n\nO'Keefe wouldn't say how the footage was captured in the six Democratic races but in at least three of the instances, a Project Veritas employee offered a fake name and posed as a campaign employee to gain access. O'Keefe said they use a \"variety of different methods and sources\" to get the footage.\n\nHe acknowledged the group's tactics are controversial but argued the secret recordings make people \"more honest\" and said to blame those who are making the comments because they're \"spilling the beans\" to a stranger.\n\n\"The truth is paramount, not our tactics,\" O'Keefe said in one recent video.\n\nMcCaskill called for a special prosecutor to investigate after one of the operatives posed as an intern and recorded the senator talking about wanting tighter gun laws and a campaign employee saying she supports abortion in an attempt to demonstrate she was hiding her views because of the tight race against the state's Attorney General Josh Hawley.\n\nMcCaskill called the secretive recordings \"illegal\" and a \"fraud.\"\n\nSinema, who is running in a tight race against Republican Rep. Martha McSally, called the undercover videos of her and staffers a \"stunt.\" While the goal may have been to uncover her secret views on topics, many of her comments caught by the group on gun laws and did not appear to strongly contrast with her public opinions on issues.\n\nIn the video, Sinema is captured talking about immigration, specifically that she believes reform is needed but a path to citizenship should be offered to those who haven't committed a crime.\n\nOne of her campaign officials was also captured discussing gun laws, saying the campaign \"can't be talking about an assault weapons ban\" if she wants to win.\n\nInstead, the campaign official said Sinema can lead on issues like background checks, the gun-show loophole and making it harder for people convicted of domestic violence to get guns.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, here thanking volunteers at her field office in Phoenix, is favored to win the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona.

He added that whereas candidates spend thousands on advertisements, his videos made the rounds on TV and online for free in many of these races.\n\nA video on Brown reportedly led to the Oregon Republican Party filing an ethics complaint on allegations she may have used taxpayer money for her campaign. Local media in Missouri covered the McCaskill sting as she continued to ask for an investigation. Local coverage in Tennessee of the video targeting Bredesen left his campaign on the defense.\n\nThat could possibly hurt Democrats in Tuesday's election, according to Jacob Neiheisel, an assistant professor of political science at the University at Buffalo.\n\n\"It might help move the needle for certain people, possibly older folks, who are the people who vote most consistently,\" Neiheisel said. He noted some of the comments made by Democrats might not be flattering to voters, especially moderates.\n\nBut, Neiheisel added, these tapes for the most part \"could just be reverberating in the echo chamber\" since right-wing media is one of the largest forums for Project Veritas.\n\nThe group's latest videos targeted House candidate Spanberger, who is in a tight race against Rep. Dave Brat for Virginia\u2019s 7th District. The undercover Project Veritas operative worked with the campaign but was discovered using a false name and exposed after her constant questioning raised red flags, according to the Washington Post.\n\nEmployees with Spanberger's campaign confronted the woman and told her to leave the building as workers throughout the campaign office recorded the interaction.\n\n\"Dirty tricks like these are the worst part of politics, and this is exactly what Abigail is running to change,\" Spanberger\u2019s campaign manager, Dana Bye, told the Post.\n\nContributing: Rachel Leingang of the Arizona Republic\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/01/midterms-project-veritas-infiltrated-several-democratic-campaigns/1838657002/", "FILE - In this April 19, 2018, file photo, Cleveland Browns general manager John Dorsey answers questions about the draft during a news conference at the NFL football team's training camp facility, in Berea, Ohio.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 John Dorsey's roughest week running the Browns will close with a reunion.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were once his football family \u2014 before the feud.\n\nOn Sunday, Cleveland's first-year general manager will get an up-close look at the team he helped build into a Super Bowl contender playing against the one he's trying to revive after years of decay \u2014 and just days after another coaching clean-out.\n\nDorsey served as Kansas City's GM from 2013 to 2017, and was instrumental in the team drafting quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who leads the NFL with 26 touchdown passes, and in just his second year, has become the face of K.C's franchise.\n\nBefore he was fired by the Chiefs, Dorsey also selected running back Kareem Hunt, wide receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 a trio of options who have sped up Mahomes' development.\n\n\"John picked 'em,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said this week. \"Yeah. He picked 'em.\"\n\nIt was an honest admission from Reid, who arrived with Dorsey in 2013 and appeared to win a power struggle when the GM was surprisingly let go in 2017, not long after the Chiefs gave their coach a contract extension.\n\nThe team has never given a direct reason for Dorsey's firing.\n\nOn a conference call this week, Reid didn't want to get into specifics about his relationship with Dorsey or why Brett Veach was promoted to replace him.\n\n\"I am friends with John. I have been friends with John. I will leave it at that,\" Reid told Cleveland reporters. \"Things happen, and it happened. I have the utmost respect for him. You just watch how he gets that thing turned around right there.\"\n\nMahomes wasn't with Dorsey for very long, but got to know him during the pre-draft process.\n\n\"Dorse is an awesome guy,\" Mahomes said. \"He is the guy who sent the pick in and got me. He is an awesome talent evaluator, as well as a guy. It was nice to get to know him for a little amount of time.\"\n\nIn the 10-plus months he's been on the job in Cleveland, Dorsey has disassembled the team's roster, added talent through free agency and the draft and maybe found the team's franchise QB in rookie Baker Mayfield.\n\nThere's plenty of work ahead, but Reid believes the Browns have the right man in charge.\n\n\"I think John is going to do a phenomenal job for you guys,\" he said. \"He has already done it. You have seen what he has done. You guys are in good hands.\"\n\nMAHOMES-MAYFIELD PART II\n\nThe previous time they squared off, Mahomes and Mayfield broke records and nearly the scoreboard.\n\nMayfield passed for 545 yards and seven touchdowns, Mahomes had five and they rolled up over 1,700 total yards in 2016. Mayfield led Oklahoma to a 66-59 win over Texas Tech.\n\n\"That game was crazy, a lot of numbers, but I wish we'd have come out with a win at the end,\" said Mahomes, who passed for 734 yards.\n\nMahomes also had another big number the Browns can't let him duplicate.\n\n\"They were 20 of 25 on third down,\" he said. \"I think if we can keep them from completing 20 of 25 third downs, then we will have a better chance of winning.\"\n\nBUILT FORD TOUGH\n\nChiefs linebacker Dee Ford was the AFC defensive player of the week after sacking the Broncos' Case Keenum three times and stripping him twice of the ball. Ford has eight sacks this season and, perhaps more importantly, has remained healthy after a career marked by a series of nagging injuries in his first four seasons.\n\n\"Just to see him back enjoying the game and playing at the level he is, man, I'm just happy for the kid,\" Reid said.\n\nSTRETCHING THE RULES\n\nThe Chiefs defended how they use downfield blocks on their run-pass options this week after the Broncos argued their offensive linemen are cheating. Broncos coach Vance Joseph said he noticed several instances in which they headed downfield early, setting up blocks against the Denver linebackers and helping turn short gains into big ones.\n\n\"I haven't heard that but I can tell you what we tell them. It's timing and we keep it as precise as we can,\" Reid said. \"I always ask officials beforehand if there's anything I need to tell my guys and that's never been an issue.\"\n\nBRAGGING RIGHTS\n\nBrowns interim coach Gregg Williams raised some eyebrows by boasting he's had other chances to coach since being fired in 2003 by Buffalo.\n\n\"I have had 11 letters sent in to interview for head coaching jobs,\" he said. \"Four of them I did not even have to show up. Just sign the contract and come.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear if Williams was joking, but he stood by his comments.\n\nThe next day, new Browns offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens took a playful jab at his colleague.\n\n\"I thought this was going to come up, but it didn't come up and I want to address it,\" Kitchens said to end his first news conference. \"I have not been offered any head coaching jobs.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dave Skretta in Kansas City contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Halfway through Steve Wilks' initial season as head coach, the Arizona Cardinals have two victories.\n\nBoth have come against the lowly San Francisco 49ers. Things get tougher from here on out. After taking this weekend off, the Cardinals play at Kansas City. The schedule also features games at the Los Angeles Chargers, Green Bay and Atlanta. And there's that final home game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSo wins are going to be hard to come by for a team that sputtered to a 2-6 start, topping 20 points in a game only once. So the main focus from this point forward is developing rookie quarterback Josh Rosen.\n\nTo offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich, Rosen is simply \"the kid.\"\n\n\"The kid can really play,\" Leftwich said. \"His demeanor allows him to have success. Quarterbacking in this league is hard and when things go bad this kid tends to be fine. He's OK in those situations. Like I said, he can really play and it's just my job to get him in position that he's doing the right things.\"\n\nLeftwich knows Rosen well. He was the quarterbacks coach before being promoted to coordinator after Mike McCoy was fired seven games into the season.\n\n\"I'm just trying to get him better,\" Leftwich said. \"Our goal is to come out here and get this kid better every day in every form and fashion. There's not any specifics. I'm working on this kid the whole way, the whole way we're just trying to install the things we need to install in him so this kid could be playing 15 or 20 years.\"\n\nRosen took over the worst offense in the league late in the third game of the season (a home loss to Chicago) and has held the job ever since. He didn't talk to reporters this week but praised Leftwich after Sunday's 18-15 come-from-behind win over the 49ers.\n\n\"The one thing I think Byron is really good with is his demeanor,\" Rosen said. \"He's played the game, he's been in a lot of big-time situations, so I think he has really good timing with a lot of his play calls, he's got really good poise. He's a steading force for us on offense.\"\n\nThe Arizona offense sputtered for three quarters before Rosen threw two fourth-quarter touchdowns, a 13-yarder to Larry Fitzgerald and the game-winner, a 9-yarder to the back of the end zone to fellow rookie Christian Kirk, with 34 seconds to play.\n\nThe Cardinals were able to get running back David Johnson into open space a little bit more than they had, and the defense shut down San Francisco's strong running game most of the afternoon.\n\nWilks, whose coaching experience is entirely on the defensive side of the ball, likes what he's seen from Leftwich, who played nine seasons at quarterback in the NFL but is a relative newcomer to coaching.\n\n\"I think he's going to continue to try to be creative in his approach and really try to put the guys in a position to be successful,\" Wilks said.\n\nRosen approaches the coming weeks with that even-keeled confidence even though Leftwich is his fifth coordinator in four years, counting his time at UCLA.\n\nThe Cardinals also try to move on from the distraction of three-time All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson's request to be traded. He backed off the request after a meeting with team president Michael Bidwill and has two years left on his contract.\n\nWilks called on Peterson to speak in the huddle after the San Francisco win.\n\n\"What was said and what was talked about last week is in the past,\" Wilks said. \"Patrick is a captain. He's a leader on this football team. Again, I want him to have a voice, and that's what he wanted to do, and I gave him that opportunity.\"\n\nNotes: Wilks said he expects DT Corey Peters (ankle) and RG Justin Pugh (hand) to be back next week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Terrell Owens came back to his roots to get his Hall of Fame ring.\n\nOwens was presented with the ring during a halftime ceremony during Thursday night's game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Oakland Raiders.\n\nOwens spent the first eight seasons with the 49ers, establishing himself as one of the best players in the game during his tenure in San Francisco.\n\n\"This is awesome,\" Owens said before the game, while wearing his gold Hall of Fame jacket. \"This is an opportunity to give something to the fans. Ever since I left in 2003 and went on and did some great things, but this is where it started my first eight years of my career.\"\n\nOwens was voted into the Hall of Fame earlier this year but skipped the induction ceremony in Canton, Ohio, to hold his own celebration at his college in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOwens said he was upset at the voters who made him wait three years for the honor, saying he believed they brought in off-field issues into their deliberations instead of focusing solely on what Owens did as a player.\n\n\"No regrets at all,\" Owens said about his decision to skip the ceremony. \"If anybody knows who Terrell Owens is outside the media portrayal of me throughout the course of my career. They know what I did. I stand by what I did. ... When they tried to bring other things outside my body of work and my accomplishments, that was an issue for me. My stats spoke loudly. They spoke for themselves.\"\n\nOwens had a mostly sensational 15-year career playing for San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas, Buffalo and Cincinnati. He played eight years with the 49ers before bouncing around the league as he frequently wore out his welcome at all of his stops along the way.\n\nBut he always produced, ranking second all-time to Jerry Rice in yards receiving (15,934) and third to Rice and Randy Moss with 153 touchdown catches. He was a five-time All-Pro, a six-time Pro Bowl pick and one of the most entertaining players of his generation.\n\n\"I can't look back and say I would have done anything differently,\" he said. \"I wanted to be a 49er for the rest of my career if that could happen, But not many people start and finish where they started. Look at Jerry (Rice), look at Joe Montana.\"\n\nOwens was part of eight playoff teams but only reached the Super Bowl once after joining the Eagles in 2004. He gave a heroic performance in Philadelphia's 24-21 loss to New England, catching nine passes for 122 yards after defying doctor's orders and returning to play on his surgically repaired ankle 6\u00bd weeks after an operation.\n\nOwens had many memorable moments in his career, but the one that stands out most for him from his time with the 49ers came in a playoff game Jan. 3, 1999, against Green Bay.\n\nAfter dropping several passes early in the game, Owens caught the game-winning 25-yard touchdown in the final seconds in a play dubbed \"The Catch 2,\" as the sequel to Dwight Clark's game-winner in the 1981 NFC title game against Dallas.\n\nOwens then was selected an All-Pro for the first time the following season.\n\n\"That was a big catalyst for my career,\" he said. \"For me to come up with a big play at that particular time was monumental, very key for the development of me. It helped my confidence.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Titans are coming off the open week, preceded by a solid bounce-back game for Mariota after he was sacked 11 times _ one shy of the NFL record _ in a shutout loss to Baltimore. They will face the Dallas Cowboys on Monday, Nov. 5, 2018. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Dak Prescott has a new No. 1 receiver and there's a fresh leading voice for the Dallas quarterback's blockers after the Cowboys traded for Amari Cooper and fired offensive line coach Paul Alexander during an open week that was much busier than normal.\n\nAnd there's little question about the message owner and general manager Jerry Jones is sending as the Cowboys try to keep a perfect home season intact to offset their winless road mark in a Monday night visit from the Tennessee Titans, who share the same record (3-4) and sense of urgency because of a three-game losing streak.\n\n\"We're more urgent because we've dug a hole here,\" Jones said on his radio show. \"In order to really be where we want to be, which that (is) in the playoffs, then we've got to be pretty strong in our success here. We don't have time here. We don't have the room to wiggle here.\"\n\nThe Cowboys gave Oakland their upcoming first-round draft pick for Cooper because the receivers simply haven't made the big plays the coaching staff and front office hoped would still be there despite the offseason release of Dez Bryant in a cost-cutting move.\n\nDallas dumped Alexander in the middle of his first season and promoted former Cowboys lineman Marc Colombo because a front that has been among the NFL's best for several years simply hasn't been as good, with or without Travis Frederick. The four-time Pro Bowl center hasn't played and remains out indefinitely with a nerve disorder.\n\nNow it's time to see how some midseason upheaval, which included bringing retired former offensive line coach Hudson Houck out of retirement to help Colombo, translates to the field.\n\n\"I don't think it'll be that much of a change,\" right tackle La'el Collins said. \"It's more so just us being able to do a lot of different things that we've done in the past, just kind of getting back to us playing at a high level and being more effective.\"\n\nThe Titans are also coming off the bye week , preceded by a solid bounce-back game for Marcus Mariota after he was sacked 11 times \u2014 one shy of the NFL record \u2014 in a shutout loss to Baltimore.\n\nMariota had a season-best 75 percent completion percentage (24 of 32) for 237 yards with a touchdown and an interception in a 20-19 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers \u2014 the second one-point loss on the current skid.\n\nStill, the Titans have the 30th-ranked offense and passing game in the NFL. And the Cowboys aren't much better at 28th and 29th.\n\n\"I think everybody across the offense has a sense of urgency,\" said Mariota, who turned 25 this week. \"If we can carry that throughout the entirety of a game, I think we can be efficient. We can do well on third downs. We can score touchdowns.\"\n\nSome other things to know with the Titans and Cowboys set for a Monday night showdown:\n\nSTILL IN THE HUNT\n\nBoth teams have been fortunate not to lose touch with the top of their divisions.\n\nThe Titans have been overtaken by Houston's five-game winning streak in the AFC South, but are just one loss behind the Texans (5-3) in the loss column. The Cowboys have the same number of losses as Super Bowl champion Philadelphia (4-4) and can pull back even with the idle Eagles in the NFC East. Washington has a shot at a two-game cushion in a visit to Atlanta.\n\nTHE RUNDOWN\n\nThe Titans are 19th in the NFL running the ball even with Derrick Henry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner, and Dion Lewis in the backfield.\n\nThe Titans signed fullback Jalston Fowler to the roster after returning from their bye, and coach Mike Vrabel made it clear they want to run the ball better. Dallas star Ezekiel Elliott is coming off the second-worst game of his career, a 33-yard showing in a 20-17 loss to the Redskins.\n\nDEFENSIVE SHOWDOWN\n\nDallas is giving up just 17.6 points per game, second in the NFL and one spot ahead of Tennessee at 18.1. The Titans are the NFL's best inside an opponent's 20, while the Cowboys are second.\n\n\"It's going to be the battle of the red zone,\" Titans linebacker Wesley Woodyard said. \"Bend, but don't break. That's been our mentality on defense.\"\n\nINCORPORATING COOPER\n\nCooper spent several days with Cowboys receivers coach Sanjay Lal in California. They went to a park in Oakland to work on routes, and Cooper had some video phone calls with Prescott to try to speed the process of learning one another.\n\nNO MORE GLOVE\n\nMariota said he is no longer wearing a partial glove that he was using to help with lingering numbness and tingling after injuring his elbow in the season opener.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It's clear the 54-year-old Payton admires what the Rams' 32-year-old, similarly offensive-minded head coach has accomplished in just his first season-and-a-half as a head coach.\n\n\"I am a huge fan of Sean's and I have gotten to know him and have a ton of respect for what he has done going on his second year,\" Payton said of McVay, adding that he \"absolutely\" makes a point of watching the Rams throughout the season.\n\n\"They're a must-watch team,\" Payton said.\n\nThe admiration is mutual when McVay discusses Payton's offense.\n\n\"I look at their tape every week, see what they're doing,\" McVay said. \"I also appreciate the aggressive nature that coach Payton comes after people.\n\n\"That mindset of never being afraid to fail and always attacking is something that we try to do,\" McVay added. \"It demonstrates a confidence and belief in your players.\"\n\nSome other story lines surrounding the Rams-Saints showdown, the winner of which will have the inside track to the No. 1 playoff seeding in the conference:\n\nCOACH-QB COMBOS\n\nThe Saints have been among the NFL leaders in offense since Payton arrived in New Orleans and recruited then-free agent Drew Brees to join him in 2006.\n\nCurrently, the Saints rank eighth in yards per game (389.9) and second in points per game (33.4). The Rams offense, with 2016 top overall draft choice Jared Goff under center, rank second in yards (442.6) and third in scoring (33).\n\nEach team's head coach-QB tandem mirror one another in that Payton and McVay both call offensive plays, putting a premium on their communication and relationship with their quarterbacks. The difference is that Payton and the 39-year-old Brees have been together far longer, and Brees has set prestigious NFL passing records .\n\n\"Those guys are two of the best ever to do it together,\" the 24-year-old Goff said. \"Me and Sean (McVay) have a great relationship, and hopefully it'll continue to grow.\"\n\nDEFENSIVE DISPARITY\n\nThe Rams already had the league's eighth-ranked defense before the addition of edge pass-rusher Dante Fowler at Tuesday's NFL trade deadline. In seven games with Jacksonville this season, Fowler's highlights included two sacks and a forced fumble. It's unclear how much he'll play right away, but is expected to rotate into the game on some passing downs.\n\n\"I don't really know how they're going to use him yet, but I watched some film on him,\" Saints right tackle Ryan Ramczyk said. \"He's a good athlete, a good player, so I'll be prepared.\"\n\nThe Saints rank 23rd in total defense \u2014 28th against the pass \u2014 but have been opportunistic. Defensive back P.J. Williams' past outing in Minnesota was a case in point. He was beaten several times on Minnesota receptions, but also helped force a fumble that resulted in one TD and ran back an interception for a score.\n\nFULL KUPP\n\nThe Rams' biggest lineup addition this week might not be Fowler: They expect to have receiver Cooper Kupp back in uniform after a two-game absence with a knee injury.\n\nThe second-year target's presence would be a boon for Goff, who found Kupp for a team-leading 869 yards receiving last season.\n\nGOFF'S RETURN\n\nGoff made his second career start at the Superdome in 2016. While those woebegone Rams were routed 49-21 , Goff emerged with the highest passer rating in any game of his rookie season, along with his first three NFL touchdown passes.\n\n\"It maybe gave me some confidence knowing that being in a hostile environment like that and being able to make plays was something that I saw myself do and was able to kind of grow from that experience,\" Goff said.\n\nNow a smooth leader of McVay's well-oiled offensive machine, Goff gets his chance to show the Superdome faithful what he has learned since.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Thousand Oaks, California, contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Bradley Chubb has made up for a slow September start in a big way.\n\nThe Denver Broncos' rookie edge rusher was honored as the NFL's top rookie defender for the month of October after collecting 16 tackles, 12 of them solo, 5\u00bd sacks, five tackles for loss, 13 pressures, eight QB hits, a forced fumble and a pass breakup in five games last month.\n\nHe joined Von Miller (November 2011) and linebacker D.J. Williams (December 2004) as the only Broncos to win the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month award.\n\n\"I'm nowhere near where I want to be,\" Chubb said Thursday. \"I'm happy for the achievement, but ... I want to be 8-0 right now with multiple rookie of the months. This is my first one, so I'm still hungry to get more and for this team to get more wins.\"\n\nThe Broncos (3-5) host the Houston Texans (5-3) on Sunday.\n\nChubb said it took him a few games to get used to being chipped by tight ends and running backs.\n\n\"It's different because in college it's pretty much 1-on-1 the whole time,\" Chubb said. \"I feel like I'm more comfortable now.\"\n\nAnd making quarterbacks uncomfortable.\n\nChubb is only the seventh rookie since 1982 to record at least 5\u00bd sacks over a three-game span and the first since Aldon Smith of the 49ers did it in 2011.\n\nMiller said he figured his pass rushing partner would quickly hit his stride after his September struggles, especially in covering tight ends for the first time in his life.\n\nMiller compared Chubb to a prodigy .\n\n\"When you talk to him, you're not really talking to a rookie. He understands the language,\" Miller said. \"He may not be able to talk back and speak to you in the same language, but he definitely understands it and he's a quick learner, fast learner, mature beyond his age.\n\n\"I'm extremely excited about where he's at with his career and the hot start that he's had,\" Miller added. \"For him to get Defensive Rookie of the Month is huge. Not too many rookies out there are playing like him. He's got two more months and Defensive Rookie of the Year is in the bag for him.\"\n\nMiller won Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2011.\n\nChubb has seven sacks at the midway point of the season , putting him on pace to challenge for the rookie sacks record of 14\u00bd set by Tennessee's Jevon Kearse in 1999.\n\nMiller said one of the first things he advised Chubb to do after the Broncos selected him with the fifth overall pick of this year's draft was to write out his goals.\n\nAmong the goals Chubb scribbled down were \"sack record, win Defensive Rookie of the Year,\" Miller said. \"He even had goals five years down the road. A guy with that type of mentality and that work ethic, he'll definitely get all of the goals that he wrote on his paper.\"\n\nIt's become a race between Chubb and Miller, who has eight sacks, to get to the quarterback, like last week when they sandwiched Patrick Mahomes.\n\n\"I feel like every pass play we have an internal race to the quarterback,\" Chubb said. \"We might not say it out loud, but we want to get there first.\"\n\nNotes: RB Royce Freeman (ankle) returned to practice but didn't participate in any team drills Thursday. ... S Su'a Cravens could be activated off IR Friday. \"He's a guy who can play a (dime) linebacker position and also cover a tight end,\" coach Vance Joseph said. \"I think his skill set and his body type will help us play better defense.\" ... Joseph said Jared Veldheer (knee) will replace sub Billy Turner at right tackle Sunday. The Broncos are also considering having one of them move to the left side occasionally to give LT Garett Bolles a break.

Now he could help at safety after Clinton-Dix, a fifth-year starter, was traded this week to the Washington Redskins for a fourth-round draft pick.\n\nWilliams, a 12-year pro, started two games at safety while with the Cleveland Browns in 2016. Teammates have marveled about the veteran's leadership skills and fitness to stay in the league so long.\n\n\"He can find the football and he plays with good vision and has a good sense of when to break and just the understanding of football,\" Pettine said. \"He's played in the slot, he's played outside.

The Minnesota Vikings have reached the midpoint of their season with only one game played against a division opponent. They\u2019ll start a stretch of three straight NFC North contests by hosting the Detroit Lions, on Sunday, Nov. 4, who are in last place but just one game out of first. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 When Kirk Cousins and his family moved from Illinois to Michigan, his allegiance to the Bears was well-established.\n\nLeaving Chicagoland, Cousins wondered aloud to his dad whether they'd be required to become fans of the Lions and the other Detroit-area teams.\n\n\"He said, 'Kirk, you can take the boy out of Chicago. You can't take Chicago out of the boy,'\" Cousins recalled this week.\n\nLoyal to the Bears they remained, but inside Michigan's borders the Lions always received top TV billing. So Cousins moved through his teenage years and on to college at Michigan State with more than adequate coverage of the Lions, a clear familiarity that has only deepened now that Cousins has joined a different team in the NFC North in Minnesota.\n\nThe Vikings (4-3-1) will host the Lions (3-4) on Sunday, the first time Cousins, who's second in the NFL with 2,521 passing yards, will face his home state's squad as a division rival.\n\n\"I think with every game we play, I can point to something about the team or an opponent on the team or a coach or whatever it might be that makes you feel like you're living a dream,\" Cousins said, \"and certainly going against the Detroit Lions is no different being that I grew up in that state.\"\n\nWith the Bears (4-3) and Green Bay Packers (3-3-1) bunched in, too, this game will be the first of several in the second half of the season to shape a tight race.\n\n\"Division games count for two,\" Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford said. \"You get the win, and they get the loss. They're big games, and the more you can go and win those, whether on the road or at your place, the better. We have a big stretch of them coming up.\"\n\nHere are some other key angles to follow with the game:\n\nMATCHING MEGATRON\n\nAdam Thielen leads the NFL with 74 receptions and 925 yards for the Vikings. With at least 100 yards in each of the first eight games, Thielen has tied Lions legend Calvin Johnson for the longest streak in league history. Johnson's run was in 2012, when he set the all-time NFL record with 1,964 yards.\n\nAs a football-loving kid living in Minnesota, Thielen naturally tried to emulate Cris Carter and Randy Moss. But Johnson was another star wide receiver he closely watched. Johnson, who retired after the 2015 season, wore No. 21 in college at Georgia Tech. So did Thielen at Detroit Lakes High School, not coincidentally.\n\n\"He could block, he could run short routes, he could run deep routes, and he'd catch everything,\" Thielen said. \"When people were draped all over him, he'd still make the plays. I just remember a lot of games where Stafford would just throw the ball up, and there'd be three guys on him and he'd still come down with the ball.\"\n\nWith Stefon Diggs another dangerous option for Cousins, limiting Thielen has been even more of a challenge for opponents.\n\n\"We're going to have a hard time trying to handle him,\" coach Matt Patricia said. \"He runs really good routes. He has great change of direction. He can get vertically very quick. He understands zone coverage \u2014 he can sit down and find the open space \u2014 and he has great hands. So definitely will be a big issue for us.\"\n\nGOLDEN'S GONE\n\nThough Johnson caused the Vikings secondary plenty of problems over his nine years in the league, Golden Tate did his share of damage, too.\n\nIn the first four wins by the Lions over the Vikings since Zimmer was hired in 2014, twice in his first year and twice in 2016, Tate totaled 228 yards and two touchdowns on 30 catches while being targeted 38 times. That included his game-winning somersault into the end zone in overtime in Minnesota in 2016, after Vikings standouts Xavier Rhodes and Harrison Smith missed their attempts to tackle him.\n\nLast season, the Vikings limited Tate to just seven receptions for 36 yards over their two matchups. Now he's gone, having been traded to Philadelphia .\n\n\"I was surprised about that. He was their main guy on third downs. He was great with yards after the catch,\" Rhodes said, adding: \"It was one of those situations where you were like, 'Oh, let me check MY phone.'\"\n\nGRIFFEN GETTING GOING\n\nVikings defensive end Everson Griffen, who has 7\u00bd sacks in eight games against the Lions since becoming a starter in 2014, made his season debut last week after missing five games to seek mental health treatment. Griffen played 37 of 53 snaps against New Orleans.\n\n\"My No. 1 goal is just to keep on going out there and knocking the rust off more and more each day, but I'm feeling good,\" Griffen said.\n\nGAME ON THE GROUND\n\nAfter finishing last, third-to-last and last in the NFL in rushing over the previous three years, the Lions have revived their long-languishing ground game with the arrival of rookie Kerryon Johnson. With an average of nearly 110 yards per game, they're 16th in the league this week.\n\n\"It's mostly what the offensive line's doing. No matter how good a running back is, he needs the offensive line, period,\" Vikings defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson said. \"Ain't too many Barry Sanders in the league.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He was 9-5 with a 2.73 ERA this season.\n\nThe Dodgers and Roberts discussed a contract extension going back to spring training without reaching a deal. Roberts has said he expects to be back next year.\n\n\"It wasn't an issue at all to kind of table it and pick it up when we were done playing,\" Friedman said.\n\nBoth Friedman and general manager Farhan Zaidi expressed support for Roberts, who got booed during the World Series for some of his on-field decisions.\n\n\"We both feel very strongly that those strategic decisions are the result of a process,\" Zaidi said. \"We believe and we continue to have full confidence in his process. I also think when you start putting the microscope on little individual decisions it's also taking credit away from the other team.

Zaidi previously spent a decade working in Oakland's front office before joining the Dodgers four years ago.\n\n\"I'm not going to comment on that,\" he said. \"Right now my focus is on the Dodgers until you guys tell me otherwise.\"\n\nThe team's top free agents are:\n\n\u2014 Manny Machado. The shortstop was acquired from Baltimore in July and played outstanding defense. But he hit .182 in the World Series and drew ire for his admitted lack of hustle and overly aggressive base-running that earned him a $10,000 fine from Major League Baseball.\n\n\"It wasn't a great look,\" Friedman said. \"I don't think it got to the fact that he didn't care.

(Oct. 29) AP\n\nKen Parker, a former neo-Nazi, marched at the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville in 2017. (Photo: Fuuse Films)\n\nFor years, Ken Parker lived in a world of bigotry and hate.\n\nHe wore the green robes of a grand dragon in the Ku Klux Klan. He stood at lecterns and shouted racist catchphrases. He posed shirtless in a photo posted on Facebook, a swastika tattoo on his chest and a gun cradled in his arm.\n\nHe paid $30 to ride in a 15-person van from Jacksonville, Florida, to Charlottesville, Virginia, for the 2017 Unite the Right rally, where he marched as part of the National Socialist Movement contingent. They spit out slurs and anti-Semitic slogans, clashed with counterprotesters and celebrated the violence and chaos.\n\nWhen a neo-Nazi plowed into the crowd, killing Heather Heyer, who was there to stand against white nationalists, Parker and his crew were in a parking garage about a mile away, giddy over what they saw as a victorious day.\n\nParker was immersed in white supremacist ideology, radicalized by a steady diet of racist propaganda. Like Dylann Roof, who killed nine African-American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. Like Robert Bowers, who police said gunned down 11 Jewish worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nHate crimes leave grieving families and terrorized communities \u2013 from the Muslims whose Texas mosque was burned to the ground to the Indian-born immigrant gunned down in a Kansas bar to the two African-Americans killed last week in a Kentucky Kroger grocery store.\n\nAfter Charlottesville, something shifted inside Parker. He began to turn away from hate and toward the people he once might have targeted.\n\nWhy did Parker change? And how was the U.S. Navy veteran, who said he grew up in a \u201cgood Christian\u201d family outside Chicago, drawn to hate groups in the first place?\n\nThe answers offer insight into the dynamics feeding the spread of right-wing extremism.\n\nNeed, narrative, network\n\nIn many ways, Parker was the perfect recruit for the hate movement.\n\nAfter serving in the Navy for 11 years, he floundered. Scuffling to find a job in a bad economy. Trapped in a crumbling marriage. Seething about demographic changes that seemed to leave him behind.\n\nOne rainy night in early 2012, as he and his now-ex-wife shuffled through shows on Netflix, they stumbled on programs about neo-Nazi skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAs they watched the show about the KKK, the oldest hate group in the country, his wife turned to him. \"You should look them up,\" she said, according to Parker. \"They seem right up your alley.\"\n\nParker reached out to Klan groups he found through an online search and got a call within 15 minutes from the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. At first, he bristled at the anti-Semitic rhetoric the members tossed around, thinking it conflicted with the Christian teachings he had grown up with.\n\n\u201cWithin six months, I was head over heels,\u201d said Parker, 38. \u201cI was looking through my Bible just to put down Jewish people.\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s path is an almost textbook example of how hate group members are radicalized.\n\nThey often feel \u201cless than,\u201d searching for someone to blame, for some place to direct their rage, said Tony McAleer, a former leader of the White Aryan Resistance and co-founder of Life After Hate, which helps people leave hate groups.\n\nParker felt lost without the camaraderie and rank structure of the military \u2013 and even more alone after his marriage collapsed and his wife left him.\n\nArie Kruglanski, a social psychologist at the University of Maryland who has studied extremists around the world, calls that dynamic the three N\u2019s: need, narrative and network.\n\nThe \u201cneed\u201d is a basic human \u201cquest to matter, to be somebody, to have respect,\u201d Kruglanski said.\n\nIn some cases, that need for significance leads people to good deeds; in others, it leads to violent means. The deciding factor, Kruglanski explained, is the narrative to which they are exposed.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re exposed to a narrative that the way to attain significance is by contributing to society and helping others, then you would follow that particular course of action,\u201d Kruglanski said. \u201cHowever, if you're exposed to a narrative that tells you the way to do it is through violence, through fighting the enemy of your group or the enemy of your culture, then that is what you are going to do.\u201d\n\nThe third \u201cN\u201d refers to network \u2013 the community that rewards behavior and dispenses adulation and recognition.\n\nMourners visit the memorial outside the Tree of Life Synagogue on Oct. 31 in Pittsburgh. Eleven people were killed in a mass shooting. (Photo: Jeff Swensen, Getty Images)\n\nIn the 1980s, when McAleer first joined a group of racist skinheads as a student in England, it took months, sometimes years, for someone to be radicalized. They had to order books and material promoting racist beliefs through the mail and look for places to meet in person. Now, someone like Roof, whose descent into hate began with a Google search, can binge on white nationalism through YouTube videos and online forums such as 4chan.\n\nOnce in the KKK, Parker was further indoctrinated through weekly \u201cKlan class,\u201d a Bible study that used Scripture to advance racist beliefs, and a Klan website and chat room.\n\nHe attended his first Klan rally in May 2012, months after his first contact. Soon, he had risen to the rank of grand dragon, a reward for recruiting other members.\n\nAfter four years with the KKK, Parker broke away from the organization. Not because he had renounced racist beliefs but because of a woman, who is now his fiancee, whom he met at a cross-burning. The Klan disapproved of her because she associated with black people.\n\n\u201cI said, screw you,\u201d Parker recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s how I became a Nazi.\u201d\n\nThe rise of 'White Power'\n\nIn video footage, Parker stands at a lectern, wearing the black \u201cbattle dress\u201d uniform of the National Socialist Movement, one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in this country. Behind him, Confederate flags rustle in the breeze.\n\nHe rails against Muslims, refugees and Mexican immigrants and vows to \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to wipe out those groups. He flings his arm out in a Sieg Heil salute and chants, \u201cWhite Power.\u201d\n\nThe NSM, which has roots in the original American Nazi Party, espouses violent anti-Jewish rhetoric and warns of a \u201cwhite genocide.\"\n\nThe country's demographic changes are part of standard white supremacist talking points. Combined with easy online access to racist propaganda, it is what experts who track extremism call a perfect formula for the spread of hate.\n\n\u201cWhen these talking points slip into political debate, it lends legitimacy to it,\u201c said Keegan Hankes, senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cPeople get sucked into the echo chamber.\u201d\n\nThe alleged Pittsburgh synagogue shooter, who blamed Jews for the caravan of asylum seekers making its way north through Mexico, called the immigrants \u201cinvaders\u201d \u2013 echoing descriptions used by President Donald Trump and by pundits on the Fox cable news network.\n\nParker, who said he did not hear racist beliefs when he was growing up in a churchgoing Baptist family outside Chicago, absorbed the hate disseminated by the NSM on its website and on a radio station run by the neo-Nazi group, where it promotes an \u201call-white ethno-state.\u201d\n\nHe would let loose with racial slurs if someone from a different ethnicity bumped into him in a store. He was furious when the NSM changed its logo from a swastika to the Odal rune, another Nazi symbol the group thought would be more palatable to a mainstream audience.\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t wait to get to Unite the Right in Charlottesville.\n\n\u201cI was so pumped up,\u201d Parker said of the white nationalist rally in August 2017. \u201cEveryone was saying that we were going to start a revolution.\u201d\n\nIn reality, he realizes, they did not score a victory. Instead, a \u201cbunch of angry white guys got locked up for a long time,\u201d and an innocent woman was killed. \u201cHer mother doesn\u2019t have a daughter,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThat is not cool. At all.\u201d\n\nThe rally marked a turning point for Parker \u2013 through an unlikely encounter with a Muslim filmmaker.\n\nConfronting 'the enemy'\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is Ken Parker,\u201d Deeyah Khan narrates in her Netflix documentary \u201cWhite Right: Meeting the Enemy.\u201d \u201cKen is exactly the kind of person I\u2019ve always been afraid of.\u201d\n\nKhan, a British Norwegian filmmaker who was targeted by racists, went to Charlottesville to try to understand what drove people into hate groups. She found \u201cbroken men\u201d who were afraid \u2013 afraid of being marginalized by women and minorities, of being emasculated, of their own trauma and weakness.\n\nFilmmaker Deeyah Khan interviewed Ken Parker for her documentary, \"White Right: Meeting the Enemy.\" (Photo: Fuuse Films)\n\nShe found Parker, whom she followed back to his home in Jacksonville, Florida. There, as Khan\u2019s camera rolled, Parker made flyers with anti-Jewish slogans and swastikas that he tossed into front yards.\n\nAt first, he laughed and boasted about the hate act, then grew increasingly anxious as Khan questioned him about his actions. He listened as Khan read samples of racist e-mails she had received.\n\nFor Parker, who had often spewed the ugliest kind of anti-Muslim taunts, Khan\u2019s compassion and respect were revelatory. Khan, who said she had previously tried to combat fascism with angry demonstrations and in-your-face retorts, described her approach as a necessary way to retain her own humanity.\n\n\"I don't believe it's the job of minorities to reform racists or to have to engage with their abusers,\" Khan said. \"When we're confronted with people who hold such ugly views, who act out in such horrible and violent ways, it's hard to hold onto your own humanity. But I refuse to become like them.\"\n\nOn the last day of filming, Parker surprised Khan, the first Muslim person he had ever spent time with, by referring to her as a friend.\n\n\u201cWhat does this change?\u201d she asked him. \u201cWhat is this going to do for you moving forward?\u201d\n\nAfter Khan\u2019s documentary was completed, Parker watched it over and over. By the fifth or sixth viewing, he saw himself and the NSM with new eyes. \u201cI\u2019m like, dude, I look stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all look so stupid. This is foolish.\u201d\n\nShortly after that, Parker and his fiancee struck up a conversation with a neighbor \u2013 the pastor of an African-American church. Like Khan, the neighbor treated the couple with kindness, inviting them to Sunday service.\n\nThey became regulars at the All Saints Holiness Church, where they were welcomed by the African-American congregation.\n\nAt first, Parker could not discard what he saw as the brotherhood of the NSM, and he planned to go to a rally in Georgia.\n\nThe night before, he prayed to the Holy Spirit for guidance \u2013 and decided not to attend the rally. Instead, he sent a resignation e-mail to the National Socialist Movement.\n\n\u201cI could not keep living that lifestyle of hate,\u201d Parker said.\n\nJust as Parker\u2019s journey into the KKK and the NSM illustrates the pull of hate groups, his path out shows how extremists can be deradicalized.\n\n\u201cYou have to basically reverse the process,\u201d said Kruglanski, the social psychologist. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to convince potential recruits that this movement will not bring significance. It only brings humiliation and ignominy.\u201d\n\nThat counter-narrative must come not only from friends, Kruglanski said, but also from public officials and political leaders.\n\nChatham University students hug during a visit Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, to a makeshift memorial outside the Tree of Life synagogue dedicated to the 11 people killed Oct. 27 while worshipping, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

But what is birthright citizenship? And why was it added to the Constitution? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nIn the 2018 election campaign, Trump keeps sinking to new levels of fear and loathing on immigration, health care and fantasy tax cuts: Our view\n\nIn Pittsburgh on Oct. 30, 2018. (Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump's pre-election campaign of fear and loathing crested this week with a latter-day version of the infamous \"Willie Horton\" political ad of the 1980s.\n\nThe Horton ad highlighted a recidivist African-American felon and was widely condemned as playing to racist fears. So what was at the top of Trump's Twitter feed on Halloween? Footage of a grinning, twice-deported Mexican immigrant being sentenced to death for killing two California law officers, with a Trump admonition: \"It is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country.\"\n\nThe fact that Democrats had nothing to do with this man \u2014 or that undocumented immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans \u2014 is apparently of no matter as Trump stumps for Republican candidates around the USA. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called the ad \"sickening\" and \"just a new low in campaigning.\"\n\nGINGRICH: President Trump is reflecting anger, not creating it\n\n\"Be afraid, be very afraid\" is a time-honored political trope. But Trump is taking it to whole new levels:\n\n\u25baWhen a few thousand migrants broke through Guatemalan border fencing to enter Mexico last month and began hiking to the United States to seek asylum, it might have been prudent to supplement the Border Patrol agents and 2,000 National Guard troops already on hand with a few hundred active-duty service members for logistical support (they're barred by law from any enforcement action). But that wasn't dramatic enough for Trump. He declared a national emergency, described the migrants as invaders, and dispatched 5,200 troops to the border, with an additional 8,000 to possibly follow. That would create an army larger than the U.S. employs against the Taliban and terrorism in Afghanistan. It would also be enormously expensive; a government study found that a 2006 troop deployment to the border cost $120 per person per day.\n\n\u25baAdding to his anti-immigrant theatrics, Trump resurrected an unworkable campaign promise to deny citizenship to babies born in the USA to undocumented immigrants, a birthright that most legal scholars say is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment and a subsequent Supreme Court ruling. Trump boasted he could alter the Constitution with an executive order. Such an order, until blocked by a federal judge, could create a new underclass of infant children in legal and administrative limbo.\n\n\u25baWith health care emerging as a top election issue, Trump shamelessly promises at rallies to safeguard coverage of pre-existing conditions. Except he has done precisely the opposite, working unsuccessfully to undermine Obamacare's pre-existing coverage guarantee and adopting the same sort of \"Mediscare\" language that Democrats used to wield against Republicans.\n\nPerhaps the most cynical ploy was promising on Oct. 20 a 10 percent middle-class tax cut by this week. Of course, that hasn't happened. For one thing, Congress, which would have to approve the cut, is out of session. So Trump simply shifted gears and vaguely promised something after the election. The tax proposal, which came as news to legislators and even some White House staffers, is a grasping giveaway after his No. 1 legislative achievement \u2014 a $1.5 trillion tax cut package disproportionately benefiting the wealthy \u2014 landed with a deficit-swelling thud.\n\nThese flailing election gestures by the president range from prejudicial to unworkable to unaffordable. They represent sound and fury that ultimately signify little of substance.

(AP) \u2014 Bears coach Matt Nagy need not worry about any R-rated remarks that might have been picked up by the microphone he wore in a win over the New York Jets last week.\n\n\"Is it good or bad?\" asked Nagy, who had forgotten he was miked up in the first place for a 4 1/2-minute segment posted on the team's website this week.\n\n\"Good? I hope so,\" he said. \"I know there could be some bad stuff on there.\"\n\nNagy generated rave reviews, with the series of clips shedding further light on how the first-year coach has spurred second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky's development as the Bears travel to play the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm going to challenge you right now these two quarters for greatness,\" Nagy told Trubisky on the sideline at halftime. \"You take this thing over right now.\"\n\nTrubisky responded by overseeing three consecutive scoring drives in which the Bears turned a 7-3 lead into a 24-10 win.\n\nHe called the pep-talk inspiring.\n\n\"When he says that, I think it just makes us more goal-oriented,\" Trubisky said. \"I think it really just honed me in, made me focus more.\"\n\nTrubisky has been on a roll.\n\nHis 1,814 yards passing in seven games are 379 yards shy of his total in 12 games last year. He has been especially sharp the past four games with 1,233 yards passing and 13 touchdowns \u2014 the most over that span for Chicago since Sid Luckman in 1947.\n\nCoupled with an opportunistic defense, which ranks second in the NFL with 17 takeaways, the Bears (4-3) are off to their best start in five years.\n\nThe Bills (2-6), by comparison, are off to their worst start since 2010, and coach Sean McDermott has had difficulty coaxing much out of a patchwork offense.\n\nThey haven't scored a touchdown in two games, and managed just 87 points all season.\n\nAnd now Buffalo faces the prospect of starting turnover-prone Nathan Peterman on Sunday, with rookie Josh Allen (sprained throwing elbow) ruled out for a third consecutive week, and Derek Anderson dealing with concussion-related issues.\n\nThis would mark Peterman's second turn at starting this season, and after he went 5 of 18 for 24 yards and two interceptions through two-plus quarters of a 47-3 season-opening loss at Baltimore.\n\n\"I'm thankful for all the opportunities I've been through, all the lessons I've learned, and ready to be better from them,\" said Peterman, who has 10 interceptions in 84 career passing attempts, including a brief playoff appearance. \"I'm going to go out there and do my best to get us a win.\"\n\nPRYOR COMMITMENT\n\nReceiver Terrelle Pryor is in position to make his Bills debut five days since signing with Buffalo, and 10 days after being released by the New York Jets.\n\nAfter saying he felt \"underused\" during his six-game stint in New York, ending with a groin injury, Pryor is confident he make an immediate impact in Buffalo.\n\n\"I expect high things from myself, and I expect high things from the offense,\" he said. \"Just because we lost some games doesn't mean we can't win or can't put things together. I believe.\"\n\nLINING UP\n\nThe Bears have a big hole to fill at right guard after Kyle Long hurt his foot last weekend. Eric Kush or rookie James Daniels, who have split time at left guard, are candidates to fill the job. Another option is Bryan Witzmann, who signed three weeks ago. Witzmann started 13 games last season in Kansas City, where Nagy was the Chiefs' offensive coordinator.\n\nUNCERTAIN HOMECOMING\n\nKhalil Mack's return to Buffalo is up in the air with the Bears star pass rusher's status uncertain due to an injured right ankle. Mack emerged as a star during a four-year career at the University at Buffalo, which was the only Division I school to offer him a scholarship. He went on to be selected fifth overall in the 2014 draft by the Raiders, before Oakland dealt Mack to Chicago before the start of this season.\n\nWILDCAT MEMORIES\n\nNagy wasn't surprised to see Bills running back LeSean McCoy taking a few snaps in the wildcat formation during a 25-6 loss to the Patriots on Monday.\n\n\"He's done that going back to Bishop McDevitt in Pennsylvania in high school,\" Nagy said. \"I got to see him do it.\"\n\nNagy was an Eagles assistant coach when Philadelphia drafted McCoy in 2009.\n\nSTALLED MCCOY\n\nMcCoy declined to speak to reporters after Buffalo's first two practices this week since expressing his frustrations after managing just 13 yards rushing against New England. Though he had a season-best 82 yards receiving, McCoy managed 1 yard on his final 11 carries.\n\nHe has not scored in nine consecutive games dating to last season, since scoring a TD rushing and receiving in a 24-17 win over Miami on Dec. 17.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Seligman in Lake Forest, Illinois, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

So, at the same time automation is eliminating good paying jobs that don\u2019t require much education, our immigration system is making it harder for Americans to get jobs.\n\nAmericans are also legitimately scared that our government can\u2019t stop the massive flow of drugs across our southern border \u2014 particularly fentanyl-laced drugs, which have killed tens of thousands of Americans in recent years \u2014 or the Latin American gangs that traffic the drugs and terrorize American communities.\n\nAmericans are furious that the immigration system that their tax dollars support is incompetent, erodes economic opportunity, and puts their lives at risk.\n\nAnd now Americans see thousands of Central Americans heading toward our border and more caravans forming behind them.

Flacco had his worst game of the season against the Panthers, going 22 for 39 for 192 yards, with one TD pass and two interceptions.\n\nBROWN DELIVERS\n\nNo active player has more catches (94) and yards receiving (1,149) against the Ravens in the regular season than Steelers wideout Antonio Brown.\n\nCovering Brown will serve as a litmus test for Smith, who began the season serving a four-game suspension and hasn't quite gotten his A-game going yet.\n\n\"Every game you're going to go against somebody's best,\" Smith said, \"but when you go against one of the guys they name as top in the league, it's a chance to show what you've got and kind of peg yourself for where you're at.\"\n\nSurprisingly, Brown has only four career TDs against the Ravens.\n\nBURNED BURNS\n\nTime may be running out for Pittsburgh cornerback Artie Burns. The former first-round pick is enduring an uneven season and was benched last week for missing a walkthrough\n\nBurns might have to play out of necessity if Coty Sensabaugh's toe injury continues to linger. Burns shrugged off his issues, but Tomlin offered a stern rebuke of the 23-year-old's tardiness.\n\n\"He was late, and we wanted to be focused with the guys who were wired-in appropriately where they needed to be in the hours leading up to kickoff,\" Tomlin said. \"And so, he suffered the consequences of that.\"\n\nPittsburgh's secondary in general needs to play better than it did in the first meeting, when Flacco passed for 363 yards and two TDs.\n\nHELLO, NOVEMBER\n\nThe Ravens went 1-3 in October, but have cause for optimism because they're 30-12 in November since coach John Harbaugh took over in 2008.\n\n\"Don't jinx it,\" Flacco said when told of the stat.\n\nThen he might not want to know the Ravens are 7-0 at home in November against the AFC North under Harbaugh.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Will Graves in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They controlled the puck most of the opening period, but Connor Hellebuyck kept them at bay, turning back 18 shots in the opening frame.\n\nHellebuyck denied Dadonov on a breakaway and helped the Jets kill a penalty before Perreault struck on the other side, scoring the go-ahead goal on a rebound with 1:26 remaining.\n\n\"We generated a ton of chances,\" Florida coach Bob Boughner said. \"This is what it's been like since the season started. We're still trying to break through and get the offensive production going.\"\n\nYandle tied it with 15:42 left in the second period, firing a slap shot on a 4-on-3 power play.\n\nWith an assist on Yandle's goal, forward Mike Hoffman extended his point streak to eight games, and center Nick Bjugstad had the 100th assist of his career.\n\nThe game was the 24th played in Europe during the regular season and the sixth in Finland.

The Patriots prepare to host the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, Nov. 4. (AP Photo/Adrian Kraus, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers are universally regarded as two of the best quarterbacks of their generation.\n\nBrady has spent the better part of his 19 seasons in the NFL eclipsing virtually every milestone set by his predecessors. Along the way, he's captured every major piece of hardware the league has to offer from multiple MVPs to Super Bowl titles, all while remaining at the top of his game at 41.\n\nRodgers isn't as decorated as Brady, but has been just as celebrated during his 14-year career for a free-wheeling style and an uncanny ability to pull off plays that have been rarely duplicated by his peers.\n\nBetween them, they have five regular-season MVP awards, nine Super Bowl appearances and six Super Bowl rings.\n\nYet when the Patriots host the Packers on Sunday night , it will mark just the second time that the future Hall of Famers have squared off as starting quarterbacks. Rodgers won the first meeting in 2014 in a game in which they combined for 613 passing yards and four touchdowns in Green Bay's five-point victory at Lambeau Field.\n\nRodgers capped that season by winning his second regular-season MVP trophy. Brady went on to hoist his fourth Super Bowl title.\n\nWatching each other's success from afar has bred a deep respect between them. Rodgers for Brady's longevity. Brady for the skillset Rodgers brings to the position.\n\n\"Tom's been at the top of his game for over a decade,\" Rodgers said. \"Obviously, we play a little bit different style of game, but the stuff that he does well is stuff that over my career I've tried to incorporate into my own game.\n\n\"I enjoy competing against great players and obviously Tom is right at the top.\"\n\nIt's similar to how Brady describes Rodgers.\n\n\"What he's done as a quarterback, I think it is inspiring even for me,\" Brady said. \"I watch his game and it makes me want to get out there and practice and improve because I think he's so phenomenal with the way he manages himself in the pocket and his ability to throw the football is unlike anyone probably in the history of the league.\"\n\nThough he wants to play until he's 45, Brady will presumably retire before Rodgers, leaving the 34-year-old time to narrow the gap between them in career numbers.\n\nBut neither is interested in playing the hypothetical game about who the better quarterback is.\n\n\"I don't really try to get into the 'what-if' game,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm fortunate to have been drafted here and sit behind Brett (Favre) for three years. He was obviously drafted late there ... so his chip might have been a little bit bigger than mine starting out his career.\n\n\"There's a lot of pride in that legacy part of your career, and I think him and I both feel the same way about our organizations.\"\n\nBrady also called any similar debate about the greatest quarterback of all-time a fruitless endeavor. Though he knows one name that belongs on his list.\n\n\"It's hard to compare positions and eras. It's impossible to answer,\" Brady said. \"I think Aaron is one of the best ever to play the game. He's got every skill you need to be a great quarterback.\"\n\nHere are some things to watch for in Sunday's game:\n\nMILESTONE WATCH\n\nBrady enters Sunday's game second in NFL history for the most combination passing, rushing and receiving yards in the regular-season and playoffs. Peyton Manning tops the list with 79,978 yards. Brady is next with 79,781.\n\nSAFETY DANCE\n\nThe trade of Ha Ha Clinton-Dix means that the Green Bay Packers are without a five-year starter at safety .\n\nClinton-Dix, who led the team with three interceptions, was the most experienced player at a position that was still mired by inconsistency. Possible replacements include Jermain Whitehead, who missed practice at midweek with a back injury; or Josh Jones, a second-year player who missed time earlier this year with an ankle injury. Veteran cornerback Tramon Williams also has a couple games of experience playing safety while with the Browns a couple years ago. Cornerback Bashaud Breeland appears to be getting healthier from a hamstring injury and might be ready to play. The Packers didn't acquire players at the trade deadline, a sign that general manager Brian Gutekunst might like the depth in the secondary even without Clinton-Dix.\n\nCOMING A LONG WAY\n\nDavante Adams was a rookie the last time these teams played in 2014 at Lambeau Field. That 26-21 win by the Packers was a milestone game for Adams, now Green Bay's No. 1 receiver.\n\nAdams had six catches for 121 yards in the game, taking advantage of more targets after the Patriots elected to blanket then-top wideout Jordy Nelson. Now the roles might be reversed, and Adams could be the player who gets extra attention. If that's the case, it won't be much different from what Adams has faced all year. Adams has had at least 132 yards receiving in each of the last three games.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Genaro Armas in Green Bay, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A handful of talents that have flown under the radar or benefited from the trade deadline will use this week as a jumping off point. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHalfway through the season, fantasy owners should know who to trust on a weekly basis. Draft position is meaningless at this point \u2014 players are either producing or they're not.\n\nFantasy's midpoint also signals some players who have been on the outer edge of a breakthrough. A handful of talents that have flown under the radar or benefited from the trade deadline will use this week as a jumping off point.\n\nSTART: Latavius Murray, RB, Vikings: By now, trusting Dalvin Cook is a fool's errand. The Minnesota ground game hasn't missed Cook as Murray has scored four touchdowns in the last three games and faces a Lions run defense that is 26th in fantasy points allowed per game to opposing running backs. Cook may play but will be limited, whereas Murray makes for a solid RB2 who also happens to average 5.1 yards per carry in his home confines.\n\nSIT: Phillip Rivers, QB, Chargers: The Seahawks are downright selfish when it comes to defending the pass, not only ranking first in fewest fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, but also third in fewest receiving yards allowed. It's certainly a tough call to sit Rivers, who has thrown multiple touchdowns in each game this season, yet the Chargers are on the road and there are better matchups to exploit.\n\nSTART: Courtland Sutton, WR, Broncos: The departure of Demaryius Thomas to the Texans sets up the path for Sutton to become Denver's top wideout. Sutton has yet to be targeted more than six times in a game but expect the big rookie to hit double digits for the first time. Houston does come into the Mile High City with a five-game win streak, but a pass defense that is 19th in yards allowed and has given up 15 touchdowns will be suspect. Sutton has just 17 catches, but eight have been for better than 20 yards. He's a great flex option whose upside will push him into must start territory soon.\n\nSIT: Isaiah Crowell, RB, Jets: In the three games since rushing for 219 yards against the Broncos, Crowell has managed only 94 yards on 37 carries, averaging 2.54 yards per attempt. Facing the Dolphins with the league's worst run defense should be the type of game that perks up Crowell, yet there's little reason to believe he'll snap out of his funk. The rise of Trenton Cannon is starting to close the window opened for Crowell upon the loss of Bilal Powell.\n\nSTART: O.J. Howard, TE, Buccaneers: In the first three games Ryan Fitzpatrick started this season, Howard averaged 20.1 yards per catch while catching 11 of 14 targets. Howard has a chance to put up a huge afternoon feasting on a Panthers defense that is last in fantasy points per game allowed to opposing tight ends. Contending with Mike Evans and DeSean Jackson is more than a handful as is, but the thought of Howard getting favorable matchups and utilizing his speed is why he should be a strong TE1.\n\nSIT: Dak Prescott, QB, Cowboys: The addition of Amari Cooper will help bolster a Dallas passing game that is 29th in yardage, good news for Prescott, who has used his running skills to put together his two best fantasy outings in consecutive weeks. The good times may pause Monday night against a Titans run defense tied for third with only three rushing touchdowns allowed. Don't expect Cooper to make an immediate impact, either.\n\nSTART: Devin Funchess, WR, Panthers: Few receivers put up solid numbers against the Ravens defense, so Funchess and his three receptions for 27 yards last week can be forgiven. Funchess has better prospects this week against a Buccaneers defense 30th in passing yards allowed and last in the league with 20 touchdown passes allowed. Funchess has yet to hit the 100-yard mark this season.\n\nSIT: LeSean McCoy, RB, Bills: It's hard to tell if McCoy's decline is simply a case of a decade of usage finally catching up to him or if the Buffalo offense is that bad. The truth lies somewhere in the middle, but that's no reason for fantasy players to wheel out McCoy against a Bears run defense that is third in yards allowed and remains the league's only team to not allow a rushing touchdown. McCoy will get his share of touches, but bad touches become worse touches as the numbers climb.\n\nSTART: Joe Flacco, QB, Ravens: Coming off his worst outing of the season, Flacco gets a great rebound opportunity against a Steelers team that he carved up for 363 yards and two touchdowns in Week 4. Pittsburgh is 16th in net passing yards allowed but has allowed 17 touchdowns. The Steelers have also given up 29 completions of 20 or more yards.\n\nSIT: Aaron Jones, RB, Packers: Green Bay's dependence on the pass and a timeshare with Jamaal Williams makes Jones a risky play despite the potential of a Sunday night slugfest against the Patriots. Jones ran for 86 yards on just 12 carries last week against the Rams and would be a high-end RB2 if fantasy owners knew he would get 18-20 touches.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 9 fantasy advice and insights, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Replacement Brock Osweiler has gone 1-2 as the starter but has played well, providing fresh fodder for Tannehill's many critics.\n\nGase dismissed those detractors in the media and elsewhere who argue it's time for Miami (4-4) to find another quarterback.\n\n\"What qualifications are we talking about with the people saying that? None,\" Gase said. \"So I don't really care what anybody else thinks.\"\n\nTannehill, 30, became Miami's starter as a rookie in 2012 and still hasn't won a playoff game.

De Bruyne attempted to play on, but slumped to the ground moments later and then walked off in the 86th minute.\n\n\"He is being checked by the doctors,\" City manager Pep Guardiola said. Asked if he was worried about the injury, Guardiola said, \"I don't know right now.\"\n\nWith most of City's star players given the night off, one of its brightest young talents took his opportunity to impress in a routine win over an opponent that has now lost five straight games in all competitions and has just one win in 10 games in the Premier League this season.\n\nBrahim Diaz, a 19-year-old Spanish forward, scored a goal in each half at Etihad Stadium and was given a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 78th after making only his second competitive start of the season.\n\nBritish newspapers reported this week that Diaz was likely to leave City next year over his frustration at a lack of playing time since moving from Malaga in 2016, and Guardiola said he understood the situation.\n\n\"They know how we want to protect them,\" Guardiola said of Diaz and other highly regarded young players. \"They know how we tried to help them in the particular way we want to play.\n\n\"We want him.

Ten of those 11 came when he was with the Cleveland Browns. He's only lost to the Ravens once with the Steelers, 26-14 in Week 4 of this season.\n\nThat one felt different. So will the game Sunday, where the Steelers secondary will look to take another step in a third straight game against an AFC North rival.\n\n\"I think being here and (in Cleveland), (the Steelers are) at the top of the division most of the time, seeing who can win it and fighting for the division winner,\" Haden said.\n\n\"So I think that's just a little different toward the end of the season, knowing these games (against Baltimore) could be big when we get to the end, determining who can get to the playoffs.\"\n\nThe secondary could obviously be better than it was in the previous matchup, Haden said. Defensive coordinator Keith Butler agreed.\n\nRavens quarterback Joe Flacco threw for 363 yards and two touchdowns against a Steelers secondary that allowed an average of 305 passing yards through its first four games.\n\n\"We have to make sure, as much as we can, that we keep the ball in front of us,\" Butler said. \"We can't give up easy touchdowns. Teams go up, we have to make them go up by (field goals) and not let them go up by seven, if we can.\"\n\nRavens wide receiver John Brown had 116 yards and one touchdown on just three receptions in the first matchup against Pittsburgh. Haden knows that can't happen again.\n\n\"He's a small dude, obviously. He's small, really fast,\" Haden said. \"You have to make sure you keep him in front of you. He can really beat you. ... He had those two deep balls on us, so we have to contain that.\"\n\nIf Pittsburgh's past three games are any indication, the defensive backs might have a better chance against Brown this time.\n\nAtlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones was held without a catch until the fourth quarter of a 41-17 loss to the Steelers in Week 5, when he had a season-low 62 yards. The following week, A.J. Green caught seven of his 12 targets for 85 yards in a 28-21 Cincinnati Bengals loss to Pittsburgh.\n\nBrowns wide receiver Jarvis Landry had 39 yards on eight receptions in the Steelers' 33-18 win last Sunday.\n\nHaden matched up against each of those three. He wouldn't say who would be responsible for Brown from Pittsburgh's secondary, which is expected to have cornerback Artie Burns in the mix after using him exclusively on special teams against Cleveland.\n\nBurns was disciplined after arriving late to a team walkthrough Saturday.\n\nCornerback Mike Hilton, whom Haden called one of the Steelers' best players, said no matter who is called upon, limiting Brown is a must for Pittsburgh.\n\nAfter missing the first matchup with an elbow injury, Hilton also said he has a plan for Sunday.\n\n\"There were certain things I did see,\" Hilton said. \"I feel like I'll be able to, I'm not going to say make every play, but help control the outcome of that play.

This, in turn, appears to cause more wild and extreme summertime weather for us Earthlings \u2013 and could increase in the decades ahead.\n\nIn summer 2018, for instance, impacts on extreme weather due to the weird behavior of jet stream winds were felt worldwide, according to study lead author Michael Mann of Penn State University.\n\n\"It played out in real time on our television screens and newspaper headlines in the form of an unprecedented hemisphere-wide pattern of extreme floods, droughts, heat waves and wildfires,\" Mann said.\n\nWhat's happening, on a very basic level, is that unusual warmth in the Arctic causes jet streams \u2013 the rivers of air in the atmosphere that push and pull our weather around \u2013 to slow down, stall or meander in strange ways. When the undulations of the jet stream lock in place, weather systems can be trapped and cause havoc down here.\n\n\"If the same weather persists for weeks on end in one region, then sunny days can turn into a serious heat wave and drought, and lasting rains can lead to flooding,\" said study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\nThe extreme and unusual jet stream patterns \u2013 known technically as \"quasi-resonant amplification\" \u2013 could increase by as much as 50 percent by 2100, the study said.\n\nA wild card in this theory is that another human-caused ingredient \u2013 air pollution \u2013 could actually counteract the impact of global warming on our atmosphere.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Games in the second week of the preseason are mostly meaningless and usually a forgettable exercise for veterans.\n\nSeattle linebacker Bobby Wagner hasn't forgotten what happened this past August when the Seahawks were facing the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nIt was late in the first quarter when Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers decided to take a timeout because he didn't like the play against Seattle's defensive alignment. But the part that Wagner remembers: Rivers knew the exact name of Seattle's defensive call.\n\n\"He called timeout and was like, 'Dang, they're running strong something,' and I'm like we just changed the name yesterday, how'd you do that?\" Wagner recalled. \"Maybe he just luckily chose that, I don't know. It was kind of funny, I'm like how did he know the name? The quarterbacks know the play, they never know the name of the play.\"\n\nKnowing the play didn't really matter back in August, but it will Sunday when the surging Chargers face the equally improving Seahawks. Los Angeles (5-2) has won four straight and is coming off a bye week following its 20-19 win over Tennessee in London. The Seahawks (4-3) have won four of five \u2014 including a victory in London \u2014 and the game against the Chargers starts a stretch with six of the final nine games at home for Seattle.\n\nAnd Rivers is the introduction to a challenging month of elite quarterbacks the Seahawks will face and challenge Seattle's overhauled defense that has climbed its way back to being among the best in the NFL halfway through the season. After Rivers, the Seahawks will face Jared Goff, Aaron Rodgers and Cam Newton in consecutive weeks.\n\n\"The biggest difference is you used to go in \u2014 and this is not by any means slighting the roster, the defensive lineup now \u2014 but you used to go into that game, and you could just say, who is on Seattle's defense, and you could write out every one right because they had been together for so long, back-to-back Super Bowls, won the Super Bowl against Denver,\" Rivers said. \"Now there's just been so much change on that defense, but there's still the same scheme, and there's plenty of names that you can recognize. So it's a good group.\"\n\nThe Chargers should get running back Melvin Gordon back after he missed the win in London with a hamstring injury. Gordon has combined with fellow running back Austin Ekeler to have 1,283 yards from scrimmage and the pair is averaging 6.65 yards per touch.\n\nSeattle's running backs are providing and equally important contribution to the Seahawks recent success. Chris Carson has become Seattle's primary runner and posted his third 100-yard game in last week's win over Detroit. Beginning with Week 3, only the Los Angeles Rams have more carries or yards rushing than the Seahawks \u2014 and Los Angeles has played one more game.\n\n\"I think they know what's working. That's kind of their formula,\" Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said. \"They have been averaging about 30 rush attempts a game and it's working.\"\n\nHere's what else to watch as the former AFC West foes meet for the 51st time overall:\n\n200 STRAIGHT FOR RIVERS\n\nRivers will make his 200th consecutive regular-season start. He'll be the fourth quarterback and the eighth player since the merger to reach that milestone. The 15-year veteran is off to one of the best starts of his career. He's second in the league with a 117.8 passer rating and tied for third in touchdowns with 17.\n\n\"Obviously, you want to be able to out there and help. It's not just be out there. You want to play at a high level, and that's been up and down over 199, but being out there means something,\" Rivers said.\n\nTHE OTHER QB\n\nWhile much of the focus has been on the quarterbacks Seattle is about to face, the Seahawks' own QB is playing pretty well.\n\nRussell Wilson posted the first perfect passer rating in Seahawks history last week against Detroit when he completed 14 of 17 passes for 248 yards and three touchdowns. With the focus on the run game, Wilson's task passing has become efficiency and taking advantage when opportunities are presented. In the past three games, Wilson has nine TD passes on just 61 pass attempts.\n\nBIG PLAY WILLIAMS\n\nWith most opposing defenses continuing to double-team Keenan Allen, Chargers WR Tyrell Williams has emerged as a big-play threat. Six of his 10 receptions in the past three games have been for 26 yards or more and three have gone for touchdowns. According to Sportradar, four of those receptions have been on go routes with the other two being post routes.\n\nHEAVY HEARTS\n\nSunday will be the first home game for the Seahawks since the death of owner Paul Allen, who died on Oct. 15. He was 65. Allen was responsible for purchasing the team and keeping the Seahawks in Seattle, along with the construction of CenturyLink Field.\n\nSeattle's first coach, Jack Patera, also passed away earlier this week at age 85.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Josef Martinez knew he was receiving one of Major League Soccer's top awards.\n\nThe Atlanta United star was caught off guard by the presenter.\n\nAfter the greatest goal-scoring season in MLS history, the Venezuelan striker got a surprise when countryman and Atlanta Braves outfielder Ender Inciarte showed up Thursday at United's training facility to hand out the Golden Boot.\n\nInciarte said Martinez's 31-goal season , which shattered the league's previous scoring record, provided a much-needed bit of good news to their troubled homeland.\n\n\"I love the things he's been able to accomplish not only for Atlanta, but also for Venezuela,\" said Inciarte, who donned United's red-and-black, five-striped jersey for the ceremony and also got a tour of the team's training facility. \"A lot of people in Venezuela are going through a lot. Having somebody doing great things, the way he's been doing, it's a sign of hope for them.\"\n\nMartinez broke the previous MLS record of 27 goals, which was shared by Roy Lassiter, Chris Wondolowski and Bradley Wright-Phillips, leading United to a second-place finish in the Eastern Conference and its second straight playoff appearance.\n\nAtlanta will begin a two-legged conference semifinal series against New York City FC on Sunday at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe 25-year-old Martinez was clearly pleased with his first Golden Boot, but he's more focused on bringing another trophy to Atlanta.\n\nThe MLS Cup.\n\n\"There's still a lot to accomplish this season,\" Martinez said through an interpreter. \"That's why we're here: to win things. If it's as a team, that's even better, because that's what's important.\"\n\nMartinez formerly played with Torino in Italy's Serie A, but he struggled as a winger and scored just seven goals in 58 league games.\n\nAcquired by Atlanta for its inaugural 2017 season, he moved to a more natural position in front of the net and responded with 19 goals in 20 games. If not for missing more than two months with a quadriceps injury sustained in an international match with Venezuela, he might've broken the scoring record a year ago.\n\nThis season, Martinez improved his skills away from the ball and showed an ability to score with either foot and especially his head, even though he's generously listed at just 5-foot-7.\n\nHe said his most memorable goal was No. 28, the record breaker against Orlando. Julian Gressel delivered a pass to Martinez, who quickly flicked the ball ahead and gave a shoulder-dipping deke that sent a defender flying past him and put keeper Joe Bendik on his backside. Martinez turned the ball back inside off his left foot and calmly flicked it over Bendik with his right to clinch a 2-1 victory.\n\nMartinez, who is also a finalist for the league's MVP award, endured a four-game scoring drought late in the season, finally breaking through with a penalty kick in the finale at Toronto. It was the only highlight in a 4-1 loss that cost United its first major trophy. New York Red Bulls won their final game and edged out Atlanta by two points for the Supporters' Shield that goes to the team with top regular-season record.\n\nCoach Tata Martino, who was instrumental in putting Martinez in an attacking system where he could flourish, has announced he will leave United at the end of the playoffs , reportedly to take over as Mexico's national team coach.\n\n\"He's the one who opened the door for me to come to Atlanta,\" Martinez said. \"We have a great relationship on and off the field. Usually, when I talk about our relationship, I'm not talking about soccer. I'm talking about other things in life. We just have to take advantage of him while he's here.\"\n\nMartino's impending departure has led to speculation that Martinez may be looking to get out as well, perhaps for another shot in Europe.\n\n\"He's definitely someone who has left his footprint on Atlanta,\" Martinez said. \"But now we have two really important games that we're focusing on. We'll see what happens in the future.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

(AP) \u2014 The Carolina Panthers have stability at the quarterback position. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are desperately in search of the same.\n\nThe teams appear headed in different directions entering an NFC South showdown Sunday in Charlotte \u2014 and quarterback play is a big reason why.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick replaces Jameis Winston, who was benched after committing 11 turnovers in his last 3 \u00bd games for the Buccaneers (3-4).

Right now, we just have to stop turning the ball over and so we're going to go with Fitz.\"\n\nPanthers coach Ron Rivera has never benched his franchise quarterback Cam Newton because of his performance.\n\nAnd he's not about to this year.\n\nThe Panthers (5-2) enter the game looking for their 10th straight home win behind Newton, who is playing his best football since earning league MVP honors in 2015 and leading Carolina to the Super Bowl. Newton has 17 combined touchdowns. He's thrown only four interceptions all season \u2014 the same amount Winston threw in last week's loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nRivera said he realizes how lucky he is to have Newton at the helm.\n\n\"It shows you how important it is to have a franchise quarterback and have the position stabilized,\" Rivera said.\n\nPROLIFIC OFFENSE\n\nDespite the quarterback change, the Bucs are still first in the NFL in passing and total offense. They've thrown for 2,634 yards \u2014 the second-highest total through the first seven games of a season in NFL history behind the 2000 St. Louis Rams (2,637). They have 19 touchdown passes, third-most in the league behind Kansas City (26) and Indianapolis (23).\n\nKoetter concedes the Bucs, who are 28th in rushing at 91.3 yards per game, have evolved into a pass-first team.\n\nPanthers safety Eric Reid said Carolina is preparing the same way regardless of who is under center, noting that both QBs like to throw the ball deep.\n\n\"Their offense runs the same with both guys,\" Reid said.\n\nNEWTON'S SHOULDER\n\nRivera didn't appear concerned about Newton's right shoulder, even though the eighth-year QB has been limited in practice the last two weeks. In fact, Newton declined last week to throw a Hail Mary pass just before halftime, telling the coaches he didn't feel comfortable doing that. That might explain, in part, why Newton hasn't attempted many passes down the field this season.\n\nHowever, Koetter said he doesn't see anything wrong with Newton's arm strength.\n\n\"Man if he's got a sore arm, I'd hate to see the real deal,\" Koetter said. \"Cam has always had a cannon. He can stand flat-footed and put that thing on a line. I've been in this division a long time, and arm strength is probably about the 159th thing on the list that you'd be worried about with Cam.\"\n\nPROTECTING CAM\n\nThe Bucs will make it a priority pressure Newton, but that hasn't proven easy to do this season.\n\nNewton has been sacked a league-low 10 times because he's getting the ball out quicker playing in new coordinator Norv Turner's scheme and the patchwork offensive line is \"protecting Cam better than he ever has been before,\" Rivera said.\n\nNewton said while a lot of people think Carolina's offensive line is made up of \"misfits and undesirables,\" he added \"those guys have been playing lights out.\"\n\nFAST START\n\nDefensive end Jason Pierre-Paul has a sack in a Bucs franchise-record six consecutive games. With eight of the team's 16 sacks through seven games, he's nearly halfway to the career-best 16 \u00bd he had for the New York Giants when he was an All-Pro in 2011. Tampa Bay, which acquired Pierre-Paul in an offseason trade, hasn't had a player finish with 10 or more sacks since Simeon Rice in 2005.\n\n\"I am so excited about what Jason's brought to us,\" defensive coordinator Mark Duffner said. \"He practices hard, he prepares hard. This guy is on a mission and it's been beautiful to see and be around.\"\n\nMORE OF MOORE\n\nThe Buccaneers can expect to see a heavy dose of speedy rookie wide receiver D.J. Moore. With Torrey Smith out with a knee injury last week against Baltimore, Moore took advantage of his increased playing time and led the Panthers with 90 yards receiving and added 39 yards rushing on two carries. Smith is out this Sunday, too.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Fred Goodall in Tampa, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Jaguars coach Doug Marrone is shouldering the blame for the team\u2019s four-game losing streak. (AP Photo/Tim Ireland, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Marrone is shouldering the blame for the team's four-game losing streak, saying he \"hasn't done a good enough job for whatever reason to get everyone's mind in the right place.\"\n\nMarrone insists he's not trying to be a \"martyr, a shield or anything like that.\"\n\nTruth is he's protecting everyone: top executive Tom Coughlin, general manager Dave Caldwell, inconsistent quarterback Blake Bortles , unavailable running back Leonard Fournette and dozens more underperforming players on an underachieving team.\n\nThe Jaguars (3-5) have been one of the NFL's biggest busts in 2018, especially last month when they went 0-for-October and looked nothing like the team that advanced to the AFC championship game nine months earlier.\n\n\"There is a story out there about this team. It is an ugly story,\" said Marrone, who is counting on his team to regroup during its Week 9 bye.\n\n\"But the story hasn't ended. We can still control how this story reads. When we get away, we have to think long and hard about it. We have to come back and we have to figure out what the story is going to be on the 2018 team.\"\n\nInjuries are a big reason for the slide, especially with Fournette \u2014 the team's offensive centerpiece \u2014 missing six games because of a strained right hamstring. But Coughlin, Caldwell and Bortles deserve criticism.\n\nCoughlin designed an old-school team to play in a pass-happy league, one in which running the ball is barely important and hiding a mediocre quarterback is next to impossible. The ground-and-pound Jags want to control the clock, limit Bortles' throws and play stout defense. It can work, but it usually needs everything to go right.\n\nTurnovers, dropped passes, defensive lapses, the Jaguars have seen those too often and aren't built to handle much adversity or overcome double-digit deficits.\n\nIt doesn't help that Jacksonville is getting so little from its rookie class and its free-agent crop.\n\nCoughlin and Caldwell were so confident they had a playoff team in place that they used the draft to prepare for 2019, adding several down-the-road replacements for veteran starters. First-round pick and defensive lineman Taven Bryan has nine tackles in eight games. Second-round receiver DJ Chark has 12 catches for 159 yards to go along with a fumble and several costly drops. Third-round safety Ronnie Harrison has been the best of the bunch while playing mostly in certain defensive packages.\n\nRight tackle Will Richardson (fourth) is on injured reserve. Quarterback Tanner Lee (fifth) remains on the practice squad. Linebacker Leon Jacobs (sixth) has barely played outside special teams. And punter Logan Cooke (seventh) has failed repeatedly to flip the field when needed.\n\nFree agents Andrew Norwell, Donte Moncrief, D.J. Hayden, Austin Seferian-Jenkins and Marqise Lee have been equally disappointing.\n\nNorwell, a 2017 All-Pro guard from Carolina, was expected to bolster the offensive line and help give the Jaguars one of the best running attacks in the league. Instead, he looks unworthy of his five-year, $66.5 million contract.\n\nMoncrief, who signed a one-year deal worth $9.6 million, was supposed to offset the loss of physical receiver Allen Robinson. He has 29 catches for 379 yards and two scores.\n\nHayden (toe) has missed six consecutive games, and Seferian-Jenkins (core muscle) and Lee (knee) are on injured reserve.\n\n\"Playing football is easy,\" defensive tackle Malik Jackson said. \"Staying healthy is the hard part.\"\n\nA legitimate franchise quarterback might be able to make up for all of Jacksonville's deficiencies. But Coughlin and Caldwell decided to give Bortles a three-year, $54 million contract in February, betting that the fifth-year starter would continue developing and adding to a growing list of turnover-free games.\n\nNeither has happened, and the Jaguars are seemingly stuck with Bortles because of his $21 million contract in 2019. He has 10 touchdown passes, eight interceptions and three lost fumbles to go along with 18 sacks.\n\nThrow in a training camp fight, two weeklong suspensions, a locker room scuffle last month, four players getting detained in London because of an unsettled nightclub tab, Jalen Ramsey's mouth and the ultra-confident defense failing to maintain its 2017 form, and the Jaguars have been more of a farce than a force in the AFC.\n\n\"The most important thing as a team is we've got to keep our belief strong,\" defensive end Calais Campbell said. \"No matter what the outside noise says or does, we just got to keep our belief strong. Five losses in this league this early sucks, but five losses throughout the season, that's not bad at all; that's a heck of a year.\n\n\"We've got a lot of ball left to play. We made it real hard on ourselves, but I truly believe the guys that we have here are built to be able to do something special, even considering our current circumstance.\"\n\nMarrone hopes to get Fournette, Hayden and cornerback A.J. Bouye (calf) back after the bye week. He also wouldn't rule out staff and lineup changes.\n\nAlready saddled with two division losses at home, the Jaguars have little room for error after the break if they're able to write a feel-good ending to their \"ugly story.\"\n\n\"When no one picks you to win and everyone thinks you are going to stink, it's, 'Let's go out there and prove everybody wrong and play with a chip on our shoulder and go,'\" Marrone said. \"Then all of a sudden, when everybody is on the bandwagon, it's the opposite. 'Let's prove everybody right.' Either way, you are trying to prove right or wrong what is going on.\n\n\"We just haven't lived up to the expectations to this day.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Amy Kontras, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nJoey Logano corrected himself nearly as quickly as he righted his car to secure both the win at Martinsville Speedway and a berth in the Championship 4 last Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe pressure for those two races is off,\u201d Logano told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cMaybe, \u2018the pressure is off\u2019 is the wrong thing to say.

The three other slots will be up for grabs over the next two races, the first coming Sunday at the AAA Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway (3 p.m. ET, NBCSN).\n\nLogano bumped reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr. coming toward the checkered flag after the pair raced side-by-side on the previous lap. The collision spun out Truex's No. 78 Toyota, but Logano was able to keep his No. 22 Team Penske Ford under control enough for his first Martinsville win, second of the season and 20th of his Cup Career.\n\nTruex, who finished third behind Denny Hamlin, called the bump that knocked him out of the lead a \u201ccheap shot\u201d after the race.\n\n\u201cThat was the classic bump-and-run,\u201d Logano said after the race. \u201cThat was the move that our sport and Martinsville in particular was built on. I think I owe it to my race team to do everything I can to win a race, get another shot at winning a championship. That's my job.\u201d\n\nLogano, 28, has now made the Championship 4 three times, although he was nowhere near it last year. He finished 17th in the standings and failed to make the playoffs when he was penalized after his lone 2017 victory \u2014 in the spring race at Richmond Raceway \u2014 was ruled ineligible for playoff consideration.\n\n\u201cThe recovery really started at the end of last season and continued as this season kicked off,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI think we got locked into one way of doing things that worked in the past and we really didn\u2019t want to change. That put us behind the learning curve.\u201d\n\nSunday's race at Texas Motor Speedway is a return to the 1\u00bd-mile ovals that make up the bulk of the schedule, and the racing is likely to be much different than the tight, close-quarter style that Martinsville has become famous for.\n\nSeven other drivers \u2014 Kyle Busch, Truex, Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch, Chase Elliott, Clint Bowyer and Aric Almirola \u2014 have an opportunity Sunday and the following week at the Can-Am 500 at ISM Raceway near Phoenix to secure a final four berth.\n\nMORE: Truex out to prove lame-duck team can win a title\n\nKyle Busch, who currently has the points lead in the playoff standings, won the spring race at Texas in early April, edging Harvick at the finish line. The roles were reversed on month earlier in Phoenix, when Harvick topped Busch during the spring race at ISM Raceway. Harvick also won last year's playoff race at Texas after Truex led a race-high 107 laps.\n\nAll three drivers \u2014 who also hold the top three spots in the playoff standings \u2014 are likely to be huge factors again this weekend, but the track remains unpredictable after the surface was repaved and the banking was lowered in turns 1 and 2 before the 2017 spring race.\n\nBusch said the repave hasn't posed any problems for him, but he is looking forward to the surface getting more \"racey\" with time.\n\n\"That place has always been fast, and it\u2019s always been one-groovish around the bottom, and so far it\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve got with the repave,\" Busch said last weekend at Martinsville. \"It was a good place for us before the repave, and now since the repave, I think it\u2019s been a pretty good place for us as well.\"", "FILE- In this Sunday, Oct. 14, 2018, file photo, Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan (2) looks to pass against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the first half of an NFL football game in Atlanta. Ryan leads the NFL with 333.6 yards a game with the benefit of a receiving corps of Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu and rookie Calvin Ridley. (AP Photo/John Bazemore, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 All games and no practice reps make Alex Smith a dull quarterback.\n\nInjuries to receivers Jamison Crowder and Paul Richardson and running backs Adrian Peterson and Chris Thompson have kept them from getting work in with Smith at practice and stunted the Washington Redskins' passing game so far this season. The NFC East-leading Redskins have run all over opponents with a banged-up Peterson, boasted a much-improved defense and is only missing the kind of effective passing game they'll see Sunday when they host Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons.\n\n\"I think the success for a lot of NFL teams is if you can stop the run, and you can run the ball and control the clock, you've got a chance to win some games. We've been able to do all three,\" Thompson said. \"The passing game has been up and down. It's been slow. We've been without our full group of receivers for a little bit of time. ... We just have to find a way to do a better job.\"\n\nSmith and the Redskins (5-2) have averaged 212.7 yards in the air, and only three teams have fewer passing touchdowns than their eight. They won't have Crowder again this week as he'll miss his fourth consecutive game with an ankle injury.\n\nAtlanta (3-4) has been battered by injuries to both starting guards and safeties, running back Devonta Freeman and linebacker Deion Jones and as a result hasn't lived up to preseason expectations. Ryan has held up his end of the bargain with 15 touchdowns and two interceptions and leads the NFL with 333.6 yards a game with the benefit of a receiving corps of Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu and rookie Calvin Ridley.\n\n\"He's obviously done a tremendous job of reading defenses and putting a lot of different guys in advantageous situations,\" tight end Austin Hooper said. \"That's just a credit to the work Matt's put in all year. If he keeps it going, good things will come.\"\n\nThat's also the Redskins' message to Smith, who also has thrown only two picks and been solid at managing the ball even if the yards haven't piled up. Smith doesn't believe he has been too cautious, but acknowledges the passing game has to be far more effective in certain areas.\n\n\"The ones that stand out though are the situational stuff, the third downs that you don't convert because they would have given you a whole other rack of opportunities,\" Smith said. \"The red zone, obviously because it's so vital. I think the situational stuff always tends to jump out when you don't execute, because of its magnitude.\"\n\nWashington is 22nd in the league on third down and 25th in the red zone. Those particular failings speak to Smith still needing to get in sync with tight end Jordan Reed, Crowder, Richardson and Josh Doctson in his first year with the Redskins.\n\nWith so many missed opportunities at practice because of injuries, Smith said one of the biggest hurdles is he and receivers reading the same coverage from a defense and being on the same page.\n\n\"There is really a premium on both the receiver and quarterbacks seeing the same thing and reacting to it the same way, and I think that's the hard part,\" Smith said. \"There are times when it is cut and dried, when it's pure zone and we're spacing the field and timing routes and there are times when it's purely man and you just beat him. But a lot of times, it's a blend of the two and I think you've got to see the same thing, react to it the same way.\"\n\nSome things to watch when the Falcons visit the Redskins:\n\nPETERSON TIME\n\nBlips in the passing game have made it all the more valuable that Peterson is still running strong at 33. Peterson has rushed for 587 yards and four touchdowns through seven games and is the most important piece of Washington's offense.\n\n\"He's playing so well right now, when we call a running play, he better be out there,\" coach Jay Gruden said. \"I expect him to be a major part of our offense moving forward. He has to be right now, the way we are throwing the ball.\"\n\nJULIO HISTORY\n\nJones needs 134 yards receiving in his 102nd career game to become the fastest to 10,000. He's averaging 116 yards a game as part of a deep group of Falcons receivers the Redskins are concerned about.\n\n\"They get open, they separate, they go up and get the ball,\" Washington linebacker Zach Brown said. \"It's just hard to have corners to deal with that.\"\n\nCLINTON-DIX DEBUT\n\nWhile the Falcons stood pat at Tuesday's trade deadline, the Redskins acquired safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix from Green Bay for a fourth-round pick. The combination of Clinton-Dix and D.J. Swearinger, who had two interceptions last week against the Giants, gives Washington arguably the best duo of safeties in the league.\n\n\"I came here to play,\" Clinton-Dix said. \"I came here to work. Even if that's on special teams, I'm just helping contribute to this team any way I can, because No. 20 is going to be suited up this weekend, and you can bet that.\"\n\nROAD WOES\n\nPart of Atlanta's rough road so far this season has been an 0-2 record on the road with a close loss at Philadelphia and a blowout one at Pittsburgh. The same offense that has put up over 32 points a game at home has managed just over two touchdowns on the road.\n\n\"The biggest issue is cadence, or the lack thereof, in the ability to hear,\" Hooper said. \"It's just in understanding the subtle, nonverbal signals that allow you to play fast.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer George Henry in Flowery Branch, Georgia, contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The alleged crime coincided with a Chinese state-owned company working to develop a comparable engine, the department said.\n\nThat case followed an Oct. 10 announcement that a Chinese intelligence officer was extradited to Ohio to face charges of attempting to steal trade secrets related to aircraft engines.

(AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 When the New York Jets run the ball Sunday, it will be a test of their blocking against the Miami Dolphins' tackling to see who's worse.\n\nBoth have been bad lately.\n\nMiami (4-4) has given up 600 yards rushing in the past three games. A defensive decline, not an injury to quarterback Ryan Tannehill , is the biggest reason the Dolphins have lost four of their past five games.\n\n\"We've got to be better,\" safety Reshad Jones said. \"But there's no time to hit the panic button right now. We've got a lot of football left.\"\n\nThe Jets (3-5) have averaged 2.8 yards per carry in the past three games while totaling 235 yards. After running back Bilal Powell suffered a season-ending neck injury in Week 7, the ground game generated just 57 yards in last week's loss at the Chicago Bears.\n\n\"I didn't think it was good at all,\" coach Todd Bowles said. \"They beat us up front, and they beat us to the punch.\"\n\nSo it looks like an even matchup: the resistible force against the moveable object.\n\nHere are things to know about the 106th meeting between two AFC East rivals sporting two-game losing streaks:\n\nTURF WAR\n\nThe Dolphins are tied for 29th in the NFL in run defense. In the past three weeks, they've allowed 164, 248 and 188 yards on the ground, with big plays the biggest problem.\n\n\"There is no secret. There is no magic pill,\" five-time Pro Bowl defensive end Cameron Wake said. \"Each player has a gap or a man or a zone. You can do it right for 42 plays, and then on play 43 you're not there, and in this league they'll find that hole. They'll find that guy who's not doing their thing that they're supposed to be doing. And 80 yards later ...\"\n\nThe Jets' recent rushing woes come after they gashed Denver in Week 5 for 323 yards, second-most in franchise history. Isaiah Crowell had a team-record 219 in that game, but in the past three weeks he has totaled just 94 yards in 37 carries.\n\nThe sputtering ground attack only increases the burden on rookie quarterback Sam Darnold .\n\n\"We can't be up and down,\" Bowles said. \"We've got to be consistent at it. If we want to throw the ball consistently, we've got to be able to run it consistently.\"\n\nSUBSTITUTE\n\nTannehill will miss his fourth game in a row because of an injury to his throwing shoulder. Replacement Brock Osweiler has a slightly better passer rating than Tannehill, with six touchdown throws and three interceptions in three games.\n\nOsweiler passed for 241 yards in last week's 42-23 loss at Houston and said he's trying to play so well he doesn't go back to the bench.\n\n\"I had a laundry list of things after the Houston game that I want to clean up,\" he said. \"It was really about one page of notes. We have a great coaching staff, and they took that page of notes and turned that into drills \u2014 things I didn't do right in the game \u2014 in hopes that we can correct those mistakes and make sure that they never happen again.\"\n\nCATCH, IF YOU CAN\n\nThe Jets could be shorthanded again at receiver as Robby Anderson and Quincy Enunwa, Darnold's top targets, are dealing with ankle injuries.\n\nAnderson missed the game at Chicago, and Enunwa has been sidelined the past two games. Without both, New York struggled to get the passing game going against the Bears. Rookie Deontay Burnett, a former teammate of Darnold's at USC, led the Jets with four catches for 61 yards.\n\n\"You hate to see Robby go down and Q go down, but that means someone's got to step up,\" Darnold said. \"It was cool for him to be able to step up the way that he did.\"\n\nFINDING THE END ZONE\n\nRookie tight end Chris Herndon is making catching touchdown passes a weekly thing.\n\nThe fourth-round draft pick out of the University of Miami has scored in each of the past three games, joining receiver Keyshawn Johnson (1996) and tight end Thurlow Cooper (1960) as the only rookies in franchise history to accomplish the feat.\n\nHerndon is also tied with Philadelphia's Dallas Goedert for the most touchdowns among rookie NFL tight ends with three.\n\nDEJA VU\n\nThe Jets are in a familiar spot at the halfway point, sitting at 3-5 after eight games for the third consecutive year.\n\nThey're hoping to finish better than they have the last two years, when they ended up 5-11.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dennis Waszak in Florham Park, New Jersey, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Two years ago, the pair squared off in college and combined for more than 1,700 yards. ( (AP Photo/Don Wright, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Back when their chances of playing quarterback in the NFL were still in the dream stages, Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield sat in an apartment near Texas Tech's campus and played video games.\n\nIt was 2013.\n\nThree years later, they appeared to do the same thing on the field.\n\n\"It was a basketball score,\" Mayfield recalled.\n\n\"That game was crazy,\" Mahomes said, remembering the October night in 2016 when he and Mayfield re-wrote the NCAA record book.\n\nThe quarterbacks and friends will renew their old rivalry \u2014 and perhaps embark on a new one as pros \u2014 Sunday when Mahomes leads Kansas City and the Chiefs' high-flying, high-octane offense, into Cleveland to play Mayfield and the Browns, who are again in disarray following the firings this week of coach Hue Jackson and coordinator Todd Haley.\n\nThe previous time they met between the hash marks, Mahomes and Mayfield put on a stunning statistical show unlike anything college football had seen before.\n\nThey combined for 12 touchdown passes, 1,279 yards passing and broke the total yardage mark with 1,708 yards \u2014 854 for each school.\n\nLooking back, Mayfield, who threw seven TD passes to Mahomes' five and led the Sooners to a 66-59 win, still can't fathom what happened.\n\n\"That was my 'Welcome back to Lubbock' moment,\" said Mayfield, who began his college career as a walk-on at Texas Tech before transferring.\n\n\"Weird things happen in Lubbock, Texas, on Saturday nights. It is pretty funny, Oklahoma goes back to Lubbock this weekend and then I am playing Pat on Sunday.\"\n\nBrowns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who has replaced Jackson as Cleveland's interim coach, shook his head in disbelief when given details of the Mahomes-Mayfield shootout.\n\n\"Oh, my gosh,\" he said. \"Setting defenses back a thousand years.\"\n\nNo one \u2014 not even the quarterbacks themselves \u2014 could have envisioned their first meeting five years ago when Mayfield hosted Mahomes on his recruiting trip to Texas Tech would blossom into a friendship and maybe the NFL's next great QB duel.\n\nMayfield was aware of Mahomes' background and talent \u2014 son of a major league baseball player, bazooka-like arm \u2014 but then got to know him personally during that weekend visit. What Mayfield quickly learned was that, like him, Mahomes is a natural leader.\n\n\"Patrick has always been an easygoing guy,\" Mayfield said. \"That is why those teammates he has always had play for him so hard. He gets their respect not just based on talent \u2014 that's easy to respect \u2014 but based on who he is as a person. He just has that presence about him that you want to be around. You gravitate towards that so it is fun to see him grow.\"\n\nAnd my, has Mahomes grown.\n\nThe 22-year-old leads the league with 26 TD passes and 2,526 yards. He threw six TD passes in Week 2 against Pittsburgh, and Mahomes has made as many jaw-dropping, highlight-reel worthy plays this season as many QBs have in a career.\n\nMahomes' arm strength has drawn rave reviews. Ask any coach, player, scout or reporter who has seen him play about him, and there's usually a tale about one of his throws.\n\nMayfield said he's \"absolutely\" jealous of Mahomes' rocket right arm.\n\n\"There was a play in that college game, he was rolling to his left, flicked it and it went about 65 in the air for a touchdown back of the end zone,\" Mayfield said, remembering the OU-Texas Tech classic in '16. \"He does stuff that you can't even think of even being possible.\"\n\nMayfield was surprised Mahomes wasn't taken in 2017 with the No. 1 pick, which ended up being Browns defensive end Myles Garrett.\n\n\"Talent-wise, I thought he should have been. I love Myles but,\" Mayfield said with a smile.\n\n\"Coming from the Texas Tech system, there are always your skeptics about people doubting the fact that all he did was sit back there and throw the ball. He threw it 88 times in our game, but when it comes down to it, throwing the ball is throwing the ball, and he is really good at it.\"\n\nSo is Mayfield.\n\nWhile Mahomes only started one game as a rookie last season, Mayfield was thrust into the lineup in Week 3 when Tyrod Taylor was hurt.\n\nMayfield doesn't have nearly the same supporting cast as Mahomes, but he's put up respectable numbers and feels he's learning with every snap.\n\n\"His talent is through the roof,\" Mahomes said of Mayfield. \"He is going to keep getting better every single week. He has already had a lot of success. The sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nOn Sunday, they'll go at it again \u2014 pass for pass, play for play \u2014 in what appears to be a mismatch with the Chiefs rolling and the Browns reeling.\n\nBut beyond the score, the NFL could get its first glimpse at a budding QB rivalry. It's not Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning, but that one started somewhere too.\n\n\"I would absolutely not say that it going to be Brady-Manning right now, but it is humbling to be in that conversation,\" Mayfield said.\n\n\"If he keeps playing that way, there is no reason why it would not be on his side of things. Now, I just have to pick up my side and play better.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 DeAndre Jordan has turned his most embarrassing weakness into a strength worth celebrating, yet getting him to talk about it is no easy task.\n\nWhy not? Because not talking about it means not thinking about it, and not thinking about it was the secret to fixing the problem.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks center\u2019s free throw shooting woes were so entrenched heading into this season that they were almost part of his charm, with a career mark of 45.0 percent spread over a decade.\n\nThis season has seen an extraordinary revolution in his productivity from the stripe, with the 6\u201911 former Los Angeles Clipper firing at a 82.4 percent clip heading into Friday\u2019s home clash with the New York Knicks.\n\nThat kind of shift is way beyond a typical level of improvement and doesn\u2019t come close to falling within your standard deviation based on a sample size that is still relatively small. It\u2019s the kind of thing that makes you wonder if there isn\u2019t an imposter wearing a Jordan mask suiting up for the Mavs each night, while still retaining all of the big man\u2019s rebounding and defensive skills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying not to think about it as much (as before),\u201d Jordan told USA TODAY Sports, when asked what he had changed. The whole \u201cnot thinking\u201d thing might not seem like a big deal, but it is. Jordan, 30, used to think and think and overthink, his mind tortured by the expectation of failure and the potential for humiliation, and it would drive him to distraction.\n\nOpposition crowds knew of his free throw troubles all too well and needed no encouragement to remind him of them, while the Hack-a-Jordan policy was routinely used by teams that figured fouling him was an easy way to get the ball back with minimal damage.\n\nNo longer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been working on it,\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Getting a lot of reps up. I think it is just being comfortable up there too, focusing on my routine and what I\u2019m working on.\u201d\n\nAfter eight games, Jordan had shot from the line 34 times and sunk 28 of those efforts. As of Thursday, it put him a very respectable 60th in the league among qualified players and ahead of the likes of James Harden, LeBron James and Kevin Love.\n\nHis stroke looks smooth, his feet are slightly staggered by design but he seems perfectly balanced, and more than anything, comes across as someone with the confidence and ability to knock the shot down instead of a startled deer who wishes he was anywhere else.\n\nPerhaps it was as simple as a change in scenery. Jordan was with the Clippers for 10 years and nearly joined the Mavs three years ago, before a late change of mind when members of L.A.\u2019s playing and coaching staff staged a dramatic intervention.\n\nSince switching to Texas he has been given greater responsibility at both ends of the floor and is flourishing. Dallas is 2-6 but has shown signs of promise under head coach Rick Carlisle, with Slovenian youngster Luka Doncic already a leading rookie of the year contender. Jordan signed a one-year deal for around $24 million, and his enhanced free throw ability will do no harm to his chances of landing a longer term max deal at the end of the campaign.\n\nHe believes the mental contentment he feels in Dallas has had a tangible impact on his game.\n\n\u201cIt was a great 10 years for me (in L.A.),\u201d he added. \u201cBut this has been a chance for me to step outside the box. I am a person that doesn\u2019t do well with change but this has been a great experience. The game is always going to change and the world is always going to change, we are going to change as people. I\u2019m trying to focus on what is present and everything else will happen naturally.\u201d", "bad url", "Justin Wayne pitched for the Marlins from 2002 to 2004, posting a 5-8 record and a 6.13 ERA.

The study appeared in the journal American Politics Research.\n\n\"Contrary to the widely shared belief that weather conditions do not change voters\u2019 electoral decisions,\" the study said, \"our analysis suggests that it is likely that a certain proportion of American voters would change their party preference depending on weather.\"\n\nSo apparently on Election Day, rain heightens pessimism and increases fears of risk: \"Those who feel in an upbeat mood may lean toward the riskier candidate, while those who feel depressed and anxious lean toward the safer candidate,\" the study said.\n\nThus, \"the choice for risk-averse people is to vote Republican,\" Horiuchi said.\n\nAnother expert, Mike Bender of the University of North Florida, told AccuWeather that voters affected by weather are borderline voters, folks who vote only occasionally.

He\u2019s resurrected talking points from his 2016 presidential campaign and raised new ones to fire up his political base ahead of next week\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nHe\u2019s highlighted the issue at campaign rallies and press conferences. He\u2019s ordered the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to respond to his claims of a \u201cnational emergency\u201d at the southern border, deploying the military. And since he first mentioned the caravan of Central American migrants on Oct. 16, he\u2019s tweeted about the issue 34 times.\n\nTucked into one of those tweets, in between rants against Democrats and so-called \u201copen borders,\u201d he had made the reason behind his immigration agenda abundantly clear: \u201cRemember the Midterms!\u201d\n\nThe president has already made major moves on immigration in his first 21 months in office, instituting a controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries, trying to end programs that have protected more than 1 million immigrants from deportation, and increasing arrests of undocumented immigrants throughout the nation.\n\nBut in the homestretch leading into the midterm elections, he\u2019s kicked his immigration rhetoric into another gear. Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s threats and claims on the hot-button issue of immigration over the past two weeks:\n\nClaimed tent cities are under construction\n\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, Trump said his administration was already building \"massive cities of tents\" along the southern border to detain migrants claiming asylum. But the federal agencies that would perform that work could not confirm any construction plans on Friday.\n\nGen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, commander of U.S. Northern Command, said earlier in the week that the more than 7,000 active-duty troops being deployed to the southwest border are only there to answer a request from the Department of Homeland Security to build tents to house Customs and Border Protection personnel. On Friday, the Pentagon reiterated that position.\n\n\"There has been no formal request to set up tents to house migrants,\" said Northern Command spokesman Bill Lewis.\n\nWhen asked whether any construction was ongoing, spokespeople from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement all declined to comment, referring questions to the White House.\n\nIn this file photo taken on July 7, 2017, Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto shake hands during a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany.

Hundreds of thousands of people cross that southwest border each day, from fleets of cargo trucks shipping produce and other products throughout the U.S. to people who live on one side of the border and go to school or work on the other.\n\nAltogether, the U.S. State Department estimates that $1.7 billion in goods and services legally cross the border each day.\n\nSan Ysidro Port Director Sidney Aki (right) gestures toward the line of cars entering the U.S. from Mexico during a tour of the port on October 26, 2018, in San Diego, Calif.

In that case, 122 members were caught illegally entering the country, but 401 did exactly what they said they were going to do: presented themselves at ports of entry and legally requested asylum.\n\nOf the 401 who requested asylum, 93 percent passed an initial test where they must establish that they have a \"credible fear\" of returning to their home country, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nClaimed the caravan includes criminals, \u2018Middle Easterners\u2019\n\nAfter the caravan crossed into Mexico, Trump turned up his attacks with an Oct. 22 Tweet claiming without evidence that there were criminals and \"Middle Easterners\" mixed into the caravan.\n\nA Homeland Security spokesman Tweeted that the department had confirmed the president's claim, but provided no evidence. Instead, it circulated data showing that of the nearly 400,000 people caught illegally crossing the southern border in fiscal year 2018, 4.4 percent had criminal backgrounds, 0.3 percent were gang members, and 0.8 percent were \"special interest aliens,\" defined by the Government Accountability Office as \u201caliens from countries of special interest to the United States such as Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from the White House the following day, Trump admitted that he had \"no proof\" of criminals or terrorists in the caravan. \"There's no proof of anything,\" he said. \"But they could very well be.\"\n\nSadly, it looks like Mexico\u2019s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy. Must change laws! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2018\n\nOrdered active-duty military troops to border\n\nAfter threatening for days to deploy the military, Trump gave the official order on Sunday, deploying active-duty troops to the border to complement the 16,500 Border Patrol agents manning the border and the 2,100 National Guard troops who have been stationed there since April under a separate order from Trump.\n\nThe estimated size of the active-duty mobilization has been increasing almost daily. Administration officials originally said it would be about 800 troops. On Monday, Gen. Terrence O'Shaugnessy, commander of U.S. Northern Command, said it would be 5,200 troops. On Wednesday, the Pentagon said it would more than 7,000 troops.\n\nAnd then Trump said the number could balloon all the way up to 15,000.\n\nWith the caravan down to 3,500 migrants and still weeks away from the border, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, summed up widespread criticism to the deployment: \"There is absolutely no reason to further politicize and militarize this humanitarian crisis.\"\n\nThreatened to end birthright citizenship\n\nWith the countdown to election winding down, Trump turned his attention to another item on the anti-immigrant wish list: birthright citizenship.\n\nIn an interview with \"Axios on HBO\" Trump declared that he could eliminate birthright citizenship, which confers U.S. citizenship on anybody born on U.S. soil, through an executive order. \"It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don't,\" he said.\n\nMost legal scholars, and even House Speaker Paul Ryan, disagree. Birthright citizenship was adopted as part of the 14th Amendment 150 years, and upheld by the Supreme Court 30 years later.\n\nTrump also claimed that the U.S. was the only country to grant birthright citizenship, even though 30 countries \u2014 including Canada and Mexico \u2014 also grant it.\n\nTweeted a racially-charged political ad\n\nThe president took to Twitter again on Thursday to highlight a racially-charged political ad that is interspersed with a video of an undocumented immigrant who killed two California deputies. It includes footage of the migrant caravan.\n\n\"It is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now!\" the president tweeted alongside the ad.\n\nThe ad was immediately blasted as racist for its attempts to brand members of the migrant caravan with a confessed killer, and misleading for its claims that Democrats allowed the immigrant into the country.\n\n\"You are a despicable divider; the worse social poison to afflict our country in decades,\" wrote Al Cardenas, the former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, in a Tweet that has since been deleted. \"This ad, and your full approval of it, will condemn you and your bigoted legacy forever in the annals of America\u2019s history books.\"\n\nIt is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now! https://t.co/0pWiwCHGbhpic.twitter.com/2crea9HF7G \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2018\n\nThreatened to cut aid to Central America\n\nThe president started with a tweet on Oct. 16, threatening to cut off the $500 million in foreign aid the U.S. sends to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras if they allowed the caravan to cross their borders.\n\nTrump has repeated that threat several times in an effort to get those governments to prevent their citizens from leaving.\n\nBut critics say cutting off funding for those Central American nations would only worsen the dangerous conditions that drive people away in the first place. U.S. assistance has been used by the U.S. Agency for International Development, non-governmental organizations, and each nation's government to improve their economy, military, law enforcement agencies, justice programs, anti-drug efforts, and to crack down on corruption.\n\nThreatened to tear up renegotiated NAFTA deal\n\nAs the caravan approached Mexico, Trump set his sights on Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whose term ends Dec. 1.\n\nOn Oct. 18, Trump said the \"assault on our country\" by the migrant caravan was more important to him than the $1.2 trillion-a-year United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that he had just finalized earlier in the month to replace a NAFTA deal he had long decried.\n\nPe\u00f1a Nieto responded by sending two Boeing 727 planes filled with federal police to the southern border, and by offering work permits and public health benefits to caravan members. The caravan brushed past the Mexican police; 1,700 migrants accepted the government's offer.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2018/11/01/donald-trump-immigration-migrant-caravan-central-america-asylum-midterm-elections/1846817002/", "New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold warms up before an NFL football game against the Chicago Bears Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018, in Chicago. (AP Photo/David Banks) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Mike Maccagnan is living in the present \u2014 with an eye on the New York Jets' future.\n\nThe fourth-year general manager is far from pleased or satisfied with the team's third straight 3-5 start. He also insists there's plenty of time left before this season can be accurately judged.\n\nPlayoffs or not, Maccagnan knows this: He and the rest of the franchise believe they've got their quarterback in Sam Darnold and the Jets will have plenty of money \u2014 about $100 million \u2014 to build around him during what the GM says will be a \"very active\" offseason for the team.\n\n\"We have a lot of things in place that with a successful offseason,\" Maccagnan said Thursday, \"we can actually put ourselves in a position \u2014 with cap space and cash in free agency, along with our draft picks \u2014 in our mind to really springboard this thing forward.\"\n\nMaccagnan's future with the Jets isn't a stone-cold lock beyond this season, and neither is that of coach Todd Bowles. New York has a game Sunday at Miami and home against Buffalo next Sunday before taking its bye-week break.\n\nThe Jets might have a good sense of where this season is headed at that point. An eighth straight year without a playoff appearance won't sit well with fans, and maybe not with owner Christopher Johnson, either.\n\n\"Where Sam Darnold is today is not where he's going to be a year from now or two years from now,\" Maccagnan said. \"The goal is the playoffs. If you don't make the playoffs, are we moving the team in that direction?\"\n\nProgress is the key, and that's the goal over New York's final eight games of the regular season. Not that the Jets have chalked up this season to developing Darnold, and wins be damned.\n\n\"I don't know if you go in with the mindset of, 'Hey, we're just going to write this one off,'\" Maccagnan said. \"We're like everybody else: We want to win football games.\"\n\nThe Jets haven't done that consistently enough over the past three years under Maccagnan and Bowles. Part of the issue has been the lack of success in the draft during that span \u2014 with only 13 of 22 picks taken from 2015-17 still on the roster \u2014 despite Maccagnan saying he feels \"pretty good\" about his selections.\n\nBut this season is different in the sense that New York has Darnold, the No. 3 overall pick who has started from Week 1 and been the anointed face of the franchise since his name was called by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell at the draft in April.\n\nIt has been an up-and-down season for Darnold, whose 10 interceptions are tied for the most in the league. There are spurts of brilliance, though, and a mental approach that has been highly praised by coaches, teammates, opponents and media, along with his natural instincts.\n\n\"When you look at him from kind of his approach to the game, his work ethic,\" Maccagnan said, \"it's something we knew coming in, but obviously watching him kind of handle that situation, handle the locker room, how he approaches it, his passion to be good and his competitiveness, that's been a really big positive for him.\"\n\nSo far, that has been one of the few things Jets fans have been able to feel good about this season.\n\nMaccagnan understands the record isn't ideal. Neither are the tough losses. Patience, for now, is being preached.\n\n\"It's not enjoyable to go out and lose games every week,\" Maccagnan said. \"I think anybody who has gone through that, or is currently going through that, it's not a great experience. That's not what we get paid to do. But I do think that you're going to have to go through that maturation process at some point in time with the quarterback.\"\n\nStill, Maccagnan said the Jets' focus is trying to win as many games as they can in the second half of the season.\n\n\"There's things that we're going to go through this season that will help us going forward,\" Maccagnan said. \"The idea is that, in the end, our goal is to go out there and compete consistently for the playoffs.\"\n\nThat's the delicate balance of a GM in Maccagnan's position: trying to marry the short-term goals with the long-term view for the franchise.\n\n\"Where we are right now, we're not at the end result yet,\" Maccagnan said. \"But we're in the process where we feel really good about some of the pieces we have and we're going through a maturation process.\"\n\nNOTES: CB Trumaine Johnson (quadriceps) was limited at practice after sitting out team drills the past three weeks.

Hill's first television project post-ESPN addresses three areas she is extremely familiar with: sports, the NBA and politics. Hill is the narrator of \"Shut Up and Dribble,\" a three-part series that debuts on Showtime on Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, that provides an inside look at the role of athletes in culture and politics through the lens of the NBA. The series executive producer is LeBron James. (Showtime via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJemele Hill's first couple months since leaving ESPN have been busy. There have been speaking engagements, writing for The Atlantic and starting to set up her own production company.\n\nWhat Hill hasn't done is appear on television. But that changes on Saturday when Hill debuts as the narrator for the Showtime documentary series \"Shut Up and Dribble.\" The three-part project examines the intersection of three subjects she is extremely familiar with \u2014 basketball, culture and politics.\n\n\"It has been busy (since leaving ESPN) but it also has been exciting and exhilarating,\" Hill said. \"I like to align myself with people and content that will resonate.\"\n\nWhen Hill left her role as a co-host on \"SC6\" after one year to return to writing, many wondered how long it would be before she left ESPN. Her last day was Sept. 14 after both sides agreed to a buyout.\n\nWhile the \"SC6\" show with Michael Smith had a different tone compared to other SportsCenter programs, it ended up not being a good fit for all parties and struggled with ratings.\n\n\"SportsCenter is SportsCenter. It wasn't the same as commentary shows,\" Hill said. \"It is more of a traditional news program. There wasn't a lot of wiggle room to inject personality.\"\n\nThat is not the case in Hill's first post-ESPN project. The series is a look at the changing role of NBA players on and off the court over the past 60 years. It is directed by Gotham Chopra. One of the executive producers is LeBron James and his SpringHill Entertainment company.\n\nIt is also the type of series that would likely not appeal to ESPN as network President Jimmy Pitaro has taken a harder line in trying to separate sports from politics. ESPN has strict social media policies to try to discourage its employees from discussing politics.\n\nThis is the first time Hill has narrated a project of this scope. She originally was interviewed for the series about the Pistons and the infamous \"Malice in the Palace\" brawl against the Indians Pacers, but as the project began to evolve Chopra asked her to take on a bigger role.\n\nESPN approved Hill to be a part of the series, but her role as narrator didn't happen until after she decided to leave the network.\n\nChopra, whose Religion of Sports series includes Tom Brady and Michael Strahan as executive producers, said this project was initially an exploration of how the NBA became the most culturally and social relevant league in America. As the interaction between current players and President Donald Trump became more heated, it started to take on a different theme.\n\nThe title comes from what Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham said after she took exception to James' and Kevin Durant's criticisms of Trump. According to Chopra, the series' title and its debut the weekend before the midterm elections are not a coincidence.\n\n\"I am a huge sports fan but politics is something I am passionate about,\" Chopra said. \"It really is a film about the nexus of sports, politics and social issues.\"\n\nJames and Hill are among many in the media and sports who have been subjected to criticism by the White House for being outspoken. Nearly a year before Hill left ESPN, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Hill should have been fired for a series of anti-Trump tweets.\n\nLast October, Hill was suspended for two weeks for violating the company's social media policy when she commented on Dallas owner Jerry Jones' handling of player protests during the national anthem.\n\n\"Not only did she have a personal interest, but she was a beat reporter, national commentator and was put on blast by the White House,\" Chopra said.\n\nJames addresses the Ingraham comment and the history of activism in the NBA during the opening minutes when he says, \"You go back in time and go back to the history. Without Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, that's just three guys. There were many more. Without those guys standing up for something that was more than dribbling a basketball, I am not sitting here talking to you today.\"\n\nHill has not watched the completed project, saying she wants to watch it in real time with the rest of the viewers, but there are a couple segments she said stand out.\n\nThere was Oscar Robertson testifying to congress in 1971 to secure free agency, Craig Hodges wearing an NBA jersey during the 3-point shooting contest at the All-Star Game in 1993 because no team would sign him due to his political beliefs, and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf refusing to participate in the national anthem in 1996.\n\n\"The NBA has made the same mistakes that the NFL has made with Colin Kaepernick,\" Hill said. \"There is a consistent theme throughout the series that the black athlete should be happy with what they have and don't ask for a penny more.\"\n\nChopra, who grew up in Boston, said he grew up hating the Pistons, but developed a better appreciation of what those teams were dealing with after getting to sit down with Bill Laimbeer and Isaiah Thomas for interviews.\n\n\"The challenge with the film is there are great teams throughout generations but that is not what this is about. It is about what was going on beyond the court,\" he said.\n\nHill said she will be at a speaking engagement out of the country during Tuesday's election, but that she would be paying attention to the results.\n\n\"This is a very volatile time and hopefully the series helps try to explore who we are. It is hard not to be emotional at a time like this,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Deep down, Patriots fans realize this and are fearfully awaiting the day that his inevitable decline begins.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve seen plenty of analysts prematurely write the lede on Brady\u2019s career obituary after a rough stretch of results, only for the greatest quarterback ever to quickly prove those doubters wrong. But, typically, a more in-depth look at Brady\u2019s rough patches reveals the root of whatever problems he may appear to be having.\n\nBrady is in the middle of one of those rough patches right now. Mind you, that a bad run for the future hall-of-famer would be considered a good one for about 90% of starting quarterbacks. Brady is still completing 67.5% of his passes with a passer rating of 97.6. Those are undoubtedly good numbers, but we have come to expect more than good from Brady.\n\nFor the first time since the 2013 season, we cannot say \u201cthis version of Tom Brady is better than the one we saw last season.\u201d The 2018 Brady is a clearly step down from what we saw during his MVP campaign in 2017. And we now have statistical evidence backing that up\u2026\n\nHighest rate of off-target throws, 2018 (source: ESPN)\n\n1. Mitchell Trubisky 21.4%\n\n2. Tom Brady 21.3%\n\n3. Sam Darnold 20.8%\n\n4. Josh Rosen 20.1%\n\n5. Josh Allen 19.5% (Trubisky was 2nd highest in 2017, only trailing Kizer) \u2014 Scott Kacsmar (@FO_ScottKacsmar) October 31, 2018\n\nOnly Mitch Trubisky has been less accurate than Brady this season! The most precise quarterback we\u2019ve ever seen has been one of the least precise quarterbacks in 2018. Based on that alone, it\u2019s fair to speculate that, at 41, Brady might\u2019ve lost a few MPH off his fastball.\n\nBut as many people have mentioned in the replies to the tweet above, those numbers lack context. Brady didn\u2019t have Julian Edelman for the first four games, Rob Gronkowski doesn\u2019t look the same and Josh Gordon, the team\u2019s de facto No. 1 receiver, is still learning the offense.\n\nTo that, I\u2019d say Brady has never had problems working in new receivers in the past and 81.3% of his attempts have been thrown to receivers who were on the Patriots roster before this season. Gordon is the only new player with more than 20 targets.\n\nWe should also point out that Brady ranks 24th in the league in NextGen Stats\u2019 \u201cCompletion Percentage Over Expectation,\u201d which is based on depth of target and receiver separation, among other factors. So there isn\u2019t only one metric suggesting Brady isn\u2019t completing as many passes as he should be.\n\nJust to be fair, let\u2019s ignore those arguments and try to add some context to Brady\u2019s off-target throw percentage. To do so, we went back and looked at every incomplete pass he\u2019s thrown since Week 5 \u2014 Edelman\u2019s first game back \u2014 and placed them into six categories: Inaccurate, intentional, miscommunication, drop and defense.\n\nBefore we take a look at the numbers, here\u2019s an example of each category\u2026\n\nInaccurate\n\nNo explanation needed here. Any throw that didn\u2019t give the receiver a chance to catch it, or forced him to adjust awkwardly was marked as inaccurate.\n\nIntentional\n\nThis includes throwaways, spikes and passes to protect his receiver.\n\nMiscommunication\n\nWe tried to give Brady the benefit of the doubt here. If it looked like a miscommunication, that\u2019s how we labeled it. That\u2019s based on the assumption Brady knows the offense better than anyone.\n\nDrop\n\nWe all know a drop when we see one.\n\nDefense\n\nThis includes plays where Brady was hit as he threw or a defensive back made a play on the ball or he was throwing away from tight coverage.\n\nOK, now that we have that covered, the results\u2026\n\nOf the 43 incompletions Brady has thrown over the last four games, 17 were the result of a poor throw. That accounts for 10.6% of this total attempts over that time.\n\nWhile that number isn\u2019t nearly as bad as 21.3%, it still isn\u2019t very good. We\u2019ve done similar studies for other NFL quarterbacks such as Andrew Luck, Josh Rosen and Tyrod Taylor, and their results were more favorable than Brady\u2019s. The closest to Brady was Taylor. While Taylor may be a bit underrated, that is not the company Brady should be in.\n\nBrady\u2019s tape is actually a lot more concerning than the numbers. He has thrown an uncharacteristically high number of bad throws over the last months. He\u2019s missing the kind of throws he used to make with ease.\n\nAnd there is a distinct pattern to his inaccuracy: When he misses on shorter, driven throws, he almost always misses low to stationary targets or wide to moving targets.\n\nWhen he\u2019s missed perimeter throws downfield, the ball has been high and to the outside.\n\nThese are typically the kind of misses we see from quarterbacks with an arm strength deficiency. Brady has never had the strongest arm but it\u2019s never been a problem for him. That may be starting to change as Brady gets deeper into his 40s.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that Brady hasn\u2019t been his typical self. But can we say Brady isn\u2019t every going to be his typical self again? Those are two very different statements. If Brady is in decline, we\u2019d next have to figure out how steep that decline will be \u2014 it\u2019s certainly not out of the question that one of the most dedicated players we\u2019ve ever seen finds a way to adjust. But if he doesn\u2019t it will be fair to wonder whether Patriots offense can still be as good as it needs to be to compete for a Super Bowl without No. 12 playing at an elite level. For years Brady \u2014 and elite coaching \u2014 has helped elevate a mishmash of players to keep the Patriots toward the top of the league. Eventually he\u2019s going to need some help, and he\u2019s not getting it now.\n\nIt\u2019s way too early to give any definitive answers to those questions, but we can say this: If Brady\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t pick up over the second half of the season, we\u2019ll have to re-evaluate his status as an elite quarterback in the offseason, and the Patriots will have to start seriously considering life after Brady.", "Pharrell Williams speaks onstage for Pharrell Williams and Illumination's Chris Meledandri on Creativity and Collaboration during Day 2 of the Fast Company Innovation Festival, Wednesdy, in New York .

Bush related to Petty's fightin' words enough to choose this song as his 2000 campaign theme, with Petty eventually threatening to sue Bush to stop his use of the song.\n\n\"Take a Chance on Me,\" ABBA\n\nSimilarly, ABBA wasn't willing to take a chance on John McCain's presidential campaign, asking the politician to choose another theme for his campaign.\n\n\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered,\" Stevie Wonder\n\nBarack Obama relied on a stable of soul classics to soundtrack his presidential wins, with this Stevie Wonder favorite among the songs that will forever be associated with his campaigns.\n\n\"Shipping Up to Boston,\" The Dropkick Murphys\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took the stage to this rousing track before the band publicly requested that he stop using their songs.\n\n\"This Land is Your Land,\" Woody Guthrie\n\nA historic favorite at political rallies, this Woody Guthrie staple was used by George H.W. Bush for his successful run.\n\n\"Happy,\" Pharrell\n\nThe singer became the most recent artist to come out against President Trump using his music last week, when he filed a cease-and-desist requesting \"Happy\" no longer be used.\n\n\"Fortunate Son,\" Creedence Clearwater Revival\n\nCCR's anti-Vietnam War anthem was curiously chosen by John Kerry to soundtrack his unsuccessful 2004 campaign.\n\n\"Everyday America,\" Sugarland\n\nObama didn't just use funk and soul songs for his campaigns, drawing on this country track during his 2012 campaign.\n\n\"Born Free,\" Kid Rock\n\nKid Rock gave his blessing to Mitt Romney for the politician to use this track during campaign rallies.\n\n\"Keep on Pushing,\" The Impressions\n\nThis 1964 track from Curtis Mayfield and his backing band was a civil rights anthem, so it's appropriate that Obama added it to his roster of rally songs.\n\n\"Greater,\" MercyMe\n\nMarco Rubio handpicked this song for his 2016 campaign soundtrack.\n\n\"High Hopes,\" Frank Sinatra\n\nThis Sinatra classic has historical significance as the official campaign theme of John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/01/election-day-playlist-15-famous-campaign-songs/1833234002/", "Donald Trump (Photo: John Moore)\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump plans to call for new limits on asylum claims.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The NBA's spotlight faded from Cleveland last summer. It will shine brilliantly again in four years.\n\nAfter numerous \"passionate\" discussions between the team and league, Commissioner Adam Silver announced Thursday that the Cavaliers will host the 2022 All-Star Game at Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nThe Cavaliers are thrilled to host the event, which will coincide with the league's 75th anniversary. Cleveland previously hosted the All-Star Game in 1997, when the league honored its Top 50 players.\n\nIt's a major coup for the Cavs, who lost superstar LeBron James as a free agent in July and are facing a long road back to championship contention.\n\nThe Cavs had submitted bids to host earlier All-Star Games, but their downtown arena is undergoing a massive renovation and wasn't going to be ready until summer 2019.\n\nSilver said the renovations played a major role in the city being awarded the game and its other activities which could have a direct $100 million impact on Cleveland.\n\n\"This event is so big now,\" Silver said. \"We have 1,000 members of the media. The festivities are televised, I should say distributed, not just televised, in 250 countries and territories that we need a massive infrastructure in order to do it. Because the conversations were ongoing about potential upgrades in the building we wanted to wait until those discussions were done and obviously successful before we could lock in the day.\"\n\nHosting the NBA's signature event was a major goal for the franchise.\n\n\"It puts Cleveland on the stage for the whole world to see,\" Gilbert said. \"It's great for the region. You can't measure all the stuff and how important it is for the future growth and reputation for a city like Cleveland that's clearly on the way back.\"\n\n\"There's been some back and forth as the civic leaders have been discussing and debating exactly what to do here,\" he said. \"We think it worked out really well.\"\n\nCharlotte will host the game this season, followed by Chicago and Indianapolis.\n\nThe increase around the NBA in scoring early in the season has been a hot topic among coaches and players. Silver believes the league's new rules that have led to more offense are going well.\n\n\"We had a call with our competition committee last week, which is made up of coaches, GMs, owners, players, officials to discuss just that,\" he said. \"And the consensus, or the strong feeling from the group, was that the rule changes were happening as we intended.\"\n\nSilver said the intent of the new rules is to cut down on defensive players clutching and grabbing.\n\n\"The question that seems to be coming back from some of the coaches and players is in essence is how much physicality will be allowed on defense,\" he said. \"Everybody's feeling their way through this a little bit. What we're hearing is the teams will adjust to wherever we end up, they just want to make sure there is consistency across the league.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 University of Miami athletic director Blake James says it's good to have a basketball corruption trial in the past and with no indication of wrongdoing by coach Jim Larranaga's Hurricanes' program.\n\nA federal jury in New York last week found three men guilty of fraud charges for channeling secret payment to the families of top-tier recruits to influence their choices of schools, apparel companies and agents.

Time\n\nBarbra Streisand is out with a new tour and a new album. (Photo: Steve Jennings, WireImage)\n\nWith emotions swirling over midterms halfway through President Donald Trump's first term, a familiar threat has risen again: \"If ________ win(s), I\u2019m moving to Canada.\" Barbra Streisand told the New York Times she may head north if Republicans hold their grip on the House next week, saying political worries have driven her to eat pancakes, which are, she lamented, \"very fattening.\"\n\nMoving to Canada may not help Streisand\u2019s pancake habit \u2014 she likes hers with maple syrup \u2014 but experts on decision making say devastated Americans won't likely move post-election, anyway. The reason? We\u2019re really, really bad at predicting how we\u2019ll be feeling in the future.\n\nThe process is called affective forecasting, and its why psychologists roll their eyes every two-to-four years when the \"move-to-Canada\" outcries flare up. Humans are good at predicting how an event will affect us \u2014 positively or negatively \u2014 but not how much or how long, research suggests.\n\n\u201cA lot of things people think will make them miserable \u2014 an illness or an amputation or someone they detest winning an election \u2014 as things pass by, those things have a negligible effect on people\u2019s happiness levels,\u201d said Edie Greene, a University of Colorado psychology professor who studies how decision-making affects laws.\n\nThat\u2019s because, well, life goes on. And over time, our happiness settles back to wherever it was prior. Greene points to a classic study from the 1970s that showed lottery winners' experienced a short-term spike in happiness only to, eventually, re-stabilize to the happiness they held before \u2014 levels virtually equal to those who did not win the lottery at all.\n\nAfter fortune or tragedy, Greene said, there are still dishes to be cleaned, groceries to be bought and TV to be watched. The constellation of factors affecting our lives largely stays the same. And largely so do we.\n\n\u201cMost folks are surprised by that. Are we aware we don\u2019t predict our emotions very well? I think not,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we won\u2019t have very good ability to think into the future about something that is kind of intangible.\u201d\n\nThe moment you realize you won't really leave\n\nAt least two factors muddy our ability to think into the future, said Eva Buechel, a University of Southern California professor who researches decision making and judgement. The first is focalism, our tendency to obsess over a single event while downplaying the myriad other factors that shape our lives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on one thing, like the election, but once the election comes around, it\u2019s (only) one thing that happens in our lives,\u201d Buechel said. \u201cBut others do, too: We might be proposed to. We might get a raise.\u201d\n\nAnd that raise or new spouse might outweigh any election outcome.\n\nA second factor is construal level theory, a concept within social psychology that says the further away an event is \u2014 say, a move to Canada \u2014 the more we see it in an idealized, holistic way.\n\n\"The problem is, as events come closer, like then when you see whole forest versus the trees, everything becomes more concrete, and you realize: I can\u2019t leave this country,\u201d Buechel said.\n\nShe continued: \u201cMaybe (you) don\u2019t have the passport. It would mean quitting your job. Moving away from your family. These things become complete, versus a whole representation. You don\u2019t want to live in this country, but you also don\u2019t want to be far from your family.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s immigration site crashed repeatedly under heavy traffic in the days following Trump\u2019s election. But a year-plus into his presidency, only about 2,000 more Americans than normal actually moved there, Canada\u2019s Global News reported, amounting to \"a modest uptick.\u201d\n\nAfter Democrats\u2019 last presidential defeat in 2004, Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert said few would move to Canada then because of humans\u2019 natural ability to glom onto happiness and accentuate it after a disappointment. In a Times column, he describes how the brain finds \u201csilver linings, and most linings are sufficiently variegated to reward the mind's quest.\u201d\n\nGuessing how you\u2019ll feel after a major event is tough \u2014 \u201cI study this extensively, every day, and I\u2019m still terrible at it,\u201d Buechel said \u2014 but there\u2019s one trick that Buechel and Greene note might help: Remembering how you felt right after a similar event last happened.\n\nDid you move after Trump (or Obama) was elected? If you didn\u2019t then, you likely won\u2019t now.\n\n\u201cVery much about ourselves will stay the same,\u201d Greene said. \u201cVery much about our circumstances will stay the same.\u201d\n\nFollow Josh Hafner on Twitter: @joshhafner\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/01/midterm-elections-2018-move-canada-barbra-streisand/1838909002/", "Connecticut head coach Randy Edsall looks in the direction of the scoreboard during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Massachusetts, Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018, in East Hartford, Conn.

We look forward to moving on.\"\n\nThe ethics board's ruling led to a change in state law allowing immediate family members to work in the same department within the higher education system under certain conditions.\n\nThe ethics board did not immediately return calls and emails Thursday seeking comment.\n\nThe elder Edsall is in his second stint as UConn's football coach. His teams have gone 4-16 over the past two seasons, including 1-7 (0-4 American) this season.

So do dates against the Chiefs, Falcons and Bengals (twice). You\u2019ll have to stomach a bye in Week 11, though.\n\nRB David Johnson, Arizona Cardinals\n\nYou were already buying low on him, particularly after Byron Leftwich started calling plays in Arizona. The Cards have the second-best schedule for running backs the rest of the way with matchups against the Chiefs, Raiders, Lions, Packers and Falcons, all of whom are 20th or worse against the run this season.\n\nWR Devin Funchess, Carolina Panthers\n\nThe Panthers have the top schedule the rest of the way for passers and wideouts. It\u2019s mostly because they get the Bucs twice, plus games against the Steelers, Saints and Falcons.\n\nTE David Njoku, Cleveland Browns\n\nIgnore last week\u2019s goose egg. The Browns have the second-best schedule for tight ends, with remaining opponents allowing an average of 9.7 points per game.\n\nPlayers to trade away\n\nQB Matt Ryan, Atlanta Falcons\n\nHe doesn\u2019t throw interceptions, but maybe you don\u2019t like how he\u2019s thrown one or fewer scores in three of his contests this year. Couple that with dates against the Cowboys, Ravens, Packers and Cardinals, and maybe you sell high.\n\nRB Peyton Barber, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nHe was a sell-high candidate to begin with two scores in his last three games. But now I get to tell you that he\u2019ll face these stout run defenses: Carolina (twice), Washington, New Orleans, Baltimore, Dallas. Even the Niners are 13th against the run. Ugh. Find someone desperate for a running back and send him packing.\n\nRB Leonard Fournette, Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThis is partially because I don\u2019t trust the presence of Carlos Hyde, T.J. Yeldon will get some third-down work, and who knows how healthy he is. AND, on top of that, he\u2019s got the 25th-ranked schedule for running backs. A fellow owner will think he\u2019s buying low, but name recognition might help.\n\nWR Alshon Jeffery, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nTwo games against the Cowboys, a date against Marshon Lattimore in New Orleans and a Monday Night Football contest with the Redskins might be tough ones for the veteran wideout.", "There have been a lot of scorching Le\u2019Veon Bell takes over the last few years as the star running back has feuded with the Steelers front office over contract negotiations, but I\u2019m not sure any are approaching the take Ravens defensive coordinator Don \u201cWink\u201d Martindale dropped when asked about the absentee running back.\n\nRavens defensive coordinator Wink Martindale on absent Steelers RB Le'Veon Bell: \"There are a lot of stats [since 2015] that the Steelers are actually better without him.

In a contract year, they expected him to flourish as a starter. Instead, he's been giving his man too much cushion or getting fooled by quarterbacks burning him for big plays.\n\nMiddling drafts prior to this year's crescendo has left coach Vance Joseph (8-16) without the option of benching Bolles or Roby, although cornerback Tramaine Brock's return from a pulled hamstring and solid play over the past two weeks could foretell a return to some nickel back snaps for Roby.\n\nElway insists the Broncos can turn things around over the second half and avoid the franchise's first back-to-back losing seasons since 1971-72.\n\nIf not, Joseph could be out of a job.\n\nTexans coach Bill O'Brien was feeling the heat himself before J.J.

I learned so much ball from him, just how to study defenses, what type of leverages and coverages, just dissecting defenses. He taught me so much ball,\" Keenum said.\n\n\"Whatever it was that was said motivated me. Every coach I've ever had, they've gotten me to where I am now. I've got the utmost respect for him and the whole Texans organization.\"\n\nWATT A COMEBACK\n\nWatt has shaken off two years of injuries to return to superstardom with eight sacks, 10 tackles for loss, 13 quarterback hits and four forced fumbles. He's started all eight games this season after playing in just eight games combined over the previous two seasons because of a bad back and a broken leg.\n\n\"I can't sit here and get too mad at people who thought I might be washed up or thought I might be done because I was sitting in that same boat when I was sitting at home with a cast on my leg and not being able to walk, thinking, 'Man, will I be the same again?'\" Watt said.\n\n\"I still don't think I'm there yet. I still think I'm working and trying to get back there, but it's been fun to play, it's been fun to win, it's been fun to just go out there and make some plays.\"\n\nYOUTH SERVED\n\nSutton isn't the only Broncos rookie making a huge impact.

Deep down, Patriots fans realize this and are fearfully awaiting the day that his inevitable decline begins.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve seen plenty of analysts prematurely write the lede on Brady\u2019s career obituary after a rough stretch of results, only for the greatest quarterback ever to quickly prove those doubters wrong. But, typically, a more in-depth look at Brady\u2019s rough patches reveals the root of whatever problems he may appear to be having.\n\nBrady is in the middle of one of those rough patches right now. Mind you, that a bad run for the future hall-of-famer would be considered a good one for about 90% of starting quarterbacks. Brady is still completing 67.5% of his passes with a passer rating of 97.6. Those are undoubtedly good numbers, but we have come to expect more than good from Brady.\n\nFor the first time since the 2013 season, we cannot say \u201cthis version of Tom Brady is better than the one we saw last season.\u201d The 2018 Brady is a clearly step down from what we saw during his MVP campaign in 2017. And we now have statistical evidence backing that up\u2026\n\nHighest rate of off-target throws, 2018 (source: ESPN)\n\n1. Mitchell Trubisky 21.4%\n\n2. Tom Brady 21.3%\n\n3. Sam Darnold 20.8%\n\n4. Josh Rosen 20.1%\n\n5. Josh Allen 19.5% (Trubisky was 2nd highest in 2017, only trailing Kizer) \u2014 Scott Kacsmar (@FO_ScottKacsmar) October 31, 2018\n\nOnly Mitch Trubisky has been less accurate than Brady this season! The most precise quarterback we\u2019ve ever seen has been one of the least precise quarterbacks in 2018. Based on that alone, it\u2019s fair to speculate that, at 41, Brady might\u2019ve lost a few MPH off his fastball.\n\nBut as many people have mentioned in the replies to the tweet above, those numbers lack context. Brady didn\u2019t have Julian Edelman for the first four games, Rob Gronkowski doesn\u2019t look the same and Josh Gordon, the team\u2019s de facto No. 1 receiver, is still learning the offense.\n\nTo that, I\u2019d say Brady has never had problems working in new receivers in the past and 81.3% of his attempts have been thrown to receivers who were on the Patriots roster before this season. Gordon is the only new player with more than 20 targets.\n\nWe should also point out that Brady ranks 24th in the league in NextGen Stats\u2019 \u201cCompletion Percentage Over Expectation,\u201d which is based on depth of target and receiver separation, among other factors. So there isn\u2019t only one metric suggesting Brady isn\u2019t completing as many passes as he should be.\n\nJust to be fair, let\u2019s ignore those arguments and try to add some context to Brady\u2019s off-target throw percentage. To do so, we went back and looked at every incomplete pass he\u2019s thrown since Week 5 \u2014 Edelman\u2019s first game back \u2014 and placed them into six categories: Inaccurate, intentional, miscommunication, drop and defense.\n\nBefore we take a look at the numbers, here\u2019s an example of each category\u2026\n\nInaccurate\n\nNo explanation needed here. Any throw that didn\u2019t give the receiver a chance to catch it, or forced him to adjust awkwardly was marked as inaccurate.\n\nIntentional\n\nThis includes throwaways, spikes and passes to protect his receiver.\n\nMiscommunication\n\nWe tried to give Brady the benefit of the doubt here. If it looked like a miscommunication, that\u2019s how we labeled it. That\u2019s based on the assumption Brady knows the offense better than anyone.\n\nDrop\n\nWe all know a drop when we see one.\n\nDefense\n\nThis includes plays where Brady was hit as he threw or a defensive back made a play on the ball or he was throwing away from tight coverage.\n\nOK, now that we have that covered, the results\u2026\n\nOf the 43 incompletions Brady has thrown over the last four games, 17 were the result of a poor throw. That accounts for 10.6% of this total attempts over that time.\n\nWhile that number isn\u2019t nearly as bad as 21.3%, it still isn\u2019t very good. We\u2019ve done similar studies for other NFL quarterbacks such as Andrew Luck, Josh Rosen and Tyrod Taylor, and their results were more favorable than Brady\u2019s. The closest to Brady was Taylor. While Taylor may be a bit underrated, that is not the company Brady should be in.\n\nBrady\u2019s tape is actually a lot more concerning than the numbers. He has thrown an uncharacteristically high number of bad throws over the last months. He\u2019s missing the kind of throws he used to make with ease.\n\nAnd there is a distinct pattern to his inaccuracy: When he misses on shorter, driven throws, he almost always misses low to stationary targets or wide to moving targets.\n\nWhen he\u2019s missed perimeter throws downfield, the ball has been high and to the outside.\n\nThese are typically the kind of misses we see from quarterbacks with an arm strength deficiency. Brady has never had the strongest arm but it\u2019s never been a problem for him. That may be starting to change as Brady gets deeper into his 40s.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that Brady hasn\u2019t been his typical self. But can we say Brady isn\u2019t every going to be his typical self again? Those are two very different statements. If Brady is in decline, we\u2019d next have to figure out how steep that decline will be \u2014 it\u2019s certainly not out of the question that one of the most dedicated players we\u2019ve ever seen finds a way to adjust. But if he doesn\u2019t it will be fair to wonder whether Patriots offense can still be as good as it needs to be to compete for a Super Bowl without No. 12 playing at an elite level. For years Brady \u2014 and elite coaching \u2014 has helped elevate a mishmash of players to keep the Patriots toward the top of the league. Eventually he\u2019s going to need some help, and he\u2019s not getting it now.\n\nIt\u2019s way too early to give any definitive answers to those questions, but we can say this: If Brady\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t pick up over the second half of the season, we\u2019ll have to re-evaluate his status as an elite quarterback in the offseason, and the Patriots will have to start seriously considering life after Brady.", "CLOSE The 52-year-old Cornell died last week in Detroit. The singer and songwriter of Soundgarden died after a show. A preliminary autopsy concluded he hanged himself. His body will be laid to rest at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. USA TODAY\n\n, Chris Cornell poses for a portrait in Agoura Hills, Calif., in July 2015. (Photo: Casey Curry/Invision/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Family members of Chris Cornell on Thursday sued a doctor they say over-prescribed drugs to the rock singer, leading to his death.\n\nCornell, frontman for Soundgarden, died in May 2017 in Detroit; he was 52. The coroner ruled his death a suicide by hanging.\n\nToxicology tests showed there were drugs present in his body, including Ativan along with barbiturates, caffeine, the anti-opioid drug naloxone, and a decongestant.\n\nBut the autopsy report said the drugs were not a cause of death.\n\nCornell's widow, Vicky Cornell, and their children, Toni and Christopher, are plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court asserting that prescription drugs, especially the anti-anxiety drug Lorazepam (brand name Ativan), led to erratic behavior by Cornell before his death.\n\nThe lawsuit says Dr. Robert Koblin and his Beverly Hills office \"negligently and repeatedly\" prescribed \"dangerous mind-altering controlled substances to Chris Cornell which impaired Mr. Cornell's cognition, clouded his judgment, and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life.\"\n\nIt focuses in particular on Koblin's prescribing Cornell large amounts of Lorazepam \u2014 which is sold under the brand name Ativan \u2014 to Cornell in the 20 months leading up to his death.\n\nA life-size, bronze statue of late Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell stands outside the Museum of Pop Culture a day after its unveiling, Oct. 8, 2018, in Seattle. Cornell's wife, Vicky Cornell, commissioned the piece by artist Nick Marra. (Photo: Elaine Thompson/AP)\n\nThe lawsuit says the doctor knew that Cornell had a serious history of substance abuse, and he failed to examine or consult with him as he was prescribing the drugs.\n\nThe \"unmonitored use of such excessive amounts of Lorazepam ... was known to increase the risk of suicide because it can severely impair judgment, thinking and impulse control and diminish the ability of a patient to think and act rationally,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nStaff reached by phone at Koblin's office said there was no immediate comment.\n\nVicky Cornell has said since immediately after her husband's death that she felt the prescription drugs he was taking drove him to behave strangely, and there were no signs he might take his own life.\n\n\"At the time of his death, Mr. Cornell had everything to live for and was planning a future of recordings, performances and continued work as a charitable activist,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nCornell's wailing voice and his long-haired, shirtless stage presence made him an essential figure in the grunge-rock of the 1990s. Soundgarden was among the first groups to surge to national attention in a wave that later included Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains.\n\nCornell also fronted the super-groups Audioslave with members of Rage Against The Machine and Temple of the Dog with members of Pearl Jam.\n\nLast month, a bronze statue of Cornell by artist Nick Marra, commissioned by his widow and depicting the singer in one of his typical poses with his signature boots, dog tag and long hair, was erected outside the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle.\n\nThe lawsuit, which seeks damages to be determined later, also names anonymous staffers at Koblin's office as defendants.\n\nCornell's oldest daughter, 18-year-old Toni Cornell, is also named as a defendant, but the lawsuit emphasizes that she is a nominal defendant only, as required by law because she is heir to her father's estate.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/01/chris-cornell-family-sues-doctor-over-prescribed-drugs-led-suicide/1848981002/", "In announcing its decision to nix funding for United Nations Refugee and Works Agency, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. could no longer \u201cshoulder the very disproportionate share of the burden of UNRWA\u2019s costs.\u201d (Photo: AFP PHOTO / Mandel Ngan)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Heather Nauert, a former Fox News anchor and the current State Department spokeswoman, is a leading contender to be the next U.N. ambassador, President Donald Trump said Thursday.\n\n\"She\u2019s under very serious consideration.

Maybe it takes seeing her flaws to realize how spectacular an athlete she really is.\n\nMaybe by seeing her at her worst, we can now agree she is the best \u2014 in her and every other sport.\n\nBiles became the first woman to win four all-around titles at the world gymnastics championships Thursday despite falling on vault and balance beam. Her score of 57.491 was 1.693 points ahead of Japan\u2019s Mai Murakami, her largest margin of victory yet at worlds.\n\nThat Biles won \u2013 and won by that much \u2013 is not because her competition is inferior. Rather, it\u2019s because her level of difficulty, the skills she does, are so thoroughly superior.\n\n\u201cShe makes it look so easy. But this is as hard as men\u2019s gymnastics what she\u2019s doing on floor and vault,\u201d said Laurent Landi, Biles\u2019 coach. \u201cYou need to take this into consideration and appreciate her desire to go this road.\n\nMore: Simone Biles makes history as first woman to win four all-around world titles\n\n\u201cShe has a great ability that she needs to push it to the limit,\u201d Landi added. \u201cAnd when it goes very well, it\u2019s amazing. When it doesn\u2019t go well, it\u2019s still good enough.\u201d\n\nWe are living in a golden age of sport, witness to the likes of Serena Williams, LeBron James, Steph Curry, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Roger Federer and Tiger Woods. Yet what Biles is doing is more impressive than all of them.\n\nTheir sports do not require them to defy gravity at every turn. Catastrophic injuries for them are a fluke, not the routine risk Biles faces as she flips and twists 10 feet above the ground.\n\nMore than that, though, is how the 21-year-old Biles has redefined herself, and her sport.\n\nWhen she returned from her yearlong layoff after the Rio Olympics, where she won four gold medals, Biles could easily have kept doing what she already knew worked. Her difficulty level on vault and floor exercise alone was enough to give her a head start, and no one was likely to challenge that.\n\nThat isn\u2019t what brought Biles back, however. She\u2019d already established herself as the best gymnast of all time, had won the biggest prizes there are. Anything else would just be more of the same.\n\nNo, she came back because she wanted to see what she could do. To test her limits and see what her body was capable of. Could she master a vault so difficult some of the top men won\u2019t even try it? Could she add more tricks to a floor routine that already made astronauts dizzy?

That\u2019s why, despite her falls on vault and beam, she took a .092 lead into the fourth and final rotation, floor exercise.\n\nIt\u2019s also why, despite knowing she was having an off day, despite knowing she could do the bare minimum and still win, the thought of watering down floor was never a serious consideration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d still rather go out there and show who I am as a competitor,\u201d Biles said.\n\nShe crushed the floor routine, soaring so high on her tumbling passes that fans had to crane their necks to see her. She actually had so much power on the first pass that she put one foot out of bounds to steady herself, but the rest was dazzling.\n\nBy the end, Landi was clapping his hands above his head. Biles\u2019 score of 15 was a full point better than Murakami\u2019s, and her 6.6 difficulty score was the highest of the night on any event.\n\n\u201cThat defines everything that she is. That\u2019s why she\u2019s the best in the world,\u201d Landi said. \u201cBecause otherwise, it\u2019s like you\u2019re in the middle of the pack. You want to differentiate yourself.\u201d\n\nSure, the number of titles do that. But it\u2019s no longer about the medals or putting her name in the history books. If it was, Biles wouldn\u2019t have described her day as \u201ca bomb\u201d and questioned whether she\u2019d earned this latest crown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the gymnast that I am,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though I won, I wish it were a little bit different. \u2026 It just sucks that I did so bad and I still won.\u201d\n\nBy pushing herself, by refusing to settle for the status quo, Biles has made the impossible seem ordinary.

Here's what you need to know. USA TODAY\n\nDaylight saving time ends on Sunday, meaning it's time to fall back. (Photo: Leslie Smith, USA TODAY)\n\nIt's one of the rites of autumn, along with pumpkin spice, football games and raking leaves: The end of daylight saving time, which will occur at 2:00 a.m. Sunday November 4.\n\nSo if you're sick of dark mornings on your way to school or work, it's your time to rise and shine. But if you dread driving home in the dark, you're out of luck for the next few months.\n\nAt 2:00 a.m. on the 4th \u2013 or the night before \u2013 the few analog clocks still around must \"fall back\" an hour, turning 1:59:59 a.m. into 1 a.m. Microwaves and ovens are on a short list of household appliances that will need a manual adjustment.\n\nSince most of our computers, smartphones and DVRs do it automatically, it's not as much of a chore as it used to be.\n\nStarting Sunday, that one hour of daylight is basically shifted from evening to morning as standard time begins. We don't go back to daylight saving until Sunday, March 10, 2019, about 10 days before spring begins.\n\nSupposedly, the purpose of daylight saving is to save energy, to save lives (by preventing traffic accidents), and reduce crime.\n\nHere are 12 fun facts about daylight saving time you may not have known:\n\n1. While not necessarily advocating changing time, Benjamin Franklin urged his fellow countrymen to work during daylight and sleep after dark, thus saving money on candles. (It was likely a tongue-in-cheek comment.)\n\n2. The U.S. first implemented daylight saving during World War I as a way to conserve fuel with the Standard Time Act of 1918, also known as the Calder Act.In World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented a year-round daylight saving time that was commonly known as \"War Time.\"\n\n3. The correct term is daylight \"saving\" (not savings) time. However, the incorrect term \u201cdaylight savings time\u201d is commonly used, especially in Australia, Canada and the United States. It's also supposed to be lowercase, not uppercase, according to the Associated Press stylebook.\n\n4. Who knew? The U.S. Department of Transportation is in charge of time in the U.S., including time zones and daylight saving time.\n\n5. Daylight saving became a federal law in 1966, with passage of the Uniform Time Act. It was signed by President Lyndon Johnson.\n\n6. Only two states don't observe it \u2014 Hawaii and Arizona. Other non-observing U.S. territories include American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\n7. Parts of Indiana didn't observe daylight saving time until 2006, when it became a law statewide.\n\n8. Twenty-six states want to make DST year-round. Florida could be the first. However, the U.S. Congress would have to change the law to allow states to keep daylight saving year-round.\n\n9. Eight months of the year are in daylight time, and four months are in standard time.\n\n10. Adults 65 and older may struggle with the time change more than others.\n\n11. During the energy crisis of the 1970s, Congress ordered states to go on year-round daylight saving time between January 1974 and April 1975.\n\n12. Daylight saving is observed in approximately 70 countries, including most of those in North America and Europe.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/01/daylight-saving-time-ends-sunday-get-ready-fall-back/1846836002/", "", "CLOSE HGTV announced that they were the winning bid for the iconic \"Brady Bunch\" house that was for sale in North Hollywood for nearly 2 million dollars.

The Giants are (1-7). Their next game is Monday, Nov. 12 against the San Francisco 49ers. (AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The NFL trading deadline passed and the New York Giants decided to stand pat despite speculation they would be wheeling and dealing with a second straight season going down the tubes.\n\nLinebacker Olivier Vernon, cornerback Janoris Jenkins and safety Landon Collins will finish the season with the Giants, who are 1-7 for the second straight year and have virtually no chance of making the playoffs in Pat Shurmur's first season as coach.\n\nCornerback Eli Apple and 2016 All-Pro defensive tackle Damon Harrison were the only players traded, and they were shipped the week before the deadline.\n\nHeading into their bye week, the question facing Shurmur is where does the team go from here.\n\nTo be honest, there isn't a lot he can do. This team has only made the playoffs once since winning the Super Bowl in 2012. There is not a lot of depth.\n\nThe one change fans and the media want is at quarterback. Two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning is as stationary as a quarterback can be and that does not work in the NFL, especially when his offense line is playing poorly. The 37-year-old has been sacked 31 times and this past Sunday he seemed to ducking as soon as the pressure got near him.\n\nMany wanted Shurmur to put in rookie Kyle Lauletta to see what the fourth-round pick out of Richmond could do.\n\nThat's probably not going to happen now.\n\nThe 22-year-old was arrested Tuesday on motor vehicle and related disorderly persons offenses while driving near a road construction site to practice.\n\nWeehawken police said he failed to obey a police officer's order and almost hit the officer while making an illegal turn. He was charged with eluding police, obstructing administration of law and resisting arrest. He was also charged with reckless driving, disregarding an officer's directions, improper turn and failure to remain in a marked lane.\n\nHe might face a league suspension. The Giants would look foolish replacing Manning for him. Veteran Alex Tanney also isn't the answer.\n\n\"We're trying to do what we can to win this season, and certainly you always do what you can in the short run,\" Shurmur said before heading into the bye.\n\nWhat the Giants will do is evaluate all facets of their games to find plays that work.\n\nThere is little they can do with the offense line. It was revamped to start the season and 60 percent has changed. Center Jon Halapio broke a leg and is done for the season. Right tackle Ereck Flowers was cut and free agent right guard Patrick Omameh struggled, was hurt and lost his job. Left tackle Nate Solder, the big free agent signing who has struggled at times, and rookie second-round draft pick Will Hernandez are the only starters remaining.\n\nThe talent in the skill positions is obvious. Odell Beckham Jr. (61 catches for 785 yards) and Sterling Shepard (40 for 542) are outstanding receivers.\n\nShurmur needs to find a way to get second-year tight end Evan Engram more involved. He was an explosive receiver last season and that has been missing.\n\nSaquon Barkley, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, has helped the passing game, catching 58 passes for 497 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe biggest need is to get the running game going. Despite getting 519 yards from Barkley, the rest of the team has contributed just over 100 yards. It has allowed opposing defenses to play the pass, limiting the offense. The unit has hurt itself with penalties and sacks that have created too many third-and-long plays, and it has settled for too many field goals, averaging 18.5 points.\n\n\"We got good players,\" said Manning, who wants to remain the starting quarterback. \"There's some good football. There are some good plays. There's some big plays, some explosive plays. There's just some bad football as well. So, it's just cleaning up the bad stuff.\"\n\nThe positive for the Giants has been James Bettcher's defense. It has given the Giants a chance to win games. Its only drawback is it has not taken the ball away more. New York has seven takeaways.\n\n\"We always said from the beginning, we got all the weapons that we showcase, and we expected to win,\" Collins said of the season. \"So yeah, I'm very surprised by it.\"\n\nBarkley, who lost only five games in his last two seasons at Penn State, said losing in the NFL has been an adjustment for him, as it has been for many of his teammates.\n\n\"It's part of the NFL, it's a part of the sport. It's adversity right now,\" Barkley said. \"When we get this thing going, and we get this thing rolling, we're going to look back at this and laugh, and see how this made us tougher.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Tesla)\n\nFor most automakers, passenger-car sales are plunging while sales of SUVs, crossovers and pickups have been more resilient.\n\nAmerican preferences have shifted toward larger vehicles amid fuel economy improvements and low gasoline prices.\n\nThe shift has had a significant effect on the mix of sales at the major automakers. Nearly two-thirds of vehicles sold in October by Toyota, for example, were pickups, SUVs and crossovers.\n\nThe Japanese automaker known for its stalwart sedans is increasingly becoming an SUV and truck brand in the U.S.\n\nOther automakers have chosen to become one. Ford, for example, recently announced it would discontinue most of its passenger cars. And Fiat Chrysler has already done so.\n\nBut there's at least one car that's bucking the trend.\n\nAnd it's No. 1 on our list of the hottest vehicles in the U.S. in October. To be sure, this list is not based purely on volume. If it was, the Ford F-series pickup would always be No. 1 since it's the industry's perennial best-seller.\n\nInstead, this list is based on a rather subjective but analytical assessment of sales volume, buzz and momentum:\n\n1. Tesla Model 3\n\nIt's getting harder to deny that the Tesla Model 3 is become a disruptive force in the auto industry.\n\nWhile Tesla does not report sales on a monthly basis, the company sold 55,840 Model 3 cars in the third quarter, which covered July, August and September.\n\nWith only three models for sale, Tesla outsold luxury rival Mercedes-Benz in the third quarter in the U.S.\n\nDuring that period, the Model 3 electric sedan was the third-best-selling car in the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said.\n\nWith the average price starting at $49,000 in the third quarter, that's stunning.\n\nMore Money: Rising interest rates and prices hurt October auto sales, with SUVs still faring better than cars\n\nMore Money: Starbucks unveils 3 new holiday pastries, reusable plastic holiday cup\n\nMore Money: J.C.

Durkin has been on paid administrative leave since August, following the death of a player who collapsed during practice and an investigation of bullying by the Maryland coaching staff. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 The chairman of the University System of Maryland board of regents has resigned following the furor over the decision to reinstate football coach DJ Durkin.\n\nThe board's decision to reinstate Durkin on Tuesday drew harsh criticism from students, players and state politicians. As a result, University President Wallace Loh fired Durkin on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, board chairman James Brady stepped down from his post.\n\n\"In my estimation, my continued presence on the board will inhibit its ability to move Maryland's higher education agenda forward,\" Brady said in a statement. \"And I have no interest in serving as a distraction from that important work.\"\n\nAfter reviewing external reports on the death of offensive lineman Jordan McNair and the culture of the program, the board decided to reinstate Durkin and retain athletic director Damon Evans.\n\nMcNair collapsed on the practice field and died two weeks later of heatstroke. Durkin was put on administrative leave in August and, following the board's recommendation, returned for one day.\n\n\"I understand that reasonable people could come to other conclusions,\" Brady said. \"And even among our board, some did.\"\n\nThe backlash from the decision was overwhelming.\n\n\"I respect the many people \u2014 including elected leaders, members of the public and members of the board \u2014 who disagreed with the recommendations a majority of this board ultimately made,\" Brady said. \"These were difficult decisions, based on information included in reports stemming from two investigations and a great deal of thought and deliberation.\"\n\nDuring the news conference announcing Durkin's reinstatement, Loh said he would retire in June 2019, a surprise development.\n\nReacting to Brady's resignation, Senator Jim Rosapepe (D, College Park) said in a statement: \"I've known Jim Brady for more than 20 years. He's a good man who wants the best for our state. He and his colleagues of the USM Board of Regents made a major mistake this week and he recognized it and acted to help correct it.\n\n\"Now Dr. Loh needs to act. He needs to announce that he is not retiring next year and will work with the regents and with the university community to fix the problems in the athletic department and continue the academic and economic progress which the university has made under his leadership.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, Gov. Larry Hogan said he intended to investigate the board's decision to bring back Durkin after next week's gubernatorial election.\n\nAfter Brady's announcement, Hogan's office issued a statement that read: \"Governor Hogan thanks Mr. Brady for his service on the University System of Maryland Board of Regents, as well as his many years of distinguished public service under three governors of both parties. The governor believes that the university system must move forward in an open and transparent manner to restore public trust in Maryland's flagship university.\"\n\nUnderstanding this, the board announced that it would be open to a review.\n\nIn a statement, the USM board of regents said: \"The board has ... heard from many, including Governor Hogan, members of the legislature, who strongly disagreed with the recommendations that were shared Tuesday. The board deeply respects the views of Maryland's elected leaders and will participate in any process they request.'\n\nIn response to media coverage of McNair's death, a commission that reaffirmed the university's accreditation last year requested more information about the athletic program, so it can make a decision at a meeting later this month about potential action.\n\nThe Middle States Commission on Higher Education could decide to take no action, issue a warning, put the university on probation or remove accreditation, said Brian Kirschner, a spokesman for the commission.\n\n___\n\nAP Writer Brian Witte in Annapolis contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Oct. 13) AP\n\nOffshore wind turbines. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The political battle on climate change is shifting from the nation's capital to ballot boxes thousands of miles away.\n\nTuesday, voters in nine states \u2013 all in the South and West \u2013 will determine the fate of potentially far-reaching environmental measures, including whether to curb greenhouse gas emissions (Washington), increase the use of renewable fuels (Arizona, Nevada) or ban offshore oil drilling (Florida).\n\nThere are ballot initiatives to increase spending on land preservation (Georgia, California), protect wildlife habitats (Alaska), limit fracking (Colorado) and restrict mining (Montana).\n\nPresident Donald Trump's aggressive effort to roll back the broad environmental program pursued by President Barack Obama has activists looking outside the Beltway for solutions to global warming, increased pollution and habitat erosion, said Megan Mullin, an associate professor of Environmental Politics at Duke University.\n\nMore: Colorado election: What to know about Proposition 112, proposed oil and gas setbacks\n\nMore: Bans on offshore oil drilling and vaping at work in same amendment\n\nMore: Clean-energy ballot measure Prop. 127 trailing, Arizona Republic poll finds\n\n\"As states take up the slack in environmental policymaking, it makes sense that environmental groups would pay more attention to what happens in state elections,\" she said. \"We see it (not only) in the climate change space in the absence of federal policy action but in other environmental areas as well.\"\n\nTrying to slow down Trump's deregulatory efforts, environmental groups led by the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) contributed millions to Democratic congressional candidates around the country in hopes of capturing enough seats to wrest the House of Representatives from Republican control.\n\nIn the short term, the most fruitful gains for environmentalists could come by electing governors and other candidates for state office pushing green agendas and winning ballot fights at the state level. To that end, LCV and its local partners have spent nearly $40 million on state candidates and ballot initiatives around the country this election cycle.\n\n\"It\u2019s an opportunity to actually move forward on policies that cut carbon pollution, increase renewable energy, promote and protect clean water and clean air,\" said Pete Maysmith, lead strategist for the LCV Victory Fund.\n\nAs a result of Washington's inaction, billionaire climate change activists, including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Trump impeachment advocate Tom Steyer, helped finance state ballot initiatives around the country.\n\nBoth Gates and Bloomberg contributed $1 million, joining LCV and the Nature Conservancy to boost passage of a first-of-its-kind ballot measure in Washington state that would cut climate-damaging carbon emissions significantly over the next 30 years.\n\nEnvironmental activist Tom Steyer speaks during a USA TODAY interview Sept. 20, 2016, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nOpponents have spent even more, led by several large petroleum companies and the Koch Industries who warned of increased energy prices for consumers, according to state campaign finance records.\n\nSteyer, through his NextGen America organization, has been active in helping ballot measures in Arizona and Nevada that would force utilities to decrease dependence of fossil fuels for cleaner renewable energy sources.\n\nIn May, Michigan's two major utilities committed to increase the power they produce from renewable sources to 25 percent by 2030 after Steyer agreed to end a similar ballot drive.\n\n\"When Trump pulled out of the Paris Treaty (on climate change), the thought was there's nothing we can do to save the planet,\" NextGen spokesman Kevin Mack said. \"And Tom just said, 'Look someone's got to step up and take this thing on, and I'll do it.' \"\n\nHere are some of the most ambitious environmental proposals appearing on state ballots Tuesday:\n\nA solar project located on 118 acres at the State Route 85 Landfill will help Phoenix reach its target of using renewable energy for 15 percent of its power needs by 2025. (Photo: John Samora/The Republic)\n\nWashington\n\nInitiative 1631 would impose a fee on sources of greenhouse gas emissions and \"use the revenue to reduce pollution, promote clean energy, and address climate impacts, under oversight of a public board.\"\n\nThe state is trying to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 \u2013 and half of 1990 levels by 2050 \u2013 by raising the cost of fossil fuels sold or used within the state and electricity generated within or imported into the state.\n\nProponents said that would have the double benefit of encouraging consumers to use cleaner fuel while raising money for efforts to develop alternative energy.\n\nOpponents said small businesses and consumers would shoulder the bulk of the added costs ($2.3 billion during the first five years) while several of the state's largest polluters would be exempt.\n\nArizona\n\nArizona's Proposition 127 would require 50 percent of the retail energy sales of these utilities to come from certain types of renewable energy by 2030.\n\nThe plan calls for increasing the use of renewable energy from 8 percent this year to 15 percent in 2025, and it's not written into the state Constitution, so regulators have flexibility in offering waivers should any utility need one.\n\nProposition 127 is widely opposed by utilities such as Arizona Public Service and a variety of groups \u2013 including a number of rural officials \u2013 concerned it would raise electric bills. APS' parent company, Pinnacle West Capital, poured millions into the campaign to counteract the millions NextGen America spent on the race.\n\n\"Experts predict the typical Arizona family will pay an extra $1,000 per year in utility bills under Prop 127,\" according to Pinnacle-backed Arizonans for Affordable Electricity. \"Small businesses will pay thousands more. Seniors, low-income families and other vulnerable Arizonans will be hardest hit.\"\n\nColorado\n\nProposition 112 on Colorado's ballot would drastically limit the available areas for oil and gas exploration by redefining where it's permitted.\n\nSuch activity can occur as close as 500 feet to an occupied building and \"vulnerable area,\" such as a playground, a reservoir, a public park or a river. This ballot proposal would impose a 2,500-foot buffer.\n\nSupporters of the proposal said it would protect Colorado's natural resources as well as the health and safety of residents who sometimes feel overlooked by the industry and its regulators. Opponents said the setback increase would devastate the future of the oil and gas industry, resulting in big tax revenue and job losses.\n\nPolls indicate the proposition has a good chance of passing despite millions spent by the oil and gas industry, which said it would cost as many as 150,000 jobs.\n\nNevada\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nSimilar to Arizona's renewable energy proposal, Nevada's Question 6 would require state electric producers to buy or generate 50 percent of their power from renewable energy sources by 2030 \u2013 up from about 20 percent.\n\nThe effort, like Arizona's, is funded by Steyer. If voters pass it Tuesday, the proposed state constitutional amendment still will have to go back before voters in 2020.\n\nSupporters \u2013 including the Sierra Club, the Nevada Conservation League and Western Resource Advocates \u2013 said the initiative would mean cleaner air, more jobs and cheaper energy.\n\nOpponents said a constitutional mandate dictating energy policy is unnecessary and risky, pointing out Nevada\u2019s renewable energy portfolio is already set to increase to 25 percent by 2025. They used the example of their western neighbor to argue their case.\n\n\"Funny fact: California pays Nevada to accept excess solar energy from their grid glut,\" opponents wrote in the online information booklet issued by Nevada's secretary of state. \"Do we want to become California, paying exorbitant energy bills caused by poor policy?\"\n\nFlorida\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nFlorida voters will decide whether to ban offshore drilling in state waters. They'll also determine whether to ban the use of vapor e-cigarettes in the workplace.\n\nThe two proposals are bundled together as part of Question 9, one of several proposals on the ballot by the state Constitutional Revision Commission. Under state law, the commission has the flexibility to link different issues to a single measure.\n\nIf the measure is approved, it would make permanent the legislative ban on drilling beneath \u201cstate waters\u201d \u2013 9 miles off the western and southern coastlines and at least 3 miles off Florida's east coast. The ban would not apply to federal waters.\n\nThe amendment will need 60 percent of the vote to pass.\n\nGeorgia\n\nVoters will be asked to decide on an amendment to the state constitution that authorizes the state Legislature to divert up to 80 percent of state sales tax collected by sporting goods for \"protecting and preserving conservation land.\"\n\nFor years, advocates have pushed for the proposal known as the Georgia Outdoor Stewardship Amendment because it would raise about $200 million over the next decade to buy and improve parks and trails, without raising taxes.\n\n\"Georgia\u2019s economy and quality of life are directly tied to both the health of our rivers, lakes and streams and the availability and beauty of our outdoor spaces, wildlife habitats and parks,\" according to the Nature Conservancy.\n\nMore: Midterms: Mike Pence, casting himself as the 'Walmart' politician, is a 'secret weapon' for many 2018 candidates\n\nMore: Think millennials are woke?

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Repeating as Super Bowl champions already was a tough task before the Philadelphia Eagles had a mediocre first half.\n\nThe offense was inconsistent, the defense couldn't protect leads in the fourth quarter and injuries were a factor. So the Eagles entered their bye at 4-4 and were second behind Washington (5-2) in the NFC East.\n\nThey have a challenging schedule coming up and it's unlikely they'll win enough games to get a first-round bye if they can even catch the Redskins.\n\nBut help is on the way from the outside and from within.\n\nWide receiver Golden Tate was acquired from Detroit shortly before the NFL's trade deadline, giving Carson Wentz a needed option. The Eagles are averaging only 22.2 points per game, down from 28.6 last year.\n\nRunning back Darren Sproles could be returning for Philadelphia's next game against Dallas after being sidelined since injuring his hamstring in Week 1. Two more players from the group on injured reserve \u2014 receivers Mack Hollins and Mike Wallace and tight end Richard Rodgers \u2014 also will be eligible to come back.\n\n\"We definitely have the pieces and now is the time to get hot going into November with five more division games,\" Tate said. \"We just need to stay on track. I plan on going to the playoffs and playing a few more.\"\n\nGiving up a third-round pick for Tate, who is in the final season of his contract, was a risky move. It shows the organization believes the team is still a Super Bowl contender despite the so-so record.\n\n\"We have a lot of confidence in our players and in our coaching staff,\" personnel boss Howie Roseman said. \"Has everything gone exactly the way we thought this year? No. I don't think any season does.\n\n\"But we think we have a really good football team and we are adding a really good player. We are going to keep our foot on the gas. We are not going to sit on our hands.\"\n\nWentz was one of the positives in the first two months. He has been mostly excellent since missing the first two games while recovering from knee surgery that forced him to miss the playoffs. However, the offense had other issues.\n\nRunning back Jay Ajayi tore his ACL, wideout Alshon Jeffery missed the first three games and bookend tackles Jason Peters and Lane Johnson are banged-up and didn't play up to their high standards.\n\n\"That week off is huge both for people's minds and their bodies to just really heal up, get away from the game for a couple days and everything, get your mind right so we can come back and make this run,\" Wentz said.\n\nTate could help the offense get in sync. He has more time to learn the playbook because the team is on a break.\n\n\"I want to do whatever's going to help this team win,\" Tate said. \"When the ball is in my hand, I want to be able to make a play.\"\n\nTate has made plenty of plays throughout his 8\u00bd seasons in the league. He has more yards after catch (3,910) than anyone else since 2010. He gives coach Doug Pederson flexibility to move guys around and perhaps put Nelson Agholor back in the slot where he thrived in 2017.\n\n\"He's a tremendously productive player,\" Roseman said. \"His run-after-the-catch numbers are phenomenal. We're really excited to get him.\"\n\nThe Eagles are now better equipped to win shootouts if their defense doesn't perform up to expectations. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz's unit struggled against the pass and allowed several fourth-down conversions in important situations in a couple of losses when a stop would've given the team a win.\n\n\"We have to score more points,\" Pederson said. \"We have to get better. Hopefully we get some guys back healthy. We know our division. We have five division (games) in the next eight weeks, so that's a challenge, but everything is right in front of us.\"\n\nSome of the issues on defense have been surprising. The line was supposed to be a major strength, but the front four isn't getting enough pressure. Brandon Graham only has 1\u00bd sacks and Derek Barnett had season-ending shoulder surgery.\n\nThe secondary has been a problem, too. Safety Rodney McLeod went down with a knee injury and starting cornerbacks Jalen Mills and Ronald Darby have given up too many big plays.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Julian Love can't wait to get to Ryan Field.\n\nThe fact that the junior cornerback for No. 3 Notre Dame played his high school football at Nazareth Catholic Academy in suburban Chicago, about 30 miles from the Northwestern campus in Evanston, has something to do with it.\n\n\"It was a school I really considered until Notre Dame came into the picture,\" Love said. \"I have a lot of respect for Northwestern \u2014 they do a good job over there \u2014 but (playing at) Notre Dame has always been a dream of mine.\"\n\nThe fact that Northwestern, the surprise leader of the Big Ten's West Division, likes to throw the football will make Love's homecoming much more interesting, too.\n\nA week ago, the Fighting Irish (8-0, No. 4 CFP) came out of a bye week and beat Navy 44-22 in a game that saw the Midshipmen attempt just 12 passes. That's a long day with a lot of run support defense for a talented cornerback like Love.\n\n\"With the bye week, it's felt like we haven't played a real offense in a long time,\" Love chuckled. \"Real as in normal offensive schemes. A normal offense. Yeah, I'm very happy.\"\n\nLove, who has three fumble recoveries and an interception this season, was limited to two solo tackles (giving him 26 for the season) against Navy. A first-team member of the Associated Press midseason All-America defensive team, Notre Dame's career leader with 35 passes broken up (12 this season) was even victimized when 6-foot-5, 220-pound wide receiver Mychal Cooper outleaped the 5-foot-11 Love for a 34-yard reception.\n\nLove, of course, is more familiar doing the stealing. Last season, he returned interceptions for touchdowns against Michigan State and North Carolina State, and this season he had a 42-yard fumble return for a touchdown in Notre Dame's 45-23 victory at Virginia Tech.\n\nThe Wildcats (5-3, 5-1 Big Ten) have won four straight and have their sights set on the conference title game. Love is looking forward to going up against Clayton Thorson, Northwestern's senior quarterback who has completed nearly 61 percent of his passes for 2,072 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\n\"(Thorson) trusts his receivers and has a big arm,\" Love said. \"He has the capability of making plays.\"\n\nBut then, so does Love, who plays as hard in practice as he plays in games.\n\n\"I've said this before many times \u2014 going up against Julian every day just makes me a better player,\" said 6-foot-4 wide receiver Miles Boykin, another Irish player from suburban Chicago who played summer 7-on-7 football with Love and Northwestern wide receiver Flynn Nagel.\n\n\"Obviously, he's athletic; obviously, he's fast,\" Boykin said. \"But the thing everyone overlooks is how smart he is. I mean, I could line up my feet a certain way against Julian, and he could tell me the three routes I might run.\"\n\nQuarterback Ian Book sees the talents, too.\n\n\"Julian is always in the right spot and has a knack for the ball,\" he said. \"I think it is great for our offense to go against him every day.\"\n\nCoach Brian Kelly had to have a heart-to-heart conversation with Love this spring when he thought his cornerback was trying too hard.\n\n\"The conversation I had with Julian is that he didn't have to make those plays \u2014 he needed to just continue to evolve and strengthen his skill set,\" Kelly said. \"I think he's done that this year. He doesn't have to be out there making interceptions to be considered one of the top corners in the country.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

These top-rated noise-cancelling headphones can, at the very least, give you a respite of peace and quiet whether you're on a long family road trip or stuck in a crowded airport on a long layover. Yes, these headphones are pricey but don't let the sticker price dissuade you from moving forward: the true-silence noise cancellation capability and unmatched comfort of these Bose headphones makes them worth the investment.\n\nGet the Bose QuietComfort 35 noice-cancelling headphones on Amazon for $270\n\n6. For the friend who's always cold: A jumbo, super-soft blanket scarf\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Blanket scarf (Photo: Amazon)\n\nI won't travel without my huge(ly versatile) blanket scarf. At its most simple, it's a cozy, cute accessory. It can also act wonderfully as a blanket, a pillow, an eye mask, a cushion for your back, even a makeshift umbrella in a pinch. The key to a good blanket scarf is high-quality, lightweight material, and size.\n\nThis one is made of super-soft acrylic and measures 55\" x 55\", which is about half the size of a twin blanket. Whether you wear it as a shawl while exploring a new town or jam it under your head as you catch some Zzz's, a blanket scarf should always make it into your suitcase.\n\nGet the Dimore Blanket Tartan Scarf on Amazon for $14\n\n7. For the one who's always hydrating: A well-designed CamelBak water bottle\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: CamelBak Chute water bottle (Photo: Camelbak / Instagram)\n\nIt's so important to bring your own water bottle while traveling. First off, who has the kind of dispensable income to shell out $5 for a tiny bottle of water?! Secondly, fresh water isn't always readily available and hydration is crucial: becoming dehydrated on hectic travel days will only make you feel like a cranky garbage can.\n\nThis CamelBak Chute water bottle is one of those simple yet brilliantly designed products that makes life so much easier. It holds a ton of water yet easily fits in cup holders, and its spout is large enough to get a good sip without spilling all over yourself on bumpy car rides. Another win: The threads of the screw-top are on the inside of the spout, which prevents water from dipping onto your chin or shirt.\n\nGet the CamelBak Chute Mag Water Bottle on Amazon for $14\n\n8. For the bookworm: The Kindle Paperwhite\n\nPaperwhite (Photo: Reviewed.com / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWhether it's a long flight or a long hike, traveling is a great time to unplug and catch up on your reading. But thanks to our favorite e-reader, the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, you don't have to lug around even one hard copy. The Paperwhite gives you thousands of books at your fingertips, has an adjustable backlight, and excellent battery life that lasts about three weeks on a single charge. The best part? This new and improved version is lightweight and waterproof, so feel free to read in the tub, on the boat, in the pool, etc. The opportunities are endless.\n\nGet the Kindle Paperwhite on Amazon for $130\n\n9. For the one who could use some quick R&R: A refreshing facial mist\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Caudalie Grape Water (Photo: Sephora / Instagram)\n\nA long day on a plane, like a long day hiking or exploring a new town, can leave you in desperate need of a refresh. Whether your skin is actually dry or you just need a refreshing boost, Caudalie's Grape Water is your answer. The organic formula is extracted from grapes in Bordeaux and has the power to both increase hydration and reduce sensitivity.\n\n\"Our entire Sephora Pro Team is obsessed with this because we realize that it takes away redness in the skin,\" says Helen Phillips, Sephora Pro Artist. Thanks to its moisturizing polysaccharides, mineral salts, and potassium, the formula can moisturize, calm sensitive skin, reduce redness, and rehydrate after a particularly long day. And at 2.5 ounces, it's TSA-friendly to boot.\n\nGet Caudalie Grape Water Facial Mist at Sephora for $10\n\n10. For the backpacker: A versatile, ergonomic Osprey backpack\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Osprey Porter 46 backpack (Photo: Osprey / Instagram)\n\nI wish I could write a love letter to my Osprey backpack. I purchased the Porter 46 prior to a three-month backpacking excursion, and though it's been beaten up on many hikes and trips since, it's still comfortable as ever. The 46-liter pack is acceptable as a carry-on, though I've also shoved it beneath the seat in front of me on stingy airlines, thanks to its very effective compression straps.\n\nThis backpack is even perfect for long trips since it flips open like a suitcase, and the padded shoulder straps feel plush and high-quality. Its adjustable support straps made easy work of carrying three months' worth of belongings on my back. I'd buy it a hundred times over.\n\nGet the Osprey Porter 46 backpack at L.L. Bean for $140\n\n11. For the one who uses their phone for everything: Anker PowerCore Portable Charger\n\nThe 26,800mAh-sized Anker PowerCore is a convenient, high-capacity charger, but not as good of a value as the RavPower Turbo Series. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin)\n\nTravelers use their phones for everything as they navigate a new locale. It can act as your compass on a hike, a resource to find the best dinner spot around, a better camera than your DSLR, a navigational system for new terrain, a flashlight in the middle of the night, and so much more. I guess it should come as no surprise that sometimes we look down to see a draining battery alert at 10:30 a.m. That's why a great external phone charger can be invaluable for travelers.\n\nThis is one of our favorites because it has three USB ports (including one for Quick Charge) and holds enough to power to quickly re-juice a dead iPhone three times. So you don't have to skimp on your phone usage while waiting for a flight in fear of a declining battery.\n\nGet the Anker PowerCore 26800mAh portable charger on Amazon for $66\n\n12. For the one who'd lose their head if it wasn't attached: Tile Trackers\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Tile tracker (Photo: Amazon)\n\nIf your pal often gets paged to security to reclaim their forgotten belongings, or has had to ask the owner of a bar to turn the lights on to find her phone during a night out (you know who you are), for the sake of everyone in your friend group, consider getting them a Tile tracker.\n\nWe love the Tile, a small tracking device that you can attach to your most important\u2014or most often forgotten\u2014personal items (think: keys, wallet, purse, luggage, laptop bike, etc.) You can use an app on your phone to track your Tiles\u2014but you can also use the Tile to track your phone if (read: when) you lose it. One main user gripe has been that its battery life gives out after a year\u2014but luckily, Tile just released replaceable batteries for these little life savers.\n\nGet four Tile trackers on Amazon for $60\n\n13. For the one who can't pack light: The Away Large Suitcase\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: The Away Large luggage (Photo: Away / Instagram)\n\nWhether you need to transport medication or an abundance of shoes, or you're just headed for an extra-long vacation, sometimes it's impossible to jam everything you need into a carry-on sized piece of luggage. That's why it's important to have the best checked luggage money can buy.\n\nThe Away Large's tough yet flexible polycarbonate shell saves your suitcase's contents from being crushed, comes in a wide variety of colors, and is resistant to scuffs and dirt. Inside, you'll find about 100 liters of packing space, mesh pockets, and a clip-in compression panel to hold two weeks' worth of clothing (and a ton of souvenirs), as well a laundry bag and a combination lock.\n\nGet the The Away Large suitcase at Away for $295\n\n14. For the one who can't sleep on planes: A cozy, supportive wrap neck pillow\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Huzi neck pillow (Photo: Amazon)\n\nI find sleeping on an airplane near-impossible. The conditions have to be perfect: a window seat, a dark, warm cabin, and preferably an empty middle seat. Even so, I'll lurch awake as soon as my head lulls to the side (or cringe if I slump onto my seat mate). Allegedly, this scarf neck pillow can convert anyone into a bonafide plane sleeper.\n\nBetter than any U-shaped neck pillow, the looped Huzi neck pillow has an infinity design, so there is support at every angle. The flexible design also makes it possible to fold it into a traditional pillow, finagle it into a sleep mask, or prop it up as a back cushion. It's a must for anyone who values their beauty rest.\n\nGet the Huzi neck pillow on Amazon for $36\n\n15. For the safety-first type: A TSA-approved travel lock\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: TSA-approved lock (Photo: Amazon)\n\nLocking up your belongings might not be necessary for flying, but a good luggage lock can be crucially important\u2014and offer peace of mind\u2014for travelers staying in shared homes, hostels, or the like. This weatherproof wire lock has a lifetime warranty, and is TSA-approved: that means it can be unlocked and then relocked by TSA agents without having to break the padlock. With 2,000 reviews and an average 4.4 star rating, it's a favorite among Amazon customers.\n\nGet the TravelMore TSA-approved Travel Lock on Amazon for $6\n\n16. For the germaphobe: Cozy (and hygienic) Muk Luk slippers\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Muk Luks ballerina slippers (Photo: Target)\n\nSlippers are peak cozy and can help transform a mundane hotel stay into feeling more like a luxe spa getaway. However, beyond coziness, it's worth noting that hotels are pretty disgusting: those ubiquitous carpets are often dark and patterned to disguise stains, dirt, and grime. That's why it's always prudent to wear house shoes when you're on an overnight trip.\n\nThese ballerina-style slippers are lined with plush faux fur and have non-slip rubberized soles to prevent sliding on hardwood and tile. Plus, since they don't have a stiff sole, you can roll them up and stuff them in a side compartment of your luggage. They take up almost no room, and are so comfortable you'll probably forget you're wearing them for hygienic reasons.\n\nGet Muk Luks Ballerina Slippers at Target for $12\n\n17. For the Type-A traveler: A holds-everything travel wallet\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Passport wallet (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThis slim envelope wallet holds all the travel essentials, making it perfect for the friend who loves to keep their ducks in a row. It has designated pockets and pouches for pretty much everything you could think of: your passport, boarding passes, credit cards and IDs, cell phone, keys, pens, and a zippered pocket for money and coins. Bonus: It even includes an RFID blocking shield to prevent identity theft, and it comes in over 30 colors, from classic black to bold coral. To avoid tapping into your Type-A friend's neuroses, consider slipping a Tile tracker in there, too.\n\nGet the Zoppen Multi-Purpose Travel Wallet on Amazon for $16\n\n18. For the overpacker: A lightweight digital luggage scale\n\nDr. Meter (Photo: Reviewed / Seamus Bellamy)\n\nI have a friend who always gets stuck paying last-minute bag overage fees at the airport. \"My scale said 48 pounds!\" she always exclaims to an unimpressed TSA agent who slaps her overweight bag with a \"heavy\" sticker and a $25 charge. Great as she is otherwise, don't be like my friend: invest in a luggage scale.\n\nThis one is the best we've ever tested, in part because to use it, you simply turn it on, attach it to the handle of your luggage, and lift. Since it only weighs about 3 ounces, you\u2019ll never even notice it in your bag until you need it. And, unlike your scale at home, it will accurately measure all weight within a few decimal places.\n\nGet the Dr. Meter Digital Luggage Scale on Amazon for $9\n\n19. For the souvenir addict: A compact reusable tote\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Flip & Tumble reusable tote (Photo: Amazon)\n\nMaybe it seems feasible to stuff all of your belongings into a backpack or carry-on, but where do you put all of the clothes uh, I mean, souvenirs, you accrue on a trip? Easy answer: a flimsy, roomy tote that folds down into nothing. This one has a 4.7 star rating and is made of a stretchy, durable nylon/spandex blend, yet can hold up to 35 pounds.\n\nIts single strap has a non-slip pad to keep the bag from slipping off your shoulder while you juggle your other luggage. And if you don't end up using it, the bag folds down into a convenient 3-inch ball, about the size of a peach. It's a no-brainer.\n\nGet the Flip & Tumble Reusable Tote on Amazon for $12\n\n20. For the one who needs a full 8 hours: An award-winning deep-sleep mask\n\nMe (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you've ever been stuck waking up with the sun thanks to a room with sheer curtains, or if you've had a long travel day where the sun's already up yet you know you should be sleeping, you know the importance of a good sleep mask.\n\nThis mask is the best we've tested because it feels like having personal blackout curtains for your eyes and it won\u2019t fall off in the middle of the night, thanks to its adjustable Velcro strap. The contoured design doesn\u2019t put pressure on eyes, so you can actually blink while wearing it, which is great for those mid-day travel naps. You'll wake up well-rested (and in complete darkness).\n\nGet the Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask on Amazon for $16\n\n21. For the Euro-tripper: A well-made European plug adapter\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: European plug adapter (Photo: Amazon)\n\nNo, this is not a glamorous gift. Yet it's also one of the best gifts I've ever received. In my experience, European plug adapters can be flimsy and poorly made, and are often susceptible to short circuiting\u2014at worst leaving your appliances fried, and at best, leaving you without power in a foreign country. But this handy adapter is well-made and sturdy. Its slim design won't block other outlets, yet offers two ports to allow you to plug in two electrical devices at once. I buy it for all of my friends before they head abroad.\n\nGet the OREI European Plug Adapter on Amazon for $6\n\n22. For the beauty- and skincare-lover: A Sephora Play! beauty subscription\n\nSephora November (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nLugging around the full-sized versions of your favorite skincare and beauty products on a trip is just unnecessary. However, you don't have to sacrifice quality and hit the drugstore to stock up trial-sized shampoos, conditioners, lotions, and yes, even makeup.\n\nSephora's Play! box is our favorite monthly beauty subscription service because it's filled with high-quality samples of the store's cult-favorite brands that are curated to match your preferences, lifestyle, and interests. Each month, you'll get five sample-sized luxury products (from designer mascara to high-end face serum) at a great price\u2014and at the perfect size for tossing into your carry-on.\n\nGet Sephora Play! Beauty Subscription Box at Sephora for $10\n\n23. For the one who will never check luggage: The best carry-on suitcase\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Samsonite MightLight (Photo: Samsonite / Instagram)\n\nIt's time we all admit that checking bags is kind of the worst. Between the financial burden of exorbitant checked bag fees, the possibility of losing your bag in transit, and the frustrating amount time it takes to wait for your luggage to clunk down the carousel after a long flight, it's at best, annoying, and at worst, a nightmare to check bags.\n\nLuckily, this Samsonite bag is a TSA-approved carry-on that will fit everything you need for a week-long trip\u2014and it's the best carry-on luggage you can buy. Its 360-degree wheels and sturdy handles make maneuvering this thing through crowded airports a breeze, and it features 2600 cubic inches of packing space with self-healing zippered mesh and water-resistant compartments. It strikes the perfect balance of affordability, features, and build quality.\n\nGet the Samsonite Mightlight 2 Softside Spinner 21 on Amazon for $140\n\n24. For the journaler: A travel journal for the curious-minded\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: I Was Here travel journal (Photo: Amazon)\n\nAs great as a classic Moleskine notebook is, this travel-centric journal is ideal for any creative traveler. It's a colorfully illustrated journal that encourages readers to explore the easily overlooked, the mistakenly mundane, and the everyday details. Some examples: \"have a local draw you a map to their favorite place in their neighborhood,\" and, \"for one day, shoot all photos from hip height.\"\n\nThere are more unique journeys that can be taken in any city, with plenty of space to record discoveries, addresses, itineraries, reviews, and tips from locals. There's even a pocket for collecting memorabilia. It's great for anyone who's ready to step out of their comfort zone.\n\nGet I Was Here: A Travel Journal for the Curious Minded on Amazon for $15\n\n25. For the friend who has everything: An Airbnb gift card\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Airbnb gift card (Photo: AirBnB)\n\nYou know your friend likes traveling\u2014you just don't know what else they could possibly need in their arsenal.

The Bengals missed out on the playoffs again last season because their offense ranked last in the league. At the midpoint this year, they face another daunting challenge: a defense that\u2019s historically bad. (AP Photo/Gary Landers, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Off to a historically bad start on offense, the Bengals fired their coordinator after only two games last season and got better results the rest of the way, though not good enough to make the playoffs.\n\nThey overhauled the NFL's worst offense in the offseason by firing the line coach, trading for a tackle and drafting a center in the first round.\n\nThat part has worked. The offensive improvement is part of the reason Cincinnati is 5-3 at its bye, one of nine teams with so many wins.\n\nNow, the Bengals have another huge problem to fix if they're going to reach the playoffs for the first time in three years.\n\nThis time, it's a historically bad defense .\n\nCincinnati has allowed the most yards and points in the league. The Bengals have given up 500 yards in back-to-back games for the first time in their history. If their current track holds, they would become only the second team in NFL history to allow more than 7,000 yards in a season.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we can do better,\" cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said. \"I know we can.\"\n\nThey'll have to play a lot better on defense if they want to overtake Pittsburgh (4-2-1) and win the division.\n\nThe Bengals installed a new defense under first-year coordinator Teryl Austin. They also continued a youth movement on defense, fielding the youngest team in coach Marvin Lewis' 16 seasons.\n\nInjuries have played a role, too.\n\nSo has the schedule, with Cincinnati facing some of the league's top offenses \u2014 No. 1 Tampa Bay, No. 3 Kansas City, No. 4 Pittsburgh, No. 7 Atlanta. The Bengals face No. 8 New Orleans coming out of their bye.\n\n\"The NFL wants more yards, more scoring, and they are getting it,\" Austin said. \"A lot of it has to do with there are a lot of good quarterbacks, a lot of good receivers, and it's been opened up. It's like fast-break basketball. That makes it tough.\"\n\nThe bye could help with some healing. Cornerback Darqueze Dennard has been sidelined with a shoulder injury the past two games. Linebacker Nick Vigil is out with a sprained knee. Linebacker Vontaze Burfict sat out a win over Tampa Bay with a hip injury. Kirkpatrick has been limited by an Achilles injury. Pass rush specialist Carl Lawson tore his ACL. Several others have been in-and-out with various problems, hurting the consistency.\n\n\"This has been a challenge in terms of the amount of injuries,\" Austin said.\n\nThe offense also is looking to get several key players back after the bye. Running back Giovani Bernard has been sidelined by a knee injury for the past four games.\n\nRookie center Billy Price is practicing after suffering a partially torn ligament in his right foot during the second game. Tight end Tyler Kroft (foot) and receiver John Ross (groin) also have missed time, contributing to problems on an offense that's better than last year but still has issues and ranks 23rd in yards.\n\nDuring a 37-34 win over the Buccaneers on Sunday, the offense managed only 95 yards in the second half and had four consecutive drives that failed to get a first down, helping Tampa Bay rally late .\n\n\"That is where it's disappointing,\" quarterback Andy Dalton said. \"Offensively, we didn't play the same way we did in the first half and we weren't getting first downs. We had way too many three-and-out drives, and in that way it's disappointing.\"\n\nDespite their flaws, the Bengals have stayed above .500 by pulling out games at the end \u2014 something they lacked the past two seasons. The defense has scored four touchdowns, and Dalton has led last-minute drives in two victories. They know they've been fortunate.\n\n\"To be 5-3 right now is huge,\" Dalton said.\n\nFour of their last eight games are against teams that currently have losing records, including two against Cleveland. They also play at Baltimore and finish the season at Pittsburgh, so there's a chance to win the division if they can fix their problems.\n\nThe bye provides a chance to try to figure out ways to tweak the offense and the defense, get some veterans ready to return, and take a breath after a wild first two months.\n\n\"There needs to be some mental health here, too,\" Lewis said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Galvin, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 J.R. Smith has added another tier to the Cavaliers' mounting troubles.\n\nDropped from the rotation and unhappy with his role on a team rebuilding through youth, Smith said Thursday that he wants to be traded. The enigmatic guard said he hasn't formally requested a trade by Cleveland's front office because the Cavs are already aware of his feelings.\n\n\"They know,\" Smith said following shootaround. \"They don't want me, so they obviously know.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old Smith said he was told earlier this season that the Cavs would be focused on playing their younger players to develop them for the future. Cleveland's back to being an also-ran in the Eastern Conference following LeBron James' departure this summer as a free agent.\n\nSmith didn't play in Tuesday night's win over Atlanta, the Cavs' first game since coach Tyronn Lue was fired following a 0-6 start. And while Smith understood that his minutes were going to be drastically reduced \u2014 if not taken away completely \u2014 it's been a challenge for him to stay motivated.\n\n\"It is hard,\" he said. \"Fortunately I got a great crew of people, former teammates, teammates, former coaches, lot of people in my ear that's helped me to go through this process. But at the end of the day, I can't take it out on my teammates. Regardless how hard it is to walk in here and actually put on, as hard as it may sound, to put on a Cavs jersey or shirt, I can't do that to my teammates.\n\n\"I can't do that to the fans.\"\n\nIt's been a tough opening month for the Cavs, who fired Lue and believed they were replacing him with assistant Larry Drew. However, Drew said he doesn't want the 'interim' tag unless he gets some assurance from Cleveland's front office and the sides have not come to an agreement on a restructured contract.\n\nOn top of that, All-Star Kevin Love is expected to miss weeks with a toe injury.\n\nSmith has brought a new challenge, but insists he will be a professional.\n\n\"There's a lot of things that's going on around here that I don't know the answer to and I don't know why it's going on, but it is and I can't control that,\" he said. \"I just worry about what I can control, worry about being a good vet to these young guys who are playing \u2014 cheer for 'em, help 'em as much as they want me to help. Other than that, I'm buying time, I guess.\"\n\nSmith has had a rocky relationship with Cleveland fans, some of whom love his care-free spirit while others still blame him for losing track of the score in the closing seconds of Game 1 in last year's NBA Finals.\n\nSmith, who is just one of three Cavs left from the 2016 title team, said he was given the option to leave the team by Cleveland's front office.\n\n\"They asked me if I wanted to be around the team and if I didn't I could leave and go home and do whatever,\" he said. \"I can't do that to these fans, I can't do it to the city. To come from where I came from, from pretty much nothing to Cleveland and the way the city embraced me, the fans embraced me, the relationship I have with them, I can't do that to them.\n\n\"It's not about me, it's not about who wants me here and who doesn't want me here. For me, it's all about the fans.\"\n\nSmith's pricy contract makes it nearly impossible for the Cavs to trade him now. He's making $14.7 million this season, and his $15.6 million contract for 2019-20 is partially guaranteed for $3.8 million.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nEach week during the season, the USA TODAY Sports college staff (Jace Evans, Paul Myerberg, George Schroeder, Erick Smith and Eddie Timanus) will provide their answers to on an intriguing question from college football.\n\nThe initial College Football Playoff rankings were released Tuesday. With Alabama and LSU playing each other this week, it's likely someone from outside the top four will make the field. Which team has the best chance?\n\nJace Evans\n\nOhio State came in at No. 10 in the first College Football Playoff rankings, but don\u2019t be surprised if the Buckeyes find a way into the top four come December. It\u2019s hard to envision a one-loss Big Ten champion not snagging one of the four bids, and while Michigan presently finds itself five spots higher in the rankings than rival Ohio State, the Buckeyes have a slightly simpler path before hosting \u201cThe Game\u201d in Columbus. As you may have heard, Jim Harbaugh has not beaten Ohio State since he got to Michigan. The Purdue game brought Ohio State\u2019s issues to the surface, but it also made it easy to forget this fact: this is a supremely talented football team led by one of the greatest coaches of all time. The bet is in Urban Meyer \u2013 now 77-9 at Ohio State \u2013 figuring the defense out and riding QB Dwayne Haskins back to the playoff.\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Alabama-LSU highlights jam-packed schedule in Week 10\n\nRIGHT AND WRONG: Analyzing College Football Playoff committee's first rankings\n\nSCENARIOS: College Football Playoff possibilities from the likely to total chaos\n\nPaul Myerberg\n\nNo. 5 Michigan is too easy an answer, since the Wolverines will move into the top four by default should they win this Saturday against No. 14 Penn State. Meanwhile, rival Ohio State needs to show drastic improvement in a handful of key areas before climbing from No. 10 into a national semifinal. So my pick is No. 7 Oklahoma. The Sooners\u2019 schedule is good enough to impress the selection committee as other teams cannibalize each other, capped by a road trip to No. 13 West Virginia and a rematch with one of the Mountaineers, Texas or Iowa State to decide the Big 12. And OU looks the part, especially on offense. I like the Sooners to be there when the committee makes its final call in December.\n\nGeorge Schroeder\n\nThis comes down pretty easily to Michigan or Oklahoma. If Notre Dame loses somewhere along the way, both could easily find their way into the four-team bracket. If Notre Dame goes unbeaten, it could come down to a debate.\n\nEither has to win out, of course. Michigan\u2019s schedule features some tough games. But sandwiched between Penn State this week and Ohio State in Columbus on Nov. 24 are Rutgers and Indiana. Those are wins. (Note also: Michigan\u2019s only loss would be on the road, at Notre Dame \u2013 a team in the playoff bracket.)\n\nFor Oklahoma, meanwhile, only Kansas is a gimme. The Sooners have road games against Texas Tech and West Virginia and Bedlam vs. Oklahoma State at home. And then, there\u2019s a Big 12 championship game \u2013 which could conceivably be a rematch, one week later, with West Virginia.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult closing stretch, although if Kyler Murray and the offense keep rolling, it seems doable. Oklahoma\u2019s midseason staff change might also factor in. If the defense shows improvement after Mike Stoops\u2019 departure, the committee might view the Sooners as very potent.\n\nWhich resume would the committee like better? How would the eye test figure in? Who knows? But if we want to go deep, this might be important: Both Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione and former Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer (whose son Shane Beamer is an Oklahoma assistant) are recused from discussion and voting when Oklahoma is being considered. If there\u2019s a significant debate, that could loom large.\n\nSo let\u2019s go with the Wolverines.\n\nErick Smith\n\nThe key to this question is that it asks which team has the best chance. It's not about which team is the best. That honor would fall to Georgia. But the Bulldogs have no margin for error and likely must get through Alabama. If it was possible to know LSU would upset the Tide this weekend, then the pick would be different.\n\nBut without a crystal ball, the rankings committee gave us a bit of an insight to their perspective with Ohio State at No. 10, well beyond other contenders. That leaves the Buckeyes a lot of ground to make up even if they beat Michigan along the way to the Big Ten title. Michigan has won in Columbus once this century, so that's a pretty big hill them to climb.\n\nThat leaves Oklahoma, which again appears to be rounding into form after an early loss. A trip to West Virginia could be difficult. And there's a Big 12 title game rematch with someone. But the Sooners look to be on the upward trend unlike the rest of the league and that should get them into the field.\n\nEddie Timanus\n\nThe easy answer is Michigan, since it occupies the first spot outside the top four. The Wolverines have a couple of significant obstacles in their path, however, like this week\u2019s home tilt with Penn State and the small matter of that season-ending trip to Columbus. The Buckeyes have a couple matters to deal with themselves before the Wolverines come calling, but we\u2019ll hedge our bets a little and say whichever Big Ten East contender emerges victorious from the Horseshoe will find its way into the top four.", "", "NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman speaks to the media before the Florida Panthers-Winnipeg Jets game in Helsinki.

It was an emotional moment for Rose, for fans, and for his NBA colleagues. The national media responded by spinning up the redemption narrative for Rose, who was accused of gang rape in 2015. Rose, along with two others, was found not liable in a civil trial. That case is under appeal and will be heard on Nov. 16th.\n\nIn his defense, Rose openly admitted what he had done, said he didn\u2019t even know what the word \u201cconsent\u201d meant, that he and his friends were just being \u201cmen.\u201d\n\nAs Rose finished off Wednesday\u2019s game, many news outlets presented it as a feel-good narrative of an athlete coming back from the brink, speaking not only about the injuries and trades that Rose went through, but obliquely referencing Rose\u2019s sexual assault allegations as a thing that had to be \u201covercome.\u201d\n\nIn the local television broadcast, Timberwolves analyst Jim Petersen tried \u2013 and failed spectacularly \u2013 to address the issue.\n\nWhat a moment for Derrick Rose, fighting back tears after the buzzer in Minnesota \ud83d\ude4f pic.twitter.com/hcPPOKH7i7 \u2014 ESPN (@espn) November 1, 2018\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of stuff going on off the court and I\u2019m not a judge and I\u2019m not a jury and to my estimation he\u2019s not been convicted of anything but what he is\u2014is he plays hard, he is a gutty basketball player.\u201d\n\nThe comments dangerously conflate Rose\u2019s on court success with absolution and personal virtue. By referring to the alleged rape in the same breath as his physical injuries, commentators, writers, reporters all reduced sexual assault allegations as an obstacle to be overcome, and diminish it as just another danger of being a pro athlete. Not only do comments like that normalize sexual violence and prop up a toxic rape culture, they put further pressure on victims who already bear an inordinate burden of proof.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that what Rose accomplished last night was noteworthy, and even worthy of appreciation, but dismissing the rape allegations, or not mentioning them at all, or choosing to hand wave them away as a minor detail, all contribute to a culture that places the on-court accomplishments of athletes above all else, especially their treatment of women.\n\nRose\u2019s case is not unique. He\u2019s just one of many athletes and public figures, like Patrick Kane, Jameis Winston, Ben Roethlisberger, who continue to be celebrated while these parts of their past get swept under the rug. Yes, they were all acquitted or found not guilty, but, as Clinton Yates pointed out in his piece for The Undefeated, \u201cthe justice system, the same one which finds way to exonerate police officers for killing unarmed citizens, isn\u2019t suddenly fool-proof for sexual assault.\u201d\n\nSo how do we talk about athletes like Rose? There\u2019s no specific script and each case is unique, but at the very least, accusations of sexual assault should never be used as a stepping stone in redemption arc. The conversation around Rose last night either totally ignored his history of sexual assault, or used it as a way to prop up a feel good narrative.

He has amassed tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still able to pay all my (non-medical) bills and take care of my family,\u201d Bertanzetti said. \"But they just killed my credit.\"\n\nBertanzetti and other consumers will have more choices when shopping for insurance when the six-week open enrollment period for health plans under the Affordable Care Act begins Thursday.\n\nMillions of consumers buy coverage through the Obamacare marketplace. New rules created by the Trump administration allow more options, including less-expensive, bare-bones plans that lack the consumer protections found in Obamacare insurance.\n\nMore than 8 in 10 consumers who sign up for Affordable Care Act plans receive federal subsidies that offset the monthly costs of their insurance. But those who earn too much to qualify for the subsidies are left to pay the full monthly premiums. For many Americans, those plans are too costly.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration finalized a rule that allows insurers to sell short-term plans that last up to 364 days. The Obama administration limited those plans' terms to 90 days.\n\nThe plans are usually less expensive, but they often don't cover the minimum set of benefits such as prescription drugs, mental health or maternity care that Obamacare plans must cover. And unlike Obamacare plans, they can also exclude or limit coverage based on pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nWhen unveiling the plans, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said they might appeal to temporary contractors and gig-economy workers who don\u2019t get health insurance through a job.\n\nAnother factor that could steer more healthy consumers to these plans: The elimination of the individual mandate.\n\nUnder legislation approved by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, consumers in 2019 who don't get health insurance won't have to pay a penalty.\n\nMost Americans get coverage through an employer or a government insurer such as Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nSome consumers who bought less-expensive, short-term plans paid penalties under the Affordable Care Act because these plans were not considered \"qualified health plans.\"\n\nCalifornia, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey have effectively banned these plans. Another 17 states have imposed stricter limits than the federal government.\n\nStill, the Congressional Budget Office estimates 2 million people will buy them.\n\n'There's a reason why they are cheaper'\n\nChristina Marsh Dalton is an assistant professor of economics at Wake Forest University.\n\nDalton predicts some healthy consumers who buy their own coverage but don\u2019t qualify for ACA subsidies may choose to buy short-term plans.\n\n\u201cThey no longer have to choose between a fine and a plan they don\u2019t need or feel they can\u2019t afford,\u201d Dalton said.\n\nDalton says it\u2019s the consumer\u2019s responsibility to know what they are buying.\n\n\u201cThey are cheaper,\" Dalton said, \"And there\u2019s a reason why they are cheaper.\"\n\nAn April survey of 24 short-term plans by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that 71 percent didn't cover prescription drugs and 62 percent didn't cover substance-abuse treatment.\n\nIn an analysis released this week, Kaiser found that short-term plans charged an average of 54 percent less than Affordable Care Act plans by excluding coverage of preexisting conditions and limiting benefits.\n\nConsumers often don't realize what they're buying.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund analyzed brochures from five companies marketing short-term plans. These plans required customers to fill out a health questionnaire to screen applicants.\n\nThe plans may limit coverage, the fund reported, offering $250 for an ambulance trip that might cost thousands, or $1,000 for a one-day hospital stay that likely would cost far more.\n\nShort-term plans are sold year-round. But experts predict consumers will be bombarded with ads during the six-week Obamacare enrollment period.\n\n\"Consumers are going to get a lot of ads for these plans,\" said Sara Collins, the Commonwealth Fund's vice president of health coverage and access. \"People really need to read the fine print.\"\n\n\"They might be cheaper than other plans. That price will reflect the lack of guaranteed protections.\"\n\nCompanies that sell short-term plans say consumers should be aware of what they are buying.\n\nSean Malia is senior director of carrier relations for eHealth, an online marketplace that facilitates the sale of short-term plans and other types of insurance.\n\nMalia says short-term plans were never intended as a replacement for Affordable Care Act plans. He says some consumers buy short-term plans so they aren't uninsured.\n\n\"People who are buying these plans are people who have already determined they can\u2019t afford an Affordable Care Act plan,\" Malia said. \"Therefore, these plans really serve as an alternative to going uninsured as opposed to an alternative to ACA.\"\n\nHe says not all short-term policies are cheap, bare-bones plans. Some provide more robust coverage; they tend to cost more.\n\nA $35,000 kidney stone\n\nBertanzetti, 44, said he chose his policy after contacting and chatting with a HCC Medical sales representative.\n\nHe says the sales representative asked him a series of questions, and then assured him he had chosen the company's best policy.\n\nBertanzetti bought his first plan in late 2015. It was set to expire three days after his snowboarding accident in February 2016.\n\nIn his federal lawsuit filed in Denver, Bertanzetti's attorneys said the insurance company told him that the first claim was denied because he was not eligible for coverage the date of his hospital stay even though his policy had not expired.\n\nThe insurer also said it did not receive information requested from the medical provider, according to the lawyers.\n\nThe insurer also denied coverage for a followup operation to remove plates and screws and clear up a severe infection in his shoulder, claiming it was a pre-existing condition, according to the lawyers.\n\nHCC does not comment on pending litigation, said Doug Busker, the company's vice president of financial planning and analysis and public relations.\n\nIn court papers, the insurer said it acted in good faith, and all claims that were denied or excluded reflected the terms of the plan.\n\nHCC LIfe Insurance agreed this year to pay $5 million to settle with insurance commissioners in 42 states. The settlement followed a multi-state investigation of the company's marketing and sale of short-term health insurance plans and claims handling.\n\nThe company admitted no wrongdoing. The company said it discontinued selling short-term medical insurance in the 42 states, according to the settlement agreement.\n\nBusker said that the settlement did not identify deficiencies in the company's sales, marketing or claims practices.\n\n\"HCC Life and MIS (Medical Insurance Services) agreed to the settlement in order to resolve disputed matters associated with this former line of business and agreed to pay $5 million to the settling states for the examination, administrative costs and compliance,\" Busker wrote in an email.\n\nAttorneys representing Bertanzetti advised consumers to request a policy and review details before signing up for a short-term plan. Attorney Jeffrey Hill said Bertanzetti's policy listed 59 separate exclusions.\n\n\"What they have essentially done, they have built in a very broad set of reasons after the fact to justify not paying the medical bill,\" Hill said. \"That is what the average person does not understand.\"\n\nSome consumers remain optimistic that cheaper, short-term plans will work for them.\n\nChris Barber has bought short-term policies to cover his family in recent years. His current family plan, purchased through eHealth, costs $220 per month and covers himself, his wife and their three children.\n\nBecause the plan has a $2,500 deductible, the family negotiates directly with their pediatrician for routine visits for their kids. The short-term plan would provide protection in the event of a catastrophic event.\n\nThe Fort Worth, Texas, man said the arrangement worked well until August, when a kidney stone landed him in a hospital emergency room. A week later, he had surgery to remove the kidney stone.\n\nNow he has $35,000 in medical bills and he's uncertain whether his insurer, Lifeshield National Insurance, will pay for anything.\n\nLifeshield did not respond to an initial request for comment. A woman who answered a second phone call to Lifeshield told USA TODAY that the insurer would not comment on Barber's case. She declined to identify herself or forward the inquiry to another person.\n\nBarber says the insurer rejected his initial claim, and made him fill out a questionnaire about his medical history. The company also asked him to retrieve detailed medical records and doctors' notes from his providers.\n\n\"They are taking a long time to pay out,\" Barber said. \"We are to the point where they may not honor what they said they would ... We're hoping they do the right thing.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/01/obamacare-enrollment-under-trump-short-term-health-insurance-cheaper-riskier/1830296002/", "", "bad url", "", "'Who's really crazier here, Trump or the mainstream media that give him the attention he seeks to his lies, his bizarre and wacky statements?'\n\nBlame the press (Photo: David Fitzsimmons/The Arizona Star/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nPresident Donald Trump called the \"fake news media\" the \"true enemy of the people,\" the week after bombs were sent to top Democratic officials and CNN, and just a few days after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.\n\nIt's a vicious finger-pointing cycle\n\nBy Elvia Diaz\n\nYou know President Donald Trump is desperate when he goes nuts about militarizing the U.S.- Mexico border to keep out the Central American \"invasion\" and the \"terrorists\" hiding among the migrant caravan. Or when he threatens to ax a constitutional amendment with a stroke of his pen to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of foreigners.\n\nThe president apparently thought the menace of an \"invasion\" and \"terrorists\" wouldn't get enough conservative voters to the polls on Tuesday. He decided to tease America with the idea that he could end \u2014 by executive order \u2014 the birthright citizenship guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nWe in the news media went equally nuts with wall-to-wall coverage of Trump's teaser. Yes, it was just that, a teaser because it'd be nearly impossible for Trump to pull it off.\n\nYet, we fell for it.\n\nWho's really crazier here, Trump or the mainstream media that give him the attention he seeks to his lies, his bizarre and wacky statements?\n\nTalker: 'Megyn Kelly Today' could've taught us about blackface this Halloween\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nAnything about Trump is frustrating. I've advocated scrutinizing each of his words as long as he remains president of the United States. Then, like many Americans, I recoil in disgust as I watch how we \u2014 the news media \u2014 continue to feed his most primitive instincts.\n\nWe\u2019ve been at a crossroads since Trump's election and his incessant attacks on journalists as the \"enemy of the people.\"\n\nOn the one hand, investigative journalists have relentlessly covered the chaotic administration, resulting in special counsel Robert Muller's Russia investigation and high-profile indictments.\n\nJournalists have sounded the alarm on everything from the Muslim ban to the cruel White House policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, which Trump has since rescinded.\n\nOn the other, wall-to-wall coverage of every word he utters and every tweet he posts has deepened America's divide. Americans are angry at journalists, at each other, at the president.\n\nTrump blames the media for that. The media blame him. How and when will this end?\n\nWe are simply the messenger \u2014 nothing more. It pains me at times, but journalists must keep reporting every word the presidents utters and every tweet he posts.\n\nWe must do so responsibly and, yes, we must always call out the lies, the bizarre and the wacky. But we also should not get carried away, lending credence to outlandish claims.\n\nThere is good news in this feud. And that is you \u2014 the voter \u2014 have the power to help restore America's integrity.\n\nDon't be fooled by Trump\u2019s tantrums and distractions.

There are a lot of us who feel this way. If the news media would ever report the good he does, instead of all these opinion pieces they spew, people wouldn\u2019t be so upset. I think he is doing a great job and will vote for him again in 2020.\n\n\u2014 Lisa Alonso\n\nHas anyone considered that the left and right agendas and the media manipulation are the reasons Trump is in office? Never has this nation been more polarized. If we don\u2019t fix things like media bias, team left vs. team blue and start putting term limits to get these corrupted crooks out of office, we may get worse than Trump. I do think Trump is selfish, deceiving and a poor person in general, and I do not like him, but he has done better than many before him.\n\n\u2014 Robert Tomberlin\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThis constant focus to undermine the press has a well-developed strategy to sow doubt and distrust in the media, as they continue to report President Donald Trump's actions. When you hear him at a rally complimenting a congressman for body-slamming a reporter saying, \"He's my kind of guy,\" Trump\u2019s promoting violence. When he continues to attack the news, he sounds like a person blaming his appearance on the mirror.\n\nYou take away our free press and you remove accountability from our leaders.\n\nJames Keough; Palos Heights, Ill.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nDick Meyer, USA TODAY: \"By discrediting the press, President Donald Trump discredits criticism and scrutiny of his administration, character and words. He discredits the idea that truth and facts exist. Many have written that this is the deep, enduring threat that Trumpism poses to democracy. Trump doesn\u2019t only mock the press; he lies to it compulsively and thus to 'the people.' In doing so, he uses another technique swiped from other 20th authoritarian regimes \u2014 The Big Lie.\"\n\nJim Rutenberg, The New York Times: \"By so often putting his words under a microscope, journalists may give the impression to Trump\u2019s supporters and even some undecided voters that they are out to get him. ... In practical terms, then, journalists should ignore Trump\u2019s tactic of using false narratives to divert their attention away from real crises. ... But how long will it take the news media to come up with a more effective way to counter the litany of baseless claims washing through the news cycle?\"\n\nEzra Klein, Vox: \"Trump has always treated his presidency as a reality show, and every good reality show needs a villain. From day one, Trump wanted his villain to be the media. With Democrats basically powerless, the media were the only force powerful enough to make continuing sense of Trump\u2019s aggrieved, oppositional political style. The problem was the media didn\u2019t want to be Trump\u2019s opposition party. The media wanted to cover his presidency. ... Trump\u2019s solution to that problem has been to provoke the media into looking like his opposition by lying in more absurd ways and directly attacking them in more outrageous ways at more and more outrageous times.\"\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/01/donald-trump-fight-news-media-national-divide-talker/1844707002/", "Carly Rae Jepsen gave us major disco vibes at Lollapalooza Saturday.

Over a jaunty marimba beat, Jepsen laments how her lover doesn't want her anymore -- but she's over it by the time the chorus of manic synths rolls around, as she decides to be her own lover instead.\n\nThe music video brilliantly illustrates the song's self-love mantra by showing Jepsen and a host of other characters alone in their respective hotel rooms, as they watch TV, cry, dance, strip down to their underwear and -- in Jepsen's case -- order to-go boxes of expensive shoes.\n\nThe single is Jepsen's first new song since she released \"Cut To The Feeling\" in May 2017.

(Photo: Brace Hemmelgarn, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves guard Derrick Rose had quite the journey to the first 50-point game of his career.\n\nSeven years after he became the youngest player to win the NBA's MVP award and six years since he last averaged more than 20 points per game, Rose delivered one of the more surprising NBA performances in recent memory. The 30-year-old tallied 50 points on 31 shots, nailing four-of-seven three-pointers and shooting 8-11 from the free throw line.\n\nRose put the cherry on top of his career night with two go-ahead buckets in the final minute of the fourth quarter, pushing the Timberwolves to a 128-125 win.\n\nCAREER-HIGH 50 PTS \u2705\n\nGame-Winning Block \u2705\n\nA Night to Remember \u2705\n\n\n\nDerrick Rose lifts the @Timberwolves to victory at home with a historic, emotional performance! #AllEyesNorth#ThisIsWhyWePlaypic.twitter.com/DrysNGIyCy \u2014 NBA (@NBA) November 1, 2018\n\nRose has spent the past two seasons on one-year deals with two different teams and even had to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers last season to consider his future with basketball. Considering his fall from MVP-grace, it is understandable to see why Rose was overcome with emotion on Tuesday night.\n\nInspired by Rose's unexpected performance, here are some of the most surprising 50-point games since the turn of the century.\n\nKobe Bryant ends career with 60-point night at Staples Center\n\nNo stranger to 50-point games, Bryant dazzled us with an 81-point game and seven 50-plus point performances in the span of a month. Yet, his most surprising show of scoring might be his final one, when he said goodbye to the NBA with a 60-point game against the Utah Jazz in April of 2016.\n\nIt had been over seven years since Bryant last scored 50 points in a game, and the season had not been treating him particularly well, either. He was averaging under 17 ppg on just 35 percent shooting.\n\nIt took him 50 shots to get there - the most in an NBA game since the 1960's - but with a go-ahead jumper and a pair of free throws in the final minute of the game, the 37-year-old reached 60 points for just the sixth time in his career. The game put Bryant's name in the record books one last time as the oldest player (37 years, 234 days) to ever score 60 points in a game.\n\n20-year-old Devin Booker goes for 70\n\nFrom the oldest player to drop 60-plus, to the youngest.\n\nOn March 24, 2017, Devin Booker introduced himself to the NBA history books with a coming-out party for the ages: 70-points against the Celtics at Boston's TD Garden. The Phoenix Suns guard had certainly showed promise in his first year and a half in the league, but no one was expecting a game like this. Booker hadn't scored more than 40 points at that time, but put up an astounding 51 points in the second half to give the NBA its first 70-point game in over a decade.\n\nDespite Booker's 70 points, the Suns somehow managed to lose the game, 130-120.\n\nAt 20 years and 145 days old, Booker remains by far the youngest player to ever score 60 points in a game, eclipsing a 23-year-old Michael Jordan.\n\nMo Williams pours in 52 at age 32\n\nAt 32 years old in 2015, Mo Williams had never averaged more than 20 ppg in any year of his career.\n\nThen, on January 13, the 12 year veteran had the best game of his career, tallying 52 points and easily marking a career-high. Before that, Williams had eclipsed the 40-point mark just twice in his career, both times during the 2009 season.\n\nCorey Brewer's 51-point night\n\nA career 8.9 ppg and zero All-Star appearances doesn't necessarily sound like the profile of a 50-point scorer.\n\nYet, in the final days of the 2013-14 regular season, Corey Brewer dropped 51 points on the Houston Rockets, which set a career-high for the journeyman player on the wing.\n\nBrewer had never eclipsed 30 points prior to his career night against the Rockets.\n\n33-year-old Andre Miller scores 52\n\nPlaying for nine different teams, Miller finished his career averaging 12.5 ppg and zero All-Star Game appearances.\n\nHe hadn't scored more than 33 points in over five years, but in January of 2010, Miller (33 years, 317 days old) became the fourth oldest player to score at least 50 points since 2000. The only players older than him - Jordan, Bryant, and Karl Malone - might not have been quite as surprising.\n\nTony Delk catches fire for 53 points\n\nDelk, who played from 1996-2006, averaged over 10 points for a season just twice before he had the night of his basketball life in 2001.\n\nPlaying for the Suns at the time, the guard shot 20-27 from the field and 13-15 from the free throw line en route to a stunning 53-point performance. Delk eclipsed the 50-point plateau without making a single three-pointer.", "", "TENNESSEE (3-4) at DALLAS (3-4)\n\nMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nOPENING LINE \u2014 Cowboys by 3\u00bd\n\nRECORD VS.

(Photo: Guillermo Arias, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThere will seldom, if ever, be as good an example of federal \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d as President Donald Trump\u2019s decision this week to send up to 15,000 troops to the United States-Mexican border.\n\nEven if the impact on the deficit and national debt was not going to be significant (and it will be), this would still qualify as one of the most egregious examples in American history of a federal budget boondoggle.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration so far has not provided any details on the expense of what it is calling \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot,\u201d a much smaller previous effort almost a decade ago cost taxpayers $500 million. That could put the Trump plan at the same level of fiscal infamy as the notorious \u201cbridge to nowhere,\u201d nowhere being an Alaska island with a population of 50. Fifteen years after Congress finally killed it because it was so embarrassing, it is still a punchline for pundits and comedians and the classic definition of waste, fraud and abuse in Washington.\n\nTroop deployment to border is boondoggle\n\nBut Trump\u2019s decision to send troops to the border is destined to overtake that boondoggle bridge as the waste, fraud and abuse joke of all time, because it qualifies in all three categories.\n\nWaste. Deploying the troops now serves no practical purpose whatsoever. Even if the people walking towards the United States were a real threat, and that hasn\u2019t been established in any way, they are still (1) hundreds of miles away, (2) on foot, (3) moving very slowly, (4) multiple weeks from arriving and (5) planning to ask legally and peacefully for asylum rather than invading.\n\nIn addition, there are severe legal restrictions on what the military may dowhile it is at the border that makes it highly unlikely the troops will perform any meaningful tasks.\n\nFraud. Trump allegedly sent the troops because the people walking towards the U.S. posed a danger to the country that required a military response, but the White House has offered no proof at all about this. To the contrary, the only thing we\u2019ve heard is Trump\u2019s unconfirmed statements about a threat, which have been repeatedly contradicted by independent reports.\n\nAbuse. As commander-in-chief, Trump, like every president, has the authority to direct the military. But it\u2019s anything but clear that his authority extends to using the troops for what appear to be not just purely partisan but obviously direct election purposes.\n\nMore: GOP should support work visas. They'd help business, ease caravan problem.\n\nWarning to Trump: Caravan focus could backfire and cost Republicans in the midterms\n\nMigrant caravan won't stop if U.S. cuts off aid to Central America. Don't do it.\n\nTrump is not the first president to send the military to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border. For example,in 2010, Barack Obama sent 1,200 National Guard troops to assist while more traditional border control agents were recruited and trained.\n\nBut there are substantial differences between the two situations.\n\nFirst, Obama\u2019s action came more than five months before the 2010 midterm election and so was decidedly less political. Trump\u2019s order came less than two weeks before Election Day, with early voting under way. \u2014\n\nSecond, Obama\u2019s order was aimed at criminals crossing the border illegally while, by his own admission, Trump wants to stop migrants from legally seeking asylum.\n\nThird, Obama made it clear that the military was there only to support other law enforcement with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. By contrast, Trump\u2019s Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, has said that there are no plans \u201cright now\u201d for the troops to shoot at those walking toward the U.S.\n\nPentagon slush fund for Trump political projects\n\nThe Trump plan to send up to 15,000 troops to the border also qualifies as waste, fraud and abuse because the White House apparently does not plan to ask Congress for the funds for this effort. Instead, it is requiring the Defense Department to use appropriations that were enacted for a completely different purpose. That means DOD will have to shortchange other activities the Pentagon previously told Congress were essential.\n\nThis by itself qualifies as waste, fraud and abuse. It clearly shows the Trump administration doesn\u2019t care about how much time it and Congress spend agreeing on a budget every year. It reveals Trump\u2019s supposedly unbridled support for the military as a fraud, given that he\u2019s so willing to use its budget as a slush fund for his political projects. And it\u2019s a clear abuse of the constitutionally mandated appropriations process.\n\nSomewhere the bridge to nowhere supporters must be smiling. Trump\u2019s troop deployment plan has now replaced their pet project as the epitome of what\u2019s bad about Washington.\n\nStan Collender teaches federal budgeting at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and is the founder of thebudgetguy.blog.

He promised to defend the constitution and unite a bitterly divided populace. Supporters celebrated while his left-wing rival immediately vowed to mount a vigorous opposition. (Oct. 29) AP\n\nUS National Security Adviser John Bolton answers reporter's questions in the press briefing room of the White House in Washington, DC, USA, 03 October 2018. Bolton spoke about Iran, as well as about Palestine, saying the latter is a 'so-called state.' (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA-EFE)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 National Security Adviser John Bolton fully embraced Brazil\u2019s newly elected far-right president on Thursday, calling Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s win a \u201cpositive\u201d sign for the future of Latin America and dubbing him a \u201clike-minded\u201d leader the Trump administration could work with.\n\nBolsonaro has said he supports dictatorship and torture, and he has used harsh rhetoric in talking about homosexuals, women, and minorities. Human-rights advocates and other critics have lamented Bolsonaro\u2019s victory in Brazil\u2019s election on Sunday, fearing he will undermine democracy and civil rights. A former army captain and current congressman, the Brazilian politician will take over as president in January.\n\nIn a speech outlining the Trump administration\u2019s policy toward Latin America, Bolton made no references to Bolsonaro\u2019s incendiary comments or policy positions. Instead, he said the Trump administration looked forward to partnering with him and another newly-elected, right-leaning politician in the region, Ivan Duque of Colombia.\n\n\u201cThe recent elections of like-minded leaders in key countries, including Ivan Duque in Colombia, and last weekend Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, are positive signs for the future of the region, and demonstrate a growing regional commitment to free-market principles, and open, transparent, and accountable governance,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nBolton delivered the speech in Miami at the Freedom Tower, a symbolic building in the heart of downtown Miami where tens of thousands of Cuban refugees were first processed as exiles escaping Castro\u2019s Cuba in the 1960s.\n\nBolton made his remarks just days before the midterm elections. Florida's Latino voters could be pivotal in a bevy of competitive races in the state, including House, Senate, and gubernatorial contests.\n\nWhile praising Brazil and Columbia's incoming leaders, Bolton had harsh words for three other Latin American countries \u2013 Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua \u2013 labeling them a \"troika of tyranny.\"\n\nHe blasted Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel as a brutal dictator who has jailed and tortured opponents. \"In Venezuela and Nicaragua,\" Bolton added, \"desperate autocratic leaders, hell-bent on maintaining their grip on power, have joined their Cuban counterparts in the same oppressive behavior of unjust imprisonment, torture, and murder.\"\n\nCritics blasted Bolton's speech. Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and Obama administration adviser, said in a tweet that Bolton's praise of the incoming Brazilian president put the U.S. \"on the side of racism, misogyny, homophobia, and an aspiring autocrat.\"\n\n\"Troika of Tyranny\" and \"Triangle of Terror\" may be nothing more than over-the-top rhetoric. But what Bolton said about the new Brazilian President is terrifying. It puts the US on the side of racism, misogyny, homophobia, and an aspiring autocrat. https://t.co/F5amvLGDv2 \u2014 Ned Price (@nedprice) November 1, 2018\n\nBolton also used his speech to unveil new sanctions against Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nHe said the State Department added two dozen Cuban military and intelligence entities to its sanctions list on Thursday. The White House unveiled new penalties targeting Venezuela\u2019s gold industry Thursday. And Bolton suggested that sanctions against Nicaragua could be announced soon.\n\n\u201cThe troika of tyranny in this Hemisphere \u2013 Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua \u2013 has finally met its match,\u201d Bolton declared in his remarks. The \"troika\" label contained echoes of President George W. Bush\u2019s \u201caxis of evil\u201d remark, which he used to describe Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n\"I am here to deliver a clear message from the President of the United States on our policy toward these three regimes,\" Bolton said. \"The troika will crumble.\"\n\nContributing: Alan Gomez and Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nMore: Trump's threat of 'military option' wins cheers from struggling Venezuelans\n\nMore: Trump's Cuba rollback leaves U.S. out in the cold for island's future\n\nMore: Trump cracks down on U.S. business and travel to Cuba.

(Nigel French/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nIt's time to find out if Unai Emery's new-look Arsenal is the real deal.\n\nSince losing its opening two games of the season to Manchester City and then Chelsea, Arsenal has taken advantage of a relatively benign schedule to win 12 of its next 13 matches \u2014 and draw the other \u2014 in all competitions.\n\nA strong platform has been laid: The team is in fourth place in the league, is through to the quarterfinals of the English League Cup , and is virtually assured of advancing to the knockout stage of the Europa League.\n\nThere's a sense that Arsenal still has something to prove, however, ahead of the visit of unbeaten Liverpool on Saturday in the Premier League.\n\nWho is the first-choice goalkeeper: Offseason signing Bernd Leno or Petr Cech, who started the season in goal and has just returned from injury?\n\nIs the defense sturdy enough? It has kept only two clean sheets in 10 league games, and there are doubts about the flimsiness and lack of pace at center back.\n\nIs Mesut Ozil really back to his best? The languid playmaker followed up his best performance of the season \u2014 in a 3-1 win over Leicester \u2014 with a frustratingly lackluster display in the 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace on Sunday that led to him being substituted in the 68th minute. That draw at Palace ended Arsenal's 11-game winning run.\n\nAnd does Emery truly know how best to set out his strikeforce? He has switched between playing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette as the sole striker, with Aubameyang having to settle for a substitute's role or a place on the left wing.\n\nIt's no surprise there are still some teething problems in the Arsenal side. After all, Emery is attempting to stamp his own mark on the team after replacing Arsene Wenger, Arsenal's coach of nearly 22 years. That includes a stronger emphasis on playing the ball out from the back and adopting a more intense pressing game in midfield.\n\nExpectations no doubt have been exceeded in the first three months of the season, with Emery receiving a period of grace from Arsenal supporters. But Liverpool, and revitalized forward Mohamed Salah, could give Arsenal a reality check at Emirates Stadium on Saturday.\n\nSalah, who has scored in each of his last three club games, and Sadio Mane, who struck twice against Cardiff last weekend, look in the kind of form to prey on Arsenal's defensive frailties \u2014 as Liverpool has done as a team in scoring 17 goals in its last five matches against Arsenal in the Premier League.\n\nIn its last two visits to the Emirates, Liverpool has scored seven goals and the games have been end-to-end classics that always suit Juergen Klopp's side.\n\nEmery has brought a measure of control to Arsenal \u2014 Lucas Torreira, the offseason signing from Sampdoria, has brought a much-needed assuredness in midfield, for example \u2014 and got its forward line clicking. Arsenal has scored at least two goals in every league game since losing 2-0 at home to City on the opening weekend.\n\nLiverpool, though, has conceded only four goals in 10 league games, with its stingy defense proving to be as much of an asset as its prolific forward line that carried the team to the Champions League final last season.\n\nSomething has to give on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Bruce Newman/The Oxford Eagle via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOXFORD, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Mississippi won part of its appeal of NCAA sanctions against the football program, with a committee overturning the penalty restricting the school from hosting unofficial recruiting visits.\n\nThis season's bowl ban and other penalties still stand. Some of the penalties for recruiting rules violations against the program were self-imposed by the school.\n\nThe university announced Thursday the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee's decision . The appeals group said the infractions committee abused its discretion when prescribing the penalty, restricting unofficial visits. The appeals committee said the penalty was \"based in significant part on one or more irrelevant or improper factors.\"\n\nIn a letter signed by university chancellor Jeffrey Vitter and athletic director Ross Bjork, Ole Miss said that even with changes by made to the NCAA enforcement model, \"inequities will persist.\"\n\n\"All of this suggests that additional NCAA reforms are needed, and we will be a leader in that effort,\" the letter said.\n\nThe ruling closes a six-year case against Ole Miss in which the NCAA found an \"unconstrained culture of booster involvement in football recruiting,\" mostly under former coach Hugh Freeze, who was fired for inappropriate behavior not related to the NCAA investigation before the infractions committee's 2017 ruling. The NCAA hit Freeze a one-year show-cause order, effectively preventing him from getting another college coaching job.\n\nMississippi hired former assistant coach Matt Luke to replace Freeze last season. The Rebels are 5-3 this season.\n\n\"This ordeal is now over,\" the letter read. \"Our attention must now be on the present and the future of our football program, and we are calling on the Ole Miss family to help finish this season strong. With the freedom to recruit and promote all that the University of Mississippi has to offer, Coach Luke and his staff will keep building on the momentum we have in our program.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kyusung Gong) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHere are some things to watch in the Pac-12 Conference this week:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK: UCLA at Oregon. Normally, a 2-6 team against one that's 5-3 wouldn't generate too many headlines, but this one has Bruins coach Chip Kelly returning to Autzen Stadium for the first time since leaving for the NFL in 2013. Kelly has downplayed his return and says he will be all business, but there will be added excitement with the former Ducks coach back on the sideline. He led the Ducks to the BCS title game and two trips to the Rose Bowl during his four years in Eugene. Oregon will have extra motivation after being blown out on the road against Arizona last week, dropping the Ducks out of the AP Top 25.\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Stanford at Washington. The loser on Saturday could find itself in a difficult spot in the Pac-12 North race. No. 10 Washington State leads at 4-1, with the Huskies a half-game behind. The Cardinal are a game back after losing to the Cougars last week. Stanford won last year's meeting 30-22 behind Bryce Love's 166 yards rushing. Love has been hampered by injuries, so Stanford has become more of a passing team this season. The Huskies are looking to bounce back from a lackluster 12-10 loss to Cal last week, a game in which QB Jake Browning was benched. Washington coach Chris Petersen said Browning will start and the senior will be looking to bounce back.\n\nNUMBERS GAME: Oregon State's Jermar Jefferson is sixth nationally with 129.3 yards rushing per game. Utah's Zack Moss is right behind him at 120.5. ... Pac-12 teams are 17-15 at home in conference play after going 18-3 in nonconference at home. ... Washington's Ben Burr-Kirven leads the Pac-12 with 10 or more tackles in seven games this season. ... Arizona's J.J. Taylor had 212 yards against Oregon last week, joining Ka'Deem Carey and Khalil Tate as the only Wildcats to have two games with 210 or more yards rushing.\n\nUPSET WATCH: Keep an eye on Utah at Arizona State. The Utes are seven-point favorites and in control of the Pac-12 South, but Arizona State has kept all its games close in its first season under Herm Edwards. The Sun Devils also are coming off a 38-35 win at Southern Cal.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER: California LB Evan Weaver. The Bears won last week without an offensive touchdown for the first time since 1998 and Weaver was a big part of it. He returned an interception 37 yards for a touchdown and had a team-high 11 tackles.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Nittany Lions will have motivation even if they only have faint hopes of winning the division. They will provide the biggest test for Jim Harbaugh's team since its season-opening loss to Notre Dame.\n\nThere's also a key contest in Big 12 with No. 10 West Virginia visiting No. 15 Texas. The Mountaineers and Longhorns are two parts of a three-way tie for first with Oklahoma. The home team will look to rebound after last week's loss to Oklahoma State.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 WNBA players have exercised their right to terminate their collective bargaining agreement after the 2019 season, cutting the deal short by two years.\n\nThe current labor contract started on March 5, 2014, and had been scheduled to run through October 2021 or the day after the last playoff game, whichever was later. The move announced by the players' union on Thursday ends the deal on Oct. 31, 2019, or the day after the postseason finale.\n\nThe move allows the sides to negotiate a new deal that would go into effect for the 2020 season during an Olympic year.\n\n\"We look forward to our upcoming discussions and negotiating a new agreement with the league,\" the union said in a statement.\n\nThe league has seen growth in many areas since the current CBA went into effect in 2014. Television ratings this season were the league's best in four years. The WNBA started live streaming games on Twitter and partnered with one-day daily fantasy sites. Players appeared in a video game for the first time.\n\nThat hasn't translated into the league and its owners making money. According to the WNBA, it's lost a significant amount over the last 22 years, including $12 million last season.\n\n\"On average (we've lost) over $10 million every year we've operated,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver told the AP in a phone interview this week.\n\nThe top base salary for a veteran WNBA player is $115,500. A few players were able to make over $150,000 adding performance bonuses, team marketing deals and stay-at-home bonuses to their base pay.\n\nTravel woes and player fatigue came to the forefront last season when the schedule was crammed into 13 weeks because of the FIBA Women's World Cup. It was three weeks shorter than the 2017 season. The Las Vegas Aces forfeited a game against Washington when the team endured 26 hours of travel and didn't arrive in D.C. until a few hours before the scheduled tip.\n\nPlayers have discussed flying on charter planes, but the league says the cost is prohibitive.\n\nSilver said the league could be amenable to chartering at appropriate times. In 2013, the league approved New York taking a charter flight to Indiana for a game when all other flight options were exhausted. For the Aces, no charter flight was available during its travel woes, according to the team. A compromise between the current state of travel and chartering flights, such as getting TSA PreCheck, would help.\n\nWNBAPA president Nneka Ogwumike of the Los Angeles Sparks wrote a story for the Players' Tribune about why the players opted out.\n\n\"This is not just about business. This is deeply personal. This is about the kind of world we want to live in,\" Ogwumike wrote. \"I am an elite athlete. I am an MVP. I am a daughter. I am a sister. I am a No. 1 draft pick. I am a WNBA player and I am the president of the WNBPA. And I want young female athletes to dream about playing in a vibrant and thriving WNBA.\"\n\nShe added: \"And I want them to dream about the league that I know ours can become. A league that has a fair and consistent work environment. A league that treats its players as the world-class athletes they are. A league that invests in its future. A league that believes in us as much as we believe in it. And it's not just me who wants this. I'm one of 144 WNBA players.\"\n\nThe WNBA is currently without a president. Lisa Borders left to take a position at Times' Up last month. NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer Mark Tatum is overseeing the WNBA on an interim basis.\n\n\"The league and its teams are committed to an open and good-faith negotiation that is rooted in the financial realities of our business,\" he said in a statement. \"We are getting to work immediately and are confident such a process can lead to a fair deal for all involved.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa has been one of the nation's most electric quarterbacks, flinging one touchdown pass after another without a single interception.\n\nGrant Delpit and the LSU defensive backs welcome the challenge.\n\n\"I think we match up well with them,\" the Tigers safety said. \"We have the best DBs out there.\"\n\nIn a bruising SEC West rivalry known more for stout defense and running games, the most delectable matchup for Saturday night's game in Baton Rouge is Tua vs. the Tigers.\n\nTagovailoa has led the top-ranked Crimson Tide (8-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference, No. 1 CFP) on an offensive onslaught starting in January with the second half of the national championship game and only building from there. No. 4 LSU (7-1, 4-1, No. 3) has bedeviled opposing quarterbacks with a nation's best 14 interceptions and ranks fifth in pass defense efficiency.\n\n\"This is probably going to be the best front seven that we're going to face to date as well as the best secondary to date,\" Tagovailoa said.\n\nAnd LSU hasn't faced a hotter quarterback. Tagovailoa is the nation's highest rated passer while directing the top scoring offense. Most notably, facing such a thieving defense, he has thrown for 25 touchdowns without a pick.\n\nTagovailoa has passed for 2,066 yards, including a number of deep balls to Jerry Jeudy and a talented group of receivers. This might just present his first chance to play an entire game since high school in Hawaii.\n\nAlabama has built up such big leads in every game that he has only taken 57.9 percent of the Tide's snaps and has been a spectator by the fourth quarter each time.\n\nTagovailoa also hasn't faced a secondary like LSU's. Delpit leads the SEC with five interceptions and Greedy Williams is one of the league's top cornerbacks. Both are among the 14 semifinalist for the Jim Thorpe Award given to the nation's top defensive back.\n\nThe Tide passing game typically hasn't been LSU's biggest concern .\n\nAn Alabama quarterback has only topped 200 passing yards against LSU once in the last eight meetings, and Blake Sims needed overtime to get to 209 yards in 2014.\n\nThis Tide team is different. LSU coach Ed Orgeron says that boils down to Tagovailoa opening up an offense that's always been loaded with tailback talent under Nick Saban.\n\n\"Now, you've got to add a great quarterback that can have any run-pass option at any time,\" Orgeron said. \"It makes it very difficult to defend.\"\n\nTagovailoa also has one of the nation's best deep threats in Jeudy, who's averaging 25.1 yards on 31 catches with 10 touchdowns.\n\nThe Tigers already have given No. 6 Georgia's Jake Fromm fits in a 36-16 upset. The normally efficient Fromm completed just 16 of 34 passes and threw two of his four interceptions in that game.\n\n\"I remember when Georgia came here they were talking about how Tiger Stadium wouldn't affect the quarterback,\" Delpit said. \"We've got the best stadium in the country, so our fans are going to affect him. It's all about affecting the quarterback.\n\n\"So, DBs, we're going to match up, so there's not going to be many open receivers. So, that's going to be definitely the biggest matchup of the game, the secondary vs. Tua. He's a great quarterback. He makes all the right decisions, but he's about to play us, so he might make a little mistake.\"\n\nTagovailoa just hasn't made many so far, and he also hasn't had to bounce back often within a game.\n\nBut an interception and sack didn't faze him in the national championship game against Georgia, when he came off the bench to lead a second-half comeback and delivered the winning touchdown pass in overtime.\n\nThis will be the closest thing to that pressurized environment that Tagovailoa has faced since then. Only now he has eight starts under his belt.\n\n\"No stage is too big for him,\" Alabama center Ross Pierschbacher said. \"For him to come in as a true freshman in the national championship game last year just kind of proved that situation. That was as hard of a thing to step into as you could probably do and for him to go out and execute like the way that he did, we have complete confidence in him.\"\n\nLSU's DBs aren't lacking confidence, either.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The number jumped off the stat sheet: 484 rushing yards.\n\nThat's what Pittsburgh (4-4, 3-1 ACC) amassed in a wild 54-45 victory against Duke a week ago, and what No. 23 Virginia (6-2, 4-1, No. 25 CFP) will be trying to prevent when the Cavaliers host the Panthers on Friday night game.\n\nThe Cavaliers allow just 113 rushing yards per game and have held their last two opponents, Duke and North Carolina, under 70 yards.\n\n\"We're just trying to keep teams under 3.5 yards per rush and I think we've been really dominant with the run game recently and we're going to keep building off of it,\" free safety Joey Blount said. \"We cannot be satisfied at this point. We need to be hungry and I think we're just trying to add onto what we have so far.\"\n\nThe Panthers have won the last three meetings in the series, but none of those games had the stakes up for grabs this time. Virginia sits atop the ACC's Coastal Division standings, but is tied with Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech (3-1) in the loss column with games to play against both still to come.\n\nPanthers coach Pat Narduzzi knows running the ball will be more challenging this week.\n\n\"They're a top 20 defense,\" he said. \"Our offense will have to be consistent with what they did last week, try to do it again, go back-to-back, back-to-back playing really good. Our defense has to make a step up, try to stop an explosive offense and a confident offense.\"\n\nThe Panthers got a huge lift against Duke from V'Lique Carter, a freshman who started the season as a defensive back and works with the wide receivers, running backs and defensive backs. In his college debut, he carried the ball seven times for 137 yards and touchdown runs of 31 and 16 yards.\n\nCarter may not play this week as Narduzzi considers redshirting him, but the Panthers may unveil another surprise.\n\n\"I guarantee you, they're going to see another guy that hasn't played this week, a little special,\" he said. \"You haven't seen his jersey out there at all. You guys got to figure out who it is, like Waldo.\"\n\nHere are some other things to watch when Pittsburgh visits Virginia:\n\nPROSPERITY\n\nVirginia has won three games in a row and is ranked for the first time since 2011, but the Cavaliers say it won't affect them.\n\n\"I think it's just reinforcement,\" linebacker Rod Snyder said of the spot in the Top 25. \"It's a byproduct of the other goals that we've set: Become bowl eligible two years in a row, beat (Virginia) Tech and play for an ACC championship. With that comes being ranked, which is pretty cool to see.\"\n\nGROUND AND POUND\n\nWho needs to throw the ball when you're running it as well as the Panthers? Pitt's 484-yard performance was its best since the program ran for a school-record 530 yards against Army in 1975 thanks in large part to future Hall of Famer and Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett.\n\nBRYCE ON THE LOOSE\n\nVirginia quarterback Bryce Perkins has run for over 100 yards three times this season and his ability to gain ground with his feet opens things up for the rest of the offense led by RB Jordan Ellis (683 yards, 7 TDs) and WR Olamide Zaccheaus (56 catches, 690 yards, 6 TDs).\n\nRESILIENT KESSMAN\n\nPitt kicker Alex Kessman already has three field goals of 50-plus yards this season, and bounced back from a shaky performance in a loss against Notre Dame to make all three field goals \u2014 including a 54-yarder \u2014 against Duke. The Panthers \u2014 who have little margin for error \u2014 can't afford to leave points on the field.\n\n\"I think he will continue to get stronger,\" Narduzzi said. \"He's got to go prove he can do it on the road. That's the challenge this week.\"\n\nFANS IN THE STANDS\n\nVirginia's crowds have topped 40,000 for two games in a row, and they drew a season-high 43,128 for a 12:20 p.m. start against North Carolina. That still leaves almost 20,000 empty seats, but those that come have been very engaged, and they rushed the field after Virginia beat a ranked Miami team three games ago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Not until this year did the senior firmly establish himself in the job.\n\nUnder new coach Scott Frost, Ozigbo has become the team's most-improved player. After leading the woeful Cornhuskers in rushing last year with 493 yards and three touchdowns, he's already piled up 710 rushing yards and eight touchdowns through eight games this season. He's averaging 7.4 yards per carry and has reached the 100-yard plateau in four of the past five games.\n\nThe 6-foot, 235-pound power back from Texas hasn't had an easy time getting there. He started this season third on the depth chart.\n\nOzigbo is stronger and faster after going through a conditioning program in the offseason with new strength coach Zach Duvall, who came with Frost from Central Florida.\n\n\"He's improved steadily and consistently since we got here,\" Frost said. \"The best thing I can say about him is that he persevered through a competition with several other guys, even not being the starter to begin the season. Sometimes not giving up is the key to anybody's success, and he kept fighting and kept swinging.\"\n\nHere are other Big Ten players who should be considered for the list of most improved:\n\nDE CARTER COUGHLIN, MINNESOTA\n\nCoughlin is a junior who leads the Big Ten with nine sacks and three forced fumbles. He credits his skills work with first-year pass-rushing specialist coach Marcus West for improvements in his technique.\n\nCoughlin was already a key player last season, starting every game and leading the team with 6\u00bd sacks and 11\u00bd tackles for loss, but he has progressed to the role of game-changer for the Gophers up front.\n\nIn the Oct. 13 loss to Ohio State, he registered seven tackles, including three for loss, two sacks and forced one fumble.\n\n\"I think Carter is a great example of what we want our program to look like,\" coach P.J. Fleck said.\n\nQB DAVID BLOUGH, PURDUE\n\nThe senior has locked in as the starter for the Boilermakers after losing the job last season because of poor decisions and dislocating his ankle in November.\n\nThis year, he's already thrown for twice as many yards in one fewer game (2,350 to 1,103) more TDs (13 to 9) and fewer interceptions (8 to 5).\n\nHe threw for 378 yards and three touchdowns in Purdue's 49-20 upset of Ohio State on Oct. 20.\n\nDB/LB AMANI HOOKER, IOWA\n\nHooker was good a year ago, making 56 tackles, but he's been an indispensable member of Iowa's young and talented back seven.\n\nThe junior safety already has 39 tackles with two interceptions, and he's played linebacker at times to help a defense that has struggled with injuries.\n\n\"He wasn't highly recruited, but we just really liked him,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \"When he showed up, pretty much everything he's done has been good. He's got a great attitude.\"\n\nWR BINJIMEN VICTOR, OHIO STATE\n\nVictor, a junior, is coach Urban Meyer's pick for most improved Buckeye.\n\nHe's had to compete with a deep and experienced corps of receivers for playing time and looks from quarterback Dwayne Haskins. He'll get more now as a starter in place of Austin Mack, whose season was ended by a foot injury.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 200-pound Mack has caught 14 passes for 236 yards and three TDs through eight games.\n\n\"He didn't have a great spring, and he's playing at a pretty high level,\" Meyer said. \"He's still a little bit up-and-down, but when he goes, he's a really talented guy.\"\n\n___\n\nContributing were AP sports writers Dave Campbell in Minneapolis; Eric Olson in Lincoln, Nebraska; Michael Marot in West Lafayette, Indiana; Luke Meredith in Iowa City, Iowa; and Andrew Seligman in Chicago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence has been poised and in control, artfully becoming a pivotal cog in the second-ranked Tigers' latest championship run.\n\nLawrence, the long-haired, 6-foot-6 freshman , has lived up to the hype surrounding him since enrolling at Clemson (8-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference, CFP 2).\n\nHe's thrown for more than 300 yards in wins over then No. 16 North Carolina State (41-7 ) on Oct. 20 and at Florida State (59-10 ) last week.\n\nAnd he gracefully handled a potentially locker-room-dividing situation for the Tigers after popular starting quarterback Kelly Bryant left the program after his demotion last month.\n\nLawrence feels he's grown as Clemson's unquestioned starter since.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean that helps just knowing I'm the definite starter and knowing I can lead these guys,\" Lawrence said.\n\nLawrence has been groomed to lead whatever team he was on.\n\nCartersville High coach Joey King scrapped his guideline about eighth graders practicing with high schoolers when he saw the then 6-2 Lawrence's skill.\n\nThe result was two Georgia state championships , along with breaking the state prep records for passing yards and touchdown throws by Clemson's national championship winning quarterback Deshaun Watson.\n\nWhen he arrived at Clemson in January, four quarterbacks including Bryant and former five-star prospect Hunter Johnson chose to leave.\n\nFor Clemson coach Dabo Swinney, elevating Lawrence was a no-brainer with what he's shown at practice and on the field.\n\n\"We always say game knows game,\" Swinney said. \"I think they all quickly realized, 'Man, this guy can play.'\"\n\nLawrence's leadership skills were almost as essential after Bryant's departure in mid-September.\n\nThat same week, Lawrence took his offensive lineman out to eat, letting them know he appreciated their work and would do what he could to make their effort count.\n\n\"He didn't come in with a mantra of 'Oh, I was a great player. I'm going to run this,'\" Clemson offensive lineman Gage Cervenka said. \"He is just very humble.\"\n\nAlong with talented.\n\nLawrence has 16 touchdown passes, four from the school's freshman record set by Kyle Parker in 2010.

Lawrence left with a neck strain before halftime and did not return.\n\nHe found his footing a week later at Wake Forest, throwing for two touchdowns as the Tigers relied heavily on their run game (three rushers with 100 yards or more) in a 63-3 win.\n\nLawrence has blossomed in Clemson's biggest games with 308 yards passing against North Carolina State and 314 yards a week ago at Florida State.\n\n\"When I'm looking across the field I feel like I can make any throw or put the ball where it needs to be,\" he said.\n\nLawrence's fast rise and steady approach has amazed both teammates and his coaches.\n\n\"For a young guy, just his decision making.

Just all of it,\" Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables said. \"He knows exactly what to do.\"\n\nTigers receiver Amari Rodgers still feels the sting from two jammed fingers he got on one of Lawrence's hard-thrown passes. Another time, Rodgers turned to look for a practice pass when he conked him the facemask. \"It got on me quicker than I thought,\" Rodgers chuckled.\n\nLawrence acknowledged the bumpy trek to starter and the difficulty of seeing friends like ex-Tiger quarterbacks Bryant and Johnson leave.

(VICIS via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 VICIS, the top-rated helmet maker for pros according to an NFL survey, is bringing its youth helmet to market with investment from NFL players, including Aaron Rodgers.\n\nThe company announced Thursday that its ZERO1 YOUTH helmet is now available, capping several years of development and study in the attempt to make a safer youth helmet available for young football players.\n\n\"We looked at the scientific literature and we studied what is different about young players. Their anatomies, the sort of impacts that they impact on-field. And we've designed that helmet specifically for kids,\" VICIS CEO Dave Marver said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"The helmet, for example, is tuned to lower impact velocity. Its impact performance is extremely good in the front and side locations, which is where the scientific literature suggests they are experiencing the majority of the hits. It's lighter in weight than other helmets, which reflects that kids their necks are not as well built as adults for example. This is the first helmet of its kind on the market that is truly designed and optimized for kids, whereas the other youth helmets that are out there are the adult helmets with lightweight shells.\"\n\nVICIS has been working toward getting into the youth market since refining the design of its helmet that is used at the professional, collegiate and high school level. The ZERO1 YOUTH is hitting the market on the same day the company announced a Series B investment of $28.5 million that includes contributions from Rodgers through his company Rx3 Ventures.\n\n\"We invested in VICIS because its commitment to player safety \u2014 specifically at the youth level \u2014 is one we wanted to support,\" Rodgers said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with VICIS as they continue to develop outstanding technologies for players at all levels.\"\n\nVICIS is also attempting to regulate the cost in bringing its technology to the youth helmet. Benefiting from increased volumes, this season VICIS reduced the price of its ZERO1 helmet for pros, colleges and high schools, called varsity, to $950. NCAA and high school programs that purchased the ZERO1 in volume qualified for pricing under $800 per helmet.\n\nMarver said the youth helmet will cost between $450-495, which he says is about 20 percent higher than current youth helmets on the market.\n\nVICIS isn't alone in the youth development field. Riddell has its InSite Training Tool, which provides such specific data that it is applicable at the youth, high school, college and pro levels. Basically, it tells observers if an out of the ordinary impact happens on the field.\n\nMarver said the feedback VICIS has received from the growing number of NFL players using the helmet helped contribute to the development of the youth helmet. Among the investors or advisers for the company are Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Doug Baldwin, Jerry Rice and Roger Staubach.\n\n\"The NFL player investment has been very important to us as a company, It's been highly validating, and that elite players at the top of the game have seen the technology and chosen to invest in us,\" Marver said. \"It has also I think given the confidence to other investors to also support our efforts to develop new technology in football and other sports. And it's also led to a higher level of engagement from those NFL players than one would typically get from a garden-variety advisory relationship. These players are keenly interested in the technology, in providing feedback on helmet fit, helmet comfort, helmet performance. So we benefit a lot as a company from having those very close relationships.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The president described the people in migrant caravans as not legitimate asylum seekers. (Nov. 1) AP\n\nPresident Trump said people were taking advantage of the asylum process by making false claims of persecution in order to enter the country. (Photo: Ty Wright)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Thursday he would unveil a plan to limit claims of asylum in the United States, saying there was \"rampant abuse\" of the system.\n\nBut he offered no details on the proposal, which was part of a series of immigration announcements he has rolled out in the run-up to next Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\nTrump said people were taking advantage of the asylum process by making false claims of persecution in order to enter the country. He said many end up staying in the country and fail to show up for court proceedings to determine the validity of their asylum claims.\n\n\"My administration is finalizing a plan to end the rampant abuse of our asylum system,\" he told reporters at the White House before leaving for a rally in Missouri, where he is campaigning for Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley.\n\nTrump has sought to make immigration a central issue in the elections, where Republican control of the House and Senate are up for grabs. The issue could help stir up his core conservative supporters and motivate them to go to the polls, but it also has the potential to turn off moderate voters who are especially crucial in House races this year.\n\nWhen questioned about the military's role on the border, Trump suggested soldiers could open fire if migrants threw rocks at them.\n\n\"They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\" the president told reporters. \"I told them to consider it a rifle.\"\n\nMore: Migrant caravan: Trump suggests migrants could be shot if they throw rocks at military\n\nExisting U.S. asylum laws give people entering the country broad authority to claim the need for protection. Trump did not make clear whether he would seek changes in the law, but he did indicate he would be unveiling an executive order.\n\nThe 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the U.S. \u201cwhether or not at a designated port of arrival\u201d may apply for asylum. A 1951 United Nations treaty signed by the U.S. states that \u201crefugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry\u201d because their extreme situations sometimes \u201crequire refugees to breach immigration rules.\u201d\n\nTrump vowed to build \"tent cities\" to detain asylum seekers until their court hearings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not releasing them into our country any longer ... We\u2019re putting up massive cities of tents,\" he said. \"We're going to hold them right there.\"\n\nTrump claimed, without evidence, that only 3 percent of people seeking asylum appear for a court hearing, suggesting the rest remain in the country illegally.\n\nBut Justice Department data suggest that most migrants appear for court. In 2016, 61 percent of non-detained migrants showed up for their hearing in immigration court, according to that data. In 2012, nearly eight in 10 migrants appeared for the hearing.\n\nSome studies conducted by immigrant advocacy groups have found the court appearance rate is higher among those seeking asylum.\n\nTrump has repeatedly highlighted what he said is a threat posed by a caravan of several thousand Central Americans making its way to the U.S. border. While Trump has portrayed the members of the caravan as a group of \"tough\" young men, reporters traveling with them have instead described them as families trying to escape poverty and violence.\n\nThe Pentagon said Wednesday it would send some 7,000 active duty troops to the border, and the president has said that deployment could expand to between 10,000 and 15,000 troops.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of using fear mongering on immigration to energize his base.\n\nRep.

USA TODAY Sports' Nancy Armour explains how they got here. USA TODAY\n\nSimone Biles (gold) and Morgan Hurd (bronze) of the United States celebrate after winning medals during the women's all-around final at the FIG Artistic Gymnastics Championships at Aspire Dome on Nov. 1 in Doha, Qatar. (Photo: Francois Nel, Getty Images)\n\nDOHA, Qatar \u2014 Simone Biles is human after all.\n\nOh, she won the all-around title at the world gymnastics championships Thursday, as expected. That\u2019s four, by the way, more than any other woman ever. She also extended her winning streak, which began at the U.S. championships in 2013 and includes the Rio Olympics, where she won four gold medals, including the all-around.\n\nBut this was far from her best.\n\nBiles fell twice, on vault and balance beam, and put one foot out of bounds on her first tumbling pass on floor exercise. But her huge advantage in difficulty carried her to the title. She finished with 57.491 points, 1.693 points ahead of Japan\u2019s Mai Murakami.\n\nMorgan Hurd, who won the world title last year while Biles was taking time off, won the bronze medal.\n\nEven with the mistakes, it was Biles\u2019 largest margin of victory at the world championships. Only her victory in Rio, by 2.1 points, was bigger. When the total flashed on the screen, Biles\u2019 eyes widened and she broke into a relieved grin.\n\nBiles is so dominant, so athletically superior, the joke has been that she could fall two or three times and still win. She proved that Thursday, where she was clearly not her best. Whether it was the kidney stone that kept her in the emergency room until 1 a.m. the night before qualifying, the expectations or simply a bad day, Biles wasn\u2019t herself from the start.\n\nShe opened with the vault that is now named for her, a roundoff with a half-twist onto the vaulting table and then a front double full somersault off. It\u2019s so difficult even some of the top men don\u2019t bother trying it, and Biles\u2019 left arm appeared to slip on the table.\n\nThat kept her from getting enough height on her somersaults to pull off her landing. She landed on the very backs of her heels and fell backward onto the mat, drawing a gasp from the crowd.\n\nBecause of the vault\u2019s difficulty, however, she scored a 14.533, which left her in third place.\n\nBiles rebounded with a monster routine on uneven bars, previously her \u201cworst\u201d event. She was aggressive throughout, flitting from bar to bar like a hummingbird. She got so high on her double twisting-double somersault dismount she might have changed a light bulb or two, though she was slightly crooked on her landing.\n\nStill, her 14.725 moved her back ahead of Hurd.\n\nOn balance beam, she fell on a front aerial somersault with a half twist, her left foot landing on the edge of the beam. She tried to save it, but couldn\u2019t and had to jump off the beam. She also had a big wobble on her front piked somersault, where she had to grab the beam during the team final, and looked awfully close to the edge of the beam on her dismount.\n\nShe was clearly furious as she climbed off the podium, not reacting when coach Laurent Landi put an arm around her shoulders as encouragement.\n\nBut she carried a 0.092 lead into the final rotation, and there\u2019s no one who comes close to her acrobatics or sass on floor exercise. She got so much power on her first pass it carried her briefly out of bounds, but the rest of her routine was flawless.\n\nBy the end, Landi was clapping his hands over his head. Biles was smiling as she climbed off the podium, champion once more.", "These are the 5 best Amazon deals right now\n\nNovember 1 brings with is some great Amazon deals.

All odds courtesy USA TODAY Sports.\n\nWeek 8 recap\n\nCharles: 6-8-0 (Season: 55-60-4) Steven: 11-3-0 (Season: 67-48-4)\n\nSteven: Not 20 games over .500 on the season? Can\u2019t relate. That\u2019s two consecutive weeks with at least 10 wins. Let\u2019s avoid a letdown and make it a third.\n\nCharles: This should be a .500 day for me, but let me peel back the curtain for a sec: Before publishing last week\u2019s column, it hit me that I was betting Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t cover the biggest spread of his career against the Rams. It was too late to change it and I felt like an idiot.\n\nWhatever, that\u2019s all an excuse. I hope you\u2019re making money by following Steven and being entertained by my stupidity (although, hey I\u2019m close to .500!).\n\nRaiders at 49ers (-1)\n\nSteven: 49ers\n\nI really believe the Raiders are the better team here, but riding the home team on Thursday nights has served me well this season. Oakland did not have nearly enough time to prepare for a Kyle Shanahan offense on a short week.\n\nCharles: 49ers\n\nThe Raiders are a dumpster fire and the Niners can keep up with mediocre teams like the Cardinals (they lost by a field goal last week). Give me the home team.\n\nLions at Vikings (-4.5)\n\nSteven: Vikings\n\nIt may take a little time for the Lions offense to adjust to life without Golden Tate. And, to be quite honest, I probably would\u2019ve rolled with the Vikings even if that trade never went down. Especially at home.\n\nCharles: Vikings\n\nThe Lions have become more run-heavy offense, which plays right into the Vikings\u2019 strength on defense. That and a big Latavius Murray day seals the deal for a big Minny victory.\n\nChiefs at Browns (+5.5)\n\nSteven: Browns\n\nGoing with the home dog in this one. I know the Browns are dysfunctional but hear me out: The Chiefs don\u2019t have tape on this new Cleveland play-caller, and Gregg Williams defense could bait Patrick Mahomes into a few mistakes. The Browns do lead the league in interceptions.\n\nCharles: Chiefs\n\nYou said it, Steven: There\u2019s a little too much dysfunction to bet on Cleveland this week. Chiefs by a touchdown.\n\nSteelers at Ravens (-3)\n\nSteven: Steelers\n\nThe Steelers defense has played so much better of late. The same cannot be said about the Ravens, who have struggled against two good quarterbacks in as many weeks. Things won\u2019t get any easier with Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown coming to town.\n\nCharles: Steelers\n\nWe know games are close between these two rivals, but when you see the Ravens\u2019 vaunted defense give up 36 points to the Panthers, you know there\u2019s trouble brewing.\n\nBuccaneers at Panthers (-2.5)\n\nSteven: Panthers\n\nThe Panthers are rolling on both sides of the ball, and we don\u2019t believe in Fitzmagic around these parts. Cam Newton should have a field day against a bad Bucs D. Carolina covers easily.\n\nCharles: Panthers\n\nWhy is this spread so small!? Just because Ryan Fitzpatrick is playing? C\u2019mon. The Panthers steamrolled the Ravens and Eagles in consecutive weeks. What makes anyone think they won\u2019t do the same to a woeful Bucs defense?\n\nFalcons at Redskins (-1.5)\n\nSteven: Redskins\n\nI know I said the same thing last week, but this is where we find out if the Redskins are for real. They beat a good-but-injured Falcons team, and I\u2019m ready to peg them as the NFC East favorites. I think that happens. Atlanta can\u2019t stop the ball, and Washington has been unbeatable when it gets its running game going.\n\nCharles: Redskins\n\nI hate how much I\u2019m agreeing with Steven here, but the Skins\u2019 defense is for real. Adding Ha Ha Clinton-Dix will just help even more. If Adrian Peterson has another throwback kind of day at home, it\u2019s all over for the Dirty Birds.\n\nJets at Dolphins (-0.5)\n\nSteven: Dolphins\n\nThe Dolphins offense is completely banged up, and the Jets have looked good against non-playoff contenders. It\u2019s hard to back rookie quarterbacks on the road, but not so much when the opposing quarterback is Brock Osweiler.\n\nCharles: Jets\n\nI\u2019m throwing support behind Sam Darnold here. Yes, he struggled against the Bears and, sure, he doesn\u2019t have much run support to help. But maybe Quincy Enunwa returns to boost him and Elijah McGuire is the answer at running back.\n\nBears at Bills (+3.5)\n\nSteven: Bears\n\nIs Nathan Peterman starting? Probably? OK, that\u2019s all I need to back the Bears.\n\nCharles: Bears\n\nI get it. I really do. The Bills\u2019 defense is good enough to keep Tom Brady relatively in check. But then you realize Nathan Peterman is back under center in an offense that scored a combined 11 points in the past two contests \u2026 and that was with Derek Anderson starting. Yikes.\n\nTexans at Broncos (-1)\n\nSteven: Texans\n\nThe Texans are the hotter team and just picked up Demaryius Thomas from Denver. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an aspect of the game where the Broncos have an advantage. Frankly, this line should be about three points higher.\n\nCharles: Texans\n\nI don\u2019t get this one either. The Texans have won five straight, Deshaun Watson looks fine, they\u2019re coming off a long break off last Thursday\u2019s game and the defense will do its job against Case Keenum.\n\nChargers at Seahawks (-0.5)\n\nSteven: Chargers\n\nThe Seahawks have played good football over the last month, but they\u2019ve really stacked their wins against bad competition. The Chargers will pose a much bigger threat. Philip Rivers should have a big day and lead Los Angeles to a big road win.\n\nCharles: Seahawks\n\nRussell Wilson is back to doing Russell Wilson things, and the home crowd will be as noisy as ever. This secondary might not be the Legion of Boom, but they\u2019re the No. 4 passing defense in the NFL.\n\nRams at Saints (-0.5)\n\nSteven: Saints\n\nThis is really a coin flip game for me. These are the two best teams in the conference, and the Rams are probably the best team in all of sports. But they are going up against a hot Saints team that is even better at home.\n\nCharles: Rams\n\nIn McVay I trust. The deck is stacked against the Rams here \u2014 they\u2019re coming off a close one against Aaron Rodgers at home, the Saints just beat a rival NFC team in Minnesota by 10 \u2026 but New Orleans struggles against opposing passers. And with Sean McVay\u2019s scheme that will avoid the Saints\u2019 punishing run defense, that\u2019s trouble.\n\nPackers at Patriots (-5.5)\n\nSteven: Packers\n\nIn what\u2019s being billed as a battle of the quarterbacks, I\u2019m riding the better one: Aaron Rodgers. At least he\u2019s been better than Tom Brady this season.\n\nCharles: Packers\n\nI somehow mistakenly doubted Rodgers would cover against the Rams. I\u2019m not making that mistake again.\n\nTitans at Cowboys (-4)\n\nSteven: Titans\n\nDallas will win this game but not by enough to cover a four-point spread. First one to 20 wins.

(Photo: John Maisano for the University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of Geosciences)\n\nThe largest birds ever known to scientists preferred roaming at night and were possibly blind, according to a study from researchers at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe elephant bird was a 10-foot-tall flightless bird that went extinct 500 to 1,000 years ago. It lived on the island of Madagascar. Researchers at UT-Austin wanted to learn more about the odd creature, so they used CT-imaging data to create brain reconstructions called endocasts.\n\nTheir findings were published online Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journalProceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\nThe scientists looked specifically at two elephant bird skulls. In both of them, researchers found that the part of the brain responsible for eyesight was very small, suggesting they were nocturnal and possibly blind.\n\n\"Something that\u2019s unique to birds and mammals is the skull is wrapped tightly around the brain, which means you can take the skull and fill up the space where the brain would have gone,\" said Christopher Torres, a doctoral candidate with the University of Texas at Austin and lead author, told USA TODAY.\n\n\u25ba Sept. 21: Strange ancient animal fossil is the oldest on record, scientists say\n\n\u25ba Aug. 23: Fossil shows 'strange' turtle from 228 million years ago had no shell\n\n\u25ba July 11: Fossil of first giant dinosaur, dubbed Ingentia prima, found in Argentina\n\n\"It was so unexpected that when we first glanced at this reconstruction, we didn\u2019t initially realize that they weren\u2019t there,\" said Torres.\n\nTorres said elephant birds belong in the group Palaeognathae, generally classified as large, flightless birds.\n\nPrevious research assumed big, flightless birds like ostriches were closely related to each other, Torres said. The study showed the elephant bird had more in common with another animal in the Palaeognathae group: the kiwi, a smaller, nocturnal bird living in New Zealand.\n\n\"Within that group, it wasn\u2019t quite clear what went with what, but no one expected elephant birds and kiwis were each other\u2019s closest relatives,\" said Torres.\n\nNow knowing these birds may have been nocturnal and possibly blind, researchers have better insight into how these animals lived, Torres said. \"There was a moment where we just realized we need to rethink everything that we\u2019ve been taking for granted about how we reconstruct their biology.\"\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/01/elephant-birds-largest-flightless-nocturnal-blind/1830131002/", "Nebraska (2-6, 1-4 Big Ten) at No. 8 Ohio State (7-1, 4-1, No. 10 CFP), Noon ET (FOX)\n\nLine: Ohio State by 24.\n\nSeries record: Ohio State leads 5-1.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\nThe Buckeyes look to bounce back strong after a complete collapse at Purdue two weeks ago.

Minor party registration increased 1 percent for the year and 2.59 percent since 2016.\n\nIn the state's 50th Congressional District Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter is fighting for his political life after being indicted on charges alleging misuse of campaign funds. Democrats have lost 2.24 percent of their total from 2016, while Republicans lost 5.48 percent. In that period, people rejecting the two parties climbed almost 15 percent.\n\nOverall Republicans still have the most registered voters in Hunter's district, with 150,492 compared to 98,615 Democratic voters and 103,831 voters who are unafiliated or registered under a minor party.\n\nMidterm elections: 5 hot races that could help decide House control\n\nNevada 3rd Congressional District\n\nAs with California, the biggest gains in Nevada were among voters rejecting party labels. There was an increase of 5.47 percent in unaffiliated voters for the year and 4.66 percent since 2016. But unlike California, there has also been a surge in Republican registrations.\n\nArmed with a pricey new data-driven voter turnout initiative, Republicans have increased their rolls by 4.67 percent for the year and 2.8 percent from 2016 when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton carried the state by 2 percentage points. Democrats, on the other hand, lost 2.27 percent of their total since 2016.\n\nIn the race for the open seat in Nevada's 3rd District, Democrats have fared better this year, with an increase of 4.22 percent compared to the GOP's 5.7 percent rise. But since 2016, Democrats in the district are only up 0.77 percent compared to a rise of 4.45 percent for Republicans. Unaffiliated voters in the district climbed 8.29 percent from 2016.\n\nThose numbers aside, Cook labels the race \"lean Democrat.\"\n\nMidterms: Democrats have more final advertising dollars in six of the nine hottest Senate races\n\nIowa 3rd Congressional District\n\nAlthough the overall registration totals are down in Iowa for all parties since 2016, Democrats have seen an increase of 2.81 percent for the year while Republican registration declined 1.28 percent since Jan. 2.\n\nIn Iowa's 3rd District, where Republican incumbent Rep. David Young is facing Democratic challenger Cindy Axne , Democratic registrations are up more than 10 percent for the year and 4.53 percent since the 2016 election. Republican registrations in the district are down 2.29 percent for the year and 5.33 percent since 2016.\n\nIn total, Republicans still outnumber Democrats in the district, 179,529 to 170,272. There are another 167,583 voters in the district with no party affiliation.\n\nExclusive: Iowa TVs already tuned to 2020 as early presidential ads sweep into the state\n\nColorado 6th Congressional District\n\nAnother Western state that has seen a flood of voters abandoning the major parties, Colorado saw a rise of 8.7 percent in unaffiliated voters since the 2016 election, while Democrats declined 4.04 percent and the GOP total slipped 6.15 percent.\n\nIn Colorado's 6th district, where GOP Rep. Mike Coffman is trying to defend the seat he won in 2009 against former Army Ranger Jason Crow, Democrats have lost 3.61 percent of registered voters since 2016 while Republicans fell 7.6 percent. Unaffiliated voters jumped 9.78 percent in the district since the presidential election.\n\nFun with campaign ads: Here are our picks for midterm standouts and why we chose them\n\nKansas 3rd Congressional District\n\nThis race pits incumbent Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder against Democratic challenger Sharice Davids , an LGBTQ Native American woman. Yoder's bid for a fifth term appears to be in jeopardy, with the Cook Political Report labeling the race \"lean Democrat.\"\n\nAnd the registration data is unlikely to ease Yoder's anxiety, because the number of registered Democrats in Kansas is up 2.48 percent from 2016, compared with an increase of 1.03 percent for Republicans. The good news for Yoder: registered Republicans in his district still outnumber Democrats, 206,804 to 155,717.\n\nMore: Kansas Republican vows to send 'lesbian Indian' Democrat back 'to the reservation'\n\nKentucky 6th Congressional District\n\nRepublican registrations in Kentucky have outpaced Democrats since 2016, rising 5.35 percent in that time while Democratic voters increased a paltry 0.07 percent,\n\nIn Kentucky's 6th district, Democrat Amy McGrath is looking to unseat incumbent Rep. Andy Barr. Based on the registration data, McGrath has her work cut out for her because Republican registrations climbed 6.03 percent from 2016, outpacing Democrats in the district who increased by 1.61 percent in that time.\n\nMore: Beto O'Rourke and all the names you don't know but should ahead of the 2018 midterms\n\nFlorida 26th Congressional District\n\nDemocrats in Florida are hoping for a blue wave in November, but voter registration numbers in the Sunshine State don\u2019t lean that way. In fact, Democrats have been shrinking as a percentage of all voters in the state.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, there were 4.92 million Democrats registered in Florida, the nation\u2019s third most-populous state, accounting for 37.3 percent of the state\u2019s 13.2 million voters. This compares with 4.66 million \u2013 35.3 percent \u2013 registered Republicans.\n\nBut in 2014, before the last midterm election, Democrats made up 38.6 percent of registered voters in Florida, compared with 34.9 percent for the GOP.\n\nAnd the raw numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. Many people in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle maintain Democratic party registration \u2013 a trend that goes back to Reconstruction, when the GOP party was seen as the \"Yankee\" party. They vote for fellow conservative Democrats in local elections but support the GOP in national elections.\n\nBut in Florida's 26th Congressional District, the data is more encouraging for Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in her campaign against incumbent Rep. Carlos Curbelo: Democratic registration grew 3.41 percent since 2016 over 2.35 percent for Republicans. Voters not registering under any party banner grew 10.04 percent in that period.\n\nMore: Andrew Gillum pledges to find cooperation with Trump, GOP-controlled Legislature\n\nArizona 2nd Congressional District\n\nArizona has seen a dramatic increase in registrations, with 3.56 percent more people registered for the 2018 midterms than the 2016 presidential election. Democrats are up 5.54 percent over the 2016 election, while Republicans grew 3.93 percent.\n\n\"Interest in this year\u2019s midterm elections is extremely high and that has translated into a large increase in Arizonans registering to vote,\" Secretary of State Michele Reagan said.\n\nIn the battle for the open seat in the 2nd Congressional District (Rep. Martha McSally is running for Senate), growth has not been as pronounced, but the numbers favor the Democrats who have increased 1.96 percent since 2016, while Republican registration shrank 0.67 percent.\n\nPhoenix claims a dubious prize: The place most bombarded with political ads\n\nNew Mexico 2nd Congressional District\n\nIn New Mexico, registration rolls have decreased by 3.22 percent since 2016, with Democrats down 4.5 percent and Republicans down 5.25 percent. Unaffiliated voters jumped 13.36 percent in the same period.\n\nIn the 2nd Congressional District, where Democrat Xochitl Torres Small and Republican Yvette Herrell are fighting for an open seat, registered Republicans shrank 1.41 percent from 2016 but grew 3.66 percent in 2018.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Roger Federer's bid for a 100th career title remains on as he beat Fabio Fognini 6-4, 6-3 on Thursday to reach the Paris Masters quarterfinals.\n\nIf he wins that, against Kei Nishikori, he could face Novak Djokovic in the semifinals \u2014 but Federer is thinking more about winning the season-ending ATP Finals, which start Nov. 11.\n\n\"My objective is London. If I can do well here in Paris and beat (Djokovic), all the better,\" Federer said. \"But I'm not there yet. We'll see.\"\n\nFederer, 37 and returning to the tournament for the first time since 2015, was hardly tested as he beat Fognini for the fourth time in four matches. He was fresh after Milos Raonic pulled out injured before their second-round match on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was welcome because my body needed it,\" Federer said. \"I needed an extra day and this is what I got. It was a lot of luck.\"\n\nA double break of serve put Federer 4-1 up before Fognini broke back with a backhand winner down the line. Fognini had a chance to pressure Federer in the 10th game when the 20-time Grand Slam champion was 15-40 down on serve.\n\nBut Federer, who got through a few difficult situations last week on his way to winning the Swiss Indoors for the ninth time, saved both and then held to clinch the first set.\n\nFederer responded well in the eighth game of the second set, again saving two break points at 15-40 down on his way to leading 5-3. Fognini cracked in the next game and was broken to love, double faulting on match point.\n\nFederer was given a standing ovation after his win.\n\n\"It was wonderful to have such a welcome from the French public,\" he said. \"The atmosphere was wonderful.\"\n\nDjokovic also feels at home in Paris.\n\nHe is chasing a record-extending fifth Paris Masters title and advanced toward that when Damir Dzumhur retired trailing 6-1, 2-1.\n\nDzumhur had a lengthy massage on his lower back late in the first set. But Djokovic was in total control and did not face a break point, breaking Dzumhur's serve three times.\n\nDjokovic, who will reclaim the No. 1 ranking next week regardless of where he finishes, faces Marin Cilic in the quarterfinals.\n\n\"I'm obviously very proud of the achievement,\" said Djokovic, whose ranking slipped to No. 22 in May as he struggled to shake off a persistent elbow problem. \"Five months ago, if you told me that (I would be No. 1 now), it was highly improbable at that time considering my ranking and the way I played and felt on the court.\"\n\nAlthough Djokovic leads Cilic 15-3 overall, Cilic won two of their past three matches \u2014 including two years ago in the Paris Masters quarterfinals.\n\n\"He has a big serve and big game from back of the court. It's just a very powerful style of tennis,\" Djokovic said. \"Tough to receive his missiles. You know, first serves are really, really fast, and he uses a lot of rotation and variation with his serve.\"\n\nThe 10th-seeded Nishikori did not face break points in beating the seventh-seeded Anderson \u2014 the Wimbledon runner-up to Djokovic \u2014 6-4, 6-4.\n\nEarlier, fifth-seeded Cilic beat ninth-seeded Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 (5), 6-4, needing six set points to win the first set.\n\nCilic trailed 5-4 during the tiebreaker but won both points on Dimitrov's serve before serving out the first set.\n\nFourth-seeded Alexander Zverev saved all four break points he faced in beating Diego Schwartzman 6-4, 6-2.\n\nZverev next faces unseeded Karen Khachanov.\n\nKhachanov beat John Isner 6-4, 6-7 (9), 7-6 (8) in a match in which the eighth-seeded Isner had 19 aces but missed two match points.\n\nDefending champion Jack Sock did not face a break point and needed less than one hour to beat lucky loser Malek Jaziri 6-0, 6-4.\n\nSock next faces No. 6 Dominic Thiem, who used 14 aces as he rallied to beat No. 11 Borna Coric 6-7 (3), 6-2, 7-5.\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Courtesy of White Coat Waste Project)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Department of Veterans Affairs is pushing forward with invasive and ultimately fatal experiments on dogs as part of the VA's medical research program, according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe controversial procedures previously sparked outrage and opposition from some veterans\u2019 advocates and prompted strict restrictions from Congress. The VA says the studies could produce discoveries that may help veterans suffering from spinal cord or breathing problems.\n\nIn Milwaukee, the experiments call for researchers to remove sections of dogs\u2019 brains to test neurons that control breathing before the animals are killed by lethal injection, research records show.\n\nIn Cleveland, tests involve using electrodes on dogs\u2019 spinal cords to measure cough reflexes before and after severing the cords.\n\nIn Richmond, Virginia, experiments include implanting pacemakers in dogs, then inducing abnormal heart rhythms and running the animals on treadmills to test cardiac function before euthanizing them by injection or draining their blood.\n\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour said former secretary David Shulkin approved the continuation of the experiments on March 28, the same day he was fired by President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Shulkin told USA TODAY on Monday that he \u201cwasn\u2019t asked, nor did I request a review for an approval,\u201d of the ongoing dog experiments. He said he delegated that responsibility to the agency\u2019s research specialists.\n\nWhether he \u2013 or his successor \u2013 signed off on them is important because a law Trump signed on March 23 requires that dog experiments be \u201cdirectly approved\u201d by the VA secretary to receive agency funding. It doesn\u2019t specify written permission. Cashour said Shulkin gave the go-ahead orally in an early-afternoon meeting March 28 with five other top VA executives.\n\nRevelations that the tests are set to continue under new VA Secretary Robert Wilkie are sure to trigger a fresh round of debate. The records reviewed by USA TODAY show there are nine active experiments at four VA facilities, and more are likely in the future.\n\nCLOSE An investigation uncovering surgery failures and deaths in VA experiments on dogs has led to more scrutiny from the agency's chiefs and Congress, but that's not stopping tests involving pain for dogs. USA TODAY\n\nMore: VA tightens oversight after outrage over conducting experiments on dogs, then killing them\n\nVA: \u2018Ethically sound\u2019\n\nVA officials contend the research could lead to discoveries that may help veterans with heart conditions or breathing problems, which can accompany paralysis. Cashour said researchers use dogs \u201conly when no other species would provide meaningful results and the work is ethically sound.\u201d The VA says more than 99 percent of agency studies involve rats or mice.\n\nWhen asked to cite the most recent breakthroughs credited to the VA dog research, Cashour pointed to the invention of an implantable cardiac pacemaker and procedures that led to the first successful liver transplant. Those experiments date to the 1960s, according to the VA\u2019s website.\n\nLawmakers who have been pushing to end invasive dog experiments at the VA say they are disappointed the agency\u2019s new leadership is moving forward with the testing.\n\n\u201cWhy there\u2019s this commitment to it, I don\u2019t know because it doesn\u2019t yield any results,\u201d said Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., lead co-sponsor of a bill with Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., that would stop the experiments. \u201cIt\u2019s not economically sound, they could be looking at new technologies, and morally people just don\u2019t support testing on puppies.\u201d\n\nAlthough they were glad Trump signed the legislation in March requiring the VA secretary's approval to fund the experiments, Titus, Brat and Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., said they will continue pushing to stop them altogether.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t executed what we wanted as intent, which was to bring this to an end in its entirety,\u201d said Mast, a veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan and is now a member of the House VA Committee.\n\nBotched surgeries\n\nThe issue started gaining traction with lawmakers in spring 2017, when an advocacy group, White Coat Waste Project, released documents showing VA researchers in Richmond had botched surgeries on dogs.\n\nWhite Coat Waste Project, a group opposed to taxpayer funding of VA medical experiments on dogs, says this photo was taken by a whistleblower disturbed by the treatment of dogs subject to medical experiments at the VA Medical Center in Richmond, Va. (Photo: Courtesy of White Coat Waste Project)\n\nWithin months, the House unanimously passed legislation to defund the experiments, but the measure stalled in the Senate after VA officials launched a public campaign to stop it.\n\nThat campaign included getting support from veterans\u2019 groups, such as The American Legion and Paralyzed Veterans of America. It also included an op-ed by Shulkin, the now-former VA secretary, published in USA TODAY outlining the need for the canine testing.\n\nBefore he was fired, Shulkin said his views on the subject had changed, and he put a moratorium on new experiments beginning without his permission. In March, he ordered that all ongoing studies be reviewed by VA research executives.\n\nCashour, the VA spokesman, said that review concluded dogs are \u201cthe only viable models\" for nine experiments.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers obtained by USA TODAY, the VA said they include the tests on spinal cords in Cleveland, brains in Milwaukee, the five heart experiments in Richmond and another cardiac study in St. Louis.\n\nDozens of dogs that were sprung from a bankrupt testing lab. (Photo: Molly Wald, Best Friends Animal Society)\n\nFour studies were discontinued or paused after the review. Researchers determined mice could be used instead of dogs for a Los Angeles experiment on narcolepsy, and pigs could be used for a Milwaukee study on blood flow. Another brain experiment in Milwaukee was put on hold for further review, and a second Los Angeles experiment was closed out.\n\nWhen asked what the new secretary\u2019s views are on dog experiments, Cashour pointed to Shulkin\u2019s op-ed from last summer and said the VA\u2019s position is unchanged under Wilkie.\n\nStill, the VA recently commissioned a $1.3 million study overseen by the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the need for dogs as research subjects.\n\n\u201cThis is important to ensure that the debate surrounding this issue is grounded in careful analysis that takes into account the full context of the issue,\u201d Cashour said.\n\nCall to suspend experiments\n\nWhite Coat Waste Project, the group that started the campaign to end the experiments, says they should be suspended until the study is completed.\n\n\u201cI think it calls into question the integrity of the VA\u2019s intentions if it is going to continue funding and conducting dog experiments that it has just paid an organization over a million dollars to scrutinize,\u201d said Justin Goodman, the vice president of advocacy and public policy for the organization.\n\nSome veterans\u2019 groups that supported the experiments last year did not return messages seeking confirmation of their continued support, including The American Legion and Vietnam Veterans of America.\n\nPaul Rieckhoff, CEO and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said his group still backs the experiments as long as they are done the right way.\n\n\"We\u2019re not advocating all dog research per se, but when done ethically, it can lead to medical breakthroughs,\" he said.\n\nBut Paralyzed Veterans of America, which initially expressed support for continuing dog testing, told USA TODAY its position has since evolved.\n\n\u201cWe no longer oppose efforts to end VA fatal medical research on dogs,\u201d spokeswoman Liz Deakin said.\n\nThe group\u2019s former executive director, a Marine veteran who was paralyzed in a vehicle accident as he prepared to deploy to Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, also has rescinded his support.\n\nSherman Gillums Jr., who is now chief strategy officer at American Veterans, said after reviewing the science and speaking to experts at the VA and elsewhere, he concluded the dog experiments haven\u2019t translated to human medical advances for decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to look at better ways and spend money smarter than we\u2019ve done it in the past \u2013 especially if it\u2019s going to involve causing pain to the same animals that most veterans need as service dogs,\u201d he told USA TODAY. \u201cTo imagine them in cages being tested on with no real outcome that gives anybody hope, it just seems cruel.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/01/veterans-affairs-fatal-dog-research-paralysis/1826889002/", "Rather than standing pat and sitting on their hands after a remarkable 8-0 start, Les Snead and the Los Angeles Rams stayed aggressive at the trade deadline \u2013 just as they have for the past two years. Seeing a hole at outside linebacker, they went out and acquired Dante Fowler Jr. in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nIt cost the Rams two draft picks for a player under contract until the end of the season, but the former No. 3 overall pick has a world of potential. He\u2019ll step in as a starting outside linebacker opposite Samson Ebukam, even if not this week against the Saints, fortifying the Rams\u2019 pass rush with yet another first-round pick.\n\nFowler called the trade to Los Angeles \u201ca blessing\u201d and he can\u2019t wait to get started in L.A., joining players that he looked up to in his younger college years \u2013 players like Aaron Donald, Ndamukong Suh and Michael Brockers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at AD when he was at Pitt and Brockers when he was at LSU dominating and stuff like that. And, of course, Suh when he was at Nebraska,\u201d Fowler said, via the team\u2019s official site. \u201cSo these guys that I looked up to, I already know their style of game and the way that they play. I\u2019m just ready to come in and show these guys that they can trust me and they know that I\u2019m going to be able to come in here and I\u2019m going to work and they can depend on me.\u201d\n\nFowler struggled in seven games for the Jaguars this season. He had just two sacks and one quarterback hit, almost exclusively playing third down as a pass rusher and nothing else. It\u2019s unclear what the Rams\u2019 plan for Fowler is in his early stages with the team, but there\u2019s no doubt about what he wants to be.\n\nHe\u2019s out to show that he can be more than just a situational pass rusher. Fowler wants to play first and second down, stop the run and be more than a guy who\u2019s asked to sack the quarterback.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel like I still have a lot to prove. Playing with a big chip on my shoulder, the edge,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI want to show guys that I\u2019m not just an elite pass rusher, that I\u2019m a full-time player \u2013 first-down, second-down, can play the run, very smart. And you know I can help my defense achieve their goals and help this team achieve where they want to go.\u201d\n\nOne thing working in Fowler\u2019s favor with the Rams is the talent surrounding him. He \u201cdefinitely\u201d expects to see more one-on-one opportunities outside, which will give him more chances to rack up the sacks. He called Donald \u201cthe best D-tackle in the league\u201d and Suh \u201cdominant,\u201d so he\u2019s looking forward to lining up next to them.\n\nOh, and getting on the field more, which he believes will help him get back to his eight-sack 2017 season.\n\n\u201cJust being out there a little bit more often. Just whenever my name is called, going out there and making plays,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time for me to execute and I have an opportunity to get a sack or anything like that, I execute it and I get him down.\u201d\n\nThere will be plenty of eyeballs on No. 56 Sunday, especially with the Rams facing the 6-1 Saints, who are hot on their tail.", "Louisville (2-6, 0-5 ACC) at No. 2 Clemson (8-0, 5-0, No. 2 CFP), noon EDT (ABC)\n\nLine: Clemson by 37.\n\nSeries record: Clemson leads 4-0.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\nEvery game now for Clemson is clear step toward securing a College Football Playoff berth.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump disparaged Canadians as a bunch of trade cheaters and mercilessly mocked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \u201cvery dishonest and weak\u201d when the two countries were in the throes of difficult trade negotiations.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s views \u2013 and his tone \u2013 seemed to change the minute the two sides struck a new deal.\n\nThe U.S. has \u201ca great relationship with Canada \u2013 I think now it'll be better than ever,\u201d Trump boasted last month at a Rose Garden ceremony celebrating the new trade pact. Trudeau, he said, is \u201ca good person who is doing a good job.\u201d\n\nSo the latest U.S.-Canadian rift is officially over and all is now forgiven, eh?\n\n\u201cOh, no, no, no, no,\u201d said writer Stephen Marche of Toronto. \u201cVery much no.\u201d\n\nFor many Canadians, it\u2019s definitely not over. And it won\u2019t be for a long time, if ever.\n\nCanadians see Trump\u2019s attitude toward them as demeaning and his behavior as bully-ish, prompting calls to boycott American products and leaving a trail of resentment stretching from Sherbrooke to Saskatoon and points beyond.\n\n\u201cHe insulted the entire country,\u201d said Martha Hall Findlay of Calgary, referring to the U.S.\u2019s decision in June to slap hefty tariffs on aluminum and steel imported from Canada, Mexico and the European Union.\n\nCanadians regarded the tariffs as a personal affront by a country they\u2019d long considered the closest of friends. But what incensed them even more was the Trump administration\u2019s rationale that the duties were necessary because aluminum and steel imports posed a threat to U.S. national security.\n\n\u201cReally? Canada as a threat to national security?\u201d said Findlay, president and chief executive officer of the Canada West Foundation, a public policy think tank. \u201cExtraordinary. And indeed insulting.\u201d\n\nCanadians are baffled by the current political climate in the U.S., where trash-talking your friends and bending the truth are now routine in the era of \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like watching your dad drink himself to death,\u201d Marche said. \u201cYou want to get away from it. But can you?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s really not even a question of resentment or hard feelings, said Marche, a novelist and essayist who often writes for American publications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a question of like what do we do about the fact America is losing its mind and how are we going to react to that insanity?\u201d he said.\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada are touting a new trade agreement they're calling USMCA that would benefit workers across North America. USA TODAY\n\nTrump is far from the first U.S. president to spar with Canadians and their leader.\n\nAn angry Lyndon Johnson reportedly grabbed Prime Minister Lester Pearson by the lapels and accused him of urinating \u201con my rug\u201d when Pearson questioned U.S. involvement in Vietnam. (Johnson chose a more colorful synonym for tinkling.) Richard Nixon once branded Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau\u2019s father, as a \u201cpompous egghead\u201d and called him a vulgar name. \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse things by better people,\u201d Trudeau shot back.\n\n\u201cThere have been many times in the past where leaders haven\u2019t gotten along, but I think this is different,\u201d said Laura Dawson, who was born and raised in Ontario and now works in Washington as director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Canada Institute.\n\nDawson said she has been fielding phone calls from relatives asking incredulously, \u201cWhat are you doing living in that place? Come home immediately. It\u2019s just getting worse.\u201d\n\nA survey taken last year showed the depths of the Canadians\u2019 disdain for Trump and how their views of the U.S. have grown worse since he took office. Just 44 percent of Canadians indicated they had a favorable view of their southern neighbor, down from 65 percent before Trump moved into the White House.\n\n\u201cIt was the lowest we had recorded in 35 years,\u201d said Keith Neuman, executive director of the Toronto-based Environics Institute for Survey Research.\n\nAsked which countries stand out as a negative force in the world, nearly six in 10 Canadians cited the United States \u2013 more than any other country, including North Korea, Iran and Saudi Arabia. One in four Canadians reported changing or reconsidering plans to travel to the U.S. because of the current political climate.\n\nThe Trudeau government has tried to downplay the notion of strained relations between the two countries, choosing instead to emphasize the neighbors\u2019 economic, historic and cultural ties and arguing that trade negotiations by their very nature produce moments of drama and difficulty.\n\n\u201cSince day one of these negotiations, we said that what we wanted was a good deal for Canada,\u201d said Adam Austen, spokesman for Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s lead negotiator in the trade talks.\n\n\u201cWe held out for that good deal, and that is what we got,\u201d Austen said.\n\nThe new United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement, announced Sept. 30, includes new rules for the movement of products between the U.S., Canada and Mexico and will replace the nearly quarter-century-old North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nNow that the negotiations are over, the governments of both countries will go back to working with each other out of necessity, and businesses on each side of the border will likely continue to view each other as attractive trading partners going forward, said Bruce Heyman, who served as U.S. ambassador to Canada under President Barack Obama.\n\nBut for other Canadians, \u201cI think there are a lot of very sore feelings that will take a lot longer than the signing of this agreement to heal,\u201d Heyman said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who are really wounded because they view the U.S. as a best friend,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the treatment that the president and (his) team had with Canada was not as you would treat a friend. They treated them as just another transactional relationship.\u201d\n\nMarche said one thing that became crystal clear during the trade discussions is that Canada must pivot away from the U.S. as much as possible and as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI do not think it will all be forgotten when Trump is out of office,\u201d Marche said. \u201cJust the knowledge that America can be so casually cruel to its longest-standing ally \u2013 and I would say a pretty decent friend \u2013 it\u2019s like, we need to get out of this. We need to get out from under these people\u2019s thumbs as much as we possibly can.\u201d\n\nMore: New trade deal with Canada, Mexico borrows heavily from pact that Trump abandoned\n\nMore: Trump says he rejected a meeting with Canada that Canada says it never requested\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/01/trade-wars-canada-not-ready-forgive-trumps-insulting/1648045002/", "Watch these Netflix shows with your kids in November\n\nNetflix releases a host of original shows in November for kids and families including, \"Angela's Christmas,\" the reboot of the '80s series with \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\" and a real '80s show, \"Sixteen Candles.\" (Photo: Netflix, Universal Pictures, Netflix)\n\nNovember belongs to Netflix originals when it comes to family viewing.\n\nThe streaming giant has created so many of its own intriguing shows, both animated and otherwise, for families to choose from this month.\n\nMany of them will get you in the holiday spirit, such as the film, \"The Christmas Chronicles,\" the animated \"Angela's Christmas\" and the romantic feature \"The Princess Switch,\" starring Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nA couple movies will have you feeling the '80s.\n\n\"Sixteen Candles\" debuts Nov. 1.\n\nThen on Nov. 16, a Netflix's reboot of the '80s series \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\" begins its first season.\n\nFor a full listing of November shows and what to watch when the kids are in bed, click here.\n\nNov. 1\n\nAngela's Christmas\n\n\"Angela's Christmas,\" premieres on Netflix on Nov. 1.

Georgia aims to go unbeaten in the division for the second year in a row and earn its ninth consecutive series win. Kentucky is off to its best start since finishing 10-1 in 1977 and will host arguably its biggest game in program history.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nGeorgia's offense vs. Kentucky's defense. The Bulldogs have the SEC's No. 2 rushing game (221.6 yards per game) and the fifth-ranked offense (457.8). They face a stingy Wildcats defense, led by OLB Josh Allen, ranked second in the SEC yardage (295.3) and first nationally in scoring (13.0 points, 12.3 in league play).

TOLGA AKMEN, AFP/Getty Images", "CLOSE At the premiere of new Amazon Prime series \"Homecoming,\" Julia Roberts discusses what made her sign on to the project, while director Sam Esmail and star Dermot Mulroney talk about the themes explored in the show. (Oct. 25) AP\n\nJulia Roberts as Heidi in \"Homecoming.\" (Photo: Jessica Brooks/Amazon)\n\nThis is not the kind of homecoming you expect.\n\nThe return at the center of Amazon's new series starring Julia Roberts (in her first TV series role) is not exactly the stuff high school dances are made of. \"Homecoming\" (streaming Friday, \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four) is about soldiers back from war, the government and corporate entities that are interested in them and, most of all, Heidi Bergman (Roberts), a well-intentioned if misguided counselor who desperately wants to help them.\n\nPromos for the series are vague and arty, all long hallways, foreboding words and terrible wigs, revealing nothing except a moody pretentiousness.\n\nThankfully, \"Homecoming,\" created by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg and directed by Sam Esmail (\"Mr. Robot\"), is far more straightforward than its trailers and often overly stylish cinematography might suggest. Based on a fictional Gimlet Media podcast, the series is an old-fashioned conspiracy thriller in which the bad guys are exactly who you'd expect and the big twists reveal nefarious deeds yet are mostly predictable. It's the rare drama where the answers to the mystery are simple yet supremely satisfying.\n\nMore: Julia Roberts finally gets Dermot Mulroney as her boyfriend in Amazon's 'Homecoming'\n\nHeidi is a counselor at the Homecoming Center, a halfway house for returning soldiers that is meant to transition them back into civilian life. It's clear from the outset that something is off, from its seemingly benevolent corporate benefactors to its odd decor to the rules veterans must follow while they live there.\n\nStephan James as Walter in \"Homecoming.\" (Photo: Jessica Brooks/Amazon)\n\nThe series unfolds in two timelines. One begins when Walter Cruz (Stephan James) arrives at the center and begins his counseling sessions with Heidi. She is trying to do what's best for him and the other vets, even as her boss Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale) anxiously pesters her with protocol and corporate double-speak. The other timeline unfolds four years later: Heidi is downtrodden and disheveled, living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and working as a waitress at a greasy-spoon diner. She's reluctant to talk about the center but is pursued by a Department of Defense compliance officer, Thomas Carrasco (Shea Whigham), who's investigating a complaint.\n\nRoberts is the perfect choice to anchor \"Homecoming.\" Her likability, and status as \"America's sweetheart,\" make the audience inherently trust Heidi. We want to believe that this sweet and beautiful (if harried) woman is in the right. She and James have electric chemistry and together create a relationship that is far more complicated than just a doctor and patient. The writers also play on our preconceived notions by casting Cannavale, who knows how to convey sleaze with ease.\n\nShea Whigham as Thomas Carrasco on \"Homecoming.\" (Photo: Hilary B Gayle/SMPSP)\n\n\"Homecoming\" succeeds where other attempts to bring podcasts to the small screen (such as Amazon's horror series \"Lore\") have failed, because it cleverly melds the visual with the sonic. The series borrows from its audio roots in the best ways, and at times it's structured like a radio drama, with a twist around every corner. The musical score is delectably old-fashioned and dramatic, full of crescendos and key changes, screechy strings and clanging piano.\n\nEsmail slickly directs all 10 episodes in a contemporary style, but because of lots of long takes and overhead or off-center shots, he often obfuscates simple scenes. Pacing is probably the series' greatest flaw: 30-minute episodes feel at once too short and too long, awkwardly ending in the middle of the action, with scenes continuing for 30 seconds or so as the credits roll. The future timeline is shot vertically, like videos we take with our smartphones.\n\nMore: Julia Roberts confronts the opioid epidemic, talks 'hideous' trend of teens vaping\n\n\"Homecoming\" can be annoying, slow or confusing at times, but its final few episodes are so gripping, well-acted and well-written that you may get swept away and forget what annoyed you in the first place. Roberts starts to show her incredible range as a performer, turning her emotions on a dime and filling up the small screen with as much magnetism as she ever did on the big one. And, thankfully, once the storyline climaxes around Episode 8, all those aggressively \"arty\" choices start to make more sense \u2013 even the vertical video.\n\nPerhaps, like the very lucky \"Homecoming,\" other TV shows can cover up minor faults with a fantastic Julia Roberts performance. If she decides to stick around, that is.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/01/homecoming-review-julia-roberts-tv-series-debut-podcast-sam-esmail/1809788002/", "Kentucky linebacker Josh Allen (41) is held by Vanderbilt offensive lineman Justin Skule (58) during the second half of an NCAA college football game in Lexington, Ky., Saturday, Oct. 20, 2018.

All odds courtesy USA TODAY Sports.\n\nWeek 8 recap\n\nCharles: 6-8-0 (Season: 55-60-4) Steven: 11-3-0 (Season: 67-48-4)\n\nSteven: Not 20 games over .500 on the season? Can\u2019t relate. That\u2019s two consecutive weeks with at least 10 wins. Let\u2019s avoid a letdown and make it a third.\n\nCharles: This should be a .500 day for me, but let me peel back the curtain for a sec: Before publishing last week\u2019s column, it hit me that I was betting Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t cover the biggest spread of his career against the Rams. It was too late to change it and I felt like an idiot.\n\nWhatever, that\u2019s all an excuse. I hope you\u2019re making money by following Steven and being entertained by my stupidity (although, hey I\u2019m close to .500!).\n\nRaiders at 49ers (-1)\n\nSteven: 49ers\n\nI really believe the Raiders are the better team here, but riding the home team on Thursday nights has served me well this season. Oakland did not have nearly enough time to prepare for a Kyle Shanahan offense on a short week.\n\nCharles: 49ers\n\nThe Raiders are a dumpster fire and the Niners can keep up with mediocre teams like the Cardinals (they lost by a field goal last week). Give me the home team.\n\nLions at Vikings (-4.5)\n\nSteven: Vikings\n\nIt may take a little time for the Lions offense to adjust to life without Golden Tate. And, to be quite honest, I probably would\u2019ve rolled with the Vikings even if that trade never went down. Especially at home.\n\nCharles: Vikings\n\nThe Lions have become more run-heavy offense, which plays right into the Vikings\u2019 strength on defense. That and a big Latavius Murray day seals the deal for a big Minny victory.\n\nChiefs at Browns (+5.5)\n\nSteven: Browns\n\nGoing with the home dog in this one. I know the Browns are dysfunctional but hear me out: The Chiefs don\u2019t have tape on this new Cleveland play-caller, and Gregg Williams defense could bait Patrick Mahomes into a few mistakes. The Browns do lead the league in interceptions.\n\nCharles: Chiefs\n\nYou said it, Steven: There\u2019s a little too much dysfunction to bet on Cleveland this week. Chiefs by a touchdown.\n\nSteelers at Ravens (-3)\n\nSteven: Steelers\n\nThe Steelers defense has played so much better of late. The same cannot be said about the Ravens, who have struggled against two good quarterbacks in as many weeks. Things won\u2019t get any easier with Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown coming to town.\n\nCharles: Steelers\n\nWe know games are close between these two rivals, but when you see the Ravens\u2019 vaunted defense give up 36 points to the Panthers, you know there\u2019s trouble brewing.\n\nBuccaneers at Panthers (-2.5)\n\nSteven: Panthers\n\nThe Panthers are rolling on both sides of the ball, and we don\u2019t believe in Fitzmagic around these parts. Cam Newton should have a field day against a bad Bucs D. Carolina covers easily.\n\nCharles: Panthers\n\nWhy is this spread so small!? Just because Ryan Fitzpatrick is playing? C\u2019mon. The Panthers steamrolled the Ravens and Eagles in consecutive weeks. What makes anyone think they won\u2019t do the same to a woeful Bucs defense?\n\nFalcons at Redskins (-1.5)\n\nSteven: Redskins\n\nI know I said the same thing last week, but this is where we find out if the Redskins are for real. They beat a good-but-injured Falcons team, and I\u2019m ready to peg them as the NFC East favorites. I think that happens. Atlanta can\u2019t stop the ball, and Washington has been unbeatable when it gets its running game going.\n\nCharles: Redskins\n\nI hate how much I\u2019m agreeing with Steven here, but the Skins\u2019 defense is for real. Adding Ha Ha Clinton-Dix will just help even more. If Adrian Peterson has another throwback kind of day at home, it\u2019s all over for the Dirty Birds.\n\nJets at Dolphins (-0.5)\n\nSteven: Dolphins\n\nThe Dolphins offense is completely banged up, and the Jets have looked good against non-playoff contenders. It\u2019s hard to back rookie quarterbacks on the road, but not so much when the opposing quarterback is Brock Osweiler.\n\nCharles: Jets\n\nI\u2019m throwing support behind Sam Darnold here. Yes, he struggled against the Bears and, sure, he doesn\u2019t have much run support to help. But maybe Quincy Enunwa returns to boost him and Elijah McGuire is the answer at running back.\n\nBears at Bills (+3.5)\n\nSteven: Bears\n\nIs Nathan Peterman starting? Probably? OK, that\u2019s all I need to back the Bears.\n\nCharles: Bears\n\nI get it. I really do. The Bills\u2019 defense is good enough to keep Tom Brady relatively in check. But then you realize Nathan Peterman is back under center in an offense that scored a combined 11 points in the past two contests \u2026 and that was with Derek Anderson starting. Yikes.\n\nTexans at Broncos (-1)\n\nSteven: Texans\n\nThe Texans are the hotter team and just picked up Demaryius Thomas from Denver. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an aspect of the game where the Broncos have an advantage. Frankly, this line should be about three points higher.\n\nCharles: Texans\n\nI don\u2019t get this one either. The Texans have won five straight, Deshaun Watson looks fine, they\u2019re coming off a long break off last Thursday\u2019s game and the defense will do its job against Case Keenum.\n\nChargers at Seahawks (-0.5)\n\nSteven: Chargers\n\nThe Seahawks have played good football over the last month, but they\u2019ve really stacked their wins against bad competition. The Chargers will pose a much bigger threat. Philip Rivers should have a big day and lead Los Angeles to a big road win.\n\nCharles: Seahawks\n\nRussell Wilson is back to doing Russell Wilson things, and the home crowd will be as noisy as ever. This secondary might not be the Legion of Boom, but they\u2019re the No. 4 passing defense in the NFL.\n\nRams at Saints (-0.5)\n\nSteven: Saints\n\nThis is really a coin flip game for me. These are the two best teams in the conference, and the Rams are probably the best team in all of sports. But they are going up against a hot Saints team that is even better at home.\n\nCharles: Rams\n\nIn McVay I trust. The deck is stacked against the Rams here \u2014 they\u2019re coming off a close one against Aaron Rodgers at home, the Saints just beat a rival NFC team in Minnesota by 10 \u2026 but New Orleans struggles against opposing passers. And with Sean McVay\u2019s scheme that will avoid the Saints\u2019 punishing run defense, that\u2019s trouble.\n\nPackers at Patriots (-5.5)\n\nSteven: Packers\n\nIn what\u2019s being billed as a battle of the quarterbacks, I\u2019m riding the better one: Aaron Rodgers. At least he\u2019s been better than Tom Brady this season.\n\nCharles: Packers\n\nI somehow mistakenly doubted Rodgers would cover against the Rams. I\u2019m not making that mistake again.\n\nTitans at Cowboys (-4)\n\nSteven: Titans\n\nDallas will win this game but not by enough to cover a four-point spread. First one to 20 wins. I\u2019m not even sure either team will make it to that mark.\n\nCharles: Cowboys\n\nDallas\u2019s defense is for real and I\u2019m not buying what Marcus Mariota is selling even off a bye.", "None\n\nRhode Island: Providence Biltmore Museum of the City of New York/Byron Collection, Getty Images", "UFC heavyweight Derrick Lewis became a viral star in October at UFC 229, where he knocked out Alexander Volkov in the final seconds of the fight.

It\u2019s not just the number of women running that make 2018 different \u2013 it\u2019s how they\u2019re running. After decades of being told to look, sound and act a certain way, female candidates across the USA buck the traditional concept of electability, proudly showing off their physical strength in campaign ads that feature them boxing, mountain climbing, scuba diving and more.\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s so great about these ads is they\u2019re not talking about their strength, they\u2019re just showing themselves in very strong positions and situations. So the subliminal message is, \u2018She\u2019s a badass woman!\u2019 \u201d said Patricia Russo, executive director of the Women\u2019s Campaign School, a nonpartisan, issue-neutral training ground for women interested in politics, at Yale University in Connecticut. \u201cWhat people see are candidates who are strong, confident and self-assured. Communicating that is half the battle when running for office.\u201d\n\nFor Hill, who announced her candidacy on International Women's Day, it wasn\u2019t about explicitly showing off physical strength in her bid to unseat Republican incumbent Steve Knight.\n\n\u201cWhat I knew is that if I was going to run, I was going to run as me,\u201d said Hill, who started rock climbing in 2006 and used a drone to film her ad. \u201cI think this is largely a generational thing. So many young women are running who were born after a lot of gains had been made in the workplace, so young women, we can be a little more authentic.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 election is being hailed as \u201cThe Year of the Woman, Part II,\u201d a reference to 1992, when women ran in record numbers after a Supreme Court fight that saw Justice Clarence Thomas confirmed to the court despite allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nBut 1992, which resulted in four female senators heading to D.C., has nothing on 2018. A combined 260 women are on the ballot Tuesday in U.S. House and Senate races, and 16 are up for governorships. Almost 3,800 women are running for state legislative seats.\n\nThis election cycle, they look different.\n\nIn Ohio\u2019s 14th Congressional District, in the northeast corner of the state, Democrat Betsy Rader hops on a bike in an ad and talks about when she was hit by a car as a child, which led to back problems, a spinal fusion and what insurance companies could now consider a pre-existing condition. She uses the story as a jumping-off point to promise that she\u2019ll fight for constituents\u2019 health care if she beats Republican incumbent David Joyce, who has held the seat since 2012.\n\nDemocrat Sharice Davids is a former mixed martial arts fighter running against Republican incumbent Kevin Yoder in the 3rd District in eastern Kansas. In an ad in which she discusses fighting for progress \u2013 mentioning her Native American heritage and that she was raised by a single mom \u2013 Davids pulls on boxing gloves and spars with a male opponent.\n\nNot that long ago, a woman showing any type of physical aggression during a campaign would have been unthinkable. For decades, female candidates were told to appeal to voters by being ladylike, while simultaneously proving they were \u201ctough enough\u201d for the job. It\u2019s a difficult line to straddle, said Rebecca Traister, an author who has written extensively on women and politics through a feminist lens. If the political leadership model is historically that of a white man, then people who don\u2019t fit in that box better persuade voters that they\u2019re like a white man, Traister said. Enter female candidates in pantsuits.\n\nMore: Midterm election 2018: Here are the candidates poised to make history Nov. 6\n\nAfter 2016, when a candidate many deemed unelectable ascended to the presidency against Hillary Clinton, the pantsuit queen who also tried to showcase a warm, grandmotherly side, women started ignoring politics\u2019 archaic rules.\n\n\u201cThis is emblematic of a greater lesson: Conforming to the system isn\u2019t going to save you from its punishments or its biases,\u201d Traister said. \u201cSatisfying a system that doesn\u2019t make room for you or respect you doesn\u2019t spare you from its abuses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this revelation of, \u2018Oh wait, I can conform to all these old ideas of what leadership is supposed to look like, and I can still lose to an unprepared ding-dong \u2026 so why am I trying to compete on that field? I\u2019m just going to compete the way I am,\u2019 \u201d Traister said.\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Sharice Davids talks to supporters at her campaign office Monday, Oct. 22, 2018 in Overland Park, Kansas. (Photo: Charlie Riedel, AP)\n\nAt EMILY\u2019s List, an organization that recruits and endorses Democratic women candidates who support abortion rights, President Stephanie Schriock recalled her days as a campaign manager, when she advised a male candidate to cover up his tattoos, worried that they'd turn off voters. This fall, when she saw Democratic congressional candidate MJ Hegar\u2019s ad in which she explains how she uses tattoos to cover the scars she acquired when her Air Force helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan, Schriock \u201creally felt like something had changed \u2013 and I was proud, because we\u2019ve had lots of moments like that in this cycle.\u201d\n\nHegar, who is running in northern Austin, Texas, makes no effort to hide her toughness. On her website, she wrote, \u201cWhat kind of Democrat is it going to take to win TX-31? An ass-kicking, motorcycle-riding, Texas Democrat. And that\u2019s exactly the kind I am.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Democrats eschewing political stereotypes.\n\nIn Arizona, U.S. Senate candidate Martha McSally boasts in a campaign ad about her 26 years in the Air Force and her honor in being the first female fighter pilot, and she proudly recalls when she \u201ctold Washington Republicans to grow a pair of ovaries\u201d and get the health care vote done. McSally, who represents Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, is in a tight race with Democratic nominee Krysten Sinema, who represents the state's 9th Congressional District. Trump, who endorsed her campaign, said of McSally, \u201cShe\u2019s the real deal, she\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nAds that show off subtle or overt physical strength resonate because \u201cvoters are looking for someone who\u2019s gonna fight for them,\u201d Schriock said.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Debbie Mucarsel-Powell wanted to communicate in Florida. A Democratic congressional candidate in Miami, Mucarsel-Powell has been a longtime advocate of protecting Florida\u2019s coral reef. She\u2019s been a certified scuba diver for 21 years.\n\nIn her campaign to unseat Republican incumbent Carlos Curbelo, Mucarsel-Powell filmed an ad in which she scuba dives to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and holds up signs explaining that if voters elect her, she\u2019ll protect Florida\u2019s coral reef, the third-largest barrier reef in the world.\n\nMore: Majority of USA happy that more women are running for office, Pew poll says\n\nMucarsel-Powell insisted on shooting despite a looming storm and flashes of lightning. The ad, she said, was all her idea, and she was dogged in her determination to finish it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ever gonna be afraid to show off my strength,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my personality, and I want people to know that\u2019s who I am.\u201d\n\nDuring her childhood in Ecuador \u2013 Mucarsel-Powell immigrated to the USA with her mother when she was 14 \u2013 all the little boys wanted to play sports with her, she said, because \u201cthey liked that I was tough.\u201d Why would she change that?\n\nTraister called it \u201csurprising, long-awaited and exhilarating to see women presenting themselves as nuanced, complicated, full human beings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re operating in a world where what\u2019s rapidly expanding is the model of who can lead us,\u201d Traister said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a really important process that\u2019s taken a really long time in our country.\u201d\n\nCandidates and political operatives are quick to point out the impact this trend could have beyond 2018. Schriock said we\u2019re witnessing \u201ca sea change,\u201d and more women will run in elections with the same strength and tenacity that they displayed this election cycle. Some of those future candidates aren\u2019t old enough to vote, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t paying attention.\n\nMucarsel-Powell is the mother to three children, including a 10-year-old daughter, Siena. She talks to Siena daily about different issues and what Siena sees and hears in and around the campaign and at school.\n\nHer most important message: \u201cI always tell her, you need to find your voice. Don\u2019t be afraid to speak up, and don\u2019t be afraid to be strong.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/01/midterm-elections-2018-women-show-physical-strength-campaign-ads/1835617002/", "A Mandarin duck swims in the Drunken Moon lake in the National Taiwan University in Taipei.

Then, the exotic bird flew away and no one knew where it went for almost two weeks, David Barrett, the creator and manager of Manhattan Bird Alert, told The New York Times. To photographers' delight, it was spotted back on Oct. 25.\n\nSince then, the duck has attracted a large fan base and a small band of paparazzi.\n\nThe new pond celebrity is easy to spot with a green and purple mohawk, sail-like feathers and purple chest.\n\nCiting what appears to be a band around the bird's leg, Paul Sweet, collection manager in the Department of Ornithology at the American Museum of Natural History, told Gothamist it likely escaped from a private collection or zoo. But, no local zoos have reported an escape.

(Photo: NICK OZA/USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nTAPACHULA, Mexico \u2014Thousands of migrants traveling in a caravan toward the U.S. border decided to continue on foot across the isthmus of Mexico Thursday toward Veracruz after an arrangement to travel by bus directly to Mexico City fell through, coordinators announced late Wednesday.\n\nThe coordinators blamed the Mexican federal government with blocking a plan to have buses transport migrants to the capital, forcing the caravan to take a well-traveled route through Veracruz that will expose migrants to violent attacks by criminal organizations.\n\nVeracruz is notorious for violent criminal smuggling organizations that seek to extort migrants or sell them to drug-trafficking organizations that seek to enlist or force them to work in the drug trade.\n\n\u201cToday there was the possibility to have 70 buses from various sources of support that under pressure of the Mexican government withdrew their support, leaving the exodus no choice but to continue on foot towards Veracruz, a state of high risk of violence at the hands of criminal organizations,\u201d coordinators said in a written statement.\n\nThe migrants rejected taking an alternate route toward Mexico City, through the state Oaxaca, because it would have taken them along curvy mountainous roads through small towns without infrastructure to accommodate such a large group. The caravan, which began its journey Oct. 12 in Honduras, includes many women and children.\n\nMany migrants have become sick along the journey, coordinators noted in their statement.\n\n\u201cAny aggression towards the exodus (of migrants) and those accompany them will be the complete responsibility of the federal government,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn Washington on Thursday, President Donald Trump said he would unveil a plan to limit claims of asylum in the United States, saying there was \u201crampant abuse\u201d of the system. But he offered no details on the proposal, which was part of a series of immigration announcements he has rolled out in the run-up to next Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nTrump said people were taking advantage of the asylum process by making false claims of persecution in order to enter the country. He said many end up staying in the country and fail to show up for court proceedings to determine the validity of their asylum claims.\n\n\u201cMy administration is finalizing a plan to end the rampant abuse of our asylum system,\u201d he told reporters at the White House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has turned the migrant caravan into a campaign issue for next Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, and has promised to stop it from entering the U.S.\n\nMembers of the binational group Pueblo Sin Fronteras has been coordinating the exodus since it broke through gates in an international bridge and entered Mexico from Guatemala nearly two weeks ago.\n\nThe majority of migrants traveling in the caravan are from Honduras, where it formed and exploded in size.\n\nHonduras has a high poverty rate and one of the highest homicide rates in the world Migrants say they are fleeing violent gangs, government corruption, extortion and a lack of jobs.\n\nMigrants with respiratory infections and other illnesses have lined up for assistance from Red Cross workers and other organizations that have been following the migrants from town to town providing medical assistance.\n\nThe migrants planned to begin walking toward Mat\u00edas Romero through the isthmus of Mexico, the narrowest part of the country, after spending a day resting in Juchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza, a small city in the southern part of Oaxaca near the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOn Wednesday, migrants could be seen lining roads and walking through the streets of the city\u2019s crowded center begging for money to buy food, drinks and other necessities.\n\nA second large exodus of Central American migrants forcibly reached Huixtla Thursday about 200 miles south of the main caravan after forcing past Mexican marines and federal police into Mexico on Sunday.\n\nThe caravan is more than 1,000 miles from the nearest point on the U.S. border, a distance that could take more than a month for the migrants to traverse.\n\nMembers of the Central American caravan line up at dawn for food in a camp on Oct. 31, 2018 in Juchitan de Zaragoza, Mexico. The group of migrants, many of them fleeing violence in their home countries, took a rest day on Wednesday and plan to resume their march towards the United States border on Thursday. As fatigue from the heat, distance and poor sanitary conditions has set in, the numbers of people participating in the march has slowly dwindled, but a significant group are still determined to get to the United Sates. It has been widely reported that the Pentagon will deploy 5,200 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to prevent members of the migrant caravan from illegally entering the country.

World Anti-Doping Agency President Craig Reedie said on Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018 his wife threatened to divorce him if he didn\u2019t resign from the organization amid the furor over the Russia investigation. Critics say because Reedie is a member of the International Olympic Committee his objectivity has been compromised. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, file) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Facing increased criticism over Russia's reinstatement, World Anti-Doping Agency president Craig Reedie responded to one of his harshest detractors by pointing out that the major American sports leagues routinely ignore international guidelines.\n\nReedie, speaking in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday at a WADA event, again defended the plan to rehabilitate Russia following a three-year ban for corrupting sporting events, including the 2014 Sochi Olympics, by covering up doping.\n\nCritics, including U.S. Anti-Doping Agency chief executive Travis Tygart, have said Reedie's objectivity has been compromised because he is also a member of the International Olympic Committee and that he should leave one of the positions.\n\n\"He should be aware that the rest of the world is asking questions about why he spends quite so much time criticizing the organization who is actually doing almost everything he wants done as opposed to looking after his own backyard,\" Reedie said.\n\n\"They have their own rules,\" Reedie added. \"They have a completely different system of agreement on how the sport is conducted. I just think I would like USADA or somebody in the United States ... to go and speak to the players' unions and suggest to them that the whole development of clean sport would set a very good example if that could be done in the United States.\"\n\nReedie said he has tried to persuade NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to get football subject to the WADA code.\n\n\"The league is actually answerable to the owners,\" Reedie said of the teams. \"There is a general belief in the United States that instead of sanctioning maybe you should try the rehabilitation you know as a principle. I don't think that's necessarily wrong. But harmonization with the rest of the world is difficult if that's your priority.\"\n\nReedie was speaking a day after an event in Washington where Olympic athletes joined the acting White House drug czar and anti-doping officials from seven other countries in calling on the WADA to reform its governance.\n\n\"They've been saying roughly this for the last two and half years,\" Reedie said. \"It's repetitive.\"\n\nReedie has another year to go in his second three-year term as WADA president. His tenure began in 2013.\n\nThe WADA presidency rotates between representatives of governments and sporting bodies. The agency gets half of its funding from governments around the world and the other half from the Olympic movement.\n\nDespite WADA investigators finding that a state-sponsored doping program was run from Moscow, the Russians haven't had to accept the full findings before being readmitted to the anti-doping agency, which allows them to test athletes again.\n\nWhen Russia was suspended, international sports federations were unable to schedule events in the country. But on Thursday, the amateur boxing association chose Russia to host the 2019 Women's World Championships \u2014 the country's first worlds event since the national anti-doping agency was reinstated in September.\n\nThe whole saga, Reedie said, has taken a toll on his home life and he added that he did not enjoy reading newspaper articles calling for his resignation.\n\n\"I don't think,\" Reedie said, \"the world gets better by me not being there.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This week: Episode 6, \u201cAren\u2019t Brochacos Just Adorable?.\u201d\n\nFondest memory: Angelina begging for a jacket\n\nIf you\u2019d forgotten how amazing last week\u2019s Tribal Council was, the \u201cpreviously on\u201d segment thankfully brought it roaring back, showing the clip in which Angelina asks the just-voted-out Natalie for her jacket immediately after Jeff read the final vote.\n\n\u201cNatalie, is there any way I could have your jacket? (10 seconds pass.) Natalie? (Jeff snuffs the torch.) Natalie?\u201d\n\nIf Angelina doesn\u2019t get a Burlington Coat Factory endorsement out of this, then somebody in that marketing department needs to be fired.\n\nThe pot in the pot/kettle analogy: Lyrsa\n\nOur episode of course begins with talk about Natalie\u2019s vote out and Angelina\u2019s jacket denial. The coatless one says she voted for Lyrsa only because she wanted to butter up Natalie for a Salvation Angelina donation. Oddly, Lyrsa\u2019s talking head doesn\u2019t question the questionable statement, but takes issue with the attitude behind it. She calls Angelina petty and says the vote was \u201creally mean and says a lot about (her) character,\u201d pettily.\n\nMost likely to appear on Dancing with the Stars: Christian and John\n\nThe two, one a professional wrestler and the other a robotics scientist straight out of The Big Bang Theory, have become the greatest Odd Couple in Survivor history. This week, they discussed the power of misdirection in dancing, citing the Moonwalk and pop-and-lock.\n\nGreatest Christian moment: Fishing\n\nOur favorite Survivor decides he\u2019s going to be a provider for his tribe and go fishing in the reef. He quickly realizes that understanding the physics of spear fishing does not gain one competence in spear fishing.\n\nMost fortuitous Jack Black film: School of Rock\n\nLittle did Mike White know when he sat down to write a screenplay in the early 2000s that he\u2019d someday form a reality-show alliance with a Southern lawyer whose main reason for the partnership was so he could use a nickname inspired by that screenplay to refer to him and the writer. The \u201cRock Stars\u201d stayed strong again this week, much like Jack Black\u2019s class did after Joan Cusack found out what they were up to in the aforementioned 2003 film, School of Rock.\n\nBest performance in false nobility: Jabeni\n\nThe first part of the immunity challenge involved teams putting water into a large stone disc with a shallow well and then carrying it through obstacles to pour it into a bucket. When the bucket was filled, puzzle pieces dropped. The Jabeni tribe (which just voted out Natalie) chose to fill the disc halfway and then repeatedly spilled it en route to the bucket, as if the challenge was instead to see how wet they could get their clothes. Whereas Team Slamtown filled the bucket with their first disc (it took a lot of water), the losers barely got any on the first try, may have literally dumped a gallon of water on the second and couldn\u2019t even make it back for the third. Jeff, as he often does, treated their semi-effort as a triumph of the human spirit, failing to mention that the team gave up before completing the first half of the challenge. May we all be as strong as Jeff Probst believes the worst Survivors to be.\n\nBest vote out: Lyrsa\n\nLyrsa was a liability in challenges and didn\u2019t go a great job of aligning with her new tribe. (Not that she should have, but you at least need to make people think you are.) Sending her home was the right move. But for television viewers, it was a GREAT move. Angelina is a tremendous Survivor character \u2013 a know-it-all with no self-awareness who\u2019s getting a phenomenal villain edit. Look, I love Nacho Libre and lawyers who guarantee Sixth Amendment rights much as the next guy, but Mike White and Nick don\u2019t exactly make for Nacho Libre-like television. Neither did Lyrsa. To lose Angelina right after Natalie would have been a devastating blow to the season.\n\nBest final confessional: Lyrsa\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so much the blindside that made Lyrsa upset (which is good because it wasn\u2019t a blindside; she should have seen it coming), it was the fact that getting voted out at that specific moment means she\u2019ll have to sit next to Natalie at the reunion show.\n\nNext week: Merge! Counter-Goliath insurgencies! Angelina calling herself a \u201cstrategic mastermind\u201d with no sense of irony.", "", "CLOSE Scores of stores are waiting until Black Friday to open. However, even as that number grows, other stores are opening earlier Thanksgiving Day. USA TODAY\n\n(Photo: Reviewed.com)\n\nThough some retailers are already rolling out the deals, the best online bargains are still likely to be found on Black Friday and other big sales days \u2013 but there's a catch. Wait till then, and the tablet, laptop or TV you want most may be gone.\n\nThat's a key finding from the annual holiday forecast by Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping.\n\nIn most categories, from furniture to clothing, the best day to snag a deep discount online occurs earlier than the day those items are most likely to be out of stock.\n\nBut when it comes to computers, TVs and tablets, which are expected to have the best online deals on Black Friday, chances are highest that they'll be gone by Thanksgiving \u2013 which is the day before.\n\n\"If you have a specific model in mind, especially a popular one, purchase it by Thanksgiving to ensure it is available,'' says Nate Smith, Adobe Analytics' group manager of product marketing. \"If any model will do, you will get the best deals on Black Friday.''\n\nIn recent years, retailers have been unveiling deals of the day and other bargains throughout November and December. But Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Giving Tuesday remain among the best times for online bargain hunters to check off their holiday lists \u2013 though depending on the gift, some days are better than others.\n\nFor instance, based on prices since Oct. 1, online shoppers should be able to save up to 19 percent on toys on Cyber Monday, which takes place Nov. 26. They shouldn't have to worry about items being out of stock until Nov. 30, though that likely varies by brand.\n\nMeanwhile, shoppers can save up to 22 percent if they buy clothing online on Nov. 25. And that's also the best deal day for appliances, when shoppers can see savings of up to 18 percent, and jewelry, when prices are expected to drop up to 5 percent.\n\nBut appliances may be out of stock online that same day, and clothing inventory is expected to start selling out by Nov. 26. Jewelry should be available until Christmas Eve.\n\nAdobe's price predictions are based on an analysis of pricing trends in the last two years. And, while some merchandise may disappear online, \"a product that is out of stock may still be available in-store at similar discounts,'' Smith says.\n\nMost sales still happen in actual stores, but online spending continues to grow at a faster clip. More than $1 out of every $6 spent this holiday season will be doled out online, amounting to $124.1 billion, Adobe says. That's a 14.8 percent jump over the previous year and significantly more than the 2.7 percent spending uptick expected offline.\n\nMore Money: UPDATED - From Costco to Nordstrom: These 70-plus stores will be closed on Thanksgiving\n\nMore Money: Black Friday is coming: Here's what you should hold off on buying right now\n\nMore Money: Cyber Monday is forecast to be huge. The reason: can't shake a shopping habit\n\nAmong the largest online shopping days, the biggest revenue jump is expected to occur Cyber Monday, when spending is projected to leap 17.6 percent to $7.8 billion. Black Friday is next, with spending expected to spike 17.2 percent to $5.9 billion, while online spending on Thanksgiving is forecast to grow 16.5 percent to $3.3 billion.\n\nThat's likely because many gift buyers still expect the best bargains to be found on those days. Among shoppers, 65 percent say the best savings are offered from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, according to deal site RetailMeNot.\n\nAnd for those who are letting their fingers do the shopping on Cyber Monday, employers may not have to worry about their staffs ignoring work to make purchases. The busiest time is expected to be between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. PST, a three-hour stretch when online shoppers spend as much as they typically do during a full, average day, according to Adobe.\n\nOther industry watchers believe deal hunters may have a broader window to find the best bargains on certain items. RetailMeNot, which looked at holiday promotions last year, found that the best deals on jeans initially happened in the stretch from the weekend before Thanksgiving through the weekend after Cyber Monday, though the biggest savings were usually available from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. Deals were also strong right before and after Christmas.\n\nToy sales, meanwhile, typically vary from brand to brand, but RetailMeNot says shoppers may see across-the-board bargains in the period between the weekend before Thanksgiving through the weekend after Cyber Monday, as well as the week before Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/01/best-time-buy-online-deals-still-black-friday-cyber-monday/1819668002/", "Flickr adds unlimited storage for pros, lowers free usage\n\nFlickr users, get ready for a change \u2013 especially if you've been using it as a virtual shoebox for all of your photos and video.\n\nThe photo site, which Yahoo left dormant for years and rival SmugMug snapped up in the summer, will cut back on how many images users can upload for free, instead offering unlimited storage for $50 a year.\n\nFlickr had offered up to 1 terabyte of storage for photos in 2013, in a bid to draw new users. In talking to the existing Flickr community, SmugMug CEO Don MacAskill said that since users of SmugMug's premium service had been passionate about unlimited storage for photos, he thought that model would work well on Flickr as well.\n\n\"We hope they'll think this is awesome,\" he said.\n\nOne TB, assuming an average file size of 3 megabytes, would equal around 33,000 worth of photos.\n\nFlickr logo (Photo: Flickr)\n\nThe difference between the two services, aside from SmugMug's yearly fee that starts at $48, is that SmugMug is more about presentation, the ability for pros to sell their prints and having their images and videos backed up. And Flickr is primarily a photo community, which says it has more than 100 million users, who connect to show off work and discuss it with other photographers and photo enthusiasts.\n\nFlickr users will now have a limit of 1,000 free uploads. \"We think that gives people tons of opportunity to participate in the community,\" he says.\n\nThe changes become effective in January.\n\nFlickr had a Pro option for using the service commercial free, costing $50 yearly, with an upload cap of 1 TB. Now they'll still spend $50 but get unlimited storage.\n\nIn a blog post, MacAskill noted that offering so much free storage by the previous Yahoo administration was a mistake.\n\n\"Yahoo lost sight of what makes Flickr truly special and responded to a changing landscape in online photo sharing by giving every Flickr user a staggering terabyte of free storage. This, and numerous related changes to the Flickr product during that time, had strongly negative consequences. First, and most crucially, the free terabyte largely attracted members who were drawn by the free storage, not by engagement with other lovers of photography.\n\n\"This caused a significant tonal shift in our platform, away from the community interaction and exploration of shared interests that makes Flickr the best shared home for photographers in the world.\"\n\nAs part of the premium changes, Flickr will now offer tech support, which it didn't in the past.\n\nIn buying Flickr, MacAskill, who declines to reveal the number of subscribers to SmugMug, only to say he's been profitable for years, found that the audience on Flickr was \"staggeringly big. Bigger than I ever imagined it would be. Yes, Flickr has been in decline, but it's still a huge community.\"\n\nSince taking it over, Flickr usage is up and MacAskill is close to making good on what's been the No. 1 feature request \u2013 the ability to log in without having to use a Yahoo ID. (Since so many people have been hacked at Yahoo, the email address isn't something many feel comfortable with.)\n\nHe thinks he'll have it solved by the end of November. \"You'll be able to sign in with credentials from wherever you like,\" he says.\n\nWhat he's not doing is merging SmugMug with Flickr. He'd like both to be separate services, focused on photography, without diluting the other.\n\nAt $50 yearly for unlimited storage, MacAskill notes that he's way lower-priced than betterfunded competitors such as Dropbox, which charges $100 yearly for 1 TB of storage, or Apple and Google, which charge more than $100 yearly for 2 TB of storage.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/01/photo-site-flickr-adds-unlimited-storage-pros-lowers-free-usage/1812495002/", "FILE - In this Sunday, Oct. 21, 2018, file photo, Carolina Panthers strong safety Eric Reid, center, takes a knee during the playing of the national anthem before an NFL football game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia.

Curry was taken by the Golden State Warriors as the seventh pick in the 2009 NBA draft, after such never-to-be-household-names as Hasheem Thabeet and Jonny Flynn.\n\nMore: Meet the new Palm: Hint, this isn't your old PalmPilot\n\nMore: NEMO Equipment: Outdoor gear-maker pitches tent in innovative design\n\nMore: You built your startup.

A fine guard, but certainly nothing special, by his third year, foot and ankle issues caused Curry to miss much of the season. He verged on being a washout.\n\nBut what Curry knew in his heart is that there was something about his business \u2014 err, game \u2014 that was unique.\n\nHe could shoot a 3-pointer better than anyone.\n\nCurry was, at that time, a niche player with a niche skill. But rather than try and be like LeBron James or Kevin Durant, rather than to try and beat them at their game, Curry decided to double down on what he did best and make others try to beat him at his game.\n\nAnd so began the revolution.\n\nCurry started launching 3s from all over. Nonchalantly walking the ball up past the half-court line, he would let \u2018em rip from spots on the floor heretofore reserved for last-second desperation. The incredible thing was, he would make the shot. No one had really ever seen anything like it.\n\nCurry took his niche skill and decided to make it his signature move. Not only did he shoot the 3 from anywhere, but he did so with abandon. Twenty seconds left on the clock? A fine time for a 35-foot shot.\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30) celebrates with his daughter Riley Curry after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2017 NBA Finals at Oracle Arena. (Photo: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn the process, not only did Curry reinvent the 3, he actually reinvented basketball itself. These days, what almost every NBA teams wants is to beat the Warriors, or even BE the Warriors. Curry\u2019s way of playing is how the entire league now plays. Today, players don\u2019t want to \"Be Like Mike,\" as in Michael Jordan; they want to be like Steph.\n\nLike Steph Curry, you too have competitors. Most probably are bigger than you. They are also probably better at many things than you. They have more resources. But, to quote the great Wizard of Oz himself, \u201cyou\u2019ve got something they haven\u2019t got.\u201d\n\nWhat is that?\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nBut you do.\n\nWhat is it you do that is different and better than everyone else? What is your unique proposition? What is your 3-point shot? That is your secret sauce.\n\nThis holiday season, the ability to stand out, attract customers, get buzz and win the day is yours if you heed the lesson of the greatest 3-point shooter ever. Double-down on what it is you do best, and do it better than anyone else. Commit to it. Share your gift with the world.\n\nDo that, and a small business world championship just might be yours.\n\n\u2014\n\nSteve Strauss, @Steve Strauss on Twitter, is a lawyer specializing in small business and entrepreneurship who has been writing for USA TODAY and USATODAY.com for 20 years.

(Photo: Gensler)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that airports across the country were struggling with how to regulate ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft that were providing taxi-like pick-up and drop-off rides at terminals but, unlike taxis, were operating without permits.\n\nSome airports imposed all-out bans; others sued the ride-hailing companies, issued cease-and-desist orders, or issued tickets with large fines to app-hailed drivers venturing onto airport property.\n\nToday, most airports have deals in place with one or more ride-hailing companies. However, in the race to begin working relationships, airports across the country adopted different terms and a wide variety of signs and icons to point passengers to their app-hailed rides. That causes confusion for both travelers and drivers and adds to the curbside congestion at many airports.\n\nAirports adopted a wide variety of signs to point passengers to their app-hailed rides. (Photo: AAAE)\n\nA new airport ride-hailing icon recently adopted by Los Angeles International and, soon, by many other airports, should help solve the problem.\n\nThe term is \u201cRide App Pickup.\u201d And the icon, or pictogram, is a smartphone symbol containing a mapping pin and a car with two riders.\n\nThe new ride-hailing icon at Los Angeles International Airport. (Photo: AAAE)\n\nThe road to the ride app sign\n\nMany signs and symbols at airports are standardized and federally mandated. But like the symbol for pet-relief areas now familiar at many airports, the symbol for ride-app gathering areas is not.\n\n\u201cAfter a long trip, the last thing a traveler needs is confusion as to where they need to go to catch a ride or meet their Uber or Lyft driver,\u201d said Keith Wilschetz, Deputy Executive Director for Operations and Emergency Management at Los Angeles World Airports.\n\nTo gain some industry consensus about the airport ride-hailing locations, the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) put together a working group of more than a dozen U.S. airports and several ride-hailing service providers. LeighFisher, an airport planning consultancy, and \u201csymbol guru\u201d Mies Hora, founder and president of Ultimate Symbol, were then hired to help create a well-designed, common ride-hailing sign for airports to use.\n\n\u201cNeeds like this are arising at airports all the time, but there hasn\u2019t been a central way to develop the best symbol,\u201d said Hora. \u201cThis was done the right way: They hired me \u2013 an expert in symbols \u2013 and I was able to create both the nomenclature and the symbol sign that will now be used to create consistency for this service across the U.S. and in other countries.\u201d\n\nIf widely adopted as expected, \u201cThat standardization of terms and icons for ride app services promises to more seamlessly connect passengers and drivers at LAX and other airports across the country,\" said Jared Pierce, Director of AAAE Services.\n\nMeditating on an icon for airport yoga rooms\n\nWhen San Francisco International Airport introduced the first yoga room in an airport, it called on the team at Gensler, the architecture firm that reimagined and redesigned much of SFO and other airports, to come up with an icon to let passengers know the new space was there.\n\nThe sign for the yoga rooms at San Francisco International. (Photo: Gensler)\n\n\u201cWe started with SFO\u2019s existing symbol system and brainstormed ideas that would be simple, elegant and easily recognizable,\u201d said Tom Horton, a Gensler senior associate on the team that works with SFO. \u201cThere are lots of symbols giving you a warning or telling you things you can\u2019t do; we wanted to create a symbol that is calming and welcoming.\u201d\n\nThe pictogram SFO settled on depicts a familiar yoga pose and guides passengers to the airport\u2019s two yoga rooms. And while Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and Midway airports have so far adopted different signs and symbols to lead passengers to their yoga rooms, SFO\u2019s yoga room pictogram is likely to become the standard for this much-appreciated airport amenity.\n\nIn progress: An icon for all-gender restrooms\n\nFamily and all-gender, single-stall restrooms, with corresponding signs, are becoming standard at many airports. But the Gensler team is now developing a symbol for the all-gender, multi-stall restrooms that will become standard, by law, at SFO and other public buildings in the city and county of San Francisco.\n\nThe traditional \"men\" and \"women\" icons on restroom signs are easily recognizable. But for \"all-gender\" restrooms, which will have community sink areas and multiple stalls with floor-to-ceiling partitions, a gendered symbol won\u2019t be appropriate.\n\nGensler is developing a symbol for all-gender, multi-stall restrooms. (Photo: Gensler)\n\nGensler\u2019s icon, still in the testing phases at SFO, is \u201cstraightforward, and speaks to exactly what you\u2019ll find in the restroom \u2013 a toilet,\u201d said Gensler\u2019s Tom Horton. \u201cThe rationale was to take any type of cultural contention out of the symbol, strip it back, and make it just about the fixtures in the room.\u201d\n\nFun with signs\n\nOf course, there\u2019s are lots of other reasons \u2013 and ways \u2013 to use signs and symbols at airports. Some of those can not only provide information, they can also be fun.\n\nYume at Houston's George Bush International Airport. (Photo: OTG)\n\nIn OTG\u2019s United Terminal at Houston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, the new Yume restaurant featuring a ramen bar, sushi exhibition kitchen, Asian bakery and Asian biergarten is \"signed\" with hundreds of red lanterns and 84 waving maneki-neko \u201clucky cats.\u201d\n\n\"This cuts through the visual 'noise' at the airport and signals that something different is happening here,\u201d said Eric Brinker, OTG\u2019s Vice President of Experience.\n\nAnd at OTG\u2019s Global Bazaar areas in Newark Liberty International Airport, several food stands are equipped with signs that flip and change at 11 a.m. each morning.\n\n\u201cThe idea of having ribs or burgers at 5 a.m. is not really appealing,\u201d said Brinker, so OTG worked with architecture and design firm Rockwell Group to create spaces that house one restaurant in the morning and another later in the day.\n\n\u201cFor example, Eggy Weggy becomes Custom Burger at the switch-over,\u201d said Brinker. \u201cThe back of the house is the same but the front of the house transforms, like a Broadway set, with flipping signs that are not only efficient but very Instagram-worthy.\u201d\n\nReaders: Tell us about airport signs you love or hate, and airport signs you wish someone would invent.\n\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's \"At the Airport\" columnist.

Matt Schmitz, for Cars.com\n\nDid you know cars have at least three separate pressure ratings listed: front, rear and spare. (Photo: Cars.com)\n\nThey are where the rubber meets the road. I'm talking about ... your tires. They're the one thing \u2014 OK, the four things \u2014 standing between you and the pavement. And yet proper tire inflation is among the most misunderstood of car maintenance activities.\n\nRelated: More Videos\n\nClearly, it's important, but keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure can be confusing. Here are tips to take the pressure off:\n\nCheck your tire pressure monthly. Tires lose roughly 1 pound per square inch of pressure per month and 1 psi per 10 degrees of outside temperature.\n\nDon't rely on your car's tire pressure monitoring sensor \u2014 and certainly not the old kick-the-tires test \u2014 to tell you when it's time to add air.\n\nTo check your tire's pressure, pick up a gauge at any auto parts store. Pop the cap, press the gauge onto the valve stem and get a reading of your tire's current pressure. Then add or subtract air as necessary.\n\nKnow your specs. It's a common misconception that the correct tire pressure is listed on the sidewall of the tire; that figure is actually the maximum pressure the tire can handle and it's way higher than the pressure you should be using.\n\nNewer cars list the tire pressure on the driver-side doorframe, or you can check your owner's manual.\n\nKnow which is which. Cars have at least three separate pressure ratings listed: one for the front, one for the rear and one for the spare (if your car has one). Heed those recommendations.\n\nFollow these tips and you can rest assured that your tire-pressure game will be airtight.\n\nMembers of the editorial and news staff of the USA Today Network were not involved in the creation of this content.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/cars-dot-com/2018/11/01/tire-pressure-101/1819902002/", "Four out of five car seats are installed incorrectly\u2014 ensure your children are safe with the help of Cars.com. (Photo: Cars.com)\n\nCar seats are critical to keeping your child safe, but they can be confusing \u2014 there's a seemingly endless array of sizes and types, and your child will need a few different kinds to make it through childhood safely. It's no wonder that according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, many car seats are installed incorrectly \u2014 a terrifying prospect considering NHTSA data shows car crashes are a leading cause of death for children ages 1 to 13.\n\nRelated: Why My Toddlers' Car Seats Will Remain Rear-Facing\n\nIn fact, one NHTSA study determined that as many as four out of five car seats are installed incorrectly, be it from loose latch straps, twisted webbing or using the wrong seat based on a child's weight and height.\n\nCars.com's three certified child passenger safety technicians each spent 40 hours in the classroom learning how to correctly install a car seat. This week is Child Passenger Safety Week, so let's clear up some common car-seat misconceptions.\n\n1. Using a seat belt to install your car seat isn't as safe as using the Latch system.\n\nFalse. If done correctly, using a seat belt is just as safe. To install with a seat belt, make sure the seat belt's retractor is in the locked position, preventing the car seat from moving. Read these step-by-step instructions. When in doubt, consult your vehicle's owner's manual.\n\n2. Once it's installed, the car seat won't need to be tightened.\n\nFalse. Each time you strap your child in, give the seat a shake to make sure the straps are still tight. They will loosen over time. Check your car seat by grabbing it near the belt path and giving it a tug; if it moves more than an inch in any direction, adjust it to get a tighter fit.\n\n3. Loose straps are OK; I don't want the harness to be too tight.\n\nFalse. You should not be able to pinch any of the strap webbing. If you can, it's not tight enough. And where the straps sit matter: If your child is in a rear-facing seat, the harness shoulder straps should be at or below shoulder level; in a forward-facing seat, the straps should be at or above the shoulders, and the chest clip should be at armpit level.\n\n4. Using the top tether anchor is optional.\n\nFalse. When installing a forward-facing car seat, always connect the car seat's top tether strap to the car's anchor. This important step can reduce a child's head and neck movement in a crash by up to 8 inches. Unfortunately, many caregivers forget to attach it since the anchor is often out of sight behind the seat.\n\n5. I can turn my baby forward-facing after a year.\n\nFalse. Babies and toddlers should remain rear-facing until at least age 2, or until they outgrow the height or weight limit of their rear-facing car seat. This is the law in some states, like California and Pennsylvania.\n\nChildren are much safer riding in a rear-facing car seat than in a forward-facing one because of how the seat protects the head and neck in a crash. But what about leg injuries for taller kids whose feet are pushed into the seatback? Minor, say experts from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Leg injuries are relatively rare in rear-facing children and, more importantly, according to the doctors, leg injuries are far less serious than the head, neck and spine injuries that could occur if a child is in a forward-facing car seat.\n\n6. My older child doesn't need a booster.\n\nFalse. For older children, the risks are no less severe if they're moved out of a booster too soon. A booster protects children who are too large for a car seat but too small for a seat belt, and children should remain in one until they reach 4 feet, 9 inches tall. Boosters raise the child up so the lap belt sits snugly across a child's upper thighs and the shoulder belt sits across the child's shoulder and chest, putting the crash forces on strong parts of the body. Seat belts that incorrectly rest on the stomach or neck can cause deadly injuries in a crash.\n\nAccording to research from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, kids age 4 to 8 riding in booster seats are 45 percent less likely to be injured in a crash compared with children using just a seat belt. NHTSA recommends that kids remain in a booster until they're at least 8 years old or 4 feet, 9 inches tall, and this is the law in many states.\n\nFiguring out what car seats your family needs is not easy, and more help is available.

(Photo: Cars.com)\n\nAdmit it: You've been there. We all have. You were making great time. You were trying to beat rush hour. You wanted to wait until the next food stop or bathroom break. But you overestimated your gas mileage and cut it too close. Your fuel light came on. And now you're in the middle of nowhere, with no idea how far it is to the next gas station. What do you do?\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Safeguard Your Car Against a Cyberattack\n\n\"The first step is, repeat after me: 'Our father, who art in heaven ... ,' \" AAA Technical Services Manager Michael Calkins suggested in jest.\n\nBut once you're done praying and/or panicking, it's time to dab the sweat off your forehead, let the blood flow back into your white knuckles and make some rational decisions. We consulted automotive experts at AAA and Universal Technical Institute to compile a list of best practices while on the road when you're running on empty with no fuel pump in sight. Some of these may seem like common sense, but in an informal survey of even our automotive-savvy team members here at Cars.com, there were plenty of misconceptions.\n\nHere are six things you should do when running out of gas:\n\n1. Get Your Bearings\n\nCalkins said the first thing you should do is pull over and locate the nearest gas station using your vehicle's navigation system or your smartphone (AAA has an app for that).\n\n2. Slow Your Roll\n\nCars are the most fuel-efficient at 35 to 45 mph, Calkins said. You have to consider state traffic laws and safety if you're on a fast-moving interstate highway, but the point is: Don't speed up to try to get to the gas station faster. Slow and steady wins this race.\n\n3. 86 the A/C\n\nScott Keene, education manager at UTI in Lisle, Ill., explained that turning off the air conditioning reduces engine stress, saving precious fuel, and should be done immediately. In addition to the air-conditioning compressor that runs off a belt (in virtually all cars), air conditioning also turns on the cabin fan and a more power-hungry fan behind the car's radiator. \"As the electrical load in the car increases, you are increasing the strain on the alternator, which in turn increases the demand from the engine that results in a decrease in fuel economy,\" Keene said. This also applies to the few models that use electric-powered air-conditioning compressors, primarily gas/electric hybrids.\n\n4. Ax Accessories\n\nFor the same reason as above, turn off the stereo, especially a high-powered one, along with all other electrical devices, such as charging phones. The fuel savings may be small, but: \"It could be the difference between pushing the car two blocks and coasting up to the pump,\" Calkins said.\n\n5. Roll 'Em Up!\n\nKeep your windows rolled up to reduce wind resistance on your vehicle. We know, we know, but yes: You have to turn off the air conditioner and keep the windows rolled up. You should've thought of that before your tank got low.\n\n6. Drive Downhill\n\nOK, it's unlikely you'll have the choice, but if your navigation app finds two nearby gas stations and one is downhill, pick that one. It takes less gas to coast downhill than to climb a grade. What you shouldn't do is shift into Neutral when coasting. There was a time when this made a little bit of sense, but today's cars are designed to turn off their fuel injectors and save gas while coasting, even though the car's inertia keeps the engine turning. Putting the transmission in Neutral is actually more wasteful, because it requires gas to keep the engine running so you don't lose power steering and brakes.\n\nWith these tips and some luck, you'll be able to make it to a gas station on fumes. But if you don't, Marty Kucha, also an education manager at UTI, said to have your roadside assistance plan in place.\n\n\"Take the time to figure out if your car came with roadside assistance from the dealer, or if you belong to AAA,\" Kucha said. \"Put that information into your phone, or have it easily accessible somewhere. You're paying for it; don't be afraid to use the services \u2014 that's what they are there for. They can come out and provide you with a quick fill-up to get you to the nearest station.\"\n\nEven if you luck out, though, the stress of the situation just isn't worth it. Plus, running yourself dry isn't great for your car as the crud settled at the bottom of your tank can get sucked into the engine, and possibly cause the fuel line to freeze.\n\nAll agree that prevention is always the best way to avoid trouble. Make it a habit not to let your fuel gauge dip below a quarter-tank (a half-tank if you live in a rural area). Keep your tires inflated to the proper pressure listed in your owner's manual, and remember that when you're loaded up with passengers, luggage, golf clubs, etc., you're not going to get the same fuel economy you would get with an empty car. A big \"don't,\" is carrying an extra gallon of gasoline in your car for emergencies; it's a fire hazard, plus the gas goes bad eventually.\n\nWhile no industry standard exists as to how much gas is left in your tank when the fuel light comes on, it's generally about 40 miles' worth, Keene said. But because \"your results may vary,\" he suggested this experiment.\n\nThe next time your fuel light comes on, go immediately to a gas station and fill up.\n\nMake note of how many gallons your car took.\n\nSubtract the number of gallons from the capacity of your gas tank. So if you have a 14-gallon tank, and your car took 12 gallons, the fuel light came on at 2 gallons.\n\nMultiply that number by your car's average estimated fuel economy, and the result is about how many miles you can go once the light comes on. Two gallons times, say, 26 mpg equals 52 miles.\n\nThe bottom line to avoid paying the price is to never get to that point in the first place, no matter how you rationalize the risk.\n\n\"If your fuel is getting down to a quarter tank,\" Calkins said, \"try to shut down that inner voice and just stop.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated on May 11 to add information on coasting downhill when low on gas and the benefits of turning off the car's air conditioner.\n\nMembers of the editorial and news staff of the USA Today Network were not involved in the creation of this content.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/cars-dot-com/2018/11/01/6-things-do-when-youre-running-out-gas/1819551002/", "Seth Meyers will host a special live edition of NBC's 'Late Night with Seth Meyers' on Election Night.

We've adjusted the standings but we need to improve our play and team chemistry,\" Gattuso said. \"We need to do well to maintain this position.\"\n\nA seven-time European champion, Milan has missed the Champions League for the fifth consecutive season.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Milan's appearance among the top four coincides with rival Inter's rise to second place.\n\nAlso, Inter is back in the Champions League this season after a six-season absence from the elite competition.\n\nThe last time both Milan and Inter played in the Champions League was in 2011-12.\n\nMilan's recent turnaround was helped with some surprising decisions from Gattuso.\n\nFirst, the coach paired center forwards Gonzalo Higuain and Patrick Cutrone together to great effect, especially in the win over Sampdoria. Then Gattuso fielded a three-man defense against Genoa.\n\n\"I've got to find the best option for controlling the middle of the field, and the 3-5-2 allows us to have better numbers in the middle and more passing,\" Gattuso said.\n\nStill, Milan once again conceded \u2014 marking the first time it's failed to keep a clean sheet in its opening 10 matches since 1932-33. Going back to last season, the streak is at 16 games.\n\n\"We need to get back to giving off the feeling that we're controlling the match,\" Gattuso said.\n\nWhile Genoa striker Krzysztof Piatek was kept scoreless for the third straight match \u2014 after scoring nine goals over the opening seven \u2014 Milan struggled for long stretches and wasn't helped by Romagnoli's own-goal, which made it 1-1 early in the second half.\n\nBut Romagnoli made up for his earlier mistake when he met a punched clearance from goalkeeper Andrei Radu with a lobbed volley from beyond the area in the first minute of added time.\n\n\"I was lucky but that was what I intended to do,\" said Romagnoli, Milan's captain. \"We were criticized too much for those two defeats.

(AP Photo/Javier Gandul) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Brazilian teenager Vinicius Junior has become the immediate beneficiary of Real Madrid's coaching change.\n\nThe 18-year-old forward impressed in his first start for Madrid on Wednesday, helping set up two goals in a 4-0 win at Melilla in the debut of interim coach Santiago Solari.\n\nThe win came two days Solari was promoted from Madrid's reserve team to replace Julen Lopetegui, who was fired following a horrible run of results that ended with a 5-1 loss at Barcelona.\n\nThe schedule provided Solari, a former Madrid midfielder, with an easy first game in charge, a visit to third-division club Melilla in the round-of-32 of the Copa del Rey. It was the ideal scenario to feature Vinicius, who had spent most of his first season in Madrid playing under Solari on its \"B'' team.\n\nLopetegui had apparently considered Vinicius a raw talent that needed to be nurtured along slowly.\n\nBut at Melilla, Vinicius was Madrid's leader up front, displaying speed, nifty dribbling, and an understanding with his veteran teammates.\n\nVinicius used a skillful pass with the outside edge of his right boot for Marco Asensio to score Madrid's second goal. He also helped out on the next one with a pass off the back of this right heel. The ball was eventually scrambled in by Alvaro Odriozola.\n\nVinicius added a powerful shot that hit the crossbar, as well as an audacious \"rabona\" pass, a tricky move in which the player kicks the ball from behind his other leg.\n\n\"He played the 90 minutes. He is a great young talent, 18 years old, who has just arrived,\" Solari said of Vinicius. \"He's living in a new country, adapting to another style of soccer and to a new world at Real Madrid.\n\n\"He has a lot to learn, and yet his talent is evident, you can see it in everything he does. He will mature on his own, although he clearly needs minutes.\"\n\nVinicius joined the European champions in the offseason after they paid the considerable figure of 45 million euros ($52 million) to Brazilian club Flamengo last year.\n\nAfter Madrid agreed to sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus, many fans expected Lopetegui to play Vinicius more. Instead, he made two appearances for a total of 12 minutes under Lopetegui, despite the poor form of forwards Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale.\n\nSolari has been put in charge on a temporary basis while the club looks for a new coach. Local media, however, has not ruled out the option that the Argentine could stay on if good results keep coming.\n\nWhile Melilla, a team from a tiny Spanish enclave on the north African coast, was a pushover, Madrid faces a much tougher test when it hosts Valladolid in the Spanish league on Saturday.\n\nValladolid has only lost twice this season, is on a six-match unbeaten streak, and arrives to the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in sixth place.\n\nLopetegui left Madrid in ninth place, seven points behind leader Barcelona, and without a win in five straight games.\n\nGiven Bale's dismal game at Barcelona last weekend, Solari could again entrust Vinicius to spark his attack.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Scott Walker at the Oneida Golf & Country Club on Wednesday, October 10, 2018 in Green Bay, Wis. (Photo: Adam Wesley/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 After Josh Hawley decided to challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the 2018 midterm elections, he got plenty of campaign advice from a seasoned fellow Republican: Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe vice president talked to Hawley about messaging and pressed him on his plan for raising money to compete with McCaskill, a prolific fundraiser. It was Pence, in fact, who had helped convince Hawley to enter Missouri's Senate race, what has become one of the most closely watched contests in Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nPence\u2019s involvement in the midterm elections that will decide control of Congress has taken him to at least three dozen states over the past 10 months for rallies, fundraising events and to sell the GOP tax cuts. While predecessors such as Dick Cheney and Joe Biden also campaigned intensively during midterm elections, Pence, a former governor and six-term congressman who enjoys a good fight, has taken to the task with particular zeal, wooing donors, sending six-figure checks from his political action committee, to gubernatorial candidates, revving up the Christian conservative base and cutting commercials for Republican Senate candidates.\n\nHe\u2019s been able to do so without drawing a lot of the attention \u2013 and scrutiny \u2013 that Trump has. Instead of the large rallies that Trump feeds off of with freewheeling remarks, Pence\u2019s has smaller, more traditional political appearances where he refers to himself as \u201cMike\u201d from \u201cwhat we call the Walmart Wing of the West Wing\u201d and sticks to the script.\n\n\u201cLet's make sure that blue wave hits a red wall right here,\u201d Pence has said in various iterations in Texas, Nevada, New Mexico, Michigan, Oklahoma and elsewhere, pounding out the sentence with pauses in between the last four words.\n\nPence can come across as earnest but affable \u2013 if a little artificial \u2013 as he leans into his lectern, reassuring farmers in Iowa that Trump\u2019s trade battles will work out well for them or drawing standing ovations when taking a victory lap on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nWhile Trump revels in the \u201cdid he just say that?\u201d comments, even Pence\u2019s recent warning that the election is a \u201cchoice between jobs or mobs\u201d sounds more like a rhetorical flourish than a battle cry.\n\nIf Trump dominates the headlines, Pence has amassed a different measure of impact. He\u2019s raised more than $70 million for fellow Republicans and made more than 140 candidate rallies or fundraising events, according to his political team.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a secret weapon for so many members,\u201d said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nVice President Mike Pence appears on stage with U.S. Senate candidate Josh Hawley, who is running against Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri, at the Oasis Hotel & Convention Center during a private fundraising event in Springfield, Mo. on Monday, Oct. 8, 2018. (Photo: Nathan Papes/News-Leader)\n\n\u2018Blank slate\u2019\n\nBut groups like Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign, which have organized protesters at some of his events and say opposition to Pence\u2019s record has helped them raise money and motivate their voters, are trying to prevent him from flying completely under the radar.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just sort of a blank slate in a lot of people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Geoff Wetrosky, campaign director for the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to make sure that people understand his record. Because he is polarizing. People just don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nThe amount of Pence\u2019s political activity \u2013 and fact that his chief of staff is a political operative and Pence is the first vice president to create his own political action committee in his first term \u2013 stand out, said Joel Goldstein, a vice presidential expert at the Saint Louis University School of Law.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that Pence is spending relatively more of his time doing political things\u201d than did other recent vice presidents, Goldstein said.\n\nBut don\u2019t suggest \u2013 at least not to Pence \u2013 that he is doing it for any reason other than to help Trump.\n\nPence has gone out of his way to portray himself as loyal to the president, raising money and stumping for candidates to help Trump succeed and not to benefit his own political aspirations.\n\n\u201cWe understand these things don\u2019t hurt you,\u201d said Marty Obst, Pence\u2019s senior political adviser. \u201cBut the future is a long way away.\u201d\n\nBut if the future comes sooner than expected \u2013 such as through a report from special counsel Robert Mueller serious enough to make congressional Republicans wonder if they want to stick with Trump \u2013 the amount of time Pence has spent helping members of Congress will be remembered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to break ranks and vote articles of impeachment if you feel that the person who will become president not only reflects your values and your policy positions, but is your friend,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who worked for Vice President Al Gore. \u201cWho has friends among House members? It ain\u2019t Donald Trump. It\u2019s Mike Pence.\u201d\n\nTrump chose the then-Indiana governor and former House member as his running mate in 2016 in part for his ties to the GOP establishment and fundraising skills.\n\nBoth assets have deep roots.\n\nAs president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation in the early 1990s, Pence made influential friends throughout the country through a network of conservative think tanks. When Pence was elected to the House in 2000, he received substantial support from the campaign arm of House Republicans, which sent the House speaker and other big names to campaign for him.\n\nVice President Mike Pence visits with supporters as he stumps for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Martha McSally on Oct. 26, 2018, in Yuma, Arizona. (Photo: Rob Schumacher/The Republic)\n\nPaying his dues\n\nAfter winning his election, Pence overpaid his \u201cdues\u201d to the National Republican Congressional Committee, raising more money than he was expected to and continuing throughout his career to contribute despite not having the committee assignments that make it easy to collect dollars, according to former NRCC chair Tom Davis.\n\n\u201cMike has always been grateful for what the party did for him,\u201d said Davis, who called Pence's current level of involvement \"extraordinary.\"\n\n\u201cThis is part of his DNA,\u201d he said.\n\nLikewise, as governor, Pence was a top fundraiser among fellow governors for his GOP colleagues in the 2014 midterms.\n\nAnd when Pence joined Trump on the 2016 ticket, the Republican National Committee gave him a list of donors to work on.\n\n\u201cHe continues to be the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval to a lot of conservative donors,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe can talk about the interest groups that make up the conservative coalition in a way that very few people can do.\u201d\n\nAs planning for the midterm elections got underway, Pence plotted with McCarthy about going to California because of the number of vulnerable GOP incumbents there representing districts that Trump lost. The duo created a joint fundraising committee that collected $5 million in two days for multiple lawmakers \u2013 \u201cmore than I thought they would get,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nThe strategy was quickly expanded to other states, providing crucial fundraising help for incumbents in a year when many were getting outraised by Democratic challengers.\n\nOn the Senate side, Pence\u2019s extensive help for Hawley, the Missouri Senate candidate, included serving as the main attraction at fundraisers in July and October, touting the GOP tax cuts with Hawley by his side in St. Louis, and praising Hawley as a man of faith and of principle at a rally in Springfield.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember somebody else that has traveled as much as the vice president,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHe understands what\u2019s needed in a campaign.\u201d\n\nOne reason Pence is campaigning so hard is he knows what it\u2019s like to be in the minority.\n\n\u201cI was in Congress the last time Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the House,\u201d Pence said at recent rally for Nevada Rep. Cresent Hardy, one of dozen candidates he campaigned for over a four-day period. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want that to ever happen again.\u201d\n\nRon Klain, who worked for the last two Democratic vice presidents, said Pence\u2019s political activity does appear to be at the high end. But it also seems to be concentrated more at bridging the gap between traditional party groups and the Trump political apparatus rather than trying to reach out to swing voters, he said.\n\n\u201cClearly he is a lightning rod for some progressive groups in a way that really wasn\u2019t the case on the opposite side for either (Al) Gore or (Joe) Biden,\u201d Klain said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood noticed that right after the presidential election when the group started receiving contributions in Pence\u2019s name \u2013 about one-quarter of donations collected in the first month. Planned Parenthood still receives thousands of donations a month in \u201chonor\u201d of Pence. And in an election year in which women are driving much of the voter enthusiasm, the group has been highlighting Pence\u2019s strong anti-abortion record and efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"While he may not get as much attention as Trump,\" said Erica Sackin, Planned Parenthood\u2019s director of political communications, \"he really embodies the same kind of anti-woman policy and sentiment that we're seeing being pushed by the leadership of the Republican Party and that people are rebelling against.\"\n\nDemocratic candidates have also tried to use Pence to their advantage. During a candidate debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts attempted to tie Republican challenger Geoff Diehl to Pence\u2019s record on gay rights, including his backing as governor a \u201creligious freedom\u201d law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians.\n\nApplying political jujitsu, Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, uses Pence\u2019s expansion of Medicaid in Indiana to argue that Georgia should do the same.\n\nBut Pence, who has already made several trips to Georgia, squeezed in another trip Thursday to help turn out the vote for Abrams\u2019 opponent, Brian Kemp.\n\nNoting that Abrams was getting help from Oprah Winfrey and Will Ferrell, Pence channeled Ferrell's \"Anchorman\" character Ron Burgundy when he joked: \"I\u2019m kind of a big deal too.\"\n\nPence was also planning to go to Indiana, Tennessee, Florida, North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana, staying on the road \"almost continuously\" and making multiple stops a day in the run-up to the election.\n\n\u201cWin or lose the midterms,\u201d Obst said, \u201cPence will have left nothing on the table.\u201d\n\nMore: Midterm elections 2018: Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle gin up GOP base like 'rock stars'\n\nMore: Midterm elections: Fearing loss of the House, Republicans blame each other.

All it took was an ignition source \u2013 a lit cigar \u2013 to spark the gaseous fireball that would take his life.\n\nThe 65-year-old psychiatrist was one of at least 264 people killed in natural gas leaks, fires and explosions since 1990, a USA TODAY analysis of federal data shows. More than 1,600 people have been injured.\n\nThe natural gas industry and its government regulators have known of the dangers of leaking gas pipelines for decades. After a fatal gas explosion in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1990, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended utilities replace their cast iron pipes \"in a planned, timely manner.\"\n\nTwenty-eight years later, the utilities still haven't finished the job.\n\nThe work is expensive, often difficult, and sometimes perilous. Gas crews upgrading cast iron pipe in Massachusetts in September inadvertently ignited fires and explosions that destroyed 131 buildings, killing one person, injuring 21 and leaving hundreds homeless.\n\nThat disaster \u2013 and hundreds of others across the country \u2013 illuminate the conflicting pressures on the industry as it tries to balance safety with consumer demands for cheap, convenient energy.\n\nState utility commissions are under pressure from consumer groups to keep energy rates down. Grassroots groups oppose new pipelines in their neighborhoods. And often there aren't enough qualified pipeline workers to do the work safely.\n\nUtilities replacing leaking gas pipes receive only spotty oversight from a fractured system of state and federal safety regulations. Government regulators have largely left it to the utilities to determine for themselves what their biggest safety vulnerabilities are.\n\nDecades of neglect\n\nUnderneath our feet and below our streets sit more than 2.2 million miles of pipelines that carry natural gas into our homes and businesses. They deliver a relatively cheap and clean-burning fuel that cooks our meals, heats our showers and keeps us warm.\n\nBut much of that infrastructure is old, outdated, obsolete or damaged. When the pipes leak or rupture, the consequences can be catastrophic.\n\nColumbia Gas of Massachusetts had just started work on its ambitious plan to replace cast iron gas mains in the Merrimack Valley of Northeastern Massachusetts when an alarm went off at its control center in Columbus, Ohio, on Sept. 13.\n\nPressure in the system was spiking.\n\nWithin minutes, homes across the cities of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover began to explode.\n\nFederal investigators say a work crew was given faulty orders. They were directed to remove an old pipe, but not a feedback line that alerted the system to a drop in pressure.\n\nMore: Federal prosecutors open criminal investigation into Massachusetts natural gas explosions\n\nWhen the old cast iron main was taken out of service, the system detected the loss in pressure and compensated by pumping more gas. Pressure swelled to 12 times the limit for which the system was built.\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said the episode raises serious questions about whether existing federal regulations are enough to protect the public.\n\n\"The natural gas industry needs to learn their safety lessons so this doesn\u2019t happen again,\" Markey says. \"If they don't, this will be repeated.\"\n\nThe natural gas industry says that's already happening.\n\n\"I know a game-changing incident when I see it,\" says former pipeline safety official Christina Sames, now vice president of the American Gas Association. \"And this was, in my opinion, a game-changing incident.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts explosions could become the most expensive natural gas disaster ever, for a local utility that was already spending $80 million this year to upgrade an aging infrastructure.\n\nBut all across the country, smaller, less spectacular natural gas incidents have been just as lethal.\n\n\u25ba DETROIT: Neighbors say they complained of a gas odor for days before a house on Trenton Street exploded in 2015.\n\nEugene Trump Jr., 19, was in the basement of his father\u2019s house with his girlfriend, who liked to smoke a hookah. A lighter sparked a blast that blew out the basement windows and ignited Trump\u2019s clothes.\n\n\u201cI went outside and his dad was holding him in his lap with a blanket around him,\u201d says Nicole Elliott, who lived next door. \u201cHis face was burned. His clothes were burned into his skin. His dad was burned from putting out the flames. It was gruesome.\u201d\n\nTrump died from his injuries. Crews traced the leak to a cracked 6-inch cast iron gas main installed in 1923. Trump's father reached a confidential out-of-court settlement with DTE Energy. A spokeswoman for the utility said it has no record of odor complaints before the explosion.\n\n\u25ba MINNEAPOLIS: At the Christian Minnehaha Academy last year, utility crews were moving the gas meter from the basement of one building to the outside, where it could be more easily read. As part of the work, they inadvertently disconnected an active natural gas line. Worried about a possible explosion, they fled the area.\n\nThe school exploded. It was early August, and school was not in session, but two staff members were killed and seven people were injured. Centerpoint Energy settled a lawsuit with the family of receptionist Ruth Berg, one of the victims.\n\n\u25ba MILLERSVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA: A woman out for a walk on a cul-de-sac of newer homes in Pennsylvania Dutch country last year smelled gas and called the local utility. A crew evacuated a homeowner and was searching for the leak when the house exploded, killing one worker.\n\nThe NTSB blamed an incorrectly installed mechanical joint used to tap the service line into the gas main when the subdivision was constructed in 1998.\n\nSimilar tapping tees were responsible for explosions in nearby West Lampeter Township, Pennsylvania, and in Knoxville, Tennessee, the agency said in a safety report issued in June.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission hit UGI Utilities this month with a $2 million fine for the Millersville explosion.\n\nNatural gas explosions reported to the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration since 1990 have cost at least $1.2 billion. That includes only incidents in gas distribution systems \u2013 the mains and service lines that carry gas to customers \u2013 not the larger transmission pipelines that carry gas from state to state, or leaks that occur inside homes and businesses.\n\nMore: The other cost of old pipes: Natural gas leaks take an economic and environmental toll\n\nThe incidents have a range of causes. Often, natural gas can fuel an existing fire, making it more explosive, destructive and lethal.\n\nOne common factor: Old infrastructure. Decades of freezing and thawing, corrosion, vibration and shifting soil can eat away at the cast iron and untreated steel pipes that were once the state of the art in natural gas distribution.\n\nNationally, more than 53,000 miles of natural gas mains were built before 1940. Those tired systems feed fuel to millions of homes and businesses, many of them in and around the older industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest \u2013 New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit \u2013 and places where the energy industry first boomed: Houston and Dallas.\n\nMore damage can be caused by contractors working on gas pipes or other utilities, or homeowners digging in their yards without calling the utilities first.\n\nPipes that are installed incorrectly can sit silently for years underground before becoming a problem. Leaking gas quietly builds up to just the right concentration \u2013 somewhere between 5 percent and 15 percent \u2013 before a spark or flame detonates the explosive mixture.\n\nProgress toward upgrading the infrastructure has been slow.\n\nIn 2011, then-Transportation Secretary Ray Lahood called on the industry to speed up its replacement of aging cast iron pipes and asked Congress to add more inspectors and increase penalties for violations.\n\nA USA TODAY investigation in 2014 found more than 85,000 miles of aging cast iron and bare-steel gas pipes still in use, despite decades of government warnings.\n\nBy the end of 2017, that number was 71,000.\n\nColumbia Gas of Massachusetts replaced 42 percent of its cast iron lines in the last decade, but it still had 471 miles of the old pipes at the end of last year.\n\nIn a state regulatory filing in 2017 \u2013 the year before the explosions \u2013 the utility specifically cited the difficulty in replacing pipes in older, industrial cities such as Lawrence.\n\n\"In these areas, it is unlikely that the company will be able to plan and undertake a large number of infrastructure replacement projects,\" Columbia Gas said. \"The mains and services are typically located in densely populated urban and business districts with roadways that are paved from building to building and are heavily congested with other underground utilities and structures, making installation of new main problematic,\" Columbia Gas said.\n\nReplacing old mains has its own dangers. According to the NTSB, the Massachusetts fires were caused by an error when Columbia Gas took an old line out of service.\n\nInvestigators say the utility failed to tell a work crew to disconnect a pressure-sensing system in the old line.\n\nWhen the line went out of service, the sensors detected the drop in pressure. The system compensated by increasing the flow of gas. Pressure built to more than a dozen times the level the system was built for, causing explosions and fires across three cities.\n\nMark McDonald says the catastrophe was waiting to happen. He's president of NatGas Consulting and an expert witness in lawsuits over gas explosions.\n\n\"We didn't take care of this problem for decades and decades and decades,\" he said. \"Now there's a rush to replace this infrastructure \u2013 obviously with the intent to improve the safety of the system. But not having the right safeguards and quality workers could cause more explosion hazards such as this.\"\n\n'My husband's on fire! Something blew up!'\n\nShreveport is the largest city in Northern Louisiana, a region that saw a natural gas boom in 2008 with the discovery of the Haynesville Shale. Dozens of landowners became millionaires, and the field now provides 8.5 percent of all natural gas in the United States.\n\nBut the city's history with the fuel goes back much further. A century ago, Shreveport was the terminus of Louisiana\u2019s first natural gas pipeline, a conduit from Caddo Field that fueled a community whose population almost tripled in the first two decades of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1911, a newly built cast iron gas main brought that natural gas to homes along Fairfield Avenue, then one of the city's most exclusive neighborhoods.\n\nAfter a century of service, the main began to leak.\n\nWilliams, the Shreveport psychiatrist, lived on one of the most picturesque thoroughfares in the city. But the stench caused by the natural gas leak in the neighborhood was so strong that you could smell it driving down the street.\n\nNext-door neighbor Jimmy Harris operates a bed and breakfast out of his 1905 Queen Anne home.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that concerned, because I felt like if it was a big major safety issue that the gas company would have taken care of it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a common occurrence every day, and it\u2019s just like we got numb to it.\u201d\n\nSo it's not entirely clear what Williams was thinking \u2013 or smelling \u2013 on that late July Sunday in 2016 when he lit a cigar and walked into his back yard.\n\nWilliams had smelled natural gas in his backyard before. In May 2016 \u2013 less than three months before the explosion that would take his life \u2013 he called Centerpoint Energy to report the odor of sulfur in the alley behind his house.\n\n\u201cThere were gas leaks everywhere,\u201d Harris says.Once, he says, a guest threatened to check out because she thought the smell was sewer gas.\n\nCrews fixed the service line that connected the gas main to the meter behind Williams' house. But they left a hole in the ground, covered with plywood, rocks, and caution tape.\n\nIt remained that way for weeks.\n\nIt's unclear when the gas main started to leak, but Centerpoint's own federal incident report to PHMSA blamed \"improper backfill\" of the hole.\n\nWilliams went outside at about 4 p.m. on July 31, 2016.\n\nAs Williams' wife went back into their house to grab a bottle of wine, his cigar ignited a gaseous fireball.\n\nMichelle Williams heard the explosion and called 911.\n\n\"My husband's on fire!\" she shouted into her phone. \"Something just blew up!\"\n\n\"What's on fire?\" the 911 operator said.\n\n\"My husband! He's rolling in the grass! Something blew up!\"\n\n\"What was he working on?\"\n\n\"It was leaky gas! He went to go smell it and something blew up!\" she shouted. \"I asked him to smell it and he walked out and it blew up!\n\n\"Please, he's rolling on the ground! ... Now he's getting in the pool! Something blew up!\"\n\nShe hung up to run outside with towels to extinguish the flames. She called 911 again after a storage shed containing gasoline for a lawnmower exploded.\n\n\"Oh my God, it\u2019s on fire! The whole storage room is on fire! He told me not to get near! It's getting bad! It's on fire bad! Please!\"\n\nBy the time Williams made it to his backyard swimming pool, he had suffered burns over 63 percent of his body.\n\nStill, he was conscious when help arrived. He told a firefighter that he had turned a corner and \"it exploded.\"\n\nFirefighters called the gas company. Workers found a gas main leak so large that it was visibly blowing dirt up through cracks in the pavement.\n\nHarris and at least nine others told investigators they had frequently smelled natural gas, beginning a year before and peaking in the days before the explosion.\n\nOne neighbor said she smelled a \"weird smell\" but couldn't tell what it was. Others said they couldn't pinpoint the source of the leak.\n\nPure natural gas is colorless and odorless. Some gas naturally contains a small amount of mercaptan, the chemical that gives gas its distinctive rotten egg smell. Utilities are required to add more mercaptan so people can tell when it's leaking.\n\nWilliams was taken to the intensive care burn unit at University Health Shreveport, where he underwent at least 63 medical procedures before his death, his family says in a lawsuit against Centerpoint and the City of Shreveport.\n\nWilliams eventually fell into a coma. Eighty-one days after the explosion, he died.\n\nHe was never able to give a full account of what happened.\n\nHis brother, John Williams, is a partner in a Shreveport law firm that specializes in oil and gas law and litigation. The firm is representing the Williams family in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawyers allege that Centerpoint and the city were negligent in maintaining the gas pipes. They argued in a court filing last month that the utility should pay punitive damages.\n\n\u201cCenterpoint attempts to frame Dr. Williams\u2019 death as some sort of one-time freak occurrence,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHowever, the evidence is overwhelming that Dr. Williams\u2019 death was the direct result of a systemic failure on the part of Centerpoint caused by conscious decisions made by Centerpoint\u2019s officers and executives in Texas.\"\n\n\"The systemic failure at issue,\" they wrote, \"is Centerpoint\u2019s choice not to remove dangerous cast iron pipes from its system, even though Centerpoint knew just how deadly they were.\u201d\n\nCenterpoint's lawyer, Bruce Parkerson, told USA TODAY in a statement that Centerpoint \"continues to extend its condolences to the Williams family\" and that the company \"accepts its responsibility in operating a safe and reliable system.\"\n\nBut in reports and court papers, the company says Williams himself is partly to blame. The utility also blames the city of Shreveport, which maintains the alley behind Williams' house.\n\nShreveport City Attorney William Bradford says he doesn't comment on pending litigation, but \"we do think it\u2019s a defensible claim on behalf of the city.\"\n\nThe Williams' case illustrates a challenge posed by overlapping state and federal regulations.\n\nPipeline regulations are enforced by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources through an agreement with the federal government.\n\nThat agency cited Centerpoint last year for four violations, including failing to keep operation and emergency plans up to date and conduct inspections to make sure the required amount of odor in the gas.\n\nThe maximum penalty was $10,000 per day for each citation. The state offered to settle for a one-time fine of $2,500 if Centerpoint fixed the problems \u2013 which both sides say the utility did.\n\nThe state has not cited Centerpoint for violations in the Williams case.\n\nThe Louisiana State Police filed criminal charges against Centerpoint for failing to report the gas leak to the state, but those charges were dismissed.\n\n'They can essentially regulate themselves'\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had already been prodding Congress to pass pipeline safety legislation when a natural gas fire ignited gunpowder at a gun store in Richmond, Indiana, killing 41 people in 1968.\n\nThat year, Johnson signed the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act, which set up a federal-state partnership: The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, a new agency in the U.S. Department of Transportation, would establish national standards for gas utilities, but state regulators would be responsible for enforcing those regulations.\n\nThat compromise continues to this day.\n\nCynthia Quarterman served five years as the top pipeline safety official in the Obama administration, the longest tenure in the agency's history.\n\n\"Let me put it this way: If you were to create a system from scratch today, I don't think you would create it the way it currently exists,\" she says.\n\n\"The PHMSA is not big enough to cover all those local and state programs,\" Quarterman says. \"There just aren't enough bodies to do it.\"\n\nThe current federal pipeline safety administrator, Howard \"Skip\" Elliott, declined to be interviewed.\n\nThe federal government awards grants for pipeline safety programs to regulators in the 48 states that participate, funding on average 68 percent of such programs. (Alaska and Hawaii do not conduct natural gas utility inspections. They leave pipeline safety to federal inspectors.)\n\n\"It\u2019s definitely under-supervised,\" said McDonald, the Boston-based consultant.\n\nHe worked as a leak inspector for the Boston Gas Co. for 25 years. He now serves as an expert witness in lawsuits over natural gas explosions.\n\n\"I've never seen a PHMSA investigator in my entire career,\" he says. \"I've never seen a surprise visit from any regulator \u2013 federal or state \u2013 in my entire career. So that\u2019s a problem.\"\n\nThe agency required every utility to develop a plan to replace old pipelines and make other safety improvements beginning in 2010.\n\nBut the agency doesn't inspect those documents, known as distribution integrity management plans, or DIMPs, and state oversight varies.\n\nIn many states, utilities don't have to submit the plans for approval. In others, state officials refused requests by the USA TODAY Network for copies.\n\nThe Missouri Public Service Commission voted 4-0 in September to deny a request to release the plans for Spire Energy, after the company cited \"system safety and security\" concerns.\n\nIn Louisiana, as in many states, regulators look at the plans but do not keep copies. That protects the documents from disclosure under freedom of information laws, allowing utilities to keep their contents a closely guarded secret.\n\nThe result, critics say, is a broken oversight system with little transparency and no one clearly in charge.\n\nMarkey, who sits on the Senate committee that oversees gas pipeline regulations, says that needs to change.\n\n\"What industries attempt to accomplish is to create a regulatory black hole where neither federal nor state regulators have clear supervisory responsibility. And that is in large part what his happening here,\" he says. \"Going forward after this incident, we just can't let pipeline companies regulate themselves.\"\n\nNew Jersey has more than 70,000 miles of gas pipelines \u2013 nearly double the length of all public roads in the state. Its largest utility, Public Service Electric & Gas, has more cast iron pipleline than any utility in the country.\n\nPSE&G said it stopped using the leak-prone cast iron pipes in the 1960s and has replaced about 42 percent of them since then, reducing the number of leaks to about 8,000 per year \u2013 less than one leak for every 4 miles of pipeline.\n\nLynda Farrell says that's not good enough.\n\nShe heads the Pipeline Safety Coalition, an advocacy group based in suburban Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cNationally we\u2019re in pretty damned bad shape, not only when it comes to the consistency of regulations but also in having the needed powers to regulate,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reason for the absence of that regulation is simply that the industry has always written the safety regulations.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the industry has lobbied against additional regulations. Industry officials say the best way to upgrade their systems is to give local utilities the flexibility to address their own unique problems.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump signed an executive order last year inviting industry groups to propose regulations to be eliminated, the natural gas industry asked that inspection schedules be governed not by federal regulations, but by the industry's own risk-based rankings of their highest priorities.\n\nNisource, the parent company of Columbia Gas, said the government often issues \"well intentioned\" regulations that might resolve lower-risk safety issues but divert resources away from replacing what it sees as its highest priority: replacing cast iron pipe.\n\n\"Each operating system is unique,\" Nisource lawyers Kimberly Cuccia and Joseph Clark wrote to the Department of Transportation. \"Operators must have the flexibility to focus their resources on their highest risks, which ultimately ensures the best value in terms of cost and safety for all customers and the general public.\"\n\nAn isolated incident?\n\nElizabeth Rueve-Miller is the co-founder of NOPE \u2013 Neighbors Opposing Pipeline Extension. The group is protesting plans for a new high-pressure distribution pipeline through Cincinnati and its suburbs.\n\nShe was waiting for her turn to speak at a suburban city council meeting in September when a flurry of text messages alerted her to the Massachusetts explosions.\n\n\u201cA failure involving something like that would be devastating,\u201d Rueve-Miller says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against natural gas. I\u2019m against irresponsible infrastructure. We\u2019re concerned about people\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nIt's a classic not-in-my-backyard dilemma.\n\nDuke Energy says it needs the new pipeline to keep up with growing demand for energy, and to replace smaller lines built in the 1940s, \u201950s and \u201960s.\n\nBut the preferred routes for the line run through as many as a dozen communities and neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe looked at literally thousands upon thousands of options,\u201d Duke spokeswoman Sally Thelen says. \u201cWe are very confident in our safety record.\u201d\n\nHarris, the Shreveport bed-and-breakfast owner, said he just has to trust his gas company to operate a safe system despite what happened next door two years ago.\n\n\u201cI know gas is dangerous, but I just don\u2019t look at it as our responsibility to fix it,\" he said. \u201cI still in my mind assume that basically the companies are looking out for our safeties and to me that was an isolated incident.\n\n\u201cI guess I should be more diligent about things like that.\u201d\n\nLoading...\n\nGregory Korte reported from McLean, Virginia.

But what is birthright citizenship? And why was it added to the Constitution? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWe should protect our borders and our country by ending birthright citizenship. The framers never intended for it, anyway.\n\nIn Houston on July 1, 2011. (Photo: Michael Paulsen)\n\nBirthright citizenship is foolish, uncommon and unconstitutional. Let\u2019s take those in reverse order.\n\nMany assume that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires granting birthright citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. That\u2019s wrong.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was intended to guarantee the citizenship of freed black slaves and their descendants. Before the Civil War, there had been no federal definition of citizenship. After the war, some states tried to use that fact to deny citizenship to freed slaves. In response, Congress first passed a law and later the amendment \u2014 subsequently ratified by all then-existing states \u2014 to clarify the issue forever.\n\nFramers didn't intend for birthright citizenship\n\nThe amendment specifies that \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d If the framers simply intended to make citizens of any person born in U.S. territory, then that central clause has no purpose.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t, and it does. It\u2019s there to clarify that simply being born here is not enough. An early draft of the amendment lacked the jurisdiction clause, prompting some to ask whether the amendment amounted to a grant of citizenship to anyone born here regardless of status. The drafters immediately answered no: Only those \u201cnot owing allegiance to anybody else\u201d and \u201cnot subject to some foreign power\u201dare automatically granted birthright citizenship.\n\nMore: Trump plan for birthright citizenship executive order will force courts to act. That's good.\n\nMore: Trump challenges Constitution with talk of an executive order to end birthright citizenship: Today's talker\n\nMore: Trump is right to stop illegal alien caravan instead of rolling out welcome mat\n\nHence the Constitution sets two criteria for citizenship: birth or naturalization, and subject to our jurisdiction. Ignoring the latter is therefore unconstitutional.\n\nSo how did we get where we are? It\u2019s a long story but in brief, one side of the political debate long ago decided, for its own advantage, to pretend as if the amendment doesn\u2019t mean what it says. There is nothing in the Constitution or in statute law that gives the federal government authority to grant citizenship to people not entitled to it. Federal agencies simply do it, the same way they do so many things they have no authority to do. It\u2019s one of thousands of examples of our runaway, undemocratic, unelected bureaucracy acting in concert with liberal interests. There\u2019s no reason why the elected president couldn\u2019t tell the agencies that report to him to stop doing something nobody ever told them to do in the first place.\n\nBirthright citizenship is rare because it's foolish\n\nBirthright citizenship is not common. Of the 197 countries in the world, only 33 honor birthright citizenship.\n\nBirthright citizenship is rare because it is foolish. In our country, for instance, it has led to ridiculous abuses such as \u201cbirth tourism.\u201d Relatively affluent women spend tens of thousands of dollars to have their babies in America so they can take junior home with a U.S. passport and citizenship, guaranteeing the whole family American residency whenever they want it. Partially in response to this abuse, eight countries have curtailed or ended the practice in recent years; zero has adopted it. Canada \u2014 the only other wealthy country that allows birthright citizenship \u2014 is debating it just as we are.\n\nPresident Trump has wisely said that \u201cif you don\u2019t have borders, you don\u2019t have a country.\u201d Similarly, if breaking our law is sufficient to make someone a citizen, then the citizenship of all lawful citizens is weakened and the meaning of citizenship is trivialized.\n\nMichael Anton is a lecturer in politics and research fellow at the Hillsdale College Kirby Center and a former national security official in the Trump administration.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Penney and Neiman Marcus are ailing, while strip-mall stalwarts Kmart and Bed Bath & Beyond are struggling to lure customers. And flailing mall retailers such as Claire's and Charlotte Russe must deliver results.\n\nMany major retailers are already showing signs of suffocation. Seventeen have defaulted on their debts since the start of 2017, including Sears, Payless, GNC, Rue 21, Bon-Ton Stores and David's Bridal, according to S&P Global Ratings.\n\nEven during the financial crisis, it wasn\u2019t this bad. Only five defaulted in 2009 and five in 2010, the worst individual years until 2017.\n\nCompanies that fail to pay their debts on originally promised terms qualify as defaulters and are often considered at serious risk of bankruptcy \u2013 if they\u2019re not already there.\n\nEven with consumer confidence notching an 18-year high, many retailers can't get traction.\n\n\u201cWith the economy doing pretty well and consumer spending doing pretty well, these companies \u2026 are still defaulting\u201d because of their sagging business prospects, said S&P Global Ratings managing director Robert Schulze, who tracks retail.\n\nIt's not all bad.\n\nFlourishing apparel retailers like T.J. Maxx and Marshalls \u2013 part of parent company TJX Companies \u2013 as well as adaptable specialty chains like Best Buy are proving that retailers can succeed when they cater to their customers. TJX has generated loyal customers with its treasure-hunt-style shopping experience, while Best Buy has nicely integrated its digital and physical stores.\n\nMore: Black Friday, Cyber Monday have best deals.

Vacancy rates at regional and super-regional malls hit 8.6 percent in the second quarter, marking a six-year high, according to a recent survey by commercial real estate data source Reis.\n\nAmazon, Walmart and Target aren't showing mercy. During the 2017 holiday shopping season, they dialed up discounts in an attempt to put Toys R Us out of business after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the toy retailer alleged.\n\nUnable to keep pace, Toys R Us ended up posting a poor holiday season and liquidating in 2018.\n\nHere are several key retailers that can't afford a bad holiday season this year:\n\n1. Sears and Kmart\n\nThis is the most obvious example. Parent company Sears Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October after years of sales declines, ballooning debt, steep pension costs and a failure to adapt to digital competition.\n\nThe company, which is already closing 188 of its remaining 687 stores, is at serious risk of total liquidation if it can\u2019t obtain new financing and reach a restructuring deal with its creditors.\n\nA glimmer of hope in the holiday season could go a long way in proving that Sears deserves a second chance.\n\nBut competitors may try to capitalize on the company\u2019s troubles, Schulze said. For example, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s could try to lure appliance buyers who otherwise would have shopped at Sears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for Sears to have a good holiday just because of their so-far stated plan to reorganize and emerge,\u201d he said.\n\nSears declined to comment for this story.\n\nAs a department store, Sears is stuck in a sector that has struggled to define its appeal to customers in the digital age.\n\nAnd as a discount retailer, the company\u2019s Kmart chain hasn\u2019t been able to keep pace with its much more powerful rivals \u2013 Amazon, Walmart and Target \u2013 not to mention dollar stores and other nimble competitors.\n\nFILE - In this May 16, 2018, photo, the J.C.

The company\u2019s stock plunged below $2 in August and has continued to drift downward.\n\nAfter CEO Marvin Ellison suddenly left the company in the spring to become CEO of Lowe's, investors feared J.C. Penney was rudderless at the worst time. The company named former Joann Stores CEO Jill Soltau as its new CEO effective Oct. 15, but her ability to make an impact on the holidays is likely limited since it's too late to dramatically alter the company's strategy.\n\nStill, she might be the company\u2019s last hope at a true turnaround.\n\n\u201cJ.C. Penney has had a lot of change and continues to try to address its apparel,\u201d said Christina Boni, a Moody's Investors Service vice president, who tracks retail. \u201cThey have new management, but obviously these things take time to make changes.\"\n\nThe company\u2019s foray into appliances and toys haven\u2019t paid off yet. While in-store beauty partner Sephora has helped deliver foot traffic, J.C. Penney faces a similar challenge as Sears: defining its appeal to customers in a digital age that has diminished the usefulness of variety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how do you recreate the magic of retail?\u201d said Greg Portell, lead partner in the global consumer and retail practice of A.T.

Much of that infrastructure is old, outdated, or damaged, and leaks or ruptures could have catastrophic consequences. Scott Hall, USA TODAY\n\nIn this Sept. 13, 2018 file image take from video provided by WCVB in Boston, flames consume the roof of a home following an explosion in Lawrence, Mass., following an overpressurization of gas pipes caused by work crews replacing cast-iron pipe. (Photo: AP)\n\nThe catastrophic explosions that rocked northeastern Massachusetts last month have drawn new attention to the problems of an aging natural gas infrastructure that's prone to dangerous \u2013 and sometimes fatal \u2013 gas leaks.\n\nUSA TODAY reported on the problems of aging natural gas pipelines in 2014 and found that leaking cast-iron mains were a primary cause of natural gas fires and explosions.\n\nBut despite a call to action that year from then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, replacing those pipes has been slow \u2013 and sometimes as perilous as the pipes themselves.\n\nA new USA TODAY investigation of natural gas pipeline safety, based on federal data and interviews with industry, experts and regulators, found spotty oversight and a lack of transparency by utilities and regulators responsible for keeping gas customers safe.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nVulnerable cast-iron gas mains still exist\n\nDespite decades of warnings about the dangers of cast-iron gas mains, many local utilities still haven't replaced all of their old \u2013 and increasingly fragile \u2013 cast-iron and bare steel gas mains.\n\nIn 2014, USA TODAY found that more than 85,000 miles of gas mains still used those outdated pipes. By the end of 2017, the number was 71,000.\n\nThat's progress, but consider this: Congress first passed the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act in 1968, after a disaster in Richmond, Indiana, killed 41 people. And in 1990, after another disaster in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that utilities replace the old pipes \"in a planned, timely manner.\"\n\nThe industry is largely self-regulated\n\nPipeline safety in the United States is both a federal and state responsibility: The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sets national standards, but they're enforced state by state. \"I've never seen a PHMSA investigator in my entire career,\" says Mark McDonald, a former Boston Gas worker who now is a safety consultant. \"So that\u2019s a problem.\"\n\nBeginning in 2010, the federal pipeline agency asked utilities to develop their own plans \u2013 known as distribution integrity management plans \u2013 to make their systems safer. But those plans aren't filed with federal regulators, and states often allow utilities to keep them secret, so there's little transparency about how utilities are managing the risk.\n\n\"What industries attempt to accomplish is to create a regulatory black hole where neither federal nor state regulators have clear supervisory responsibility. And that is in large part what is happening here,\" says Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. \"We just can't let pipeline companies regulate themselves.\"\n\nReplacing pipelines is difficult\n\nEven before the Sept. 13 explosions in northeastern Massachusetts, Columbia Gas warned state regulators that replacing pipes in places like Lawrence would be difficult.\n\nThe pipelines were in densely populated areas dominated by paved surfaces. They're intertwined with other utilities in crowded rights of way. Local regulations often restrict street closures and hours of work, and near-record low unemployment makes it difficult to find qualified workers, the utility said.\n\nUtilities across the country face pressure from state regulators to keep gas rates low, to limit the effect on low-income customers. And grassroots groups oppose big pipeline projects in their neighborhoods.\n\n\"We didn't take care of this problem for decades and decades and decades,\" McDonald says. \"Now there's a rush to replace this infrastructure \u2013 obviously with the intent to improve the safety of the system. But not having the right safeguards and quality workers could cause more explosion hazards such as this.\"\n\nEconomic and environmental costs\n\nGas leaks aren't just dangerous. They're also expensive and damaging to the earth.\n\nOne Environmental Protection Agency estimate in 2014 put the annual cost of the leaked gas itself at $194 million a year. And under a 1936 Supreme Court decision, utilities can pass 100 percent of that cost to consumers \u2013 even if the gas never reaches their meters.\n\nMethane, the primary component of pure natural gas, is also a powerful greenhouse gas, as much as 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. The good news, environmental groups say, is that methane breaks up in the atmosphere more quickly, so fixing gas leaks could have an immediate effect toward meeting global emission-reduction goals.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/01/natural-gas-pipelines-fires-explosions-short-version-tldr-lawrence-massachusetts/1830443002/", "CLOSE Robert Bowers is accused of shouting anti-semitic epithets during the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.

He shouted anti-Semitic epithets and started shooting.\n\nAs in his first court appearance Wednesday, Bowers pleaded not guilty and requested a jury trial. This time, however, Bowers \u2013 who was shot and wounded in a gunbattle that left four police officers injured \u2013 walked into court, without the aid of a wheelchair.\n\nUnshackled, the stocky truck driver shook hands with his attorney and appeared to be looking at the indictment. He glanced around the room while walking to the table but said nothing.\n\nAs proceedings opened, Bowers frowned as the charges were read but did not appear to react as U.S. Attorney Troy Rivetti announced he could face a death sentence.\n\nHe told the prosecutor that he had read the indictment and, when asked if he understood the charges, said \u201cYes!\u201d in a loud voice.\n\nDuring the brief court appearance, U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Robert Mitchell also granted a 45-day pretrial motion period.\n\nRivetti estimated that the trial would likely last three to four weeks unless Attorney General Jeff Sessions certifies it as a capital case, which would make it longer.\n\nIn addition to those killed, two in the synagogue were wounded. Police arrived, and four officers and Bowers were wounded in a massacre.\n\nFunerals were planned Thursday for Bernice and Sylvan Simon, husband and wife, and Dr. Richard Gottfried, a dentist who worked part time at a clinic treating refugees and immigrants. The oldest victim, 97-year-old Rose Mallinger, will be honored at a service Friday.

This bucked the usual action of quiet action.\n\n\u2022 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called for an emergency conference call to get a handle on the roughing-the-passer emphasis that has dumbfounded sack artists and others.. Since then, such calls have decreased \u2026 and Clay Matthews, the Packers\u2019 top pass-rusher, hasn\u2019t been flagged again for roughing.\n\n\u2022 Dolphins defensive end William Hayes suffered a season-ending torn ACL while trying avoid putting too much body weight on Raiders quarterback Derek Carr. Chiefs rookie linebacker Breeland Speaks, on the other hand, maintained that he released his grasp on Tom Brady because he feared drawing a penalty (like what in the name of \u201cMean Joe\u201d Greene?).\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s been a lot of mail flowing to players from 345 Park Avenue in the form of \u201cwarning letters\u201d stemming from the new \u201chelmet\u201d rule. While the flood of penalties called in the preseason for using the head to initiate contact has trickled to a drip with just eight penalties league-wide through the first seven weeks (in addition to seven fines), the NFL fired off 69 letters that warned players to cease and desist.

That\u2019s just part of it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Tomlin\u2019s remarks resonated within the league office as the type of constructive criticism that many other coaches in the league probably would also offer, Blandino defends the general quality of officiating and maintains that \u201cofficiating doesn\u2019t significantly improve or get worse from year to year.\u201d Still, he allows that some of the struggles are related to the new landscape.\n\n\u201cIn the officiating world, there\u2019s always going to be negativity surrounding it,\u201d Blandino told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThere are 40,000 plays a year and we only tend to talk about 10 or 15 per year. In the big picture, it\u2019s not that much. But it does tend to stand out.\u201d\n\nNo, the officials aren\u2019t perfect. Human error, like it or not, is part of the game. Quarterbacks sometimes miss open receivers. Cornerbacks grab jerseys. Officials miss calls. But the consternation is increased when we\u2019re treated to head-scratching calls \u2013 or non-calls.\n\nThe \u201chelmet rule\u201d is supposed to work both ways. It sure didn\u2019t, for instance, when Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt rumbled down the sideline and lowered his head on a Broncos defender. Of the warning letters the NFL has sent, 17 went to offensive players. Let\u2019s guess that Hunt received one.\n\nStill, there\u2019s been too much guesswork.

USA TODAY\n\nTwo NFL owners, while also citing the transition phase with the two key rules, told USA TODAY Sports that they would not rule out the possibility of some effect linked to turnover in the officiating ranks. There are four new referees heading the 17 crews this season, the second year since Al Riveron was promoted to replace Blandino. In addition to the referees promoted from within, the league has ushered in 15 new game officials the past two years.\n\n\u201cIn general, you\u2019d rather not have that much turnover,\u201d Steelers owner Art Rooney II told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s fair to say. We\u2019ve had probably more than we would like. So, it\u2019s going to take a while for some of the new people to adjust.\u201d\n\nRooney sounds a lot like, well, his coach and so many others around the league in expressing the end game.\n\n\u201cYou want consistency, where everybody knows what to expect,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThose are the things we\u2019ve got to work through.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t blame the NFL for trying, given the criticism stemming from an increased awareness of the long-term effects of concussions and head injuries. Sure, the league needed to fix the catch rule, but the vast majority of tweaks in recent years have been related to safety.\n\nThat effort was underscored this week during a summit at NFL headquarters, with key league and team officials converging with similar influencers from the NCAA level, drawn together to look at ways to align player protection rules.\n\nNow let\u2019s hope that they\u2019ve worked the kinks out and can lighten up on the confusion as the NFL rolls down the stretch. The last thing we\u2019d want to see is a key game \u2013 or say, a playoff spot \u2013 enveloped by the controversy of an officiating call.\n\nIn that regard, no news would be good news for the NFL.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.", "", "bad url", "CLOSE Chances are, you love fast food - A 2017 study of 8,000 adults found that 80% of adults had eaten fast food at least once a week - so here are a few ways to make it healthier!

And that can drive sales.\n\nMany of the tweets are strictly business, but some aren't afraid to zing, offering quips that mock competitors or pick up on news events, causing a stir among fans.\n\nBurger King offered a promotion in June in which customers could trade \"their\" fries for its onion rings -- clearly taking aim at archrival McDonald's. Why? The tweet explained, \"because we have them and they don't.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, fast-food chains now have their own writers' rooms, akin to the teams that bang out dialogue for TV comedies or hash out ad copy. Only these teams work on Twitter, limited to 280 characters and always aware of the challenge of being creative without embarrassing the brand.\n\nThe goal, just like the fare on their menus, is to satisfy Twitter-hungry fans think it's a mano-a-mano dialogue with a company they now think of as their friend.\n\nMore: China files complaint to WTO over US plan for tariffs on $200 billion of goods\n\nMore: Breast-feeding is cheaper than the bottle but don't think it's free\n\nMore: Tempted to buy an Amazon tablet or Fire TV?

Others, such as Burger King and Del Taco, peek out from time to time with a well-placed blast of humor.\n\n\"Twitter itself is a very modern and direct way to talk one-on-one with people,\" said Wendy's chief marketing officer Kurt Kane. \"It\u2019s always a way to have a lot of fun and engage in a lighthearted way.\"\n\nThe Dublin, Ohio-based company's social-media team consists of five men and women in their 20s and 30s, plus an outside advertising-marketing agency. Perhaps not surprisingly, one moonlights as a stand-up comic. The cute-without-being-cutesy quintet have a variety of interests from pro wrestling and movies to fashion and music, which enables them to think outside the box \u2013 and toward a punchline.\n\nThe group meets often to discuss what social-media ideas they like and don't like. In the case of an unexpected jab from another chain, the timeline is sped up, like the response to IHOP's faux-name change in June and McDonald's nascent embrace of non-frozen beef in March.\n\nWendy's Twitter voice was honed by a woman named Amy Brown during her 2012-2017 tenure. Over time, she discovered that the best quips -- after \"internal back-and-forth whether to respond\" -- came from reacting to others in the Twittersphere.\n\n\"A user started saying, 'Wendy\u2019s, do you have anything to say about this?,'\" recalled Brown, now the social media lead for the food delivery company Postmates.\n\nDel Burgers? Yes. Changing our name to Del Burger? No. pic.twitter.com/ZHH4Rx2ZtZ \u2014 Del Taco Restaurants (@DelTaco) June 12, 2018\n\nA witty jab on Twitter at just the right moment is key. The snarkier, the better. Knives are drawn \u2013 but because it\u2019s fast food, they're made of disposable plastic.\n\nAll were at their best \u2013 or worst, depending on how you see it \u2013 in doing their best to steal thunder from IHOP's June promotion in which it pretended to change its name to IHOb, with the \"b\" standing for burgers.\n\nWendy's taunted: \"Remember when you were like 7 and thought changing your name to Thunder BearSword would be super cool? Like that, but our cheeseburgers are still better.\"\n\nRemember when you were like 7 and thought changing your name to Thunder BearSword would be super cool?\n\nLike that, but our cheeseburgers are still better. \u2014 Wendy's (@Wendys) June 11, 2018\n\nKane called it \"a tongue-in-cheek way of saying we don\u2019t think IHOP is committed to serving great quality burgers.\"\n\nBrand awareness via those moments on social media has bottom-line value -- with little expenditure.\n\n\"What did it cost Wendy's to respond? What did it cost Chili's to respond? Nothing,\" said Peter Shankman, author of Zombie Loyalists: Using Great Service to Create Rabid Fans. \"It allowed them to piggyback.

Here\u2019s what you need to know. Kim Komando, For USA Today\n\nNo one likes to see \"Buffering....\" light up their devices' screen. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nCorrections & clarifications: A previous version of the story misstated a measurement of Internet speed.\n\nWe know what \u201cslow\u201d internet is like: videos buffer, downloads lag and a single page can take forever to appear in its entirety. We wonder whether it\u2019s our browser, our device or the website we\u2019re visiting.\n\nYou may suspect your Wi-Fi signal. Wireless networks are notorious for connection problems. So how can you pinpoint the issue?\n\nYour first step is to check your connection speed. Afterward, compare the results of the test to the speed advertised by your internet provider.\n\nNote: Make sure no one in your home network is doing bandwidth-hogging tasks like file downloads, file sharing, video streaming, video chats, etc. You don\u2019t want any activity within your control to be skewing results.\n\nMore: 6 ways mobile apps can change \u2013 or even save \u2013 your life\n\nMeasuring internet speed\n\nInternet speed typically is measured in \u201cmegabits per second,\u201d or Mbps. You should know what this number means, and even that this measurement exists. Every provider promises different tiers of internet speed rates; usually the pricier the plan, the faster your internet should be.\n\n\u2022 1-3 Mbps: Good enough for web surfing, email, social, casual online gaming (if you don\u2019t mind some latency) and email. However, this is not ideal for video streaming.\n\n\u2022 3-4 Mbps: This is the minimum speed for standard video streaming from services like Netflix. This speed may be enough for a one-computer household, but with all the HD content that\u2019s available on the web right now, this will lead to constant video buffering.\n\n\u2022 5-10 Mbps: Netflix recommends at least 5 Mbps for a single HD stream, and you\u2019ll double that for two simultaneous HD streams. Although this is the baseline speed that is required for HD content, it could still lead to buffering especially if you have multiple connected gadgets at home.\n\n\u2022 10-20 Mbps: This is the minimum speed for a consistent and reliable internet experience. If you continuously download files from the web and cloud storage services, get a plan with this advertised speed at the very least.\n\n\u2022 20 Mbps and higher: Now we\u2019re talking. Households with multiple computers and gadgets, video streaming services, smart appliances, and simultaneous users should aim for at least a 20 Mbps plan.\n\nMore: Top skills for Alexa: 6 tips for your Amazon Echo that will simplify your life\n\nServices that test internet speed\n\nNow that you have an idea what internet speed is required for certain activities, test your actual bandwidth and compare it to your provider\u2019s advertised speed.\n\nHere is a list of the most popular sites to use. It\u2019s a good idea to conduct the test at more than one site. Your mileage may vary.\n\nOokla Speedtest\n\nOne of the most well-known internet speed test services available is Ookla Speedtest. This service can measure your connection\u2019s ping response, and download and upload speeds from a remote server.\n\nAs for download and upload speeds, measurements are given in bits per second. Higher numbers are better. Download speeds will typically be much faster than upload speeds.\n\nYou can also compare these numbers against the speeds that your internet service provider promises you. Be sure to run multiple tests over several days at different times. This will give you an overall picture of your connection speed. You also might find specific periods when it\u2019s slow, depending on your area\u2019s network congestion.\n\nMore: What you need to know about Google's personalized ads and how to turn them off\n\nFast.com\n\nInterestingly, Netflix has its internet speed test called Fast.com.\n\nFast.com is entirely browser-based, so you don\u2019t have to download an app or program. Just point your web-based or mobile browser to Fast.com and the test will automatically run and show your download speed when it\u2019s done.\n\nFor more details about your connection, tap or click the \u201cShow more info\u201d box. This will show your latency, upload speeds and the servers used for the test.\n\nSpeedOf.Me\n\nAnother excellent web-based speed test is SpeedOf.Me. What\u2019s great about this tool is the real-time graph that tracks the fluctuations in the speeds while the test is running. It can also provide you with a graphical history of all the tests you\u2019ve run for comparison.\n\nOther tests you can try\n\nOther alternative speed tests can be accessed straight on the search engine of your choice. For example, search for the keywords \u201cspeed test\u201d on Google and the first hit will show Google\u2019s very own speed test tool.\n\nThe same service is available from Bing. Just search for \u201cspeed test\u201d via Bing and the first result is a handy speedometer-style internet speed tool that measures ping response plus download and upload speeds.\n\nTips for more accurate results\n\nWhenever available, always use a wired connection for more accurate and consistent results. Why? The culprit of your slower speeds may lie on your Wi-Fi connection and not on your ISP connection itself.\n\nDo multiple tests and if the average of the results is only about 5-10 Mbps off, then that should be tolerable. Factors like congestion during peak times and your distance from the relay hardware will contribute to slight variations on your speed. (For more accuracy, you could turn your Wi-Fi radios off during the wired tests.)\n\nIf your wired results are way lower than advertised, a consistent 20 to 30 Mbps difference, perhaps, then there might be something else going on.\n\nCheck your hardware first and see if it\u2019s compatible with your provider\u2019s recommendations. For example, older DOCSIS 2.0 modems can\u2019t go beyond 38 Mbps. If you have a rate plan of 50 Mbps and above, better upgrade your modem to DOCSIS 3.0.\n\nWhat if you already have newer hardware and you\u2019re still seeing less-than-advertised speeds? Then check your network for unauthorized devices that may be stealing your bandwidth.\n\nIf you do find Wi-Fi thieves, better kick them off then change your network password quick!\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?

I lived, but my life was changed forever.\n\nA woman stands at a memorial outside the Tree of Life synagogue after a shooting there left 11 people dead in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh on October 27. (Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs I saw the news break of the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, an all-too-familiar pit formed in my stomach. And not just because we\u2019ve seen this same story unfold over and over again in the last months and years, but because I knew what lay ahead for the victims and survivors. I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve experienced the trauma of being targeted in a hate crime.\n\nTwelve years ago, I never really thought about gun violence or how gun violence is linked to hate crimes. It certainly never occurred to me to think about, prepare for, or rehearse how to respond if someone ever threatened me with a gun, especially while at work in 2006 at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle, a charitable fundraising organization for Jewish community organizations.\n\nThen, the unthinkable happened. An armed man forced his way into my workplace and shot me and five of my co-workers, killing my colleague Pam Waechter z\u201dl (may her memory be a blessing) as she was trying to escape the building.\n\nAmerica's gun violence crisis\n\nI was shot once \u2014 a point-blank-range shot to my abdomen. The hollow-point bullet exploded through my gut. Luckily, I lived. But my life was forever changed, as were the lives of my co-workers who were shot and wounded, and all of our co-workers who witnessed this tragedy firsthand. I was rushed to the hospital and underwent emergency trauma surgery. I was in the hospital for six weeks and in severe pain through all of it. Three years and 20 surgeries later, I was finally fully healed, physically. But the emotional and physical scars never go away.\n\nMore: I'm grieving in Pittsburgh. But private grief can't bring change \u2014 only public mourning can.\n\nI can't vote \u2014 I'm undocumented. So I work my butt off getting eligible Latinos to the polls.\n\nHow do we fight anti-Semitism in 2018? Show up for Shabbat, stand with Jewish neighbors.\n\nIt took me six years after the shooting to realize I wanted to be involved in gun violence prevention. The more I learned, a common thread began to emerge \u2014 hate armed with a gun turns terribly deadly.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a synagogue in Pennsylvania, a historically black church in South Carolina, or a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, it is too often the case that people simply practicing their faith are put in the middle of our nation\u2019s gun violence crisis. Nobody should have to live like this, and nobody should have to die like this. No American should be targeted by a hate-filled gunman for their faith.\n\nFrom 2006 through 2015, an average of more than 10,300 hate crimes a year in America involved a firearm on the scene, according to Everytown for Gun Safety's analysis of Bureau of Justice Statistics data. That's more than 28 each day. According to 2016 FBI data on hate crimes, 21 percent are attacks motivated by bias against a religion, most often anti-Semitism or anti-Islamic prejudice.\n\nIn the words of Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who wrote recently about gun violence and other issues that too quickly get passed over by the news cycle, \u201cWe deserve better.\u201d We deserve better gun laws. We deserve to live free from the fear of being shot in our places of worship and common community. And we deserve better leaders who will stand up for the safety of our communities.\n\nDisarm hate, tighten lax gun laws\n\nWe can\u2019t throw up our hands and give up. We can\u2019t resort to thinking nothing can be done except arming every American to the teeth. I know America is better than that.\n\nSome might say it\u2019s too soon to talk about politics and policy. To that I say: It is far too late. It is too late for my colleague whose life was taken far too early, and it is too late for the 11 people who were shot and killed last weekend in Pittsburgh simply for practicing their faith.\n\nThis terrifying shooting must be a reminder that our status quo of lax gun laws is unacceptable.\n\nAs someone who has lived through a hateful act of gun violence, and will live with the impact of a shooting for the rest of my life, I know at a visceral level that I don\u2019t want anyone else to have to experience this.\n\nMy heart goes out to the victims\u2019 families, the Jewish community, the Pittsburgh community, and all those who have been targeted just for practicing their faith. But I know thoughts and prayers simply aren\u2019t enough.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen all too clearly, we must act to disarm hate like what we saw on full display at Tree of Life.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to elect lawmakers who will put our safety first. On Tuesday, Americans across the country will head to the polls. We must honor victims and survivors of gun violence by voting for leaders who are on the side of gun safety \u2014 not the gun lobby. Our lives depend on it.\n\nCheryl Stumbo is a survivor of the 2006 shooting at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle.

In the end, Bellarabi received a four-week suspension.\n\nThe 28-year-old Bellarabi made his comeback as a late substitute against Hannover and he salvaged a 2-2 draw with the equalizer in the fourth minute of injury time. He then scored two goals in the 3-2 win at FC Zurich in the Europa League before his superb performances in Bremen and Moenchengladbach.\n\nThe latest results ease the pressure on Leverkusen coach Heiko Herrlich after a lackluster start to the season. Herrlich played his part in getting the best back from Bellarabi, who collapsed due to the heat in a pre-season friendly and hadn't made an impact once the season began.\n\n\"We had a lot of talks. There are things that I also demanded of him last year that he's putting into place now,\" Herrlich said. \"I hope his run lasts a bit longer.\"\n\nBellarabi's return - and his return to form - appears to have lifted teammates like Julian Brandt, Kai Havertz and Kevin Volland, too.

(Photo: Amy Harris, Amy Harris/Invision/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Before Mac Miller died at age 26 of an apparent overdose on September 7, he was scheduled to play a show on Halloween at the Greek Theatre. On Wednesday night, a version of that show went on without him, in his honor.\n\nThe new concert, titled Mac Miller: A Celebration of Life, brought together Miller's musician friends, with the proceeds going toward a charity formed in Miller's honor, Mac Miller Circles Fund (MMCF).\n\nSo what's the best way to pay tribute to a musician who was gone, suddenly, way too soon? Here's how stars including John Mayer, Travis Scott, SZA and Chance the Rapper helped do it in a loving way.\n\nMusicians played Miller's songs and songs about him.\n\nFor example, Mayer played a cover of Miller's \"Small Worlds,\" and even kept the late artist's voice on part of the backing track.\n\nVince Staples performed his song with Miller, \"Rain,\" and Miller's voice was heard rapping the lyrics.\n\nAnderson .Paak drummed and sang \"Dang!\" \u2013 even though he knew it would \"hurt\" to play his song with Miller.\n\nMiguel duetted with Miller's disembodied voice on \"Weekend.\"\n\nTy Dolla $ign, who later jumped into the crowd and slammed an electric guitar, sang his Miller collaboration \"Cinderella.\"\n\nNjomza sang a new tune that seemed to be about Miller, with lyrics that likely referenced his latest album \"Swimming,\" and included lyrics like \"I call your name and hear no sound.\"\n\nScHoolboy Q played \"THat Part,\" which, he says, was partially written when Miller was in the studio with him.\n\nVideos showed Miller's sense of humor.\n\nSeveralvideo montages had clips of Miller dancing goofy, joke-singing Creed songs, saying that his mom's \"shoe game is on point,\" smiling and making everyone around him laugh.\n\nSingers spoke lovingly.\n\nFamous friends from Donald Glover to Jason Sudeikis paid tribute to Miller via video, but several singers also spoke onstage about the artist who had brought them together.\n\nChance the Rapper said after his set, choking up, \"Mac, thank you for so many different things. Thank you for the music you made; thank you for the music that you provided other people with, for the opportunities that you provided me with, but overall, for the friendships that you built through your music and through your artistry.\"\n\n\"Without Mac, there would be no me, like half of us (performing),\" said SZA. \"God bless you we love you so much. Mac.\"\n\n\"Mac Miller, my brother, never took himself too seriously, ya know? One of the... funniest people I\u2019ve ever met,\" Anderson .Paak told the crowd. \"He wasn\u2019t afraid to be like, 'Yo, you dope, too, come with me.\"\n\nThere was no focus on drugs or a famous ex.\n\nIn some news reports about Miller's passing, the late artist's relationship status with Ariana Grande overshadowed his music career. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, there was no mention of the pop star, and also no attention given to Miller's cause of death. Instead, the three-hour concert was all about how Miller, born Malcolm James McCormick, treated his friends and made his music.\n\nTravis Scott, the evening's final performer, described the event simply: \"The key word to this whole thing is ... 'love.' \" He added, \"I just want everybody to stay strong. If you have a friend with you, you should always tell them you love them.\"\n\nActually, Mac Miller was the final performer.\n\nBefore the stage lights went off, Miller performed in a video clip, accompanying himself on the piano. Then, his voice was heard singing \"Best Day Ever\" and telling the crowd goodbye and goodnight. A final spotlight shone on a lone mic stand.

USA TODAY\n\nYoung voters have the potential to be a force to reckon with, but only if they're able to overcome the obstacle barring them from relevance: apathy.\n\nLanae Erickson, Madeleine Balestrier, Alyssa Archie, Layla Zaidane, Brad Polumbo, Emma Ayers (Photo: Matthew Sobocinski)\n\nAmerica's young people have organized a massive gun control campaign, tried to block the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and have been a force in the #MeToo movement. That was just this year. But despite the growing activism among young voters, most of them are unlikely to turn out Tuesday.\n\nMillennials are poised to overtake baby boomers as the largest generation in the electorate within the next year. Generation X, millennials and Generation Z have the potential to be a force to reckon with \u2014 but only if they're able to overcome the foremost obstacle barring them from political relevance: apathy.\n\n\"Young people don\u2019t think that their vote matters or counts,\" says Alyssa Archie, a 21-year-old intern at the National Organization for Women.\n\nShe was one of the six young engaged voters I spoke to about what they see as barriers to a flourishing voter turnout among the youngest voter bloc.\n\nArchie is right. Sixty-six percent of young people are \"pessimistic\" about the worth of their vote. Layla Zaidane, a member of the Millennial Action Project, says it\u2019s a \"tragedy of the commons.\"\n\n\"Thinking of the impact of yourself as an individual, and not thinking about it in a sea of change, is what leads to these feelings of apathy or frustratedness,\" she says.\n\nRelated column: Let's vote, party and celebrate American democracy on a new holiday called Citizen Day\n\nMore: Early voting is making partisans more important than undecided voters\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nYoung voters have reason to question their vote's value. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump received nearly 3 million fewer votes than did Hillary Clinton, but through the workings of the Electoral College, he won the presidency. This is not insignificant to young people, who voted overwhelmingly for Clinton.\n\nFor elections in the middle of presidential terms, millennials trail baby boomers in turnout. When boomers were 25-29 years old, 36 percent of them showed up at midterms. Millennials lag behind them at a rate of 26 percent.\n\n\"It's about representation. It\u2019s hard for people our age to connect with your typical politician,\" suggests Madeleine Balestrier.\n\nBrad Polumbo, a member of advocacy group Young Voices, agreed that he doesn't feel that his U.S. senator, Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., reflects his values. \"She spends a lot of time on national issues, previewing her presidential election,\" he says.\n\nYoung voters recognize that their concerns and the concerns of their representatives don\u2019t necessarily align, but typically, their reaction to this realization is a nihilistic one. Why bother voting?\n\nA change is happening\n\nCandidates are getting younger and more diverse, and this could be the key to inspiring young voters. At 84, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, might not excite young voters, but a fresh face, like 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, might be enough to gather young support.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a New Yorker who is vying for a House seat, ran a Democratic primary campaign that targeted young people. Her platform includes stances on student loan debt and climate change, two issues that members of the panel noted as things that energize them.\n\nIf the recent political circus has caught the attention of young people and engaged them enough to vote, then a blue wave is more likley. Millennials are reliably Democratic, unlike older voters.\n\nThe 2017 special election in Alabama is an example of this. The contentious race for a vacant Senate seat was ultimately won by Democrat Doug Jones. Twenty-three percent of Alabama\u2019s young people voted in this election, and 60 percent of them voted for Jones.\n\nAlthough Democrats have the most to gain by exciting young voters, it seems they haven't done a sufficient job. Only a quarter of young voters say they\u2019re \"certain\" to vote in the midterm elections.\n\nMore novel approaches, such as throwing parties at polls, have also been shown to get people out to vote. Even Taylor Swift\u2019s uncharacteristic endorsement of Democratic candidatesinspired 65,000 people to register to vote in a single 24-hour period, although the challenge remains of having them show up on Election Day.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that young people have to be coaxed and courted to get them to the polls. Apathy is surely a privilege, but as young people are subjected to the harsher realities of the 21st century \u2014 insurmountable student debt, accumulating national debt, the threat of climate catastrophe \u2014 they might just be persuaded to pry themselves from Netflix long enough to vote.\n\nKimberly Habicht is a USA TODAY editorial page intern for the fall of 2018.

(Photo: Jack Gruber/USA TODAY Network)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anything more depressing than the media and Republicans in Congress arguing that the Brett Kavanaugh hearings \u2014 along with the demeaning treatment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 somehow constituted a political victory for the GOP. But these people have confused winning a single battle for the larger war. Despite the incredible pain provoked by Kavanaugh and his defenders, I have no doubt that opposing his nomination was a fight worth waging. In fact, history has already shown us the potential backlash that his appointment can spark against the GOP.\n\nBack in the fall of 1991, I was starting my senior year at UCLA. As a government major, I\u2019d always held an interest in politics. That October, Anita Hill\u2019s brave decision to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee had a profound effect upon me.\n\nTo this day, I can vividly remember Professor Hill\u2019s composure as she stated her allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas. I remember my anger at the disgraceful behavior Republican senators exhibited toward such a credible and sympathetic witness. At one point, Arlen Specter accused Hill of \"flat-out perjury,\" while Orrin Hatch suggested that she\u2019d lifted her claims from the book \"The Exorcist.\"\n\nAnita Hill gave women resolve. Ford will too.\n\nAfter the proceedings, I remember the insults hurled at Hill by scores of political pundits. Most of them were men, including then-conservative (now liberal) David Brock, who labeled her \u201ca little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.\u201d I also remember feeling a new and distinct sense of determination. During the Hill hearings, Newsweek ran an article covering the many female-led protests against Thomas. An accompanying photograph showed one angry woman holding a sign reading, \u201cWe Will Remember Next November.\u201d I clipped out that photo and pasted it onto the wall of my dorm.\n\nSoon after, I began volunteering for local campaigns, and after graduation I landed a job with the California Democratic Party. Throughout the summer and autumn of 1992, I worked alongside countless other young women who\u2019d also been spurred to action after witnessing how Hill had been treated before an entire nation.\n\nBy the time November came around, it appeared women all across America remembered as well. That campaign season is now known as \u201cThe Year of the Woman.\u201d At time of the Thomas hearings, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland was the lone female Democrat in the Senate. The 1992 elections brought in four more to join her, including Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein from California \u2014 making it the first state in American history to send an all-female delegation to the Senate. The House that year welcomed an additional 16 Democratic women.\n\nMore: Vote or forever hold your peace. This really IS the most important election of your life.\n\nKavanaugh will trigger historic Democratic turnout led by women in November election\n\nDemocrats have unleashed a red wave of Brett Kavanaugh-believing women voters\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 3, 1992, I celebrated California's election of both Feinstein and Boxer while also watching women\u2019s turnout increase nationwide. I can still recall seeing the results flash across the television screen that night. And I\u2019ve held onto the yellowed Newsweek article I once pinned up on my wall as a reminder of the excruciating weeks in October 1991 that gave birth to an entire career devoted to political activism and advocacy.\n\nTwenty-seven years later, the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh triggered the same harrowing emotions as the Anita Hill hearings. Fortunately, our culture has made some strides since then. In 1991, only 24 percent in a New York Times poll believed Hill\u2019s testimony, including just 26 percent of women. In 2018, on the other hand, more voters believed Ford than Kavanaugh \u2014 including 55 percent of American women.\n\nUltimately, however, Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court shows just how far we still have left to go. His confirmation does not signal the end of our society\u2019s fight to eliminate sexual assault and harassment. Instead, it merely marks the beginning of the next stage.\n\nA new year of the woman after Kavanaugh\n\nWhile some in the GOP base may indeed \u201ccome home\u201d and turn out as a result of the Kavanaugh fight, a recent USA Today poll indicates anti-Kavanaugh voters are the larger energized group. And I firmly believe that an overwhelming number of Americans galvanized by his confirmation will be people like me: People who will become deeply involved in politics for the first time \u2014 just like I did back in the fall of 1991.\n\nThese new activists won\u2019t stop at simply casting a ballot. They will do whatever else it takes, from volunteering for phone banks to knocking on doors and donating to candidates all across the country. And they will stay engaged well after these midterms.\n\nI\u2019m confident that this new wave of activists will enrich the Democratic Party for decades to come. And that they\u2019ll help ensure that Election Day 2018 goes down in history as another Year of the Woman.\n\nNeera Tanden is the CEO of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.

The Nittany Lions (6-2, 3-2, No. 14 CFP) are all but out of the East race, but they could still make a New Year's bowl if they win out.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nPurdue QB David Blough vs. Iowa defense\n\nBlough had been about the hottest thing going in the Big Ten before throwing three interceptions last week against Michigan State, his last one coming at the Spartans' 22 when the Boilermakers (4-4, 3-2) were down 16-13 with 10 minutes left in a 23-13 loss. Blough faces another big challenge against Iowa (6-2, 3-2, No. 16 CFP), which held Trace McSorley and Tommy Stevens to 13-of-29 passing for 194 yards in a loss at Penn State.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nNebraska and Ohio State have combined for 1,800 all-time victories. Ohio State is second all-time with 905 victories; Nebraska is fifth with 895 wins. ... Raheem Blackshear leads Rutgers with 90 rushing attempts and 27 receptions. The last time the same player led the Scarlet Knights in those two categories was Brian Leonard in 2003 (213 carries, 53 receptions). ... Wisconsin's Paul Chryst, with a win over Rutgers, would become the third coach in modern Big Ten history to win 40 games in his first four seasons at a school. The first two were Urban Meyer (50, 2012-15) and Jim Tressel (40, 2001-04), both of Ohio State. ... In the six quarters since he took over as the starter, Minnesota QB Tanner Morgan has completed 28 of 40 passes (70 percent) for 516 yards and three touchdowns and rushed six times for 33 yards and one TD. ... Illinois RB Reggie Corbin's 8.03 yards per carry ranks first in the Big Ten and second nationally. ... Michigan State would become the 27th FBS program to win 700 games if it beats Maryland. The Spartans are 699-456-44 all-time. ... The Maryland defense's 14 interceptions are tied for most in the country, with Fresno State and LSU. The Terrapins are the only Big Ten team with at least one interception in every game.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nNorthwestern, 9 \u00bd-point underdog at home to Notre Dame\n\nThe Wildcats (5-3) have had a charmed season, starting 1-3 before ascending to the top of the Big Ten West. This nonconference game against the third-ranked and unbeaten Irish (8-0, No. 4 CFP) is a chance for Northwestern to raise its profile and ding Notre Dame's playoff hopes. In their last meeting, in 2014, Northwestern erased an 11-point deficit late in the fourth quarter to beat the Irish 43-40 in overtime in South Bend.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nOhio State RBs J.K. Dobbins and Mike Weber Jr.\n\nThe Buckeyes' ground game has generated fewer than 100 yards in two straight games, a major red flag for an offense that needs Dobbins and Weber to complement precision passer Dwayne Haskins. Teams committed to the run can do damage against Nebraska, the Buckeyes' opponent this week, so this is an opportunity for Dobbins and Weber to get well.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But the Bucks played without Antetokounmpo, who missed the game because he was in concussion protocol.\n\nNot too long ago, a game without the do-everything Antetokounmpo might have spelled trouble for Milwaukee.\n\nNo problem against Toronto.\n\nThe Bucks tied a franchise record for the second time in three games by hitting 19 3s. They've won six straight by 10 or more points. They've scored at least 113 points in each win.\n\nAn open look at the 3-point line likely means a shot will go up.

But they also have the valuable experience of beating a quality opponent without Antetokounmpo.\n\n\"Sometimes you can get caught standing and watching Giannis,\" Budenholzer said. \"The more we can just keep moving, keep the ball moving and play together, including Giannis, it's a good lesson.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In last year's preseason Top 25, the only ranked team that wasn't coming off an NCAA Tournament berth was No. 25 Texas A&M.\n\nAll four of the ranked teams that missed out on NCAA Tournament invitations did play in the NIT. Mississippi State advanced as far as the NIT semifinals before losing to eventual champion Penn State .\n\n\"Just to know we made it that far in the NIT with everyone coming back, we know we should have a good run to make it to the NCAA Tournament this year,\" Mississippi State guard Quinndary Weatherspoon said.\n\nOregon reached the Final Four in 2017, and LSU last made the NCAA Tournament in 2015, but Mississippi State and Washington are trying to end longer droughts. Mississippi State hasn't earned a bid since 2009, and Washington is chasing its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011.\n\n\"Last year we were teaching them how to win,\" Washington coach Mike Hopkins said. \"This year, we're teaching them how to handle expectations. So it'll be a new learning curve, but the kids have worked really hard and playing well together.\"\n\nHere's a look at some teams that have realistic preseason hopes of reaching the NCAA Tournament after failing to get there last year.\n\nINDIANA\n\n2017-18 record: 16-15 (9-9 Big Ten)\n\nIndiana has one of the nation's most touted freshmen in guard Romeo Langford , who was rated as the No. 7 prospect in his class according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports . Langford headlines a five-man freshman class. Indiana returns senior forward Juwan Morgan, who earned second-team all-Big Ten honors and averaged 16.5 points and 7.4 rebounds last season. Other Hoosiers who made at least 12 starts last season include De'Ron Davis, Devonte Green and Zach McRoberts. Indiana adds Saint Mary's graduate transfer Evan Fitzner.\n\nNo. 23 LSU\n\n2017-18 record: 18-15 (8-10 Southeastern Conference, lost in second round of NIT)\n\nTremont Waters is back for his sophomore season after averaging 15.9 points and 6 assists last season. He is joined in the backcourt by Skylar Mays, who had 11.3 points per game last season. LSU added a signing class that was ranked fourth in the nation according to the 247Sports Composite . LSU's freshman class includes three top-35 national recruits in forwards Naz Reid and Emmitt Williams plus guard Ja'Vonte Smart.\n\nMARQUETTE\n\n2017-18 record: 21-14 (9-9 Big East), NIT quarterfinalist\n\nMarquette returns four starters from last year's team . That list includes Markus Howard, who scored 20.4 points per game last season and earned second-team all-Big East honors. Sam Hauser averaged 14.1 points and shot 48.7 percent from 3-point range last season. Marquette's other returning starters are Sacar Anim and Matt Heldt. The Golden Eagles also add Fordham graduate transfer Joseph Chartouny and Nebraska transfer Ed Morrow. Chartouny averaged 3.34 steals to lead all Division I players last season.\n\nNo. 18 MISSISSIPPI STATE\n\n2017-18 record: 25-12 (9-9 SEC), NIT semifinalist\n\nMississippi State returns its top six scorers from last season and is ranked for the first time since February 2012. The Bulldogs' list of returners includes senior guard Quinndary Weatherspoon, who averaged 14.4 points last season and was a second-team all-SEC pick by the leagues' coaches. Other notable returners include Aric Holman (10.9 ppg last year), Nick Weatherspoon (10.8), Lamar Peters (9.6), Tyson Carter (8.9) and Abdul Ado (7.8). The Bulldogs' freshman class is led by forward Reggie Perry.\n\nNo. 14 OREGON\n\n2017-18 record: 23-13 (10-8 Pac-12), lost in second round of NIT\n\nOregon is the Pac-12 media's pick to win the conference. Payton Pritchard returns after leading the Ducks in scoring (14.5) and assists (4.8) last season. Oregon also added the nation's No. 3 signing class according to the 247Sports Composite . The class is headlined by 7-foot-2 center Bol Bol, rated by the 247Sports Composite as the nation's No. 4 overall prospect in his class. Texas A&M-Corpus Christi graduate transfer Ehab Amin led all Division I players in steals (3.4) and averaged 16.9 points and 6.6 rebounds in 2016-17 before missing last season due to a hip injury.\n\nNo. 25 WASHINGTON\n\n2017-18 record: 21-13 (10-8 Pac-12), lost in second round of NIT\n\nWashington returns all five starters and its top seven scorers from last season. The Huskies have four players who had double-figure scoring averages last season: Jaylen Nowell (16.0), Noah Dickerson (15.5), David Crisp (11.6) and Matisse Thybulle (11.2). Dickerson also had a team-leading 8.4 rebounds per game last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSome things to know about Week 10 in the Big 12 Conference:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nNo. 12 West Virginia (6-1, 4-1 Big 12, No. 13 CFP) at No. 15 Texas (6-2, 4-1, No. 17). A November matchup that could go a long way in determining who plays in the Big 12 championship game \u2014 and could even be a preview of the Dec. 1 game. The Mountaineers and Longhorns, who last met as ranked teams in their initial game as Big 12 foes in 2012, are tied with No. 7 Oklahoma atop the league standings. Texas is 3-0 this season against Top 25 teams, but coach Tom Herman's team is looking to bounce back from a loss at Oklahoma State that ended its six-game winning streak. West Virginia and quarterback Will Grier rebounded from a loss at Iowa State with a lopsided home win over Baylor last week. WVU ends its regular season against Oklahoma, which the Longhorns already beat at the State Fair of Texas.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nOklahoma interim defensive coordinator Ruffin McNeill against Texas Tech and coach Kliff Kingsbury's offense. The Red Raiders average 528 total yards and 42 points a game, second only to Oklahoma in the Big 12. Since McNeill replaced fired defensive coordinator Mike Stoops, the Sooners have held TCU to 275 total yards and Kansas State to 245. McNeill was defensive coordinator at Texas Tech before going to East Carolina as head coach. Sooners coach Lincoln Riley, a Texas Tech alumnus who started his coaching career there, was on McNeill's staff at ECU. Kingsbury was a record-setting quarterback at Tech when McNeill was on the staff there.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nTexas Tech leads the Big 12 with 23 rushing touchdowns, and has allowed only nine. ... Iowa State has won its last three games, all in October to improve to 7-0 in such games the past two seasons. The only other time they went undefeated in October was 1938. ... Oklahoma State and Texas Tech both need one win to get bowl eligible. Only Big 12 co-leaders Oklahoma, West Virginia and Texas already have six wins. ... Baylor WR Jalen Hurd, the former Tennessee RB, has 39 first-down receptions and 35 catches for at least 10 yards.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nTCU has never had a four-game losing streak in coach Gary Patterson's 18 seasons as head coach. The Horned Frogs (3-5) go into Saturday's home game against Kansas State, the coach's alma mater, with three losses in a row. But they are favored by more than a touchdown against K-State, which has lost four of its last five games, including 51-14 at Oklahoma last weekend.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nKansas freshman running back Pooka Williams is the Big 12 leader with 147.7 all-purpose yards per game. When held to 33 yards rushing on 11 carries against TCU, he had seven catches for 102 yards and two touchdowns as the Jayhawks won. Williams is still fourth in the Big 12 with 93.3 yards rushing per game.\n\n___\n\nCompiled by AP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Timberwolves won 128-125. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDuring the 2017-18 regular season, Derrick Rose didn't score 50 points in all of January.\n\nOr February.\n\nOr March.\n\nOr April.\n\nHe was hurting, always in and out of the lineup, never in rhythm. Those problems, all his years of problems, seemed so long ago Wednesday night, when Rose was better than ever \u2014 finishing with a career-high 50 points that lifted the Minnesota Timberwolves over the Utah Jazz 128-125.\n\n\"I played my heart out,\" Rose said. \"My teammates told me before the game, just play my game. And tonight was a hell of a night.\"\n\nThat it was, by every possible measure.\n\nRose became the fourth player already this season \u2014 it's barely two weeks old \u2014 to score at least 50 in a game, joining Blake Griffin, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.\n\nAnd if the 50 wasn't enough, Rose sealed the win by blocking Dante Exum's 3-pointer with about two seconds remaining.\n\nMoments later, Rose walked off the floor in tears. The game had made the 2011 NBA MVP cry before. Only this time, the emotion was all joy.\n\n\"I know the person that he is, the character that he has,\" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"And it shines through.\"\n\nRose has dealt with four knee surgeries, took time away last season to figure things out while dealing with ankle issues and sat out nearly two full seasons when he should have been in his prime.\n\nA night like this showed what is still possible.\n\n\"In every story, there's a beginning, a middle and an end,\" Thibodeau said. \"And I think the end is going to be great for him.\"\n\nRose tried to play it cool afterward, then acknowledged that he was still \"jittery as hell\" \u2014 and that was about an hour after the game.\n\n\"It means everything,\" Rose said.\n\nThe Wolves mobbed Rose on the floor when it was over. They doused him with water in the locker room. And around the league, players couldn't wait to show him love.\n\n\"What he gives to his mind and body just to play one game is something I watched being his teammate,\" said LeBron James, who played with Rose in Cleveland last season. \"When you talk about perseverance, that is the true definition of it. ... Even when a superhero is knocked down, he is still a superhero at the end of the day. And Derrick showed why he is a superhero.\"\n\n\"Every Basketball fan in the world should feel good for DRose,\" wrote Miami guard Dwyane Wade, also Rose's teammate in Cleveland. \"Tonite was an example of never giving up on yourself and when others believe in you. Amazing things can happen. I'm smiling like i scored 50! Congrts to a good dude!\"\n\nHouston star Chris Paul weighed in, as did Bulls great Scottie Pippen.\n\n\"Hard work is undefeated,\" wrote Portland's CJ McCollum.\n\nAn offensive outburst like this seemed, at best, improbable for Rose, considering he hadn't even topped 35 points in any game since that MVP season.\n\nThibodeau coached Rose in Chicago, and has seen him at his best and his worst. He knows the adversity, the struggle, everything Rose has gone through for the better part of the last decade.\n\n\"The only thing that really matters to him is that you win,\" Thibodeau said.\n\nIt's been a rocky season already for the Wolves, who have been dealing with the Jimmy Butler saga since before camp \u2014 Butler didn't play Wednesday, with the team calling it a break for needed rest. Butler requested a trade prior to the season but remains on the roster.\n\nNone of that seemed to be on anybody's mind when the final horn sounded against the Jazz. Rose was all that mattered.\n\nAnd a night like this, he said, was worth the wait.\n\n\"It's all just coming together,\" Rose said. \"But it took six, seven years.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It's not one or two or three guys that can score every night.\"\n\nIt was the first two-goal game of Virtanen's career. At one point in the third period, it appeared he might have a chance at a hat trick, but the 22-year-old right wing chose not to push it.\n\n\"I didn't want to go out of position or anything,\" he said. \"I wanted to make sure we weren't getting scored on. ... We'd rather just secure the win and call it a day.\"\n\nJacob Markstrom made 24 saves for Vancouver.\n\nBrandon Saad and Jonathan Toews scored for the Blackhawks. Corey Crawford turned away 24 shots, but coach Joel Quenneville thought turnovers were a big problem.\n\n\"I think it was self-inflicted on the goals against,\" he said. \"Preventable, all of them, and they turned turnovers into the back of the net.\"\n\nThe team got sloppy with the puck, according to Saad.\n\n\"A couple posts and unlucky bounces, but regardless we have to tighten up defensively,\" he said. \"We give that team that much rush chances and time and space and they are going to capitalize. It definitely wasn't good enough defensively.\"\n\nGaunce scored at 9:23 of the third after he snatched up a Chicago pass. The goal was the sixth of his NHL career, with the last one coming on Feb. 1.\n\n\"I just tried to get it off as quick as I could,\" he said. \"I knew (Crawford) was coming out and he was a little bit off because it was such a quick play and I just tried to get it up.\"\n\nGaunce also assisted on Roussel's late goal in his first game with the Canucks this season. He was called up Tuesday from the Utica Comets of the AHL to help fill out a roster riddled by injuries.\n\nThe 24-year-old said he was playing with a bit of a chip on his shoulder.\n\n\"I want to be in the NHL, and at the start of the year. I obviously wasn't, so there was a reason for that,\" Gaunce said. \"You come in here with the mentality that you're going to make a difference and you're going to kind of make them have to keep you.\"\n\nChicago got on the scoreboard first with Saad scoring his third of the season midway through the first period. The left wing beat Canucks defenseman Erik Gudbranson in Vancouver's end and put a hard shot on net. Markstrom appeared to get a piece of it but the puck trickled in underneath him.\n\nVirtanen responded in the 15th minute after the Blackhawks turned over the puck in the neutral zone. He picked up speed on a breakaway and put a high shot past Crawford.\n\nThe Blackhawks went back on top with a power-play goal early in the second after Canucks defenseman Michael Del Zotto took a cross-checking penalty late in the first.\n\nToews fired in a wrister from the top of the faceoff circle to give him 299 goals for the Blackhawks, sixth-most in franchise history.\n\nChicago is 30th in the NHL on the power play. Wednesday marked the sixth time this season the Blackhawks have scored with the man advantage.\n\nVirtanen followed with his second of the night just more than 12 minutes into the second period. He scooped up a pass just inside the blue line and fired a quick shot past Crawford to tie it 2-all. Virtanen has five goals and two assists this season.\n\nNOTES: Blackhawks star Patrick Kane sat out due to illness, the first time he's been out of the lineup since breaking his collarbone in February 2015. ...

(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 DeMar DeRozan and coach Gregg Popovich had a talk before Wednesday night's game about DeRozan's playing time this season.\n\nThe hope was DeRozan could get a bit more rest. It worked out just right for DeRozan, Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs in their 120-90 win over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nDeRozan scored 20 of his 25 points in the first half, LaMarcus Aldridge added 24 points and the Spurs routed the Suns for their third straight victory. DeRozan and Aldridge, Nos. 1 and 2 in the NBA in minutes per game going in, sat out the entire fourth quarter with the Spurs comfortably ahead.\n\n\"That was big,\" said DeRozan, who was averaging 38.9 minutes per game. \"That was one thing that was on my mind today. To go out there and do what we're supposed to do so we'd be able to rest.\"\n\nThe Spurs led by 31 during the second quarter en route to a fifth straight win over Phoenix. Aldridge scored 16 points in the third. He and DeRozan combined to make 20 of 25 shots.\n\n\"It's always nice to get some rest,\" Aldridge said. \"I thought guys came in focused from the beginning. It's always nice when your shots go in. DeMar started out hot and I got it going in the third, and that always makes it easy for us.\"\n\nThe Suns have lost six straight and joined the Cleveland Cavaliers and Washington Wizards at 1-6, tied for the NBA's worst. T.J. Warren, in his first start of the season, led Phoenix with 21 points. Suns rookie Mikal Bridges added a career-best 16 points.\n\n\"The final score is basically saying a lot where we're at as a team,\" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said.\n\nThe Spurs closed out the first quarter on a 15-2 run after the game was tied at 13. San Antonio went up 40-22 on DeRozan's fastbreak dunk with 7:34 left in the first half.\n\nDeRozan made 8 of 10 shots in the first half, many on drives to the basket.\n\nThe Spurs made 24 of 41 shots in the first half and turned the game into a blowout with the Suns struggling on the offensive end. San Antonio stayed hot, making 55.4 percent of its shots.\n\nMarco Belinelli's fadeaway 3-pointer with 2:12 left in the first half made the score 60-29. The Spurs led by 32 points during the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Suns scored the final 10 points of the first half to trail by 21 at the break.\n\n\"We're going to come back and we're going to learn and watch some film and get better,\" Bridges said. \"Just playing as a team, going out there and just fighting.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSpurs: San Antonio will be back in Phoenix in two weeks for the second meeting of the season between the two teams. ... DeRozan has led the Spurs in scoring in six of their seven games. ... F Rudy Gay came up hobbling after missing a layup late in the third quarter, but shook it off and remained in the game.\n\nSuns: Phoenix played its third straight game without star guard Devin Booker, who is still dealing with a hamstring strain. ... G Isaiah Canaan (left ankle strain) was held out. ... G Josh Jackson played despite a bruised left toe. ... The Suns are 8-10 on Halloween.\n\nEXCUSE ME\n\nAldridge inadvertently tipped up a pass from DeRozan, and the ball dropped into the net for two points with 8:56 left in the third quarter. The two shared a smile as they headed back on defense.\n\nYOUNG SUNS RUNNING POINT\n\nWith Canaan out, the Suns began the game with rookie Elie Okobo at point guard making his first career start. Backing him up was another rookie, De'Anthony Melton, who had been inactive for the past three games. Melton played a season high 20 minutes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSpurs: Host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.\n\nSuns: Host the Toronto Raptors on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

With that, Singapore reclaimed the title for having the world\u2019s longest regularly scheduled flight. The carrier generated headlines around the world as it bumped out the prior record-holder, Qatar Airways and its 9,032-mile flight between Doha, Qatar, and Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nFriday, Singapore Airlines will restart another U.S. route that also will be among the longest on the planet. The airline\u2019s Los Angeles-Singapore flights will cover 8,770 miles, ranking as the fifth-longest in the world as measured by distance. Flight time for the Singapore-bound leg is scheduled for 17 hours, 50 minutes.\n\nSingapore Airlines is on the move in Northern California, too. It\u2019s already expanding its recently-launched San Francisco-Singapore service, going to 10 flights a week from the current seven.\n\nLee called the moves \u201ca huge expansion of our U.S. network.\u201d\n\nOnce Singapore\u2019s four-times-a-week Seattle service begins Sept. 3, the airline will have a total of 57 flights a week from the U.S., according to Lee. The growth represents a 43 percent increase in flight frequency compared to the carrier\u2019s September 2018 schedule.\n\nSingapore is perhaps best known around the world for its Airbus A380 super jumbo jets that feature ultraluxurious suites. But it\u2019s a different plane that\u2019s been the key for Singapore\u2019s recent growth spurt in the U.S.\n\nARCHIVES: Swivel chairs, double beds, 32\" TVs: Check out Singapore Air's swanky new 'suites' on its Airbus A380s (story continues below)\n\nThat\u2019s the Airbus A350 and an \u201cultra long-range\u201d variant of the jet that was designed by Airbus at the request of Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe twin-engine A350, which first began flying for airlines in 2015, was already capable of flying long intercontinental flights. But the \u201cULR\u201d version has an even greater range. Airbus says the ULR is capable of flying about 11,100 statute miles while carrying a normal load of passengers and cargo. The typical range of a standard A350-900 is about 9,300 statute miles, according to specifications from Airbus.\n\nSingapore Airlines, which took delivery of its first A350 in 2016, has a total of 60 A350-900s on order and another seven of the ULR variant. Four of the A350-900ULRs and 21 of the A350-900s have already been delivered to the carrier.\n\nFor Singapore, the ULR has allowed the resumption of nonstops from Singapore to Newark and Los Angeles \u2013 routes the carrier discontinued in 2013 as it phased out its gas-guzzling, four-engine Airbus A340s amid rising fuel prices.\n\n\u201cWhat really has changed is that with the introduction of the A350, the ultra long-range variant of this aircraft, we are able to re-launch these two routes again,\u201d Lee said.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: The world's new No. 1 airline for 2018 is ... (story continues below)\n\n\u201cWe now have an efficient means of flying from Singapore to the United States. It is a very important market for us,\u201d he added \u201cWe are very committed to this market, and we intend to grow our footprint and continue to serve our customers here with the best product and service possible.\u201d\n\nBut Singapore won\u2019t need the ULR version for Seattle, where the carrier will use its standard A350-900s for the 8,070-mile, 16-hour, 30-minute run to Singapore.\n\nWhile that service will likely rank as one of the world\u2019s 30 longest regularly scheduled flights once it begins, \u201cthe regular A350-900 will be able to fulfill this mission,\u201d Lee said.\n\nFor now, Lee declined to say if Singapore might expand its roster of U.S. destinations beyond Seattle, though he didn\u2019t dismiss the possibility.\n\n\u201cIt depends on how the traffic builds up and how the economic conditions are,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut, really, we don\u2019t believe Seattle is the last destination that we will add in the U.S. We are always looking out for more opportunities.\u201d\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Now flying from NYC: The world's longest flight (story continues below)\n\nSingapore Airlines' U.S. routes\n\nNewark\n\nNonstop to Singapore (Service on Airbus 350-ULR jets)\n\nNew York JFK\n\nNonstop to Frankfurt (Airbus A380 jets)\n\nHouston Bush Intercontinental\n\nNonstop to Manchester, England (Airbus A350-900 jets)\n\nLos Angeles\n\nNonstop to Singapore (Begins Nov. 2; Airbus A350-ULR jets)\n\nNonstop to Seoul Incheon (Boeing 777-300ER jets)\n\nSan Francisco\n\nNonstop to Singapore (mix of Airbus A350-900 and A350-900ULR jets)\n\nNonstop to Hong Kong (Boeing B777-300ER jets)\n\nSeattle\n\nNonstop to Singapore (begins Sept. 3, 2019; Airbus A350-900 jets)\n\nSource: Singapore Airlines\n\nSingapore Airlines' longest U.S. routes\n\nNewark-Singapore: 9,534 miles\n\nLos Angeles-Singapore: 8,770 miles (begins Nov. 2)\n\nSan Francisco-Singapore: 8,446 miles\n\nSeattle-Singapore: 8,070 miles (begins Sept. 3)\n\nSource: Great Circle Mapper (gcmap.com)\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Have 19 hours?

Swedish visitors are surprised to find salty licorice, popular at home but perceived as disgusting to many.\n\nAmerican foods on display include Jell-O salad (the one on display has olives in it, which even some Americans will disavow); canned pork brains with milk gravy; and root beer, which Swedes say tastes like toothpaste.\n\nWest, who originally is from California, said he has managed only to sample about half of the more exotic collected consumables.

His previous career high was 44 for the Chicago Bulls in a second-round playoff game against the Atlanta Hawks on May 6, 2011.\n\n\"It still didn't even hit me yet,\" Rose said. \"Words can't explain how I feel right now. It's been a while.\"\n\nPlaying without leading scorer Jimmy Butler, who sat out for rest, Rose was clutch late for the T'wolves. He scored 34 points in the second half, including 15 in a tight fourth quarter and six of Minnesota's final seven.\n\n\"He's been through a lot of adversity. He's maybe one of the most mentally tough people I've ever come across,\" said T'wolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who coached Rose in Chicago during his prime seasons.\n\nHis up-and-under lay-up put the T'wolves ahead 123-122 with 54.6 seconds left. After the Jazz's Rudy Gobert made 1-of-2 free throws to tie it, Rose made it 125-123 with a short jumper. Karl-Anthony Towns made a free throw for Minnesota and Dante Exum a dunk for Utah. Rose then hit 50 on a pair of free throws with 13.8 seconds left.\n\nUtah had three chances on its final possession to tie. The Jazz got the offensive rebound after two missed 3-pointers.

The Nuggets won 108-107. (AP Photo/David Banks) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Paul Millsap knows nobody is perfect in the NBA. The key to being a good team is finding ways to win when not everything is clicking.\n\nThe 13-year veteran believes that's exactly what the Denver Nuggets did Wednesday night.\n\nNikola Jokic had 22 points and 12 rebounds, and Millsap's putback with 0.1 seconds left in overtime gave the Nuggets a 108-107 victory against the Chicago Bulls.\n\nTrailing by a point, Denver inbounded the ball with 3.5 seconds remaining. Jokic missed, but Millsap grabbed the rebound and converted a layup off the glass for the winning basket as the Nuggets improved to 6-1.\n\n\"All games are not going to be pretty,\" Millsap said. \"You're not going to shoot the lights out all the time, but the way that we're winning games is something special, especially with young guys.\n\n\"They're learning how to win without making shots.\"\n\nZach LaVine had 28 points and rookie Wendell Carter Jr. scored a career-high 25 for Chicago.\n\nLaVine has at least 20 points in a career-best nine straight games, a streak that dates back to last season. It was Carter's second consecutive game establishing a new high. He had 18 points Monday against the Golden State Warriors.\n\n\"We have to learn how to win,\" LaVine said. \"We brought it all the way down to the wire, but we fought. It was a bounce back. Still (stinks), though. You play such a good game, you want that result.\"\n\nAfter the Nuggets took a 106-104 lead on a 3-pointer by Jokic \u2014 he had eight of Denver's 10 points in overtime \u2014 Justin Holiday answered with a 3 to put Chicago on top 107-106 with 1:26 to play.\n\nAfter giving up 92 first-half points to Golden State on Monday, the Bulls allowed just 51 in the first two quarters but still trailed by three at halftime.\n\nChicago held a 96-90 edge with three minutes left before Denver went on an 8-2 spurt to tie it at 98 with 1:07 left.\n\n\"I reminded our guys about the opening night in LA,\" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \"We were down six or eight and we never panicked. I said, 'Tonight, we're not going to panic, either.'\"\n\nNeither team could convert multiple opportunities in the final minute, sending the game to overtime.\n\nKEEP SHOOTING\n\nJokic had nine assists to finish one shy of a triple-double, but was having an off shooting night until the final minutes of regulation and overtime. He made his first three shots in OT \u2014 including a pair of 3-pointers \u2014 before the miss Millsap converted.\n\n\"It was unbelievable to see him flip the switch like that, to go from struggling to knocking down 3s in big moments,\" Millsap said. \"He's a special player.\"\n\nREUNION\n\nDenver G Monte Morris played two years under Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg at Iowa State. When Hoiberg made the jump to Chicago in 2016, Morris recalled his former coach told him he'd see him in the NBA. Morris, selected by the Nuggets in the second round (51st overall) of the 2017 draft, was far from a can't-miss prospect.\n\n\"You knew he was going to find a way to make it in this league,\" Hoiberg said. \"He's one of the smartest players, highest IQs, I've ever been around.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNuggets: The team announced Tuesday it picked up next season's option on the rookie-scale contracts of 2016 first-round draft picks Jamal Murray, Juan Hernangomez and Malik Beasley.\n\nBulls: F Lauri Markkanen (sprained right elbow) continues to progress in his rehab and this week added running on the track and upper-body weight training to his routine. \"He's still two to four weeks out,\" Hoiberg said. .

It's been a while.\"\n\nDerailed by injuries for years, Rose walked off serenaded by chants of \"MVP! MVP!\" from the home crowd. The 30-year-old point guard shot 19 of 31 from the field and hit four 3-pointers. He played 41 minutes, his most in nearly two years.\n\n\"He has courage, he has humility and he has character,\" said Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who also coached Rose during his prime seasons in Chicago. \"He's been through a lot of adversity.

His regular-season best had been 42 points.\n\nRose tied it at 110 with one of his patented layups, giving him 41 points. He weaved through traffic and made the off-balance shot, showing glimpses of the moves that once made him an elite player and the top pick in the 2008 draft.\n\n\"He was feeling great and when you start feeling great you get some extra energy, you get some extra adrenaline and you make amazing plays and that's what he did the whole game,\" Utah center Rudy Gobert said.\n\nMaking his first start of the season, Rose scored 19 points in the third quarter as the Timberwolves took a five-point lead into the fourth.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After walking into Madison Square Garden dressed as a superhero, Victor Oladipo had to shake off his lingering bronchitis before unleashing his powers on the New York Knicks.\n\nDomantas Sabonis was 12-for-12 shooting while matching his career high with 30 points, Oladipo scored 11 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter and the Indiana Pacers beat the Knicks 107-101 on Wednesday night.\n\nOladipo, who arrived in a Black Panther costume for Halloween, has been dealing with bronchitis for about a week, and it worsened two days ago. He started off cold Wednesday, scoring five points and picking up three fouls in the first half while feeling short of breath at times.\n\nIt was all different down the stretch.\n\nIndiana trailed 97-94 with 3:08 left before Oladipo got hot. Sabonis hit two free throws, and then Oladipo picked off Tim Hardaway Jr.'s lazy dribble and threw down a breakaway dunk for a 98-97 lead.\n\nIndiana scored the next five points, capped by Oladipo's 3-pointer with 1:23 left, to make it 103-97 after the star guard had hit just one of his previous seven 3s.\n\n\"Some of the shots I feel like I normally make I wasn't making today,\" Oladipo said. \"So got to find other ways to win, got other ways to impact the game.\"\n\nHardaway led the Knicks with 37 points, and Noah Vonleh had 14 points and 10 rebounds.

We're trying to be a good team and trying the change the tide of the Nets' teams in the past. You got to know how to get out of rut fast,\" Dinwiddie said after making a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left in overtime to help the Brooklyn Nets beat the Detroit Pistons 120-119.\n\n\"(Losses) can string together and it can affect morale and all that other stuff,\" Dinwiddie said.\n\nDinwiddie finished with a season-high 25 points. He was 8 of 15 from the field, including 5 for 9 from 3.

In the loss to their crosstown rivals, the Nets were out rebounded 53-32. And Atkinson focused on his guards, who combined for eight rebounds. \"A lot of times our bigs are locked in or boxing out a big, and our guards are not pursuing the ball like they should.\" Against the Pistons, Nets guards had 18 rebounds.\n\nMIDDLE OF THE ROAD\n\nHistorically, defense and the Detroit Pistons have been synonymous terms.

That forced the Brazilian side to win by three goals to qualify.\n\nPalmeiras leveled after halftime through Luan, and raised hopes when Gustavo Gomes converted a penalty eight minutes later.\n\nBut 10 minutes later, Dario Benedetto came off the bench again and scored again to snuff out Palmeiras' comeback. The striker scored both Boca goals at La Bombonera in the first leg.\n\nPalmeiras coach Luiz Felipe Scolari complimented Boca: \"I liked Boca's teamwork very much.\"\n\nPalmeiras' loss is ironic.

(AP Photo/Mark LoMoglio, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams' top defenders reacted with predictable glee when they heard about the addition of pass-rusher Dante Fowler through a trade with Jacksonville.\n\n\"I found out about it, and I was smiling ear to ear,\" defensive tackle Aaron Donald said Wednesday.\n\nThe unbeaten Rams' next opponents \u2014 the New Orleans Saints \u2014 also reacted as you might expect to LA's big addition ahead of their NFC showdown at the Superdome.\n\n\"They couldn't have waited a week?\" quarterback Drew Brees asked lightheartedly. \"He obviously adds some juice to that D-line that's already really stout.\"\n\nFowler passed his physical and went through the Rams' typically light Wednesday workout at their training complex. In between cram sessions on the Rams' defensive setup, he spent part of the afternoon in the locker room just talking with his new teammates.\n\n\"It's a new chapter, that's how I look at it,\" Fowler said. \"It's a fresh start, just being able to start over and show guys who I really am.\"\n\nFowler will play for the Rams as a linebacker, which he considers his \"natural position.\" He is hoping to be more of an every-down contributor than he was in Jacksonville, and he is eager to see what he can do on the rush when defenses must account for Donald, Ndamukong Suh and him on the same passing plays.\n\n\"(I want) to go in there, being the extra piece and just contributing to this great defense and to be a part of this special season,\" Fowler said. \"I'm ready to come in here and do what I've got to do to get us where we want to go. ... (Donald is the) best defensive tackle in the league, and Ndamukong Suh is a dominant defensive tackle. Shouldn't be no reason, when I do have my one-on-ones, I've just got to make the most out of them.\"\n\nThe Rams want to go to the Super Bowl, and they're expected to be a strong contender after the franchise's first 8-0 start since 1969.\n\nFowler has a major advantage in playoff experience over most of his new teammates: The Jaguars reached the AFC championship game last season, winning two playoff games along the way before losing to New England. The Rams made the playoffs last season for the first time since the 2004 seasons, and they lost their only postseason game to Atlanta.\n\n\"I was on a really good team last year,\" said Fowler, who had two sacks in the conference title game. \"So it's giving me a little drive, making me really excited, because I already know the way (to prepare) to be a championship team, and I'm ready for it.\"\n\nFowler already has one friend on the Rams' defense: Dominique Easley, LA's injured veteran lineman and linebacker, was Fowler's host at the University of Florida when he was choosing a college. Fowler called him \"my big brother.\"\n\nCoach Sean McVay isn't sure how much Fowler will play against the Saints (6-1), but the former first-round pick's arrival added another dimension to an already solid defense.\n\n\"We anticipate him being able to be involved, and we'll see how he's able to adjust, how he's able to absorb that information,\" McVay said. \"We wanted to get him in here, and (we're) hopeful that he's a contributor for us as soon as this weekend against a tough team.\"\n\nNOTES\n\nMcVay still anticipates the return of WR Cooper Kupp from a two-game absence with a knee injury. Kupp was limited in practice Wednesday, but the Rams typically don't do much physical work on Wednesdays. ... LB Trevon Young was the only other Rams player on the injury report. He was limited with his back injury. ... The Rams intend to lean on center Brian Allen and rookie Joseph Noteboom as their backup offensive linemen after the loss of Jamon Brown, who was released to make room for Fowler. \"What a class act,\" McVay said of Brown. \"Couldn't have been more impressed with just the way that he handled a tough, difficult discussion. There's always the human element that I don't think you'll ever be OK with. That's what's tough for us, for me as a coach, is when you've got to look somebody in the eye who's been nothing but a class act, a great teammate, instrumental in being able to win a division last year.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Oct. 31) AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)\n\nPresident Donald Trump began a late-campaign tour of eight states on Wednesday by stoking Florida Republicans over immigration, an emotional issue that stirs voters of both parties.\n\n\"We\u2019re getting prepared for the caravan, folks, you don\u2019t have to worry about that,\" Trump told supporters at a rally near Fort Myers, Florida, adding that \"a vote for Democrats is a vote to liquidate America\u2019s borders.\"\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, said Trump's targeting of migrants will push their voters to the polls, helping their party win control of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.\n\nFor days, Trump has blasted a \"caravan\" of migrants from Central America that is hundreds of miles from the U.S. border; threatened to send up to 15,000 troops to guard that border; and talked about an executive order to stop birthright citizenship, despite legal scholars who say he can't.\n\nClaiming it costs the United States \"billions of dollars,\" Trump denounced birthright citizenship as a \"crazy policy.\" It is, however, a constitutional right, and legal scholars say the 14th Amendment is clear in conferring citizenship on any person born in the United States, even if their parents are undocumented.\n\nImmigration is important to Trump's base of most ardent supporters, political analysts said, and is likely to juice Republican turnout for the Nov. 6 elections. It may also motivate Democratic voters, including fast-growing Hispanic communities in closely contested congressional districts.\n\n\"It might help in the short-term in red (Republican) states, but I think it damages Republicans in swing areas and among younger voters,\" said William Kristol, editor-at-large of The Weekly Standard magazine and a conservative critic of Trump.\n\nDemocratic strategist Lis Smith called Trump's approach \"a base-only strategy that threatens to backfire on Republicans in this election and beyond. The GOP is already having problems with suburban voters, young voters, college-educated voters, and Latino voters \u2013 all of whom reject anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies.\"\n\nBen Ray, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Republicans are flailing on the immigration issue, while \"Democrats have focused on the number one issue for voters, health care.\"\n\nTrump and aides say their are confident that voters agree with them on illegal immigration. Trump told the crowd in Florida that Democratic lawmakers \"won't give us any votes on border security.\"\n\nTo be sure, Trump struck other notes during the hour-long rally.\n\nStressing the economy, Trump touted tax cuts and reduced government regulations. He cited increased military spending and canceling the Iran nuclear deal. The president also bashed the \"far left media\" for efforts to \"sow anger and division\" among politically divided Americans.\n\nIn visiting Florida, Trump promoted the campaigns of Republican candidates Rick Scott, the governor now running for the U.S. Senate, and Ron DeSantis, who is seeking to replace Scott as governor.\n\nTrump is likely to continue harping on the immigration issue leading to Election Day on Tuesday.

Baer said.\n\nMcCovey was an instant hit when he reached the majors as a 21-year-old in 1959 with the Giants, winning the NL rookie of the year award unanimously, despite playing in just 52 games.\n\nIn 1962, he and Hall of Fame teammate Willie Mays led the Giants to the World Series against the New York Yankees. However, the Yankees won in seven games, with McCovey lining out to second base for the final out of the series.\n\nHe came back the following year and led the league in home runs with 44. That season would be the first of his six seasons as a member of the NL All-Star team.\n\nHowever, his greatest season came six years later when he won his third home run title with a career-high 45, led the league with 126 RBI and won MVP honors.\n\nMcCovey was 42 when he retired in the middle of the 1980 season, capping a career in which he hit .270. His 521 career home runs tied him for eighth all-time with Ted Williams at the time and ranked first among National League left-handed hitters.\n\nHis 18 grand slams remain an NL record.\n\nMcCovey was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. Even after his retirement, he remained involved with the Giants as one of the franchise's great ambassadors.\n\nHis popularity also contributed to legal problems when in 1995, he and former Brooklyn Dodgers outfielder Duke Snider were convicted of tax fraud for failing to report income from autograph signings and memorabilia shows.\n\nMcCovey was fined and sentenced to two years probation. However, he was pardoned in January 2017 by President Barack Obama during Obama's final days in office.\n\nWhen the Giants moved to a new ballpark in the China Basin area in 2000, the body of water beyond the right field wall was renamed McCovey Cove in his honor.\n\nThe Giants retired McCovey's number 44 and had a statue of him built at China Basin Park, on the other side of the cove, in 2003.\n\nThe team created an award in his honor, the Willie Mac Award, that was given annually to the Giants' most inspirational player, which McCovey presented every year at the beginning of the team's final homestand of the season.\n\nHe was on hand at the final series this season to present the 2018 Willie Mac Award to reliever Will Smith.\n\nUpon word of his death Wednesday afternoon, the flags at AT&T Park were lowered to half-staff in McCovey's memory.\n\nFollow Steve Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner.", "CLOSE DJ Durkin was fired by the University of Maryland just one day after the school's board of regents announced his reinstatement.

Durkin is gone, fired just 24 hours after the school\u2019s board of regents announced it was reinstating him following the conclusion of an investigation into the June 13 death of McNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman who collapsed and experienced seizures due to heatstroke at a May 29 team workout.\n\nOn Tuesday, after a grueling few months of scathing media reports and university investigations, board chairman James Brady announced the shocking decision to keep Durkin, a mediocre third-year coach with a 10-15 record, saying, \u201cWe believe he is a good man and a good coach who is devoted to athletes in his charge,\u201d adding that Durkin had been \u201cunfairly blamed for the dysfunction in the athletic department.\u201d\n\nThe criticism of that decision was instantaneous, overwhelming and unrelenting, so, on Wednesday, Maryland president Wallace Loh fired Durkin, action he had wanted to take days earlier, but had been prevented from doing by the board.\n\nWhat that means is that Brady and the entire board should be the next to go. They should take athletic director Damon Evans with them.

Did it ever worry about McNair in any of this?\n\nWhere the board failed, others succeeded. Compassionate and intelligent voices led the university to do what it had to do. Prior to news of Durkin\u2019s dismissal, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued a statement Wednesday evening calling on the board to reconsider its decision and schedule a public hearing, saying he was \u201cdeeply concerned about how they could have possibly arrived at the decisions announced yesterday.\u201d\n\nBen Jealous, the Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland, called the situation \u201ca national embarrassment,\u201d while Rep.

And yet he's returning and the president is the one that's leaving? When the system fails, the next obvious step is a grassroots push, being vocal and showing the outrage and sentiments students have had with these decisions.\"\n\nThese were the voices that led Maryland's so-called leaders to finally make the right decision.

He was 80.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants announced McCovey's death, saying the fearsome hitter passed \"peacefully\" on Wednesday afternoon \"after losing his battle with ongoing health issues.\"\n\nA first baseman and left fielder, McCovey was a .270 career hitter with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs in 22 major league seasons, 19 of them with the Giants. He also played for the Athletics and Padres.\n\nMcCovey made his major league debut at 21 on July 30, 1959, and played alongside the other Willie \u2014 Hall of Famer Willie Mays \u2014 into the 1972 season before Mays was traded to the New York Mets.\n\nMcCovey batted .354 with 13 homers and 38 RBIs on the way to winning the 1959 NL Rookie of the Year award. The six-time All-Star also won the 1969 NL MVP and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986 after his first time on the ballot.\n\n\"You knew right away he wasn't an ordinary ballplayer,\" Hall of Famer Hank Aaron said, courtesy of the Hall of Fame. \"He was so strong, and he had the gift of knowing the strike zone. There's no telling how many home runs he would have hit if those knees weren't bothering him all the time and if he played in a park other than Candlestick.\"\n\nMcCovey had been getting around in a wheelchair in recent years because he could no longer rely on his once-dependable legs, yet was still regularly seen at the ballpark in his private suite. McCovey had attended games at AT&T Park as recently as the season finale.\n\n\"I love him so much. It's a very sad day for me. We were very close,\" Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda said in a telephone interview. \"Willie McCovey was not only a great ballplayer but a great teammate. He didn't have any fear. He never complained.\n\n\"I remember one time in 1960 they sent him down to the minor leagues after being Rookie of the Year the year before. He didn't complain. He was very polite, he was very quiet. He was a great man, a great friend. I'm going to miss him so much. He didn't say a bad word about anybody.\"\n\nWhile the Giants captured their third World Series title of the decade in 2014, McCovey returned to watch them play while still recovering from an infection that hospitalized him that September for about a month.\n\nHe attended one game at AT&T Park during both the NL Championship Series and World Series. He even waited for the team at the end of the parade route inside San Francisco's Civic Center.\n\n\"It was touch and go for a while,\" McCovey said at the time. \"They pulled me through, and I've come a long way.\"\n\nMcCovey had been thrilled the Giants accomplished something he didn't during a decorated career in the major leagues.\n\nEven four-plus decades later, it still stung for the left-handed slugging \"Big Mac\" that he never won a World Series after coming so close. The Giants lost the 1962 World Series to the New York Yankees.\n\nHe often thought about that World Series, and it remained difficult to accept. The Giants lost 1-0 in Game 7 when McCovey lined out to second baseman Bobby Richardson with runners on second and third for the final out.\n\n\"I still think about it all the time. I still think, 'If I could have hit it a little more,'\" he said on Oct. 31, 2014.\n\nIn 2012, he said: \"I think about the line drive, yes. Can't get away from it.\"\n\nMcCovey narrowly beat out Mets pitcher Tom Seaver for the 1969 MVP award. McCovey led the NL in home runs (45) and RBIs (126) for the second straight year, batting .320 while also posting NL bests with a .453 on-base percentage and .656 slugging percentage. He was walked 121 times, then drew a career-high 137 free passes the next season.\n\nHe had been third in the '68 voting for NL MVP, but after 1969 would never again finish higher than ninth.\n\nMcCovey and Ted Williams before him were among the first players to really face infield shifts as opponents tried to affect his rhythm at the plate.\n\nOn Wednesday night, former teammate Felipe Alou recalled inviting McCovey to play winter ball with him in 1958 for Escogido in Alou's native Dominican Republic.\n\nMcCovey got homesick, so a still-single Alou moved out of his parents' home and into an apartment with his dear friend and teammate. They were roommates in the minors and majors, too. McCovey called Alou \"Rojas,\" his father's last name. Alou called him \"Willie Lee,\" McCovey's middle name.\n\n\"We had a great relationship. Incredible friend and player and individual,\" Alou said. \"I have so many good memories.\"\n\nMcCovey was born on Jan. 10, 1938, in Mobile, Alabama. He had spent the last 18 years in a senior advisory role for the Giants.\n\n\"For more than six decades, he gave his heart and soul to the Giants,\" team president and CEO Larry Baer said. \"As one of the greatest players of all time, as a quiet leader in the clubhouse, as a mentor to the Giants who followed in his footsteps, as an inspiration to our Junior Giants, and as a fan cheering on the team from his booth.\"\n\nSaid McCovey's wife, Estela, whom he married this summer: \"Every moment he will be terribly missed. He was my best friend and husband. Living life without him will never be the same.\"\n\nMcCovey had a daughter, Allison, and three grandchildren, Raven, Philip, and Marissa. McCovey also is survived by sister Frances and brothers Clauzell and Cleon.\n\nMcCovey said that 2010 victory, when the Giants won the franchise's first World Series championship since moving from New York in 1958, helped eased the pain for players like him, Juan Marichal, Mays and Alou. Seeing San Francisco in the Fall Classic again brought those smiles back to McCovey's face.\n\n\"We're kind of getting spoiled,\" he said in 2012. \"This is two in three years. People don't realize how hard it is to get here. We've been pretty lucky.\"\n\nMcCovey presented the \"Willie Mac Award\" each season \u2014 except in 2014 while dealing with complications from the infection \u2014 an honor voted on by the players, coaches and training staff to recognize the team's player most exhibiting McCovey's inspirational example both on the field and in the clubhouse. He was there this year as reliever Will Smith was honored.\n\n\"Something I will cherish forever,\" Smith wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \"May he Rest In Peace.\"\n\nWhen San Francisco opened its new waterfront ballpark in 2000, the cove beyond the right-field fence was named \"McCovey Cove\" in appreciation of all he did for the organization. There's a statue of McCovey's likeness on the other side of the water from where those splash hits land.\n\n\"Willie McCovey was one of our game's greatest power hitters. He won the National League MVP in 1969 and, alongside fellow Hall of Famer and Alabama native Willie Mays, was a key part of many memorable Giants' teams,\" Commissioner Rob Manfred said. \"For 22 years on the field and many more after retiring, Willie was a superb ambassador for the Giants and our game.\"\n\nThe Giants said a public celebration of McCovey's life would be held at a later date.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints face an unusual challenge this weekend.\n\nThey'll try to keep up with an offense every bit as potent as their own \u2014 and do so against one of the top-rated defenses in the NFL.\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton said dealing with the Los Angeles Rams' eighth-ranked defense will be a tall order in itself.\n\n\"It presents a ton of problems,\" Payton said. \"First off, the talent when you're talking about some of the top tackles and ends in the business \u2014 that that in itself is difficult. And then when you put it with an outstanding scheme, then you really have a challenge.\"\n\nBrees said Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh comprise the best interior defensive line he's faced since he was at Purdue and played a Georgia team fielding Marcus Stroud and Richard Seymour in the 2000 Outback Bowl (Georgia won, 28-25).\n\n\"At this level, it's really unheard of to have Suh and Donald in there,\" Brees said. \"Those guys are unbelievable.\"\n\nDonald and Suh have combined for 13 sacks, with Donald getting 10.\n\nThe Saints so far have held up well against the pass rush. Brees has been sacked nine times and generally has had enough time to make accurate throws. He was intercepted for the first time Sunday night in Minnesota when an edge-rusher was unblocked and closing quickly on him.\n\nOffensively, New Orleans ranks eighth in yards per game and second in points per game at 33.4. Brees' passing numbers have gone down lately, but more because of New Orleans' ability to run the ball more and control the clock with Mark Ingram returning from his four-game suspension.\n\nThe Saints are 3-0 since Ingram's return and have won six straight overall after losing to Tampa Bay in the season opener.\n\nBut the unbeaten Rams rank second offensively in yards per game (442.6) and have averaged 33 points, which rank third.\n\nBrees sees similarities between the Saints when he and Sean Payton first joined forces 13 seasons ago, and the Rams under 32-year-old offensive-minded head coach Sean McVay and 24-year-old Jared Goff, the 2016 top overall draft choice.\n\n\"We like to feel like over the last 13 years that we've kind of been at the forefront of offensive football ... taking the personnel that you have and being able to utilize it in some really unique ways,\" Brees said.\n\n\"You can't help but turn on the film and be intrigued by the things that they're doing. Obviously, I think Jared Goff is playing as well as anybody right now. He's got a bunch of weapons there at the receiver position that are lighting it up, Todd Gurley, one of the best backs in the league.\"\n\nBrees said that while he doesn't know McVay well, he said the Rams coach's youthful energy, enthusiasm and offensive background remind him of Payton to some extent, starting with the fact they both played quarterback in college and had offensive backgrounds as NFL assistants before their first head coaching jobs.\n\n\"What I've seen from his offenses and what I hear about him is there's a lot of those same traits, and it makes it really, really fun to play for a guy like that, because it makes it exciting and it gives you a ton of confidence,\" Brees said.\n\nBrees also said it is apparent that the pairing of McVay with Goff \"was a great match.\"\n\nSaints defensive end Cam Jordan said his unit should be confident in its ability to slow Los Angeles if it plays largely mistake-free schematically and tackles well throughout, especially against Gurley.\n\n\"When we're able to execute at a high level, I don't think there's anybody on the field that can stop us. We have to be able to do that for all 60 minutes though,\" Jordan said.\n\nNotes: Saints rookie defensive end Marcus Davenport missed practice because of a toe injury. He did not confirm reports that he would be out for about a month, saying he's seeking multiple opinions and hasn't ruled out playing against the Rams on Sunday. He played with the injury at Minnesota, where he had two sacks, giving him a total of four through his first seven NFL games. The injury occurred during his sack of the Vikings' Kirk Cousins in the third quarter. Davenport said he had to play differently afterward, and tried to \"not think about it and just go out there and try to ball and take as many chances as I could.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/tags/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

No question about it.\"\n\nFour years later, not a lot has changed about Belichick's affinity for Rodgers or his abilities as the Patriots prepare to host Green Bay on Sunday night.\n\nIt presents the latest challenge for a New England defense that has had issues slowing teams down this season, particularly in the secondary.\n\nFollowing the departure of defensive coordinator Matt Patricia to the Lions, the Patriots have struggled with consistency in 2018.\n\nThey currently rank in the bottom half of the NFL in both total defense (25th, 383 yards per game) and passing yards allowed (22nd, 227 yards per game).\n\nStopping the pass was a major issue in both of New England's losses.\n\nBlake Bortles threw for 376 yards and four touchdowns, including a 61-yarder to Dede Westbrook in the fourth quarter of the Jaguars' 31-20 win in Week 2.\n\nA week later, Matt Stafford had just nine incompletions and passed for 262 yards and two touchdowns in leading the Lions to a 26-10 victory.\n\nAnd though the Patriots were able to pull out a 43-40 win against the Chiefs, it came despite Patrick Mahomes lighting up the defense for 352 yards and four TDs through the air.\n\nThe similarities in all those games were the ability of the three quarterbacks to create time and space with their legs.\n\nRodgers isn't expected to be as mobile as he continues to be slowed by the knee injury he sustained in Green Bay's season opener. But he's still managed to complete 61 percent of his passes while throwing for 13 touchdowns and just one interception.\n\nPatriots cornerback Jason McCourty was with the Titans in 2016 when they beat the Packers 47-25 in a game that saw Rodgers throw two interceptions.\n\nBut he said he isn't counting on getting anything less than Rodgers' best this time around.\n\n\"I really don't want to compare anybody to Aaron Rodgers, so I won't go that route,\" McCourty said. \"At the end of the day, however many football games you can play in preparation to help you get ready for this guy. ... He'll probably be the best quarterback we play against this year for sure.\"\n\nLikewise, Rodgers is expecting to see various defensive looks from Belichick to get him off his game.\n\n\"Bill is a phenomenal coach and he's always going to have his guys ready to play,\" he said. \"They do a number of different things \u2014 they don't just always major in one specific thing. They're going to try to combat what you do best and take it away and get you off schedule and lock down the guys they want to take away and make you beat them with your third and fourth options.\"\n\nNew England's secondary has shown improvement during its five-game win streak. Part of the reason is the support it has gotten up front from the defensive line.\n\nA week after giving up 31 points to Chicago, the Patriots responded by limiting Buffalo's offense to just six points on a day in which Tom Brady and his offense struggled.\n\nThe defense had three sacks, including two from linebacker Kyle Van Noy. But the play of the game came from safety Devin McCourty, who picked off Buffalo quarterback Derek Anderson late in the fourth quarter and returned it 84 yards for a touchdown.\n\nNew England's 11 interceptions are tied for the second-most in the league through eight weeks.\n\nDefensive end Trey Flowers said helping the secondary find similar success against Rodgers will hinge on their ability to speed up Rodgers in the pocket.\n\n\"We definitely will need to try to contain him as much as we can,\" Flowers said. \"You flush him out the pocket and he's still good. Keep him in the pocket and he's still great. We just gotta continue to push and get him rattled up a little bit and do the best we can.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nThe Halloween candy isn't even eaten yet and we're diving right into make-believe lands with giant gingerbread men in \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.\"\n\nDisney's new live-action version (in theaters Friday) of the classic E.T.A. Hoffman story is a holiday-ready tale centering on young Clara Stahlbaum (Mackenzie Foy) as she takes a fantasy journey to a colorful landscape of warring factions, where she has to save the day.\n\nWe know you might have a few burning questions about \u201cNutcracker,\u201d so here are some (mostly) helpful answers.\n\nShiver (Richard E. Grant), the Sugar Plum Fairy (Keira Knightley) and Hawthorne (Eugenio Derbez) give the lay of the lands to Clara (Mackenzie Foy) in \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.\" (Photo: LAURIE SPARHAM/DISNEY ENTERPRISES)\n\nFirst off, why are we getting a 'Nutcracker' movie, anyway?\n\nDisney's in a groove doing nonanimated versions of iconic stories (\"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"Beauty and the Beast\") so this tracks with that mindset. Also, moolah: It's good to get out in front of the family-friendly stuff before the onslaught that's coming Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nWhat's the least we need to know going in?\n\nClara's mom has recently died and her family is feeling the loss on Christmas Eve, as they ready to go to a swanky holiday party. Her mother left Clara a mysterious locked metal egg without a key; at the shindig, Clara finds a literal thread that leads her to the magical Christmas Tree Forest and the entry to a wondrous place.\n\nClara (Mackenzie Foy) ventures into the magical Christmas Tree Forest in \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.\" (Photo: LAURIE SPARHAM/DISNEY ENTERPRISES)\n\nWhat's up with these Four Realms?\n\nApparently, Clara's mom was the queen of a quartet of cool locales, and her death led to a destabilization. When Clara arrives, the Sugar Plum Fairy (Keira Knightley, doing her best high-pitched Peppa Pig voice) is the regent of the Land of Sweets, Shiver (Richard E. Grant) leads the Land of Snowflakes, and Hawthorne (Eugenio Derbez) heads up the Land of Flowers. They're all gearing up for battle against Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren), the tyrannical matriarch of the dark Fourth Realm (what once was the Land of Amusements and now is just a place with really creepy clowns).\n\nThat all sounds pretty dry. Does it ever get interesting?\n\nWithout saying too much, there's an effective and villainous heel turn for one of the \"good guys,\" who then raises an army of Nutcracker automatons.\n\nMisty Copeland struts her stuff as the Ballerina Princess in \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.\" (Photo: LAURIE SPARHAM)\n\n'Nutcracker' is a famous ballet. Any cool dance scenes?\n\nThe highlight of the movie is real-life dance phenom Misty Copeland as a Ballerina Princess who performs a minihistory of the Four Realms to get Clara (and the audience) up to speed. Bonus points for the visual of Copeland dancing with a wind-up mouse the size of a human. (There are a lot of mice in this movie.)\n\nAlso, isn't there well-known music associated with 'Nutcracker'?\n\nOh, yeah, and we get snippets of Tchaikovsky's greatest hits sprinkled throughout. For those more into modern artists, Andrea Bocelli and his 21-year-old son Matteo sing a new (and very Disney) ballad, \"Fall on Me,\" during the end credits. It's not bad!\n\nDrosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman) is a wise old world traveler - and Clara's godfather - in \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.\" (Photo: LAURIE SPARHAM/DISNEY ENTERPRISES)\n\nWhy does Morgan Freeman have an eye patch?\n\nAn excellent question \u2013 and one that isn't actually answered. His wise inventor character, Drosselmeyer, is Clara's godfather and raised her orphaned mom. There's not nearly enough of him in this, though. (Give this man a prequel!)\n\nPhillip the Nutcracker (Jayden Fowara-Knight, left) acts as helpful protector and sidekick to Clara (Mackenzie Foy) in \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.\" (Photo: LAURIE SPARHAM/DISNEY ENTERPRISES)\n\nWho else is in the movie that we might know?\n\nYou might remember Foy from her stint as a vampire kid in the \"Twilight\" films. Matthew Macfadyen, whose milquetoasty character is a highlight of the HBO drama \"Succession,\" plays Clara's sad dad. More notable is newcomer Jayden Fowora-Knight, sporting an adventurous John Boyega vibe, who co-stars as Capt. Phillip Hoffman, the earnest Nutcracker soldier who's also Clara's earnest sidekick.\n\nIs this OK for my kids to see?\n\nYeah, it has pretty broad appeal for little ones. The dead mom thing \u2013 a classic Disney trope \u2013 is a key aspect but mainly used to inspire Clara. The aforementioned creepy clowns and Nutcracker automatons lean more playful than actually dangerous, and children will really dig the ballet stuff. The only thing that may freak out kids \u2013 and some adults \u2013 is the Mouse King, a fearsome character made up of 60,000 computer-generated squirming mice. (Told you.)\n\nMother Ginger (Helen Mirren) is marked by cracks in her face and an antagonistic mindset in 'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.\" (Photo: LAURIE SPARHAM/DISNEY ENTERPRISES)\n\nDo any actual nuts get cracked during the film?\n\nSadly, no. Though there are \"cracks\" in Mother Ginger's face that symbolize her breaking from the status quo. And a broken chandelier.\n\nSo is the movie any good?\n\nIt's pretty forgettable. Unrealized potential abounds in those fantasy worlds, and there's quite a bit of overacting (looking at you, Keira). \"Nutcracker\" fans at least have the ballet sequence and the music, plus little girls have some heroic qualities to like in Clara, so it's not a complete holiday turkey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/01/10-burning-questions-disney-new-nutcracker-movie/1825370002/"]
