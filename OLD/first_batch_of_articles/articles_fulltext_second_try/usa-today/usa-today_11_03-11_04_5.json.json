Col. Tracy A. Bunko.\n\nThe development is \u201can extremely good sign,\u201d Bunko said, adding that the academy is \u201cgrateful for the outpouring of support and optimistic for Aurora\u2019s recovery.\u201d\n\nThe falcon will continue to be evaluated and will get antibiotics to prevent infection, Bunko said.\n\nArmy officials at West Point apologized Sunday for the injuries to the falcon and promised a full investigation.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this situation very seriously, and this occurrence does not reflect the Army or USMA core values of dignity and respect,\u201d the academy said in a statement.\n\nSam Dollar, Air Force\u2019s falconry team adviser, told The New York Times on Sunday that two West Point cadets took the birds, threw sweaters over them and stuffed them into dog crates. Dollar said the cadets turned over the birds Saturday morning, with Aurora\u2019s wings bloodied \u2013 likely from thrashing inside the crate.\n\n\u201cI think they had them for a couple hours and then they realized it was a bad mistake,\u201d Dollar told the newspaper. \u201cWhen Aurora started thrashing around in the crate, they decided that wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\n\nMore: Air Force falcon mascot seriously injured in prank before football game at Army\n\nMisery Index Week 10: Ed Orgeron throws players under bus, takes big risk after LSU loss\n\nAurora is the Air Force Academy\u2019s official and oldest mascot.

(Photo: Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 Kevin Harvick\u2019s repeat victory at the AAA Texas 500 came with the same reward: a chance to compete for the title in two weeks.\n\nHarvick secured a berth in the Championship 4 with Sunday\u2019s overtime victory at Texas Motor Speedway, leaving only two spots left entering next weekend\u2019s Can-Am 500 at ISM Raceway outside Phoenix.\n\nHarvick, who claimed the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship in 2014, won the first two stages and led half the race, reclaiming the lead from Ryan Blaney with less than 20 laps left and then holding off the Team Penske driver on two late restarts.\n\n\u201cReally, that\u2019s what you race for, to get yourself in position to be in the playoffs and then position yourself to have a chance to at Homestead,\u201d Harvick said after his season-high eighth victory. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy this time of year because everybody is throwing everything they have at it. To get victory lane, that\u2019s our goal. That\u2019s how you control your destiny the most, instead of counting fingers and toes what you need to do.\u201d\n\nLast November\u2019s victory was Harvick\u2019s first at this track. He finished second here in April after an unscheduled pit stop ruined another dominant run.\n\n\"We've loved it here since they repaved it,\" said Harvick crew chief Rodney Childers. \"We had great race cars last year. The spring hurt us a little bit. We had such a great race car, and we were able to bring the same car back with some updates and do great again tonight. It's an awesome feeling.\"\n\nJoey Logano, who finished third, secured his chance to compete for the championship at the Nov. 18 season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway with a victory at Martinsville Speedway one week ago. The driver he spun out to win that race, Martin Truex Jr., was among the Round of 8 drivers who struggled with penalties.\n\nTruex rebounded early in the race on the 1.5-mile oval after he started in the back of the field because of an engine change. He was sent back again around the midpoint of the race after he was penalized for rolling through more than three pit stalls on a pit stop.\n\nAfter another drive through the field and a timely caution, Truex rebounded again to finish ninth, good enough to drop just one spot in the playoff standings to third.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, God is testing us,\" Truex said. \"There\u2019s no question. Just a tough day. Overall, a good day. Luckily we were able to get up front and get some stage points in the first two stages.\n\nTruex said the team is \"in decent shape going to Phoenix.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ll go there and race hard again and see what we can do,\" Truex added.\n\nKyle Busch, who entered the race atop the playoff standings, was hit with a speeding violation on pit road and had to make an unscheduled pit stop before the midpoint of the race. He spent much of the rest of the race trying to get back on the lead lap en route to finishing 17th.\n\nBusch enters next Sunday's race second to only Harvick in the standings.\n\nClint Bowyer\u2019s chances of making the Championship 4 dimmed when his car, which started on the front row, rode up the track and clipped Denny Hamlin on the first turn of the first lap, a collision that sent both to the pits. That led to an unscheduled pit stop to address the damage that collision caused along with a penalty later in the race because one of his crew members was caught sitting on the wall \u2014 a violation of pit lane rules.\n\nBowyer never recoverd and finished 26th. That sets up a must-win situation for the Stewart-Haas Racing driver, who has led only 22 laps in 26 starts in Phoenix. His average finish is 18.4 with only two top-5 finishes, the last coming a decade ago.\n\nAric Almirola and Chase Elliott \u00ad\u2014 two others drivers who made the Round of 8 \u2014 also almost certainly need a victory next Sunday to gain entry to the Championship 4.\n\nNASCAR announced three drivers, in addition to Truex, would start at the back of the field just before the start of the race: Almirola (unapproved body modifications), William Byron (failed inspection) and seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson (failed inspection).\n\nBut there was one issue \u2013\u2013 Johnson was penalized by NASCAR by mistake. The rules for Texas stated cars could fail inspection three times, not the the more typical two times. Johnson only failed twice, a mistake that was not announced until more than 100 laps into the race.\n\nJohnson, who spun out Hendrick Motorsports teammate Byron on Lap 98, rebounded to lead briefly twice as race as cars shuffled into the pits. He finished 15th, partly due to NASCAR issuing a pass-through penalty after officials caught a crew member hopping into the pit box too soon.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' A.J.

(AP Photo/John Locher) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Bryson DeChambeau saw signs of greatness last season on the PGA Tour when he won three times against the strongest fields this side of the majors.\n\nHe started a new season headed down the same path.\n\nIn his only fall start, DeChambeau never shot worse than 66 over four days in Las Vegas, holed an eagle putt from just inside 60 feet on the 16th hole and closed with smart play for pars to win the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open on Sunday by one shot over Patrick Cantlay.\n\n\"I was coming out here to try and kick rust off and was able to play some good golf,\" DeChambeau said. \"I'm happy to get it done.\"\n\nThe eagle putt took him from a one-shot deficit to a two-shot lead when Cantlay made bogey from a deceptive lie in the bunker ahead of him on the 17th hole. DeChambeau won for the fourth time in his last 12 starts on the PGA Tour and moved to No. 5 in the world ranking.\n\nHe had to survive a wild back nine at the TPC Summerlin in which four players had a share of the lead at some point.\n\nCantlay, trying to become the first player to win back-to-back in Las Vegas in nearly 20 years, made a 15-foot birdie putt on the par-5 16th hole to take a one-shot lead. But from a bunker right of the green on the par-3 17th, Cantlay was fooled by the amount of sand under his ball and flubbed the shot.\n\nDeChambeau wasn't entirely sure where he stood. He could see Cantlay made the putt on the 16th hole and had to ask if it was for birdie or eagle. DeChambeau easily cleared the water, and his ball went just over the back of the green. He thought he hit it perfectly. Then, he thought he might have hit it too hard. It held its line at the end, and DeChambeau responded with a big uppercut.\n\n\"I haven't given a reaction like that in a while,\" he said.\n\nCantlay birdied the 18th for a 65, but it wasn't enough when DeChambeau played the final two holes conservatively for pars to finish at 21-under 263.\n\nDeChambeau won for the third straight season, and fifth time overall on the PGA Tour.\n\nThe 25-year-old American began his big run with a playoff victory at the Memorial, and then won consecutive FedEx Cup playoff events in New Jersey and Boston. He said he was playing Las Vegas to shake off a little rust, and it turned into another victory.\n\n\"I thought I had it in me, but I didn't know if I could do it,\" DeChambeau said. \"Last year I saw signs of something great. I didn't know where it would lead me. But I think it led me in the right direction.\"\n\nNot since Jim Furyk in 1998-99 had anyone successfully defended his title in Las Vegas, and Cantlay looked as if he might get it done when he drove the green on the par-4 15th for a two-putt birdie, and then rolled in another good birdie after having to lay up on the 16th. His tee shot into the 17th was a fraction away from catching a slope and feeding toward the hole. Instead, it tumbled into the bunker to set up what appeared to be a relatively simple shot.\n\n\"When I dug my left foot in, it didn't have a bunch of sand, and then obviously when I hit my shot there was more sand under the ball and didn't anticipate that,\" Cantlay said. \"It was a tricky one and I hit a poor shot.\"\n\nHe wasn't the only player stung by the outcome.\n\nFormer U.S. Open champion Lucas Glover had a 4-foot birdie putt on the 15th hole that would have given him a share of the lead with three holes to play. Glover missed the putt, and then missed a 30-inch par putt. One hole later, he was three shots behind.\n\nGlover finished with a triple bogey for a 71 and tied for seventh. He shot 61 on Saturday.\n\nPeter Uihlein, who shared the 54-hole lead with DeChambeau, didn't make a birdie until the 11th hole, finished bogey-bogey for a 75 and tied for 23rd.\n\nSam Ryder was one shot behind when his second shot to the par-5 16th bounced off a knob and back into the water. He managed to save par and birdied the last hole with a 15-foot putt for a 62 to finish alone in third.\n\nRickie Fowler (63), Abraham Ancer (66) and Robert Streb (68) were another shot behind.\n\nDeChambeau won for the fifth time in just his 68th start as a pro on the PGA Tour, dating to his victory in the John Deere Classic in 2017.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Elaine Thompson/AP)\n\nVoters in Washington state are asking themselves an important question: Should one of the cleanest, greenest states in the nation saddle itself with billions in new energy taxes for a badly written measure that will have no impact on climate change?\n\nInitiative 1631 is a deeply flawed, unfairly drafted energy tax that would force Washington families, small businesses, farmers and consumers to pay higher costs for gasoline, heating fuels, electricity and natural gas as well as for goods and services.\n\nIt would impose a $15 fee per ton on certain carbon emissions beginning in 2020, increasing by $2 each year plus inflation, quadrupling within 15 years, with no limit on how high it could go.\n\nA state analysis shows that the initiative would increase energy taxes by $2.3 billion in the first five years alone.\n\nOUR VIEW: How Washington (the state) can fight climate change\n\nThis tax would especially hurt low-income and fixed-income households, seniors and working families who can least afford to pay more. The fact that the measure includes language purporting to mitigate these impacts is further evidence of the regressive nature of the proposal. It would also damage our state\u2019s economy.\n\nA study by National Economic Research Associates consulting firm found that the $30 billion in new taxes collected over 15 years would cost the equivalent of 21,300 jobs and reduce the gross state product by $5.3 billion. Gasoline prices would increase by 13 cents per gallon in the first year alone, increasing annually with no cap, adding up to 59 cents more per gallon within 15 years.\n\nAll told, the firm estimates total costs per household at $440 in 2020, increasing to $990 by 2035.\n\nFinally, the initiative provides no specific spending plan, too little accountability and no requirements to reduce greenhouse gases. It gives an unelected board of political appointees a blank check to spend billions as they choose, without real legislative oversight or accountability to voters.\n\nThe initiative is a costly, unfair and ineffective tax that would damage our state\u2019s economy and would block the pathway to meaningful climate policy.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nMartin Rogers crosses the finish line at the New York City Marathon on Nov. 4. It was his first 26.2-mile race. (Photo: Derik Hamilton, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 The TCS New York Marathon is actually two races, the one for the elite professionals with their ludicrous split times and impossibly beautiful strides, and another for everyone else.\n\nLong, long after Mary Keitany and Lelisa Desisa clinched their respective victories on Sunday, a shambling wreck (me), staggered over the finish line in Central Park at a turtle\u2019s pace.\n\nIt was my first journey over the tortuous 26.2 miles, not just in New York but anywhere, and for the most part it was everything I dreamed it would be. That\u2019s not to diminish it, on the contrary, it was the kind of feeling you get when your dreams come true.\n\nMy time was horrible, more than half an hour later than my target after an inevitable encounter with the dreaded wall, but the experience was unforgettable.\n\nI\u2019d fantasized about the extraordinary well-wishers across the five boroughs of this remarkable city, expected agonies both localized and mental that I\u2019d never felt the like of, prepared for the emotion of seeing my parents and dear friends along the route and at the conclusion.\n\nExcept one thing. My wife, the one person who I most wanted on hand for one of my life's unforgettable moments, was not there.\n\nThere were a multitude of reasons why New York had to be the first marathon I tackled and most of them had to do with timing and sentiment. I turn 40 on Monday and the race always falls around my birthday, or sometimes on it. My wife and I decided where and when we\u2019d get married on Nov. 5 six years ago. But, more than anything, it is a time that conjures the most conflicting of mixed emotions.\n\nOn Nov. 6, 2013, our baby daughter Sophia was born after only 25 weeks pregnancy, and passed away the next day when her tiny lungs could not support her. This time of year is the toughest of all.\n\nI thought of her on the run, towards the humbling end, and I wish I could say it inspired me to a flurry of fresh energy. In reality, it simply got me to the finish line, when that outcome looked in doubt as I shuffled no quicker than a walk with a few miles remaining.\n\nI saw a couple of dear and cherished journalist friends along the way, and one more at the end, but the thing that truly moves you about this race is the pure humanity of complete strangers willing you on at virtually every turn. From the first steps off the Verrazzano Narrows bridge into Brooklyn, into Queens, across the treacherous Queensboro Bridge into the swarm of Manhattan crowds, amid the booming street parties of Harlem and finally down towards the most blessed rest ever.\n\nTo be able to stop, or wobble to a stop, felt incredible. The only thing that could have made it better, was if my wife had been present.\n\nI wish she had been there, but I\u2019m delighted she wasn\u2019t. There was a good reason why, the best reason in the world, and the only one that would have kept her away. After five years of grieving and four years of trying, a strange thing happened over the summer. She was getting hungry more often, and began putting on weight. Fertility treatment hadn\u2019t worked, but somehow, after we stopped IVF and when we least expected it, Carol is pregnant again. With a baby girl.\n\nWhen you lose a baby you don\u2019t just lose a person, but it is the death of all the dreams you imagined and the memories that never happened except for in your mind\u2019s eye.\n\nIt feels OK to dream again now ... and during the 26.2 miles I did. I dreamed of what life with the baby will be like, and the thought that maybe, one day, we could run this infernal thing together.\n\nOops, there it is, just hours after swearing to never run another one, New York has reeled me back in. What a magical race.\n\nRogers finished his first New York City Marathon in 4:40:21.

(Photo: Ted S. Warren/AP)\n\nWashington, D.C., remains hopelessly gridlocked on the existential threat posed by human-induced climate change. But in Washington state, there's an opportunity to do something about it on Election Day.\n\nThere, for the first time in the United States, voters will choose whether to tax carbon emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere.\n\nWhile one state's success in reducing its carbon footprint will not save the planet, passage of Initiative 1631 on Tuesday would show that people who are rightly concerned about global warming are willing to act \u2014 and demonstrate that carbon taxes don't translate into economic ruination.\n\nAbout 20 percent of global emissions are already impacted by carbon pricing. Initiative 1631 would be the first greenhouse gas tax levied by ballot initiative. It employs real-world compromise, exempting the state's huge aerospace industry and Washington's largest polluter, a coal-fired plant in Centralia that is already slated to phase out coal by 2025.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW: Washingtonians, reject Initiative 1631\n\nEven with these exceptions, the ballot measure would target 80 percent of the state's greenhouse gas pollution. The fee ($15 per ton of carbon dioxide, starting in 2020) would rise for inflation and, for large emitters, by $2 per year through 2035.\n\nSeventy percent of the money raised would be invested in clean energy projects; 25 percent would go to protect water and forests. And the measure would provide tens of millions of dollars for communities and workers hurt by the tax.\n\nUnsurprisingly, opposition to 1631 is strongest from the oil and gas industry, which has ponied up most of $26 million that has been raised to fight the initiative. It remains unclear how much of the fee for major emitters will be passed along to consumers. Estimates are that costs will increase about 13 cents a gallon at the gas pump and 18 cents a gallon for home heating oil.\n\nThat's not chump change, but the whole point of a carbon tax \u2014 and the reason why a recent landmark, United Nations climate report highlighted the centrality of the concept \u2014 is to prevent industries that burn coal, oil and natural gas from continuing to use the earth's atmosphere as a free waste dump.\n\nTaxing carbon pollution is a simple, market-based means of curbing the practice and making renewable energy sources more competitive.\n\nOther state ballots are populated with environmental ideas that simply mandate change, such as Arizona's Proposition 127 and Nevada's Question 6, which would require utilities to produce at least half of their electricity from renewable sources.\n\nThose are blunt-edged approaches. Far better is a market-based alternative such as a carbon tax that levels the playing field so green-energy sources can gain traction. It's why Republican elder statesmen such as James Baker, Henry Paulson and George Shultz last year endorsed a national carbon tax, the proceeds of which would be rebated to consumers.\n\nWashington's ballot measure could offer a worthwhile template for other states and \u2014 who knows? \u2014 maybe one day for lawmakers in Washington, D.C. To those who argue that we can't afford to do anything about climate disruption, the only answer is that we can't afford not to.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 As harbingers go, this was quite a start for the Washington Redskins.\n\nAfter a 4-yard run on the opening play of the game, the hosts' initial possession featured a holding penalty, a sack for a loss of 9 yards, an injured left knee for left guard Shawn Lauvao \u2014 who was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair \u2014 and a three-and-out punt.\n\nWashington's following drive also ended in a punt, but not before Alex Smith threw a ball that hit a Falcons defender's helmet, receiver Josh Doctson dropped a pair of passes, and right tackle Morgan Moses limped off with an injured right knee, although he later returned.\n\nNothing really went right for the mistake-prone Redskins on Sunday in a 38-14 loss to Matt Ryan, Julio Jones and the Atlanta Falcons that ended the three-game winning streak that put Washington atop the NFC East.\n\n\"It was a bad game, but it was one game,\" Redskins linebacker Ryan Kerrigan said. \"We can't let that happen again.\"\n\nA Skins defense that came in ranked No. 2 in the NFL against the run and No. 4 overall turned in a real clunker.\n\nAtlanta gained 154 yards on the ground, averaging 6.4 per carry. Worth noting: The Falcons last ran for more than 100 in Week 2.\n\n\"Caught us with our pants down and hit us in the mouth,\" Washington cornerback Josh Norman said.\n\nThere were several other issues for the Redskins.\n\nAt one point in the second quarter, Atlanta was outgaining Washington 229-41.\n\nThe Falcons were 8 for 8 on third-down conversions before halftime.\n\nWashington finished with 10 penalties for 147 yards, and some players thought the officiating was to blame.\n\n\"Might as well just give them the ball,\" coach Jay Gruden said, \"and give them the game.\"\n\nAtlanta (4-4) began the third quarter with an eight-play drive that finished with Ryan's third of four TD passes for the afternoon \u2014 a 10-yarder to running back Tevin Coleman \u2014 that boosted its advantage to 28-7.\n\nWashington then punted after its possession was derailed by penalties: one for taunting on Doctson, another for unsporstmanlike conduct on Moses, and a holding call on Pro Bowl right guard Brandon Scherff (who soon exited with a hurt left shoulder, joining starters Lauvao and left tackle Trent Williams, who had thumb surgery last week, on the sideline).\n\nAtlanta put together touchdown drives that covered 86, 81 and 75 yards in the first half, then another 75-yarder to begin the second. A Redskins secondary that added starting safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix in a trade-deadline deal Tuesday \u2014 there was quite a bit of hand-gesturing by safety D.J. Swearinger before snaps \u2014 gave up first-half TD passes by Ryan of 39 yards to Coleman and 40 yards to Calvin Ridley.\n\nThe capper was a 35-yarder in the fourth quarter to Jones, who dragged Clinton-Dix a bit at the end of the play for his first scoring catch in nearly a year.\n\nThe Redskins have thrived on offense with 33-year-old running back Adrian Peterson carrying the load. But he only ran nine times for a measly 17 yards through the opening two quarters, when Washington's best gain was 22 on a scramble by quarterback Alex Smith.\n\nNearly sacked, Smith spun out of a defender's arms and turned it into a run up the sideline ending with a pop from Atlanta's Brian Poole that was so big it drew an \"Ohhhhh!\" from spectators. It helped extend an 11-play, 80-yard drive that finished with Smith's 2-yard fade pass to Doctson for a TD that cut Washington's deficit to 14-7 late in the opening half.\n\nThat was just about it in terms of highlights for the Redskins.\n\n\"Got to be better,\" Swearinger said. \"Got to be disciplined.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo is taking his game to another level.\n\nHe had his second triple-double this season with 26 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists to help the Milwaukee Bucks rout the Sacramento Kings 144-109 on Sunday.\n\n\"A great win for the team,\" Antetokounmpo said, deflecting any sense of personal satisfaction. \"When I drove the ball, they were wide open. I passed it, and they knocked down everything.\"\n\nThe Bucks improved to 8-1 \u2014 the best nine-game start in franchise history. They set a season high for points in a game and also set the franchise record for 3s made with 22.\n\nCoach Mike Budenholzer was happy his team followed Antetokounmpo's lead.\n\n\"Hopefully, one of the keys to Giannis being great is everybody around him being great,\" the Bucks first-year coach said. \"We can also talk about a lot of other guys who played well, too. So, that's a great sign for Giannis and a great sign for us.\"\n\nSeven other Bucks were in double figures. Eric Bledsoe scored 17, Ersan Ilyasova 15, Malcolm Brogdon and Pat Connaughton each had 13, Tony Snell and Khris Middleton each had 12 and John Henson 10.\n\n\"Coach Bud (head coach Mike Budenholzer) wants me to make plays and find them,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"That is what I am going to keep doing. It feels great.\"\n\nAntetokounmpo completed the triple-double with his 10th assist when he found Connaughton in the corner for 3 and a 108-82 lead as time expired in the third quarter. Antetokounmpo finally went to the bench with 7:48 left in the fourth and the Bucks comfortably ahead 118-90.\n\nHe pushed the lead to 78-54 with two thunderous dunks seconds apart in the third quarter. He slammed one home and then dunked again on a pass from Middleton after a turnover by De'Aaron Fox on the Kings' ensuing possession.\n\nAntetokounmpo's first triple-double came against the Philadelphia 76ers on Oct. 24th when he had 32 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nJustin Jackson set a career-high with 22 points, Buddy Hield had 19 and De'Aaron Fox 15 for the Kings who had their five-game winning streak snapped.\n\nJackson felt the team was still upbeat despite the most lopsided loss this season. The Kings had lost 149-129 at New Orleans on Oct. 19.\n\n\"We just went 3-1 on a four-game road trip,\" Jackson said. \"Obviously, it hurts a little bit to lose like that, but I think we're extremely happy of how we played this road trip.\"\n\nThe Bucks started to take over with 12-2 run in the second quarter, keyed by seven points from Malcolm Brogdon, and led 72-48 on Ersan Ilyasova's 3 with 49 seconds left before the half.\n\nIlyasova scored 15 points and Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe each added 13 as the Bucks surged to their best first half of scoring so far this season and led 72-50 heading into the third.

(Photo: NONE, GANNETT)\n\nTravelers have so much to be thankful for, right?\n\nWell, kind of.\n\nIn some ways, travel has never been safer, more affordable or more accessible. But in other equally important ways, it's costly, fraught with hassles and maddening. And since it's that time of the year when people celebrate gratitude (Thanksgiving is Nov. 22, but our neighbors in Canada already had theirs on Oct. 8), let's sort it all out.\n\nWhat you should be grateful for\n\nThere's a lot to be grateful for, travelers say.\n\nTravel is safer, especially if you're flying. Last year was the safest on record for air travel. Many travelers told me they were thankful for that.\n\nTravel is also inexpensive. Complain all you want \u2013 and I know you will \u2013 but travel is dirt cheap. Even air travel, with its many fees, is relatively inexpensive (the average fare in 2017 was $340, down from $352 a decade before ). If you want to know what that means to you, check out the Bureau of Transportation Statistics site for the airport closest to you.\n\nAnd that's not all.\n\n\"I\u2019m thankful for 20-cent beers in the Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka,\" world traveler and New York fireman Mike Biserta says. \"I\u2019m thankful for samosas in India, spring rolls in Thailand, momos in Nepal, tajine in Morocco and hummus in Israel \u2013 all for under a dollar.\"\n\nAnother reason to be grateful: You can go almost anywhere. With one or two notable exceptions, we have freedom of movement. For a list of countries you shouldn't visit, check the U.S. State Department website. Stay away from any country with a \"Level 4\" designation, the government's highest warning level.\n\n\"I'm grateful for U.S. citizenship, which allows me to travel to most countries without any visa issues,\" says Amber Bennett, a real estate agent from St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nWhat not to be thankful for\n\nOK, call me a Grinch, but gratitude is not the only emotion travelers feel this holiday travel season. Anger is another.\n\nFor example, I don't know anyone who is grateful to JetBlue Airways, which raised its baggage fees and expected its customers to be thankful. Why the increase? So the airline wouldn't have to raise fares amid higher fuel prices, according to CEO Robin Hayes. That makes some sense until you fast-forward to the next time fuel prices drop. Will JetBlue, and the other airlines that follow, lower their baggage fees?\n\nYou can stop laughing now.\n\nIt's also difficult to find anyone with a kind word to say about the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The lines are long, and the complaints are many. Earlier this year, in an attempt to bring some sanity to the TSA lines, Congress passed the \"Pre-Check is Pre-Check Act\" that would ensure only travelers who have undergone background and security checks can use TSA\u2019s Pre-Check lanes. Will that make security better? Don't hold your breath.\n\n\"I\u2019m not grateful for unclear security checks,\" says Laura Torres, a blogger who is traveling around the world. Yeah, she and everyone else.\n\nFor hotel guests, there's also the mandatory resort fee \u2013 sorry, make that the Daily Destination Fee. Overall, these extras have increased by almost 11 percent year over year, with the average resort fee now standing at around $21 a night, according to ResortFeeChecker.com, a site that tracks resort fees. No one liked these extras, which allegedly cover the cost of the exercise facility, use of the pool and \"free\" calls. But then a couple of hotels in New York got cute and decided to rename the resort fee a Daily Destination Fee.\n\nConsumer advocates say the fees, charged after you pay your room rate, are unfair, deceptive and should be illegal. Travelers would be grateful if hotels dropped these dreaded charges \u2013 or if the government required them to.\n\nThis Thanksgiving, travelers have lot to be thankful for \u2013 and a lot not to be thankful for. But on balance, 2018 isn't such a bad year for us road warriors. Of course, the holiday travel season is just getting started. Ask me again in January.\n\nMore things to be grateful for\n\n\u2022 Airport food: It's getting better. Sometimes, it's even worth the trip. \"I am especially grateful for prosciutto sandwiches in the Venice airport,\" says Ashley Rector, founder of Harness Magazine, a woman's magazine. \"They taste absolutely divine. Who would have thought airport food could be so good?\"\n\n\u2022 Sharing sites: What would we do without them? \"I'm grateful for Airbnb and Uber,\" says Tuanni Price, who writes a wine blog. \"They make it so easy. I can't imagine what people did before these companies.\" Well, they stayed in hotels and hailed taxis, but it was a lot more expensive and less interesting, that's for sure.\n\n\u2022 Wi-Fi on planes: It's practically on every flight \u2013 and now it also works. \"I'm grateful that now almost all planes have Wi-Fi,\" says McCall Renold, a business strategy consultant. \"It has gotten so much better than even a few years ago. Now airlines are letting you stream or message over Wi-Fi for free on your own devices, even without paying for the in-flight Wi-Fi.\"\n\nChristopher Elliott is a consumer advocate.

Curry's eye-popping stats now have NBA observers pondering a number that was unthinkable as recently as a few years ago: Could he hit 500 3-pointers?\n\nMORE NBA\n\nLAKERS: Maddening play continues in blowout loss vs. Raptors\n\nPISTONS: Casey brought shooting offense, but Detroit can't shoot\n\nTROLLING: Embiid mocks \"bum\" Drummond again after big game\n\n\"I've always said I want to continue to try to improve my shooting and get more efficient,\" Curry said last week after a win over the New Orleans Pelicans. \"Obviously a good start to that, but got to sustain it and stick to the program of what I've been doing.\"\n\nCurry has indeed improved his efficiency, and now in his 10th season, it's a major reason he's on record pace.\n\nAlready a career 47.7% shooter overall and 43.6% from 3-point range coming into the season, Curry is hitting 53.9% overall and 50.9% from deep in 10 games. His effective shooting percentage, which accounts for 3s being worth more, is a career-high 68.2%. His true shooting percentage, a measure of efficiency that takes into account all shots, is a career-high 71.5%.\n\nPerhaps most impressive is that Curry's 3-point surge this season has not come at the expense of the Warriors' usual game plan. His usage rate is slightly higher than his career percentage but right in line with the past three seasons. Curry is attempting 11.6 3s per game and taking 56.3% of his shots overall from long range, but those numbers too are comparable to the last three years.\n\nSo are 500 3-pointers really a possibility? It seems unlikely that even as great a shooter as Curry will continue to make over half his 3s, especially when he attempts such a high volume. However, it seems foolhardy to completely rule it out.\n\nThe Warriors have admitted in recent years that they sometimes struggle to find motivation during the regular season. If Curry can bump up his 3-point rate to closer to 60% and continue shooting near 50% on those shots, the notion of 500 could start to look real. Then that could be the drive Curry needs to shoot for a nice, round, historic number.\n\nFollow Matt Eppers on Twitter @meppers_.", "FILE - In this May 3, 2018, file photo, Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten announces his retirement from football at the NFL team's training facility and headquarters in Frisco, Texas. Witten vividly remembers Tony Romo\u2019s return to the home of the Cowboys for the first time as a broadcaster last year after retiring as the storied franchise\u2019s all-time passing leader. Now it is the 15-year tight end\u2019s turn. (AP Photo/Richard Rodriguez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Jason Witten vividly remembers Tony Romo's return to the home of the Dallas Cowboys for the first time as a broadcaster last year after retiring as the storied franchise's all-time passing leader.\n\nNow it's the 15-year tight end's turn.\n\nWitten's move from the field to ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" booth was a little more sudden and surprising than Romo's decision to join CBS after he had lost his job to Dak Prescott.\n\nThe club's career leader in catches and games was still a starter when he left, and probably a little more beloved than his best friend and former quarterback. The fans figure to illustrate as much when the Cowboys (3-4) host the pro team from Witten's home state, the Tennessee Titans (3-4), on Monday night.\n\n\"It will certainly be emotional for me,\" Witten said. \"Why wouldn't it be after 15 years and so many relationships inside that building with fans and teammates and management and coaches and all that stuff?\"\n\nUnlike Romo, Witten had a ceremony to say goodbye in the spring after he had already started his offseason training at the team's facility. The announcement days before his 36th birthday came after the realization that it would be difficult for Witten turn down a chance to be one of the NFL's lead analysts.\n\nAlso unlike Romo, Witten's transition has been rough. He's been criticized more than Romo, who was an instant hit by showing the ability to predict plays and has shown more an ability to connect with viewers.\n\nThe most notable moment for Witten so far came when he slipped and said Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers had pulled \"another rabbit out of his head\" with a tying touchdown pass late in a 33-30 overtime win against San Francisco.\n\n\"I would never walk into something like that and say, 'Hey, I'm going to be on this level from minute one,'\" Witten said. \"I'm not going to be perfect but I think over time if you listen, you win them over by saying, 'Man, the guy is sharing a lot of football with us that we didn't necessarily know.'\n\n\"I believe in myself. I believe I'll be good at it.\"\n\nWitten will have a friendly audience at AT&T Stadium, regardless of whether people are watching from their devices in the stands.\n\n\"His leadership in the locker room and the practice field throughout games was off the charts and a great example for all of us how to go about your job,\" Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. \"A rare guy, a special guy we are all fortunate to have been around.\"\n\nThe obvious question is whether Witten will hesitate to criticize Prescott, or Garrett, or any of the tight ends trying to replace him. Prescott thinks so.\n\n\"I expect Witten to be critical,\" said Prescott, who had Witten for his first two years in the league, both as the Dallas starter. \"I tell the story about when I first came in, how tough he was on me then. So now I don't expect it to be any different.\"\n\nWitten kept his composure during his 15-minute retirement speech in May at team headquarters, about 35 miles from the stadium. It should be pretty easy to do the same when he's shown from the booth, mostly likely after a tribute video on the giant screen that hangs above the field.\n\n\"I think that's why when I made the decision back in May, why I put so much time into it, was because I knew once I did I wasn't going to allow myself or was going to try really hard not to get to the emotions of it all,\" Witten said. \"Will it be different? Absolutely. Will be it be awkward going into that stadium? Of course it will be.\"\n\nJust as it was for Romo a year ago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 Another game, another argument.\n\nThe sports and entertainment group backing the Spanish league's bid to take a regular-season soccer game to the United States says it was contacted by the Spanish federation to discuss holding a separate game \u2014 the Super Cup final \u2014 in the country.\n\nThe federation, which has raised its concerns over the planned Barcelona-Girona league game near Miami in January, denied the claim by the Relevent group on Sunday. The federation said it had never sought the help of any company to take the \"Supercopa\" to the U.S.\n\nIn Spain, the league oversees the first and second divisions, while the federation organizes tournaments such as the Super Cup and the Copa del Rey.\n\nThe Super Cup pits the Spanish league champion against the Copa del Rey winner in a one-match final at the start of the season. This year's game was played between Barcelona and Sevilla in Tangier, Morocco.\n\nThe federation told The Associated Press it was Relevent that proposed having the Super Cup game in Miami in 2019. The federation said it had rejected the offer.\n\nIt said Relevent recently invited federation president Luis Rubiales to a dinner in New York as he was in the city for other business, but the federation denied this was to discuss the Super Cup game. The group's proposal had already been rejected by then and the meeting never happened.\n\nThe league's idea to play games in the U.S. to promote its brand has been supported by many but has also been met by criticism from soccer officials and some fans and clubs in Spain. The dispute has become a tug-of-war among the several stakeholders, with all sides trying to weigh-in and defend their ground.\n\nThis latest dispute seems unlikely to improve the situation.\n\n\"It is scandalous to offer the Spanish Super Cup in the USA to the same organization that has a partnership with LaLiga (Spanish league) while telling LaLiga it can't stage a match stateside,\" Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the AP in a league email written in English.\n\n\"It's clear that there is an inherent problem with a process when the federation deciding on approval is negotiating a similar deal concurrently,\" Tebas claimed. \"When it comes to the LaLiga match in the US, decisions and opinions by the governing bodies haven't been based on what's in the best interest of football globally, but how it impacts self interests and leverages business negotiations on unrelated matters.\"\n\nThe federation is yet to approve the league's request over the Barcelona-Girona game. While asking for clarification about the plan, the federation argued the league failed to show the overseas game would comply with Spanish and international regulations and TV broadcast contracts.\n\nIt also said the regular-season match away from Spain could harm the other 18 league clubs.\n\nThe Super Cup game doesn't affect other teams but Spanish fans would face a lengthy trip across the Atlantic for both matches. The league has offered compensation packages for Girona fans willing to watch the game in the U.S., including paid trips to Miami and partial reimbursement of season-ticket packages.\n\nThe FIFA Council recently opposed the league game plan after receiving a request to take a stance from CONCACAF and the federations in the United States and Spain, which both have a say on whether the game can be played, along with European governing body UEFA. FIFA's permission for the match is not mandatory but its opposition was a setback for the league.\n\nThe league said it is prepared to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if FIFA somehow prohibits the match, and it is also ready to go to court in Spain if the Spanish federation rejects its request to play abroad. The federation hasn't yet made a final ruling.\n\nThe league last week launched a campaign to show that American fans are behind the game, asking them to sign an online petition showing their support.\n\nThe league has a 15-year partnership with Relevent to promote soccer and bring games to the United States. The group operates the International Champions Cup, a tournament played around the globe during the European offseason in July and August.\n\nStaging the game in the U.S. is seen as an important step for the league to continue expanding internationally and to close the gap on the powerful English Premier League.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nVoting (Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The day is finally here. It's Election Day!\n\nWhether you're a Republican, Democrat, Independent or somewhere in between, we've got you covered all week.\n\nHere's a list of what you should know, whether you'll be heading to the polls, wondering why this year's midterms matter or seeking results Tuesday night and beyond.\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nBefore anything, it's important to know why your vote matters.\n\nThis year's midterm elections won't just decide who takes control of the House or Senate. The midterms are seen in large part as a referendum of President Donald Trump, whose two years as president have been tainted with controversy and scandal.\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives are elected to two-year terms, meaning all 435 seats are to be decided. The Senate is a different story, where lawmakers are elected for six-year terms; about a third stand for re-election every two years.\n\nMore: USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: The midterms are all about Trump, and Democrats have the edge in the stretch\n\nRelated: Exclusive: Donald Trump, buoyed by the campaign, looks ahead to a post-midterm presidency\n\nEnergetic Democrats are hoping to gain at least some control in Congress and many believe they have a good chance of taking over the House. Polls suggest it's likely that Republicans retain their majority in the Senate.\n\nIf Democrats take control of the House or Senate, they would have subpoena and investigative powers. Democrats would head committees throughout Congress and have the authority to look into many of the controversial issues they've railed against since Trump took office, including the president's tax returns.\n\nIDs, voter registration and other tidbits\n\nBefore you head to the polls, there are a few things you should research beforehand.\n\nYou should also make sure to do your homework on the candidates and the issues on the ballot. BallotReady has sample ballots races nationwide so you can see what it will look like and research the issues and candidates.\n\nHere's where we'll be posting all of our elections coverage and monitoring races across the country. USA TODAY also has an in-depth outlook on candidates for Congress and governor races across the nation.\n\nAnother key thing to know is what sort of identification you need to cast a ballot. Thirty-four states have laws requiring a person show some manner of identification before voting. Seven of those, Tennessee, Kansas, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia and Indiana, require a photo ID.\n\nIf you aren't sure whether your state requires any sort of identification, you can check here.\n\nBefore heading to the polls, it's also a good idea to verify your voter registration. Many states clean up their voter rolls to purge inactive voters or those who have moved out of state.\n\nTo make sure you're still registered, you can go to Vote.org.\n\nAlso, be careful when thinking about taking a selfie of you and that ballot. It's illegal to take a photo in an election booth in a number of states, including New York and Illinois.\n\nMore: Want to take 'ballot selfie'? Here's where it's legal, and not\n\nThe Associated Press examined the laws in all 50 states during the 2016 election cycle and found the practice was illegal in more than 15 states.\n\nWhere to vote and when do polls close\n\nWhere and when you cast your ballot depends where you live.\n\nMost polling places open anywhere from 6 to 8 a.m. and close from 6 to 9 p.m. local time. These schedules vary by state but can also differ by county or city.\n\nElections are run differently in each state, but every state has its own website where you should be able to find your polling place, along with when it opens and closes.\n\nAn easy way to check is by going to Vote.org. Just plug in your address and the site will show you the location of your polling place and the times it's open. The website also lists each state's voting website.\n\nGoogle also offers a service for helping to find your polling place.\n\nWhere to find results\n\nResults could come fast or take hours, days or weeks. Each polling station sends in its results to a county administrator. From there, the results go to the state agency charged with verifying results, in many states, it's the Secretary of State.\n\nIf you don't want to find your state agency and look for results there, local news organizations will be monitoring the races in your communities.\n\nShameless plug: You can also check usatoday.com/elections for election results.

Among those was a report from CBS Sports\u2019 Jason La Canfora claiming the Jags were contacted by the New York Jets, who were looking to unload quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to no avail this preseason.\n\nNow, almost a week later, La Canfora has circled around to the report by adding that the Jets were looking to trade Bridgewater for defensive end Dante Fowler Jr. Of course, the Jags turned it down and elected to keep the fourth-year defensive end.\n\nThe Jets offered Bridgewater straight up for linebacker Dante Fowler in the preseason, league sources said, but were quickly rebuffed. Fowler was traded at the deadline last week for two mid-round picks; it was clear around the league that he was out of favor in Jacksonville all the way back in the offseason and not a part of their long-term plans, as the team declined to pick up his fifth-year option. The former third-overall pick was also a part of the locker-room discord in Jacksonville that dated back to training camp, when he was suspended by the team for a week after fighting with a teammate at practice.\n\nAs most are aware, starting quarterback Blake Bortles has struggled mightily, though the Jags have repeatedly asserted their intentions to make him their guy going forward. It appears that stubbornness has costed them dearly as Bortles has not only struggled, but was benched Week 7, and sustained a shoulder injury Week 8. That said, a veteran with a winning record and a good bit of experience like Bridgewater would be clutch at the moment as the Jags will have several questions to be answered heading out of the bye.\n\nLuckily for the fifth-year veteran, he\u2019ll have some help and the opportunity to turn things around as the team added Carlos Hyde and will get Leonard Fournette back before their next game. Additionally, he could have tight end Austin Seferian Jenkins back around the beginning of December to help him right the ship and make a late playoff push.", "Touchdown celebrations are evolving.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Michael Thomas caught a late 72-yard touchdown reception and then celebrated with a cellphone in a throwback to another famous New Orleans play, and the streaking Saints handed the Los Angeles Rams their first loss of the season with a 45-35 win on Sunday.\n\nDrew Brees passed for 346 yards and four touchdowns in New Orleans' seventh straight win, and Thomas finished with a club-record 211 yards receiving. But what happened after their last connection of the day really stole the show in a wild shootout between two of the NFL's best offenses.\n\nThomas' long TD came on a pivotal third-down play with about four minutes to go, when the Rams seemed to expect the Saints to run a play closer to the first-down marker. Thomas ran free behind Marcus Peters, caught Brees' long throw virtually in stride and ran straight to the goal post, where he got out an old-school flip phone \u2014 reminiscent of Joe Horn's Sunday night TD celebration in 2003.\n\nThomas, who caught 12 passes, eclipsed Wes Chandler's club record of 205 yards receiving against Atlanta in 1979.\n\nNew Orleans running back Alvin Kamara scored three times, twice on runs and once on a 16-yard catch-and-run \u2014 all in the first half.\n\nThe Rams (8-1) very nearly pulled off an extraordinary comeback in the Superdome, where the crowd was revved up after New Orleans (7-1) raced to a three-touchdown lead late in the first half.\n\nPATRIOTS 31, PACKERS 17\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass.

On the Patriots next possession, Brady connected with Josh Gordon for a 55-yard TD.\n\nGordon caught four passes for 115 yards.\n\nTEXANS 19, BRONCOS 17\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Brandon McManus missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired, leaving Demaryius Thomas a winner in his homecoming and Houston escaped Denver with a win.\n\nThe Texans (6-3) won their sixth straight and the Broncos (3-6) lost for the sixth time in seven games.\n\nThomas finished with three receptions for 61 yards, but two of them were back-to-back for 31 and 18 yards on the Texans' opening touchdown drive.\n\nMcManus' second miss of the game came after Case Keenum completed an 18-yard pass between two defenders to Emmanuel Sanders on fourth-and-8 from the Denver 45-yard line.\n\nKeenum threw a 5-yard pass to tight end Jeff Heuerman, who had a career-best 10 catches for 83 yards and then running back Phillip Lindsay lost a yard.\n\nAfter Denver called a timeout with 3 seconds left, the Texans did the same, then rushed the field in relief after McManus' kick drifted wide right.\n\nCHARGERS 25, SEAHAWKS 17\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Philip Rivers made his 200th consecutive start and kept Los Angeles surging at the midpoint of the season, surviving a late rally by Seattle's Russell Wilson.\n\nRivers threw for 228 yards and two touchdowns, Melvin Gordon added 113 yards rushing and the Chargers won their fifth straight with a 25-17 win over the Seahawks on Sunday.\n\nRivers threw touchdown passes of 12 yards to Tyrell Williams and 30 yards to Mike Williams, and let the Chargers defense stymie Russell Wilson until the final minutes. Seattle had won four of five following a 0-2 start.\n\nDesmond King provided the deciding points for Los Angeles (6-2) by stepping in front of Wilson's pass for David Moore and returning it 42 yards for a touchdown with 6:44 remaining to give the Chargers a 25-10 lead.\n\nWilson managed to make the final minutes nervous for Los Angeles.\n\nWilson hit Nick Vannett on a 6-yard TD with 1:50 remaining to cut the Chargers' lead to one score. Seattle got the ball back with 1:24 left at its own 22 and after two completions and a roughing the passer penalty on Melvin Ingram, the Seahawks were at the Chargers 44 with 50 seconds left. Wilson scrambled for 16 yards to the Chargers 28 and, after a spike, Seattle had 30 seconds left.\n\nSeattle (4-4) got a break when Michael Davis was called for pass interference in the end zone on the final play of regulation against Tyler Lockett, putting the ball at the 1 for an untimed down. Seattle's J.R. Sweezy was called for false start backing the play up to the 6, and Wilson's final attempt for David Moore in the back of the end zone was partially tipped by Jahleel Addae and fell incomplete.\n\nSTEELERS 23, RAVENS 16\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 James Conner rushed for 107 yards and caught a TD pass for the Steelers (5-2-1), who have won four straight since falling to the Ravens at home on Sept. 30.\n\nRoethlisberger went 28 for 47 for 270 yards. His 1-yard run put Pittsburgh up 20-6 in the third quarter, and the 36-year-old showed his grit by missing only one play after being flattened during a sprint from the pocket with just over 13 minutes left.\n\nThe Ravens (4-5) scored only one touchdown in their third straight defeat. Joe Flacco was limited to 209 yards passing and sacked twice.\n\nPittsburgh opened the second half with a drive that lasted nearly seven minutes and ended with a 1-yard plunge by Roethlisberger. The conversion sailed wide to the right, keeping the score at 20-6.\n\nCHIEFS 37, BROWNS 21\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes passed for 375 yards, threw three touchdown passes \u2014 two to Travis Kelce \u2014 and continued the best start by an NFL quarterback in 68 years as Kansas City's impossible-to-handle offense kept rolling with a win over the Browns, who played their first game since coach Hue Jackson's firing.\n\nKareem Hunt had two scoring runs and one receiving for the Chiefs (8-1), who came in averaging 36.3 points per game with an offense overloaded with weapons for Mahomes.\n\nThe 23-year-old used all of them in winning his first pro matchup against Baker Mayfield and the Browns (2-6-1).\n\nMahomes and Mayfield didn't match their epic college meeting in 2016, when they combined for more than 1,700 yards in offense. But the Chiefs put on another impressive offensive show with 499 total yards, averaging 8.6 per snap.\n\nIn his second season, Mahomes, who made just one start as a rookie, already has 29 TD passes and 3,185 yards, the most by any QB through 10 games since 1950. He has passed for at least 300 yards in eight straight games.\n\nVIKINGS 24, LIONS 9\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Danielle Hunter had 3\u00bd of Minnesota's franchise-record 10 sacks and a fourth-quarter fumble return for a touchdown, making for a miserable afternoon for Matthew Stafford and the Lions.\n\nHunter, the fourth-year defensive end, also was credited with nine tackles and four quarterback hits as the Vikings (5-3-1) limited the Lions to 214 total yards.\n\nThe Lions had a streak of 25 consecutive games with at least 14 points stopped in humbling fashion.\n\nStarting a stretch of three straight NFC North games with a badly needed win before their bye, the Vikings beat the Lions (3-5) at home for the first time in three matchups at U.S. Bank Stadium.\n\nDOLPHINS 13, JETS 6\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Rookie linebacker Jerome Baker intercepted Sam Darnold and scored the only touchdown on a 25-yard return with 11 minutes left, and a resilient defense helped the Dolphins beat the Jets.\n\nDarnold threw four interceptions and took four sacks, and the Jets went 2 for 13 on third down.\n\nThe hobbled Dolphins (5-4) endured another wave of injuries, but their defense was much improved after three consecutive poor games, with the quality of the opposition certainly a factor.\n\nDarnold tried to rally his sputtering team from a 6-3 deficit, but following a punt he took a high snap and made an ill-advised throw to tight end Eric Tomlinson. Baker stepped in front for his first career interception and scored untouched.\n\nT.J. McDonald and Walt Aikens made interceptions to end the Jets' final two possessions.\n\nThe Jets (3-6) lost their third in a row and have scored 33 points during the skid. They've dropped nine of their past 10 road games dating to 2017.\n\nBEARS 41, BILLS 9\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Jordan Howard scored two touchdowns and the Bears' defense had two others in a win over the Bills in what proved to be another comedy of errors for Buffalo and its anemic offense.\n\nEddie Jackson scored on a 65-yard fumble return and Leonard Floyd returned a tipped pass 19 yards for another score some 3 1/2 minutes apart in the second quarter. Howard, set up by Tarik Cohen's 38-yard punt return , then scored on an 18-yard scamper to cap a run in which the Bears scored four touchdowns over a span of 12 minutes, 20 seconds in the second quarter.\n\nThe Bears won their second in a row and improved to 5-3 to match their best start to a season through eight games since 2013. Chicago also matched its win total from last year.\n\nChicago's defense forced four takeaways, and limited the Bills to 264 yards offense despite missing star linebacker Khalil Mack, who missed his second straight game with an injury to his right ankle.\n\nThe Bills continued their bumbling ways in dropping to 2-7. It's Buffalo's worst start since winning one of its first nine games in 2010.\n\nFALCONS 38, REDSKINS 14\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 Julio Jones ended his 12-game touchdown drought, Matt Ryan threw for 350 yards and four scores and the Atlanta Falcons flexed their offensive muscles with a blowout of the Redskins that extended their winning streak to three games.\n\nJones caught seven passes for 121 yards with the biggest coming on a 35-yard screen pass with just under four minutes left that sealed the victory. After Jones twisted away from newest Washington defender Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and into the end zone, a swarm of teammates rushed over from the sideline to celebrate Jones' first touchdown catch since Nov. 26, 2017.\n\nRyan completed 26 of his 38 passes, including touchdown passes of 39 and 10 yards to running back Tevin Coleman and 40 to rookie receiver Calvin Ridley. Coleman ran for 80 yards and Ito Smith had 66 yards and a rushing touchdown to give the Falcons (4-4) the balanced attack they've lacked in an injury-marred season that so far has failed to live up to expectations.\n\nThe NFC East-leading Redskins (5-3) could blame poor tackling, ill-timed penalties and a series of injuries along the offensive line for the end of their three-game winning streak.\n\nPANTHERS 42, BUCCANEERS 28\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Cam Newton completed 19 of 25 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns, Christian McCaffrey racked up 157 yards from scrimmage and scored twice and the Panthers built an early lead and held on to beat the Buccaneers for their 10th straight home win.\n\nNewton threw TD passes of 19 yards to Curtis Samuel and 17 yards to Greg Olsen, the seventh straight game he has thrown for at least two touchdowns. McCaffrey had 17 carries for 79 yards and five catches for 78 yards and turned in the play of the game when he leaped over a defender after a reception in the flat and kept going, turning it into a 32-yard gain.\n\nThe Panthers (6-2) scored touchdowns on five straight possessions during the first half to build a commanding 35-7 lead before the Buccaneers battled back to within a touchdown early in the fourth quarter behind Ryan Fitzpatrick.\n\nFitzpatrick, who started in place of the turnover-prone Jameis Winston for Tampa Bay (3-5), finished with 243 yards passing and four touchdowns \u2014 two each to Adam Humphries and O.J.

(AP) \u2014 Cam Newton can't keep from grinning when he looks around at the playmakers that surround him in the Panthers' locker room.\n\n\"The talent level we have on this team is extremely scary,\" Newton said.\n\nThe Panthers proved that again Sunday.\n\nNewton completed 19 of 25 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns, running back Christian McCaffrey racked up 157 total yards and scored twice and second-year wide receiver Curtis Samuel scored on a 33-yard double reverse and hauled in a 19-yard TD catch midway through the fourth quarter to seal Carolina's 42-28 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.\n\nThe Panthers (6-2) are on a roll midway through the season, scoring 99 points in the last nine quarters.\n\nThey have wide receivers that can run the ball, running backs that can catch, a big body receiver, a third-down receiving specialist, one of the best pass-catching tight ends in the league and, of course, a one-time league MVP at quarterback who can do it all.\n\nThose weapons were all on display in the first half as the Panthers scored touchdowns on five straight possessions to build a 35-7 lead en route to their 10th straight win at home.\n\nEven a little \"Fitzmagic\" wasn't enough for the Buccaneers (3-5).\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick, who started in place of the turnover-prone Jameis Winston, finished with 243 yards passing and four touchdowns \u2014 two each to Adam Humphries and O.J. Howard \u2014 and led the Bucs back to within 35-28 in the fourth quarter before running out of steam.\n\nFitzpatrick threw two costly interceptions \u2014 one on the game's second possession which led to Carolina's first touchdown, and other late in the fourth quarter that sealed the Bucs' fate.\n\n\"We know we have the talent, it's just we can't keep digging ourselves in these holes, especially on the road,\" Fitzpatrick said.\n\nThe deficit \u2014 and Carolina's offensive firepower \u2014 proved too much.\n\nTight end Greg Olsen called the versatility the Panthers now have on offense with players like McCaffrey, Samuel and D.J. Moore is unlike anything he's seen since his arrival in Carolina in 2011.\n\n\"We have guys who are so explosive, so dynamic and so good in the open space,\" Olsen said. \"We can give them balls on handoffs, throw it to them all \u2014 they're very unique in that regard. I don't know what we have had this many guys who are that dynamic with the ball in their hands.\"\n\nThat was evident throughout.\n\nMcCaffrey leaped a defender on a reception in the flat and kept going, racing 32 yards for a first down. Samuel's 33-yard TD on the reverse included the speedster reversing field and running a combined 103 yards , according to NFL's Next Gen Stats. And Olsen, the cagey veteran, hauled in a one-handed catch in the end zone \u2014 his third TD in three weeks.\n\n\"We were playing with momentum and when you're playing like that, we have a lot of juice coming our way so it does make it very fun,\" McCaffrey said.\n\nSaid Newton: \"When it's clicking, it's clicking.\"\n\nBREAKING THE PATTERN\n\nBucs coach Dirk Koetter is eager to find a solution for his team, which seems to be stuck in a repeating pattern.\n\n\"We go out, we get behind, we get killed in the second quarter, then rally like (heck) in the third quarter and then everybody thinks we're back in it and then we fade off at the end,\" Koetter said. \"That's definitely the pattern that we're in.

Matt Ryan completed 26 of 38 passes for 350 yards and four touchdowns, including the 35-yard screen to Jones that set off a team-wide celebration.\n\nEven though losing four of its first five games didn't give Atlanta much to celebrate, putting up 491 yards on Washington has players excited about their current position and what more they can accomplish this season.\n\n\"The start to the season was not what we were looking for, but we're halfway through it, we're 4-4 and we're in the mix,\" said Ryan, who had touchdown passes of 39 and 10 yards to running back Tevin Coleman and a 40-yarder to rookie receiver Calvin Ridley .\n\n\"The good football teams that I've been a part of in my career are the ones that have gotten better as the year's gone along. Halfway through, I think we're a better football team than we were at the start and we've got to keep it trending in that direction.\"\n\nNowhere is that progress more evident than on the ground, where Coleman ran for 80 yards and Ito Smith had 66 yards and a rushing touchdown. The Falcons surpassed 100 yards rushing for the first time since Week 2.\n\n\"The big guys, they put the work in,\" said coach Dan Quinn, whose team didn't punt until midway through the third quarter and converted its first eight third-down opportunities. \"We know we are at our best when both the run game and our pass game are in balance. And today we had that, and the results were there.\"\n\nAtlanta's 30th-ranked defense did its part, too, holding Washington to 35 first-quarter yards and making a crucial stop after Ryan was picked off by Quinton Dunbar \u2014 just the quarterback's third interception this season.\n\nThe NFC East-leading Redskins (5-3) could blame poor tackling, ill-timed penalties and a series of injuries along the offensive line for the end of their three-game winning streak.\n\nAlready without left tackle Trent Williams after surgery to repair his dislocated right thumb, Washington lost left guard Shaun Lauvao to a left knee injury, right guard Brandon Scherff to a left shoulder injury and struggled to stop the Falcons when it mattered.\n\n\"It wasn't the preparation, just the executing,\" Washington safety D.J. Swearinger said. \"Got to be better. Got to be disciplined. Got to be disciplined in our efforts.\"\n\nSwearinger and other players blamed officials for part of the Redskins' disciplinary trouble that added up to 10 penalties for 147 yards.\n\nAdrian Peterson was held to 17 yards on nine carries a week after rushing for 149 yards at the New York Giants. Alex Smith was 30 of 46 for 306 yards, an interception and a touchdown pass to Josh Doctson.\n\nKAZEE'S PICK AND THROW\n\nFalcons safety Damontae Kazee effectively ended any chances of a Redskins comeback when he picked off Smith with about seven minutes left. After the play, Kazee ran toward the corner of the stadium full of Falcons fans and did his best Ryan impression by throwing the ball to the top of the lower deck.\n\nKazee said he was trying to get the ball to his nephew in that corner of the stands and isn't worried about punishment.\n\n\"I get fined every week,\" Kazee said. \"I don't care.\"\n\nSMITH'S RUN\n\nAs inconsequential as Washington's ground game was, Smith had its longest gain of the day on a scramble that helped set up a touchdown. With Peterson blocking for him, the 34-year-old picked up 22 yards before being stopped on a crushing shoulder-to-shoulder hit from Brian Poole at the Atlanta 19.\n\nINJURIES\n\nFalcons: Calvin Ridley was cleared to return after being evaluated for a head injury. ... K Matt Bryant missed his second consecutive game with a right hamstring injury, and CB Robert Alford was out with an ankle injury, the first game he has missed since 2015.\n\nRedskins: Played stretches without three-fifths of their starting offensive line and lost Lauvao to a potentially serious knee injury.

The Bills had no choice but to return to the second-year player with rookie Josh Allen missing his third game with a sprained throwing elbow and Derek Anderson sidelined by a concussion.\n\nPeterman continued playing down to his turnover-prone reputation , though two of the interceptions weren't entirely his fault.\n\nNewly signed receiver Terrelle Pryor caught Peterman's pass and lost control as he turned up field, with the ball landing in defensive back Adrian Amos' hands.\n\nThree snaps into Buffalo's next possession, Peterman's hard pass over the middle struck Jones in the hand and bounced directly to Floyd, who returned it for a touchdown.\n\n\"I don't see anybody who's not trying to give it their all,\" Jones said. \"That's just the most discouraging thing about the whole situation right now is that the effort is there.\"\n\nBut is the talent?\n\nCoach Sean McDermott responded defiantly when asked if the Bills have enough talent on offense to compete.\n\n\"I believe we do,\" he said.\n\nThe Bills have been outscored 157-46 in their past six.\n\nPeterman finished 31 of 49 for 187 yards and the second-year player has now thrown 13 interceptions on 133 career attempts, including playoffs.\n\nChicago's Mitchell Trubisky finished 12 for 20 for 135 yards with a 2-yard touchdown to tight end Trey Burton and an interception.\n\nQUIET McCOY\n\nBills running LeSean McCoy remains stuck in neutral, and didn't stick around to talk about an outing in which he managed just 10 yards rushing on 10 carries, and six days after he had 13 yards on 12 carries in a 26-5 loss to New England.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Going up against the NFL's top-ranked defense, Ben Roethlisberger showed his versatility, grit and ability to bounce back from injury.\n\nHe also proved his own theory: The only unit capable of stopping the Pittsburgh offense is, well, the Pittsburgh offense.\n\nRoethlisberger threw two touchdown passes, ran for a score and put up an unexpected left-footed punt to help the Steelers beat the Baltimore Ravens 23-16 Sunday.\n\nJames Conner rushed for 107 yards and caught a TD pass for the Steelers (5-2-1), who have won four straight since falling to the Ravens at home on Sept. 30.\n\nPittsburgh is averaging 31 points a game during its winning streak. Against Baltimore, the Steelers rolled up 395 yards, converted 10 of 16 third-down plays and held the ball for 36\u00bd minutes.\n\n\"We feel that we can do what we want to do,\" Roethlisberger said. \"We've got roadblocks, which are great defenses on other teams, trying to stop us, but we've always said \u2014 and no disrespect to other teams \u2014 they don't stop us, we stop ourselves.\"\n\nThat didn't happen Sunday. Pittsburgh did not commit a turnover, and Roethlisberger went 28 for 47 for 270 yards. His 1-yard run made it 20-6 in the third quarter, and the 36-year-old showed his determination by missing only one play after being flattened during a sprint from the pocket with just over 13 minutes left.\n\n\"Ben just got the wind knocked out of him,\" coach Mike Tomlin said.\n\nThe Ravens (4-5) scored only one touchdown in their third straight defeat, managing two field goals in the first half while falling behind 14-6. Baltimore had converted 72.4 percent of its red zone opportunities into TDs \u2014 the fourth-best percentage in the NFL \u2014 but on this day a 1-for-4 performance didn't cut it.\n\n\"To hold those guys to field goals in the first half when they were down there was significant,\" Tomlin said.\n\nPittsburgh opened the second half with a drive that lasted nearly seven minutes and ended with a 1-yard plunge by Roethlisberger. The conversion sailed wide to the right, keeping the score at 20-6.\n\nDown by two touchdowns and facing a potential two-game deficit in the AFC North, the Ravens reacted. Joe Flacco completed six passes in a 75-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Alex Collins .\n\nThe defense followed by forcing the game's first three-and-out, but the Baltimore offense failed to sustain the momentum.\n\nAfter the Ravens punted. Roethlisberger was collared from behind by Za'Darius Smith and remained on the ground for several minutes. Joshua Dobbs came in, completed a 22-yard pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster, then gave way to Roethlisberger.\n\n\"That was a huge play,\" Roethlisberger said of Dobbs' first-down toss.\n\nThe drive led to a field goal for a 10-point cushion with 8:26 remaining.\n\nBaltimore got another field goal to get within a touchdown with 5:23 to go, but never threatened thereafter. It was not at all the way the Ravens wanted to enter their long-awaited bye week.\n\n\"We'll go into our bye week trying to get rested up, trying to get healthy,\" coach John Harbaugh said. \"We'll try to come out swinging the last seven games and find a way to make the playoffs.\"\n\nIn the first half, Roethlisberger threw 29 passes and showed his kicking prowess as Pittsburgh took control.\n\nWith the Steelers facing a fourth down from the Baltimore 38, Roethlisberger lined up in shotgun formation and popped up a 27-yard punt \u2014 his seventh career kick.\n\nEric Weddle drifted back to catch the kick and took it back 18 yards, perhaps the only disappointing aspect of Big Ben's day.\n\n\"It would have been good if Weddle didn't go back and catch it,\" Roethlisberger lamented. \"It would have been inside the 5, for sure.\"\n\nThe Ravens then settled for a field goal one play after Flacco failed to see wide-open Lamar Jackson on the right side near the end zone. Jackson, a rookie quarterback who's been used in a variety of ways, went in motion on the play and was left uncovered.\n\nRoethlisberger put Pittsburgh ahead with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Conner, and the Steelers made it 14-3 on a 6-yard TD catch by Antonio Brown.\n\nINJURIES\n\nSteelers: None reported.\n\nRavens: Starting offensive tackles Ronnie Stanley (ankle) and James Hurst (back) were on the inactive list. ... CB Tavon Young hurt his right ankle in the fourth quarter and did not return.\n\nTRIBUTE TO SYNAGOGUE VICTIMS\n\nRoethlisberger wore cleats emblazoned with a Star of David in response to the late-October shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The Star of David was in yellow and served as the upper part of the Steelers logo. There were also the words, \"Stronger Than Hate\" on each shoe.\n\nRoethlisberger and his wife are friends of Michele Rosenthal, a former team employee. Two of Rosenthal's brothers were among the 11 killed in the attack.\n\nMR. TOUCHDOWNS\n\nConner has 10 touchdowns , most by a Steelers player through eight games since 1950.

They're taking care of their business. They're running the routes and making route adjustments on the fly just because they've looked at the film and know how to do those things.\"\n\nMahomes and Mayfield didn't match their epic college meeting in 2016, when they combined for more than 1,700 yards in offense. But the Chiefs put on another impressive offensive show with 499 total yards, averaging 8.6 per snap.\n\nBrowns defensive end Myles Garrett said preparing for Mahomes and Kansas City's air-and-ground show is nothing like playing against it.\n\n\"Their offense has a nice tempo and he gets the ball out of his hand pretty quick, so it's hard to stop,\" he said. \"He spreads the ball around really well and everybody is getting touches. You don't know who it's going to go to next.\"\n\nIn his second season, Mahomes, who made just one start as a rookie, already has 29 TD passes and 3,185 yards, the most by any QB through 10 games since 1950. He has passed for at least 300 yards in eight straight games.\n\n\"It's a weird deal \u2014 he just goes out there and plays,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"He works hard. He loves doing it. He just goes about his business the way that you're supposed to do it.\"\n\nCleveland lost its fourth straight, but it looked better under interim coach Gregg Williams than it did with Jackson, fired on Monday after going 3-36-1 in two-plus seasons.\n\nMayfield threw two TD passes to Duke Johnson and finished 29 of 42 for 297 yards with one interception.\n\nThe Browns came in facing a monumental task in trying to slow Mahomes and an offense with speed, depth and no noticeable weaknesses.\n\nThings got much tougher for Cleveland when starting cornerback Damarious Randall (groin) was scratched and E.J. Gaines (concussion) and rookie Denzel Ward (hip) both got hurt in the first half.\n\nKansas City scored a touchdown on its first three possessions and the Chiefs only had the ball for 11:29 in the first half as the Browns were able to control the clock.\n\nThe Chiefs picked up where they left off in the third quarter with Mahomes firing a 13-yard TD pass to Kelce, giving Kansas City a 28-15 lead.\n\nKelce couldn't stop smiling as he talked about his QB.\n\n\"You mean Showtime Mahomes?\" he said. \"He came in with the understanding this thing could be very special. We added a few pieces to the puzzle and the offensive line is playing lights out. It's a combination of everything that's making him feel comfortable out there.\"\n\nMAYFIELD HEAD SHOT\n\nMayfield was checked for a concussion and cleared after a questionable hit late in the third quarter.\n\nMayfield was backpedaling and being wrapped up by Chris Jones when the rookie QB was struck in the helmet by Chiefs defensive back Ron Parker, who came in late but was not penalized. The NFL's on-site medical spotter called down and Mayfield had to leave the game to be checked for a head injury.\n\n\"I think the rule is if they see me messing with my helmet, they are going to take precaution,\" Mayfield said. \"When you get hit in the head, your helmet moves around so I am going to shift it so it fits correctly. It is just interesting how it works. I had to come out of the game and take the exam.\"\n\nLUCKY STREAK\n\nThe Chiefs won the coin toss for the ninth consecutive week and elected to defer.\n\nHOMETOWN HERO\n\nA Cleveland native, Hunt bought more than 100 tickets for the game and had them given to the players and coaches at his high school alma mater.\n\n\"It's a dream come true that I'm able to do something like that,\" said Hunt, who rushed for 91 yards. \"It's a stadium I used to drive by almost every day.\"\n\nLINE SHIFT\n\nBrowns rookie left tackle Desmond Harrison sat out with an unspecified illness and was replaced by Greg Robinson, a former No. 2 overall pick who made his first start.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nChiefs: Host Arizona on Nov. 11\n\nBrowns: Host Atlanta on Nov. 11.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

For a first-year linebacker, it was a surprisingly polished touchdown celebration.\n\nBaker bested fellow rookie Sam Darnold, scoring the game's only TD on a 25-yard interception return with 11 minutes left, and a resilient defense helped the Miami Dolphins beat the hapless New York Jets 13-6 on Sunday.\n\nDarnold threw four interceptions and took four sacks, and the Jets went 2 for 15 on third and fourth down.\n\nThe hobbled Dolphins (5-4) endured another wave of injuries and the mysterious departure of safety Reshad Jones, who pulled himself out of the game. But their defense was much improved after three consecutive poor games .\n\n\"We never panicked; we knew what our defense was capable of,\" Baker said. \"When we are executing and do our job and play together, we're one of the best defenses out there.\"\n\nThe quality of the opposition helped the defense dominate, however, allowing Miami to win with only seven first downs.\n\nDarnold tried to rally the sputtering Jets (3-6) from a 6-3 deficit, but following a punt the rookie took a high snap and made an ill-advised throw to tight end Eric Tomlinson. Baker stepped in front for his first career interception and scored untouched.\n\n\"I didn't throw it with confidence,\" Darnold said. \"I just alligator-armed it \u2014 threw it a little bit short.\"\n\nMuch of the game was a slog, but Baker provided a video highlight celebrating with his teammates.\n\n\"There is nothing like it,\" he said, game ball cradled under his arm. \"It is the sweetest feeling ever, especially getting in the end zone, seeing your brothers running toward you.\"\n\nT.J.

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Minnesota Vikings turned their defensive line loose on Matthew Stafford in a dominant performance that would have made the old Purple People Eaters proud.\n\nThis unstoppable pass rush was led, predictably, by Danielle Hunter.\n\nHunter had 3 1/2 of Minnesota's franchise-record 10 sacks plus a fourth-quarter fumble return for a touchdown , tormenting Stafford and the Detroit Lions all afternoon in a 24-9 victory by the Vikings on Sunday.\n\n\"We knew he liked to throw the ball down the field, so that's something that really helped us a lot because he held on to the ball,\" said Hunter, who moved into the NFL lead with 11 1/2 sacks for the season. \"So as long as we executed the rush plan, we knew we'd be able to get back there.\"\n\nHunter also was credited with nine tackles and four quarterback hits. The Vikings (5-3-1) limited the Lions (3-5) to a season-low 214 total yards, and their pressure on Stafford was so intense he literally had pieces of rubber pellets from the artificial turf flushed out of his left eye in the second quarter. The Lions had a streak of 25 consecutive games with at least 14 points come to a crashing halt.\n\n\"The fault is on everybody,\" said Stafford, who was sacked a total of 13 times over the first seven games. \"I have to get the ball out faster.\"\n\nAfter Dalvin Cook dropped a pitch from Kirk Cousins and A'Shawn Robinson recovered at the Detroit 28 with Minnesota leading 17-6, the Lions converted a fake punt to keep that drive alive. Two plays later, Stafford ran right on the short side of the field and tried an option-style flip that Kerryon Johnson was unable to secure, and Hunter scooped it up on his way to the easy score.\n\n\"I don't know why he pitched it. He could've just run,\" Hunter said. \"I thought it was a pass all the way, but I guess he didn't want to get hit or something.\"\n\nThat happened a lot, including a total of three times in the second quarter on two separate possessions inside the Minnesota 20 that forced the Lions to settle for field goals by Matt Prater.\n\nAfter a throw by Cousins to Adam Thielen near midfield was intercepted by Darius Slay, the Lions made it as far as the 12-yard line. Hunter sacked Stafford on consecutive snaps, sharing the first one with Everson Griffen.\n\n\"He's a freak of nature. He looks like a superhero,\" Griffen said of the fourth-year defensive end. \"I expected that from him.\"\n\nNine of the 10 sacks by the Vikings came from their front four, including 2 1/2 by backup defensive tackle Tom Johnson. During the heyday of the Purple People Eaters, the Vikings had nine sacks in a game in 1968, 1969 and 1970. They also did it in 1993. But this was the record-setter, thanks to a well-timed mix of blitzes called by coach Mike Zimmer and the relentless rush by Hunter and his friends up front.\n\n\"We know if we give them time, they'll get there,\" safety Harrison Smith said. \"It's fun to be a part of.\"\n\nHE'S COOKIN'\n\nWith one burst through a big hole in the left side of the line , Cook made clear he's healthy again with a 70-yard gain in the second quarter to set up a short touchdown catch by Thielen. According to the NFL's NextGen Stats tracker, he averaged 22.07 mph during that run for the fastest in the league this season. The Lions have allowed a rush of 50-plus yards in four different games this year.\n\nNOT THIELEN IT\n\nThielen's streak of 100-yard receiving games ended at eight in a row, leaving him in a tie for the record with Lions legend Calvin Johnson. The Lions double-covered him often, taking advantage of the absence of fellow standout Stefon Diggs to rib injury, and Thielen finished with only four receptions for 22 yards.\n\nSTACKS OF SACKS\n\nThe previous high sack total for Stafford in his career was seven, against the Vikings in 2015. He has been sacked five times or more on 15 different occasions, six of those by the Vikings. The Lions are 3-12 in those games.\n\n\"It's a big shot to our pride,\" left guard Frank Ragnow said.\n\nUH-OH\n\nThe opening kickoff was ominous for the Lions when Prater slipped after his leg swing, an unintentional squib the Vikings returned to their 35. Practice squad promotion Chad Beebe caught back-to-back passes on the first drive of his NFL debut. The second one netted 13 yards on fourth-and-2 from the Detroit 37. Latavius Murray finished the march with a 1-yard touchdown run.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nLions: DE Ziggy Ansah (shoulder) returned from a six-game absence with had a sack in the closing seconds of the second quarter that forced the Vikings to settle for a field goal. ... LT Taylor Decker left in the third quarter with an undisclosed injury but later returned.\n\nVikings: LB Anthony Barr (hamstring) and LG Tom Compton (knee) were held out for the second straight game, and SS Andrew Sendejo (groin) missed his fourth straight contest. ... Backup TE David Morgan hobbled off in the third quarter with a left knee injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLions: Play at Chicago next Sunday.\n\nVikings: Play at Chicago on Nov. 18, after the bye.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Larry Papke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Kevin Harvick gave the checkered flag to a young fan he brought onto the track to take a selfie \u2014 one with the winning driver and car that will have a shot at another NASCAR Cup championship.\n\nHarvick rocketed past polesitter Ryan Blaney in overtime Sunday, after the third restart in the final 35 laps, to win the Texas fall race for the second year in a row and take one of the four championship-contending spots for the season finale in two weeks.\n\n\"We don't come here to count our fingers and toes to try to figure out how we're going to make it. We want to earn it,\" said Harvick, who led 177 of 337 laps. \"Today we earned our way in and we're going to go and race again next week and try to win another race and see what we can do at Homestead.\"\n\nAfter taking the inside on the first two restarts, and briefly losing the lead after the second one, Harvick opted to start from outside for the green-white-checkered finish. By time they got to the backstretch, Harvick had pushed his No. 4 Stewart-Haas Ford in front of Blaney and raced to his eighth win of this season and 45th overall.\n\n\"I thought if I could keep him from finishing the corner I could drive back by him,\" Harvick said. \"It all worked out.\"\n\nOf Harvick's 32 starts in the Lone Star State, his only two wins are the last two fall races to get into the final four. The 2014 Cup champion has 20 top-10 finishes at the 1 1/2-mile track. He won both stages Sunday, marking the fourth time this year he did that and went on to win the race.\n\nWith Harvick and Martinsville winner Joey Logano in the No. 22 Ford of Team Penske locked in, the series goes to Phoenix next week with only two spots up for grabs for the championship run at Homestead.\n\nKyle Busch, a seven-time winner this year, and defending Cup champion Martin Truex Jr. are among the other six title contenders. They are comfortably above the cut line for points, but Chase Elliott or any of Harvick's three SHR teammates \u2014 Clint Bowyer, Aric Almirola and Kurt Busch \u2014 could advance with a win in Phoenix.\n\nLogano was third at Texas. Elliott was sixth, followed by Kurt Busch and Almirola, who had also gone to the rear at the start of the race for unapproved body modifications. Truex, who was close to clinching a title spot before that bump-and-run by Logano on the final lap to win at Martinsville last week, finished ninth.\n\nKyle Busch was 17th and Bowyer 26th after starting on the front row but making contact with Denny Hamlin on the first lap.\n\nAfter the first of the late restarts, Harvick was on the inside and was able to keep Blaney from clearing him on the backstretch. Harvick was already starting to rebuild his lead \u2014 it had been nearly 4 seconds before the caution \u2014 when another yellow flag came out.\n\nHarvick was on the inside again for the next restart, but Blaney was able to get by him for the lead. Blaney led seven laps before Harvick went under him and was again putting distance between them before Joey Gase's spin brought out the last of eight cautions.\n\n\"They were hard. They were challenging,\" Blaney said about the restarts. \"That was really the only shot we had to beat him, to be honest with you. We got by him one restart and I just couldn't hold him off. ... The last one, he took the top, like I knew he was going to go. He motored around me.\"\n\nTruex had to start at the rear of the field because of an engine change. He also dealt with a loose tire and had a pass-through penalty during the race for driving through too many pit boxes, and was a lap down before getting that back one the first of the late cautions.\n\n\"We got a little bit of luck on our side after that to be able to get back on the lead lap. Happy about that for sure,\" he said. \"To start exactly where we were I think is a decent day. The only difference is there's one less spot available.\"\n\nLOOK OUT LOGANO\n\nTruex has vowed that Logano won't win the Cup title after what happened at Martinsville. Now Almirola is upset with Logano after one of the late restarts in Texas.\n\n\"He just continues to make things harder on himself,\" Almirola said.\n\nAfter working himself back to the front of the field, Almirola said Logano \"about wrecked\" them both after coming down into his door in Turn 3.\n\n\"If that's the way he wants to race me when he's already locked into to Homestead and we're out here fighting for our lives, that's fine,\" Almirola said. \"When Homestead comes around, if I'm not in, he'll know it.\"\n\nLogano said they were still racing at the end in a tight turn.\n\nERROR TO THE BACK, AND A SPIN\n\nJimmie Johnson was sent to the rear of the field after the No. 48 Chevrolet twice failed prerace inspection.\n\nNASCAR later said it erred in penalizing Johnson at the start of the race because his car passed inspection the third time. He had qualified 23rd for his 600th start with Chad Knaus as his crew chief.\n\n\"There is no format for the teams to communicate to the tower. So, whatever the tower says is the way it is,\" Johnson said. \"This is just one of a few calls that have been wrong due to that situation. I don't know how they do it.\"\n\nJohnson's teammate with Hendrick Motorsports, William Byron in the No. 24, was sent to the back of the field after three failed inspections.\n\nJust short of 100 laps into the race, Johnson got loose and wiggled in front of Byron that led to contact and a spin for the No. 24.\n\nUP NEXT: The last race in the third round of the playoffs, Sunday at Phoenix.

(Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nQuestion: It appears Donald Trump has 24-karat gold on the cowlings of his personal 757 aircraft. Do these have any positive or negative affect on performance?\n\n\u2013 Howard Forman, Westminster, California\n\nAnswer: I think 24-karat gold would be too soft to be on an inlet. Reviewing pictures of his 757, the inlet and engine manufacturer\u2019s logo appear to be polished aluminum. The inlets are certified for the engine (Rolls-Royce RB-211) because they are heated to avoid inlet icing and are aluminum.\n\nQ: What are the operational concerns or issues in regards to the B757-200, if any?\n\n\u2013 Paul\n\nA: The B757-200 is a high-performance airliner. It operates well in high altitude airports and is one of Boeing\u2019s best performers. Due to the high-thrust engines, it burns more fuel than other single-aisle airplanes. Operationally, pilots love the airplane.\n\nQ: How dangerous is the wake of the 757?\n\n\u2013 John Abel\n\nA: The wake of a 757 can be very strong. The design of the wing results in more powerful wake vortices than other airplanes of the same weight. Many 757s now have winglets, which reduces the power of the wake vortices somewhat. Pilots following a 757 must remain several miles behind it to remain clear of the vortices. They can be very dangerous to smaller airplanes.\n\nQ: Is the Boeing 757 the only narrow-body aircraft that allows a jetway to use door 2-L? What wide bodies (if any) also use 2-L for boarding?\n\n\u2013 Bob Immel, Springfield, Illinois\n\nA: The B757 frequently uses 2-L door for boarding. This helps expedite the boarding process as passengers can stow their luggage in the forward and aft cabins at the same time. The fuselage length of the B757 made placing the 2-L door in front of the wing possible. While a few other airplanes, such as the A321, have 2-L in front of the wing, it is not usually used for boarding due to the configuration of the cabin. Several wide-body aircraft, including the B767, B777 and B747, use 2-L for boarding.\n\nQ: Is it possible that Boeing could bring back the 757 into production without having to design a whole new airplane? So many airlines now seem to want the 757.\n\n\u2013 Dave, Foxboro, Massachusetts\n\nA: I doubt it. The 757 first flew in February 1982. The improvements in aerodynamics, flight controls and computer technology since then would require a new design.\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\n\nLoading...\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/cox/2018/11/04/trump-campaign-plane-boeings-beloved-757/1841757002/", "CLOSE The Humane Society is backing the bill to give farm animals more living space, but Proposition 12's opponents may surprise you. USA TODAY\n\nChickens huddle in their cages at an egg processing plant at the Dwight Bell Farm in Atwater, Calif., in a 2018 file photo. Under Proposition 12 on California's ballot , egg producers would need to free egg-laying hens from cages by 2022. (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP)\n\n\n\nIf you're a chicken, you could do worse than to live in one of Frank Hilliker's cage-free hen houses.\n\n\"I have chicken Disneyland,\" Hilliker said.\n\nThere are chicken toys hanging from the ceiling of his barns in Lakeside, California, for the hens to peck, and the birds are fed up to eight times a day.\n\nIt might seem like Hilliker has gone too far when it comes to poultry entertainment, but it's really just a business decision. Keeping chickens distracted keeps them from hurting each other and is a key element toward moving toward a cage-free operation.\n\nDepending on the outcome of a ballot proposition Tuesday, many more California egg farms could be joining him in junking their cages, a move that could change the way consumers buy and eat animals across the nation.\n\nProposition 12 would mandate that egg-laying chickens no longer be caged after 2022. It would also require more space for veal calves and pregnant pigs. Such laws could make life cushier for farm animals, while complicating operations for the poultry industry and likely raising costs for consumers.\n\nIf passed, the ballot measure \"is certainly going to be the new bar when it comes to farm-animal protection,\" said Josh Balk, vice president for farm animal protection at the Humane Society of the U.S., which is backing the proposition. \"Proposition 12 updates California law that veal, pork and eggs sold in the state don\u2019t come from farm animals confined in cruel cages.\"\n\nThe proposal is also endorsed by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Sierra Club, the California Democratic Party, the United Farm Workers, and the Center for Food Safety. Proponents say that it will bolster family farms and will help prevent diseases, like salmonella, that can be spread from animals confined in small spaces. It's also in keeping with a movement among businesses. Walmart, for instance, said two years ago that it will transition to selling cage-free eggs by 2025.\n\n10/30/2008 8:46:17 AM -- Valley Center, CA, U.S.A -- Ryan Armstrong (right), president of Armstrong Egg Farms, and Gilberto Delgado load fresh eggs onto a crate at the farm. Armstrong said there is no taste difference in the taste of eggs from cage vs cage-free areas. He said only brown hens are in the cage free areas, because people typically associate brown hens as cage free.-- There is a California ballot measure that would force egg-laying hen owners to give hens much more space, which farmers say would put them out of business and increase food safety risks. ORG XMIT: RB 35391 Animal Law 10/30/2008 (Via MerlinFTP Drop) (Photo: Robert Alan Benson, for USA TODAY)\n\nThe proposition is a follow-up to another animal rights ballot measure that passed handily a decade ago in California that required caged chickens to have enough space to stand up and turn around.\n\nAdvocates and critics alike agree the latest animal rights effort will lead to higher food prices, but opponents say the benefits are dubious. An impartial review by the state Legislative Analyst said it will result in higher costs as farmers pass down to consumers the expense of converting their barns and if shortages arise as some can't meet the deadline.\n\nJust how much prices will go up is in dispute. Balk said it likely will amount to about a penny an egg. Agriculture economist Daniel Sumner, an economist at the University of California, Davis, who has studied the measure said it could add 50 cents to $1 to a carton of eggs. Sumner noted, however, there are a lot of variables when it comes to retail pricing that causes prices to fluctuate.\n\nCage-free eggs, where available, already command a small premium over conventionally grown ones. \"It's like buying organic,\" Sumner said.\n\nThen there is the issue of how much it will improve animals' lives and food safety.\n\nKen Klippen, president of the National Association of Egg Farmers, a trade group opposing the measure, said the proposition is detrimental to food safety because uncaged chickens walk around in excrement on barn floors, making them more susceptible to parasites like roundworms.\n\nThere's also the problem of chicken homicide, or the pecking order, the reason that Hilliker tries to make sure his chickens have toys to keep them occupied. To comply with the California proposition a decade ago, many farmers moved chickens from single cages into cages with a few others so they could more freely move around. But that resulted in deaths, because under poultry social organization, weaker birds are often pecked to death by more dominant ones. While small groups of birds are better than big ones when it comes to maintaining peace, chickens allowed to interact with one another will still kill each other, Klippen said.\n\nOther critics say the cage ban doesn't go far enough. Animal rights group PETA opposes the ballot measure, calling egg production inherently cruel. Proposition 12 only \"codifies the cruelty,\" said PETA spokesman Ben Williamson.\n\nFILE - In this Sept. 28, 2007, file photo, chickens appear at a chicken house near Livingston, Calif. If approved by voters in November, Proposition 12 would set size requirements on the coops and cages used to contain breeding pigs, veal calves and egg-laying hens. It would also require all egg-laying hens to be raised in cage-free conditions by 2022. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File) ORG XMIT: LA940 (Photo: Rich Pedroncelli, AP)\n\nEgg farmer Hilliker is skeptical about the proposition. As a smaller producer \u2013 he has about 35,000 birds compared to millions on big farms \u2013 he said the 2022 deadline to banish cages would put him in a bind to complete the conversion of his hen houses.\n\nUnder the 2008 ballot measure, Hilliker and other chicken farmers didn't have to start taking cages out of their barns, but he said he could see that it would be the next step, so he did it on his own. He is close to completing the renovation of the third of his five hen houses at his ranch in rural San Diego County.\n\nThe conversion \"is costing me an arm and leg\" \u2013 nearly $250,000 a barn, he said. \"I don't have the resources the big guys have,\" and it can be hard to pass through the higher costs to many lower-income customers \"who just want cheap.\"\n\nHe said it isn't entirely clear that his chickens are better off. Keeping them caged indoors protects them from disease, predators and each other.\n\n\"Their brain is the size of a marble. Most of their behavior is instinctive,\" he said. Now free to roam indoors, they do more of the things that normally chickens do, like scratch and cluck a lot.\n\nHe knows one thing, however, about chickens in a cage-free barn.\n\n\"They 'sing' more than in a caged house,\" he said, referring to all the sounds a chicken makes.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/04/elections-2018-farm-animals-could-get-new-rights-california/1839574002/", "None\n\nA candle is placed on a tombstone in a field of graves belonging to WWI soldiers in the main cemetery in Frankfurt, Germany, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018.

Michael Probst, AP", "The Kansas City Chiefs took a gamble this offseason when they traded away veteran quarterback Alex Smith to make way for second-year quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who Kansas City invested a first-round draft pick in at the 2017 NFL Draft.\n\nSmith had been a consistent play manager for the Chiefs, getting them to the postseason and minimizing turnovers along the way. But, it seems that Andy Reid wanted someone who could take the offense to the next level, and Mahomes has done just that so far this season.\n\nEntering today\u2019s game against the Browns, Mahomes already had an MVP-worthy resume with over 2,500 passing yards and 26 touchdown passes. He threw two more touchdowns in the first half today, bringing his season total to 28\u2026 through eight and a half weeks. (Remember, Mahomes still has a whole half to add to his total.)\n\nAnd, if someone still had doubts about whether or not the Chiefs made the right decision to trade away Smith, take a look at this stat.\n\nPatrick Mahomes, in his 9th game, has 28 TD passes.

He\u2019s a solid game manager, but he\u2019s not exactly the guy you would really want to lead a game-winning drive.

There\u2019s no doubt the Chiefs were right to move on to Mahomes. The only question now is whether Andy Reid can finally nab that first Super Bowl title now that he\u2019s got the quarterback he wants.", "FILE - In this July 25, 2017, file photo, former Vancouver Canucks head coach Willie Desjardins speaks at a news conference in Calgary, Alberta. The Los Angeles Kings have fired head coach John Stevens just 13 games into his second season in charge. Desjardins was named the Kings\u2019 interim head coach Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018. (The Canadian Press/Jeff McIntosh via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The struggling Los Angeles Kings fired head coach John Stevens on Sunday just 13 games into his second season in charge.\n\nWillie Desjardins will be the Kings' interim head coach for the rest of the regular season, general manager Rob Blake said.\n\nLos Angeles also fired assistant coach Don Nachbaur and hired former Kings forward Marco Sturm to replace him on Desjardins' staff.\n\nLos Angeles is last in the overall NHL standings after a 4-8-1 start and last in the league with 2.15 goals per game. The Kings have been outscored 45-28, but they had won two of their past three games following a six-game losing streak.\n\n\"I'm looking to get the compete and the passion back,\" Blake said after announcing his second coaching change in 19 months. \"We need our players emotionally involved. It's difficult to win when you're not. We expect Willie to bring that passion and that excitement to this team.\"\n\nThe Kings beat Columbus 4-1 on Saturday in Stevens' final game in charge. Desjardins, the former Vancouver head coach, will lead practice Monday and will debut behind the bench when the Kings host rival Anaheim on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Kings still have a wealth of top-end NHL talent including Hart Trophy finalist Anze Kopitar, Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Drew Doughty and high-scoring forward Jeff Carter alongside newcomer Ilya Kovalchuk. But with goalie Jonathan Quick missing all but four games because of injuries, Los Angeles has stumbled through the past 3\u00bd weeks with its top-heavy roster of well-paid veterans, inconsistent depth players and a patchy defense.\n\n\"You look at training camp and you look at the regular season to where we are now, the expectations have not been met,\" Blake said. \"We have really good players. We have players that can make plays. We expect them to make plays, and we expect them to play with that level of compete, and it hasn't been.\"\n\nStevens took over in 2017 after seven years as an assistant in Los Angeles under Terry Murray and Darryl Sutter. The former Philadelphia Flyers head coach was an assistant on the Kings' Stanley Cup-winning teams in 2012 and 2014.\n\nStevens' promotion was an attempt to create a new mentality for the Kings while maintaining some continuity to Sutter, whose grinding style of hockey won the only two Stanley Cup titles in franchise history. Sutter's coaching and former general manager Dean Lombardi's clever moves won two championships, but also left the Kings with a relatively slow, veteran-laden roster that struggled to compete consistently in the speed-based NHL after 2014.\n\nThe Kings went 45-29-8 in Stevens' debut last season, finishing fourth in the Pacific Division and getting swept by Vegas in the first round of the playoffs. Stevens went 51-39-9 overall in Los Angeles, including four games as the Kings' interim head coach in the 2011-12 season between the tenures of Murray and Sutter.\n\nEverything went wrong quickly for Stevens, although Blake said he saw concerns from training camp onward. After adding Kovalchuk as a free agent last summer, Los Angeles got off to its awful start this fall while playing largely without Quick and forward Dustin Brown, who were both out with injuries for long stretches.\n\nQuick is currently out for several weeks after undergoing knee surgery, leaving inexperienced Jack Campbell as Los Angeles' top goalie. The Los Angeles farm system's inability to produce above-average players in recent years has dramatically thinned the big-league club's depth and competitiveness, but the Kings' top-end talent isn't producing its share either, according to Blake.\n\n\"We have some real good players,\" Blake said. \"We need them playing at a higher level. It's been an issue this season that we haven't had everyone going the right direction. (That's) partly the reason for this change.\"\n\nBlake said he has no long-standing connections with Desjardins, the Canucks' head coach from 2014-17. After Vancouver missed the playoffs in his final two seasons, Desjardins coached the Canadian men's national team to bronze medals at the Pyeongchang Olympics last February.\n\nThe Kings clearly also think highly of Sturm, whose 14-year NHL playing career included 17 games with the Kings. He has been the head coach of the German national team since 2015, leading his nation to a silver medal in Pyeongchang.\n\nThe 40-year-old Sturm will spend one more week coaching Germany in the Deutschland Cup before reporting to Los Angeles. Blake said the Kings chose Sturm because of his \"new generational coaching style\" and his skills in \"player relations.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He doesn't even follow NASCAR closely anymore.\n\n\"Because I'm so invested in it and it's been so close to me, I don't think I can follow without wanting to participate,\" he said. \"It would impossible for me.

His best were runner-up finishes in 2008 and 2011.\n\nHis visit to Texas, only the second time he's been at a NASCAR track during a race weekend the past two seasons, came when he joined IndyCar driver Helio Castroneves for their inductions Saturday into the Texas Motor Speedway Hall of Fame.\n\nEdwards won four Cup races at Texas, matching Bristol as the tracks where he got his most wins.\n\nAs for driving again, Edwards said he has the feeling \"something will come up that will be really, really fun and natural to go do, and I'll drive a little bit more. But definitely I'm not going to sign a three-year contract to go run for a Cup championship.\"\n\nHe misses road courses, and has spoken to some people about doing testing on those. There could be some dirt track or late model racing.\n\nBut NASCAR teams are no longer even calling him.\n\n\"I've had a couple of conversations with people, but none in the last year or so,\" Edwards said. \"I think everyone pretty much understands that I'm not really interested in coming back and doing anything too serious right now.

Control of Congress is on the line as is the fate of Donald Trump's presidency. (Nov. 1) AP\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., July 26, 2018. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 If Democrats have been a thorn in President Donald Trump\u2019s side while in the minority, just wait.\n\nSome of his sharpest critics are among those in line to lead committees if Democrats win majority control of the House. They would have the power to issue subpoenas, call hearings and generally make Trump\u2019s life miserable.\n\nImagine the 3 a.m. tweets from Trump if Democrats use that power to probe whether he has financial ties to Russia and financial conflicts of interest or to subpoena the tax returns he\u2019s been reluctant to disclose. All of that would come on top of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDemocrats have campaigned on lowering the cost of health care and prescription drugs, infrastructure improvements and cleaning up corruption in Washington. Their oversight agenda isn\u2019t set, but those campaign promises are likely to inform it.\n\n\u201cOur challenge will be to overcome the Trump administration\u2019s stonewalling and to keep the focus on the answers that the American people are owed from their government,\u201d said Ashley Etienne, spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nRepublicans are worried. House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s political operation sent out a flyer, obtained by USA TODAY, to donors and industry leaders listing the Democrats they believed would be in leadership and the top committee slots.\n\n\"Don\u2019t let this happen, support Team Ryan today!\" the flyer read.\n\nStill, Democrats shouldn\u2019t start an oversight effort saying, \"Now we\u2019re going after President Trump,\" said former Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from 2007 to 2009. That would be \"politicized\" and \"not credible.\"\n\nBut they could look into, for example, whether the Trump administration has turned its back on protecting people\u2019s health or the environment or trying to make the tax code fair, he said.\n\n\u201cI think that there are many legitimate oversight issues, and I think if those issues are reviewed in an honest and fair way, this administration\u2019s going to be embarrassed, because they haven\u2019t done the job they should have been doing,\u201d he said.\n\nHere are some House members who would be poised to lead oversight efforts.\n\nMore: Midterms: Races for governor, statehouses will help decide control of Congress for a decade\n\nMore: 2018 midterms: Racial justice motivating factor for young voters of color, poll finds\n\nNancy Pelosi of California\n\nIf Pelosi regains her former title of House speaker, she\u2019ll play a leading role in shaping the narrative and scope of oversight efforts.\n\nCentrist Democrats will likely want to pursue a cautious approach, while some progressives will want aggressive oversight of the administration.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake \u2013 whoever next becomes speaker, whether they are a Democrat or a Republican \u2013 needs to provide complete oversight of this reckless, criminal administration starting on day one,\u201d Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist who has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nDuring a recent forum at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics, Pelosi said the calls for Trump's impeachment were \"very divisive.\" But she said Democrats would make sure the Mueller investigation\u2019s documentation is preserved for further examination of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nPelosi blasted Republicans during the forum for providing \"absolutely no oversight\" of government agencies. She has already convened meetings with members in line to chair committees to talk with them about their approach and coordination.\n\n\"This shouldn\u2019t be scattershot,\" she said. \"This should be responsible, honoring our Constitution and our responsibilities, seeking the truth and, in terms of the agencies of government, having the proper oversight to make sure that we are exercising our balance of power.\"\n\nElijah Cummings of Maryland\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., May 17, 2017. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP)\n\nWhile Cummings was often critical of Trump over the course of the 2016 election \u2013 the congressman at one point called Trump \"dangerous\" \u2013 the two still met for an hour in the Oval Office in March 2017 to discuss a proposal to lower prescription drug prices.\n\n\"Great discussion,\" Trump tweeted after the meeting. (He later said that Cummings proclaimed he'd be one of the country's \"great presidents,\" something Cummings denied.)\n\nCummings said he got \"radio silence\" from Trump after that meeting, thus ending that brief brush with bipartisanship.\n\nIf Cummings chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, he would have jurisdiction over a broad array of topics. The rising costs of drug prices, along with other everyday issues confronting Americans, would be one part of his mission. Another would focus on waste, fraud and abuse in the Trump administration, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nThat could include oversight on topics such Trump\u2019s potential financial conflicts of interest and protecting against violations of the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments clause,\" which prohibits officeholders from accepting payments from foreign governments without consent from Congress. Potential violation examples could include foreign government officials who buy up floors of Trump's hotel rooms or pay higher-than-market rents at Trump Tower, according to committee Democrats.\n\nOther topics could include the handling of security clearances, attacks on government watchdogs and employees, ethics scandals involving senior administration officials and Trump\u2019s immigration and child separation policies at the southern border.\n\nAdam Schiff of California\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, arrives at a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., July 18, 2018.

(Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nNadler could chair the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over articles of impeachment.\n\nSo far, he has been guarded about his position, telling The Atlantic in September that he hasn\u2019t seen information that\u2019s \u201cproof positive that he\u2019s committed impeachable offenses.\u201d\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s clear Nadler would pursue a vigorous oversight agenda. A report by the committee\u2019s Democratic staff called \u201cA Record of Abuse, Corruption, and Inaction,\u201d blasts the GOP majority for failing to conduct meaningful oversight on a host of issues, including election security, enforcement of federal ethics rules, breaches of the emoluments clause of the Constitution and allegations of obstruction of justice.\n\nHe told The New York Times last month that, if Democrats win control, the committee would open an investigation related to allegations of sexual misconduct and perjury against Justice Brett Kavanaugh, arguing the Senate failed to do its job of \u201cadvise and consent.\u201d He said the committee would likely subpoena records from the White House and FBI, which conducted an investigation into the allegations that Democrats said wasn't thorough enough.\n\nNadler has also been a critic of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, another topic that falls under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cThe abuses and ethical lapses we have seen in the Trump Administration, in the Trump Campaign and in Congress clearly show the need to address the culture of corruption that has developed in the absence of appropriate checks on power,\u201d Nadler said, delivering the weekly Democratic Address last month. \u201cThis corruption is at the heart of what Donald Trump represents: self-interest and ego-driven decisions that come at the expense of the American people.\u201d\n\nMaxine Waters of California\n\nHouse Financial Services Committee ranking member Rep.

She blamed Trump for promoting violence among his supporters and urged others to not be intimidated.\n\n\"We have to keep to doing what we\u2019re doing in order to make this country right,\u201d she said in an interview with Blavity. \u201cThat\u2019s what I intend to do, and as the young people say, 'I ain\u2019t scared.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf Democrats win the House, Waters would be in line to lead the House Financial Services Committee. That means more power to explore a key interest \u2013 Trump\u2019s finances.\n\nShe has been seeking records that could show whether Trump, his family members and associates have financial ties to Russia.\n\nShe would also be in position to review Republican efforts to roll back Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform protections.\n\n\"Financial services issues are critical for all Americans and for our economy, and I am focused on making sure that our financial system is fair,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nWaters, who has long called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, made waves this summer when she encouraged protesters to confront Cabinet officials in public. Trump responded by calling her \u201can extraordinarily low-IQ person\u201d and alleging falsely that she called for harming his supporters.\n\nMore: Forget the pantsuit.

Four losses later, Jacksonville headed into its bye reeling and its only hope for a turnaround was Leonard Fournette returning and lifting the offense out of the funk its been in since defenses figured out how to shut down the simple passing game the coaching staff has put together for Blake Bortles.\n\nBut, over the weekend, the Cardinals provided the Jags with a new hope.\n\nArizona released veteran QB Sam Bradford, who had been benched in September for rookie Josh Rosen. If he makes it through waivers \u2014 any team that claims him would have to pay him $2.3 million for this season \u2014 Bradford will be free to sign with the team of his choice.\n\nYou have to figure the Jaguars will be interested in signing Bradford. Even if Fournette returns and helps turn around the running game, there\u2019s only so much a one-dimensional running back can do for an offense and the unit\u2019s biggest problem remains the quarterback position. If the team is going to make it back to the postseason, a change has to be made at quarterback.\n\nBradford is no franchise quarterback, and it appears injuries have prematurely brought an end to his prime; but, at the very least, the 2010 first-overall pick still has a good arm and is capable of making any throw a coaching staff draws up.\n\nSam Bradford still has a good arm. And he's accurate. Problem is he can't move. Like at all. pic.twitter.com/8pafVwdZMv \u2014 Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) November 4, 2018\n\nThe same cannot be said of Bortles, who has yet to figure out how to throw a spiral. Not only does the Jaguars quarterback struggle to diagnose defenses, but even when he is able to figure out what coverage he\u2019s looking at it, his woeful mechanics prevent him from getting the ball to his intended target on a consistent basis.\n\n$54 million spiral by Blake Bortles here pic.twitter.com/XQx6JHEX2v \u2014 Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) October 23, 2018\n\nAs a result, Jaguars offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett has been forced to call plays with one hand tied behind his back. The Jaguars passing game isn\u2019t very diverse. You\u2019ll see drag routes, fades, screen passes and \u2026 well, little else.\n\nBringing in Bradford would allow Hackett to open up the passing game. He\u2019ll be able to call plays knowing his quarterback can make all the reads and all the throws. That will force defenses to prepare for more than a handful of concepts, which will make things easier on the entire offense, including a young, talented receiving corps. That, combined with the return of Fournette, should allow the offense to play at a league-average clip, which is really all the Jaguars defense needs to carry the team in the AFC South race.\n\nBradford isn\u2019t the athlete Bortles is, which would be the one concern. Bortles scrambles have been the offense\u2019s only weapon during this losing streak, and Bradford isn\u2019t creating anything with his legs. Even in his prime, he wasn\u2019t a good mover. Knee injuries have sapped him of any ability to run the ball. In three games in 2018, Bradford scrambled exactly once, and he\u2019s looked rigid when forced to move in the pocket.\n\nBased on the tape he produced in Arizona, the best comparison for Bradford is probably Eli Manning circa 2014 \u2014 but a tad more accurate. Nobody outside of New York is clamoring to pay a premium for that level of quarterback play, but getting it for the veteran minimum has to be considered a bargain.\n\nMaybe Tom Coughlin \u2014 who seems to be a fan of immobile, big-armed quarterbacks \u2014 will see shades of his old quarterback in Bradford\u2019s tape and finally bring in some real competition for Bortles, who has only had to fend off Chad Henne and Cody Kessler to keep his job. If he doesn\u2019t, nothing will change for the Jaguars this season.", "Manchester City's Leroy Sane, left, duels for the ball with Southampton's Cedric Soares during the English Premier League soccer match between Manchester City and Southampton at Etihad stadium in Manchester, England, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018. (AP Photo/Rui Vieira) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Manchester City displayed ruthless efficiency on Sunday to raise more questions over who can stop Pep Guardiola's team powering to a second straight English Premier League crown.\n\nRaheem Sterling scored twice and goal-poacher Sergio Aguero was also on target as City marched back to the top of the standings with a 6-1 victory against Southampton at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nGuardiola's players punished almost every mistake made in the opening stages by a beleaguered Southampton side as they led 3-0 after just 18 minutes.\n\nThe visitors pulled one back with a penalty but it proved a minor setback for City, which again dominated Southampton in the second half.\n\n\"I thought it was a great team performance,\" Sterling said. \"We were brilliant at times today. It is great times at the moment.\"\n\nIn Sunday's other game, second-place Chelsea breezed past Crystal Palace 3-1 at Stamford Bridge.\n\nCITY SLICKERS\n\nCity needed only five minutes to take the lead against Southampton, Wesley Hoedt putting through his own net following a neat move involving Aguero, David Silva and Leroy Sane.\n\nSterling then quickly laid on the second as Aguero became the ninth player to reach the landmark of 150 Premier League goals.\n\nIt was proving a nightmare return for Southampton manager Mark Hughes, who was in charge at City between 2008-09, as his side conceded a third goal when Sterling supplied a cross and David Silva lashed the ball home.\n\nSouthampton, without a win in six league games, replied in the 29th when Danny Ings was brought down in the box and picked himself up to stroke the penalty past goalkeeper Ederson.\n\nBut City restored its three-goal cushion on the stroke of halftime with Aguero taking advantage of a mistake by Cedric Soares and crossing for Sterling to get his fifth league goal of the season.\n\nSterling added his second of the game midway through the second half before Sane completed the rout in stoppage time.\n\n\"We played excellently without, and especially with, the ball,\" Guardiola said. \"We were aggressive in the final third, but we were lucky to score the goal in the last minute of the first half. The game was not over. Southampton created more chances than most teams this season.\"\n\nMORATA MAGIC\n\nAlvaro Morata continued his recent resurgence with two goals and fellow Spaniard Pedro added a third as Chelsea proved too strong for Roy Hodgson's Palace.\n\nUnbeaten Chelsea made a slow start but Morata cheered the Stamford Bridge crowd by putting his side in front from close range in the 32nd after pouncing on a cross by Pedro.\n\nPalace, beaten in its previous five league matches, leveled early in the second half when James McArthur sent Andros Townsend racing clear and he slammed a ferocious right-foot shot into the net.\n\nChelsea reacted by bringing on dangerman Eden Hazard and Mateo Kovacic for Willian and Ross Barkley, and within minutes the home team was back in front.\n\nHazard took a free kick on the right and the ball eluded several players in the penalty box before reaching the unmarked Morata at the back post, and he struck his fourth goal in his last four league games.\n\nPedro added the third goal from a left-wing cross by another Spaniard, Marcos Alonso, in the 72nd as Chelsea moved on to the same points tally as Liverpool, two behind City.\n\n\"We were a little bit in trouble, so we needed some quality and personality,\" Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri said of his decision to bring on Hazard as a substitute. \"We were lucky because we had Eden on the bench. He was able to immediately change the match.\n\n\"In the first 15 minutes of the second half we were not compact. In the defensive phase we need to improve. When we can't cover the ball in the opponent's half we are in trouble.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP English soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/PremierLeague and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 An Air Force falcon injured at West Point during a prank Saturday before the annual rivalry football game between the service academies is back home and showing signs of improvement.\n\nThe 22-year-old bird named Aurora \"was able to fly around in her pen\" on Sunday, said Air Force Academy spokesperson Lt. Col. Tracy A. Bunko.\n\nThe development is \"an extremely good sign,\" Bunko said, adding that the academy is \"grateful for the outpouring of support and optimistic for Aurora's recovery.\"\n\nThe falcon will continue to be evaluated and will get antibiotics to prevent infection, Bunko said.\n\nArmy officials at West Point apologized Sunday for the injuries to the falcon and promised a full investigation.\n\n\"We are taking this situation very seriously, and this occurrence does not reflect the Army or USMA core values of dignity and respect,\" the academy said in a statement.\n\nSam Dollar, Air Force's falconry team adviser, told The New York Times on Sunday that two West Point cadets took the birds, threw sweaters over them and stuffed them into dog crates. Dollar said the cadets turned over the birds Saturday morning, with Aurora's wings bloodied \u2014 likely from thrashing inside the crate.\n\n\"I think they had them for a couple hours and then they realized it was a bad mistake,\" Dollar told the newspaper. \"When Aurora started thrashing around in the crate, they decided that wasn't a good thing.\"\n\nAurora is the Air Force Academy's official and oldest mascot. On the school's falconry page, the bird is described as a white phase gyrfalcon, which is a \"falcon species that is extremely rare in the wild and whose beauty will take your breath away.\"\n\n\"Unless you are federally licensed, you can't even touch them,\" Dollar said, adding the Air Force cadets who work with the birds spend two months in training and are tested before they can handle them.\n\nThree percent of all falcons are gyrfalcons, and 1 percent of those are white, according to the website. The school acquired Aurora 22 years ago as a gift from the association of graduates.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Four losses later, Jacksonville headed into its bye reeling and its only hope for a turnaround was Leonard Fournette returning and lifting the offense out of the funk its been in since defenses figured out how to shut down the simple passing game the coaching staff has put together for Blake Bortles.\n\nBut, over the weekend, the Cardinals provided the Jags with a new hope.\n\nArizona released veteran QB Sam Bradford, who had been benched in September for rookie Josh Rosen. If he makes it through waivers \u2014 any team that claims him would have to pay him $2.3 million for this season \u2014 Bradford will be free to sign with the team of his choice.\n\nYou have to figure the Jaguars will be interested in signing Bradford. Even if Fournette returns and helps turn around the running game, there\u2019s only so much a one-dimensional running back can do for an offense and the unit\u2019s biggest problem remains the quarterback position. If the team is going to make it back to the postseason, a change has to be made at quarterback.\n\nBradford is no franchise quarterback, and it appears injuries have prematurely brought an end to his prime; but, at the very least, the 2010 first-overall pick still has a good arm and is capable of making any throw a coaching staff draws up.\n\nSam Bradford still has a good arm. And he's accurate. Problem is he can't move. Like at all. pic.twitter.com/8pafVwdZMv \u2014 Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) November 4, 2018\n\nThe same cannot be said of Bortles, who has yet to figure out how to throw a spiral. Not only does the Jaguars quarterback struggle to diagnose defenses, but even when he is able to figure out what coverage he\u2019s looking at it, his woeful mechanics prevent him from getting the ball to his intended target on a consistent basis.\n\n$54 million spiral by Blake Bortles here pic.twitter.com/XQx6JHEX2v \u2014 Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) October 23, 2018\n\nAs a result, Jaguars offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett has been forced to call plays with one hand tied behind his back. The Jaguars passing game isn\u2019t very diverse. You\u2019ll see drag routes, fades, screen passes and \u2026 well, little else.\n\nBringing in Bradford would allow Hackett to open up the passing game. He\u2019ll be able to call plays knowing his quarterback can make all the reads and all the throws. That will force defenses to prepare for more than a handful of concepts, which will make things easier on the entire offense, including a young, talented receiving corps. That, combined with the return of Fournette, should allow the offense to play at a league-average clip, which is really all the Jaguars defense needs to carry the team in the AFC South race.\n\nBradford isn\u2019t the athlete Bortles is, which would be the one concern. Bortles scrambles have been the offense\u2019s only weapon during this losing streak, and Bradford isn\u2019t creating anything with his legs. Even in his prime, he wasn\u2019t a good mover. Knee injuries have sapped him of any ability to run the ball. In three games in 2018, Bradford scrambled exactly once, and he\u2019s looked rigid when forced to move in the pocket.\n\nBased on the tape he produced in Arizona, the best comparison for Bradford is probably Eli Manning circa 2014 \u2014 but a tad more accurate. Nobody outside of New York is clamoring to pay a premium for that level of quarterback play, but getting it for the veteran minimum has to be considered a bargain.\n\nMaybe Tom Coughlin \u2014 who seems to be a fan of immobile, big-armed quarterbacks \u2014 will see shades of his old quarterback in Bradford\u2019s tape and finally bring in some real competition for Bortles, who has only had to fend off Chad Henne and Cody Kessler to keep his job. If he doesn\u2019t, nothing will change for the Jaguars this season.", "bad url", "The Los Angeles Rams landed Dante Fowler Jr. at the trade deadline, sending the Jacksonville Jaguars two draft picks in return. However, he was hardly the only pass rusher they tried to acquire this season.\n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, the Rams also made a push to trade for Jadeveon Clowney of the Texans, only to be denied. Those inquiries were made in the first few weeks of the season.\n\nRams are going for it: In recent months, they inquired about Khalil Mack, Jadeveon Clowney and Jerry Hughes before completing Dante Fowler Jr. trade.https://t.co/HMsQ814lmk \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) November 4, 2018\n\nIn addition to Clowney, the Rams also called the Bills multiple times about veteran Jerry Hughes. Buffalo rebuffed all of the Rams\u2019 offers, of course, and held onto Hughes through the trade deadline.\n\nLike Fowler, Clowney will also be a free agent after this season. However, unlike Fowler, Clowney is going to command a massive contract extension in the offseason. He\u2019s looking to be one of the highest-paid pass rushers in the league, which the Rams may not have been willing to make him.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have the cap space, but with so many large contracts already on the books, paying Clowney after Aaron Donald would\u2019ve been difficult. At least Fowler should be within their price range.\n\nHughes would\u2019ve been cheaper for the Rams, both in terms of salary and compensation, but he\u2019s also 30 years old and not a long-term option.", "CLOSE Democrats have midterms momentum, but remember 2016 and don't get comfortable, says columnist Paul Brandus. USA TODAY\n\nPeople vote at outdoor booths during early voting for the mid-term elections in Pasadena, California on Nov. 3, 2018. (Photo: Mark Ralston, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe data from the final polls on the 2018 election are rolling in, two days before ballots are cast in one of the most divisive and closely watched midterms in recent memory.\n\nOverall, the numbers point to the same likely outcome that polls have indicated for months: that despite a strong economy with Republicans in control of Capitol Hill and the White House, Democrats are favored on generic ballots. But the Democratic lead in a generic race has tightened over a few months ago.\n\nOn Monday, CNN published a poll that found likely voters prefer a generic Democratic candidate by a 13-point margin, 55 percent to 42 percent. And that poll found just 39 percent of respondents approve of President Donald Trump's performance in office.\n\nGallup's poll on Monday found Trump's approval rating at 40 percent.\n\nBut in another poll on Monday, Rasmussen Reports, which is consistently a conservative-leaning outlier among polling outfits, found that 46 percent of respondents said they would vote for the Republican congressional candidate if the election were held today, while 45 percent said they would go with the Democrat.\n\nRasmussen put Trump's approval rating at 50 percent and his disapproval at 49 percent.\n\nA poll from ABC News and The Washington Post released Sunday found 52 percent would choose a generic Democrat over a generic Republican for Congress, while 44 percent would choose the Republican.\n\nAn NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found a similar result, with 50 percent of likely voters favoring a Democratically controlled Congress and 43 percent favoring a Republican one. Among all registered voters, the race tightens further, to a 6-point lead for Democrats.\n\nAs always, the election result will depend on voter turnout and both polls found high enthusiasm and interest in the election among voters.\n\nEighty percent told the ABC/Washington Post pollsters they are \"certain to vote\" or had already voted, up from 65 percent in the 2014 midterm. Among registered voters, the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found 70 percent are very interested in the election (rating their interest a nine or 10 on a scale from one to 10), up from a consistent 61 percent in the past three midterm elections.\n\nThe closing numbers reflect a steady improvement for Republicans from the end of 2017, when the RealClearPolitics polling average had Trump's party trailing Democrats by 13 points on a generic congressional ballot. Now, the average Democratic lead has been cut to 7 points.\n\n\"It has closed. It is a more competitive race,\" Republican pollster Bill McInturff told NBC News. \"But for Republicans, it feels slightly short of where you\u2019d want to be for a national election.\"\n\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll found that Democrats had dropped sharply among demographic groups they are counting on for support. While the last two of their polls found women favoring Democrats by margins of more than 20 percent, that lead has dropped to 14 points in the most recent survey. And the poll found a huge slide in support for Democrats among independent female voters, from a 33-point edge in October to a two-point lead now.\n\nThe Republican edge among white men without a college education increased from 27 points in October to 39 points.\n\nThe data indicates that voters feel better about the state of the country and the economy than they did in 2017. At the end of last year, only 29 percent of respondents to the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll said the country was headed in the right direction. That number has climbed to 38 percent, above the 37 percent when Trump took office and the 32 percent at this point in the Obama administration.\n\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll found that 65 percent had a positive view of the economy, up from 51 percent just prior to Trump's inauguration. That the highest level for the poll since reaching a mark of 70 percent in January 2001.\n\nTrump's approval rating was at 46 percent in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll with 52 percent of respondents expressing disapproval. Former President Barack Obama was at 47 percent approval and 47 percent disapproval in the same poll at this point in his presidency. Although the president is not on the ballot, 31 percent said they plan to cast their vote to signal support for Trump, while 38 percent their vote will be cast to signal their opposition.\n\nThe ABC/Washington Post was not quite as positive for Trump. Only 40 percent of respondents to that poll gave Trump's job performance a thumbs up, while 53 percent said they disapproved.\n\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll was conducted from Oct. 29 to Nov. 1 with a margin of error of +/-3 percent. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted Nov. 1-3 with a margin of error of +/-3.1 percent for registered voters and +/-3.53 percent for likely voters.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/04/midterm-elections-final-polls/1884468002/", "ESPN\u2019s Sunday NFL Countdown took a rare foray out of the studio Sunday to set up in New Orleans ahead of much anticipated Rams-Saints game.\n\nBut a veteran of the roving, crowd-driven setup showed up to offer support \u2014 and go through his usual schtick.\n\nLee Corso's first-ever NFL headgear selection just now on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown.

(AP Photo/Bill Feig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe Latest on Week 9 in the NFL (all times EST):\n\n7:49 p.m.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams' undefeated run is over.\n\nDrew Brees threw four touchdown passes and Michael Thomas had 12 receptions for 211 yards and a score in a 45-35 win for the New Orleans Saints over the previously unbeaten Rams.\n\nNew Orleans led 35-14 late in the second quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, the Rams rallied to tie it with 21 straight points.\n\nThe Saints, though, made enough plays on both sides of the ball to pull away again for the victory.\n\n___\n\n7:38 p.m.\n\nDeshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes, helping the Houston Texans beat the Denver Broncos 19-17.\n\nThe Texans have won six in a row after opening with three losses. They joined the 1970 New York Giants as the only NFL teams to pull off that feat since 1970.\n\nPhilip Rivers also had two touchdown passes in a win, lifting the Los Angeles Chargers to a 25-17 win over the Seattle Seahawks. Rivers started his 200th straight game in the regular season, a milestone reached by just three other NFL quarterbacks: Brett Favre, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning.\n\n___\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints have built another double-digit cushion against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nDrew Brees' 72-yard touchdown pass to Michael Thomas converted a third down and helped New Orleans take a 45-35 lead with 3:52 left to play. New Orleans led the Rams 35-14 late in the first half, then gave up 21 straight points, before taking the lead back to put them on the brink of their first loss.\n\n___\n\n7:03 p.m.\n\nMalcolm Brown should get credit from the judges for degree of difficulty .\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams running back scored in spectacular fashion in the third quarter on an 18-yard catch, helping his undefeated team rally at New Orleans.\n\nBrown hurdled Saints safety Marcus Williams when he tried to take his legs out inside the 10. Brown landed on his right foot and then got his left foot down as he twisted near the sideline before lunging to get the ball over the goal line.\n\nThe Rams pulled into a 35-all tie early with 9:58 left to play after trailing by 21 points late in the second quarter.\n\n___\n\n6:14 p.m.\n\nDrew Brees and the New Orleans Saints have the Los Angeles Rams on the brink of defeat.\n\nThe Saints led the undefeated Rams 35-17 at halftime.\n\nBrees had a lot to do with that. He was 17 of 22 for 211 yards with three touchdowns, to three different teammates, over the first two quarters.\n\nTodd Gurley scored in his 12th straight game for the Rams, breaking a franchise record he shared with Hall of Famer Elroy Hirsch.\n\n___\n\n5:55 p.m.\n\nSeattle took some choreographed steps toward having the best touchdown celebrations in the NFL.\n\nRussell Wilson threw a 10-yard scoring pass to Jaron Brown midway through the first quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, sparking the Seahawks' latest display of creativity. Brown lined up behind three teammates in the end zone. Two of them slid to the left and two slid to the right, parting the way for Brown to finish off the fun with some dance moves.\n\nIn last week's win at Detroit, the Seahawks acted out a baseball scene in the end zone.\n\n___\n\n5:32 p.m.\n\nDeshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes in the first half at Denver, giving him 36 career touchdown passes and putting him in company with two Hall of Famers.\n\nThe Houston Texans quarterback threw 19 passes in seven games as a rookie in 2017 and is nearing that total in his second season through nine games.\n\nDan Marino and Kurt Warner are the only other players in NFL history to throw at least 35 touchdown passes over the first 16 games of their career.\n\n___\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nPhilip Rivers is starting in his 200th consecutive game, a milestone just three NFL quarterbacks have ever reached.\n\nRivers took the first snap for the Los Angeles Chargers against Seattle to join Brett Favre, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning as the quarterbacks in league history to start at least 200 games. Favre started an NFL-record 297 straight times in the regular season.\n\n___\n\n4:40 p.m.\n\nHouston didn't waste time getting Demaryius Thomas the ball in his Texans debut against his old team.\n\nThe standout receiver turned a screen pass into a 31-yard gain on Houston's fourth play of the game and he had an 18-yard reception on the next snap against the Denver Broncos.\n\nHis two catches for 49 yards set up a touchdown pass to Jordan Thomas.\n\n___\n\n4:14 p.m.\n\nJulio Jones' touchdown drought is done.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons wide receiver caught a 35-yard scoring pass from Matt Ryan in the fourth quarter against the Washington Redskins, dragging safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix on the way into the end zone. His score helped Atlanta beat Washington 38-14\n\nIt was Jones' first touchdown since Nov. 26, 2017. He had played in 12 games since his previous score.\n\n___\n\n4:04 p.m.\n\nThe Washington Redskins' banged-up offensive line got a break with the return of Morgan Moses against Atlanta. Or, maybe not. The right tackle returned in the second quarter after limping off the field in the first. Moses was then called for holding, negating a 28-yard gain that would have put Washington in position to attempt a field goal.\n\nWashington lost left guard Shawn Lauvao to an injured left knee on its first drive against the Falcons. The Redskins started the game without Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams after he had surgery on his right thumb. Lauvao was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair.\n\nAtlanta was leading 38-14 late in the game.\n\n___\n\n3:50 p.m.\n\nPittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger seemed to survive a scare.\n\nRoethlisberger went down after landing hard on the field after a sprint from the pocket, but was able to return after being out briefly. He was tackled from behind by Baltimore's Za'Darius Smith and remained prone for a lengthy stretch of time. It appeared he landed hard on his shoulder, but appeared OK after being helped off the field.\n\nThe play occurred early in the fourth quarter with Pittsburgh leading the Ravens 20-13. Josh Dobbs came in to play quarterback for one play before Big Ben returned. Not long after that, Roethlisberger completed a 51-yard pass to Jesse James.\n\n___\n\n3:40 p.m.\n\nThe Denver Broncos are going to honor former receiver Demaryius Thomas with a video tribute before their game with Thomas' new team, the Houston Texans.\n\nThomas returned to Denver five days after his trade to Houston.\n\nThe Broncos also put a \"Thank you, D.T.\" message on the 10-story high poster of Thomas that graces the south side of Mile High Stadium.\n\nThe message was right above the tunnel where the Texans' buses pulled into the stadium.\n\n\u2014Arnie Stapleton reporting from Denver.\n\n___\n\n3:05 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is lighting up the scoreboard again.\n\nKansas City's quarterback had three touchdown passes early in the third quarter at Cleveland. Mahomes has 29 TD passes this season, one shy of the team record set by Hall of Famer Len Dawson in 1964.\n\nMahomes threw a 50-yard TD pass to Kareem Hunt and an 11-yarder to Travis Kelce in the first half. He hooked up again with Kelce on a 13-yarder early in second half.\n\nBy halftime, he had more yards passing (3,042) and touchdown passes (28) in his first 10 career games than any other player in league history since 1950.\n\n___\n\n2:47 p.m.\n\nDalvin Cook has made an immediate impact for the Minnesota Vikings in his return to action after missing five of the past six games because of a hamstring injury.\n\nThe second-year running back had a career-long, 70-yard run in the second quarter against Detroit. That set up a short touchdown pass from Kirk Cousins to Adam Thielen. Cook has eight carries for 86 yards in the first half against the Lions, who are last in the league in run defense.\n\nDefensive end Ziggy Ansah is back for the Lions after a six-game absence because of a shoulder injury. He sacked Cousins in the closing seconds of the second quarter to force a field goal. The Vikings lead early in the third quarter.\n\n___\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown has scored for the ninth time, setting a franchise record for touchdowns through the first eight games in a year.\n\nHis latest touchdown came on a 6-yard throw from Ben Roethlisberger, who threw a screen to him and watched as he made a move to get the space he needed to get into the end zone in the second quarter.\n\nBrown also made a spectacular catch in the first half against the Baltimore Ravens, but his leaping grab didn't count because he was out of bounds.\n\n___\n\n2:09 p.m.\n\nJames Conner continues to do a fantastic job filling in for Le'Veon Bell.\n\nPittsburgh's breakout running back scored his 10th touchdown on a 7-yard catch in the first quarter at Baltimore. Since 1950, no one has scored more touchdowns for the Steelers through eight games than Conner. He has made the most of his opportunity to play for Bell, who hasn't signed his one-year franchise tender.\n\n___\n\n1:42 p.m.\n\nThe Washington Redskins are missing most of their starting offensive linemen just minutes into their game against Atlanta.\n\nWashington lost left guard Shawn Lauvao to an injured left knee on its first drive and right tackle Morgan Moses to an injured right knee on its second possession. The Redskins started the game without Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams after he had surgery on his right thumb.\n\nLauvao was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair. Moses limped off the field. Both were listed as questionable to return.\n\nThe Redskins were behind Falcons 7-0 late in the first quarter.\n\n___\n\n1:22 p.m.\n\nFormer NFL receiver Steve Smith has shared a secret.\n\nHe acknowledged on the NFL Network he left his Carolina Panthers' playbook for his new team, the Baltimore Ravens, to find when he was released in 2013. It's not unusual for players to share secrets about their former team after being released or waived, but it is difficult to recall anyone talking about it publicly.\n\n\"When I came in I had the playbook and said, 'It will be on my desk and what you do with it is on you,'\" Smith recalled .\n\nSmith said the playbook was missing from his locker for a couple of days before it was returned and he took it home. Smith said he had a copy of the Panthers' playbook because it was given to him by another player who was cut a couple years before he was released by the team. Smith said he thought the playbook might be helpful if he got into coaching after his playing career.\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nSteelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is wearing custom cleats emblazoned with a Star of David, adorned with the phrase \"Stronger Than Hate,\" in response to recent shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. The Star of David is in yellow and serves as the upper part of the Steelers logo.\n\nRoethlisberger and his wife are friends of Michele Rosenthal, a former team employee. Two of Rosenthal's brothers were among the 11 killed in the late-October shooting.\n\n___\n\n12:46 p.m.\n\nThe surging Pittsburgh Steelers and the slumping Baltimore Ravens are among the NFL teams kicking off Week 9.\n\nThe AFC North-leading Steelers (4-2-1) are aiming for their fourth straight win on the road against the division rival Ravens (4-4), who have lost three of four.\n\nGregg Williams has a challenging debut as Cleveland's interim head coach as the Browns (2-5-1) host the AFC West-leading Kansas City Chiefs, who are a conference-best 7-1.\n\nA pair of games later in the day, and night, should attract a lot of attention.\n\nThe undefeated Los Angeles Rams travel to face the NFC South-leading New Orleans Saints, who have lost only once. Under the lights in New England, Tom Brady will match up with the Green Bay Packers and Aaron Rodgers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And it is fair to wonder if we should just go ahead and mail another national championship trophy to Tuscaloosa (and while we're at it, the Heisman Trophy, too, to Tua Tagovailoa).\n\nAt the very least, it seems certain the Crimson Tide is a lock for the College Football Playoff (we could do thought experiments involving whether 'Bama would get in even with a loss to Georgia in the SEC championship game, but the problem is assuming a loss). So put them in. But the other three spots are still up for grabs, with plenty of time left for chaos (and let\u2019s be honest, we all root for chaos).\n\nSTATEMENT MADE: Alabama's domination of LSU was unnecessary, but impressive\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 10 led by West Virginia's gamble\n\nBOWL PICTURE: Who's in?

West Virginia?) -- and as important: Can they play with 'Bama? LSU certainly could not, which is why the Tigers are no longer in the Football Four. As always, remember we pick the bracket as if the season was over.*\n\nFootball Four\n\n1. Alabama \u2013 The tour of devastation continued. Against LSU, the offense slowed to fairly normal speeds \u2013 but we can officially fast-forward Alabama into the SEC championship game now, and might as well push \u2018em into the Playoff. Can anyone push \u2018em once they get there?\n\n2. Clemson \u2013 The Tigers dominated Louisville (then again, who hasn\u2019t?), continuing their build-up toward a potential showdown (again) with \u2018Bama.\n\n3. Notre Dame \u2013 Ian Book helped the Irish fend off Northwestern\u2019s second-half challenge. Now the challenges to an unbeaten season are dwindling.\n\n4. Michigan \u2013 The Wolverines pounded Penn State and now look by far like the Big Ten\u2019s best team. The defense, we knew. But hello, Shea Patterson and the offense are firing up, too.\n\nFour More **\n\n5. Oklahoma \u2013 With a wacky night in Lubbock in their rearview mirror, the Sooners are closing in on a double-dip with West Virginia \u2013 two meetings in eight days, anyone?\n\n6. Georgia \u2013 The Bulldogs found their running game and exposed Kentucky en route to winning the SEC East again. They\u2019ll meet Alabama in the conference championship game. If they win out en route to Atlanta, it\u2019ll be a de facto playoff quarterfinal.\n\n7. West Virginia \u2013 \u201cWant to win the game? Let\u2019s go win the game.\u201d \u2013 Dana Holgorson, before calling for the two-point conversion that won it in the final seconds against Texas. The Mountaineers are explosive and on track for a showdown with Oklahoma (and then probably another).\n\n8.

The Pac-12\u2019s last hope for the playoff remains alive.\n\nA Few More After That ***\n\nCentral Florida \u2013 The Knights gave up a ton of yards and points to Temple \u2026 but they piled up even more yards and points.\n\nOhio State \u2013 The Buckeyes scrabbled with Nebraska, which is not a good sign that they\u2019ll find some other gear and reemerge as a legitimate contender. But they\u2019re still in position to do it, anyway.\n\nLSU \u2013 Outclassed by Alabama, or just exposed as offensively inept? Let\u2019s go with both. The Tigers are good, but they\u2019re still several significant steps shy of great.\n\nSyracuse \u2013 Remember when Clemson needed a fourth-down conversion by a third-team quarterback to survive an upset bid by Syracuse? Turns out, the Orange aren\u2019t half-bad. After beating Wake Forest, they\u2019re 7-2.\n\nFutile Four ****\n\nTexas \u2013 The Longhorns\u2019 second consecutive loss came in the final seconds to West Virginia. It\u2019ll sting.

This means you, Will Grier \u2013 wait, are you throwing the horns down again right now?\n\nLouisville \u2013 Clemson hung 77, becoming only the latest embarrassment suffered by the Cardinals. Is this the end for Bobby Petrino \u2026 or does it wait a few more weeks? But it\u2019s coming.\n\nPenn State \u2013 Oof, that had to hurt. Michigan pasted the Nittany Lions, who lost for the third time in five games and are fast heading the wrong direction.\n\nColorado \u2013 A few weeks back, Colorado was 5-0. Checking back in now and \u2013 oh, wow, they\u2019re 5-4 after that loss to Arizona. And bowl-eligibility is not a certainty, with games remaining against Washington State, Utah and Cal.\n\n* The season is not over.\n\n** Don\u2019t be worried that your team sits just outside the cut.

That was well beyond expectations, which had pegged the film closer to $35 million to $40 million in its opening weekend.\n\nBut audiences rushed to theaters to see the widely praised performance by Malek, the \"Mr. Robot\" star, and to hear Queen's foot-stomping anthems like \"We Are the Champions,\" ''Another One Bites the Dust\" and the operatic title song. The movie, which Bryan Singer directed before being replaced by Dexter Fletcher, at times has an almost concert-like feel, including a lengthy re-creation of the band's 1985 Live Aid performance.\n\n\"It really is a celebration of Queen and their music, and we did a really good job of letting people know that that's what this is,\" says Chris Aronson, distribution chief for 20th Century Fox.\n\nThe biopic trounced Disney's lavish, big-budget \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms,\" which opened with just $20 million despite a production budget of $125 million.\n\n\"We were hoping for a stronger start, but we do think it's a film that people will find as we head into the holidays,\" says Cathleen Taff, head of theatrical distribution for Disney.\n\nShiver (Richard E.

Music-based films have lately been major draws, from \"The Greatest Showman\" to Oscar favorite \"A Star Is Born,\" which collected another $11.1 million in its fifth weekend for $165.6 million overall.\n\n\"It seems that audiences can't get enough of movies that have music baked into their DNA,\" Dergarabedian says. \"That's proving to be a very successful formula.\"\n\nCLOSE 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury, who defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. 20th Century Fox\n\nBut another winning formula \u2013 Tiffany Haddish plus anything \u2013 came up short over the weekend.\n\n\"Nobody's Fool,\" which paired Haddish with box-office force Tyler Perry, opened in third with a so-so $14 million.

Two films starring Haddish (\"Night School\" and \"The Oath\") have opened in the past six weeks, and \"Night School\" is still No. 12 at the box office.\n\nRounding out the rest of the top five: The latest \"Halloween\" movie with Jamie Lee Curtis, which was fifth with $11 million.\n\nIn limited release, Joel Edgerton's acclaimed gay-conversion therapy drama \"Boy Erased,\" starring Lucas Hedges, opened with a strong per-theater average of $44,000 in five theaters.\n\n\"A Private War,\" starring Rosamund Pike as war correspondent Marie Colvin, opened in four theaters with a per-theater average of $18,000.\n\nFinal numbers are expected Monday.\n\nContributing: Kim Willis\n\nCLOSE If you're seeing a movie this fall, Lucas Hedges is probably in it.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Karen Khachanov upset a tired-looking Novak Djokovic 7-5, 6-4 to win the Paris Masters title and deprive Djokovic of the chance on Sunday to match Rafael Nadal's record of 33 Masters titles.\n\nDjokovic, a record four-time champion at the indoor event, looked out of energy after an epic three-hour semifinal win against Roger Federer on Saturday.\n\nAfter also being taken to three sets by Marin Cilic in Friday's quarterfinals, Djokovic's semifinal finished at around 8 p.m. local time and he felt he was unable to recover sufficiently from that draining encounter.\n\n\"I didn't unfortunately. But I don't want to talk about that,\" Djokovic said. \"I want to talk about how well (Khachanov) played all week and absolutely deserved to win today.\"\n\nAsked again whether it was a case of emotional fatigue, after such an intense tussle with Federer, Djokovic repeated his praise for Khachanov.\n\n\"Karen played really well and he deserved to win,\" Djokovic said. \"All the credit to him.\"\n\nAlthough Djokovic broke in the fourth game to move 3-1 up and then led 30-0 on serve, the unseeded Khachanov broke him straight back and the momentum abruptly shifted away from Djokovic.\n\n\"I stepped in more inside the court,\" Khachanov said. \"I started to move him and maybe he didn't expect that I could do it after being down 3-1 with a break.\"\n\nDjokovic seemed agitated at times and twice turned to his box to remonstrate about an unspecified issue during the first set.\n\nKhachanov broke for 6-5 when he hit a powerful shot down the line that Djokovic could only scoop back into the net. The Russian won the first set with a big first serve that Djokovic could not return, stretching out his racket in vain as the fizzing ball clipped the frame.\n\nDjokovic struggled to handle Khachanov's brutal two-handed, cross-court backhands from the baseline, which often landed near his ankles, and dropped his serve again to trail 2-1 in the second set. He had to save three more break points in the seventh game to hold for 4-3 down.\n\n\"He was playing big from the back of the court, flat backhands and forehand. He can really hurt you,\" Djokovic said. \"His serve is really, really strong and precise.\"\n\nAfter both players held to love, Khachanov showed no nerves \u2014 even though he was in his first Masters final \u2014 and served out the match.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point when Djokovic chopped a backhand return wide. The imposing Khachanov thrust both his arms in the air and, moments later, knelt down to kiss the court.\n\n\"It's a breakthrough season. And this title, it's a good year-end I would say,\" Khachanov said. \"Maybe I'm not crying, but still I'm really happy.\"\n\nDjokovic will return to No. 1 in the rankings for the first time in two years on Monday, but the Serb will be disappointed at missing out on a 73rd career title, having withstood the best of Federer on Saturday.\n\nStill, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion has plenty to feel good about after a 22-match winning streak, and he remains favorite for the season-ending ATP Finals in London, beginning Nov. 11.\n\n\"I'm satisfied of course and I'm going to be No. 1 tomorrow. What more can I ask for? I mean, I won 20-plus matches in a row and had a most amazing last five months,\" he said. \"I'm getting into (the) season finale feeling good about my game.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old Khachanov, ranked 18th, is the first Russian to win here since Nikolay Davydenko in 2006. Marat Safin won it three times before that.\n\nTwo-time Grand Slam champion Safin won the last of his Paris Masters titles in 2004, when Khachanov was a young boy.\n\n\"I watched (Safin's) matches but later, not at the age of eight,\" he said. \"I'm just really proud of myself that I could be in this list of winners.\"\n\nKhachanov added this title to the Kremlin Cup in Moscow last month for his third title of the year and fourth overall.\n\nHe had won his previous three finals, and said his 100 percent record helped him when he stepped on court against the 14-time Grand Slam champion.\n\n\"I was thinking, 'OK, (Djokovic) has, I don't know, 70 titles and I have three,'\" Khachanov said. \"But 3-0, you know? So maybe it was in the back of my mind.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

USA TODAY\n\nLSU Tigers head coach Ed Orgeron. (Photo: Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sport)\n\nEvery coach in every sport who has ever lost a game could, if they wanted to, explain their failure by saying they need to get better players. Most of the time, it happens to be true.\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason you almost never hear coaches go there, at least publicly, and particularly after a disheartening loss.\n\nCoaching is largely about psychology and demanding things of your players that you believe will help them get better. That requires them to buy in to not only the philosophy of the program but also have faith that if they do what the coach says, they will improve their skills and ultimately experience better results. Sending the message they\u2019re not good enough, or that they\u2019re not as good as the theoretical people you want to replace them with, doesn\u2019t do much to activate that belief. In fact, it might discourage it.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was startling to hear LSU coach Ed Orgeron talk so much about the need to recruit better players, particularly along the line of scrimmage, following a comprehensive 29-0 loss to Alabama.\n\n\u201cI told the guys the table was set, the fans were great, the energy all day,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cThere was want-to \u2026 but hey we got beat at the line of scrimmage. I gotta recruit better defensive linemen. Gotta recruit better offensive linemen. Same old thing. Gotta beat Alabama at the line of scrimmage.\u201d\n\nMORE: Alabama's statement against LSU unnecessary, but impressive\n\nMORE: 11 observations from Week 10 of the college football season\n\nBOWL PICTURE: Who is eligible? Who is close? Who is out?\n\nMORE: Harbaugh finally has a Michigan team in his image \u2014 ruthless\n\nOrgeron returned to this theme over and over again following LSU\u2019s eighth consecutive loss to Alabama and insisted it wasn\u2019t scheme (i.e., the coach\u2019s fault) why Crimson Tide defenders were in the backfield all night turning Joe Burrow into chum.\n\n\u201cWhen you max protect you\u2019re doing everything you can in protection and they\u2019re beating you you have to look at personnel,\u201d Orgeron said.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to wonder how that\u2019s going to play in an LSU locker room full of former four- and five-star recruits, many of whom will wind up in the NFL. Even though they know they got beat, you can bet they believe they\u2019re good enough.\n\nDespite the loss, which takes them out of the national title race, the Tigers still have more big games to play and could land in a nice bowl. You need them engaged in what\u2019s going on, not checked out just because of a setback against Alabama.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a real risk for Orgeron to start talking about getting better players, especially when you\u2019re no different in that regard than anyone who plays Alabama. And yet, every now and then someone finds a way to beat those guys.\n\nSomehow, it hasn\u2019t been LSU for a long, long time. And if you\u2019re banking on needing a talent advantage to beat Nick Saban, you\u2019re probably going to be disappointed until he\u2019s done coaching. Having to deal with that reality puts LSU at No. 1 in this week\u2019s Misery Index, a weekly measurement of knee-jerk reactions based on what each fan base just watched.\n\nFOUR MORE IN MISERY\n\nMinnesota Golden Gophers head coach P.J. Fleck during the third quarter against Illinois. (Photo: Mike Granse, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMinnesota: Those who predicted that the boundless enthusiasm and recruiting prowess of young P.J. Fleck would not be enough to overcome the natural disadvantages baked into the Minnesota job have been proved right for now. The Gophers are rowing the boat toward another losing season after a 55-31 blowout at Illinois, which included the Minnesota defense giving up three touchdown plays of 70-plus yards and another 67-yarder. How in the world does a team at this level let that happen?\n\nMinnesota ranks 117th nationally in giving up plays of 40-plus yards with 17 on the season, so that\u2019s one clue. But still, for a coach who is all about the slogans and motivational tools, what happened against Illinois looks like a total loss of pride. When you compare what Fleck has done at Minnesota (9-11 overall, 3-11 Big Ten) to what Jeff Brohm has done in the same amount of time at Purdue (12-10, 8-7), you can\u2019t blame Minnesota fans for having some serious questions.\n\nWestern Kentucky: Not so long ago, the Hilltoppers were both good and entertaining. Now they\u2019re bad and boring. In the second year of the Mike Sanford Jr. era, they\u2019ve slipped to 125th nationally in points per game (18.7) and 103rd in total offense (367 yards per game) and sunk to the bottom of Conference USA with a 1-8 record after a 29-10 loss to Middle Tennessee. Keep in mind, this is a program that hasn\u2019t had a losing season since 2010, which was part of the early transition period from the Football Championship Subdivision, then known as Division I-AA.\n\nThough Sanford is owed a buyout of $1.2 million \u2014 a large number for a C-USA school \u2014 this might be a \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d situation for Western Kentucky. This has been a very solid football program with an enthusiastic and supportive fan base. They can\u2019t afford to see the Hilltoppers slip back into irrelevance this quickly. Sanford, 36, comes from the Jim Harbaugh coaching pipeline and had a reputation as a good offensive coordinator coming from Notre Dame and Boise State before that. But this job has seemed to overwhelm him.\n\nMiami: A year ago, when the famous Hurricanes\u2019 turnover chain was all the rage, Miami football felt fun again. But there was always a fundamental problem with making a celebration of turnovers the central tenet of your success: Turnovers can be fickle. While there\u2019s certainly skill involved in creating turnovers, every person who studies the analytics of football will tell you there\u2019s a lot of luck involved in things like recovering fumbles.\n\nWhen you go on a huge tear of turnovers, as Miami did in 2017 with 31 takeaways, it can mask some fundamental underlying issues. Those issues are now being laid bare in 2018, particularly on the offensive side of the ball. Miami lost its third consecutive game Saturday, mustering just one takeaway while committing two turnovers in a 20-12 loss to Duke. While this game was played in a downpour, it\u2019s alarming that Miami hasn\u2019t scored more than 14 points since Oct. 6.\n\nTexas A&M head coach Jimbo during the second quarter of the Aggies' loss Saturday to Auburn at Jordan-Hare Stadium. (Photo: John Reed, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTexas A&M: If you\u2019re a Texas A&M fan, you probably have one eye on the recruiting rankings, where the Aggies are No. 2 currently for the Class of 2019. That\u2019s got to be heartening. But don\u2019t you also have to have an eye on what\u2019s happening on the field this year \u2014 not just at Texas A&M but also Florida State? Jimbo Fisher, the $75 million man, has his fingerprints on a lot of failure this year in college football. Let\u2019s start with the Aggies, who quickly are regressing to the mean after consecutive road losses to Mississippi State and Auburn, the latter of which came after a crash-and-burn fourth quarter in which it blew a 10-point lead. Moreover, the offense looks stale, as if Fisher is caught between his old ball control style and the spread evolution necessary to succeed now in college football.\n\nIf Texas A&M finishes 7-5, which looks likely at this point, is that some major success when that\u2019s exactly the record that got Kevin Sumlin fired last year? Meanwhile, all those highly ranked recruiting classes Fisher assembled at Florida State are now a fifth-place team in the ACC Atlantic. While Willie Taggart has done a poor job in Tallahassee, those are Fisher\u2019s players, and the trend line toward this was evident last year when Fisher was still there.\n\nTRENDING TOWARD MISERY\n\nTexas: Just when fans thought the Longhorns were breaking through \u2014 oh yes, the \u201cTexas is back\u201d takes were flying a few weeks ago \u2014 they\u2019re back to stumbling around in middle-of-the-Big-12 mediocrity. Texas had plenty of chances the last two weeks to keep its push toward a conference title moving but instead lost by a combined four points to Oklahoma State and West Virginia to fall to 6-3. Saturday\u2019s gut punch, losing 42-41 on a two-point conversion with 16 seconds left, makes the math really hard for Texas to get into the Big 12 title game.\n\nSouth Florida: We all knew this team\u2019s 7-0 record was a house of cards built on close, come-from-behind wins against mediocre teams. But it would have been hard to foresee Saturday\u2019s 41-15 debacle at home against Tulane in which the Bulls allowed 368 rushing yards and lost the turnover battle 3-1. Even worse, USF has an extremely tough close this season with games at Cincinnati, at Temple and home against unbeaten UCF. Not hard to see how 7-0 could turn into 7-5.\n\nNorth Carolina: Though the Tar Heels have been mildly more competitive of late \u2014 they haven\u2019t been truly blown out since Sept. 28 against Miami \u2014 they're still a 1-7 team on the way to 2-10 barring an upset. If that\u2019s the way it plays out, it\u2019s a two-year stretch of 5-19 for Larry Fedora, which is awful no matter how you slice it. But the more you talk to plugged-in people around college athletics, you won\u2019t find anyone right now who believes athletics director Bubba Cunningham is going to spend the $12-plus million to make a coaching change. If Fedora returns, what kind of fan base will he come back to in 2019?\n\nFlorida State: If there's a miracle left out there for the Seminoles this season, they need it now to preserve their NCAA record 36-year bowl streak. It\u2019s a mark of consistency the program has rightly been proud of, but at 4-5 with three games left against ranked teams, the Seminoles are likely staying home for the holidays this year. And that\u2019s going to bring a lot of heat Willie Taggart\u2019s way going into the offseason because there\u2019s no way to spin what Florida State has looked like this year. If there was one bit of good news to come out of a 47-28 loss at N.C. State on Saturday, it's that sophomore James Blackman had a really nice day at quarterback, completing 29 of 46 passes for 421 yards. On the other hand, the Seminoles were never really in the game, which has been a theme far too often on Taggart\u2019s watch.\n\nStanford: As much as we can admire running back Bryce Love\u2019s commitment to education and finishing out his Stanford degree, coming back as a senior has proved to be a poor football decision. Love, who was probably the most dynamic player in the country last year, has been stifled by injuries and larger issues surrounding Stanford\u2019s personnel. Saturday\u2019s 27-23 loss at Washington, in which Love carried the ball 18 times for 71 yards, was the sixth game this season in which he\u2019s been unable to reach 100 yards. Last year he ran for 100-plus 12 times. As Stanford loses for the fourth time in the last five games, you have to ask, did he really come back for this?\n\nTOTALLY REAL AND IRRATIONAL MESSAGE BOARD THREADS\n\n\u201cHire Hugh Freeze, Screw the SEC Office\u201d \u2014 geaux247.com (LSU)\n\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s not as bad as 1983\u201d \u2014 gopherhole.com (Minnesota)\n\n\u201cCan we sue Harbaugh?\u201d \u2014 warchant.com (Florida State)\n\n\u201cSo much for \u2018changing the culture\u2019\u2026\u201d \u2014 TexAgs.com\n\n\u201cBobby Petrino for OC\u201d \u2014 canesinsight.com (Miami)", "UFC 230 ended with Daniel Cormier winning what could be one of his final fights by second-round submission of Derrick Lewis.

(Photo: Aaron Doster, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSURPRISE, Ariz. \u2014 One of the biggest questions as we look toward the 2019 MLB season is how big a role will the game's top prospects play on their parent clubs.\n\nJudging from their performances in the Arizona Fall League \u2014 and in the league's annual Fall Stars Game \u2014 third baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. of the Toronto Blue Jays and first baseman Peter Alonso of the New York Mets should open the season on a major-league roster.\n\nBoth young players did some amazing things Saturday night at the annual showcase event, which was won by the West All-Stars 7-6 on a walk-off single by Kansas City Royals catcher Meibrys Viloria.\n\nGuerrero, 19, flashed some of the skills that made him the unquestioned No. 1 prospect in the minors. In the fifth inning, he hit a double off the left field wall that had an exit velocity of 117 mph.\n\nTo put it in perspective, a total of 11 hitters in the majors last season hit a ball with an exit velocity of 117 mph or higher. That's 11 players ... ALL SEASON.\n\nThis Vlad Guerrero Jr. rocket left the bat at 117 mph. Seemed like it hit off the LF wall in the blink of an eye. #FallStarsGame#FPAZ18pic.twitter.com/iv8fVFqXlU \u2014 Steve Gardner (@SteveAGardner) November 4, 2018\n\nIt's almost comical how good Guerrero was last season. The son of the 2018 Hall of Famer hit a combined .381/.437/.636 with 20 home runs at four different minor league levels. Yet the Jays chose not to promote him to the majors. Looks like he's going to make that decision even more difficult this spring, especially since he's second in the AFL with a .393 average.\n\nGuerrero also walked, reached on an error in the ninth and scored the tying run on a two-out triple by San Diego Padres outfielder Buddy Reed.\n\nReed then scored the winning run on Viloria's single was named the game's MVP.\n\nThat MVP feeling! @Padres Buddy Reed named Fall Stars Game MVP after he triples home the tying run and scores the game winning run in the 9th! pic.twitter.com/mjKKsb3O6H \u2014 Arizona Fall League (@MLBazFallLeague) November 4, 2018\n\nEarlier in the game, it looked like Alonso might be a front-runner for the award.\n\nIn his first at-bat, Alonso, 23, faced hard-throwing Blue Jays right-hander Nate Pearson \u2014 who lit up the ballpark radar gun by hitting 103 mph several times with his fastball, and topping out at 104.\n\n(The skeptic might wonder if the gun could have been running a little hot in an effort to build up some buzz. However, one scout in attendance confirmed the 104 was indeed legit.)\n\nFacing one of those 103 mph fastballs, Alonso turned the tables by belting a home run to center field that gave the East an early 1-0 lead.\n\nMets prospect Peter Alonso turns around a 103-mph fastball from the Blue Jays' Nate Pearson for a solo home run to center. #FallStarsGame#FPAZ18pic.twitter.com/sjVbdWItql \u2014 Steve Gardner (@SteveAGardner) November 4, 2018\n\nAlonso wasn't just impressive with his bat. For the second day in a row, he also showed some slick glovework.\n\nAfter Guerrero doubled in the fifth and moved to third on a bobbled throw from the outfield, the East squad brought in the infield in an effort to keep the run from scoring. The next batter, Cavan Biggio of the Jays, hit a scorcher that Alonso somehow managed to pick on the short hop and tag first before Guerrero could advance.\n\nAlonso made a similar play the day before at Scottsdale Stadium when he dove to snag a short hop and make it to the bag ahead of the runner. If the reason the Mets didn't call him up this season was because he needed to work on his defense, that excuse doesn't seem to fly anymore.\n\nThe Mets with Alonso and the Blue Jays with Guerrero hold the keys to how much the top prospects will contribute in the majors this season. Their service time concerns were one of the major topics of discussion this weekend at the First Pitch Arizona conference put on by the folks at Baseball HQ.\n\nIn the early 2019 fantasy drafts this weekend, Guerrero was taken in the second round \u2014 right around No. 20 overall \u2014 despite not playing a day in the majors and not being guaranteed he'll be on the Blue Jays roster.\n\nThe prevailing opinion is he'll spend the first couple weeks in the minors so the Jays will have him under contract for an additional year, then promote him to take over the starting job at third base. He's certainly proved he has little left to accomplish by playing against minor league pitchers.\n\nThe same can be said for Alonso, whose fielding was the most pleasant surprise for me this trip. His bat certainly looks like it will play in New York.\n\nThe future certainly looks bright for these two rising stars.\n\n(More on some of the other AFL prospects to come ...)\n\nFollow Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner", "This past Tuesday, Russell Westbrook and Patrick Beverley got into a bit of a spat on the court that led to double technical fouls.

The RealClearPolitics average of polls in the race shows Kemp ahead by about one percentage point, well within the margin of error.\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper informed Abrams of Kemp's cybercrime allegation during her appearance Sunday on \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"I've heard nothing about it, and my reaction would be that this a desperate attempt on the part of my opponent to distract people from the fact that two different federal judges found him derelict in his duties,\" Abrams said. \"He is desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures, from his refusal to honor his commitments and from the fact that he is part of a nationwide system of voter suppression that will not work in this election.\"\n\nAbrams, an African-American woman, has accused Kemp of intentionally purging voters to target minorities.\n\nMore: Will Georgia voting controversies discourage voters from turning out?\n\nOn Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Eleanor Ross granted an emergency injunction that will allow 3,141 people to vote in Tuesday's election. Those people had been taken off the rolls because of an \"exact match\" law, which allows zero discrepancies or errors on a voter's registration.\n\nIn her ruling, Ross said she had \"grave concerns\" about \"the differential treatment inflicted on a group of individuals who are predominantly minorities.\"\n\nDemocrats have called on Kemp to step down as secretary of state, accusing him of a conflict of interest in overseeing the office that supervises the state's election while running as a candidate himself.\n\nThe allegations of voter suppression and the possibility that Abrams could become the first African-American woman to be a governor in the United States has drawn national attention to the race.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have traveled to the state to campaign for Kemp.

Control of Congress is on the line as is the fate of Donald Trump's presidency. (Nov. 1) AP\n\nI wish Republicans had checked Trump and been faithful to the Constitution. But my former party failed. Democrats are better bet to preserve democracy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on the South Lawn of the White House, Washington, DC, Nov. 2, 2018. (Photo: Michael Reynolds,EPA-EFE)\n\nThe midterm election Tuesday is not a primarily a choice between conservatives and liberals or their policies. It would be, in the words of Ernest Hemingway, \u201cpretty to think so,\u201d but it is not true.\n\nYes, there are some important issues pending as we head into the 116th Congress: health care, an idiotic trade war, an arms control treaty. Yet they pale in comparison to what should be the overriding concern of every American citizen of any party or affiliation: the preservation and protection of our constitutional system of government.\n\nThis is a serious claim. How much damage, really, can any one member of Congress, or any state or local official, make to our way of life?\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, plenty, if they choose to run under the banner of a party that is now little more than the vehicle of an ignorant and rage-addicted cult of personality. The 2018 midterms are, more than anything else, a referendum on the corrosive changes in our political life wrought by the current president of the United States. Donald Trump himself has said so. \u201cI'm not on the ticket,\u201d he said last month, \u201cbut I am on the ticket, because this is also a referendum about me.\u201d\n\nTrump aim: Ensure we can't tell truth from lies\n\nTake a moment to consider how far we fallen from even our most basic standards of political conduct in just a few years.\n\nFreedom of the press? Despite a mass murder of Jews in Pittsburgh and an attempted mass assassination of more than a dozen prominent Americans by men parroting the rhetoric of his most fervent supporters, Trump has accused the media of being the true source of violence in our public life. He has raised the idea of yanking broadcast licenses and shrugged off the murder of a columnist for an American newspaper while continuing to inveigh against journalists at his anger-soaked mass rallies.\n\nExecutive power? Republicans once defended the principle of limited government. No longer. Today, Trump talks about rolling back the 14th Amendment of the Constitution (\"birthright citizenship\") by executive order, and a mostly compliant GOP and its servants in the right-wing media scramble to praise this Caesarism not only as defensible and but as lovely to behold.\n\nMore: Trump sending troops to block caravan at Mexico border is peak waste, fraud and abuse\n\nTrump bears moral responsibility for pipe bombs. Denying it just makes things worse.\n\nPittsburgh shooting: It's too late for Trump to be credible on uniting US against hate\n\nJudicial overreach? The Republican Party I joined in my youth during the Reagan years was implacably opposed to the rule of \u201cunelected judges.\u201d Today, Republicans are so insecure about their own ideas that they have sold out everything else conservatives once cared about \u2014 free trade, a strong foreign and defense policy, the importance of character in politics \u2014 to get two more Supreme Court justices they hope will carry on their narrow crusades (primarily against Obamacare and legalized abortion) even if they themselves are swept from power.\n\nLaw and order? Respect for the military? The president has attacked America\u2019s law enforcement and intelligence organizations, including his own attorney general, as part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d out to get him. He has played politics with security clearances, while his own White House is riddled with conflicts of interest and shockingly lax security procedures. Meanwhile, the president has pushed for a huge, showy, and ultimately pointless deployment of troops to the Mexican border, a move that seems more like political theater than the protection of national security.\n\nPerhaps most important, the president is in a full-blown assault on the notion of truth itself. Or, more accurately, he is doing everything in his power to ensure that ordinary citizens cannot tell the difference between the truth and a lie. He has inoculated millions of Americans against ever grasping a fact of which he does not approve by demanding that citizens of a democracy behave as though they are subjects of an authoritarian state, and accept that he, personally, is the only source of truth.\n\nRepublicans fail oversight, constitutional fidelity\n\nSome Republicans, while wincing, are meekly trying to sell a passel of judges, a tax cut and some regulatory rollback as worth all of this. Others, meanwhile, have followed the president\u2019s lead and resorted to inane but nonetheless dangerous conspiracy theories. They warn of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants, chant the mantra of \u201cfake news,\u201d and level the usual scummy and anti-Semitic slurs on \u201cglobalists\u201d and the orders they\u2019re supposedly taking from Jewish philanthropist George Soros.\n\nThe Democrats, a party still reeling from years of losses that culminated in the shock of 2016, are themselves still something of a hot mess. Whether they can do better than the GOP as a governing party is up to them. But they are far less of a threat to our constitutional order.\n\nThe choice now is whether to continue to enable the president\u2019s behavior, or to contain him with the reliable device of divided government. As a former Republican, I would have preferred that the Republican Party itself had opposed Trumpism by exercising the self-control, prudence, stoicism, and dedication to unwritten norms that once marked traditional conservatives. The Republicans, however, have failed the tests not only of responsible oversight, but of constitutional fidelity. Their removal from the majority is crucial to preserving a democracy that must survive long after Trump and his courtiers are gone.\n\nTom Nichols, who left the Republican Party last month to become an independent, is a professor of national security affairs at the Naval War College, an instructor at the Harvard Extension School, and the author of \"The Death of Expertise.\" The views expressed here are solely his own.

(Photo: Elaine Thompson, AP)\n\nLess than a week after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, shooting survivor and high school junior Jaclyn Corin was at the Florida state Capitol.\n\nIn Tallahassee, she led a group of more than 100 students to attend more than 70 meetings with state legislators, urging them to pass measures that might prevent mass shootings like the one that had just ravaged their school.\n\nCorin, 18, called the trip \"eye-opening.\" She said she met several legislators who weren't receptive to what she had to say. That convinced Corin and other Parkland shooting survivors \u2013 many of whom were not 18 \u2013 that there was only one thing they could do to ensure their demands would be met.\n\n\u201cYou can always lobby, and you can always protest,\" Corin said. \u201cBut the only direct way to actually get involved is to vote.\u201d\n\nEight months later, voters of Corin's generation are a highly watched cohort for the midterm elections. Voters ages 18 to 29, whose turnout has historically been low in midterm elections, could help decide close races across the country.\n\nMatt Deitsch, a 2016 graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, had two younger siblings who survived the shooting. Deitsch lobbied in Washington, where he met with \"some people who were incredibly divisive and ignorant and rude.\"\n\n\"We realized really quickly that we can\u2019t solve this problem when we have those types of people in office,\" said Deitsch, 21.\n\nYoung people aren't typically a reliable voting bloc. They're transient, frequently changing addresses. They're busy with college and work. Often they're apathetic about politics, or they worry their votes won't matter.\n\nIn the 2014 midterms, Generation Xers and millennials accounted for 53 percent of eligible voters but cast 36 million votes \u2013 21 million fewer than the boomer, silent and greatest generations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about who are you going to vote for in November, it\u2019s about whether or not you\u2019re going to vote,\" said Olivia Bercow, a spokeswoman for NextGenAmerica, a liberal group focused on turning out young voters.\n\nMore: 2018 midterms: Racial justice motivating factor for young voters of color, poll finds\n\nMore: Midterms: Races for governor, statehouses will help decide control of Congress for a decade\n\nCould this year be different?\n\nThe 2018 midterms are happening against a backdrop of political and cultural divides. Activism on the left has surged nearly nonstop since President Donald Trump took office.\n\nThe day after Trump's inauguration, more than 3 million protesters convened in Washington and cities across the country for the Women's March, probably the largest single day of protest in U.S. history.\n\nSubsequent protests and marches surrounding immigration, climate change and gun violence also drew large crowds.\n\nIt's all a recipe, some experts said, for youth turnout to finally make a difference.\n\nJohn Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, has studied the youth vote since 2000. He compared today's environment with the political sentiment that followed 9/11: high emotions and a desire for action.\n\n\u201cI think now we have a moment that reminds me, from this perspective, of the post-9/11 moment, where politics matters to a new generation of young Americans who are considering voting for the first time,\" he said.\n\nToday's young liberals want their politicians to address deep, structural inequalities, Della Volpe said. In general, they're more concerned about the health of American democracy and American capitalism than their parents are. They care about race, access to education, health care and climate change.\n\n\"The issues that Bernie Sanders put on the table back in 2016 are very much the issues that are driving the enthusiasm in 2018,\" Della Volpe said.\n\nExperts said enthusiasm is higher among young Democrats than young Republicans this cycle. A poll in October by the Institute of Politics found that 54 percent of 18- to 29-year-old Democrats planned to \"definitely vote,\" compared with 43 percent of Republicans and 24 percent of independents.\n\nYoung voters entering the workforce in a strong job market will be motivated to vote Republican, said Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, a conservative organization aimed at energizing college students.\n\n\"It's a tough economy to argue against,\" he said.\n\nMore divisive issues are at play, too. Kirk highlighted the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who testified about sexual assault allegations made against him by professor Christine Blasey Ford, as a motivating force this election cycle for young Republicans, many of whom view political correctness on their campuses with distaste.\n\n\u201cA lot of our young conservatives are energized by how disgusted they are with what they see on the left,\" Kirk said.\n\nMore: Facebook, Twitter make moves to guard against misinformation in 2018 midterms and beyond\n\nMore: Midterms 2018: Faith leaders try creative steps to urge people to vote. 'It is an act of worship'\n\nThe Parkland effect\n\nA significant part of surging enthusiasm among young people, mainly on the Democratic side, can be traced back to Corin, Deitsch and other students and graduates of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, who have turned anti-gun violence sentiment into a serious political force.\n\n\u201cWe realized very early on that the only way we can create substantial change is to vote morally just leaders into office,\u201d said Deitsch, chief strategist at March For Our Lives. \u201cUntil we actually vote out these politicians that pick money and power over human life, then we\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\"\n\nMarch For Our Lives, the organization that sprung from the Parkland students' early activism and is still run by the students themselves, is nonpartisan and doesn't endorse specific candidates.

Control of Congress is on the line as is the fate of Donald Trump's presidency. (Nov. 1) AP\n\nI can't support a party working to sabotage health care for Americans with pre-existing conditions. Health care is more important than partisanship.\n\nMontel Williams in New York City, June, 2016. (Photo: Andrew Toth)\n\nOn Halloween, the Trump administration\u2019s administrator of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, made a joke on Twitter that the scariest Halloween costume would be \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nAs a Miami resident and a former longtime Republican, I\u2019m not laughing. I\u2019m voting, and I\u2019m voting only for those who make solving our health care crisis a priority.\n\nI was once a proud Republican. But on health care, the Republican Party has left me and the 130 million Americans under age 65 who have pre-existing conditions out in the cold, and I voted accordingly. I've always believed that health care was a right, not a political football to be used to appeal to a radical fringe.\n\nHowever, the true tipping point for me wasn't one tweet or one policy change, but a recent personal experience.\n\nA few months ago, while working out at the gym, I heard a loud pop in my head, followed by a wave of disorientation and tiredness. It was a cerebral hemorrhagic stroke. I was lucky that my wife was nearby to call an ambulance, and luckier still to make it out with my life after a 21-day hospital stay that began with a week in intensive care.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t my first health issue, but for me, it was a revelation. A brush with death makes you count your blessings, and I realized that chief among mine is the care that I\u2019m able to afford.\n\nYour wealth should not decide your health\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which has been a painful, chronic condition that I have managed to treat, albeit expensively. One of my daughters is a two-time cancer survivor. While I\u2019m blessed to have the resources to protect myself and my family, most aren\u2019t so fortunate.\n\nLast week, I took part in a rally with the organization Protect Our Care and Florida congressional candidate Mary Barzee Flores at the Borinquen Medical Center to raise awareness about how and who the Affordable Care Act protects. Survivor after survivor at the event shared stories of harrowing illness and how they owe their life to the ACA.\n\nTheir stories are by no means unique. Miami has the highest concentration of Obamacare enrollees of anywhere in the nation at more than 360,000 people. And that doesn\u2019t factor in the hundreds of thousands of South Floridians with pre-existing conditions.\n\nMore: Vote for Democrats to end Trump assaults on truth, health care and families: DNC chair\n\nRepublicans have fought for a better, safer America. To keep it, vote for us: RNC chair\n\nDonald Trump could get the last laugh in the 2020 presidential election\n\nDespite these facts, we have Gov. Rick Scott and a Republican-led legislature who've stubbornly refused to lead by expanding Medicaid. The Republican nominee for governor, Ron DeSantis, actually once suggested that folks who can\u2019t afford health care can seek it out \u201cat the emergency room.\u201d And even now, our Attorney General Pam Bondi has joined into a multistate lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile some Republicans like Scott might pretend they\u2019ve always supported protections for pre-existing conditions, actions speak far louder than campaign commercials.\n\nThe simple truth is this: My former party\u2019s reckless obsession with gutting the ACA is a clear-and-present danger to as many as 130 million Americans, myself and my daughter included, who live with or have had a serious illness that counts as a pre-existing condition. In this country, and in this state, your wealth should not decide your health.\n\nRepublicans' reckless sabotage campaign\n\nI\u2019ve been proud to support conservative local lawmakers over the years, such as Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (with whom I am friends and whom I admire for her vote to protect the ACA), and my neighboring congressman, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, in whom I see the future I had always wanted for my former party. But this year, for my future, my kids\u2019 future and my future grandkids' future, I voted the entire Democratic ticket for the first time in my adult life and am urging other voters to do the same.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: The ACA is by no means perfect. There are problems with high deductibles and insurance rates. We deserve representation that will fix these problems in a bipartisan way \u2014 not irresponsibly take a sledgehammer to the entire policy for partisan gain without the slightest idea how to replace it.\n\nIf my former party would stop its deliberate campaign of sabotage, many of the problems with the ACA could be quickly remedied.\n\nThis November, I believe we will witness a wave of voters at the polls who are neither Republican voters nor Democratic voters but health care voters. Count me in as one of them.\n\nPolitical independent Montel Williams, a 22-year veteran of the Marine Corps and Navy who served primarily as a special duty intelligence officer, went on to start the Emmy-award-winning \"Montel Williams Show\" that ran for 17 seasons.

USA TODAY\n\nA fanned pile of cash lying atop a fanned pile of Treasury bonds. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWhether you\u2019re a recent college grad, mid-career professional or senior, deciding how much to put in stocks and bonds can be confusing.\n\nSome people base their decision to go with one or the other on risk tolerance \u2013 comfort with big market wiggles \u2013 and little else. Some follow rules of thumb like \"Subtract your age from 100, put the difference in stocks and the rest in bonds.\u201d Easy rule, but wrongheaded.\n\nSo unless you consider your goals, you\u2019re aiming without a target \u2013 and that means you're likely to miss.\n\nA huge factor that is usually poorly considered when people split their investments between stocks and bonds is time horizon \u2013 which is basically how long your savings must provide for you.\n\nMany confuse it with retirement, when you shift from socking money away to taking it out. Others realize their time horizon is their whole life, but forget to consider younger spouses or heirs. If Jim is 60 and married to 50-year-old Judy, his time horizon is really hers, and it's likely 35 years or longer.\n\nLengthen time horizon\n\nWhatever your situation, your savings likely must last a long while \u2013 at least for your own lifetime, which is probably longer than you think! If you\u2019re retiring now, for example, odds are you\u2019ll see your mid-80s at least. Younger folks have a high chance of passing 90.\n\nMy advice is to tack several years onto whatever your personal life estimate is, just in case. Averages aren\u2019t predictive. No one wants to be impoverished late in life because they didn\u2019t think they would be here.\n\nMore Money: Economy adds robust 250,000 jobs in October in last employment report before election\n\nMore Money: 'Colossal collapse' in gas prices expected heading into midterm elections\n\nMore Money: 9 Amazon Prime perks you didn\u2019t know about \u2013 until now\n\nSet your big goals\n\nThen, discern your main goals. Start by jotting down what your retirement money must accomplish for you. Provide for daily needs? Fund some jet-setting? Weddings and college tuition for kids or grandkids? Support late-life medical care?\n\nFrom my experience watching thousands of clients over decades, these objectives usually add up to one of three big goals: Long-term growth, ongoing cash flow or some combo or the two. Even if your objectives are all cash-flow oriented, you probably still need some growth.\n\nConsider inflation\n\nWhy? Inflation! Since 1925, inflation has averaged about 3 percent annually, eating purchasing power. That's annoying.\n\nIf it remains at that level in the long run, someone who needs $50,000 for annual living expenses now would need around $90,000 in 20 years and $120,000 in 30 years. If you stashed a cool million bucks under your mattress now, in 30 years it would only have the purchasing power of $400,000 today.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just an overall average. Total inflation doesn\u2019t measure personal costs of living. Hospital service costs, for example, have jumped 314 percent since 1989. Medical care and drug costs have soared over 150 percent. Your money doesn\u2019t just need to support you longer than you think, it probably needs to be able to purchase much more than you expect.\n\nLong-term growth\n\nFor most folks, even those who are retired, the solution is some bigger chunk of stocks for far longer than they thought \u2013 which is how you get long-term growth. Over long stretches \u2013 20, 30 years or more \u2013 stocks usually do far better than other liquid alternatives like bonds. While there are more ups and downs along the way, the long-term growth of stocks can ensure your golden years aren\u2019t pyrite.\n\nDepending on your personal situation, you will eventually need bonds too \u2013 not for income, since you will be slowly using your principle, but to help smooth the bumps and support your cash flow.\n\nMost folks I see err most by putting too little in stocks.

Many people disagree. One of the goals of legalizing and regulating marijuana is to ultimately undermine the illicit market. Dealers in the streets don\u2019t card their customers; dispensaries do.

He also served more than a decade as an officer in the National Guard, including seven years on active duty. He previously served two tours in the Iraq War and one in Afghanistan.\n\nTaylor began another one-year tour in Afghanistan in January.

And that\u2019s before accounting for the atmosphere, with decibel levels ratcheted somewhere past ridiculous.\n\nBut ridiculous also describes Alabama\u2019s brilliance. Through nine games, no one has wanted \u2018Bama. Does anyone?\n\nIt begins \u2013 we already knew this \u2013 with Tua Tagovailoa. Although the touchdowns did not come as easily, it still looked at times as though the sophomore quarterback was at the controls of a video game.\n\nHe tossed darts to wide open receivers who zig-zagged through the secondary. He dropped a teardrop into the arms of tight end Irv Smith, a devastatingly perfect connection near the end of the second quarter that sent Alabama into the locker room at halftime ahead 16-0 \u2013 and sucked all of the roar out of Tiger Stadium. And in the third quarter, Tagovailoa ran 44 yards for a score, \u201cgalloping the last 30 yards,\u201d he said, after tweaking something in that right knee.\n\nBut as important was an all too familiar defensive performance \u2013 but which we hadn\u2019t seen this season. Alabama held LSU to 196 total yards, and 12 rushing yards. Take out the lost yardage from sacks, and LSU\u2019s rushing total skyrocketed to 41.\n\n\u201cThey just overpowered us,\u201d LSU Coach Ed Orgeron said, \u201cand there was nothing we could do about it.\u201d\n\nWhat did it all mean?\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine nothing,\u201d Tagovailoa said. And then he paused for a minute and looked, at the far end of the field, toward the giant videoboard, where the score was long gone.\n\n\u201cAll we did was come out here and play football,\u201d he continued, and then a few moments later, he added: \u201cIt shows you what kind of things we can do against basically anyone.\u201d\n\nAlternate explanation: LSU was so offensively-challenged, it had little chance to pose a threat. Orgeron has galvanized LSU, which fell out of realistic playoff contention but still might be headed for at least 10 wins. But in the end, what we suspected was exposed.\n\nDespite that 7-1 start and the lofty ranking, LSU is not elite, and it\u2019s because of the same ol\u2019 offensive issues that have dogged the program for years. Never mind the raucous atmosphere. Never mind a defense that was easily the best Alabama had faced.\n\nLSU had no chance.\n\nBut maybe, neither does anyone else.\n\nInside the SEC, at least, that certainly seems true. Alabama continued a string of dominance within college football\u2019s proudest conference that is astonishing. It is hard to gauge how good the competition in the league actually is. Preconceived notions die hard \u2013 which is how, as one example, a middling, two-loss Florida team was somehow ranked No. 11 by the playoff committee last week, largely based on its win against LSU; Missouri blew out the Gators Saturday in Gainesville.\n\nBut look around college football at the contenders jockeying for playoff position. Which of them seem likely to truly want \u2018Bama, much less to beat them?\n\nThe list might begin and end with Clemson, which seems built with the kind of complete structure \u2013 superb defense, potent offense with a quarterback who is getting better each week. We could be headed toward yet another showdown of Tide vs. Tigers.\n\nAnyway, we can at least fast-forward Alabama into the SEC championship game against Georgia. No, really. Both clinched their divisions Saturday, the earliest it has happened.\n\nSaban first questioned whether a reporter was correct in citing that fact, and then began tamping down talk about the bigger picture. Up next is Mississippi State. Then comes the traditional November FCS pastry (this year it\u2019s The Citadel). And then Auburn.\n\nGiven what we\u2019ve seen so far, it seems safe to assume those final three regular-season games are simply more statements waiting to be made (and Georgia, let\u2019s not forget, lost by 20 points in Baton Rouge a few weeks back). Just don\u2019t try to tell it to Saban.\n\n\u201cOur focus,\u201d Saban said, \u201cis gonna be, \u2018You did a great job in this game and I\u2019m proud of you, but we\u2019ve got to do it again.\u2019 That\u2019s got to be who we are.\u201d\n\nNot that it really needed proving \u2013 but they are for real.", "It\u2019s a good time to be the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nA five-win team sitting on a bye week, the Bengals get to kick back and watch the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers go at it. Meanwhile, the hapless Cleveland Browns will take a revamped coaching staff into a battle with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nThese are the stories Bengals fans should keep an eye on during the bye.\n\nRavens looking for a spark\n\nThe Ravens were quietly one of the teams active at the trade deadline, dealing for former Green Bay weapon Ty Montgomery.\n\nMontgomery won\u2019t have a defined role with the Ravens because he hasn\u2019t yet at the pro level. But it makes sense the Ravens are looking for help. Joe Flacco has completed just 61.1 percent of his passes this year and the running game averages 3.6 yards per carry.\n\nThe Ravens already beat the Steelers once this year and the Bengals should be rooting for them to complete the season sweep. Whether the offense can do enough damage remains to be seen.\n\nLe\u2019Veon Bell drama for Steelers\n\nThose Steelers won\u2019t have Bell on the field once again after he didn\u2019t get traded at the deadline.\n\nGranted, the Steelers have been doing just fine without Bell and are now winners of three in a row. Replacement James Conner has 599 yards and nine touchdowns on a 4.7 per-carry average.\n\nAs the #Steelers get ready to begin meetings for another Wednesday of a work week, RB Le\u2019Veon Bell is not present. He wasn\u2019t going to show up before the trade deadline, ensuring he\u2019d remain on the team\u2026 but he didn\u2019t show up after, either. Still James Conner\u2019s show. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 31, 2018\n\nGranted, the three-win streak consists of wins over bad Cleveland and Atlanta teams and the Bengals, a team the Steelers usually beat. Against Baltimore, Conner only ran it nine times for 19 yards, so there is hope the Ravens can help the Bengals out and get another win.\n\nAll things Browns\n\nWhere to even start?\n\nHue Jackson and Todd Haley are out. Freddie Kitchens is the new offensive coordinator. They have a new QBs coach. New head coach Gregg Williams is saying some of the silliest stuff this side of Jon Gruden.\n\nThe Browns are 2-5-1 and now have to play the Chiefs and still don\u2019t have a bye until Week 11.\n\nAs usual, the ineptitude and chaos of the organization command the conversation.", "bad url", "Ryan Blaney holds up the traditional Texas Motor Speedway rifle after winning the pole for Sunday's AAA Texas 500.

A peculiar smell in the air tells you marijuana producers have already figured that out.\n\nAcross Canada, gleaming glass greenhouses that once grew produce for consumers are being retrofitted with air filters and light-blocking shades. Gone are the tomato plants and peppers. In their place are tens of thousands of sun-grown cannabis plants and hundreds of farmworkers transplanting, watering, trimming and packaging pot.\n\nExperts say these highly sophisticated operations are the future of marijuana production internationally. The hope is that they will drive the price of pot so low, black marketeers give up.\n\n\"We haven't changed the footprint,\" said Rob Hill, CFO of Emerald Health Therapeutics, which is growing marijuana in Delta. \"We've just changed the crop.\"\n\nCanada became the second and largest nation to legalize marijuana on Oct. 17. The country's legal marijuana system requires that cannabis be grown indoors by licensed providers, so Emerald Health Therapeutics partnered with a longtime produce operation, Village Farms, in a joint venture called Pure Sunfarms capable of producing a staggering 82 tons of marijuana annually from the 1.1 million square foot greenhouse complex about 30 minutes south of Vancouver.\n\nAn aerial view of the Pure Sunfarms cannabis greenhouse complex in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nCanada's decision to legalize and regulate marijuana sales is being closely watched globally by governments, regulators and cannabis investors who claim the nation's precedent-setting move could herald broader acceptance of legal pot, particularly in the United States. The business of pot is a prime motivator. Today, wholesale marijuana sells for about $600 a pound in some U.S. states that have legalized it, making it a far more valuable crop than lettuce, almonds or tomatoes, where per-plant profit margins are usually measured in fractions of a penny.\n\nThe price of pot reflects the reality that it largely remains a boutique crop, often grown under expensive electric lights in warehouses. Illegal growers may also cut corners by growing outside on remote federal land they've illegally bulldozed and turned into makeshift farms, but even then, their margins reflect the potential prosecution they face.\n\nBecause cannabis \u2013 and even hemp \u2013 has been illegal to grow in most parts of the U.S., highly effective and efficient farming operations have stayed away from marijuana, mostly ceding the space to hobbyists and enthusiasts, or Mexican drug cartels.\n\nA worker at Canadian marijuana producer Pure Sunfarms trims a plant inside a greenhouse.

Oct. 15, 2018; Delta, British Columbia, Canada; xxx Mandatory credit: Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK (Photo: Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nExperts and regulators say driving down the price of legal marijuana will help drive out those cartels and black-market dealers, in part by moving cannabis growing into farmland like Delta's, where high-value crops can be grown more cheaply.It's already happening, to some extent: Three years ago, wholesale marijuana was selling for $2,000 a pound. Retail prices have also dropped as competition increased: In Colorado, for instance, the price of smokable \u201cflower\u201d has dropped 40 percent since January 2014, from $7 a gram to $4.19 a gram today, according to BDS Analytics.\n\n\"The price was always set based on risk,\" said Kyle Speidell, co-founder and CEO of The Green Solution, a 17-store cannabis company based in Colorado that was paying $5,000 a pound for marijuana when it first opened four years ago.\n\nAs an increasing number of U.S. states have legalized marijuana, growers are getting more comfortable and scaling up their operations. Indoor growers of both legal and black-market marijuana consumed 4.1 million megawatt-hours of electricity last year, roughly equal to the total electricity generated annually by the Hoover Dam, according to cannabis analytics firm New Frontier Data. The company said electricity costs make up to 20 percent of indoor growing prices, compared with 8 percent for outdoor grows.\n\nGreenouses filled with marijuana shine in the sunlight in Delta, Canada, at Canadian marijuana producer Pure Sunfarms. Oct. 15, 2018; Delta, British Columbia, Canada; xxx Mandatory credit: Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK (Photo: Trevor Hughes, Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nWhile growing outdoors is cheaper, it limits the number of crops growers can harvest a year. Growing in greenhouses, however, reduces electricity costs and the amount of water and pesticides needed for growing outdoors. It also allows growers to maintain crops year-round in the right climate.\n\n\"We're seeing a shift away from people who were effectively hobby growers,\" said Karson Humiston, 26, the founder of cannabis staffing firm Vangst in Santa Monica, California. \"It's all going to Big Ag. That's definitely where the industry is shifting. For them, what's the difference in growing lettuce, tomatoes or cannabis?\"\n\nHumiston's company, Vangst, has grown rapidly by providing part-time workers to large-scale marijuana farmers. Each of her 600 temp laborers is background checked, carries worker's compensation insurance and is banned from consuming on the job. It's all part of the industry's move away from the days when cannabis farmers and trimmers got high while working, and had no legal recourse if they got hurt on the job.\n\n\"You've got people who were paid in cash, paid in pounds of weed, and if you've got unlimited money and paying no taxes, who cares?\" Humiston said.\n\nA marijuana plant grows inside a sunny greenhouse in Delta, Canada, at Canadian marijuana producer Pure Sunfarms. Oct. 15, 2018; Delta, British Columbia, Canada; xxx Mandatory credit: Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK (Photo: Trevor Hughes, Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nInside Pure Sunfarms' cannabis vault, more than two tons of processed marijuana \u2013 4,400 pounds of it \u2013 are awaiting distribution to government-sanctioned stores. At current Canadian prices, that cannabis is worth somewhere around $20 million, and Pure Sunfarms plans to harvest similar crops more than 80 times a year.\n\n\"The only guys who are going to be able to play in the game are the larger ones because they have the economies of scale,\" said Matt Karnes, a cannabis analyst and founder of GreenWave Advisors in New York City. \"It really doesn't bode well for the small guy.\"\n\nAt the Pure Sunfarms facility, master grower Rob Baldwin is the definition of the big guy. Once responsible for producing millions of pounds of tomatoes annually, Baldwin is now responsible for growing tens of millions of dollars worth of cannabis a year.\n\n\"There's just one way to grow tomatoes,\" Baldwin said. \"Eventually, there's only going to be one way to grow cannabis in a greenhouse. Figuring that out is interesting to me.\"\n\nBaldwin's techniques manifest themselves in the way the cannabis plants are grown from cuttings, how workers manage the massive grow rooms and even how far apart the plants are and how much extra ventilation they get from special ceiling fans. Walking a visitor around the facility \u2013 in clean-room jackets, hairnets and booties \u2013 Baldwin beams at the healthy plants reaching toward the sun.\n\nKarnes said Pure Sunfarms' approach is likely to be replicated elsewhere, particularly in other places where land is cheap and farmers are struggling to stay afloat with traditional crops.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's no different than any other crop,\" he said. \"Whatever they're doing today in Canada is going to be the eventual template for the United States.\"\n\nMarijuana products and plants on display at The Green Solution dispensary in Denver, Colorado.

Lee quickly faded, playing the opening nine at 7-over 43 and opening the door for Hataoka, who played the same stretch at 4-under 36. Hataoka had a setback after the turn, carding consecutive bogeys at the 11th and 12th and allowing Ciganda to briefly pull into a tie for the lead. But Hataoka regained her confidence with a clutch par save at No. 13, and her birdie at No. 14 reclaimed the lead.\n\n\"I realize something has to come to me and I had to get through it, and I knew it was at the 13th hole,\" said Hataoka of the putt that saved her round. \"I was not totally comfortable with the shot, but I was calm enough to play well on that hole.\"\n\nCiganda had a chance to tie Hataoka at No. 18 but left her birdie putt from above the hole too short.

(AP) \u2014 If there's one constant about San Diego State this season, it's going to be a close game. And coach Rocky Long is ok with that.\n\nThe Aztecs committed three big turnovers, had nine costly penalties and had to come back from a nine-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat New Mexico 31-23 on Saturday.\n\n\"What we do is we keep hanging in there, we keep fighting and we keep playing,\" he said. \"And all but twice we've won. I think we're 7-2 right now and that's as good as a whole bunch of teams and better than a whole bunch of teams in the country. So that's who we are and we're going to live with it.\"\n\nSan Diego State (7-2, 4-1 Mountain West) had played six straight games that were decided by seven points or less, and this one was close as well until Juwan Washington broke off a 50-yard touchdown run with 55 seconds left.\n\n\"That's who we are,\" Long said. \"We've done it so many times now. We're not going to change out personality. You can't change a team's personality. We don't want to get penalties. We don't want to turn the ball over. I've got to live with it and it will probably cost us another game. Maybe not. Maybe not. I'm resolved to the fact so I'm not fighting it anymore.\"\n\nDespite the late hole, Long said he wasn't really concerned.\n\n\"I didn't feel comfortable, but I didn't think we were going to lose if that's your question,\" he said. \"I felt like we were going to win. I felt like we were going to win the whole time. I was just waiting for the play to make it happen. \"\n\nThere was no one play, but the Aztecs scored the game's final 17 points to take the victory.\n\n\"Obviously when we you don't play very well and you win the game, you feel very fortunate,\" Long said. \"But, guess what that's who we are. We're not going to change it. That's the way our whole season has been and that's who we are. So we'll just have to keep playing that way and see if we can pull it out at the end.'\n\nWashington had 95 yards rushing and two touchdowns on 11 carries and quarterback Christian Chapman rallied the Aztecs late in the victory, while a John Baron II field goal put San Diego State ahead for good at 24-23 with 2:56 to play.\n\nThe trailed 23-14 after the Lobos (3-6, 1-4) only sustained touchdown drive of the game with 10 minutes remaining.\n\nBut Chapman rallied his squad with a 75-yard scoring drive.\n\n\"In those situations, you don't want to get flustered,\" Chapman said. \"As a quarterback you don't want to make stupid decisions.\"\n\nAfter the San Diego State defense held New Mexico on the next possession, Garrett Binkley returned the punt 35 yards to the Lobos 41.\n\nNew Mexico was then called for its first penalty, roughing the passer, with 5:25 left, pushing the Aztecs to the Lobos 30. Three plays later, Baron hit the go-ahead 32-yard field goal.\n\nFollowing a San Diego State interception, Washington went 50 yards for a touchdown to seal it.\n\n\"I think we've been doing it all season,\" Chapman said. \"It's been a fight. Every game has been a fight. They're always close. That's the theme for this team this year. We're fighters and we're going to grind to the end. That's how are games are going to be this season.\"\n\nThe Lobos finished the first half with two complete passes, both of which went for negative yards. They didn't get into the positive yardage column until late in the third quarter and finished with 41 yards passing.\n\nNew Mexico's 10 first-half points, however, were the direct result of two fumble recoveries by Adebayo Soremekun, including one that he returned 44 yards for a touchdown. The Lobos also had a short field in the third quarter thanks to a third fumble recovery, leading to another touchdown.\n\n\"I thought our defense, as beat up as we are, played pretty physical,\" New Mexico coach Bob Davie said.\n\nGIVETH & TAKETH\n\nThat the Aztecs lost the turnover edge is not really news - at least this season. San Diego State entered the game with 11 turnovers and eight takeaways, quite a contrast from the previous three seasons when the Aztecs averaged 27 takeaways versus 13 turnovers.\n\n\"It's a huge concern because anytime we turn the ball over, it gives the other team momentum,\" Long said. \"And in this case they even scored off a turnover and had a real short field off of turnovers.\"\n\nNew Mexico's three fumble recoveries give them six in the past two games after three in the first seven games.\n\nWELCOME BACK\n\nChapman, who missed six games with a knee sprain, entered the game in the second quarter and went the rest of the way, finishing 13-for-19 for 182 yards and one touchdown. Washington also was an injured returnee, coming back from a fractured clavicle that cost him four games.\n\nWHAT A DIFFERENCE\n\nNew Mexico was outscored 99-26 in its previous two games to Fresno State and Utah State.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nThe win keeps alive San Diego State's drive to reach win 10 wins for a fourth straight season, which would be a program record. Only six other schools have accomplished that feat, all from the Power 5 conferences.\n\nNew Mexico's loss means it needs to sweep its final three games to become bowl eligible for the third time in four seasons.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSan Diego State is at home Nov. 10 to meet UNLV, which is in last place in the conference's West Division.\n\nNew Mexico plays at Air Force on Nov. 10. The loser of that game will drop into sole possession of last place in the Mountain Division.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

However, on the final play, Tyson Maeva and Scale Igiehon combined for a sack on Wilson, preserving the victory.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nBYU: Despite supplanting senior Tanner Mangum as the starter three weeks ago, freshman quarterback Zach Wilson hasn't exactly jumpstarted the Cougars' offense. After piling up 474 yards and 45 points against the porous Hawaii defense, Wilson has struggled in back-to-back games against a pair of FBS teams in the top 50 in total defense. However, he continued to show his running prowess, breaking off a run of 20-plus yards for the third time in his last four games.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos continue to struggle to put away opponents, which is an area of concern heading into the final stretch of the season. If Boise State hopes to defend its Mountain West title, the Broncos will need to be more effective running the ball late in the fourth quarter to put away stronger opponents like Fresno State and Utah State.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBYU: The Cougars travel to UMass next Saturday.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos will host Fresno State on Friday in a game that will have major implications on the Mountain West Conference championship.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Timothy J. Gonzalez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Southern California coach Clay Helton said his offensive line wanted to control the game. And there's no question they opened up massive holes, for which Helton was thankful in his first time this season handling play calling duties for the Trojans.\n\n\"It's so easy as a play caller when the run is going, because it sets up so many other opportunities. . It set up our explosive plays and over 500 yards of offense,\" Helton added.\n\nAca'Cedric Ware rushed for 205 yards and three touchdowns, including 57-yard and 62-yard scoring sprints, as Southern California beat Oregon State 38-21 on Saturday night.\n\n\"The o-line, they did their thing today. Every time the running game is going good, it's because of them,\" Ware said.\n\nJT Daniels threw for 177 yards and a touchdown and Vavae Malepeai added 101 yards rushing for the Trojans (5-4, 4-3 Pac-12), who snapped a two-game losing streak.\n\nJake Luton went 31-for-45 for 301 yards and a touchdown and Isaiah Hodgins had 129 yards receiving for the Beavers (2-7, 1-5).\n\n\"We just didn't have enough tonight,\" Oregon State coach Jonathan Smith said.\n\nSouthern California stormed out to a 21-0 lead thanks in part to a grinding 17-play first drive and a lightning strike 57-yarder from Ware on the Trojans' second possession.\n\nBut Oregon State recovered and trailed 21-14 at the half. The Beavers' second touchdown, an 11-yard catch by Noah Togiai with four seconds before the break, capped an 85-yard drive that lasted just 67 seconds.\n\nSouthern California opened the second half with a drive that led to a 2-yard Ware touchdown, but Oregon State responded with its own touchdown run by Artavis Pierce.\n\nWith 11:53 remaining, Ware uncorked his 62-yarder to make the score 35-21.\n\nDaniels suffered a concussion two weeks ago versus Utah and returned as the Southern California starter on Saturday.\n\nLuton returned as the starter for Oregon State after missing four weeks with an ankle injury. Last week, he came in during the second half against Colorado and passed for 310 yards and three touchdowns and was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSouthern California: Helton, a former offensive coordinator for the Trojans, took over play calling duties and fired the offensive line coach after last week's loss. The offense looked particularly crisp to open the game and at the start of the second half. . Southern California averaged 7.5 yards per carry against the Beavers defense. . Just one more win makes Southern California bowl eligible.\n\nOregon State: The Trojans looked determined to stuff the run, but with Luton back behind center, the Beavers are a different team. Oregon State's remaining schedule appears brutal, but if Luton can stay healthy, things look somewhat brighter.\n\nWIDE OPEN SOUTH: The Pac-12 South leaders - Southern California, Utah, Arizona and Arizona State - all have three losses. \"We put ourselves back in position. The south is wide open,\" Helton said.\n\nFUN TIMES: Helton said that the Trojans showed poise and players were feeding off each other's energy. \"It was cool to look up and see them dancing at the beginning of the fourth quarter. There was a lot of fun. And in that locker room, we let out a huge scream, all together, just letting out a bunch of frustration,\" Helton added.\n\nSLOW STARTS: Smith noted Oregon State's trend of slow starts. \"It's not a lack of effort. I don't think it's a lack of focus. For whatever reason, we haven't scored first in games,\" he added. The Beavers' opponents have scored first in every Pac-12 game this season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouthern California hosts California on Nov. 10.\n\nOregon State plays at Stanford on Nov. 10.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Kings accomplished something they haven't done much during the first month of the season \u2014 play a complete game.\n\nThe Kings got just their second win in the last nine games as they defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-1 on Saturday night.\n\n\"Like the way we came out and played,\" Los Angeles coach John Stevens said. \"We played faster with the puck. We also checked faster and had support of the puck when we regained possession.\"\n\nDustin Brown, who had a goal and two assists, thought that playing with the lead \u2014 which the Kings have done rarely this season \u2014 also did wonders.\n\n\"We did exactly what we are known for. They had a lot of puck movement but we kind of bent but didn't break and that was a big part of our success,\" he said. \"We got a lot of traffic in front of the net and pucks there. You are going to get a lot of goals when you get guys there.\"\n\nAlex Iafallo's goal at 12:03 of the first period marked the first time in nine games (Oct. 11 at Montreal) that Los Angeles scored the first goal. It also was the first contest since Oct. 18 against the Islanders (six games) that the Kings scored in the first 20 minutes.\n\n\"It definitely gives you a spark. We played the right way defensively and that led to a really strong offense,\" said goaltender Jack Campbell, who made 26 saves. \"We won a lot of puck battles which eliminated their offensive zone time and shots on goal.\"\n\nAnze Kopitar and Jeff Carter also scored for the Kings, who are 4-0 when scoring three or more goals.\n\nZach Werenski had the Blue Jackets' lone goal and Sergei Bobrovsky made 25 saves.\n\nThe Kings led 2-1 in the third period when they put the game away with a pair of short-handed goals 57 seconds apart. Kopitar got his own rebound and went top shelf on Sergei Bobrovsky at 7:46 for the right wing's fourth goal of the season. Brown put it away less than a minute later on a penalty shot, for his second. The penalty shot, which was Los Angeles' first, was the result of Ryan Murray hooking Brown on the breakaway attempt.\n\n\"We've been inconsistent, quite honestly,\" Columbus coach John Tortorella said. \"You get the game straightened out and find a way to crawl back into it and we just didn't pull up on our power play.\"\n\nIafallo put Los Angeles on the board first with his third. The left wing's shot from the left faceoff circle trickled underneath Bobrovsky's pads. It is the first time in six games (Oct. 18 against the Islanders) the Kings scored in the first period.\n\nThe Kings went up by two on a power-play goal in the second period when Carter took a cross-ice pass from Ilya Kovalchuk and fired a wrist shot for his fourth.\n\nWerenski scored for Columbus 29 seconds into the third when he beat Campbell after getting a centering pass from Boone Jenner.\n\nNOTES: Kovalchuk has two goals and four assists over the past three games. ... Kopitar also extended his point streak to three straight and has a goal and two assists in that span. ... Los Angeles' Matt Luff made his NHL debut. The 21-year old right wing was on the third line. He is the first player in franchise history to wear number 64. ... Columbus has scored a goal in the first period in 10 straight games.

(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCALGARY, Alberta (AP) \u2014 The Calgary Flames stuck to an unconventional winning formula on Saturday night.\n\nSean Monahan, Michael Frolik and Mikael Backlund scored in the third period, and the Flames again rallied for a 5-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday night.\n\nMonahan finished with two goals and Matthew Tkachuk also scored as Calgary got its fifth win this season when trailing after two periods.\n\n\"Obviously it's not ideal to be down in games like we have been,\" said Flames centre Sean Monahan, who had two goals to extend his point streak to six games (4 goals, 6 assists). \"But we had a lot of good looks and if you play the same way we're playing, you're going to get rewarded and that's what happened tonight.\"\n\nAnaheim (two) is the only other NHL team with more than one win when behind after 40 minutes.\n\nDavid Rittich had 12 saves to help the Flames win their fourth straight.\n\nJonathan Toews got his 300th career goal, and Jan Rutta and Brandon Saad also scored for the Blackhawks, who went 0-3-0 on a three-game trip to Western Canada. Corey Crawford stopped 36 shots, including 18 of the 20 he faced in the third period.\n\n\"They just put so much pressure,\" Crawford said. \"They kept coming. A lot of speed. They were making plays. They had a lot of confidence there in the third.\"\n\nWith Calgary trailing 3-1, Tkachuk started the comeback with 1:34 left in the second.\n\n\"We had been the better team so far in the game, we had chances and chances, and we knew we were going to get one,\" Tkachuk said.\n\nAfter pressing all period, Monahan finally tied it with 6:01 left in the third, when he neatly converted a cross-ice pass off the rush from Johnny Gaudreau. Monahan extended his point streak to six games (four goals, six assists).\n\nFrolik put Calgary ahead for good with 4:55 left as his centering pass from below the goal line deflected off a player and got past Crawford. It was the seventh goal for Frolik, who scored only 10 times last year.\n\n\"He passed it out front and I put my stick out and one of our guys put out his stick and I didn't see where it went after that,\" Crawford said.\n\nBacklund capped the scoring with an empty-netter with 59 seconds left.\n\nCalgary's top unit of Monahan, Gaudreau and Elias Lindholm were the best line all night.\n\n\"They were real good,\" Flames coach Bill Peters saod. \"Johnny had the pucks lots, (Lindholm) had unbelievable looks, (Monahan) ended up with a pair, and at the end of the day, they were playing against real good players.\"\n\nThe Flames outshot Chicago 41-15, including 20-4 in the third period.\n\n\"You can't give up that many chances in the third and expect to come out with a win,\" Saad said. \"Yeah, they got a lucky bounce on that fourth goal there, but they created their own luck. They were working hard. They had the puck possession. We fell into a shell.\"\n\nCalgary opened the scoring 4:46 in when a quick passing sequence was finished off by Monahan in the slot on the power play.\n\nChicago tied it with 6:03 remaining in the period after Travis Hamonic's holding penalty put the Blackhawks on a two-man power play fpr 1:10 and they took advantage on Toews' eighth goal.\n\nThe Blackhawks took their first lead with 27 seconds left in the first as Rutta faked a slap shot to elude the sliding Garnet Hathaway, then put a wrist shot through a crowd and past Rittich high on his blocker side.\n\nSaad split the Flames' defense while being harassed from behind by Mark Giordano and sent a shot that squeaked through Rittich's pads to make it 3-1 with 6:19 left in the second.\n\nCalgary took over after that.\n\nNOTES: The Flames got an early five-minute man advantage when Duncan Keith was given a boarding major and game misconduct just over two minutes in, when his hit from behind on Dillon Dube sent the rookie head first into the boards.

Some fans in the crowd booed Cormier for dominating Lewis with his ground game \u2013 perhaps hoping to see Lewis land another stunning knockout blow \u2013 but the Black Beast never managed to land any power punches.\n\nAfter the fight, Joe Rogan asked Cormier what he thought about a potential showdown with 41-year-old Brock Lesnar. The WWE superstar showed up to confront Cormier at UFC 226 back in July, and a Cormier-Lesnar main event has the potential to be a major draw for UFC. Cormier just has one condition:\n\n\u201cBrock Lesnar\u2026 when you come, bring that brand new WWE title too. I feel like being a WWE Champion too. Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go Brock. Bring that belt with you if you come to my house.\u201d\n\nLesnar became the WWE Universal Champion last Friday at the Crown Jewel pay-per-view, and given the fact that Lesnar isn\u2019t likely to defend his title any time soon, he could still be a WWE champion by the time a fight with Cormier materializes. Lesnar is still serving a suspension imposed by USADA until January of 2019.", "Daniel Cormier (red gloves) celebrates after beating Derrick Lewis (blue gloves) during UFC 230 at Madison Square Garden.

Murray, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe double champ\u2019s first UFC heavyweight title defense couldn\u2019t have gone any more according to plan if he\u2019d scripted it out with help from his opponent.\n\nDaniel Cormier took Derrick Lewis down, roughed him up on the mat, then locked him in a rear-naked choke to force the submission finish midway through the second round. What\u2019s more, Cormier hardly took any damage in the process, using his wrestling to nullify Lewis\u2019 power before exploiting his weaknesses on the mat to get the submission at the 2:14 mark of Round 2.\n\nThe bout served as the main event of UFC 230 from Madison Square Garden in New York City. The main card aired on pay-per-view, with prelims on FS1 and UFC Fight Pass.\n\nCormier\u2019s strategy in the fight was more or less exactly what most people expected, and the challenger Lewis proved unable to do a single thing to stop it.\n\nAfter fending off some early attempts at strikes and even a head kick from Lewis, Cormier nabbed a takedown with relative ease up against the fence, then spent most of the round softening Lewis up with strikes on the mat or putting him back down after he worked to get up.\n\nThis did not appear to fluster Lewis, who had to expect that Cormier would look to put his wrestling to work. But as the fight entered the second frame the takedowns only came easier as Lewis found less and less room to open up with his powerful punches.\n\nAfter trying for a single-leg early in the second, Cormier kicked Lewis\u2019 standing leg out from under him, dropping him to a seated position with a thud. Lewis scrambled to get up, only to get ankle-picked from a front headlock position by the agile Cormier, who again seized an advantageous position on top.\n\nAs soon as Lewis exposed his back in an effort to get up again, Cormier pounced, snatching Lewis\u2019 neck in a rear-naked choke and squeezing for the finish.\n\nThe win brings Cormier his first title defense as UFC heavyweight champion, and his third straight victory since a no-contest with Jon Jones at UFC 214 last July.

(AP Photo/Craig Mitchelldyer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 It took LeBron James to help the Los Angeles Lakers snap a lengthy losing streak against Portland.\n\nJames had 28 points and seven assists and the Lakers defeated the Trail Blazers 114-110 Saturday night.\n\nThe Lakers snapped the franchise's 16-game losing streak against the Blazers. In addition to the streak, Saturday was the Lakers' first road win this season against a team with a winning record.\n\n\"Great to snap that,\" James said of the Lakers' streak of futility against Portland. \"They're a very good team, obviously. To beat Portland, you can't just come in and win without playing really hard and really well.\"\n\nRajon Rondo gave the Lakers a huge lift off the bench, finishing with 17 points and 10 assists in 25 minutes.\n\nDamian Lillard and CJ McCollum each scored 30 points for Portland.\n\nThe Lakers used a 16-0 run in the third quarter to take a 17-point lead.

And tonight he saved us and covered our defensive mistakes with blocks at the rim.\"\n\nPortland shot a 6 for 35 (17 percent) from beyond the arc and shot just 42 percent from the field overall.\n\n\"Our defense won us the game tonight,\" Walton said. \"They missed some 3s, but we were contesting, chasing over the top and defending.\"\n\nThe Lakers had seven turnovers in the fourth quarter and finished with 20 overall, but they survived their mistakes.\n\nThe Lakers sped to a good start, but the Blazers quickly regained control. Turnovers and second chances fueled a 17-2 run by Portland in the first quarter.\n\nThe Lakers bench helped get Los Angeles back into the game in the first half and outscored the Blazers subs 51-26.\n\n\"Our second unit was outstanding tonight,\" Walton said. \"Rondo led it and then the lift that (Ivica) Zubac gave us off the bench was incredible.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTrail Blazers: Blazers head coach Terry Stotts says it's hard to get a handle for where his team really is on the defensive end due to the league's uptick in pace and scoring so far this season.\n\n\"It's hard to get a handle around the league where defense is,\" Stotts said. \"The numbers say we're 11th but it doesn't feel like it, but we are.

Stotts coached Chandler in Dallas in 2011.\n\n\"I like Tyson Chandler,\" Stotts said. \"Great teammate, obviously that was a few years ago but he impacts the game at the defensive end.

(AP Photo/Isaac Brekken) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 After losing both games on a road trip, Vegas coach Gerard Gallant called a team meeting when the Golden Knights returned home.\n\nThe goal was to get the defending Western Conference champs back on the same page with one another, reminding them what they're capable of after reaching last year's Stanley Cup Final.\n\nThey responded Saturday night.\n\nMarc-Andre Fleury got his 50th career shutout, Brad Hunt and William Carrier scored their first goals of the season, and Vegas beat the Carolina Hurricanes 3-0.\n\n\"I thought (the meeting) was good, just to remind ourselves of what we have to do and who we are and how we have to play consistently,\" Fleury said. \"He didn't go out there yelling at everybody, just straightforward, just honest, just making sure we simplify our game. That's how we've had success before, and tonight we didn't do anything fancy. But we played hard all game and it paid off.\"\n\nFleury, who earlier this season moved into 10th place on the all-time list for victories, stopped 34 shots. The 15-year veteran now has 410 wins, and is the 29th goaltender in NHL history to record 50 shutouts.\n\nRyan Reaves equaled his goal tally from last season by scoring his fourth for the Golden Knights.\n\n\"I thought we played our game tonight, and that's what we were worried about,\" Gallant said. \"We're trying to play a 60-minute game, and we're trying to compete and battle hard and get back to the things that make us successful and I think tonight we did that.\"\n\nHurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said prior to the game he likes his team feeding off the adrenaline of playing back-to-back nights, but Carolina is now 1-2 on the second of consecutive games.\n\nAfter sitting out Friday's 4-3 overtime loss in Arizona, goaltender Scott Darling made 22 saves for the Hurricanes, who never found a rhythm offensively and continued their dismal power play. Carolina, which came in with the worst power play in the NHL, was 0 for 3 with a man advantage. The Hurricanes are now 6 for 51 this season.\n\nSince opening the season 4-0-1, the Hurricanes are on a 2-6-2 slide, during which they've scored 17 goals after scoring 22 in their first five games.\n\n\"Tonight was probably the game I didn't like the most out of all of them, but even saying that, it was a grind game,\" Brind'Amour said. \"We gotta start finding ways to put the puck in the net, and that's been the challenge here.\"\n\nCarolina's closest chance at a goal came midway through the third, but Justin Williams gloved the puck in after it hit the crossbar, resulting in a no goal. Moments later, on a power play, Michael Ferland's wrist shot clanked off the goal post.\n\n\"They had a lot of shots on net, but they get a lot of shots every night, they put pucks to the net and they go hard to the net,\" Gallant said of the Hurricanes. \"They got a real good team over there.\"\n\nWhile Erik Haula has a point in four of the last six games and has two assists in a game six times this season, the positivity from Gallant's words in the closed-door meeting were contagious enough to spark fourth-liners Reaves and Carrier, and Hunt, a consistent healthy scratch who was playing in only his fifth game this season.\n\n\"When we're winning hockey games those guys are a big part of our group and it's good to see them get rewarded tonight,\" Gallant said. \"I know our players are real happy with those guys putting the puck in the night.\"\n\nHunt opened the scoring after getting Haula's perfectly placed pass and burying it past Darling.\n\nReaves found the back of the net with a backhand that slipped under Darling's pads to extend Vegas' lead to 2-0 early in the second period. Reaves, who scored a career-high seven goals during the 2016-17 season, while playing for St. Louis, is on pace to score 23 goals this season.\n\nFinally, after a forecheck created a turnover in Carolina's zone, Carrier was able to punch the rebound past Darling through the five hole to give Vegas a 3-0 lead.\n\nNOTES: Vegas D Colin Miller played in his 199th career game. ... Shea Theodore extended his point streak to three straight games. ... Carrier's and Reaves' goals gives the fourth line seven goals this season. ...

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Myles Gaskin sat as a spectator for two straight games with Washington knowing it would need it senior running back when Stanford rolled into town.\n\nThe Huskies ended up leaning on Gaskin perhaps more than they expected.\n\n\"There's no way to put into words because that guy is unbelievable,\" Washington quarterback Jake Browning said. \"When us two are back there I feel really good.\"\n\nGaskin returned after missing two games due to a shoulder injury to rush for a season-high 148 yards and one touchdown, and Washington built a big early lead before needing Taylor Rapp's interception on the final play to beat Stanford 27-23 on Saturday night.\n\nThe matchup was essentially an elimination game in the Pac-12 North Division race and the Huskies got their senior star ball carrier back on the field just in time. Gaskin sat out a win over Colorado and loss to California, and his absence only highlighted his importance to Washington's offense.\n\n\"He's the best at hiding behind his guys, letting things develop and getting to the right spot,\" Washington coach Chris Petersen said.\n\nGaskin and Browning were the foundation of the Huskies (7-3, 5-2 Pac-12) building a 21-0 lead, scoring on their first three possessions. Browning ran for a 2-yard touchdown , threw an 11-yard TD pass to Drew Sample, and Gaskin's 6-yard run early in the second quarter capped the scoring blitz.\n\nBut the Huskies offense became conservative and was unable to find the end zone the rest of the way, making for a nervy second half after Stanford's K.J. Costello got hot.\n\n\"When things are tough and things are dark and it's us against the world, we are at our absolute best. I love that about our guys,\" Stanford coach David Shaw said. \"The problem is we create the situation that puts us there.

Riccitelli missed the extra point and the Huskies lead was 27-23.\n\nThe missed extra point ended up being a big moment.\n\nWashington was only able to run 79 seconds off the clock before punting and Stanford took possession at its 15 with 2:05 left. Instead of a field goal being enough, the Cardinal needed a touchdown because of the missed extra point.\n\nCostello hit five passes to get to the Washington 34 with 10 seconds left. He missed an end zone throw for Irwin and on the last play Costello was intercepted by Rapp at the goal line.\n\nCostello was 29 of 43 for 347 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions. Love rushed 18 times for 71 yards.\n\n\"This one really hit me in terms of 'man, we've had the feeling a lot in the last month.' It's a very similar feeling and it's a feeling that nobody wants to have. I don't wish upon anybody,\" Costello said.\n\nBrowning finished 16 of 27 for 194 yards and one score.\n\nSTARTING OFF\n\nWashington's first quarter and most of the first half was nearly flawless. The Huskies scored touchdowns on their first three drives. They picked off Costello twice, including a diving interception by 320-pound defensive tackle Greg Gaines off a pass deflected by Ben Burr-Kirven. Stanford failed to get a first down in the first quarter and had just 96 yards of offense until the final drive of the half.\n\nINJURIES\n\nStanford played the final 2 \u00bd quarters without leading receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside after he left midway through the second quarter with a right ankle/foot injury. Arcega-Whiteside was held without a catch until grabbing a pass from Costello with 5:24 left in the first half. Arcega-Whiteside appeared to be injured while being tackled and left the field with help from trainers.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nStanford: The Cardinal remained winless this season when not forcing a turnover. ... Stanford has lost four regular season games in consecutive seasons for the first time since the 2008-09 seasons.\n\nWashington: The Huskies still have a path to the Rose Bowl in their control.

(AP) \u2014 It's rare that Florida, Florida State and Miami lose on the same day.\n\nBut all three losing on consecutive weekends?\n\nThat's never happened \u2014 until now.\n\nThe \"Big Three\" of Sunshine State football are struggling simultaneously right now, in historic fashion. Florida lost to Missouri 38-17 on Saturday, Florida State fell against North Carolina State 47-28 and Miami lost to Duke 20-12, a trio of defeats that marked only the third day in the last 40 years where all three played and lost.\n\nLosing on the same day also happened on Oct. 30, 2004 and Oct. 8, 2011 \u2014 it didn't happen last weekend because Miami lost to Boston College on Friday night, before Florida lost to Georgia on Saturday and Florida State lost 59-10 to Clemson. Take away the 2004, 2011 and 2018 debacles, and the most recent instance of Florida, Florida State and Miami losing on the same day was Oct. 14, 1978.\n\n\"We didn't play very well, at all,\" Florida coach Dan Mullen said Saturday.\n\nHe was speaking of his own team, of course.\n\nBut the same would have applied to the Seminoles and Hurricanes. His counterparts \u2014 Florida State's Willie Taggart and Miami's Mark Richt \u2014 had no choice but to offer similar sentiments about their own clubs as a woeful Sunshine State Saturday dragged to a close.\n\nThe Seminoles are 4-5 and in danger of missing a bowl after their loss.\n\n\"Our guys know how to play football,\" Taggart said. \"We've got to teach them how to win.\"\n\nMiami's reign as the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coastal Division champion is almost certainly over, with the Hurricanes falling to 5-4 overall and 2-3 in league play after their third consecutive loss.\n\n\"I don't have a lot of really good answers, right this minute,\" Richt said. \"I'm sure you all have a bunch of questions. It's just heartbreaking to not be able to get the victory. We put a lot into it and didn't get it done.\"\n\nMiami's last win was against Florida State, four weeks ago.\n\n\"I think we're working hard,\" Miami safety Jaquan Johnson said. \"I think we just need to execute better. We start executing better, I think things will start going our way.\"\n\nIt doesn't get exactly easier for the three storied Florida programs. Florida State plays Notre Dame next weekend, Miami goes to Georgia Tech and Florida meets former coach Will Muschamp and South Carolina.\n\nAnd the NFL teams aren't exactly helping the mood of disgruntled fans around the state: All three of Florida's pro clubs lost last week as well, with the Miami Dolphins losing in a Thursday night matchup on Oct. 25 and the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers falling last Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Brad Tollefson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) \u2014 Kyler Murray kept slinging it and running it after two quick interceptions put No. 7 Oklahoma in a two-touchdown hole.\n\nTexas Tech's Alan Bowman didn't get a chance to finish the duel in the second half because of a recurrence of the partially collapsed lung that sidelined the freshman quarterback five weeks ago.\n\nMurray recovered from those early picks by throwing for 360 yards and three touchdowns and running for 100 yards and another score to rally the Sooners to a 51-46 victory over the Red Raiders on Saturday night.\n\nTrey Sermon set career highs with 206 yards rushing and three TDs, including a clinching 30-yarder , as the Sooners (8-1, 5-1 Big 12) stayed in the hunt for a return to the College Football Playoff with their 19th straight win in a true road game and 14th consecutive November victory.\n\nOklahoma, which was seventh in the first playoff rankings released this past week, handed the Red Raiders (5-4, 3-3) their eighth straight loss against a Top 10 team going back to 2012.\n\n\"Well, what was I thinking?\" Murray said, repeating part of the question after going 20 of 35 passing without another turnover after the two quick ones.\n\n\"After the first one, just don't do it again. And then I did it again. And then it was just, I mean, you have kind of got to know me. I'm cool, calm, and that's the only way to be after you do something like that.\"\n\nThe Red Raiders led 31-28 at halftime, but Bowman didn't return and ended up in a Lubbock hospital, just as he did Sept. 29 when he first sustained the lung injury in a loss to West Virginia.\n\nBowman, who the school said would be held overnight for observation, returned two weeks ago against Kansas. Coach Kliff Kingsbury said Bowman re-injured the lung on a run near the goal line late in the first half.\n\nThe Big 12 passing leader's absence changed the flow of a game that was looking a lot like the 65-59 touchdown fest the Sooners won in Lubbock two years ago.\n\nTexas Tech punted three straight times without getting a first down after Jett Duffey replaced Bowman again, just as he did against the Mountaineers.\n\nBut Duffey did get the Red Raiders moving again, and they pulled within two on his 4-yard scoring pass to Zach Austin on fourth down midway through the fourth quarter. But Robert Barnes intercepted the 2-point conversion pass and returned it 98 yards for two points and a 44-40 OU lead.\n\n\"I should have found a way to get him more comfortable at the start of the second half than I did,\" Kingsbury said. \"Once he got in a rhythm and he was competing and doing his deal, he played really well.\"\n\nBoth of Murray's interceptions were by Vaughnte Dorsey, on his first throw of the game and again on OU's second possession.\n\nBowman threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to T.J. Vasher after the Red Raiders got the ball on the Oklahoma 3 following Dorsey's 17-yard return on the first interception .\n\nAfter a 31-yard return on Dorsey's second pick , Duffey came on as change of pace replacement for Bowman and threw a screen that Ta'Zhawn Henry took 14 yards for a 14-0 lead.\n\nMurray bounced back to lead the Sooners to 687 total yards in what figures to be his only chance to match Mayfield's run to the four-team playoff last season since the junior is expected to pursue pro baseball after one year as OU's starter.\n\n\"Sometimes a guy can get a little gun shy when you have a start like that,\" said Lincoln Riley, who was on the sidelines at his alma mater for the first time since replacing Bob Stoops. \"And he wasn't. He kept flinging. He ran the ball well.\"\n\nLee Morris caught two of Murray's TDs, the second a 46-yarder that put the Sooners ahead for good 35-31 in the third quarter. Morris had 101 yards receiving. Texas Tech's Antoine Wesley caught 12 passes for 199 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOklahoma: The Sooners gave up more than 300 yards for the first time in three games since former Texas Tech assistant Ruffin McNeill replaced the fired Mike Stoops as defensive coordinator. It's hard to gauge the progress of the unit because of Bowman's injury. The Red Raiders finished with 473 total yards.\n\nTexas Tech: The Red Raiders will wonder what might have been if Bowman had been able to return in the second half. He was 21 of 26 for 227 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. Still, Duffey showed persistence similar to first time Bowman was injured. He threw for two scores and ran for one that gave Texas Tech a shot at an onside kick with 1:05 remaining. It failed.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nOU could move up a spot because of No. 4 LSU's shutout loss to top-ranked Alabama. The rest of the teams ahead of the Sooners won impressively and the two teams behind them had closer-than-expected victories.\n\n30-YARD MARCH-OFF\n\nReceiver CeeDee Lamb stopped Oklahoma's momentum when he was called for a personal foul and unsportsmanlike conduct after catching a pass for a first down at the Texas Tech 7. The 30 yards in penalties led to a punt when the Sooners were on the verge of a second straight touchdown drive and their first double-digit lead in the third quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOklahoma: Bedlam is at home against Oklahoma State next Saturday.\n\nTexas Tech: Another big home game against No. 15 Texas next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

When she rejected him, he cracked, \"0 for 3,\" referencing his broken engagement with Grande and past attempts at love.\n\nGrande didn't think the joke was very funny, slamming Davidson in several since-deleted tweets. \"For somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh,\" she wrote. \"Thank u, next.\"\n\n\"SNL\" snuck in a reference to Davidson in host Jonah Hill's opening monologue, in which Hill visited Tina Fey, Drew Barrymore and Candice Bergen in the \"Five-Timers' Club\" lounge.\n\nBergen requested \u201canother Pete Davidson\" cocktail from Kenan Thompson, going on to explaining the drink as, \u201cAll I know is it\u2019s got a lot going on, but it still gets the job done.\u201d\n\nMore 'SNL': Pete Davidson slammed for mocking Republican candidate who lost his eye in war\n\nRelated: 'Saturday Night Live' jokes about Alec Baldwin's arrest after his Trump is a no-show\n\nDavidson went on to directly address his breakup with Grande during a segment on \"Weekend Update,\" in which he praised his ex and asked viewers to respect their privacy.\n\n\"The last thing I will say is, I know some of you are curious about the breakup, but the truth is, it's nobody's business, and sometimes things just don't work out and that's OK,\" he said. \"She's a wonderful, strong person and I wish her all the happiness in the world.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/04/ariana-grandes-thank-u-next-single-pete-davidson-mac-miller/1882680002/", "CLOSE Recapping the top moments from college football's Week 10 action, which include Michigan housing Penn State and much more. USA TODAY\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide defensive lineman Quinnen Williams (92) wraps up LSU Tigers quarterback Joe Burrow (9) for a sack during the third quarter at Tiger Stadium. (Photo: John David Mercer, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nEleven takeaways from Week 10 of the college football season:\n\nMore of the same for Alabama-LSU: For all the hype about how different this Alabama team is offensively (and it\u2019s all deserved), Saturday\u2019s 29-0 win didn\u2019t look all that different from the last few renditions of this rivalry. If Alabama was the ultimate measuring stick for whether LSU has fixed its offense, the answer was delivered in resounding fashion. Because LSU couldn\u2019t move the ball \u2014 again \u2014 the Crimson Tide basically had this thing on cruise control pretty early. Even when the game was just 9-0 early on, it was only superficially competitive because the LSU offense didn\u2019t present much of a threat to either make big plays or sustain drives.\n\nIf nothing else, LSU proved that Alabama isn\u2019t going to score 50 easy points every time out against quality teams. But that doesn\u2019t matter if you can only muster 196 yards of offense, and that was the whole ballgame.\n\nIn reality, only two relevant pieces of news came out of this game: One is that LSU is eliminated from any playoff consideration. That means the SEC\u2019s only real hope of getting two teams into the field would be for Georgia to beat Alabama in the SEC championship game.\n\nSecond, Tua Tagovailoa sure seemed to be grabbing at that right knee an awful lot after having to manage a sprain the last few weeks. Tagovailoa was able to play \u2014 he even took his first snaps of a fourth quarter this season \u2014 but obviously you don\u2019t want him to be hobbling around out there as we get into the championship part of the schedule. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a huge concern, but it\u2019s something to watch.\n\nMore: No. 1 Alabama dominates with shutout of No. 4 LSU to lock up SEC West title\n\nMichigan moving up: For the last few weeks, a consensus has formed around the idea that Clemson is a clear No. 2 with a big gap to whichever team you prefer at No. 3. But Michigan deserves some consideration to be right there with Clemson based on the way the Wolverines have played recently. Saturday\u2019s 42-7 win over Penn State was another defensive masterclass, limiting a very dangerous offense to 186 yards after holding Michigan State to 94 and Wisconsin to 283 yards (75 of which came on the final drive in garbage time) its previous two weeks. Michigan is the best defense in the country statistically by a pretty good margin (220 yards against per game coming into this weekend), and its offense continues to improve as quarterback Shea Patterson looks more comfortable in his first year with the program.\n\nMore: Michigan is now clear favorite to win Big Ten. Anything else a letdown\n\nBy this point, Michigan\u2019s season-opening 24-17 loss at Notre Dame was a long time ago. And while that loss may very well be a deciding factor in how the College Football Playoff selection committee evaluates both Michigan and Notre Dame, it doesn\u2019t seem like a very relevant game in terms of how you evaluate Michigan now.\n\nWhile Notre Dame is also a different team, having made a quarterback change from Brandon Wimbush to Ian Book, it took Michigan a few weeks to figure out its identity, especially with Patterson just coming into the program via transfer in the spring. Michigan has made up a lot of ground since then, and that is a physical defense with a lot of NFL-type guys who could make things hard for Alabama and Clemson.\n\nThough Michigan will be ranked behind Notre Dame until the Irish lose, if they played again next week on a neutral field, I would pick Michigan based on the way the two teams look right now.\n\nMore: No. 3 Notre Dame survives Northwestern's upset bid\n\nDana Holgorsen has brass ones: It\u2019s been hours, and I still can\u2019t believe that with a shot at the Big 12 title game (and a potential playoff bid) hanging in the balance, Holgo went for two with 16 seconds left at Texas and came out of it with a 42-41 win.\n\n\u201cThat was an easy decision when you have (No.) 7 at quarterback (Will Grier) and (No.) 13 at wideout (David Sills),\u201d Holgorsen said in a post-game interview on Fox. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saving that one. We\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in it.\u201d\n\nAfter West Virginia burned two different formations on the two-pointer before timeouts (one called by each team), the third different play was actually pretty simple: Grier dropping back, waiting for Texas\u2019 defense to overcommit to the right side of the field, then waltzing into the end zone going left.\n\nStill, given everything that was on the line, it was a gutsy decision by Holgorsen to try to win it right there rather than play for overtime. If you don\u2019t make it, Texas probably winds up in the Big 12 title game while you're at home. But give Holgorsen credit for staying true to who he is.\n\nMore: Will Grier and No. 10 West Virginia stun No. 15 Texas in final seconds\n\nBig 12 could cannibalize itself out of the playoff: When the Big 12 added a championship game before last season, we knew it would be a guaranteed regular season rematch since the 10-team league plays a round-robin schedule. We also knew it was possible that the same teams would play two weeks in a row. And now that appears likely to happen with West Virginia and Oklahoma, which will play the night after Thanksgiving in Morgantown, then probably again eight days later in Arlington, Texas. Since both teams already have a loss, that means one of them is guaranteed to be a two-loss team on Nov. 23. And if the loser of the first meeting turns the tables in the championship game, that will all but eliminate the Big 12 from the playoff. The irony, of course, is that the Big 12 changed the schedule to prevent a double dose of Bedlam, as Oklahoma and Oklahoma State had played for the conference title on the final weekend of the regular season two straight years. No matter what the Big 12 does, it just can\u2019t game the system.\n\nSomething to think about: James Franklin isn\u2019t on the hot seat or anywhere near it right now, but if I were advising him about the next part of his career, I would suggest this might be a good time to take a look around if a top-level job (like, perhaps, Southern Cal) opens up. For all the success Franklin has had at Penn State, he\u2019s not yet reached the level where he can sustain two disappointing seasons in a row without feeling the heat. And that\u2019s something to consider if the last five weeks at Penn State are a harbinger for next year \u2014 when things may very well get tougher with quarterback Trace McSorley moving on. Penn State was absolutely taken apart Saturday by Michigan, continuing a meltdown that started percolating when the Nittany Lions blew it against Ohio State (for the second year in a row), couldn\u2019t recover enough to beat Michigan State and scratched together some very fortunate wins over Indiana and Iowa.\n\nThat may not be fair coming off back-to-back top 10 finishes, including a Big Ten title, but Franklin does get some (well-deserved) criticism from the Penn State fan base for his game management snafus and a string of close losses the last couple years against the Big Ten heavyweights, one of which absolutely cost the Nittany Lions a playoff spot last year. There are also some statistics (like 0-11 in road games against ranked teams) that are starting to pile up against him. Still, you\u2019d rather have Franklin running your program than not. For now.\n\nBut just ask Gus Malzahn how well that insulates you when you hit a rough patch.\n\nMore: College football's winners and losers for Week 10 topped by West Virginia's bold gamble\n\nGeorgia headed to Atlanta: The Bulldogs became the first team in any conference to wrap up a division title this season, clinching the SEC East via a routine 34-17 win in Lexington. Though Kentucky has been a great story, the difference in talent between the two programs really became apparent on this kind of stage. The only way Georgia might have been susceptible was if it suffered from any sort of hangover after the big win in the \u201cCocktail Party\u201d game over Florida. But the Bulldogs broke out offensively with 331 rushing yards against what had been a terrific front seven to deflate any hint of drama. We\u2019ll see if the Bulldogs can get up emotionally for a third straight week when Auburn goes to Athens next Saturday.\n\nMore: No. 5 Georgia runs past No. 12 Kentucky for SEC East title\n\nIf Clemson gets a test before the playoff, it'll be next weekend: Raise your hand if before the season you pegged the Tigers' trip to Boston College as their biggest hurdle for an ACC title. Though Clemson's systems have been fully engaged for several weeks now (the Tigers did as they pleased in a 77-16 dissection of Louisville), Boston College added another nice win on Saturday, beating Virginia Tech 31-21 in Blacksburg. The Eagles are 7-2 and are really good at running the football and should at least be able to prevent Clemson from snoozing through the entire ACC schedule. In fact, if the Eagles somehow sprung the upset, they'd actually have the tiebreaker over Clemson for the ACC Atlantic Division title. Given how many teams are still alive for playoff bids, the Tigers would be well-served not to stub their toe here.\n\nWhy did ESPN apologize?: Publicly apologizing to the SEC for political commentator James Carville's appearance on College GameDay was not just unnecessary, it should be considered an embarrassment to all parties involved. First of all, Carville, an LSU fan, has made his feelings about the targeting call on Tigers linebacker Devin White last week well-known. In fact, he pretty much said the same stuff \u2014 suggesting an SEC conspiracy to help Alabama \u2014 earlier in the week on the Paul Finebaum Show. Of course, it\u2019s a ridiculous accusation but it\u2019s not the first time the SEC has heard this theory. In other words, ESPN knew what was coming and had Carville on anyway. So why the apology? No need for a decoder ring here. ESPN and the SEC have a very lucrative relationship both as the primary carrier of television rights and in the SEC Network. And the SEC\u2019s sensitivity to criticism is not exactly a secret, particularly when it comes to the editorial control it exhibits over who and what is on the SEC Network\u2019s airwaves. You\u2019d think the SEC, the conference that isn\u2019t shy about beating its chest over being the biggest and baddest, could handle some criticism or ribbing (and Carville\u2019s was rather mild, to be honest). Instead, everyone in this comes off looking small.\n\nMore: ESPN apologizes for James Carville's comments alleging SEC conspiracy to help Alabama\n\nFlorida State sinking to new lows: It\u2019s quite a commentary on how far the Seminoles have fallen this season that they were getting run off the field again, this time by N.C. State, and it barely registered a reaction on social media. It\u2019s almost always news when a program like Florida State is bad, but the Seminoles now feel irrelevant. They\u2019re too hopeless to notice. It\u2019s not just the losses that are concerning in Willie Taggart\u2019s first year, it\u2019s the nature of them. The Seminoles were barely competitive Saturday in a 47-28 loss to the Wolfpack, and it was fourth time this year they've lost by at least three scores. Florida State will close the season now with three ranked teams (Notre Dame, Boston College and Florida), which means the program's 36-year bowl streak is very likely to be broken.\n\nFlorida might be regressing to the mean: It\u2019s been a solid first season for Dan Mullen, but nobody really expected the Gators to be a top-10 type of team. And they\u2019re not. In the micro view, Missouri 38, Florida 17, is one of the season's most surprising scores because Missouri\u2019s been disappointing most of the year and the Gators have exceeded expectations at 6-2 coming into the game. But when a team plays above its head for an extended period of time, a crash is more than likely coming at some point. The bigger surprise here isn\u2019t that Florida struggled, it\u2019s that Missouri looked really good one week after the heartbreak of a 15-14 loss to Kentucky on a touchdown that occurred following a pass interference penalty in the end zone with 0:00 on the clock. Though Missouri was never likely to make a move this quickly on Barry Odom, an alum who has been there just three season as head coach, this was definitely a well-timed win to quiet some of the murmurs rippling through the fan base.", "SMU running back Ke'Mon Freeman (2) gets past Houston cornerback Isaiah Johnson (14) to score a touchdown during the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Dallas. SMU won 45-31. (AP Photo/Brandon Wade) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 SMU has won only two games against Top 25 teams in the past seven years. Ben Hicks has been a big part of both of those wins against Houston.\n\nHicks threw for 318 yards and four touchdowns as SMU beat No. 17 Houston 45-31 on Saturday night.\n\n\"I feel like it was kind of a similar game, honestly,\" Hicks said. \"Just like two years ago, I was happy to see the smiles on the seniors' faces who had been through so much and were able to kind of feel like they were part of something special. And I feel the same way now as an older guy.\"\n\nThe Mustangs (4-5, 3-2 American) never trailed, jumping out to a 17-0 lead after Hicks threw his second TD, a 17-yarder to Tyler Page less than a minute into the second quarter.\n\nHouston played its first game as a ranked team under second-year coach Major Applewhite.\n\n\"This is really the first time we've left a ballgame all year where we said we've played well on defense, played well on offense and played well on special teams,\" SMU coach Sonny Dykes said. \"And so I think the bar's been set for our guys from a performance standpoint and I feel like we know what we're capable of and I'm excited to see how they respond from here.\"\n\nHicks threw three TDs as a redshirt freshman in the shocker two years ago, when SMU beat the then-No. 11 Cougars 38-16, who then fell all of the way out of the poll.\n\nThe Mustangs are 0-18 against other Top 25 opponents in the past seven years, and had lost six in a row by an average margin of three touchdowns since the 2016 win over Houston.\n\nAfter the Cougars (7-2, 4-1, No. 17 CFP) got within 38-31 on quarterback D'Eriq King's 3-yard touchdown run with 9:34 left, SMU went on a time-consuming 13-play drive that ended with Ke'Mon Freeman's second touchdown run, an 8-yarder with 2:43 left.\n\nThat drive was interrupted for about 90 minutes because of lightning and heavy rain.\n\nFreeman ran 20 times for 107 yards. The Mustangs had 196 yards rushing \u2014 54 more than they had in their last three games combined.\n\nThe Cougars were held to 365 total yards, 205 below their national-leading 571 average coming into the game. They failed to reach 40 points for the first time this season, ending their nation's longest active streak at eight games.\n\n\"Well, No. 1 give credit to SMU,\" Applewhite said. \"You never want to shortchange somebody's effort and how they prepared, and they're playing great football. ... In the first half, we didn't play well, we weren't moving the ball well enough consistently on offense.\"\n\nKing did have at least two passing TDs and a rushing score for the ninth straight game, the longest such streak for an FBS player in the last 20 years. But he ran 12 times for only 31 yards and was 11 of 22 passing for 175 yards a week after his 551 total yards against USF.\n\nSMU sacked King four times after the Cougars had allowed five sacks their first eight games.\n\nHicks completed 28 of 43 passes. Reggie Roberson Jr. (134 yards) and James Proche (90 yards) both had nine catches.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nHouston: While their five-game winning streak was snapped, the Cougars still control their own destiny for getting to the American Athletic Conference championship game.\n\n\"Everything is still ahead of us,\" Applewhite said. \"We're still the same football team we were the last five weeks when we won games, but we have to refocus.\"\n\nSMU: Since starting 0-3 in Dykes' first season, the Mustangs have won four of six. The losses in that span are to still-undefeated UCF and in overtime to one-loss Cincinnati. Hicks has thrown for at least 291 yards in all three games since returning to the starting role after freshman William Brown started three games.\n\nNO OLIVER\n\nHouston played its second consecutive game without standout defensive tackle Ed Oliver because of a bruised right knee. He went through pregame warmups but didn't play.\n\n\"He had been cleared, but still there's a comfort level to be able to play,\" Applewhite said.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nA week after the Cougars went from unranked to 17th, they could conceivably be unranked again. If they stay in the new Top 25 on Sunday, it will in the bottom couple of spots.\n\nQUICK TDs\n\nAfter going down 17-0, Houston scored two touchdowns in 54 seconds. King threw a 50-yard TD to Marquez Stevenson before Gleson Sprewell scooped up an SMU fumble and returned it 24 yards.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHouston is home against Temple next Saturday.\n\nSMU hits the road to play UConn next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Mason Plumlee watched as his 3-pointer swished through the net, and the big man started to shimmy down the court as the Denver bench erupted in celebration.\n\nNo one expected Plumlee to drain one from beyond the arc, but the Nuggets are doing a lot of things nobody expected this season.\n\nGary Harris scored 20 points and Malik Beasley and Plumlee hit key 3-pointers in a fourth-quarter flurry, leading Denver to a 103-88 victory over the Utah Jazz on Saturday night.\n\nThe Nuggets outscored the Jazz 35-15 in the fourth thanks to a gritty defense and Plumlee's first 3-pointer. He had only taken 18 shots from beyond the arc in his five-year career, including one this season. But this time, he drained one in front of his own bench during an 18-0 run.\n\n\"It was the end of the shot clock and we had to get it up so I took it,\" Plumlee said. \"It's funny how it started a run. They took a timeout so I could have more time to have fun.\"\n\nJamal Murray scored 19 for Denver, which won its fourth straight and has won eight of nine games so far.\n\nThe Nuggets' great start is due, in part, to an improved defense that is allowing just 101.9 points a game, almost seven fewer than last season. It's a pace they want to continue throughout the season.\n\n\"We're 8-1 and we have one of the best defenses in the NBA, so why not?\" coach Michael Malone said. \"That's our challenge. Let's not get soft with success.\"\n\nJae Crowder scored 21 points off the bench for Utah, which has lost three straight.\n\nThe Jazz got a scare when guard Donovan Mitchell left the game in the fourth quarter with a left ankle injury. Mitchell, who finished with 16 points, missed Friday night's loss to Memphis with a right hamstring injury. He was helped off favoring his left leg, but returned a few minutes later.\n\n\"I was just being a baby,\" Mitchell said. \"I'm good. I've twisted an ankle before. It's not a great feeling. I don't tape my ankles, so I'll probably start.\"\n\nDenver's Nikola Jokic flirted with a triple-double, but finished three points shy of the mark. He had a season-high 16 assists and 10 rebounds. He finished with seven points and has scored just 11 in the last two games combined, but Denver has won both.\n\nThe Jazz led 77-71 early in the fourth quarter but went cold as Denver took control. Beasley's 3-pointer gave the Nuggets a 79-77 lead and Plumlee beat the shot clock with another 3 that increased the lead to five.\n\nUtah missed seven straight shots during a 24-3 run by Denver that turned a six-point deficit into a 95-80 lead. Denver held the Jazz to four made field goals in the fourth.\n\n\"A lot of effort, man,\" Plumlee said of the defense. \"Schematically we're not doing anything different but the multiple effort's there.\"\n\nThe Jazz shot 40.7 from the field and just 19.4 percent from 3-point range.\n\n\"The score didn't reflect our effort,\" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. \"But ultimately you've got to put the ball in the basket. We weren't able to do that in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nJazz: G Alec Burks missed his third straight game with a chip fracture in his left hand. He has not played in the last four games. ... Favors played 19 minutes despite dealing with left knee soreness. He finished with 12 points.\n\nNuggets: Denver started the 1976-77 season 8-0, the first season it was in the NBA. ... The Nuggets have held four of their opponents to below 100 points. They've won all four games.\n\nHOME SWEET HOME\n\nDenver won 31 games at Pepsi Center last season and is 5-0 at home to start this year. It's a big difference from four seasons ago when the Nuggets finished below 19-22 in Denver.\n\n\"I remember getting booed off the court. Nobody was there and tonight it was a sellout,\" Harris said. \"It shows you how far we've come but we still have a long way to go.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJazz: Host the Toronto Raptors on Monday.\n\nNuggets: Host the Boston Celtics on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Alabama won 29-0. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa looked untethered by the brace on his right knee when he galloped for a 44-yard touchdown.\n\nHe looked unfazed by the first interception he'd thrown all season, responding minutes later with passes of 29 and 25 yards for a two-play scoring drive shortly before halftime.\n\nTagovailoa threw two touchdown passes to go with his long scoring run in what was supposed to be his toughest test this season, Alabama's defense stifled No. 4 LSU, and the top-ranked Crimson Tide remained unbeaten with a 29-0 victory Saturday night.\n\nAlabama (9-0, 6-0 SEC, No. 1 CFP) had no victories over a team currently ranked in the top 20 entering Death Valley. But if there were any questions about the Tide's ability to handle a highly ranked team in a hostile environment, they've been answered resoundingly.\n\n\"We really wanted to make a statement in this game. A lot of people talk about our schedule,\" Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \"What better opportunity is there to make a statement than the circumstance we were in.\"\n\nTagovailoa was 25-of-42 passing for 295 yards and moved as well as he needed to, particularly when he sprinted up the middle of the field or his long TD run in the third quarter to give Alabama a 22-0 lead.\n\nTagovailoa limped off the field after that play, went into the medical tent briefly and rode a stationary bike on the sideline, but returned for the next series.\n\n\"I'd seen the opening, I ran. I was just trying to get the first down,\" Tagovailoa said. \"Once I passed the 30, though, I felt my leg (hurting) and I was going off momentum after that.\"\n\nAlabama led 16-0 by halftime and forced punts on the Tigers' first nine possessions. LSU (7-2, 4-2, No. 3 CFP) drove to the Alabama 15 on its 10th series early in the fourth quarter, only to miss a field goal with 10:45 to go.\n\n\"Alabama overpowered us,\" LSU coach Ed Orgeron said. \"When you max-protect and you're doing everything you can with protection and they're beating you, you've got to look at personnel. You've got to get better. I don't think it was scheme at all. ... There was nothing we could do about it.\"\n\nTigers quarterback Joe Burrow completed 18 of 35 passes for 184 yards. He was sacked five times and had a late pass intercepted in the end zone by linebacker Mack Wilson. Nose guard Quinnen Williams finished with 2 1/2 sacks. Lineabckers Anfernee Jennings and Christian Miller each had one. Alabama held the Tigers to just 12 yards rushing.\n\n\"It was crazy for us to actually shut them out,\" Alabama linebacker Dylan Moses. \"I wasn't expecting it, but that was a goal for us to get that done.\"\n\nAlabama finished with a 576-196 advantage in total yards in beating LSU for the eighth straight time.\n\n\"We weren't even close to them tonight,\" Orgeron said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAlabama: The best defense Alabama has faced this season wasn't good enough on its own field to stop the Tide from gashing it for eight plays of 20-plus yards, or from covering a two-touchdown spread by two TDs.\n\n\"It shows what kind of things we can do against basically anyone,\" Tagovailoa said.\n\nLSU: The Tigers have had to shuffle their offensive line much of the season, and struggled to match the Tide physically at the point of attack. Guard Garett Brumfield tried to come back for the first time in four games, but struggled and was intermittently replaced by Chasen Hines to start the second half.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWhile nothing changes for Alabama, LSU could tumble considerably in the AP Poll after being dominated at home.\n\nSTATISTICAL STANDOUTS\n\nDamien Harris rushed for 107 yards on 19 carries, including his 1-yard TD run, for Alabama. Najee Harris gained 83 yards on the ground, 29 on one carry.\n\nJerry Jeudy caught eight passes for 103 yards and Irv Smith Jr. had four catches for 64 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown grab late in the first half.\n\n\"I was really, really pleased with the explosive plays we were able to make,\" Saban said.\n\nINJURIES\n\nHenry Ruggs III caught four passes for 55 yards and scored the first touchdown of the game, but injured his left leg late in the second quarter. Saban said X-rays were negative but further evaluation was pending.\n\nTUA'S TURNOVER\n\nTagovailoa's interception came on a deep throw down the middle, which Todd Harris Jr. hauled in for his first career pick while falling to the ground at the LSU 4.\n\n\"That was a good play by the DB,\" Tagovailoa said. \"I should have never made that decision.\"\n\nThe Tiger Stadium crowd erupted, as it appeared the turnover might get LSU to halftime down by no more than nine points, perhaps less, if the Tigers could move the ball.\n\nBut the Crimson Tide's response was emphatic. Burrow was sacked inside the 1, and LSU had to punt shortly afterward.\n\nAlabama got the ball back on its 46 and Tagovailoa needed just two plays \u2014 a 29-yard pass to Jeudy, followed by his scoring strike to Smith \u2014 to widen the Tide's lead.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAlabama hosts Mississippi State on Saturday.\n\nLSU travels to Arkansas on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 After both cleared concussion protocol this week, Justin Herbert and Dillon Mitchell found a groove for the Oregon Ducks.\n\nHerbert threw for 264 yards and two touchdowns and Oregon defeated UCLA 42-21 on Saturday in Bruins coach Chip Kelly's first game at Autzen Stadium since he left the Ducks following the 2012 season.\n\nMitchell caught eight passes for 156 yards and two touchdowns for the Ducks (6-3, 3-2 Pac-12), who became bowl eligible. The victory also snapped a two-game losing streak that had dropped the Ducks out of the rankings.\n\n\"He's a guy that pushes me and I try to push him as much as I can,\" Herbert said about his chemistry with Mitchell. \"He's made me a ton better it's great to have a guy like that in the locker room.\"\n\nWith the loss, UCLA (2-7, 2-4) was guaranteed to finish below .500 in Kelly's first season with the Bruins.\n\nDuring Kelly's four-year tenure Oregon made four straight BCS bowl appearances and he was lauded as the architect of the Ducks' up-tempo \"blur offense.\" He was greeted with a warm ovation when he was introduced prior to the coin flip.\n\nBut he didn't get nostalgic.\n\n\"This wasn't about me. This was about a young team that's learning from their mistakes. A lot of teachable moments from this game,\" he said afterward. \"I don't think that way. I'm a forward thinking guy. To me it's about the journey, it's not about thinking about memories or thinking about moments, it's about what's next.\"\n\nOregon is on its third coach since Kelly's departure. The Ducks let go of Mark Helfrich following the 2016 season, then Willie Taggart stayed for less than a year en route to Florida State, and now Mario Cristobal leads the Ducks.\n\nHerbert started for Oregon after going through concussion protocol earlier this week. He had been under observation after a hard hit in the second half of the Arizona loss. Mitchell also cleared concussion protocol this past week.\n\n\"I would say it's something special,\" Mitchell said of his connection with Herbert. \"It's something we work on.\"\n\nUCLA started Dorian Thompson-Robinson at quarterback against the Ducks. He did not play last weekend in UCLA's loss to Utah because of a shoulder injury and Wilton Speight made his first start since the season opener.\n\nThompson-Robinson threw for 135 yards and a touchdown before Speight replaced him in the third quarter.\n\nOregon's Ugo Amadi scored on a 56-yard punt return to give Oregon an early lead.\n\nThompson-Robinson was intercepted in the end zone by Jevon Holland, and on the ensuing drive Herbert hit Mitchell with a 49-yard pass before CJ Verdell's 1-yard touchdown run \u2014 after the Ducks faked a field goal \u2014 put the Ducks up 14-0.\n\nHerbert also found Mitchell for a 4-yard touchdown in the second quarter. But Thompson-Robinson threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to Caleb Wilson to get UCLA on the scoreboard.\n\nJJ Molson missed a 56-yard field goal for the Bruins as time ran out in the half.\n\nThe Bruins stopped Oregon on a fourth-and-1 attempt and took over on the UCLA 47 but Thompson-Robinson was sacked and fumbled and Oregon's Justin Hollins recovered. A pass interference call got the Ducks to the 1 and Cyrus Habibi-Likio scored on a 1-yard run to put the Ducks up 28-7.\n\nSpeight took over at quarterback for the Bruins, leading the team on a 75-yard drive that ended with Joshua Kelley's 25-yard touchdown run. Kelley finished with 26 carries for 161 yards.\n\nOregon was hurt late in the third when starting center Jake Hanson was ejected for targeting on Speight.\n\nHerbert hit Mitchell with a 67-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter that gave the Ducks a 35-14 lead, but the Bruins answered with Speight's 11-yard touchdown pass to Theo Howard.\n\nSpeight finished with 147 yards passing and a touchdown.\n\nTony Brooks-James ran for a 54-yard touchdown midway through the final quarter for the Ducks for the final margin.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUCLA: Kelly went 46-7 as head coach of the Ducks, including a 26-2 mark at Autzen Stadium. ... It was unclear if Thompson-Robinson was injured by the sack, but he was on the sidelines with his helmet on during the fourth quarter.\n\nOregon: Herbert surpassed 6,000 yards career passing during game. ... The Ducks also won the last five meetings with the Bruins in Eugene, but UCLA hadn't played at Autzen since 2013, when Marcus Mariota was Oregon's quarterback. The last two meetings have been at the Rose Bowl, including last season's 31-14 UCLA victory.\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS\n\nOregon's group met with coaches last Sunday after the loss to Arizona and vowed to get better. It showed on Amadi's punt return and the fake field goal. Amadi said the group was committed: \"Definitely. Especially throughout practice and meeting, we just emphasized taking ownership of it.

(AP Photo/Bill Boyce) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 After getting his 400th career goal, Eric Staal wants to keep on going.\n\nStaal got his milestone goal less than five minutes in to lead the Minnesota Wild to a 5-1 victory over the St. Louis Blues on Saturday night.\n\nThe veteran forward, who began his career in 2003 and skated in his 1,100th game on Oct. 19th, became just the 96th player in NHL history to reach 400 goals. He joined Alex Ovechkin, Patrick Marleau, Ilya Kovalchuk, Sidney Crosby, and Marian Gaborik as the only active players with the mark.2\n\n\"It feels good,\" Staal said. \"I hope there's a lot more yet. I feel like I'm still a young guy. I got a lot more time to play this game. It's a special game and I'm grateful every day I'm in, so I try to prove myself every day. It's cool. I'm sure my kids will have something to say about it tomorrow, which is fun for me and hopefully, more ahead.\"\n\nNick Seeler, J.T. Brown, Matt Dumba and Eric Fehr also scored for the Wild. Devan Dubnyk stopped 15 shots.\n\nRyan O'Reilly scored for St. Louis, and Jake Allen finished with 40 saves.\n\nStaal opened the scoring at 4:42 of the first period with his fifth of the season.\n\n\"It was a heck of tip,\" said Seeler, who assisted on Staal's goal. \"Not a lot of guys can make that play. It was a really nice tip. I just tried to get it kind of by him and let him do the rest.\"\n\nJust 5 seconds later, Seeler got the first of his career as he beat Allen with a slap shot from the left circle to make it 2-0. He also had two assists on the night for the first three point game of his career.\n\n\"It's nice to have that first one go in,\" Seeler said. \"It was exciting and I've just tried to get more pucks to the net and create more offense. We've played so well as a team tonight. It was a great team win. It was fun.\"\n\nThe Blues cut the lead in half as O'Reilly flipped the puck stick side past Dubnyk on the power play at 11:32. O'Reilly has now scored at least one point in seven consecutive games. The Blues lead the NHL with 15 power play goals.\n\nThe Wild restored their two-goal lead with 1:51 left in the first when Brown broke away on a turnover from Jay Bouwmeester and blasted it over Allen's left shoulder for Minnesota's first unassisted goal and his first of the season.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer that balance wins,\" Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. \"When it's difficult to check all four lines and six D, it makes it really hard to play against or match up against a team.\"\n\nThe lone score of the second period came with 4 1/2 minutes left when Brayden Schenn lost the puck in the neutral zone and Mikael Granlund passed it ahead to defenseman Dumba for his fourth. St. Louis challenged the play for offsides, but video replay upheld the initial call. Granlund now has a point in 10 straight games.\n\nSchenn was not on the bench and did not play in the third period. Yeo said Schenn was \"sore.\"\n\nFehr scored his second of the season at 9:15 of the third to cap the scoring.\n\n\"I just thought the balance was really good but they gave us energy when we needed it,\" Boudreau said. \"The Eric Fehr goal at the end of the period, because they were starting to come on a little bit and that sort of finished that. Those are the kind of shifts that you really need and they came up big.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you lose and sometimes you get beat and we got beat all over the ice tonight,\" Blues head coach Mike Yeo said. \"The only thing that's a little bit disturbing is that for a division game and playing at home, we didn't really seem to really get any response tonight. That was disappointing.\"\n\nNOTES: The Blues recorded only five shots on goal in the first period and four in the second as they were outshot 45-16 on the night. ... Minnesota is in the midst of a franchise record seven-game road stretch. This game was the third of seven in a 14-day span that began Oct. 29. ...

Huge win,\" Rinne said. \"Just very happy. So proud that I can stay with this organization that gave me a chance a long time ago, and you know still have that opportunity to chase my dream. So very fortunate.\"\n\nRoman Josi scored for Nashville, which won its third straight to stay atop the league standings. Nashville's captain called Rinne's deal amazing.\n\n\"He's such a big part of this locker room, and he's our leader,\" Josi said. \"I mean he's been here for so long he's such a great guy and obviously best goaltender in the league. To keep a guy like him around, it's awesome for us.\"\n\nRinne improved to 3-1-1 on his birthday in his career.\n\n\"He has been and continues to be the backbone of this organization and this team, probably the guy who's had the biggest impact on this organization,\" coach Peter Laviolette said. \"He's really happy. We're really happy. It's a good day for us.\"\n\nBoston lost for the second time in three games after managing only six shots in the third period. Rinne stopped Brad Marchand's wrister with 44 seconds left. Boston coach Bruce Cassidy took his timeout with 12 seconds left, but the Bruins didn't get another shot off until the final horn sounded.\n\nJaroslav Halak made 39 saves in his fifth start in seven games for Boston. The Bruins went 0 for 4 with the man advantage.\n\n\"Clearly, you can see if our power play and our top line don't score, we have a tough time,\" Cassidy said. \"Our goaltender kept us in the game.\"\n\nNashville was even worse, shut out on five power plays. That included a double-minor on Marchand at the end of the first period for high-sticking and unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\n\"Well, I mean he bit on an embellishment, and that's a tough penalty to call with a second left in the period in a game like that,\" Marchand said. \"So yeah it was frustrating.\"\n\nJosi posted his 300th career point. He got the puck near the blue line and then skated up the right side before cutting back across the ice, beating Halak with a wrister at 14:49 of the first period.\n\nNOTES: A native of Kempele, Finland, Rinne is 28th in NHL history with 316 wins and just four shy of passing Miikka Kiprusoff for most by a Finnish-born goalie. His 53 shutouts rank 23rd in NHL history, one behind Bernie Parent and Ed Giacomin for 21st. Rinne is one of seven goalies with three 40-win seasons and one of 18 with at least 300 wins and 50 shutouts. ... Nashville improved to 9-1-0 when leading after two periods this season. ... Josi already had a season-high seven shots on goal through two periods and finished by tying the franchise record for shots by a defenseman with 10. ... Bruins defenseman Torey Krug played his 400th NHL game. ... Boston RW David Backs played his first game since being hurt Oct. 18.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBruins: Host Dallas on Monday night to start a four-game homestand.\n\nPredators: Start a five-game road swing at Colorado on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(AP Photo/Jim Lytle) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Mississippi State quarterback Nick Fitzgerald's third touchdown pass of the first quarter was a perfect throw, expertly dropped over three Louisiana Tech defenders and into the hands of a sprinting Kylin Hill.\n\nIt was just three weeks ago that the Bulldogs' offense was in complete disarray.\n\nThat's certainly not the case anymore.\n\nFitzgerald threw for 243 yards and four touchdowns to lead No. 21 Mississippi State over Louisiana Tech 45-3 on Saturday night. The Bulldogs are playing some of their best football of the season heading into next week's game against No. 1 Alabama, which is coming off a 29-0 win over LSU.\n\n\"It's very apparent I'm a lot more comfortable in the pocket, a lot more comfortable in the passing game,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I really liked our last two games and the plan that we've had.\"\n\nMississippi State (6-3, No. 18 CFP) was never seriously challenged on Saturday, scoring 21 points in the first quarter of what quickly turned into a lopsided game. Fitzgerald completed 17 of 28 passes and threw his touchdowns to Stephen Guidry, Deddrick Thomas, Jesse Jackson and Hill.\n\n\"We needed to start fast and knock the belief out of these guys,\" Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said.\n\nFitzgerald also ran for 107 yards. Mississippi State has a 16-3 record during Fitzgerald's career when he breaks the 100-yard mark.\n\nLouisiana Tech (6-3) was competitive in a loss to LSU this season, but its second game against a Southeastern Conference opponent didn't go well. J'Mar Smith completed 14 of 30 passes for 98 yards.\n\nMississippi State's offensive revival continued for a second straight game after an encouraging 28-13 win over Texas A&M last week. The Bulldogs finished with 532 total yards against Louisiana Tech.\n\nFitzgerald had plenty of time to throw most of the night and his four touchdown passes in the first half went for 11, 36, 23 and 10 yards. That helped give the Bulldogs a comfortable 31-3 halftime lead.\n\n\"I did not expect them to do to our defense what they did,\" Louisiana Tech coach Skip Holtz said. \"That is a real testament to them, and the way they came out and played.\"\n\nTo put Fitzgerald's improvement in perspective, he threw just four touchdown passes over his first six starts of the season. On Saturday, he had four in less than 30 minutes of game action.\n\nMississippi State's defense was once again excellent, giving up just 238 total yards. The Bulldogs didn't give up a touchdown on Saturday and they've given up just nine offensive touchdowns all season, which leads the nation.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLouisiana Tech was never a factor in this one. The offense occasionally moved the ball, but couldn't score touchdowns. The defense gave up too many big plays in the first half, especially in the passing game.\n\nMississippi State's offense has done a complete 180 over the past two weeks and Fitzgerald's arm has turned into an asset instead of a liability. Now the Bulldogs get their shot at top-ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa next weekend and there's no doubt Mississippi State will have to play a near-perfect game to have a chance.\n\n\"Certainly, when you're heading on the road to play the No. 1 team in the country, you definitely want to have momentum going in your favor,\" Moorhead said.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nMississippi State won't get a huge bump from beating a team from Conference USA, but the convincing nature of the victory should give the Bulldogs a small boost.\n\nSTAT OF THE GAME\n\nMississippi State's defense has allowed just two touchdowns over opponents' last 51 offensive possessions.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLouisiana Tech hosts Rice next Saturday.\n\nMississippi State travels to face Alabama next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jim Young) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEVANSTON, Ill. (AP) \u2014 No. 3 Notre Dame looked as if it was running away with another victory, leading by 17 points early in the fourth quarter.\n\nIt turned out the Fighting Irish needed one more big dash to secure it.\n\nIan Book threw two touchdown passes and ran 23 yards for a score in the closing minutes to lead Notre Dame to a 31-21 victory over Northwestern on Saturday night.\n\nThe Fighting Irish (9-0, No. 4 CFP) remained in line for a playoff spot and continued to build on their best start since the 2012 team went undefeated before losing to Alabama in the BCS championship game. The Wildcats (5-4) had won four in a row to grab the Big Ten West lead and they stayed in this one when it looked like Notre Dame was ready to pull away.\n\nBook threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to a leaping Miles Boykin in the corner of the end zone and a 47-yarder to Michael Young in the third to put the Irish ahead a 21-7. He sealed it in the closing minutes with that 23-yard run untouched up the left side, after a 17-point lead early in the fourth shrank to three.\n\n\"It's a pretty awesome feeling,\" Book said. \"It's hard to win in November. We're in such a good situation, and we know that, but I think this team does such a good job of focusing one week at a time. Everyone's excited, but everyone's just ready for Florida State (next week).\"\n\nThe Irish were in a similar spot last season, only to stumble down the stretch. They were No. 3 in the first two playoff rankings en route to an 8-1 start, only to go 2-2 the rest of the way \u2014 beginning with a blowout loss to Miami.\n\n\"We didn't do a good job of just staying focused,\" linebacker Te'Von Coney said. \"We looked too far ahead and it cost us. This year, we have to stay in the moment; that's the key.\"\n\nIt was 24-7 early in the fourth when Northwestern's Clayton Thorson threw a 27-yard touchdown to Riley Lees. Cameron Ruiz then blocked a punt by Tyler Newsome, giving the Wildcats possession on the Notre Dame 17. That led to a 1-yard sneak by Thorson, cutting it to 24-21 with 7:05 left.\n\n\"I could say we relaxed a little bit, but I think it was just Northwestern throwing their last punch,\" defensive end Julian Okwara said.\n\nEither way, Notre Dame didn't get rattled.\n\n\"They've been like that all year,\" coach Brian Kelly said. \"They just play one play at a time. They don't get too high, they don't get too low. They knew in the second half they needed to play much better football, especially offensively.\"\n\nBook improved to 6-0 as the starter, going 22 of 34 for 343 yards. Chase Claypool had eight receptions for 130 yards, and Dexter Williams ran for a 1-yard touchdown in the first quarter.\n\nThe Wildcats haven't beaten a top-five opponent since 1959, when Ara Parseghian was their coach. Though they are 0-3 in nonconference games, they still lead their division.\n\nThorson was 16 of 29 for 141 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for two TDs. Isaiah Bowser added 93 yards rushing on 23 attempts after back-to-back 100-yard games.\n\n\"Best atmosphere I've ever played in at Ryan Field,\" right guard Tommy Doles said. \"We were really excited about this game so it's very disappointing. But all our goals are ahead of us. We set out to win the West and that's what we plan to do.\"\n\nEARLY CHANCES\n\nBoth teams missed some big scoring opportunities in the first half. The Irish were also hurt by penalties.\n\nNorthwestern blew a big chance after linebacker Blake Gallagher recovered a fumble by Book on the game's opening possession. The Wildcats took over at the Notre Dame 35, only to come away empty-handed when Charlie Kuhbander missed a 39-yard field goal wide right.\n\nThe Irish then went 79 yards, with Williams plowing in from the 1 to give them a 7-0 lead and delight the fans in blue and gold. But they also missed a big chance late in the quarter. Two penalties helped drive them back from the Northwestern 5 to the 27 before Justin Yoon's 44-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.\n\nNorthwestern tied it midway through the second quarter when Thorson scored from the 1. Bennett Skowronek kept the drive going with a one-handed grab on fourth-and-5 at the Notre Dame 21, and the Irish's Jalen Elliott got flagged for interference breaking up a pass intended for Cameron Green in the end zone.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNotre Dame: The Irish remained in the playoff hunt even though this wasn't an easy game.\n\nNorthwestern: The Wildcats hung with one of the nation's best teams, only to come up short. The loss doesn't impact the division standings.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNotre Dame: Hosts Florida State on Nov. 10.\n\nNorthwestern: Visits Iowa on Nov. 10.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) \u2014 This time, Duke didn't lose on a Miami miracle.\n\nQuentin Harris' jump pass to Daniel Helm late in the third quarter put Duke ahead for good, and the Blue Devils got a stop on the final play to beat reeling Miami 20-12 on a rain-soaked Saturday night and hand the Hurricanes their third straight loss.\n\nDuke outscored the Hurricanes 13-0 after halftime, and won at Miami for the first time since 1976.\n\n\"Best feeling in the world,\" Duke linebacker Ben Humphreys said. \"We stuck together like glue. Adversity struck. We got down but we battled back.\"\n\nDeon Jackson scored on a 75-yard rush on the game's first snap from scrimmage for Duke (6-3, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), which secured bowl eligibility. The Blue Devils \u2014 who lost when Miami scored on an eight-lateral kickoff return as time expired at Duke in 2015 \u2014 saw this game come down to the very last play, but Miami quarterback N'Kosi Perry's pass from the Duke 28 fell incomplete.\n\n\"The performance I had tonight, it's definitely not acceptable,\" said Perry, who completed 5 of 16 passes for 35 yards.\n\nDeejay Dallas had an 83-yard touchdown run for Miami (5-4, 2-3) and finished with 124 rushing yards, but also fumbled the ball away twice. Travis Homer had a game-high 133 rushing yards and a touchdown for the Hurricanes.\n\n\"They fought hard. We fought hard,\" Duke coach David Cutcliffe said. \"That was an old-fashioned mud game. We were fortunate to pull it out and get the win in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nIt was a bad day for Miami, and a worse day for the Sunshine State.\n\nIt was just the third time in the last 40 years that Miami, Florida and Florida State, the \"Big Three\" of college football in the Sunshine State lost on the same day. The others were Oct. 30, 2004 and Oct. 8, 2011 \u2014 though all three schools also lost last weekend, just not on the same day.\n\nMiami started Malik Rosier at quarterback, and he completed 8 of 12 passes for 76 yards. Perry replaced Rosier early and they rotated throughout the game.\n\n\"It would be in our best interest if one guy steps up,\" Miami coach Mark Richt said. \"We're still trying to find that answer right now.\"\n\nMiami has not scored more than 14 points in any of its last three games. Miami got to the Duke 13 in the final seconds and Lawrence Cager caught what would have been a touchdown pass with 10 ticks remaining, but he was called for offensive pass interference and two plays later the game was over.\n\nWith the field waterlogged, thanks to a first-half downpour, both offenses struggled. But Duke found a way to create its own breaks on the drive that gave it the lead.\n\nFacing third-and-3 at the Miami 15, Jackson took a handoff, stopped short of the line of scrimmage and threw a jump pass to the 6-foot-4 Helm \u2014 who couldn't make the initial catch, but tipped the ball over 5-foot-11 Miami safety Jaquan Johnson, then dove and caught his own deflection as Johnson punched the turf in disbelief.\n\n\"Just the game of football,\" Johnson said. \"Sometimes it goes like that.\"\n\nThe go-ahead pass from Harris came two plays later.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nDuke: Jackson finished with 113 rushing yards for Duke, and quarterback Daniel Jones completed 17 of 35 passes for 130 yards. Linebacker Joe Giles-Harris was huge for Duke, with 12 tackles and a blocked field goal in the third quarter.\n\nMiami: Dallas' touchdown run was the sixth-longest rush in Miami history, a run where he splashed with every step down the field. The Hurricanes rushed for 300 yards \u2014 the last time they ran for so many in a loss was in 2007, when quarterback Kirby Freeman went 1 for 14 against North Carolina State.\n\nPITCH IMPERFECT\n\nThe downpour that started shortly after kickoff left the turf at Hard Rock Stadium a complete mess. Countless puddles lined the field for most of the first half, and a considerable amount of grass was worn down to a layer of slick brown mud. That's not good news for the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, who play on the same field Sunday at 1 p.m.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDuke: Host North Carolina on Nov. 10.\n\nMiami: Visit Georgia Tech on Nov. 10.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump hammered his closing message on immigration during a pair of campaign rallies Saturday, repeatedly evoking an image of barbed wire being pulled along the border as he urged voters to consider \u201csecurity\u201d when they turn out for next week\u2019s pivotal midterm elections.\n\nMaking what is expected to be his final visit to Florida before voters decide control of Congress on Tuesday, Trump blasted Democratic opposition to his proposed border wall and criticized an idea raised by some liberal Democrats \u2013 and opposed by the party\u2019s leaders \u2013 to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIn doubling down on his immigration stance and describing the caravan of Central Americans still more than 700 miles from the border as an imminent threat, Trump has revived a theme that worked well for him in the 2016 election and tapped into a frustration felt by millions of Americans over illegal immigration.\n\nMore: Donald Trump says there's 'no reason' to go on about the economy\n\nMore: Migrant caravan, with no promised buses, trudges onward through Veracruz\n\nBut it remains unclear whether the success Trump had in using immigration in 2016 will transfer to the midterm elections. Polls in key states indicate immigration remains a salient issue for many voters, especially Republicans, along with the economy and healthcare.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats get elected they will do everything in their power to dismantle ICE; they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for violent predators and ruthless gang members,\u201d Trump told the audience in Pensacola, Florida on Saturday. \u201cWe will keep the criminals, drug dealers, terrorists the hell out of our country.\u201d\n\nDuring both the Florida rally and an event earlier in Montana, Trump noted he had ordered more troops to the border in response to the caravan and pointed to images of U.S. soldiers running what he called \u201cbeautiful\u201d barbed wire along the Texas side of the Rio Grande\n\nHe also has been increasingly tailoring his immigration message to women voters who are expected to play an important role in turnout.\n\nThe president has been notably silent about another element of his immigration plan: An effort he announced at the White House on Thursday to curb asylum. Arguing that the asylum system is being abused, Trump threatened to erect \u201ctent cities\u201d to hold migrants at the border until their asylum application could be fully reviewed by a court.\n\nMore: Trump calls for new limits on seeking asylum claims as he pushes immigration issue ahead of midterms\n\nOn Saturday, Trump mentioned neither the tents nor an executive order he said he would sign next week to limit asylum. He also has only barely returned to the issue of birthright citizenship, which he suggested earlier this week he could roll back by executive order.\n\nDemocrats, including former President Barack Obama, have been pushing back on Trump\u2019s position as they make their own closing case to voters.\n\n\u201cA president doesn't get to decide on his own who's an American citizen and who's not,\u201d Obama said in Florida on Friday. \u201cThat's not how the Constitution of the United States works. That's not how the Bill of Rights works.\u201d\n\nTrump threatened earlier this month to close the border with Mexico, a major trading partner, and also claimed on Twitter that the caravan included unknown \u201cMiddle Easterners.\u201d Neither Trump nor the White House have provided evidence to back up the latter claim.\n\nMore: Tracking Trump\u2019s many threats, claims on immigration, caravan ahead of midterm elections\n\nThe president is almost certain to continue to press immigration as he campaigns on Sunday and Monday. His schedule includes with stops in Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. The president\u2019s campaign also announced that it would hold a telephone town hall with supporters on the eve of the election.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/03/midterm-elections-2018-donald-trump-hammers-immigration-message/1881561002/", "Atlanta Hawks center Alex Len (25) comes down with a rebound against Miami Heat forward Derrick Jones Jr. (5) during the second half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Atlanta.

Back with the Oilers this season after nine years away, he got two Saturday night.\n\nBrodziak scored his first two goals of the season and star center Connor McDavid ran his point streak to seven games in the Oilers' 4-3 win over the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nBrodziak, 34, played for the Minnesota Wild and St. Louis Blues before returning to Edmonton this season as a free agent. The center's last goal for the Oilers had come on March 27, 2009.\n\n\"No. I honestly don't really remember it.

(Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP)\n\nShowdown Saturday disposed of the SEC pretenders and set up a rematch that seemed inevitable since last January.\n\nAlabama vs. Georgia in Atlanta, this time for the Southeastern Conference championship instead of the national title. It is the earliest the SEC championship game has ever been set.\n\nThe much-hyped SEC doubleheader that decided both divisions turned out to be a dud: The top-ranked Tide toyed with No. 4 LSU . The sixth-ranked Bulldogs left No. 11 Kentucky in the dust.\n\nThe Tigers and Wildcats can still go on to good seasons, maybe New Year's Six bowls, but they were out of their league Saturday. Alabama and Georgia have work to do over the next three weeks to set up one of the most highly anticipated SEC title games ever.\n\nIt's hard to fathom the Tide not arriving at Mercedes-Benz Stadium with a 12-0 record. The Tide offense was sometimes slowed but the supposedly vulnerable defense feasted on LSU's limited offense. Tua Tagovailoa is the Heisman Trophy front-runner, but there is a case to be made that Alabama's best player is defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, who was unblockable against LSU.\n\nGeorgia is not as safe a bet as Alabama to get through without another loss. And are the Bulldogs really a threat to take down the Tide? Comparing scores can dicey, but the Bulldogs lost at LSU a month ago.\n\nBoth Alabama and Georgia can probably afford a loss before they get to Atlanta and still make the College Football Playoff. No doubt Alabama would get in as a 12-1 SEC champion. Georgia, with a victory against 'Bama, could make a good case as an 11-2 SEC champ. The real question is: If Alabama enters the SEC championship game undefeated, does the result even matter for the Tide?\n\nA lot would depend on what else happens around the country.\n\nLet's hope the selection committee is not so quick to give Alabama a mulligan if it doesn't win the conference championship. There is little doubt Nick Saban's team is the best in the country \u2014 maybe the best he has ever had \u2014 but it's not as if the Tide has had to run a gantlet of a schedule this season.\n\nThere will be much complaining in advance about even the possibility that Alabama could make the playoff for a second straight season without winning its conference \u2014 which would also likely put two SEC teams in the CFP for the second straight year.\n\nAlabama is probably going to make all of that talk moot by stomping everything in its path.\n\nA'MAIZE 'N BLUE\n\nNo. 2 Clemson may be the closest thing to Alabama right now. No. 5 Michigan is making a case that it is not that far behind the top two.\n\nThe Wolverines have one last big hurdle remaining before what would be their first College Football Playoff appearance, and it is an Ohio State team that still looks lost.\n\nThe Game is three weeks away. Michigan plays at Rutgers next week and has Indiana at home the week after. Then the Wolverines go to the Horseshoe. For the first time since Jim Harbaugh became the head coach in Ann Arbor, Michigan will clearly have the better team when it faces the Buckeyes.\n\nMichigan humiliated Penn State in the Big House. Its defense might be the best in the country and its offense has found an identity behind quarterback Shea Patterson and running back Karan Higdon.\n\nThe Buckeyes have dominated the rivalry with Michigan for more than a decade, winning 13 out of 14 and all three since Harbaugh took over. But Ohio State in its current state will be hard-pressed to keep Michigan out of the Big Ten championship for the first time. The Big Ten West is likely to throw out Northwestern as its representative in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Wildcats were the last team to come close to beating the Wolverines, jumping out to a 17-0 first-half lead on Sept. 29. Since then, Michigan has outscored the opposition 163-48. It's not quite the run Clemson has been on since that same day, when it rallied from 23-13 in the fourth quarter against Syracuse. Clemson has outscored its opposition 254-36 since that point. Michigan's run has come against better competition, though.\n\nFOR THE WIN\n\nDana Holgorsen and No. 12 West Virginia were going for the win all the way on their final drive against No. 15 Texas , and Will Grier converted the winning 2-point conversion to keep the Mountaineers in first place in the Big 12.\n\nHolgorsen rarely gets mentioned as being among the best coaches in college football, and that's probably fair. He has won only one conference title and that was when West Virginia was still in the Big East. But in some ways Holgo has become a little undervalued during his seven seasons at West Virginia, known as much for his mad-scientist hair and love of Red Bull than being a sharp offensive mind who fields winning teams without highly ranked recruits.\n\nThe transition for West Virginia to the Big 12 was no small task. Holgorsen guided the Mountaineers through it with only one losing season. Holgorsen's overall record is 60-38, and in the Big 12 he is 37-30.\n\nThere are always rumblings that Holgorsen might be on the lookout for another job and that he and athletic director Shane Lyons don't exactly see eye-to-eye. Now Holgorsen's team is a legitimate playoff contender heading down the stretch, with a home game against No. 7 Oklahoma to finish the season. At this point, Holgorsen is the conference's coach of the year.\n\nAROUND THE COUNTRY\n\nJust when you thought the ACC Coastal was the most muddled and mediocre Power Five division \u2014 first-place Pitt!\u2014 the Pac-12 South stepped up on Saturday, with Arizona State knocking off No. 16 Utah . Arizona, which was 3-5 and looking like a massive disappointment just a few weeks ago, is now tied for first in the division with Utah and USC at 4-3 ... Next week's big game? Try Clemson going to No. 24 Boston College . Clemson can clinch the ACC Atlantic with a victory, but BC would have the inside track to the division title if it can pull off the upset. It will be the first time this season ESPN's \"College GameDay\" goes to the site of an ACC game ... After losing at home to Duke for the first time since 1976, Miami holds the title of most disappointing team in the country. The Hurricanes were No. 8 preseason and if not for a frantic rally against a terrible Florida State team, their last victory would be in September against North Carolina. ... Navy looks like it is headed toward its worst season since going 2-10 in 2002. The Midshipmen were shut out for the first time since 2012, losing to Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

It was his first multi-goal game of the season.\n\n\"I'm trying to get back that shooting mentality,\" Stamkos said. \"Obviously, when you get one early in the game, you're feeling more confident.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Remembering recent failures when it comes to extending winning streaks and fearing the defending Stanley Cup champions turned out to be a perfect recipe for the Dallas Stars.\n\nDallas started fast with two goals 10 seconds apart and finished strong in a 4-3 overtime victory over the Washington Capitals on Saturday night, giving the Stars their first three-game winning streak of the season. Jason Dickinson scored 3:17 into overtime to keep Dallas rolling under first-year coach Jim Montgomery.\n\n\"There's a lot of belief right now,\" Montgomery said. \"I don't see any complacency in our group. I just see a determination and a focus that I haven't seen before. That's the exciting part.\"\n\nThe excitement is building for the Stars, who are starting to develop some consistency. Jason Spezza scored on a breakaway and Tyler Pitlick forced a turnover for an unassisted goal 10 seconds later as Dallas jumped out to a 2-0 lead that showed players they could hang with the Capitals.\n\n\"When you come in here, there's a little bit of fear of knowing that they can run you out of the rink if you're not ready to go off the hop,\" Spezza said. \"You can't take these guys lightly, and I thought we learned a lesson from some of the other games we played on the road.\"\n\nIn the process, the Stars also learned about rebounding from mistakes and moving forward after blowing a lead. Goaltender Ben Bishop allowed soft goals from sharp angles to Nicklas Backstrom and Evgeny Kuznetsov, Dallas' defensive structure was lacking and yet it was able to get to overtime.\n\nPlaying 3-on-3 in OT, Dallas outshot Washington 6-1. Capitals goalie Braden Holtby stopped Tyler Seguin on a penalty shot 59 seconds in, but Dickinson beat him on a deflection for his third of the season.\n\n\"We'll take it,\" said Bishop, who stopped 29 shots. \"They're not always going to be Picassos. Sometimes you're going to have to grind. Last game we had to hold on at the end. This one we had to find a way to come back and get that one in overtime. Finding different ways to win, that's the big thing. It doesn't matter how, just as long as you get it.\"\n\nIt also was a struggle for the Capitals, who turned the puck over on all three Stars goals in regulation and still had a chance after Kuznetsov tied it on the power play with 12:03 remaining in the third period. Brett Connolly also scored for Washington, but ill-timed turnovers in the wrong places led to a second consecutive defeat.\n\n\"Every team comes fast like that,\" said Holtby, who gave the puck away to Pitlick for his goal. \"It's not a surprise. You just have to be prepared for it and have a plan and execute. A couple plays, we didn't do that.\"\n\nWhile the Capitals continue to search for the kind of 60-minute effort that defined their playoff run last spring, the Stars are feeling good in the middle of a long Eastern Conference road trip. Montgomery set the goal of three wins in six games, and his team is already there with two left before returning home.\n\n\"Everyone's contributing,\" Montgomery said. \"You're together and it's a good feeling and everyone is enjoying being around each other.\"\n\nNOTES: Holtby finished with 32 saves plus his stop on Seguin on the penalty shot in overtime. ... Captain Jamie Benn also scored for Dallas, his sixth goal of the season. ... Capitals D Brooks Orpik missed his second consecutive game with a lower-body injury. He did not practice all week. ... Stars D Marc Methot and F Alexander Radulov were out with lower-body injuries. Montgomery said Radulov returned to Dallas for treatment and will miss the final two games of the trip. ...

As the ball dropped through the net, Oladipo skipped toward the bench.\n\n\"We were really calm,\" Oladipo said. \"The crowd was excited, but we were calm. We knew we needed one more stop.\"\n\nAfter the Celtics used a timeout to advance the ball and draw up a final play, Gordon Hayward inbounded but had his pass deflected and stolen by Oladipo, snapping a four-game win streak for Boston, which reached the Eastern Conference finals last spring.\n\nThe Pacers, coming off a first-round playoff exit, passed an early-season test in large part by repeatedly earning free throws. While Boston attempted only nine, and made six, Indiana shot 19 of 25 from the line.\n\nThat came in handy on a night Boston shot 43 percent (38 for 88) and the Pacers 41 percent (36 for 87).\n\n\"We're living on the edge a little too much,\" said Horford, who had 14 points and six rebounds. \"Maybe this will wake us up.\"\n\nTyreke Evans had 17 points for the Pacers, Bojan Bogdanovic scored 16, and Domantas Sabonis added 12 points, nine rebounds and five assists.\n\nIndiana trailed 28-18 after the first quarter, and by as many as 13 in the first half, but forged a tie at 45 at halftime and knotted the score at 72 on Evans' last-second 3 to close the third period.\n\n\"It was huge moving forward, just to get a good spirit and energy for our season,\" Indiana guard Darren Collison said. \"We all came together.

You just never know when the game is going to change.\"\n\nMarcus Morris had a team-high 23 points and six rebounds for the Celtics.\n\n\"We got beat by a good team,\" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. \"Oladipo made a big shot.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nCeltics: Irving finished with 18 points and six boards, and Hayward was the only starter not to score in double figures, finishing with four points and seven rebounds. . Marcus Smart contributed three points and nine assists. .

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 So much for all that talk about the New York Islanders' situation in goal.\n\nThomas Greiss and Robin Lehner have formed a pretty solid tandem so far.\n\nGreiss made 35 saves for his first shutout of the season, and the Islanders beat the New Jersey Devils 3-0 on Saturday night for their fifth straight win.\n\n\"We feed off that,\" forward Josh Bailey said. \"When he and Lehner are on, it adds so much confidence to our team.\"\n\nIt was Greiss' ninth career shutout. Dating to Oct. 28, Greiss has allowed just four goals on 114 shots.\n\n\"It's going well and everyone is happy and enjoying hockey right now,\" he said.\n\nJordan Eberle, Brock Nelson and Scott Mayfield scored for New York (8-4-1), which improved to 6-0-0 against the Metropolitan Division this season. Bailey had two assists to extend his point streak to eight games.\n\n\"When you get on these streaks as a team and individually you want to ride them for as long as you can,\" Bailey said. \"But it's about staying even keel and not thinking too much about it, and preparing the same way you do every game.\"\n\nDespite losing for the sixth time in seven games, the Devils (5-5-1) left Barclays Center feeling positive about their performance.\n\n\"There's plenty of season left,\" said Keith Kinkaid, who had 30 saves. \"We're just going through a little (stretch). Everything is a learning curve.\n\n\"We have to keep sticking at it.\"\n\nThe Devils came up empty on two early power-play chances before the Islanders grabbed the lead on Eberle's power-play goal 7:43 into the game. With Jean-Sebastien Dea in the box for hooking Adam Pelech, Eberle tapped in Anders Lee's rebound for his fourth of the season, and third in New York's last three games.\n\n\"I had quite a few chances again,\" Eberle said. \"So you want to try and maintain (the) things you're having success with.\"\n\nNew Jersey outshot New York 35-33 for the game, but the Islanders were 1 for 4 on the power play and killed all four man advantages for the Devils.\n\n\"We'd almost take that game than playing (poorly) and winning,\" New Jersey star Taylor Hall said. \"Sometimes you have to go through (a stretch) during a season and find your game. Find an example of how you need to play night in and night out. And sometimes results are going to come, and sometimes you're going to play \u2014 like I said (poorly) and win. Right now we'll take the way we played.\"\n\nNeither team was able develop any traction offensively in a stop-and-start second period, with the best chance being Hall's semi-breakaway at 8:06 that Greiss knocked away.\n\n\"We didn't get any bounces,\" New Jersey coach John Hynes said.\n\nThe third was a mirror image of the second, although New York did generate seven shot attempts in a 52-second span after Lee forced a Hall turnover.\n\nNelson got his team-leading seventh goal of the season with 4:54 left. The sequence began with Nick Leddy blocking a Mirco Mueller shot, leading to a 2-on-1 with Nelson and Bailey.\n\nMayfield's empty-netter ended the scoring.\n\n\"I really liked our second and I really liked our third,\" New York coach Barry Trotz said. \"I really like our mindset.\"\n\nNOTES: Following New York's optional skate, Trotz said LW Matt Martin would miss the game with an upper-body injury.

(AP Photo/Bob Leverone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 This was the effort Hornets coach James Borrego was hoping to get from Jeremy Lamb when he named him the team's starting shooting guard before the season.\n\nLamb had a season-high 19 points and eight rebounds, and Charlotte made light work of the Cleveland Cavaliers, winning 126-94 on Saturday night.\n\nBorrego said Lamb was \"fantastic,\" and now wants to see him bring that same aggressive attack-the-basket mentality every night.\n\n\"This is where I see Jeremy helping us,\" Borrego said. \"I think he fits in that starting unit. ... I loved his aggressiveness tonight, getting to the rim. I think he got to the paint more than anybody tonight. If people want to put two guys on Kemba (Walker) that's his time to attack and a lot of his attacks and aggressiveness now are in transition.\"\n\nBorrego said his only concern with Lamb entering the season was if he could guard the opposing team's shooter night after night. He's had some help so far from Nic Batum, but it's clear he has improved in that area.\n\n\"Night after night at the two guard position you have to be ready to guard,\" Lamb said. \"I've been working to try to keep getting better on both ends of the floor. Defensively is a big thing I need to work on, and I'm gonna keep working.\"\n\nTwo-time All-Star Kemba Walker had 18 points and Malik Monk added 16 for the Hornets, who improved to .500 on the season. Charlotte had balanced scoring throughout, with seven players finishing in double digits, including five off the bench.\n\nJ.R. Smith scored 14 points for the struggling Cavaliers (1-8), who are playing without the injured Kevin Love and put up very little resistance on defense.\n\nThe Hornets looked sluggish early on, but broke the game open late in the third behind a 26-11 run that made it a 20-point game.\n\nTony Parker, who has been a big addition for the Hornets as a player and as a leader of the second team, led the way during the key stretch, scoring on a pair of floaters and then delivering a perfect alley-oop pass to Monk, who soared above the rim after losing his man on a backdoor cut.\n\nUnlike Thursday night, when the Hornets surrendered a 19-point third quarter lead to Russell Westbrook and the Thunder, Charlotte had no intention of letting this one slip away. They quickly extended the lead to 29 points when Walker knocked down his fourth 3-pointer with 7:14 remaining in the game. He exited the game shortly after.\n\nTIP INS\n\nCavaliers: Were outrebounded 49-28. ... Kyle Korver had 11 points, with three 3-pointers.\n\nHornets: Owner Michael Jordan took in the game courtside, sitting at the end of the Hornets' bench. ... David Tepper, the owner of the other major sports franchise in the city, the NFL's Carolina Panthers, also attended the game.\n\nBENCH GETTING IT DONE\n\nThe Hornets entered the game second in the NBA in bench scoring and got it done again against the Cavs with five reserves scoring in double digits. Borrego said he feels like the second unit is establishing an identity, adding that \"I love our bench.\"\n\n\"They are playing with haste, playing with urgency,\" Borrego said. \"Tony Parker understands what we're trying to get done offensively and getting Malik Monk in the right spots.\"\n\nDIFFERENT LOOKS\n\nCavaliers acting head coach Larry Drew used several different combinations on the floor throughout the night, but nothing seemed to work.\n\n\"This team is obviously going in a different direction than it's been the last four years,\" Drew said of the post-LeBron James era. \"As a coach, you still have to find what works. And right now I don't know what works for this team.

He threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns, none prettier than his lofting, over-the-shoulder toss into the end zone for the game\u2019s final score.\n\nThe Mountaineers, 7-1, were ranked 13th in the debut playoff rankings, last among one-loss teams from the Power Five conferences. Look for WVU to threaten for this week\u2019s top 10, moving ahead of No. 12 Central Florida, No. 11 Florida and No. 9 Kentucky, if not No. 10 Ohio State.\n\nThis makes West Virginia\u2019s one of the day\u2019s biggest winners. But the loser will eventually be the Big 12 Conference. The league has added a title game and, this season, rejiggered its schedule to have more marquee games in November. It\u2019s a good idea in theory, but it\u2019s led to this scenario: Oklahoma and WVU meeting in the season finale and again one week later to decide the Big 12 title, meaning one of the two must be the other twice in seven days to conceivably reach the playoff.\n\nHere are the rest of Saturday\u2019s winners and losers:\n\nWinners\n\nMichigan\n\nTeamed with Ohio State\u2019s narrow win against Nebraska, Saturday\u2019s 42-7 destruction of Penn State makes the following official: Michigan is the front-runner in the Big Ten Conference. Consider how the Wolverines owned the Nittany Lions: PSU accounted for just 186 yards of total offense while Michigan ran for 259 yards on 5.2 yards per carry. This team is a real contender.\n\nCLEAR FAVORITE: Michigan shows it's class of Big Ten with Penn State rout\n\nGeorgia\n\nEven in what has been perceived as an uneven season, Georgia are repeat winners of the SEC East Division and at the very least will play for a spot in a New Year\u2019s Six bowl. And at best, Saturday\u2019s 34-17 win against upstart Kentucky will propel the Bulldogs through a perfect rest of November and into the SEC title game needing just one more win to return to the playoff. Is this what uneven looks like?\n\nBULLDOGS BITE: No. 5 Georgia runs past No. 12 Kentucky for SEC East title\n\nJeff Brohm\n\nPurdue\u2019s second-year coach did it again, with this week\u2019s 38-36 win against No. 18 Iowa joining last month\u2019s knockout of Ohio State to leave the Boilermakers one win short of bowl eligibility with three games left to play. You\u2019re beginning to see why Brohm\u2019s name is destined to be tied to nearly every major job opening this coming winter, notably at his alma mater, Louisville.\n\nTexas-El Paso\n\nThe Miners\u2019 34-26 win at Rice was the program\u2019s first victory in nearly two years \u2014 ending a 20-game losing streak that begin with the first game of the 2017 season. The longest active losing stretch in the FBS now belongs to Rutgers, which lost its eighth in a row in falling 31-17 to Wisconsin.\n\nLosers\n\nFlorida\n\nEvery win from this point forward is gravy for Dan Mullen, who inherited a four-win team and already has the Gators at six wins and in bowl play. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good look to be down 21-3 and 35-10 before losing 38-17 to a Missouri team previously winless in SEC play.\n\nOhio State\n\nNebraska can point to this 36-31 loss as another measurement of the progress made in Scott Frost\u2019s first season. The Cornhuskers\u2019 growth in the past month has been obvious. Ohio State can point to the win, meanwhile, and not see answers to any of the questions that have plagued the Buckeyes for much of the season. In other words, it\u2019s nice to be back in the win column \u2014 but this team still has questions to answer.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s 38-28 win dropped North Carolina to 1-7, the worst record of any team in the Power Five, and makes the Tar Heels just 4-16 overall since the start of last season. What\u2019s most striking about the rapid slide has been where the program stood heading out of 2016: UNC was 19-8 in the previous two seasons, including a top-15 finish in 2015.\n\nLouisville\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Bobby Petrino\u2019s fifth season is an evolving series of embarrassments, the latest a 77-16 drubbing to Clemson that made Louisville look like an opponent from one of college football\u2019s lower levels of competition. That this season is unfolding as Brohm finds continued success at Purdue has ignited frantic debate regarding Petrino\u2019s future, creating the sort of spicy scenario that could fracture an already fragile fan base.\n\nFlorida State\n\nMaintaining the longest bowl streak in FBS history has gone from improbable to outright unlikely for the Seminoles, now sitting at 4-5 after a 47-28 loss at North Carolina State.

(AP Photo/Wade Payne) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Marquez Callaway knew if he could just get to the edge, there was a good chance he could score.\n\nThe junior wide receiver returned a punt for a touchdown and Tennessee's defense nearly pitched a shutout as the Vols defeated Charlotte 14-3 in their final nonconference game of the season Saturday.\n\nIn the first meeting between the programs, Tennessee (4-5) kept its bowl hopes alive while snapping a two-game losing streak in front of a paltry announced homecoming crowd of 86,753 at Neyland Stadium.\n\nCallaway's first-quarter score was one of the few offensive bright spots for UT, which struggled to run the ball yet again and was held scoreless for the final three quarters.\n\nGetting a bit of a running start, Callaway sprinted a career-high 82 yards for his second career punt return for a touchdown to give the Vols an early 7-0 lead.\n\n\"It was good to get into the end zone,\" said Callaway, who scored for the first time this season. \"The team was probably happy for me more than I was, especially a punt return because they always tell me if I can get to the edge we got our man and we promise you are going to make it.\"\n\nIf Tennessee was hoping for a confidence-boosting offensive performance against a non-Power 5 opponent, the Vols didn't find it against Charlotte (4-5).\n\nThe Vols were limited to just 192 total yards and equaled their season-low in points scored.\n\nCharlotte entered the game ranked sixth in the FBS in rushing defense (88.9 yards), and improved its standing against an SEC opponent. The 49ers held the Vols to only 20 net rushing yards on 26 attempts for a 0.8 average per rush. Until UT's final offensive drive in the fourth quarter, the Vols were in negative rushing yardage.\n\n\"We didn't make any explosive plays and we really struggled to be consistent running the football. That is not a good recipe for success,\" Tennessee head coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \"We did find a way to create a positive play on special teams and that probably was the difference in the ball game really.\"\n\nAfter Callaway's punt return, UT quarterback Jarrett Guarantano found Josh Palmer for a 16-yard touchdown pass to increase the lead to 14-0. The 14 points were the most UT has scored in the first quarter this season.\n\nBut the early production wasn't a sign of things to come as the Vols offense bogged down for the remainder of the game. The Vols had only 93 yards of total offense in the first half, including 0 rushing yards. Charlotte held its fourth straight opponent to 21 points or fewer.\n\n\"I really thought we were able to control the line of scrimmage. I really wasn't sure of that coming into the game. Our guys up front played really well, and I was really proud of the tackling in the open field,\" Charlotte head coach Brad Lambert said. \"That is thing you worry about playing against an SEC team. I thought they tackled well and did a nice job getting them behind the chains.\"\n\nUT's defense kept Charlotte from posing a serious threat for a comeback. The Vols recorded three sacks in the second half, and a fourth-down stop late in the fourth quarter secured the victory.\n\nGuarantano completed 16 of 21 passes for 172 yards. Palmer had four catches for 71 yards. UT tight end Dominick Wood-Anderson had career highs in catches (3) and yards (53).\n\nCharlotte quarterback Evan Shirreffs completed 13 of 25 passes for 152 yards and threw an interception in the final minute. Charlotte's Benny LeMay rushed 24 times for 81 yards.\n\n\"I think a lot of us underestimated Charlotte,\" Callaway said. \"They're a great team on offense and defense. I think we were ready to get onto Kentucky, and before doing that we had to take care of Charlotte and Charlotte really showed up and proved to us that we can't overlook them.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTennessee: It wasn't pretty, but the Vols did what was expected by beating their third non-Power 5 opponent this season. UT has won 30 straight against non-Power 5 opponents. But the Vols won't be happy with the lackluster performance on both sides of the ball. They will need to bring more energy as they return to SEC play next weekend for the final three games of the regular season.\n\nCharlotte: The 49ers are still searching for their first win over a Power 5 opponent. Charlotte fell to 0-4 all-time against Power 5 programs, including 0-2 against SEC opponents. But the 49ers can take some confidence from their defensive performance. Redshirt sophomore punter Kyle Corbett booted a punt a school-record 75 yards in the fourth quarter that landed at the UT 3-yard line.\n\nANOTHER EJECTION\n\nUT freshman defensive back Alontae Taylor was ejected for targeting for the second time this season when he lunged at Shirreffs in the first quarter while Shirreffs was sliding. The Vols have been penalized for targeting three times this season. Linebacker Daniel Bituli was ejected in the second half against Auburn.\n\n\"I have no idea if it was targeting or what,\" Pruitt said. \"But I obviously don't know what targeting is.... I don't think anybody knows to tell you the truth.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTennessee: hosts Kentucky on Saturday\n\nCharlotte: plays at Marshall on Saturday\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAlabama\u2019s Attorney General Steve Marshall may coast to victory on Nov. 6, but not without the help of some powerful friends from up north.\n\nMarshall, who was appointed to office in 2017, survived a dramatic primary challenge with an influx of $735,000 to his campaign from the political action committee of the Republican Attorneys General Association, a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C.\n\nThose contributions are now the subject of a pending ethics complaint arguing the money violates Alabama\u2019s campaign finance laws \u2014 and they are raising eyebrows because they came from across state lines.\n\n\"The people of Alabama need to know that their attorney general is not working for any out-of-state interests,\" the Democratic challenger, Joe Siegelman, said in October to al.com. Siegelman and Troy King, one of Marshall\u2019s primary opponents, are pressing for a ruling on the complaint.\n\nThe dispute over this hefty chunk of cash also illustrates the state of play in 2018 attorneys general races nationwide: more national money, more competition and more at stake.\n\nAttorney general has always been a springboard to higher office \u2014 the \u201cAG\u201d of attorney general should stand for \u201caspiring governor,\u201d to hear some tell it \u2014 but since 2014, when a comparable number of states chose their attorneys general, the once-staid campaigns have become growing targets for out-of-state influence.\n\nMore: Races that will help decide control of Congress for a decade\n\nMore: Facebook, Twitter make moves to guard against misinformation\n\nCandidates for attorney general this year have raised a third more than at this point in the 2014 campaign cycle, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in Politics. Thirty states are electing attorneys general this year, but races in states such as Wisconsin, Ohio and Florida appear especially close. Their resolution could shape the political landscape of the states and even the future of the Trump administration.\n\nThat\u2019s because attorneys general have realized the power of banding together to file high-profile lawsuits to impact policy beyond their borders, especially since 1998, when over 40 state attorneys general reached a more than $200 billion settlement with four tobacco companies about cigarette marketing that downplayed health risks.\n\nThe practice matured during the Obama years, which saw 62 lawsuits involving multiple attorneys general against the federal government, including suits challenging Affordable Care Act fees and the Clean Air Act, according to data gathered by Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University.\n\nDuring the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency alone, attorneys general working together have already filed or joined 61 suits against the administration, challenging rules such as the EPA rollback of Clean Air Act regulations and child separations at the border.\n\nWorking together allows attorneys general offices to share resources and catapult issues onto the national stage. It\u2019s made the job more visible and somewhat more partisan, says James Tierney, a Democrat who was Maine\u2019s attorney general from 1980 to 1990 and now teaches a course at Harvard Law School on the role of state attorneys general.\n\n\u201cNinety-five percent of what any attorney general does only affects their own state,\u201d Tierney said, referring to responsibilities like overseeing criminal investigations. \u201cThe other 5 percent, whether it\u2019s suing the president or not suing the president, that\u2019s huge, and so that's what attracts the media attention.\u201d\n\nPrevious election cycles operated under a so-called \u201cincumbency rule\u201d where national attorneys general groups from both parties agreed not to lend resources to campaigns targeting incumbents during election years. The agreement helped maintain the goodwill needed to coordinate investigations across state and party lines. Republicans did away with that rule in 2017, though, and unsuccessfully challenged Democrat Mark Herring in Virginia. In 2018, however, it\u2019s Republicans who are on the defensive. Republicans make up 12 of the 18 incumbents running for re-election this year.\n\nThe D.C.-based heavyweights\n\nThis election marks the first cycle with attorneys general associations for the two major parties going head-to-head in many states.\n\nFour years ago, Republican Attorneys General Association was a newly independent group, while the Democratic Attorneys General Association was headquartered in Denver, Colorado, with only part-time staff. Both groups operate as political nonprofits regulated by Section 527 of the IRS, which means they must report all donors who give $200 or more per calendar year. But they don\u2019t indicate which donors\u2019 money goes to which candidate they support, so the original source of the cash helping a specific candidate is often unclear.\n\nRAGA was founded in 1999 by a group of conservative attorneys general, including Alabama\u2019s Bill Pryor, who were frustrated by what they considered activist litigation pursued by their colleagues in the tobacco case. It operated under the umbrella of the Republican State Leadership Committee from 2002 until 2014.\n\nMore: Illinois governor's race could be most expensive in U.S. history\n\nThe group\u2019s largest funder is the Judicial Crisis Network, which has given RAGA $7.2 million since RAGA\u2019s founding. As a 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d group, Judicial Crisis Network doesn\u2019t disclose its donors but IRS documents show it has received around $4 million from the Wellspring Committee, another conservative \u201cdark-money\u201d group. The network spent $1.5 million to support the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in September and also supports conservative judicial candidates at the state level.\n\n\u201cWe proudly support the Republican Attorneys General Association, an organization that has had enormous positive impact on our public policy landscape by fighting for the rule of law and the constitutional principles that protect every American,\u201d Judicial Crisis Network\u2019s Chief Counsel and Policy Director Carrie Severino said in a statement to the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nOther conservative megadonors such as the National Rifle Association ($1.13 million) and Koch Industries ($1.05 million) are among RAGA\u2019s top patrons. Neither responded to requests for comment.\n\nCorporate donors that have been targets of large-scale multistate lawsuits are also among the largest donors to RAGA. Purdue Pharma, manufacturer of the drug OxyContin, gave RAGA over $600,000 since 2014, and health insurer Anthem Inc. gave more than $500,000 since 2015.\n\n\u201cPurdue provides funding to organizations who share our commitment toward addressing the nation\u2019s opioid crisis,\u201d said Bob Josephson, Purdue\u2019s executive director for communications.\n\n\u201cElected officials make decisions that directly affect our ability to make quality health care coverage affordable and to improve the health of the communities we serve,\u201d Anthem\u2019s website explains. \u201cOur active participation in the political process is essential to ensure that we have a voice in those decisions.\u201d\n\nThis year alone, RAGA has raised over $15 million, according to IRS filings.\n\nNot every Republican is happy about RAGA\u2019s clout. \u201cOver time, it\u2019s gone from being an ideological entity and has become more of an extension of the Chamber of Commerce,\u201d said King, a former Alabama attorney general who came within a percentage point of Marshall in the June primary before losing a runoff election in July.\n\nThe association raises money from corporate donors to elect Republicans, he said, \u201cand then you don\u2019t see a lot of Republicans who go and file suit against these big companies.\u201d\n\nBut the group has been undeniably successful in helping to elect Republican attorneys general. Since 1999, the ranks of Republican attorneys general grew from 12 to 27. More Republican attorneys general meant more firepower to push back on Obama-era policies. That, in turn, caused more national Republican donors to start looking at the position as a role that needed to be cultivated.\n\nFor Democrats, the need for a national organization to counter RAGA was clear. DAGA moved its headquarters from Denver to D.C. and hired its first full-time staff members in 2016.\n\n\u201cThere's been a sea change in how attorneys general have been perceived, and we have Donald Trump as our president,\u201d said DAGA Executive Director Sean Rankin. \u201cThese factors are all changing the way this committee is operating.\u201d\n\nThat means not only more money, but more money from progressive sources.\n\nDAGA went from bringing in no more than $4.6 million a year to raising $7.6 million in 2017. This year, it has already raised more than $7 million before Election Day according to the group\u2019s most recent filings with the IRS. The most generous donors in recent years are progressive groups such as Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which has given it $260,000 since 2016.\n\n\u201cMost Democratic donors haven\u2019t known why they would want to give to an attorney general office before,\u201d said Rankin. \u201cIt just wasn't an office that garners that type of limelight.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic group has received contributions from many of the same corporate interests as RAGA but so far in lesser amounts. Purdue Pharma has given DAGA about $185,000 since 2014, for example. DAGA says it counts 37,000 small dollar donors this cycle, its first time running a program to encourage contributions in all sizes.\n\nWisconsin challenge to a GOP incumbent\n\nThese groups are facing off in states such as Wisconsin, where incumbent Republican Brad Schimel is defending his post against Democrat Josh Kaul.\n\nKaul prosecuted drug traffickers and murderers as a former assistant U.S. attorney in Baltimore, where he handled seven trials over four years, a number Schimel says makes Kaul inexperienced for the job of state attorney general. Kaul, the son of former Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager, most recently worked in private practice at Perkins Coie in Madison.\n\nSchimel was elected Wisconsin\u2019s attorney general in 2014, and his tenure has been marked by a backlog of untested rape kits, delays at state crime labs and what his challenger calls a weak response to the opioid crisis.\n\nThese missteps and his participation in ideological lawsuits over national issues led The Capital Times to label Schimel \u201cthe worst attorney general in Wisconsin history.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a massive inflow of money from outside special-interest groups and wealthy self-interested donors keeps Schimel, a scandal-plagued political careerist, in the running,\u201d The Capital Times editorial board wrote in September.\n\nRAGA originally gave the Schimel campaign $44,337, according to an ethics complaint filed by the state\u2019s Democratic Party. This exceeded Wisconsin\u2019s $44,000 contribution limit. RAGA spokesman Zack Roday said the excess donation was \"a mistake that has been corrected.\"\n\nKaul, on the other hand, has received slightly less than $26,000 from DAGA.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that outside spending has impacted the AG\u2019s race in Wisconsin,\u201d said Kaul campaign spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. \u201cBrad Schimel has repeatedly put special interests\n\nahead of the interests of Wisconsinites, and now RAGA is spending big to support his campaign.\u201d\n\nThe Schimel campaign has not responded to multiple requests for comment. But Campaign Manager Johnny Koremenos said in a statement on the Schimel campaign website last month that \u201cJosh Kaul\u2019s record is weak, thin and blatantly partisan. That\u2019s why every day our team grows, while the Kaul campaign relies on help from out-of-state special interests.\u201d\n\nBoth have attracted attention from other deep-pocketed out-of-state donors. California-based billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer gave Kaul $10,000. Schimel has received $20,000 from Illinois-based Richard Holson III, CEO of Guarantee Trust Life Insurance, and $17,500 from Dick Uihlein, the wealthy conservative activist from Illinois. None responded to requests to comment.\n\nBoth RAGA and DAGA have spent money on the Wisconsin race outside of the candidates\u2019 campaigns as well. RAGA planned to commit $3 million to an ad campaign, Roday said, and DAGA will spend $2 million on ads backing Kaul. DAGA\u2019s most recent ad accusing Schimel of being too lenient on child molesters while serving as Waukesha County prosecutor was pulled from one station after lawyers for Schimel called it inaccurate. DAGA stands by the ad and wrote its own letter to TV stations in response.\n\nThe rancor is a clear shift from the days when the incumbency rule largely would have shielded an incumbent such as Schimel from such campaign brush fires.\n\n\u201cIs it a little bit more contentious? Maybe,\u201d said DAGA\u2019s Rankin. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been dropping bombs on Democratic AG candidates for years and we have the ability to fight back, and we\u2019re aggressive with it. Because winning a seat matters.\u201d\n\nOhio\u2019s tight race for an open seat\n\nOne of the highest profile attorney general races in the country \u2014 and among November\u2019s most expensive \u2014 is taking place in Ohio, where Democrat Steve Dettelbach faces Republican Dave Yost for an open seat. The Yost campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe opioid crisis, which has hit the Buckeye State hard, looms large over the campaign. Yost has received $10,000 from drug manufacturer Pfizer\u2019s PAC, while Dettelbach has sworn off its cash.\n\n\u201cOur support for Dave Yost is based on his commitment to defend the rights of Ohio patients and consumers,\u201d Pfizer\u2019s Senior Director of Media Relations Sharon Castillo said in a statement.\n\nDettelbach\u2019s large out-of-state donations include about $16,700 from the United Food and Commercial Workers and roughly $12,700 from DAGA\u2019s federal PAC.\n\n\u201cSteve Dettelbach will be an attorney general who protects good jobs and better wages across Ohio. We endorse him with enthusiasm and look forward to helping him win this race,\u201d the UFCW\u2019s local chapters said in a statement.\n\nRAGA and DAGA are both funding advertising in Ohio, including a $2 million ad buy from DAGA and a $1.4 million commitment from RAGA.\n\nYet another, more mysterious group called the Center for Individual Freedom funded more than $300,000 worth of TV ads in support of Yost, the GOP nominee, according to contracts filed with TV stations in Dayton and Columbus. Based in Alexandria, Virginia, it \u201cseeks to focus public, legislative and judicial attention on the rule of law as embodied in the federal and state constitutions,\u201d according to its website.\n\nThe group was formed by former tobacco executives in 1998, the same year as the giant tobacco settlement, to fight government restrictions on smoking, but its scope has since widened. It doesn\u2019t disclose its donors and advocates against transparency measures, but tax records have revealed contributions from groups such as the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and Karl Rove\u2019s Crossroads GPS. Issue briefs on CFIF\u2019s website call Democratic positions on health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions \u201ca big lie\u201d and claim \u201cclimate alarmism\u201d harms consumers.\n\nThe group also funded over $900,000 worth of TV ads during the 2014 election cycle attacking one candidate for Arkansas attorney general while supporting two members of the Michigan Supreme Court. It did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAlabama fight over out-of-state money\n\nIn Alabama, this year\u2019s attorney general candidates have raised about 75 percent more than when Luther Strange ran for re-election in 2014. Marshall alone has raised more than $3.8 million, according to state campaign finance records.\n\nAside from the $735,000 contribution from RAGA, Marshall\u2019s largest contributor is the PAC of the Business Council of Alabama, a group that represents the state\u2019s business community, most notably Regions Bank and Alabama Power. The council\u2019s $355,100 to Marshall is more than three times what it contributed to the re-election campaign of Alabama\u2019s Republican Gov. Kay Ivey. Alabama Power\u2019s Employees State PAC also gave Marshall $85,000 independently of the council, according to filings with the Alabama Secretary of State.\n\nA spokesperson for Alabama Power said its PAC donates to candidates who understand the concerns of its customers, employees and shareholders. The Business Council of Alabama did not respond to requests for comment, and Regions Bank declined to comment.\n\nHis GOP primary challenger, King, raised $2.2 million, while Marshall\u2019s Democratic opponent in the general election, Siegelman, has raised more than $606,000, much of it via small donations. About 83 percent of Siegelman\u2019s campaign funds come from within the state, compared with 74 percent for Marshall\u2019s, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of state campaign finance data.\n\nDAGA has yet to invest serious money into the race. Marshall is expected to win the general election handily.\n\nRAGA\u2019s contribution represents about 20 percent of Marshall\u2019s total fundraising. King sought a temporary restraining order barring the Marshall campaign from spending the RAGA money, arguing Alabama\u2019s Fair Campaign Practices Act of 2010 banned political action committees active in the state\u2019s elections from taking contributions from other PACs. Filings with the IRS show RAGA accepts contributions from super PACs such as the General Electric PAC and JP Morgan PAC.\n\nThe lawsuit was dismissed. But King and Siegelman continue to press the Alabama Ethics Commission to issue a ruling. Two Alabama lawyers have also asked the Montgomery district attorney to investigate the transaction.\n\nRAGA spokesman Roday said that it was proud to support Marshall\u2019s primary campaign and it complied with Alabama and federal law.\n\nThe Marshall campaign denies any wrongdoing, arguing that RAGA Action Fund is a federal PAC subject to federal law, not Alabama\u2019s ban on PAC-to-PAC transfers.\n\n\u201cEvery contribution to Steve Marshall for Alabama has been received in a legal manner, consistent with the guidelines set forth from the Alabama Secretary of State's Office,\u201d said Julia Mazzone, a spokeswoman for the Marshall campaign.\n\nPrevious attorney general campaigns, including King\u2019s in 2006, have had trouble with RAGA contributions. In 2014, Strange\u2019s campaign returned a $50,000 donation from a RAGA-affiliated PAC within 24 hours of his opponent\u2019s complaint that it violated the state\u2019s ban on PAC-to-PAC contributions.\n\nAnd a complaint was filed against King\u2019s own 2006 re-election campaign for accepting $100,000 from the Republican State Leadership Committee while it still housed the RAGA super PAC, because his opponent claimed it broke the state\u2019s then-cap on corporate contributions. That complaint was dismissed and the corporate contribution limit was removed in 2010.\n\nRAGA\u2019s contribution to Marshall\u2019s campaign is more than seven times what it gave King.\n\nTo King, it\u2019s clear why RAGA and its corporate backers would support Marshall over him this time around. \u201cWhen I was attorney general I sued 76 drug companies and I sued BP,\u201d King said. \u201cThat's not a Republican thing to do in their minds.\u201d\n\nChris Zubak-Skees and Joe Yerardi contributed.\n\nThis story is from The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative media organization in Washington, D.C.

West Virginia defeated Texas 42-41. (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 The last time West Virginia quarterback Will Grier ran for the corner of the end zone against Texas, a dive resulted in a gnarly broken finger that ended his season.\n\nHe stayed upright this time, untouched as he scrambled for a 2-point conversion that gave No. 12 West Virginia a 42-41 win at No. 15 Texas on Saturday that kept the Mountaineers in first in the Big 12 as they try for their first conference championship.\n\nGrier's scramble for the pylon came after he threaded a 33-yard touchdown pass to Gary Jennings with 16 seconds left, a perfect throw that Jennings caught in stride in the back of the end zone behind two defenders.\n\nInstead of going for the tie, Mountaineers coach Dana Holgorsen dialed up a game-winner. Holgorsen and Grier said the decision was made even before the final drive started.\n\n\"It was an easy decision,\" Holgorsen said. \"If you put the fate of the game in (Grier's) hands, I feel pretty good about it.... We've had this 2-point conversion in our back pocket all year.\"\n\nIt still took two snaps to win it.\n\nOn the first, Grier connected with Davis Sills on a quick slant. West Virginia (7-1, 5-1, No. 13 CFP) celebrated but officials ruled the play dead because Texas had called timeout just before the snap. So Grier had to do it again.\n\nSills was covered the second time. Grier took a step up in the pocket, and then saw a clearing to his left because the Texas safety had dropped off into double coverage on Sills. He held the ball up as he crossed the goal line before slamming it into the stadium wall.\n\n\"I had four different options on that play,\" Grier said. \"I went with the fourth one, which was me running ... I stayed on my feet, which was good. Whatever it takes to win.\"\n\nWest Virginia linebacker David Long couldn't watch.\n\n\"I turned my back. All of a sudden, I heard the crowd get silent,\" Long said. \"That told me everything I needed to know.\"\n\nTexas coach Tom Herman didn't seem to care for Grier's pre-score celebration.\n\n\"I thought taunting before you cross the goal line negated a score,\" Herman said. \"I've got to brush up on my rules and get some questions answered.\"\n\nSills caught touchdown passes of 60 and 18 yards for the Mountaineers.\n\nEhlinger passed for 356 yards and three scores and also ran for a touchdown for Texas (6-3, 4-2, No. 17 CFP), which has lost two in a row after three weeks in first place in the Big 12.\n\n\"The silver lining is we play in the Big 12. We're not out of any race at this point,\" Herman said. \"We certainly don't control our own destiny.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWest Virginia: The Mountaineers got a huge effort in the running game to complement Grier, and the defense held on just enough to force the Longhorns to kick two field goals that kept them in range for Grier's late-game magic. The Mountaineers ran through the Texas defense for 232 yards. Martell Pettaway rushed for 121 yards on nine carries and scored on runs of 55 and 13 yards.\n\nTexas: Injuries have become a problem while Texas has stumbled into the second half of its season. Starting safety Brandon Jones didn't play because he aggravated an ankle injury before the game at the team hotel, starting cornerback Davante Davis was knocked out on the first series with a shoulder and neck sprain and edge rusher Breckyn Hager dislocated his left shoulder in the first half.\n\nHORNS DOWN\n\nWest Virginia was penalized 14 times, eight in the first quarter alone. None were bigger than a pair of calls after Sills scored on a 60-yard touchdown pass.\n\nSills was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct for flashing a \"horns down\" hand sign after the score. Then starting left tackle Yodny Cajuste was ejected after another unsportsmanlike call for throwing a punch on the extra point. The Mountaineers kicked off from their own 3 and Texas used three plays to drive the short field for a touchdown.\n\nBig 12 Assistant Commissioner Bob Burda said the penalty for the \"horns down\" hand signal is \"solely at the official's discretion\" and he is unaware of whether teams have been warned not to do it when playing Texas.\n\n\"Here is what I'm disappointed about: We communicated with the refs if that thing was going to get called. I guess there was miscommunication,\" Holgorsen said, declining to say what game officials had told him before kickoff.\n\nNO PRESSURE\n\nTexas couldn't get to Grier and gave up 578 total yards. The Mountaineers didn't allow a sack despite losing Cajuste. Backup left tackle Kelby Wickline had a huge game against Texas sack leader defensive end Charles Omenihu, who had two tackles and no quarterback hurries.\n\n\"Lose your all-American tackle, it doesn't bode well for what could happen,\" Holgorsen said. \"We schemed some things up front, blocked hard. That's why we moved the ball.\"\n\nPOLL POSITION\n\nWest Virginia should get a boost for a big road win against a much improved Texas team compared to last season. The Longhorns likely drift back toward the bottom of the Top 25 after another game where the defense struggled again.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWest Virginia hosts TCU next Saturday.\n\nTexas travels to Texas Tech next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Jim Vertuno at https://twitter.com/jimvertuno\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Randy Holt) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Cole Custer's first career victory at Homestead last year wasn't for the NASCAR Xfinity championship.\n\nWhen he gets back to South Florida in two weeks, the 20-year-old Custer will have a chance to win a title there.\n\nCuster locked in one of the four championship-contending spots for the season finale with his second career win. He regained the lead and won at Texas on Saturday when he pushed past rookie driver Tyler Reddick on the final lap soon after a restart.\n\n\"We haven't won all year but we have been so close. It starts to frustrate you,\" Custer said. \"We kept going and this is a perfect time to do it.\"\n\nThe final restart with two laps left came after the 13th caution, the most ever in an Xfinity race at Texas.

The late contact with Bell certainly didn't help.\n\n\"Had damage from lap one of the race when they had that big stack up and I nursed that damage,\" Cindric said. \"That damage got worse and then our contact with the 20 later made that worse.

(AP Photo/Holly Hart) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) \u2014 The hot seat Illinois coach Lovie Smith has found himself on lately cooled down a bit on Saturday as Illinois beat Minnesota 55-31 in a game that saw some impressive and long scoring runs.\n\nMeanwhile, things are heating up for Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck, who has watched his team drop five of its last six games.\n\nIllinois managed to win in dramatic fashion.\n\nReggie Corbin rushed for 213 yards and two touchdowns \u2014 both coming on runs of more than 70 yards \u2014 to become the first Illini player to rush for two 70-yard-plus touchdowns in a single game since 1944.\n\n\"Reggie plays like that every game,\" Smith said. \"Week in and week out, he just plays football for us.\"\n\nIt was Corbin's fourth 100-yard rushing game in the last five games.\n\nMinnesota (4-5, 1-5 Big Ten) had trouble all game stopping the run, giving up 430 yards and five touchdowns on the ground. Illinois racked up 646 total yards of offense.\n\n\"It's a lack of consistency that's hurting us,\" Fleck said. \"And it's all over the field, on offense, defense, special teams. This was just not a good football game for us. And that's on me.\"\n\nThe 55 points were the most for Illinois (4-5, 2-4) since Smith took over as head coach before the 2016 season.\n\n\"We didn't tackle anyone,\" Fleck said. \"I think our speed got exposed on defense. They were running away from us.\"\n\nIllinois quarterback AJ Bush managed the game well and accounted for four Illinois touchdowns, going 18 of 25 for 216 yards passing with two touchdowns and one interception. Bush rushed for 127 yards on 14 carries and two more touchdowns.\n\n\"AJ played well, both running and passing,\" Smith said. \"He's shown us what kind of a leader he is.\"\n\nRedshirt freshman Tanner Morgan got the start again at quarterback for Minnesota after an excellent performance in beating Indiana last week in his first career start. True freshman Zack Annexstad won the job in fall camp, hurt his ankle in the third game, played through it rather ineffectively and then suffered an unspecified midsection injury in a loss at Nebraska on Oct. 20.\n\nMorgan had the first 300-yard passing game last week for the Gophers since 2015 and may have secured the starting role even if Annexstad gets healthy.\n\nMorgan was 14 of 27 for 258 yards and two touchdowns against Illinois.\n\nIllinois led 24-17 at the half.\n\nSandwiched between the Illini scoring runs to open the game was a 12-play Minnesota drive that resulted in a 4-yard touchdown run by Mohamed Ibrahim.\n\nQUICK START\n\nIllinois' first two possessions resulted in two 72-yard touchdown runs \u2014 one by Corbin and the other by Dre Brown. Both came on second-and-long and both backs were untouched once they cleared the line of scrimmage. Corbin later ripped off a 77-yard scoring run.\n\nBrown rushed for 92 yards and one touchdown. He was playing in lieu of injured starting running back Mike Epstein, who generally shares carries with Corbin.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nTrailing 31-17 midway through the third quarter, the Gophers were starting to click offensively and were driving when running back Seth Green fumbled on the Illinois 30-yard line.\n\nOn the next play, Bush lofted a pass to Daniel Barker for an easy score and a 38-17 lead.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMinnesota: Needs six wins to nail down a bowl bid, and Saturday's defeat makes it all the more difficult. With three games left, against Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin, they need wins in two of them. Not impossible, but not easy.\n\nIllinois: Calling the defense after the abrupt resignation last week of coordinator Hardy Nickerson, Smith acquitted himself well, with his defense giving up 438 yards, substantially less than in past weeks.\n\n\"We needed to come back and show we can play defense,\" Smith said. \"I think we're getting closer.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMinnesota: Hosts Purdue on Saturday.\n\nIllinois: Travels to Nebraska next week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Wade Payne) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Marquez Callaway returned a punt for a touchdown and Tennessee's defense nearly pitched a shutout as the Vols defeated Charlotte 14-3 in their final nonconference game of the season Saturday.\n\nIn the first meeting between the programs, Tennessee (4-5) kept its bowl hopes alive while snapping a two-game losing streak in front of a paltry announced homecoming crowd of 86,753 at Neyland Stadium.\n\nIf Tennessee was hoping for a confidence-boosting offensive performance against a non-Power 5 opponent, the Vols didn't find it against Charlotte (4-5).\n\nThe Vols were limited to just 192 total yards and held scoreless through the final three quarters in equaling their season-low in points scored.\n\nCharlotte entered the game ranked sixth in the FBS in rushing defense (88.9 yards), and improved its standing. The 49ers held the Vols to only 20 net rushing yards on 26 attempts for a 0.8 average per rush.\n\n\"We didn't make any explosive plays and we really struggled to be consistent running the football. That is not a good recipe for success,\" Tennessee head coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \"We did find a way to create a positive play on special teams and that probably was the difference in the ball game really.\"\n\nCallaway's punt return sparked the offense early. The junior wide receiver sprinted a career-high 82 yards for a touchdown to give the Vols a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. It was Callaway's second career punt return for a touchdown.\n\nUT quarterback Jarrett Guarantano found Josh Palmer for a 16-yard touchdown pass to increase the lead to 14-0. The 14 points were the most UT has scored in the first quarter this season.\n\nBut the early production wasn't a sign of things to come as the Vols offense bogged down for the remainder of the game. UT had only 93 yards of total offense in the first half, including 0 rushing yards. Until UT's final offensive drive in the fourth quarter, the Vols were in negative rushing yardage.\n\n\"I really thought we were able to control the line of scrimmage. I really wasn't sure of that coming into the game. Our guys up front played really well, and I was really proud of the tackling in the open field,\" Charlotte head coach Brad Lambert said. \"That is thing you worry about playing against an SEC team. I thought they tackled well and did a nice job getting them behind the chains.\"\n\nUT's defense kept Charlotte from posing a serious threat for a comeback. The Vols recorded three sacks in the second half, and a fourth-down stop late in the fourth quarter secured the victory.\n\nGuarantano completed 16 of 21 passes for 172 yards. Palmer had four catches for 71 yards. UT tight end Dominick Wood-Anderson had career highs in catches (3) and yards (53).\n\nCharlotte quarterback Evan Shirreffs completed 13 of 25 passes for 152 yards and threw an interception in the final minute. Charlotte's Benny LeMay rushed 24 times for 81 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTennessee: It wasn't pretty, but the Vols did what was expected by beating their third non-Power 5 opponent this season. UT has won 30 straight against non-Power 5 opponents. But the Vols won't be happy with the lackluster performance on both sides of the ball. They will need to bring more energy as they return to SEC play next weekend for the final three games of the regular season.\n\nCharlotte: The 49ers are still searching for their first win over a Power 5 opponent. Charlotte fell to 0-4 all-time against Power 5 programs, including 0-2 against SEC opponents. But the 49ers can take some confidence from their defensive performance. They've held four straight opponents to 21 points or fewer.

(AP Photo/Chris Seward) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina State corrected many of the problems that had plagued the Wolfpack during two straight losses, namely by getting off to a fast start and running the ball well.\n\nAs for Florida State, there was no such strong response \u2014 only a second straight lopsided loss that inched the Seminoles closer to the end of decades-long streaks of success.\n\nFreshman Ricky Person Jr. scored three touchdowns while Jakobi Meyers had a big receiving day to help the Wolfpack beat the Seminoles 47-28 on Saturday, making the Wolfpack bowl eligible for the fifth straight year.\n\nMeyers had nine catches for 125 yards and a score for the Wolfpack (6-2, 3-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), who scored the first 17 points and never looked back in a one-sided show.\n\n\"I just thought it was really good execution in a lot of ways,\" Wolfpack coach Dave Doeren said.\n\nDoeren was right. The Wolfpack moved the chains against the nation's 12th-ranked run defense (102.9 yards), avoided major mistakes and got reliable kicking production when drives stalled.\n\nNot that there were many, considering N.C. State had a season-high scoring output.\n\nThe ground game certainly stood out. Person scored on 1- and 4-yard runs in the first half after missing last week's loss at No. 22 Syracuse due to injury. And Reggie Gallaspy II ran for a career-best 106 yards, part of a 177-yard output that surpassed the combined total from the losses to No. 2 Clemson followed by the Orange (172).\n\n\"It makes just everything a lot more fun, to be honest, as an offensive lineman,\" Wolfpack center Garrett Bradbury said. \"When you can just at will drive down the field running the ball, and they know it's coming most of the time, it's just a good feeling.\"\n\nFSU's James Blackman threw for a career-high 421 yards and four scores in starting for Deondre Francois, with two going to Tamorrion Terry. But it didn't stop the Seminoles (4-5, 2-5) from taking a fourth loss by at least 19 points this year.\n\n\"We've got to learn to translate our effort and the way we work the sidelines to the football field,\" first-year FSU coach Willie Taggart said. \"That's something we didn't do.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nFSU: Things couldn't have been worse in last week's 59-10 home loss to No. 2 Clemson, a performance that had Taggart openly questioning his team's effort and whether some players quit. The Seminoles didn't play anywhere near well enough to win this one, either, including 16 penalties for 121 yards to continue their trend of being among the nation's most frequently flagged teams.\n\n\"I love this football team, I love our guys,\" Taggart said. \"They're trying to do the things we're asking them to do. ... Our guys know how to play football. We've got to teach them how to win now.\"\n\nN.C. State: Put simply, it was a clean performance. The Wolfpack avoided turnovers, allowed no sacks, committed just two penalties through the first three quarters and answered any FSU push. Getting the 17-0 lead was big, too, after falling behind 14-0 at Clemson and 24-7 at Syracuse in the first quarter.\n\n\"I feel like we have the ability to bounce back after two losses and keep going,\" Meyers said. \"In the past once we lost to Clemson it was a real downfall for the rest of the season. But I think this team is special.\"\n\nSTREAK WATCH\n\nFlorida State's long streaks of winning seasons and bowl appearances are in serious jeopardy.\n\nFSU hasn't had a losing season since 1976 and has been in a bowl game for 36 straight seasons, with the last bowl-less season coming in 1981. The Seminoles have to win two of their last three \u2014 all against AP Top 25 teams \u2014 to become bowl eligible.\n\nPERSON'S DAY\n\nPerson, who provides a big-play complement to Gallaspy's power in the run game, ran for 42 yards and capped his day with a short TD catch from Ryan Finley to make it 44-21 with 11:10 left.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFSU: The Seminoles visit No. 3 Notre Dame next Saturday.\n\nN.C.

(AP Photo/Matt Bell) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) \u2014 Travis Levy went from a lightly used backup to the focal point of No. 24 Boston College's run-first offense, and he responded by running the Eagles into one of their biggest games in years.\n\nTaking over after star AJ Dillon tweaked an ankle injury, Levy for ran 75 yards and two touchdowns as Boston College beat Virginia Tech 31-21, setting them up for a huge home game against No. 2 Clemson next week.\n\n\"I'm ready every game,\" the sophomore said. He started the day with just 29 carries for 102 yards with no touchdowns in the first eight games. \"Next man up mentality. That's what it is.\"\n\nDillon added 96 yards and a touchdown for BC (7-2, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 22 CFP), which will face the Tigers with first place in the ACC's Atlantic Division on the line.\n\n\"We have an opportunity to play the No. 2 team in the country that's playing lights out football,\" BC coach Steve Addazio said.\n\nThe Eagles looked pretty good in their tuneup, limiting the Hokies to 32 yards in the third quarter and erasing a 14-7 deficit with 21 unanswered points after halftime.\n\n\"The second half, everyone felt the energy throughout the locker room,\" said BC's Brandon Sebastian, who had a key interception. \"We just kept swinging and stayed in there and put them away.\"\n\nRyan Willis threw for 281 yards with three touchdown passes for Virginia Tech (4-4, 3-2), but the Hokies lost their third straight at home for the first time since 1992. It came on a day when they could have moved into a share of first place in the Coastal Division with a victory.\n\nLevy scored on a 29-yard run midway through the third quarter to tie the game at 14, and his 1-yard run with 8:51 to play made it 28-14. In between, Anthony Brown got them the lead with a 22-yard TD pass to Korab Idrizi after an interception by Sebastian.\n\nOn the interception, Willis hit Damon Hazleton but the ball went off the receiver and right into the hands of Sebastian.\n\nWillis completed 25 of 42 passes and ran for 49 more yards. His touchdowns \u2014 26 yards to Hazleton, 4 yards to Eric Kumah and 14 yards to Tre Turner \u2014 all came when he threw the ball in their direction in one-on-one coverage. But the Hokies gained just 111 yards on 36 carries.\n\n\"In this game, if you can only do one thing, they won't let you do that for very long,\" coach Justin Fuente said.\n\nBoth quarterbacks missed on what could have been long scoring passes. Brown had Michael Walker well behind the secondary but overthrew him on what would have been a 90-yard play in the second quarter, and Willis underthrew Turner in the middle of the field on a would-be 79-yard scoring play in the third quarter.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nBoston College: The Eagles' play-calling was curious at times. Dillon ran for three and then 17 yards on their first two plays, but three consecutive pass plays that followed yielded only a yard and a punt. Dillon carried seven times \u2014 half his first-half total \u2014 on their lone scoring drive before halftime.\n\nVirginia Tech: The Hokies already inexperienced defense has been worn thin by injuries. They began the day with leading tackler Rayshard Ashby dressed but not playing, nose tackle Jarrod Hewitt and OLB Dylan Rivers also sitting out with injuries and No. 2 tackler, LB Khalil Ladler, missing the first half because of a targeting call. They then lost cornerback Bryce Watts to a broken forearm and backup nose tackle Xavier Burke to an Achilles injury.\n\nEASY, TIGER\n\nAddazio had an amusing answer when asked if he's seen how Clemson fared earlier in the day. They beat Louisville 77-16.\n\n\"I did see it flash up on the board,\" he said. \"I think it was 77? You just want to ruin my night. Can I enjoy this game, maybe get on the plane and have one of those awful sandwiches, just feel good for a few minutes?\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Eagles return home, maybe to host ESPN's \"College GameDay.\"\n\nVirginia Tech heads onto the road to face Pittsburgh still with a chance in the Coastal Division matchup.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) \u2014 No. 5 Michigan wanted to do more than just beat No. 14 Penn State.\n\nThe Wolverines wanted to win big, getting revenge after getting routed and humiliated against the Nittany Lions last year.\n\nMichigan got what it wanted.\n\nShea Patterson accounted for three touchdowns and the Wolverines put together a dominant performance on defense in a 42-7 rout against Penn State on Saturday.\n\n\"If we had a chance, we were going to run it up, too,\" Patterson said.\n\nThe Wolverines (8-1, 6-0 Big Ten, No. 5 CFP) moved a step closer toward their goals of winning a conference championship for the first time since 2004 and earning their first spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"We're the team to beat in the Big Ten,\" proclaimed defensive end Chase Winovich , who has said the team is on a revenge tour to beat the four conference teams it lost to last season. \"That's not a controversial statement. It's just, I think, that's a fact at this point.\"\n\nThe Nittany Lions (6-3, 3-3, No. 14 CFP) scored with 1:59 left, avoiding getting shut out for the first time since 2001 against Michigan.\n\n\"Defensively, they kicked our butts,\" coach James Franklin said.\n\nJim Harbaugh did what he could to prevent Penn State from scoring at all, challenging a call on its last drive and calling timeout twice.\n\nMichigan, clearly, was motivated to beat the Nittany Lions after they won 42-13 last year and tried to score a touchdown on its last play.\n\n\"It was personal right from the start,\" Karan Higdon said.\n\nHigdon ran for 132 yards and a score that put the Wolverines up 35-0 early in the fourth quarter. He has run for 100-plus yards in seven straight games, one shy of the school record set by Mike Hart in 2007.\n\n\"I think it's time for him to get nominated for some big-time awards,\" Patterson said.\n\nMichigan's defense held Penn State to 186 yards and forced three turnovers, including Tommy Stevens' interception that was returned 62 yards by Brandon Watson for its second score in the final minute of the third quarter. It was Watson's second pick-6 of the season, joining Lance Dottin (1991) as the only players to do that twice in a year.\n\nThe Nittany Lions started banged-up quarterback Trace McSorley and he was 5 of 13 for 83 yards with an interception and a fumble. McSorley played with an injured right knee in last week's win against Iowa. He shared time and rotated with Stevens, who was 3 of 4 for 35 yards. Stevens scored on an 8-yard run late in the game.\n\n\"When (Stevens) threw the interception there, we felt like we needed to put Trace back in,\" Franklin said. \"Obviously, you make the decision and you probably could've made the change a little bit earlier. The way they were pressuring us and loading the box, having the ball with Trace's mobility was critical.\"\n\nPatterson was 11 of 17 for 144 yards with two touchdown passes, a 23-yard throw to Donovan Peoples-Jones in the second quarter and a 7-yard strike to Zach Gentry. He ran 11 times, often on read-option plays , for 42 yards, including a 1-yard TD midway through the first quarter.\n\n\"With Shea, they've added another element to their package, getting on the perimeter,\" Franklin said.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nPatterson was replaced in the fourth quarter by redshirt freshman Dylan McCaffrey, who broke his collarbone.\n\n\"He was doing so well,\" Harbaugh said. \"I'm a little sad about that.\"\n\nMichigan defensive end Rashan Gary returned from a three-game absence because of an injured right shoulder and receiver Tarik Black took a big step in his comeback from foot surgery by catching a touchdown pass that was negated by a penalty.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nPenn State: Franklin, in his fifth season, will be challenged to provide an upbeat outlook about the state of his program after losing for the third time in five games and getting routed as a ranked team.\n\nMichigan: Harbaugh's fourth team is positioned to have a special season. The Wolverines have a pair of tuneups at Rutgers and against Indiana to get ready to close the regular season at No. 8 Ohio State.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nMichigan will likely move up a spot because No. 4 LSU lost to top-ranked Alabama.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Purdue kicker Spencer Evans waited impatiently for a second chance.\n\nWhen the opportunity finally arrived Saturday, he was ready, willing and spot on.\n\nThe senior made a 25-yard field goal with 8 seconds left to give Purdue a 38-36 upset over No. 19 Iowa, helping the surging Boilermakers move within one game of becoming bowl-eligible and back into contention for the Big Ten's West Division crown.\n\n\"This is something I've pictured over and over again,\" Evans said. \"I just have to give credit to the guys for putting me in that position. They made it a nice, makeable field goal for me.\"\n\nThe big finish came exactly one week after Evans endured a nightmare at Michigan State.\n\nHe missed a 57-yarder at the end of the first half following a 5-yard penalty against the Boilermakers and had a 41-yard attempt to tie the game blocked late in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis time, Evans and the field goal unit were virtually flawless after quarterback David Blough marched the Boilermakers 43 yards and put the ball on the left hash mark for the decisive field goal.\n\nBlough was 23 of 32 with 333 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions while hooking up with Terry Wright for three scores.\n\nBut it was Evans' kick that gave Purdue (6-2, 4-2) its third win over a ranked opponent this season, the first time the Boilermakers achieved that feat in 15 years, and within one game of division-leading Northwestern.\n\n\"Great job by our field goal unit of protecting and great job by Spencer kicking it right dead middle,\" coach Jeff Brohm said.\n\nThe Hawkeyes (6-3, 3-3, No. 16 CFP) lost their second straight road game and another chance to celebrate coach Kirk Ferentz's 150th conference victory. Woody Hayes, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Bo Schembechler and Joe Paterno are the only Big Ten coaches in the exclusive club.\n\nNate Stanley threw for 275 yards with one TD and ran for another score but it was Iowa's vaunted defense that let down the Hawkeyes.\n\nIt was burned repeatedly for big plays and couldn't come up with one last stop after Purdue took over at the 50-yard line with 4:30 to play.\n\n\"That was a really tough, tough loss for us to go through,\" Ferentz said. \"I think our team played extremely hard right to the finish. Not sure what more (the players) could have done.\"\n\nStopping Wright would have helped. He caught six passes for 146 yards and became the first Purdue receiver to catch three TD passes in a game since Gary Bush in 2012.\n\nStill, the defense gave the Hawkeyes a fighting chance.\n\nTrailing 35-23 after Wright's final score, a 3-yard TD catch, Mekhi Sargent scored on a 1-yard run to make it 35-30. Amani Hooker picked off Blough on the next offensive play and had a touchdown return called back because of holding.\n\nSargent wound up scoring on a 1-yard plunge a few minutes later to make it 36-30 with 10:19 to play after Iowa's second 2-point conversion failed.\n\nBut the Boilermakers took advantage of a 31-yard punt by methodically moving down the field, positioning Evans for the kick he and his coach had been dreaming about.\n\n\"We had a kick blocked the last game that hurt us,\" Brohm said. \"We found a way to make this one.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIowa: After watching their playoff aspirations vanish with last week's loss at Penn State, the Hawkeyes' Big Ten title hopes have now likely faded away, too.\n\nPurdue: The Boilermakers are 3-1 against ranked teams this season, but there's plenty still at stake with two winnable road games and a home date against Wisconsin left on the schedule.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nIowa: Probably will fall out of the Top 25 after losing in back-to-back weeks by a total of eight points.\n\nPurdue: Another win over a Top 25 foe should turn some heads but probably won't make a strong enough case to get the Boilermakers back into the Top 25.\n\nSTATISTICALLY SPEAKING\n\nIowa: Stanley moved into the top 10 on the school's career list in yards passing, surpassing Kyle McCann. He also passed Matt Sherman (42) for No. 4 on the school's career list for TD passes. ... The Hawkeyes gave up a season-high point total and a season-high for yards allowed (434).\n\nPurdue: Markell Jones scored on a 1-yard run in the first half to move past Otis Armstrong (17) for No. 10 on the school's career list. ... Wright scored on plays of 41 and 82 yards in addition to the 3-yard TD catch. ...

The Midshipmen (2-7, 1-4) dropped their sixth straight and were blanked for the first time since 2012.\n\n\"Getting shut out was embarrassing,\" said quarterback Zach Abey, who made his first start of the season.\n\nDesmond Ridder ran for a touchdown and handed off to Michael Warren II for two more before twisting his right leg while getting tackled late in the first half. He limped off, and Hayden Moore took over and threw an 11-yard touchdown pass for a 28-0 halftime lead.\n\nRidder returned for the start of the second half and threw a 55-yard TD pass on Cincinnati's opening drive, then was on the sideline the rest of the way. He finished 13 of 17 for 178 yards, and he ran seven times for 66 yards.\n\nNavy switched quarterbacks after its 44-22 loss to No. 3 Notre Dame last week. It didn't make a difference as Navy's blockers got pushed around by a defense that ranks 11th nationally against the run. Abey was sacked all three times he tried to throw in the first half , when Navy managed 57 yards rushing.\n\n\"I started Zach just trying to get a spark,\" coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \"We needed to get something going.\"\n\nNavy's last shutout loss was 12-0 to San Jose State on Sept. 29, 2012.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen won't be going to a bowl for the first time since 2011, when they finished 5-7. Navy had gone to a bowl in 15 of the previous 15 seasons.\n\nCincinnati: The Bearcats remain in the chase for the league title. They have a favorable closing stretch, with three of their last four games at home. They were ranked for two weeks before A 24-17 overtime loss at Temple knocked them out of the Top 25 two weeks ago.\n\nMIDSHIPMEN SLUMP\n\nNavy has its longest losing streak since also dropping six in a row in 2011. It has lost 10 in a row on the road since a 31-21 home win over Tulsa on Sept. 30, 2017.\n\nHELLO OHIO\n\nNavy was 3-0 in the series, with all the games play at Annapolis. The last time the Midshipmen played in Ohio was 2013, when they lost to Kareem Hunt's Toledo team 45-44 in double overtime.\n\nJUST SHORT\n\nThe Midshipmen came up short on fourth-and-1 and a pair of fourth-and-2 plays.\n\nNO OVERTIME FOR ONCE\n\nThe Bearcats were coming off back-to-back overtime games, the loss at Temple and a 26-20 win at SMU last week on James Wiggins' 86-yard interception return in OT.\n\nWARREN CLOSES IN\n\nWarren's touchdown runs of 8 and 1 yard gave him 14 for the season, three shy of the school record. On his 1-yard run, he took a direct snap, jumped and faked a pass, then ran straight ahead for the score. David Small set the school record with 17 touchdowns rushing in 1993.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNavy: Plays at No. 9 UCF next Saturday.

(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Georgia believed it had a point to prove.\n\nBulldogs running backs D'Andre Swift and Elijah Holyfield spent all week hearing about the rushing prowess of Kentucky's Benny Snell Jr. Georgia's defensive players kept fielding questions about their inability to stop the run or rush the passer consistently.\n\nThey responded Saturday with a performance that convincingly showed Georgia remains the class of the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division. Swift ran for a career-high 156 yards and two touchdowns as the sixth-ranked Bulldogs defeated No. 11 Kentucky 34-17 to clinch the SEC East title.\n\n\"I think people had started doubting us,\" Swift said. \"We just tried to silence the critics.\"\n\nSwift had an 83-yard breakaway in the third quarter that gave Georgia (8-1, 6-1, No. 6 College Football Playoff) a 28-3 lead. He also had a nifty 20-yard scoring run in the second period when the game was close.\n\nHolyfield ran for a career-high 115 yards on 18 carries, scoring on a 4-yarder in the third quarter. Georgia rushed for a season-high 331 yards to earn a spot in the SEC championship game Dec. 1 in Atlanta.\n\n\"It's definitely a point proven,\" Holyfield said. \"There was a lot of talk about them.... and not enough talk about us.\"\n\nKentucky (7-2, 5-2, No. 9 CFP) has never reached the SEC championship game, which has been played every year since 1992. The Wildcats entered the weekend with the nation's top scoring defense and hadn't allowed anyone to exceed 20 points all year, but they couldn't slow down Georgia's tandem of Swift and Holyfield.\n\nBefore Saturday's game, the only player to rush for as many as 75 yards against Kentucky was Texas A&M's Trayveon Williams, who ran for 138 yards in a 20-14 overtime victory over the Wildcats. Swift and Holyfield were both over the 100-yard mark by the end of the third quarter.\n\n\"They did a good job,\" Kentucky coach Mark Stoops said. \"They moved us. They made us miss. There's a lot of things we could have done better, but a lot of that has to do with them.\"\n\nKentucky dominated time of possession through the first 1 1/2 quarters, but still trailed 7-3. That's when Swift started to give the Bulldogs some breathing room.\n\nWith Georgia facing second-and-17, Swift made a move around a defender at the line of scrimmage, made another move between two Wildcats about five yards downfield and shed a tackle inside the 5 to complete a remarkable 20-yard touchdown run.\n\nSwift's touchdown gave Georgia a 14-3 late in the second quarter. Georgia fumbled away a scoring opportunity late in the first half but got the ball to open the second half and extended the lead to 21-3 on Holyfield's touchdown.\n\nOn Georgia's next series, Swift raced through a big hole on the left side of the line and didn't appear to get touched on his 83-yard sprint to the end zone. Before that play, Kentucky hadn't allowed a run from scrimmage longer than 34 yards all season.\n\nThat touchdown sealed a hard-earned division title for Georgia, last year's College Football Playoff runner-up. After losing 36-16 at LSU two weeks ago, Georgia beat Florida and Kentucky for two straight wins over ranked division foes.\n\n\"Give our kids a lot of credit because their backs were against the wall kind of two weeks in a row and they came out fighting,\" Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. \"They came out scratching and clawing.\"\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nGeorgia: The Bulldogs' fearsome rushing attack was the difference in the game, but Georgia's pass rush also started showing signs of life. Georgia had four sacks Saturday after entering the weekend with an SEC-low 10 sacks all season. Georgia now won't have to play another true road game all season. The Bulldogs have home games with Auburn, Massachusetts and Georgia Tech the next three weeks.\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats reached Georgia territory on three straight first-half possessions and only had three points to show for it. That proved critical when a defense that had carried Kentucky all season couldn't slow down Georgia's rushing attack. Kentucky got more bad news in the third quarter when safety Darius West drew a targeting penalty that will knock him out for the first half of its game next week at Tennessee.\n\nSLOWING SNELL\n\nSnell ran for 73 yards and one touchdown for the Wildcats to increase his season total to 1,008, becoming the first Kentucky player to rush for 1,000 yards in three seasons. But he needed 20 carries to reach that total, an average of 3.65 yards per attempt.\n\n\"People doubt us and say we can't do this and we can't do that,\" Georgia defensive end Jonathan Ledbetter said. \"We'll just do what we do. When they realize that's what we do, we'll just keep pushing.\"\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nGeorgia may need some help to get up to the top five, though this victory likely assures the Bulldogs remain in control of their postseason fate. Kentucky figures to drop a few spots in the Top 25 and likely will leave the top 10 in the CFP rankings.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGeorgia hosts Auburn.\n\nKentucky visits Tennessee.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This week, they\u2019ll get their toughest test of the season when they travel to New Orleans to take on the Saints. The Saints only have one loss, and have playmakers on both offense and defense. Here\u2019s what the Rams can expect on both sides of the ball:\n\nOffense\n\nThe only offense in the NFC that can challenge the Rams for best in the conference is the Saints. Like the Rams, the Saints have a very solid offensive line, an elite running back who can be used in the passing game, and very talented wide receivers. Also like the Rams, the one weak spot of this New Orleans offense is at tight end, where 37-year-old Benjamin Watson is the top option.\n\nThe Saints have a two-headed monster in the backfield with Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara. Ingram is more of the between the tackles pure runner while they like to get Kamara in space on the outside and isolated on linebackers in the passing game. Kamara is a game-breaker capable of shredding a defense in a manner similar to Todd Gurley, and will present a tough test for the Rams\u2019 linebackers.\n\nMichael Thomas is one of the best receivers in the league, and the Rams\u2019 secondary will have a tough time slowing him down. They also have an emerging deep threat in rookie Tre\u2019Quan Smith, who has stepped up nicely since Ted Ginn went down. The Saints have surely been paying attention to Marcus Peters\u2019 tendency to get burned in recent weeks, so it would be surprising if they don\u2019t attempt a few balls down the field to Smith.\n\nThe key to slowing down the Saints offense will be getting pressure on Brees, particularly up the middle. As a smaller quarterback, Brees often struggles throwing over pressure that comes right up the gut. This is a game where Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh could have a massive impact and potentially win the game for the Rams.\n\nDefense\n\nIt\u2019s been an up and down season for the Saints\u2019 defense. At times they\u2019ve looked like the very solid unit they developed into last season, and at times they\u2019ve looked like the absolute sieve they were in 2016 and earlier.\n\nThe secondary has been terrible overall, but has shown signs of improvement in recent weeks. The Saints have a history of slow starts, so it\u2019s possible the defense is really trending upward at the right moment. The numbers thus far though, aren\u2019t pretty. They\u2019re 28th in the NFL in passing yards per game, and give up 8.7 yards per pass attempt.\n\nOn the other hand, they\u2019ve been the best run-defense team in the entire league. They\u2019ve only given up 74.1 rushing yards per game, by far the lowest of any team, and only give up 3.2 yards per carry. They have an extremely talented defensive front led by Cameron Jordan, Alex Okafor, and Sheldon Rankins. Talented rookie pass-rusher Marcus Davenport will miss the game with a toe injury, but that shouldn\u2019t impact things too much.\n\nIt\u2019s highly possible the Saints could shut down the Rams\u2019 ground game, and force them to be one dimensional. That should be fine, as long as the Rams can keep Jared Goff upright. The only times the Rams\u2019 offense has struggled this year are when Goff is under pressure, and the offensive line can\u2019t afford to crack at all.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nThis is the most talented team the Rams have faced this year. The crucial matchup on both sides of the ball is in the trenches, and the offensive and defensive line play of both teams will certainly determine the winner. If Goff has time to throw, he should be able to carve up the New Orleans secondary, but that\u2019s not a given. If Donald and Suh can get some pressure up the middle, they should be able to slow down the Saints\u2019 dynamic offense.", "BOILING SPRINGS, N.C.

(AP Photo/Jeffrey T. Barnes) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 An emotional tribute to Jason Pominville inspired the Buffalo Sabres to their biggest home win in a decade.\n\nAfter being honored on the ice in a pregame ceremony for playing his 1,000 NHL game earlier this week, Pominville had two goals and an assist to lead the Sabres in a 9-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday.\n\n\"I feel very fortunate to call this home and have the support of the fans that I have,\" said Pominville, who has played 674 of his 1,001 career games during two stints with the Sabres. \"From top to bottom, it was a great day.\"\n\nSabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula presented Pominville with a silver saber before the game and fans were given commemorative placards that read \"Welcome to Pominville, Population: 1000.\" Video tributes from current and former teammates, as well as Pominville's wife and two young children, were played throughout the game.\n\n\"Kind of fortunate we had a lead and I was able to look up and hear most of them,\" Pominville said. \"Just a lot of people that meant a lot to me throughout my career and a lot of great players and a lot of great memories with all of them. Yeah, it was pretty emotional at times.\"\n\nJeff Skinner also had two goals and and assist for the Sabres, who carried over the momentum from a two-goal third period in Thursday night's 4-2 loss at Ottawa to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\nConor Sheary, Casey Mittlestadt, Patrik Berglund and Zemgus Girgensons added a goal and an assist apiece, Kyle Okposo also scored, Jack Eichel had three assists and Linus Ullmark made 27 saves.\n\nBuffalo scored nine goals in a game for the first time since a 10-2 win over at Edmonton on Jan. 27, 2009. The last time they scored nine goals at home was a 10-1 win over Atlanta on Jan. 18, 2008.\n\n\"Just the environment, with Pommer, the whole ceremony, I think it capped off a really good night, a special night for him and our team,\" said Eichel, the Sabres' captain.\n\nPominville extended his point streak to seven games, his longest since 2014, when he played for the Minnesota Wild.\n\nMax McCormick and Thomas Chabot scored for Ottawa and Mike McKenna stopped 25 shots after replacing Craig Anderson in goal late in the first period.\n\nThe Senators have lost five of their last six and have allowed 30 goals during that stretch.\n\n\"I think collectively, we weren't ready for the emotional level that they had,\" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. \"They came out as strong as we've seen all year and most probably because the players wanted to have a great night for Pominville.\"\n\nThe Sabres took a 2-0 lead in the first 6:28 of a three-goal third period.\n\nOkposo opened the scoring a little over five minutes in on rising slap shot from outside the right circle.\n\nSkinner knocked in the rebound off Eichel's shot from the point less than two minutes later.\n\nPominville made it 3-0 when he batted a bouncing puck after Skinner's shot, chasing Anderson with 5:35 left in the first period.\n\nBuffalo scored four more goals in the first eight minutes of the second period.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Even if he isn't recognized as this year's top thoroughbred, Accelerate all but assured his place as North America's best older horse.\n\nHis signature win in the Breeders' Cup Classic should solidify his credentials for multiple honors.\n\nAccelerate took the lead at the top of the stretch and held off Gunnevera to win the $6 million Classic by a length Saturday, strengthening his bid for Horse of the Year over Triple Crown winner Justify.\n\nThe race lacked the retired 3-year-old star and left a wide-open field, which the 5-year-old chestnut horse eventually overtook after breaking from the No. 14 post as the favorite. Accelerate made a sweeping move in the far turn and was in charge at the top of the stretch, then held off Gunnevera for his fifth consecutive Grade 1 victory and sixth of seven overall this year.\n\nThat gave trainer John Sadler his first Breeders' Cup win since his initial starter 30 years ago.\n\nAs for the California-based Accelerate being named this year's top thoroughbred, Sadler said he'd leave that up to media who vote on the Eclipse Awards. He noted his own bias, though.\n\n\"To me, he's the Horse of the Year, no doubt,\" Sadler said. \"He's won all those great races. To win the Santa Anita Handicap (in March) was for me probably one or two on my bucket list.\n\n\"The Classic is a newer race but a great race, and he won that so smashingly. He's just a great horse and had a great year.\"\n\nRidden by Joel Rosario, Accelerate covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:02.93 and paid $7.40, $6 and $4.40.\n\n\"He broke really well,\" Rosario said of Accelerate. \"I was on the outside and had to use him a little bit. I just wanted to get a position because I was way out there. I know I had a long run to the turn but I wanted to be not too wide.\n\n\"When I got to the backside I tried to be in the clear, which is what he likes to do.\"\n\nThe Classic triumph capped a successful Breeders' Cup for the jockey, who also rode Game Winner and Jaywalk to victories on Friday in the Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies Turf, respectively.\n\nGunnevera returned $21.80 and $11.80, while Thunder Snow paid $8 in redeeming himself at Churchill Downs after a last-place finish in the 2017 Kentucky Derby.\n\nOff the board were Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert's duo of West Coast and McKinzie. They finished seventh and 12th, respectively, after projections of challenging Accelerate in the marquee event of nine season-ending championship races.\n\n\"They looked good for a mile,\" Baffert said. \"They just tired and just didn't have it today.\"\n\nGunnevera, Thunder Snow and early pace setter Mendelssohn made things interesting before 70,423, an upside to the absence of horse racing's 13th Triple Crown winner from the Classic. Justify's ankle issue led Baffert to retire the colt in July, eliminating the opportunity to follow 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah in pursuit of a rare grand slam.\n\nAccelerate claimed his fourth race in a row and answered the question of if he could continue his roll after beating West Coast by 2 1/4 lengths in the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita. And it followed other notable performances on the second day of the $30 million championships.\n\nMonomoy Girl bolstered her case as the top 3-year-old filly by winning the $2 million Distaff. The anticipated duel between the reigning Kentucky Oaks winner and her 2017 predecessor Abel Tasman never materialized, as Monomoy Girl made her move at the final turn and held off Wow Cat by a length for her sixth victory this season.\n\n\"She was training like a monster and ran like a monster,\" said Louisville-based trainer Brad Cox, who earned his first Cup victory. Jockey Florent Geroux collected his fifth win.\n\nPeter Miller made Breeders' Cup history as the first trainer to saddle two repeat winners in the same Breeders' Cup races. Soon after Stormy Liberal out-dueled favorite World of Trouble to retake the $1 million Turf Sprint by a neck, 6-year-old Roy H swept past Promises Fulfilled and flew to a 3 1/4-length win in the $2 million Sprint. Jockey Paco Lopez earned his first Breeders' Cup victory.\n\nEnable followed up last month's Arc de Triomphe victory by winning the $4 million Turf by 3/4 lengths over Magical. The 4-year-old British filly became the first horse to win both prestigious races in the same year. She earned her 10th win from 11 career starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Athletic first reported the decision. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Oakland Raiders waived Bruce Irvin on Saturday after the team's leading pass rusher had his playing time reduced significantly in recent weeks.\n\nIrvin played just nine snaps in a 34-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday night. He will be subject to waivers and will be owed about $3.8 million for the rest of the season if he isn't claimed next week.\n\n\"We would like to thank Bruce Irvin for his years of service to the Oakland Raiders and we wish him the best,\" general manager Reggie McKenzie said.\n\nOakland came into the year banking on Irvin and Khalil Mack to serve as bookend pass rushers anchoring the defense. Mack was traded a week before the season to Chicago for a package of draft picks following a lengthy contract holdout, and now Irvin is gone too.\n\nIrvin thanked the Raiders organization for his time in Oakland.\n\n\"I will always cherish my experience with the Oakland Raiders,\" he said on his Twitter feed. \"As the seasons change, so do our roles and I look forward to continuing my journey with the NFL!\"\n\nThe Raiders (1-7) rank last in the NFL with just seven sacks and have a league-worst 35 quarterback pressures, according to SportRadar. The next worst team is Tennessee with 59.\n\nThe 31-year-old Irvin has three of the sacks and five of the pressures but has had little impact on a defense that is on pace to be one of the worst ever. Irvin has just six tackles despite an $8 million salary.\n\nOakland is allowing 6.76 yards per play, the worst by any team through eight games since the 1970 merger. The Raiders have allowed the second-most points as a franchise through eight games (252), are tied for the second-fewest takeaways (six) and have the fewest sacks (seven). Oakland also has allowed opponents to have a 113.9 passer rating, a mark that only one team ever has been worse than over a full season.\n\nIrvin played just 24 snaps in Week 8 against Indianapolis and then just nine against the 49ers. Irvin's six games with his fewest snap counts since joining the Raiders in 2016 have come this year. Irvin had one tackle, no sacks and no pressures his final three games.\n\nCoach Jon Gruden attributed the lack of playing time to Irvin not being part of the base defense against the 49ers.\n\n\"We weren't in our nickel defense very much,\" Gruden said Friday. \"Remember we're a 4-3 team, we're not a 3-4. So in the base defense, sometimes he doesn't fit the role that we need done. No disrespect to Bruce. He's an edge rusher. We haven't had a lead. We haven't had the opposition behind in the chains a lot. So his role has been reduced. I know he's frustrated. I'm frustrated. We'll try to solve that as soon as possible. He's a good player. He's a good player.\"\n\nIrvin was on the field for just seven of the team's 23 snaps in nickel formation with his other two plays coming in goal-line defense.\n\nIrvin had 15 sacks his first two seasons with the Raiders. Irvin's 11 forced fumbles since the start of the 2016 season are the most in the NFL in that span.\n\nThe Raiders have now cut two of the players picked as captain this season having already released linebacker Derrick Johnson last month.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

None of those developments proved consequential. He was 25-of-42 passing for 295 yards and moved as well as well as he needed to, particularly when he sprinted up the middle of the field or his long TD run in the third quarter to give Alabama (9-0, 6-0 SEC, No. 1 CFP) a 22-0 lead.\n\nTagovailoa limped off the field after that play, went into the medical tent for some treatment and rode a stationary bike on the sideline, but returned for the next series.\n\nLSU (7-2, 4-2, No. 3 CFP) entered a chance to control of the SEC Western Division with a victory, but that began to decreasingly realistic with every possession.\n\nAlabama led 16-0 by halftime and forced LSU punts on the Tigers' first nine possessions. LSU drove to the Alabama 15 on its 10th series early in the fourth quarter, only to miss a field goal with 10:45 to go.\n\nTigers quarterback Joe Burrow completed 18 of 35 passes for 184 yards.

The Wildcats (5-4) had won four in a row to grab the Big Ten West lead and they stayed in this one when it looked like Notre Dame was ready to pull away.\n\nBook threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to a leaping Miles Boykin in the corner of the end zone and a 47-yarder to Michael Young in the third to give the Irish a 21-7 lead.

Texas Tech officials didn't immediately say why Bowman left the game.\n\nTexas Tech punted three straight times without getting a first down after Jett Duffey replaced Bowman again, just as he did five weeks ago when Bowman sustained a partially collapsed lung against West Virginia. Bowman returned two weeks ago against Kansas.\n\nDuffey then started moving the Red Raiders, and they pulled within two on his 4-yard scoring pass to Zach Austin on fourth down midway through the fourth quarter.

The Cougars have a 12-game home winning streak, fourth-longest in the nation.\n\nChase Garbers threw for 127 yards and ran for 67 for Cal (5-4, 2-4).\n\nThis is Washington State's first 8-1 start since 2002.\n\nNO. 12 WEST VIRGINIA 42, NO. 15 TEXAS 41\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Will Grier threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Gary Jennings with 16 seconds left, and then ran in the 2-point conversion to lift West Virginia past Texas.\n\nGrier broke his finger on a run to the pylon in the first quarter of a loss to Texas last year, and his winning run came on a similar scramble. But there was no defender near him this time as he held the ball up while crossing the goal line untouched.\n\nThe 2-point conversion came moments after Grier connected with David Sills. Texas had called timeout just before the ball was snapped so the Mountaineers had to line up again. Grier dropped back, took a step into the pocket, and then swung out to his left to break for the corner of the end zone.\n\nGrier drove the Mountaineers (7-1, 5-1 Big 12, No. 13 CFP) to the win after Texas grabbed a 41-34 lead on Sam Ehlinger's touchdown throw to Devin Duvernay with 2:34 to play.\n\nGrier finished with 346 yards passing and three touchdowns, two to Sills.\n\nEhlinger passed for 356 yards and three scores and also ran for a touchdown for Texas (6-3, 4-2, No. 17 CFP), which has lost two in a row.\n\nMISSOURI 38, NO. 13 FLORIDA 17\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Drew Lock picked apart Florida's defense for the second straight year, throwing three touchdown passes to lead Missouri.\n\nLock completed 24 of 32 passes for 250 yards, with scoring throws to Albert Okwuegbunam, Kam Scott and Emanuel Hall that stunned the Swamp. Fortunately for the Gators (6-3, 4-3 Southeastern Conference), they won't have to face the senior and possible first-round draft pick again.\n\nThey might have seen the last of Feleipe Franks, too.\n\nCoach Dan Mullen benched Franks late in the third quarter \u2014 the home crowd cheered wildly \u2014 and backup Kyle Trask promptly directed a 75-yard touchdown drive in which he converted two fourth downs. Trask found Josh Hammond in the end zone on the second one for a 7-yard score that made it 35-17.\n\nThe Tigers (5-4, 1-4) responded with a field goal that essentially sealed their first SEC win of the season and sent fans scrambling for the exits.\n\nARIZONA STATE 38, NO. 16 UTAH 20\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Manny Wilkins threw three touchdown passes to N'Keal Harry and Arizona State beat Utah, knocking the No. 16 Utes out of sole possession of first place in Pac-12 South.\n\nThe Utes (6-3, 4-3 Pac-12) lost quarterback Tyler Huntley to a broken collarbone in the third quarter. The loss snapped Utah's four-game winning streak.\n\nHuntley was injured when he was hit while forcing a throw with 5:33 left in the third quarter. Freshman Jason Shelly replaced him and the offense struggled after that.\n\nHarry caught nine passes for 161 yards, including TD catches of three, 23 and 61 yards. His three TD catches were a career high. Wilkins completed 19 of 24 for 285 yards and three scores with one interception. Eno Benjamin rushed for 175 yards, including a 44-yard TD run that sealed the victory with 4:12 to play. Arizona State (5-4, 3-3) gained 536 yards against a Utah defense that had been ranked No. 1 in the Pac-12.\n\nSMU 45, NO. 17 HOUSTON 31\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 Ben Hicks threw for 318 yards and four touchdowns and SMU beat Houston, the second time in three years the Mustangs upset a ranked Cougars team.\n\nThe Mustangs (4-5, 3-2 American) never trailed, jumping out to a 17-0 lead after Hicks threw his second TD, a 17-yarder to Tyler Page less than a minute into the second quarter. Houston played its first game as a ranked team under second-year coach Major Applewhite.\n\nHicks threw three touchdowns as a redshirt freshman in the shocker two years ago, when SMU beat the then-No. 11 Cougars 38-16 and knocked them all of the way out of the poll.\n\nAfter Houston (7-2, 4-1, No. 17 CFP) got to 38-31 on quarterback D'Eriq King's 3-yard touchdown run with 9:34 left, the Mustangs went on a time-consuming 13-play drive that ended with Ke'Mon Freeman's second touchdown run, an 8-yarder with 2:43 left. That drive was interrupted for about 90 minutes because of lightning and heavy rain. Freeman ran 20 times for 107 yards.\n\nNO. 18 UTAH STATE 56, HAWAII 17\n\nHONOLULU (AP) \u2014 Darwin Thompson and Gerold Bright each ran for three touchdowns as Utah State extended its winning streak to eight games.\n\nThe Aggies (8-1, 5-0 Mountain West) amassed 601 yards of total offense, including 426 rushing, and had a pair of 28-point quarters to pull away from the Rainbow Warriors (6-5, 3-3).\n\nThompson rushed 13 times for a career-best 141 yards and scored on a pair of 1-yard runs, as well as a 26-yard sprint. Bright carried a career-high 16 times for 121 yards and found the end zone on runs of 18, 47 and 9 yards.\n\nJordan Love threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Ron'quavion Tarver and ran in a 1-yard score on the final play of the first quarter.\n\nCole McDonald threw a pair of touchdown passes for Hawaii, which finished with 390 yards of total offense.\n\nPURDUE 38, NO. 19 IOWA 36\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Spencer Evans made a 25-yard field goal with 8 seconds left, lifting Purdue past Iowa and back in the Big Ten's West Division title hunt.\n\nDavid Blough threw three touchdown passes to Terry Wright and topped the 300-yard mark for the fifth time this season. The Boilermakers (5-4, 4-2 Big Ten) have won five of their last six and beat their third ranked team this season \u2014 the first time they've achieved that feat since 2003 \u2014 to move within one game of division leader Northwestern.\n\nThe Hawkeyes (6-3, 3-3) lost their second straight road game despite Nate Stanley's big day. The junior quarterback threw for 275 yards with one TD and ran for another but the conference's No. 2 scoring defense allowed a season-high point total.And when the Hawkeyes needed one last stop, Blough drove Purdue 43 yards to set up Evans for the winning kick.\n\nNO. 20 FRESNO STATE 48, UNLV 3\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Marcus McMaryion threw for two touchdowns and 274 yards and Fresno State's defense had a near-perfect game.\n\nFresno State (8-1, 5-0 Mountain West) won its seventh straight and ended its two-game losing streak to the Rebels. The Bulldogs kept their one-game lead in the West Division over San Diego State, which won at New Mexico 31-23 Saturday night.\n\nMcMaryion completed 26 of 35 passes and rushed for 39 yards as his defense held UNLV to 175 total yards of offense through three quarters.\n\nKeeSean Johnson had eight receptions for 97 yards to move his streak to 45 consecutive games with a catch. Coming into Saturday, Johnson led the nation in active career receptions at 234.\n\nFresno State's defense only allowed the Rebels over midfield twice in the first three quarters.\n\nCharles Williams, a Fresno native, was the lone bright spot for UNLV (2-7, 0-5) as he rushed for 121 yards on 16 carries. UNLV's Max Gilliam was 14 of 30 for 98 yards for the Rebels, who will not be bowl eligible due to the loss.\n\nNO. 22 SYRACUSE 41, WAKE FOREST 24\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

Fitzgerald completed 17 of 28 passes and threw his touchdowns to Stephen Guidry, Deddrick Thomas, Kylin Hill and Jesse Jackson.\n\nFitzgerald also ran for 107 yards.

(AP Photo/Larry Papke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Martin Truex Jr. has promised that Joey Logano won't win the NASCAR Cup title.\n\nThat is a score that can't be settled at Texas.\n\nFor now, defending Cup champion Truex is trying to stay focused on winning at Texas, or next week in Phoenix, or at least getting enough points to make sure that he is one of the four drivers racing for the title in two weeks.\n\n\"That's the plan anyways,\" Truex said. \"I do pretty good about keeping my head straight. I've said my peace, told him what I thought and I'm here at Texas trying to win.\"\n\nLogano is the only driver locked into the final four spots, clinching that after his bump-and-run on the final lap to beat Truex last week at Martinsville.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of that race, Truex proclaimed, \"He may have won the battle, but he ain't winning the damn war.\" A text to Logano followed that night.\n\nTruex qualified 13th for Sunday's race at Texas, but will start at the back of the field after making an engine change.\n\nThe only of the eight championship contenders to qualified lower than Truex was Chase Elliott at 16th.\n\n\"We have two important races here where I am in a position to run for a championship,\" Truex said. \"I am not going to let what happened last week take my focus off of that.\"\n\nThe four Stewart-Haas drivers were the top four qualifiers among the eight contenders, with Clint Bowyer on the front row after qualifying second, with teammates Kevin Harvick and Aric Almirola in the second row and Kurt Busch starting seventh. Logano qualified eighth, and Kyle Busch 10th.\n\nWhen asked at Texas if everything was cool with Truex, or if his head would be on a swivel looking around, Logano said only time would tell.\n\n\"I think he was a little frustrated and that is part of it. I also think it is short track racing,\" Logano said. \"All of that was on the line at that point and I think we both understand that there was so much on the line and that is what happens sometimes.\"\n\nThe playoff chase has gone from the half-mile paperclip-shaped track at Martinsville to the high-speed 1 1/2-mile Texas layout where polesitter Ryan Blaney qualified at more than 200 mph, along with Bowyer.\n\nAfter Logano knocked him out of his first victory at a short track, Truex will try to get his first win at Texas, where he has 14 top-10 finishes and has led 595 laps \u2014 but never the last one.\n\n\"We just haven't been very lucky here. We've performed well and haven't had much luck,\" Truex said. \"Hopefully this weekend it turns around.\"\n\nHe had six consecutive top 10s at Texas, including a runner-up finish last fall, until last April. The first 85-lap stage earlier this year ended under caution after a front right tire blew on Truex's No. 78 Toyota, which shot up the track and slammed hard into the outer wall. Truex, second at the time, finished last in the 37-car field.\n\nTruex is tied with Harvick for third in the playoff standings, 25 points above the cutline with three spots still up for grabs.\n\nWhile trying to get one of those spots, Truex is going into the final three races with the Furniture Row team since the primary sponsor is leaving the one-car operation based in suburban Denver.\n\n\"Honestly I feel like we've been so caught up in everything, and just so focused on trying to get back to Homestead and trying to repeat, we haven't really talked about it,\" Truex said. \"It's inevitable, and it's not a perfect scenario, it's not what we all wanted, but I think everybody on the team has done an amazing job of focusing in on the right things and continue to perform at a high level.\"\n\nAnd contending for another championship.\n\nTruex has 19 top-10 finishes this season \u2014 all of those are top-fives.\n\n\"We have zero finishes from sixth to 10th,\" Truex said. \"That's kind of been our year. It's been either, we're in position to win, we've run up front all day, or something really stupid happens, or crazy happens, like here in Texas. ... It's like feast or famine.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wyoming's 424 yards rushing was the team's highest since a 430-yard attack Sept. 12, 2015, against Eastern Michigan. Chambers' long jaunt put Wyoming (4-6, 2-4 Mountain West) up 17-3 midway through the third quarter.\n\nThe Cowboys' Antonio Hull broke up a fourth-down pass at the Wyoming 14 with 11:59 remaining to preserve the lead, but Jonathan Lenard Jr. forced Evans to fumble on the Cowboys' next series, and Jesse Osuna recovered for the Spartans. Six plays later, Josh Love threw a 17-yard strike to Tre Walker in the right front corner of the end zone, but San Jose State muffed the extra point, leaving the score 17-9 with 8:48 to play.\n\nWyoming then marched 75 yards, keeping the ball on the ground for 13 plays until Chambers connected with Austin Fort on a 20-yard TD pass with 1:09 left. Chambers converted a pair of third downs during the drive.\n\n\"Certainly with the conditions, the wind and snow, it turned it into a game that we needed to leverage our running ability,\" said Wyoming coach Craig Bohl, whose team rushed 64 times and passed only eight. \"It ate up time off the clock, kept our defense fresh and had a big impact on the game.\"\n\nEvans, who had his third-best rushing day, moved from 13th to sixth on Wyoming's single-season rushing list and with two games to go, the senior has 1,166 yards. He needs 135 to catch No. 5 Devin Moore, who had 1,301 yards in 2008.\n\nWyoming guard Kayden Jackson said Chambers \"runs the ball hard (and is) not afraid to lower his shoulder, and if you have a quarterback that can do that, you better look out.\"\n\nBlocking for Evans, Jackson said, is \"awesome.\"\n\n\"Nico runs hard, finds seams in the gaps and if we don't quite get the movement, he makes plays.\"\n\nWyoming's two long runs were the exception to a great battle on the line of scrimmage, according to Spartans nose tackle Boogie Roberts, who had eight tackles and a forced fumble.\n\n\"Man, we were fighting. It was a battle down in the trenches,\" he said. \"They were giving some, we were giving some. And then two small plays, long runs. ... Just a shout-out to their O-line, and their running backs were running hard.\"\n\nSan Jose State coach Brent Brennan said Evans is \"a stud, an absolute stud,\" adding that his team's defense had two key breakdowns.\n\n\"We were playing good defense, the one Chambers split in the second half ... seemed like he was running forever,\" Brennan said. \"And then the one by Evans in the first half was also a big play.

San Jose State had only 39 yards and two first downs in the first half and didn't cross midfield until the third quarter. The Spartans finished with 244 yards.\n\nWyoming: The Cowboys remained in the hunt for bowl eligibility with their second straight conference win. With Chambers at the helm, the offense continues to improve, piling up a season-high 475 yards and finishing with a time-consuming drive to seal the win. The defense, led by Logan Wilson's 10 tackles, made key stops down the stretch and held the Spartans to their third-lowest yardage total of the year.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSan Jose State: The Spartans visit Utah State next Saturday. The Aggies have won seven straight in the series, including a 61-10 beat down last year.\n\nWyoming: The Cowboys will take their second bye week before hosting Air Force on Nov. 17.

(AP) \u2014 Jake Bentley passed for two touchdowns and scored the\n\ngame-winning touchdown on a 4-yard run with 5:50 left to lift South\n\nCarolina to a 48-44 comeback win over Mississippi on Saturday.\n\nSouth Carolina (5-3, 4-3) erased a 44-34 deficit in the fourth quarter to\n\nwin consecutive games for the first time this season. The Gamecocks\n\ncovered 47 and 73 yards in fourth-quarter scoring drives, capped by a\n\n3-yard run from A. J. Turner and Bentley's decisive score, respectively.\n\nBentley finished 22-of-32 passing for 363 yards as the Gamecocks had 510\n\ntotal yards. The South Carolina defense, after giving up eight scores in\n\n10 possessions, closed with four consecutive scoreless series to preserve\n\nthe win.\n\n\"Jake gave a gutsy performance and was really accurate with the ball,\"\n\nSouth Carolina coach Will Muschamp said. \"The resiliency and fight of\n\nthis football team says a lot about the culture of our program. A lot of\n\nguys stepped up to win this game.\"\n\nOle Miss (5-4, 1-4) rallied from an early 17-3 deficit for a 27-27 tie at\n\nhalftime and moved out to a 44-34 fourth-quarter lead. Jordan Ta'amu was\n\n31-of-46 passing for 379 yards as the Rebels had 616 yards of total\n\noffense, including 141 rushing yards on 21 carries from Scottie Phillips.\n\n\"We just did not make the plays we needed to make,\" Mississippi coach\n\nMatt Luke said. \"They did and we didn't, especially in those final\n\nseries. This is tough because our players left it all on the field.\"\n\nThe first-half shootout opened on a 90-yard kickoff return touchdown by\n\nDeebo Samuel as the Gamecocks raced to an early 14-point lead. By\n\nhalftime, Parker White had field goals of 20 and 23 yards, Ty'Son Williams\n\nscored on a 2-yard run and Bryan Edwards pulled in a 75-yard touchdown\n\npass from Bentley.\n\nOle Miss countered with a 24-point outburst in the second period,\n\nhighlighted by touchdown runs of 1 and 9 yards by Phillips.

Josh Vann had a 5-yard\n\nscoring pass from Bentley late in the third quarter before South\n\nCarolina rallied in the final 12 minutes.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks got a little breathing room in\n\nbecoming bowl eligible as home games remain with subdivision\n\nChattanooga and non-Power Five member Akron. The clutch defensive\n\nfinish, which included sacks by Jordan Kinlaw and T.J. Brunson,\n\nwas encouraging since ranked opponents No. 11 Florida and No. 2\n\nClemson remain on the schedule.\n\nOle Miss: Ta'amu took a physical beating as the game progressed\n\nand it showed in the fourth quarter as he completed only three\n\npasses for 10 yards. When the Rebels are held in check offensively\n\nor at least slowed down, the defense simply can't compensate\n\nenough for a win. As usual, the receivers were impressive as\n\nElijah Moore had 129 yards on 11 receptions and A.J. Brown had 115\n\nyards on six catches.\n\nGAME CHANGER\n\nSouth Carolina finished with 147 yards rushing, but the game's decisive\n\neffort was a 69-yard run by Mon Denson to the Ole Miss 4-yard line while\n\ntrailing 44-41 with seven minutes remaining.

He expected the decision to clock the ball, but then got the signal for the last play that resulted in the game-winning score.\n\n\"We were so close that we still would have had time to kick a field goal,\" Brewer said. \"As a quarterback you have to be ready for anything.\"\n\nThe win gets Baylor (5-4, 3-3 Big 12) within one win of bowl eligibility, a year after winning only one game in Rhule's first season.\n\nOn Brewer's first drive, the Bears went 86 yards \u2014 aided by 30 yards of penalties against the Cowboys \u2014 and scored on a 36-yard TD pass to Jalen Hurd with 5:43 left.\n\nBaylor's game-winning drive started after Oklahoma State (5-4, 2-4) was stopped on fourth down, when Chris Miller sacked Taylor Cornelius for a 9-yard loss with 1:31 left.\n\n\"You're in fourth-and-3.

That leaves them one win shy of being bowl eligible for the 13th straight season, with road games against No. 7 Oklahoma and TCU, and a home tilt with No. 12 West Virginia left on the schedule. In addition to the blocked punt, Matt Ammendola had a 47-yard field goal blocked and was well short kicking a 45-yarder into a stiff breeze.\n\nBaylor: The Bears were winless at home last season but are 4-1 with only a reeling TCU team still set to come to McLane Stadium.

His 8-yarder to Greg Dortch pulled them to 35-24 with 3:38 left in the third quarter.\n\nBut after Wake Forest forced a stop, Hartman fumbled at his own 34 and Syracuse turned that takeaway into Szmyt's 28-yard field goal that put Orange up by 14 with 11:55 left.\n\nCade Carney had a 2-yard touchdown run and Nick Sciba kicked a 22-yard field goal to give Wake Forest an early 10-0 lead.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSyracuse: Dungey and one of the ACC's highest-scoring offenses always get the attention, but the Orange defense stepped up in this one. Syracuse, which entered 11th in the ACC in total defense and allows 432 total yards per game, held one of the league's most productive offenses in check, forcing three turnovers that led to 10 points and matching a season best with six sacks.\n\nWake Forest: The Demon Deacons have yet to show they can beat a good team. The three FBS teams they've defeated \u2014 Tulane, Rice and Louisville \u2014 entered the weekend with a combined record of 6-19. They fell to 0-3 against Top 25 opponents, losing all three at home by at least 17 points apiece.\n\n\"We play well early, and once the snap count gets up there and we get worn down and we've got to put subs in, we get crushed,\" coach Dave Clawson said. \"We have no depth.\"\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nA double-digit road win in conference play will do nothing to hurt the Orange's first national ranking in 17 years. Another tumultuous weekend at the bottom of the polls could push them into the top 20.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nThis was the second-best rushing day of Dungey's career, surpassed only by his 200-yard performance in the opener at Western Michigan. It also was his sixth game with at least 100 yards rushing. ... Syracuse's 266 yards rushing was its third-highest total of the season, and its most against a power-conference opponent. Neal (67) and Dontae Strickland (64) each had more than 60 yards on the ground.\n\nORANGE SLICES\n\nThis was the Orange's first November victory under Babers, with Dungey saying it's \"hopefully the first of four.\" They entered 0-8 in November games under Babers and had been outscored 399-186 in those games. Dungey missed six of them with injuries. ... Syracuse has four ACC wins for the first time since its first year in the conference (2013).\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\"Just to chill. 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Chill, Honey Bunny? Just chill.' \" \u2014 Babers, on the early 10-0 deficit.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSyracuse: hosts Louisville on Friday night.\n\nWake Forest: faces an even quicker turnaround with a Thursday night game at North Carolina State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jay LaPrete) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 With five minutes left in the game and Ohio State clinging to a six-point lead, J.K. Dobbins burst through a hole between center and right guard and rumbled untouched 42 yards for a touchdown and some breathing room.\n\nThe breakaway by the Buckeyes' tailback was hugely satisfying for coach Urban Meyer, considering the running game has been absent for the past month, most notably in the inexplicable upset loss to Purdue two weeks ago. He harped on it with his team in the days afterward.\n\nDobbins ran for a season-high 163 yards and two more touchdowns as No. 8 Ohio State rallied in the second half and then weathered a late Nebraska score to win 36-31 on Saturday.\n\n\"It was great to get back to our old ways,\" Dobbins said. \"We knew what we could do.\"\n\nIt wasn't only Ohio State's running game that showed up again. Its depleted and much-maligned defense \u2014 missing three starters in the secondary and prone to giving up big plays \u2014 staged a second-half stand.\n\nDown 21-16 at half after the Huskers (2-7, 1-5 Big Ten) turned two Ohio State fumbles into touchdown drives, the Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1, No. 10 CFP) rallied in the second half. They forced five straight punts and held Nebraska to a field-goal when a drive stalled at the 1.\n\n\"We had every chance to in the world to win that game,\" Nebraska coach Scott Frost said.\n\nAfter the field goal, Dobbins broke off his run to cap the next series. Nebraska's Adrian Martinez threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to JD Spielman to pull the Cornhuskers within five with 3 minutes left, but Dobbins pounded away for two first downs to run out the clock.\n\n\"The biggest thing is to get that darned bad taste out of your mouth from two weeks ago and win the game,\" Meyer said. \"It was a close game against a team that was hitting its stride now.\"\n\nHASKINS GRINDS IT OUT\n\nOhio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr. didn't have a great day, but he got the job done.\n\nAfter nearly flawless performances early in the season put him in the Heisman Trophy conversation, he was 18 for 32 for 252 yards Saturday with a pair of touchdowns, including a 42-yard scoring toss to J.K. Dobbins in the first quarter . But he also fumbled twice and threw an interception.\n\n\"We cost ourselves with a couple of fumbles and a couple of miscommunications,\" Haskins said.\n\nHis 18 completions gave him 242 for the year and broke the single-season school record of 240 set by J.T. Barrett last season.\n\nHUSKERS RISING\n\nFor a team that lost six a row for its worst start in the program's 129-year history, Nebraska's improvement is astonishing.\n\nMartinez is getting better every week and bested Haskins. He was 22 for 33 for 266 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 72 yards and two more scores.\n\nRunning back Devine Ozigbo ran for 86 yards and a score.\n\n\"A lot of things had to happen to get a team that would go toe-toe with a top-10 team,\" Frost said. \"Six weeks ago we went to Ann Arbor (Michigan) and played a team like that and we had no chance. We walked out of there with our tails between our legs.

And Embiid doesn't stop going at Drummond when the game is over.\n\nEmbiid scored 32 of his 39 points in a dominating first half and had 17 rebounds and then let Drummond know about it afterward, leading the 76ers to a 109-99 victory over the Pistons on Saturday.\n\nEmbiid made 10 of 18 field goals and 18 of 23 free throws to help Philadelphia improve to 6-0 at home.\n\nDrummond and Embiid have butted heads throughout their careers, with Embiid recently saying he \"owns real estate\" in Drummond's head after Detroit's big man was ejected in the Pistons' 133-132 overtime victory on Oct. 23.\n\n\"He's a fun matchup,\" Embiid said. \"I feel like I dominate every game, especially against him.\"\n\nPistons coach Dwane Casey and Drummond questioned the officiating.

That's the way they're calling the game right now. I have to figure a way to adjust. It's hard to play like that.\"\n\nEmbiid's first-half numbers were astounding.

And it's not the first time. USA TODAY\n\nMembers of the Central American migrant caravan move towards their destination of the United States border on Nov. 03, 2018 in Sayula de Aleman, Mexico. The group of migrants, many of them fleeing violence in their home countries, last took a rest day on Wednesday and has resumed their journey. As fatigue from the heat, distance and poor sanitary conditions has set in, the numbers of people participating in the trek has slowly dwindled but a significant group are still determined to get to the United States. President Donald Trump said Wednesday as many as 15,000 troops may be deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to prevent members of the migrant caravan from illegally entering the country.

The governor of Veracruz state had promised transportation to Mexico City \u2013 330 miles to the northeast \u2013 for the well-publicized caravan of migrants, who have walked and thumbed rides for three weeks since setting out from Honduras.\n\nThe buses never arrived.\n\nGov. Miguel \u00c1ngel Yunes Linares backtracked on his promise, saying in a statement that Mexico City wasn\u2019t ready to receive 160 busloads of migrants due to water shortages in the national capital, where the waterworks are being repaired and millions of residents lack service.\n\nBut Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a migrant advocacy organization assisting the caravan, said in a statement that the organization had already prepared for the water shortage and taken precautions to receive the migrants in Mexico City.\n\nStuck without bus rides to the national capital and still 750 miles from Brownsville, Texas, the closest U.S. port of entry, the caravan set out on Saturday for the town of Isla, some 45 miles up the road. Villanueva begged for coins as tractor trailers and buses slowed while passing through Sayula de Alem\u00e1n, hoping to pay for a bus ride.\n\nThe migrants are spread out in groups in the nearby towns of Juan Rodr\u00edguez Clara, Veracruz and Isla, Veracruz, which are about 40 miles from their previous rest stop in Sayula. Another contingent is trying to make additional headway by pushing to Tierra Blanca, Veracruz, which lies about 80 additional miles to the north, reports The Associated Press.\n\nYunes had offered to take the caravan to an undisclosed city in southern Veracruz state \u2013 a further distance from the U.S. border \u2013 but the migrants turned down the offer. In a 5 a.m. assembly, they voted to head for Isla instead.\n\nThe caravan has been winding its way through southern Mexico the past two weeks since fording the Suchiate River separating the country with Guatemala. It\u2019s pushed past police blockades, endured scorching heat and torrential rains, and survived on the generosity of ordinary Mexicans, who have offered everything from free rides to hot meals to places to sleep.\n\nThe Mexican government has tried to thin out the caravan by offering its participants temporary work visas and social benefits such as healthcare and education. As the caravan moved through southern Mexico, few of the participants appear anxious to take up the offer of residency.\n\nFew returning home\n\nAt a table set up by Mexico\u2019s National Immigration Institute in Sayula de Alem\u00e1n to assist migrants with voluntary repatriation to Central America, an official said only 14 people over the past two days had asked to return home. The official estimated size of the caravan stands at 4,000 people \u2013 though another two caravans were moving through the southern state of Chiapas on Saturday.\n\nThe governors\u2019 offer of transportation to Mexico City wasn\u2019t entirely altruistic and reflected the unfriendly attitudes of Mexican officials toward Central American migrants transiting illegally through Mexico \u2013 even as Mexico defends its own undocumented citizens living in the United States. Yunes told the newspaper El Universal, \u201cWe can\u2019t receive a large number of migrants. There are already migrants in Veracruz, begging for money in the streets. It\u2019s a serious social problem and we don\u2019t want it to increase.\u201d\n\nVillanueva, 34, joined the caravan from the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, \u2013 among the most violent places in the hemisphere \u2013 after seeing a news report on Honduran television. She has worked cleaning a pharmacy, but says she hasn\u2019t had a job in three years \u2013 something she blamed on age discrimination as employment ads in many Latin American countries often ask for young people with an education and a \u201cbuena presentaci\u00f3n\u201d (good appearance).\n\nTraveling in a caravan, she said, appealed to her as an opportunity to safely transit the length of Mexico, where the risks of the road include rape, kidnap and extortion. The caravan\u2019s route over the next few days traverses a treacherous area known as Tierra Blanca, where drug cartel activities are commonplace and crimes committed against migrants rife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the caravan so I don\u2019t get kidnapped, so immigration officers don\u2019t grab me and deport me, she said. \u201cI feel safety in numbers.\u201d\n\nOthers on the caravan told similar stories as they ambled toward Tierra Blanca under cloudy skies and light drizzle, along with lower temperatures in the high 70s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not worried if we travel together,\u201d said Carlos Funes, 62, a father of nine and a farmhand from northern Honduras, who left working on a palm oil plantation because he couldn\u2019t make ends meet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been poverty in Honduras, but not extreme poverty like now,\u201d he said, repeating a sentiment often heard among caravan travelers who say the rising cost of living and stagnant salaries are causing many Hondurans to migrate.\n\nSleeping through rain showers\n\nCaravan participants spent a second consecutive night of sleeping through rain showers, which left their scant possessions soaked. Parents pushed children in strollers along the highway, pleading for rides from passing motorists, as young men clung to slow-moving-semis \u2013 including a trailer hauling live chickens.\n\nFunes, with his weathered skin and wearing well-worn sandals and toting a backpack with a change of clothes, a plastic tarp, a blanket and a Bible, set out on foot.\n\n\u201cI prefer to suffer on the road than see my family suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to reach the U.S. border,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll enter.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has spoken out repeatedly against the caravan as a midterm elections campaign issue, has portrayed the caravan as an invasion and vowed to let migrants enter the United States. He has ordered 5,000 troops to the border \u2013 and said he would raise it to 15,000 if needed \u2013 and said soldiers would \u201cfight back\u201d in response to rocks being thrown at them by migrants. He later clarified those comments, saying he hoped \u201cthey won\u2019t have to fire.\u201dFunes didn\u2019t seem deterred, saying, \u201cDonald Trump and any other government has never stopped immigration.\u201d\n\nBut Villanueva expressed some concern with stories of the military presence threat.\n\n\u201cI worry for others in the caravan. You have all kinds of people here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government in the United States is very strong. But we have to try it.\u201d\n\nMore: Tracking Trump\u2019s many threats, claims on immigration, caravan ahead of midterm elections\n\nMore: Trump says troops won't shoot migrants at border\n\nMore: Migrant caravan pushes through perilous stretch as Trump's military warnings continue\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/03/migrant-caravan-donald-trump-honduras-immigration-border-military-troops-immigration/1874115002/", "CLOSE 'The Bachelor' star Sean Lowe discusses the 17th season of the hit ABC dating show.

(AP Photo/Todd Kirkland) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUBURN, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Seth Williams figures there's only one likely outcome on a mid-air battle for the ball, and it's exactly what happened with the game in the balance.\n\nThe Auburn freshman came down with an 11-yard touchdown pass from Jarrett Stidham with 1:41 left and the Tigers rallied to beat No. 25 Texas A&M 28-24 on Saturday.\n\n\"Zero chance I wasn't coming down with it,\" Williams said. \"It's going to come down with me if it's up in the air.\"\n\nThe Tigers (6-3, 3-3 Southeastern Conference) sputtered early on offense but finished with a 14-point outburst over the final 5:14 and the defense came up with big stops. Stidham delivered big plays on both final drives.\n\nKellen Mond and the Aggies (5-4, 3-3) pushed the ball into Auburn territory on their final drive, converting a fourth-and-5. Then a holding call pushed them back across midfield and Mond's desperation pass to the end zone was incomplete.\n\nOfficials put one second back on the clock but Mond was sacked by Nick Coe on the final play.\n\n\"You think the game's over,\" Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. \"The game's over, you shake the other coach's hand ... and then they tell you to come back out.\"\n\nThe Tigers, who had plummeted from a No. 8 ranking, trailed 24-14 before staging the rally. Texas A&M had missed a late field goal following another defensive stand.\n\nStidham started the final drive with a 47-yard pass to Ryan Davis, who spun away from defenders and raced downfield. Then came Williams' second 11-yard touchdown catch of the day, in the back corner of the end zone.\n\nAuburn had gotten new life with the first career interception by Noah Igbinoghene on what Malzahn called \"probably the play of the game.\" Stidham led the Tigers down the field and completed two straight sideline passes to Darius Slayton to set up Chandler Cox's 1-yard touchdown run, making it 24-21.\n\nThe defense held again and Christian Tutt returned a punt to the 42.\n\n\"We knew if we left any life in them, they were going to fight, scratch and claw,\" Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said. \"That's what they always do, and we did that. We played excellent football for three quarters.\"\n\nStidham completed 18 of 29 passes for 239 yards. Slayton had eight catches for 107 yards.\n\nAuburn won despite running for just 19 yards on 21 carries. It was the fewest by the Tigers since gaining 18 against Mississippi State in 2000.\n\nTrayveon Williams ran for 107 yards and two touchdowns for Texas A&M. He caught five passes for 75 yards and a third score.\n\n\"It's a tough way to lose, to dominate the whole game like that,\" Aggies defensive lineman Landis Durham said. \"We preach and preach to finish, and we fell short of that. Now we're hurt.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTexas A&M: Didn't complete a pass until the final play of the first quarter, with Auburn unable to stop the run. Dropped its second straight game. Had a 38:41-21:19 advantage in time of possession.\n\nAuburn: Fought back to avoid a tough loss. The Tigers' running game still isn't producing, netting minus 14 yards in the first quarter. Offense went three-and-out six times.\n\nBEATING THE AGGIES\n\nStidham, a Texas native, took special pleasure in beating a home state team. \"Any time I can beat the Aggies, it's a great day in my book,\" he said.\n\nTRICKERY\n\nAuburn got its first touchdown when receiver Ryan Davis hit Sal Cannella for a 20-yard touchdown on a double pass. That came one play after the Tigers recovered a botched pitch by Kellen Mond.\n\nFISHER VS. MALZAHN\n\nThe two coaches' only head-to-head meeting came in the national championship game to end the 2013 season. Fisher's Florida State team scored in the final seconds to win 34-31.\n\n\"This was a different kind of game,\" Malzahn said. \"It was completely different.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAuburn visits No. 6 Georgia after upsetting the Bulldogs last season before losing to them in the SEC championship game.\n\nTexas A&M hosts Mississippi to start a closing three-game home stand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Tobias Oliver got his chance and ran with it.\n\nOliver rushed for 120 yards and two touchdowns and passed for a score to help Georgia Tech beat North Carolina 38-28 on Saturday.\n\nOliver broke a 28-28 tie with a 1-yard touchdown run with three minutes remaining for the Yellow Jackets (5-4, 3-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), who won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nNorth Carolina (1-7, 1-5) had a chance to answer, but Anree Saint-Amour intercepted Nathan Elliott's pass with 2:44 left to set up Georgia Tech's game-clinching field goal.\n\n\"We did what we had to do to get out of here winning a game,\" Georgia Tech coach Paul Johnson said.\n\nGeorgia Tech, which entered the game averaging a nation-leading 366.5 rushing yards per game, ran for 461 yards against a North Carolina defensive line depleted by injuries and suspensions. It was the Yellow Jackets' fifth 400-yard rushing performance of the season, a school record.\n\nOliver replaced starting quarterback TaQuon Marshall on Georgia Tech's fourth offensive series and played the rest of the game. He threw an 86-yard touchdown pass to Qua Searcy, the team's longest since 2009.\n\nThe performance came nine days after Oliver rushed for 215 yards and three touchdowns in the Yellow Jackets' 49-28 win at Virginia Tech.\n\n\"I feel like it's pretty evident that I can get in and play,\" Oliver said. \"But at the same time, we're at the point in the season where I don't want to get too much that I should be the starter. As of right now, I just want to win.\"\n\nAfter trailing 28-10 in the third quarter, North Carolina scored on three consecutive possessions, tying the game on a 1-yard touchdown run by Antonio Williams and a 2-point conversion.\n\nCole Holcomb had a career-high 22 tackles and three forced fumbles for the Tar Heels.\n\nElliott was replaced in the second quarter by freshman Jace Ruder, who led North Carolina to a field goal and a touchdown on two drives before leaving with an injury. Elliott re-entered the game and finished with no touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nGeorgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets moved above .500 for the first time since the season opener, but it wasn't easy. They survived a series of self-inflicted wounds in the second half, sandwiching a pair of lost fumbles around a botched play on fourth and inches that resulted in a turnover on downs. \"It got a little crazy there,\" Johnson said. \"To their credit, they kept playing and they fought back. And we did most everything we could to try to help them.\"\n\nNorth Carolina: It was another heartbreaker for the Tar Heels, who lost their fifth consecutive game. North Carolina dropped to 5-19 in its last 24 games, a stretch that includes a 2-14 record in conference games and a 2-9 mark at home. \"It's a challenge when you don't have success,\" North Carolina coach Larry Fedora said. \"But I don't worry about the guys in that room getting back up off the mat. I don't worry about what they have inside of them. There's no doubt in my mind what kind of grit they have. They will continue to battle and give everything they have.\"\n\nQB OR NOT QB?\n\nJohnson stuck to his promise to play both of his quarterbacks. Marshall rushed for 61 yards on eight carries, including a 44-yard scamper, before departing. Johnson said he stuck with Oliver because he thought the freshman gave the Yellow Jackets the best chance to win, based on how the game was unfolding. \"It was a gut thing, a feel thing,\" Johnson said. \"Probably the rest of the way, that's kind of what it will be.\"\n\nTHE GOOD SON\n\nGeorgia Tech freshman defensive back Tre Swilling made his first interception, coming up with a one-handed theft of Elliott late in the first quarter. The play snapped Elliott's streak of 219 consecutive passes without an interception. Swilling is the son of former Georgia Tech star Pat Swilling, a former NFL All-Pro selection. His uncles Ken and Darrell were members of the Yellow Jackets' 1990 national championship team.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGeorgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets host Miami, which has beaten them in eight of the last nine meetings.\n\nNorth Carolina: The Tar Heels make the short trip to Duke for their final road game of the season.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence said one of No. 2 Clemson's main goals this year was to have fun.\n\nFew teams in college football appear to be enjoying themselves as much as the surging Tigers.\n\nTravis Etienne ran for 153 yards and two touchdowns and Lawrence, all 350 pounds of him, had a 2-yard scoring run in a 77-16 dismantling of Louisville on Saturday.\n\nLawrence, a junior, thought he would be going it alone this season among defensive line starters with ends Clelin Ferrell and Austin Bryant, and tackle Christian Wilkins all thinking hard about the NFL this past offseason.\n\nInstead, all of Clemson's starters came back for a final try at a national title.\n\n\"Our goal for this year was to just try and enjoy every moment we get with each other, not waste anything,\" Lawrence said. \"Laughing, having fun, dancing, just enjoying everything that comes with football.\"\n\nThe Tigers, who moved to 9-0 for the third time in four years, are doing a lot of that lately. Clemson (6-0 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 2 CFP) can wrap up the ACC Atlantic Division with a win at Boston College next week.\n\nThe highlight Saturday may have been Lawrence's bull rush to the end zone as the lead back \u2014 Wilkins was lined up at tailback \u2014 in Clemson's \"Fridge Package\" that highlights about 675 pounds of defensive line muscle.\n\n\"I try to take advantage of my opportunities,\" Lawrence joked. \"I'm a natural running back, I tell myself.\"\n\nA week ago in a 59-10 win at Florida State, it was Wilkins going in for a score with Lawrence paving the way.\n\n\"I also told (coach Dabo Swinney) that Christian can't score until I get the ball,\" Lawrence said. \"That's how that went down.\"\n\nIt wasn't the only light moment the Tigers had in routing the Cardinals (2-7, 0-6).\n\nLeft tackle Mitch Hyatt, who set a program record for most snaps, caught a pass and Swinney's oldest son, Will, capped the blowout with an 8-yard TD catch in the final quarter.\n\n\"This just shows how much fun we're having,\" Hyatt said.\n\nEtienne went over the 1,000-yard rushing mark and scored his ACC-leading 15th touchdown. Tavien Feaster added 101 yards rushing for the Tigers.\n\nFreshman Lyn-J Dixon ran for 116 yards, the second time this season Clemson has had three runners with 100 or more yards. They finished with a season high 492 yards rushing.\n\nCo-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said even though his group has played strongly the past month, \"we can get to another level and I think we got closer to that today,\" he said.\n\nEtienne and Feaster put Clemson up 14-0 less than three minutes into the game and the Tigers never let up on Louisville (2-7, 0-6).\n\nLinebacker Isaiah Simmons had a pick-six, the Tigers collected six sacks and backup quarterback Chase Brice threw three touchdowns on just seven pass attempts.\n\nThe most crowd-pleasing moment was certainly the touchdown by \"Big Dex,\" the junior projected as a can't-miss NFL first rounder. Most of the 78,741 at Memorial Stadium started to chatter when Lawrence and Wilkins ran out for the goal-line offensive set.\n\nThey erupted when Trevor Lawrence handed off to Dexter Lawrence as the upback who took a step to his left and ran across the line.\n\nWilkins, who celebrates every Clemson TD, hoisted the massive Lawrence into the air.\n\nLouisville lost its sixth straight game, its longest losing streak since dropping 10 in a row in the 1997 and '98 seasons.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals look like they're playing out the string under coach Bobby Petrino and have a difficult finishing stretch with games at Syracuse, and home contests with North Carolina State and Kentucky left.\n\nClemson: The Tigers might finally face their first test since rallying past Syracuse 27-23 back in September when they play at Boston College next week. A difficult road game could certainly challenge the poise of a young quarterback like Trevor Lawrence.\n\nLOUISVILLE STRESS\n\nPetrino said he was disappointed with his team's showing, but believed his team played with effort and kept playing until the end. \"I didn't feel like anyone gave up or anybody quit out there,\" he said. \"They kept competing.\"\n\nLOTS OF POINTS\n\nIt was Clemson's highest scoring game since defeating Wake Forest 82-24 in its national championship season of 1981. The team record in a game is 122 in shutting out Guilford in October 1901.\n\nVERY SNAPPY\n\nHyatt set a program record in the second quarter when he played his 3,362 snap for the Tigers. He surpassed former Clemson center Dalton Freeman, who played 3,361 snaps from 2009-12.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLouisville wraps up its away schedule at Syracuse next Saturday night.\n\nClemson plays its final regular-season road game at BC on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

We could have done better. I'm really, really glad that we won the game. It's an emotional game. It feels good to win.\n\n\"It was a battle. I was proud our team was able to find a way to win. I think our guys were pressed into a corner. Give them (Air Force) credit. They were fighting, too.\"\n\nAir Force (3-6), which beat Navy 35-7 a month ago, is 33-14 in Commander in Chief's Trophy games against Army since the trophy was first awarded in 1972 and could have won the trophy again on Saturday with a victory. The Falcons had won 18 of the previous 21 in the series against the Black Knights, but they couldn't overcome a costly interception by Army's Mike Reynolds at the Army 4 in the final minute of the first half.\n\n\"There was a chance to seize this one, but I'm not putting any blame on the offense at all,\" Air Force linebacker Kyle Johnson said. \"We didn't do the job just the same way they didn't.\"\n\nThe Falcons were unable to score in the opening half with Isaiah Sanders at quarterback, fell behind by two scores, and couldn't recover despite dominating the second half. Air Force outgained Army 212-77 after halftime with Donald Hammond III at quarterback. The Black Knights secured the victory when Hammond was stopped for no gain on a fourth-and-3 play at the Army 40 with under 2 minutes to play.\n\n\"We were driving downfield. We should have made some plays we didn't make,\" Hammond said. \"I just wanted to win this game for the team. We're never going to give up. That's one thing we're not going to do.\"\n\nHammond, who excelled in the victory over Navy, accounting for four touchdowns in his first college start, replaced Sanders to start the third quarter and quickly hit Marcus Bennett for 31 yards into Army territory, but the drive ended when the Falcons were called for an illegal block on a fourth-and-3 play and had to punt.\n\nHammond had completions of 17 yards to Geraud Sanders and 13 yards to Marcus Bennett late in the third quarter, but the Falcons turned the ball over on downs when a fourth-down pass by Hammond attempt fell incomplete.\n\nThe Falcons finally caught a break when safety Jeremy Fejedelem got a hand on a punt by Army's Nick Schrage and it traveled just 4 yards to give Air Force a first down at the Army 34 and they capitalized. Hammond scored from the 1 two plays after converting a fourth-and-1 play, cutting the lead to 14-6 with under a minute to play in the third. Jake Koehnke's point-after try hit the left goalpost and stayed out.\n\nSenior John Abercrombie kicked a 30-yard field goal with 8:35 left to complete a 13-play drive that took 7:19 off the clock on a gusty day and gave Army a 17-6 lead midway through the fourth.\n\nUndaunted, Hammond drove the Falcons 75 yards in 10 plays to pull within a field goal. The drive was kept alive by a pass interference call against Army on a third-and-10 play. Cole Fagan's 30-yard catch-and-run set up Joseph Saucier's 6-yard touchdown run off a pitch.

Because it happened in the second half of the game, White has to sit out for the first half of the Tigers\u2019 next matchup, which happens to be the Alabama game.\n\nCarville \u2014 who is also listed as a professional-in-residence at LSU\u2019s Manship School of Mass Communication \u2014 doesn\u2019t think any of this is a coincidence and said on GameDay:\n\n\u201cTennessee\u2019s best defensive player couldn\u2019t play against Alabama because of the SEC. Missouri\u2019s best defensive player couldn\u2019t play against Alabama because the SEC kicked him out. (Texas) A&M\u2019s best defensive player couldn\u2019t play against Alabama \u2019cause he was taken out. And now, the best defensive player in the conference is not going to play the first half for nothing. He did nothing wrong!\u201d\n\nNone of this should have surprised ESPN because Carville has been outspoke about the call and subsequent suspension for the last two weeks. He accused the SEC of colluding with Alabama in The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge, he doubled-down on The Paul Finebaum Show and he showed up to the GameDay broadcast at LSU wearing a purple sweatshirt alluding to his suspected intentions of SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey.\n\nThat sweatshirt also had the phrase \u201cbec mon tchu s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet\u201d written on it, which translates to \u201ckiss my ass, please\u201d in Cajun French.\n\nEnjoyed @ESPNCFB GameDay this AM defending Devin White\u2019s honor.

Fitzpatrick is running for re-election and has tried to stay away from party labels. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nCLOSE Democrats have midterms momentum, but remember 2016 and don't get comfortable, says columnist Paul Brandus. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 At a time when politics seems more partisan than ever, a handful of candidates in tough races are trying their very best to be seen as members of anything but their own party.\n\nAt a recent debate, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican, told his Democratic opponent to stop calling him a Republican.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing you throw the word \u2018Republican\u2019 out, do your best to try to keep party labels out of the debate,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\nDemocrats in the House have been buoyed by unprecedented levels of enthusiasm and their candidates have put more than 70 seats in play ahead of Election Day.\n\nRepublicans facing suddenly competitive races have moved center, trying to distance themselves from President Donald Trump and some of his most controversial policies, while playing up their bipartisan work. Meanwhile, Democrats suddenly competitive in red and purple districts are running away from the far-left of their party and vowing to work across the aisle.\n\n\u201cApparently Brian Fitzpatrick doesn\u2019t want to be called a Republican,\u201d an ad from Fitzpatrick\u2019s opponent Scott Wallace says. \u201cBut Fitzpatrick votes with Trump 84 percent of the time just like all the other Republicans.\u201d\n\nIt is true that Fitzpatrick has voted with the president 84 percent of the time, according to the nonpartisan website FiveThirtyEight. But Fitzpatrick has also been a vocal critic of the president\u2019s and frequently touts his work with the bipartisan \"Problem Solvers Caucus\" in the House.\n\nMore: Oprah Winfrey says if you don't vote, you are 'dishonoring your family' at Stacey Abrams rally\n\nMore: Trump won them. Republicans rely on them. But what is the future of white evangelicals?\n\nMore: Midterm elections: 5 hot races that could help decide House control\n\n\u201cBrian believes that the constant reference to people's party labels, Democrat or Republican, is precisely what is tearing our country apart,\u201d Fitzpatrick spokeswoman Genevieve Malandra said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a trend in party identification where more people are calling themselves independent. \u2026 However, that\u2019s what they call themselves; now, when you push them, they\u2019re still voting Democrat and Republican. They just don\u2019t want to call themselves that,\u201d Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said. \u201cThey\u2019re a lot like these candidates who are Democrats and Republicans, they just don\u2019t want to use the word to describe themselves.\u201d\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Yoder of Kansas suggested in an interview with The Kansas City Star that he would be a better check on Trump than his Democratic opponent Sharice Davids whose White House fellowship under President Barack Obama extended into the first year of Trump's presidency.\n\nDavids dismissed the attack as laughable, according to The Kansas City Star. While Yoder has opposed some of the president's policies, Trump endorsed him, and he has voted 92 percent of the time with the president, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nHe's not alone, in a handful of races across the country where the president is unpopular, Republicans have promised to push back when needed.\n\n\"I often hear, 'Will you stand up to President Trump?' The answer is yes,\" Republican Senate candidate Bob Hugin says at the beginning of a new ad. Hugin is running in a surprisingly competitive race in New Jersey. The ad does not mention Hugin's role as a top New Jersey fundraiser for Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nThe number of Americans who don\u2019t identify as either a Democrat or Republican is growing. Over the last almost 30 years, Gallup has been tracking what parties voters identify with and found that overall the number who consider themselves independents has risen nearly 10 percentage points, from a third of the electorate in 1989 to 42 percent last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer in vogue to talk about your party affiliation unless you\u2019re running in a primary or your district is very lopsided,\u201d said David Wasserman, the editor of House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cRepublicans know that their brand is suffering right now.\u201d\n\nBut Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the conservative grass-roots group Tea Party Patriots expressed skepticism about the strategy.\n\n\u201cAs far as Republicans who are saying they would be a check on Trump, one thing that I think is very difficult for some Republicans to understand is that you can\u2019t out-liberal a liberal,\u201d said Martin said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a check on the president, I would imagine you\u2019re going to vote Democrat, not Republican,\u201d she added.\n\nIdentifying as a Republican risks getting you tagged with Trump, but Democrats in red or purple districts aren\u2019t eager to remind voters of their party affiliation.\n\n\u201cBecause the Democratic pickup opportunities are expanding to more traditionally Republican-leaning areas, there\u2019s really not a value add to use the limited time you have\u201d to remind people of your party, David de la Fuente, a political analyst at the center-left think tank Third Way told USA TODAY.\n\nDe la Fuente noted that Trump and Republicans are seeking to paint Democrats as out of the mainstream, saying they are part of a \"mob\" of left-wing activists and that is unhelpful in traditionally GOP areas.\n\nDemocrats running in tight House races across the country have promised to work across the aisle and tried to distance themselves from some of the policies of their party's left wing. Dozens of them have also said they wouldn\u2019t vote for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for speaker.\n\nIn fact, one candidate on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s red-to-blue list \u2013 a group of top recruits who are provided organizational and fundraising support from the Democrats\u2019 campaign arm \u2013 isn\u2019t even registered as a Democrat. Alyse Galvin has been selected as the Democratic nominee for the Alaska at-large seat, but she\u2019s an independent.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Senate, the map skews in favor of Republicans. There are 10 Democrats up for re-election in states Trump won in 2016 and is still popular, with just a handful of Republican seats even ranking as competitive. In those states, the Democrats are scrambling to align themselves with the president and touting their work with Republicans. However, unlike Republicans, Democrats aren't necessarily running away from their party but seeking to portray themselves as moderates.\n\nRep. Claire McCaskill, the Democrat trying to hold onto her seat in Missouri using a radio ad to tell voters she's \u201cnot one of those crazy Democrats.\" McCaskill has voted with Trump 45 percent of the time. But McCaskill stuck with Democrats on three major GOP pushes: the effort to repeal Obamacare, overhaul the tax code and confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIf you want somebody to be with the political party 100 percent of the time, I\u2019m not that guy. I\u2019m not about party,\u201d Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, who is in a tough re-election fight in Indiana, says in his closing ad. Donnelly has voted with Trump 54 percent of the time. Like McCaskill, he's stuck with his party on the major GOP priorities such as health care and Kavanaugh's nomination.\n\nOf course, candidates who move too far to the middle run the risk of dampening enthusiasm among their parties' core supporters.\n\nKevin Mack, a lead strategist of Tom Steyer\u2019s super PAC Need to Impeach, said that Democrats \u201cspend millions and millions and millions of dollars to try to convince everybody they\u2019re anything but a Democrat\u201d every cycle, and it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nMack and his group are encouraging all candidates, including those who run in Republican-leaning and evenly divided states, to support impeaching Trump. It\u2019s a position that Democratic leadership has tried to avoid taking over fear that it will turn off independent and moderate voters.\n\n\"The base doesn\u2019t turn out, and they lose,\u201d said Mack.\n\nContributing: Herb Jackson and Nicole Gaudiano\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/03/midterm-elections-2018-some-lawmakers-dodge-party-labels/1862991002/", "POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.

(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Iowa State coach Matt Campbell is a firm believer that great teams win in the red zone.\n\nThey make sure to put points on the board when they venture inside the 20-yard line, and they have the ability to turn teams back when their defense has its back against the wall.\n\nThat proved to be the case Saturday.\n\nBrock Purdy threw a short touchdown pass to cap a three-TD performance, and the Cyclones kept stopping Kansas on fourth down on the doorstep of the end zone, allowing them to cruise to a 27-3 win \u2014 their fourth straight since installing their freshman quarterback under center.\n\n\"There's a lot of confidence down there,\" Campbell said of the red zone. \"We don't have a ton of five-star players so our margin for error is very small.\"\n\nThe margin of victory Saturday was plenty big.\n\nPurdy finished with 263 yards passing in another stellar performance, and his other two TD tosses were big-play strikes to Hakeem Butler. David Montgomery ran for 67 yards and Purdy added 53 more on the ground as the Cyclones (5-3, 4-2) kept alive their hopes of playing in the Big 12 title game.\n\n\"Without a doubt,\" Iowa State defensive end Matt Leo said. \"Just trust the process.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks' Peyton Bender was just 19 of 40 for 185 yards, though he had several passes dropped, including one for a certain TD by Stephon Robinson early in the game. Khalil Herbert added 91 yards on the ground in what amounted to the only bright spot for coach David Beaty's team.\n\nNow, the calls for his job are sure to grow louder.\n\nThe Jayhawks (3-6, 1-5) upset TCU last week to give Beaty a week's reprieve, but his team looked woefully unprepared Saturday. Substitution mistakes, four failed fourth downs and a myriad other issues made for an ugly showing in front of a sparse crowd made up of about 50 percent Iowa State fans.\n\n\"Obviously I didn't do a very good job because things that we've executed well all week, we weren't able to connect on now,\" Beaty said. \"That's unfortunate because they were there. We just weren't able to connect on them. That comes down to the person coaching them. That's me.\"\n\nAt least Purdy and Butler gave those wearing red a chance to cheer.\n\nAfter forcing an early three-and-out, the Cyclones needed three plays for their young quarterback to hit his tall, lanky wide receiver deep downfield. Butler was so far behind the coverage on their 83-yard TD strike that the Jayhawks gave up and jogged behind him to the end zone.\n\nThen, after another three-and-out, the Cyclones needed only two plays for Purdy to hit his big-play target downfield. Butler leaped over Hasan Defense to snare the jump ball, then turned and coasted 51 yards for another touchdown and a 14-0 lead.\n\nThe Cyclones tacked on a pair of field goals as they built a 20-3 halftime lead.\n\n\"Coach had a great gameplan, he had us in position to make many plays, and we ain't do it,\" Defense said. \"So we shouldn't have been down to where we felt we had to bounce back.\"\n\nPurdy added his third touchdown toss when he found Matthew Eaton open early in the third quarter to make it 27-3, and Iowa State merely coasted the rest of the way.\n\n\"We had plenty of opportunities. We weren't able to make those opportunities count when we needed them,\" Beaty said. \"They just kind of have progressed a little bit faster than we have offensively. We got to be better than what we were.\"\n\nHONORS ALL AROUND\n\nFor its \"Salute to Service\" weekend, the Jayhawks honored Kansas alumni and Marine Corps veterans Rob Riggle and Billy Mills during the game. Riggle has gone on to a successful acting career while Mills won gold at the 1964 Summer Olympics in the 10,000 meters before becoming a humanitarian.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIowa State: Purdy has gained confidence with each start, and it showed in the way he toyed with the Jayhawks' defense. He deftly picked apart a bunch that played well a week ago against the Horned Frogs, and his ability to extend plays with his legs make the Cyclones a challenge to stop.\n\nKansas: New athletic director Jeff Long will no doubt take a close look at Beaty's future with the program. The fact that the Jayhawks appeared uninspired and unprepared was bad enough, but the ocean of empty seats at Memorial Stadium each Saturday has become too difficult to ignore.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIowa State tries to become bowl-eligible against Baylor next Saturday.\n\nKansas heads down Interstate 70 to face Kansas State next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Michael Dwyer, AP)\n\nA quick glance at items of interest as Week 9 rolls on \u2026\n\nWho\u2019s hot\n\nTom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. Fitting, that on the weekend featuring the season\u2019s most alluring collection of marquee matchups (and not because Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield will be slinging in Cleveland), the NFL\u2019s \u201cwinningest quarterback\u201d faces off against the man many declare as the NFL\u2019s \u201cbest quarterback\u201d in the Sunday night showcase.\n\nIt\u2019s just the second time that Brady and Rodgers square off (Rodgers 1, Brady 0, Lambeau Field). Maybe the next time it will happen in a Super Bowl. Sure, Brady doesn\u2019t have to personally defend Rodgers as member of the secondary, and vice versa. But it\u2019s head-to-head nonetheless because points add pressure to the other quarterback. With neither of these megastar quarterbacks supported by a dominant defense, it looks like a shootout waiting to happen at Gillette Stadium. And it feels so dramatic, like maybe \u2026 last man with the football wins.\n\nPressure\u2019s on\n\nCase Keenum and John Elway. Whatever Elway, the Broncos\u2019 football architect, thought he would get in signing Keenum for $18 million per year hasn\u2019t happened. Chances are it never will. Keenum\u2019s history of turnover problems has followed him to Denver; he\u2019s had more turnovers (11) than TD passes (10). As Houston visits on Sunday, reminders will be in the wind. Keenum started his journeyman career with the Texans \u2013 who just obtained one of Keenum\u2019s primary weapons, Demaryius Thomas, in a Tuesday trade.\n\nKey matchup\n\nCooper Kupp vs. P.J. Williams. Kupp had a huge game (eight catches, 116 yards) when the Rams beat the Saints in L.A. last December, and now he\u2019s returning after missing the past two contests with a knee sprain. Williams -- picked on and victimized early by the Vikings last weekend before rebounding with a couple of big plays -- could draw a significant amount of work against Kupp in the slot.\n\nBut recently obtained Eli Apple is an option, too. It won\u2019t be as simple as assigning Pro Bowler Marshon Lattimore to the task because of Jared Goff\u2019s other receivers \u2013 Brandin Cooks (returning to New Orleans) and Robert Woods. These match-ups will be critical for the showdown on Sunday, when the Saints try to knock off the NFL\u2019s only undefeated team. And the Saints realize the coverage on the back end begins with the rush up front.\n\nNext man up\n\nGregg Williams. With Hue Jackson and O-coordinator Todd Haley shown the door this week, Williams is essentially the last man standing from the trio of alpha dog personalities handling the Browns\u2019 top coaching posts. Guess you can never say never. When Williams was banned from the NFL a few years ago for playing a leading role in the Bountygate scandal, it seemed safe to suggest that the intense-but-disgraced defensive ace would never land another head-coaching gig. Now he\u2019s the interim coach of the Browns. Odd how a 3-36-1 record \u2013 Jackson\u2019s mark during his Browns tenure \u2013 will lead to an opportunity. For somebody.\n\nMORE: NFL Week 9 matchups: Can Packers' defense hold firm against Tom Brady, Patriots?\n\nMORE: NFL midseason winners and losers\n\nRookie watch\n\nOrlando Brown Jr. The son of a former Raven, the late namesake who was nicknamed \u201cZeus,\u201d Brown will start again at right tackle, subbing for the injured James Hurst for the intense A-North rivalry game against the Steelers. A third-round pick from Oklahoma, Brown is starting his NFL career exactly where he wanted \u2013 expressing as much in a heartfelt letter to Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome before the draft.\n\nBaltimore didn\u2019t particularly plan for such a fast ascent to the lineup, but Brown has demonstrated gradual improvement and reduced some of the body fat that represented a pre-draft concern. And circumstances have dictated some quick adjustments, which also apply at left tackle as second-year swing man Jermaine Eluemunor subs for the injured Ronnie Stanley.\n\nIf the playoffs were today\u2026\n\nThe Seahawks (4-3), hosting the Chargers on Sunday, would be in as the sixth seed in the NFC. With a two-game winning streak and the only loss during a five-game span being a two-point setback against the Rams, Seattle has quietly emerged as a wild-card contender. It will be a crowded race, with two of the three NFC North teams (Chicago, Minnesota, Green Bay) and Philadelphia (if it can\u2019t catch Washington) in the mix. For the Seahawks to hang on for a playoff berth, they will have to survive a gauntlet of a schedule that includes a three-game stretch against the Rams, Packers and Panthers and a late-December matchup against the Chiefs.\n\nStomach for an upset\n\nAtlanta at Washington. The NFC East title is Washington\u2019s to lose \u2026 or win. No, this isn\u2019t the same Jay Gruden team that in 2016 was positioned for a playoff push at 6-3-1 in mid-November, then faded down the stretch and finished 8-7-1. This team has a better defense, an Adrian Peterson-inspired running game and steady Alex Smith at QB.\n\nThen again, Washington (5-2) still needs to prove it won\u2019t squander its lead as Philadelphia regroups. The last time the R\u2019s faced a potent passing attack, the Saints ran them out of the Superdome. This time, playing on grass at home, should help. And Peterson gets a crack at an injury-depleted Atlanta defense. Yet the Falcons (3-4) are desperate, which might be one reason the home team is favored by just two points.\n\nStat\u2019s the fact\n\nWith a big game at Cleveland, Chiefs QB Mahomes could become just the second thrower in NFL history to pass for 300 yards in eight consecutive games within a season. Andrew Luck was the first in 2014. Think about that: Marino, Favre, Elway, Montana, Manning, Brady, Moon. None of them hit that mark, though Drew Brees had a streak of seven straight 300-yard games in 2011. And Mahomes is in his first year as a starter.", "Rutgers's Kiy Hester stops Wisconsin's Jake Ferguson after a catch during the first half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Madison, Wis.

He's a great player and does a lot of good things,\" right tackle David Edwards said.\n\nEspecially after the Badgers (6-3, 4-2 Big Ten) lost starting quarterback Alex Hornibrook at halftime with a head injury.\n\nAll backup quarterback Jack Coan had to do in the third quarter was hand off to his running backs.\n\nThe Badgers had 13 plays, all runs, for 163 yards in the quarter to turn a 10-0 halftime lead into a comfortable 24-3 advantage. Taylor, who had 27 carries on the day, scored on runs from 38 and 18 yards in the third.\n\n\"The second half, we misfit some run pressures. He got on us for some big plays because of that,\" Rutgers coach Chris Ash said.\n\nTaylor even surprised Edwards on the 18-yard score with 43 seconds left in the third.\n\n\"When he took that power play backside and I felt him go past me, I was like 'What is happening right now?'\" Edwards recounted. \"That never, ever happens.\"\n\nRyan Connelly led a strong effort from the front seven with eight tackles, while Andrew Van Ginkel blocked a field-goal attempt for Wisconsin, which gained bowl eligibility.\n\nWisconsin had the edge in talent over the Scarlet Knights (1-8, 0-6), the only team still winless in Big Ten play. Still, the first half had the sluggish pace of a nonconference game in early September.\n\nSaquon Hampton picked off Hornibrook twice in the first half. The defense also held Wisconsin scoreless after a drive that started at the Rutgers 41 set up by D'Cota Dixon's 34-yard return of Van Ginkel's blocked field goal.\n\nRunning back Raheem Blackshear had eight catches for 162 yards and a touchdown to lead Rutgers, often getting chunk plays on screens or short passes as the Badgers tried to swarm freshman quarterback Artur Sitkowski.\n\n\"He can do everything, pass block, he can run, he can catch the ball. We should definitely build off him,\" Sitkowski said.\n\nBlackshear also ran for 38 yards for 10 carries to give him 200 yards of total offense on the afternoon. Sitkowski was 20 of 39 for 261 yards but absorbed several hits from unblocked defenders.\n\nRutgers finally got its first touchdown with 8:14 left on Jonathan Hilliman's 1-yard run to get within 14.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nRutgers: Trailing just 10-0 at the half might have been victory enough for the Scarlet Knights. Despite a big day by Taylor, the defense limited the Wisconsin passing game. Rutgers has allowed an average of 24.5 points over its last games, when coach Ash has taken a bigger role in defensive planning, after giving up 40.8 over its first six losses.\n\n\"We haven't made any changes,\" Ash said. \"We just tried to get the guys, their attitude and their effort to show up and that's really been the difference.\"\n\nWisconsin: Hornibrook was 7 of 16 for 92 yards before leaving at the half with a head injury. His first pick came after trying to loft a pass to tight end Kyle Penniston, who had defenders behind him and an in front of him. The second interception came on a late throw on an out patter, with Hampton making an athletic grab. Coan was 5 of 7 for 64 yards and an 11-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to receiver Danny Davis. The sophomore needs every snap of experience he can get if he'll be needed to start next week at Penn State.\n\nQB CONCERNS\n\nHornibrook got hurt on the last play of the first half after being sacked. Coach Paul Chryst said that he held out after being evaluated at the half.\n\nHornibrook missed last week's loss at Northwestern while in the concussion protocol.\n\n\"That's the biggest concern right now, is where Alex is with his health, and then Jack continuing to work and improve,\" Chryst said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRutgers: Hosts Michigan on Nov. 10.\n\nWisconsin: At Penn State on Nov. 10 for first trip to Beaver Stadium since 2012.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gary Cameron) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) \u2014 A tumultuous week for Maryland ended with a sobering defeat.\n\nMichigan State capped a rough stretch for the unsettled Terrapins football program, using a stout defensive performance to secure a 24-3 victory on Saturday.\n\nThe Terrapins (5-4, 3-3 Big Ten) managed only 100 yards and nine first downs for interim coach and offensive coordinator Matt Canada.\n\nConnor Heyward ran for 157 yards and two touchdowns to help the Spartans (6-3, 4-2 Big Ten) become a bowl eligible for the 11th time in 12 years, the only exception a 3-9 stumble in 2016.\n\nThe loss followed the reinstatement, then dismissal, of Maryland head coach DJ Durkin over the span of two days.\n\n\"This week was a challenging week. That's a fact. You guys all know that,\" Canada said. \"But we came in and worked every day. Our kids played hard. We lost today because we just didn't play well enough. We played a really good football team and I didn't coach well enough.\"\n\nCanada spoke alone, opting not to make the players available to the media.\n\n\"Our players are more than capable of speaking and they will,\" Canada said. \"They've had a big week, a challenging week.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Durkin was reinstated by the University System board of regents following a probe into the culture of the football program. The investigation was launched soon after school president Wallace Loh acknowledged in August that \"mistakes were made\" in the treatment of Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair, who collapsed during an offseason workout and died two weeks later of heatstroke.\n\nThe decision to bring Durkin back from paid administrative leave created such a furor among students and politicians that Loh fired Durkin on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, the board of regents chairman resigned from his post.\n\nSeveral outlets reported that three players walked out of a meeting with Durkin on Tuesday. After practice that day, the backup punter, who had spoken out about the coaching staff, was reportedly assaulted by a teammate who supported Durkin.\n\nComing off all those distractions, the Terrapins were looking to become bowl eligible with their third win in four games. Instead, they fell behind early and never got the offense working.\n\nThe Spartans scored on their first possession, added a first-quarter field goal and went up 17-3 in the third quarter when Max Rosenthal recovered a Heyward fumble in the end zone.\n\n\"Huge win for us,\" Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said. \"We stayed focused on the task at hand, which was to win No. 6.\"\n\nDantonio fully understood Maryland's unique situation.\n\n\"I'm sure there were a lot of distractions. They have faced a very emotional tragedy earlier in the year,\" Dantonio said. \"For that, we are all very sorry. Everything else that's going on is difficult for us to comprehend, being on the outside looking in. But our thoughts and our prayers go with the McNair family and also our thoughts are with the entire Maryland football program as they move through challenging times.\"\n\nMaryland's effort to come back was thwarted by two fourth-quarter turnovers. Javon Leake lost a fumble on the MSU 26 and Byron Cowart fumbled on an interception return with the Spartans recovering in the end zone for a touchback.\n\n\"We make that score, it's 17-10 with 11 minutes to go, we're right in the game,\" Canada said.\n\nOn the next play, Heyward ran for an 80-yard touchdown for a 24-3 lead with 11 minutes left.\n\n\"I don't know how to describe it,\" Heyward said. \"You're just smiling and then looking at the Jumbo screen hoping you don't get caught.\"\n\nMaryland's strong running game was limited to 26 yards (on 29 carries) by the nation's top-ranked rushing defense. Kasim Hill went 8 for 21 for 74 yards for the Terps on a very windy day.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan State: After putting off a decision on his starting quarterback until late in the week, Dantonio settled on senior Brian Lewerke, who returned from a shoulder injury to go 11 for 20 for 87 yards and an interception before being replaced by redshirt freshman Rocky Lombardi.\n\n\"I know there were a lot of distractions this week over here (at Maryland), but same for us, not knowing exactly what's going on as well,\" Dantonio said.\n\nThe Spartans have some work to do in the passing game, but the defense is good enough to make up for that and keep them competitive against any foe.\n\nMaryland: When the Terps are bad, they're bad. Maryland's one-dimensional offense sputtered again, and those two turnovers in the fourth quarter didn't help. Maryland's four losses this season have come by a combined 86 points.\n\nEJECTED\n\nTerrapins defensive tackle Mbi Tanyi was ejected in the second quarter for throwing a punch at a Michigan State player.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans host No. 8 Ohio State.\n\nMaryland: The Terrapins travel to Indiana.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That\u2019s what makes Baltimore\u2019s win at Heinz Field so much more impressive. At home, Joe Flacco hasn\u2019t thrown an interception this season, compared to six on the road. The offensive line has also given up twice the amount of sacks when on the road, five at home as opposed to 10 on the road.\n\nThe defense has seven more sacks on the road as opposed to at home, but that\u2019s thanks in large part to their record 11 sack performance in Tennessee. Without that, they have four less sacks on the road and recently the Ravens pass rush has been non-existent.\n\nThe Ravens seem to feed off of the energy of their fans, and M&T Bank Stadium is not an easy place to play.

Masip touched the ball but couldn't keep it from going in. The league credited the 18-year-old Vinicius with the goal.\n\nSergio Ramos added a second goal from the penalty spot in the 88th after Karim Benzema was fouled by Fernando Calero.\n\nUntil then, Valladolid threatened to extend Madrid's winless run. Ruben Alcaraz and Toni Villa hit the woodwork for the visitors with long strikes in the second half.\n\nMadrid's first win in six rounds lifted it from ninth to sixth place.\n\nMadrid's fans jeered its players when Valladolid went close to scoring, and especially when ineffective forwards Gareth Bale and Marco Asensio were substituted at 0-0.\n\n\"We understand how our supporters feel,\" Ramos said. \"We, as players, are the ones who are responsible (for the poor run) and we are the ones who have the opportunity to turn this around.

The Texas Rangers have hired Dodgers third base coach Chris Woodward as their manager, six weeks after Jeff Banister was fired. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers third base coach Chris Woodward was hired as manager of the Texas Rangers on Saturday, six weeks after Jeff Banister was fired.\n\nHe received a three-year contract with a club option for 2022. He will be introduced at a news conference Monday.\n\nWoodward inherits a team that went 67-95 and finished last in the AL West, with the focus turning to the development of younger players. Texas had its first consecutive losing seasons since 2005-08.\n\nThe hiring ended a process during which general manager Jon Daniels and the Rangers interviewed more than 10 candidates, including bench coach Don Wakamatsu after he served as interim coach the final 10 games of the season.\n\nWoodward was interviewed this week after the Dodgers finished their second straight season in which they advanced to the World Series, losing both times. The last team before Los Angeles that appeared in consecutive World Series without winning the title was Texas in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\"We interviewed a number of strong candidates during an extensive interview process for our managerial role and believe we have found the right fit in Chris Woodward,\" Daniels said in a statement released by the team. \"We look forward to working with him and everyone on the baseball staff to develop and grow a culture that will lead to success for many years to come.\"\n\nDaniels has hired three managers in his 13 seasons as the Rangers GM, and all were first-time MLB managers. Texas won its only American League pennants during Ron Washington's eight seasons before Banister won two AL West titles in his four seasons.\n\nTwo candidates Texas interviewed were hired last month as managers by other teams, David Bell in Cincinnati and Rocco Baldelli in Minnesota. The hiring of Woodward left the Baltimore Orioles, who fired Buck Showalter after the season, as the only MLB team with a managerial vacancy.\n\nThe 42-year-old Woodward spent the past three years on the staff of manager Dave Roberts, after working for Seattle the previous three years. He started his coaching career as minor league infield coordinator for the Mariners in 2013, then joined their big league staff later that year. He was Seattle's infield coach in 2014 and the first base coach in 2015.\n\n\"Chris brings high energy, outstanding leadership and communication skills, a strong knowledge of the game and its evolving strategies, and great integrity \u2014 attributes that we feel are vital for our next manager,\" Daniels said. \"We believe these traits will resonate with our players, our staff, and our fans. He has also been a big part of a very successful stretch in Los Angeles.\"\n\nAs a player, Woodward spent 12 seasons (1999-2011) with five teams \u2014 Toronto, the New York Mets, Seattle, Atlanta and Boston. He hit .239 with 33 home runs and 191 RBIs while playing every position except pitcher and catcher.\n\nWoodward was teammates with Adrian Beltre for a short period during the 2009 season with the Mariners. Beltre, who has 3,166 career hits, just completed his 21st big league season and hasn't said yet if he will return to play for the Rangers again next year.\n\nWhen Beltre went on the disabled list during the 2009 season, Woodward started 13 games at third base in his place. Soon after Beltre's return that August, Woodward was selected off waivers by the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThe Rangers went 87-75 in 2009 before their two World Series seasons, then lost in the AL's first one-and-done wild-card game in 2012. They ended the 2013 regular season with a loss to Tampa Bay in a wild-card tiebreaker.\n\nWhen Banister was fired Sept. 21 with 10 games left in this season, Daniels acknowledged that the decision wasn't based on the record and said instead that it was time for a new voice in leadership. Banister was under contract through next season.\n\nWoodward is a native of Covina, California, as is Michael Young, the Rangers career leader in hits and games played who is now a special assistant to the general manager. They are the same age but played at different high schools.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 Bayern Munich's attempt to keep the pressure on Borussia Dortmund ahead of their Bundesliga encounter next weekend was undermined after conceding a late draw with Freiburg on Saturday.\n\nDortmund held on for a 1-0 win at Wolfsburg and will lead by four points before Bayern's visit on Saturday.\n\nBayern dominated possession against Freiburg but found it hard to create chances against the visitors' well-organized defense, frustrating some home fans who whistled their team at the break.\n\nFreiburg had a goal ruled out for offside early in the second half.\n\nBayern claimed a penalty for an apparent hand ball by Freiburg defender Manuel Gulde but referee Felix Zwayer gave a corner instead after consulting video replays. Franck Ribery had an arguably better penalty appeal waived away.\n\nGermany striker Serge Gnabry finally broke the deadlock with 10 minutes remaining, beating Alexander Schwolow at his near post to set off celebrations among Bayern's coaching staff.\n\nThey were cut short, however, when Christian Guenter crossed for striker Lucas Hoeler to equalize on 1-1 in the 89th minute.\n\nDespite unconvincing performances, Bayern had been looking for a fifth straight win in all competitions after getting over a slump of four games with none.\n\n\"You could see that we never shined in the past weeks. Then you can't play with ease, that's clear,\" Bayern captain Manuel Neuer acknowledged. \"But we still had times in the game in which we played really well. The question is, why don't we keep doing that?\"\n\nDORTMUND DEFENDS\n\nAfter conceding a late equalizer against Hertha Berlin the weekend before, Dortmund successfully defended Marco Reus' first-half goal to stay unbeaten.\n\nDortmund had problems in defense, with Manuel Akanji (hip), Lukasz Piszczek (knee), Marcel Schmelzer (knee) and Abdou Diallo (groin) all out injured.\n\nLucien Favre, the first Dortmund coach to stay unbeaten after 15 competitive games, made nine changes from the team that beat Union Berlin 3-2 in the German Cup on Wednesday, with Paco Alcacer coming in for a rare start.\n\nThe Spain striker, who had seven goals in four league appearances, failed to score for the first time in his sixth game for Dortmund.\n\nReus, who scored with a late penalty for the win over Union, again starred, heading home from close range after Thomas Delaney failed to direct his header on target.\n\nSCHALKE FINALLY WINS\n\nSchalke was testing its fans' patience with only one goal in four league games and nerves were strained before the game against fellow struggler Hannover.\n\nMark Uth, yet to score for the team since his summer transfer from Hoffenheim, was awarded a spot kick in the second half after falling under minimal contact from Hannover goalkeeper Philipp Tschauner.

(Alessandro Di Marco/ANSA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMILAN (AP) \u2014 Inter Milan and Napoli are blasting opponents while Juventus seems content to grind out results in Serie A.\n\nJuventus barely stepped out of first gear to beat Cagliari 3-1 on Saturday ahead of its Champions League meeting with Manchester United on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Inter and Napoli both scored five goals in their wins against Genoa and Napoli but they remain six points behind Juventus, which faces Milan next Sunday in a tricky week for the defending Italian champion.\n\n\"We struggled to score the second goal and we drifted out of the game a bit,\" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. \"We need to improve in defending in our half of the pitch: We think we can always score two or three goals but it's not always like that.\"\n\nFAST START\n\nJuventus took just 44 seconds to score. Rodrigo Bentancur threaded the ball to Paulo Dybala, who twisted his way past two defenders before firing into the bottom right corner.\n\nJoao Pedro leveled in the 36th, bringing down a cross from the right and swiveling to drill into the bottom near corner.\n\nHowever, Juventus was back in front less than two minutes later when Croatia midfielder Filip Bradaric put Douglas Costa's cross into his own net.\n\nIt was an eventful first half as each side also had penalty appeals waived away, while Cristiano Ronaldo sent an effort crashing off the left post.\n\nJuan Cuadrado sealed the match three minutes from time with his first goal of the season. Dybala picked out Ronaldo, who ran nearly half the length of the pitch before rolling across for Cuadrado to blast it into the back of the net.\n\nCHALLENGERS\n\nRoberto Gagliardini scored twice and Matteo Politano, Joao Mario, and Radja Nainggolan added the other goals as Inter beat Genoa 5-0 for a seventh successive Serie A win.\n\nThe result boosted Inter's confidence for Tuesday's Champions League game at home with Barcelona. The Catalan club beat Inter 2-0 two weeks ago.\n\nGenoa, the only team to have taken points off Juventus this season, remained 11th but only four points off fourth spot.\n\nInter captain Mauro Icardi was rested for the match, while Genoa forward Krzysztof Piatek was surprisingly also on the bench despite having scored a leading nine goals.\n\nInter took control in the first half with two goals in as many minutes from Gagliardini and Politano \u2014 both of them following mistakes by the Genoa defense.\n\nGenoa offered little, even when Piatek was sent on for former Inter forward Goran Pandev, five minutes into the second half.\n\nJoao Mario capped a great individual performance with a second-half goal and also set up the other two, including for Nainggolan, who scored minutes after coming off the bench for his first appearance since injuring his ankle in the derby against AC Milan last month.\n\nLATE LEVELER\n\nAlessandro Florenzi scored late on to rescue a 1-1 draw for Roma at Fiorentina.\n\nRoma seemed to be heading for defeat when, five minutes from fulltime, Fiorentina goalkeeper Alban Lafont parried Aleksandar Kolarov's cross straight at Florenzi, who leveled with a scuffed volley.\n\nBoth teams are two points behind fourth-placed Milan.\n\nRoma visits CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Vadim Ghirda, AP)\n\nGive Simone Biles all the medals.\n\nNow. And, if we\u2019re being honest, again in two years at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nBiles capped off the best meet of her career with yet another milestone Saturday, claiming a gold on floor exercise and a bronze on balance beam to become the first woman in 30 years to win a medal on all six events at the world gymnastics championships or Olympics. For those keeping track, she leaves worlds with four golds, including a record fourth all-around title.\n\nOh, and she\u2019s only a year and a day removed from her return to the gym after taking a year off following the Rio Olympics. If this is what she can accomplish in a year, imagine what she\u2019ll do with the two years before Tokyo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my performances here,\u201d Biles said. \u201cI wish some of them would have been better, but I\u2019m proud of the outcome.\u201d\n\nBiles already holds the record for most career world titles by a gymnast, male or female, with her floor gold giving her 14. She tied Svetlana Khorkina\u2019s record of 20 career medals at these worlds and, barring injury, will pass the Russian next year in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nProbably Vitaly Scherbo, too, who holds the overall mark with 23.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a case of her running circles around inferior competition. Biles is just really that good.\n\nHer teammates during the run-up to the Rio Olympics used to joke about the \u201cSimone division,\u201d saying finishing second to her was as good as winning. It\u2019s even more true now.\n\nGymnastics is a sport that depends on muscle memory, and taking as much time off as Biles did would normally require a slow rebuild. Months of conditioning, followed by the gradual reconstructing of skills and routines.\n\nNot for Biles. She regained her skills in a matter of weeks, and quickly moved on to upping her previous gold-medal game.\n\nThere is, of course, her new vault, which will soon be named after her. It\u2019s a roundoff with a half-twist onto the vaulting table and then a front double full somersault off, and it\u2019s so hard some of the top men can\u2019t even do it. She also added difficulty to her floor routine.\n\nAnd perhaps most impressively, she transformed herself on uneven bars.\n\nBiles was never bad at bars, but she hated them and that discomfort often showed. New coach Laurent Landi is a bars savant, though, and he has turned Biles into one of the best bar workers in the world.\n\nShe has the silver medal to prove it, her first at worlds on uneven bars.\n\n\u201cMost definitely the bar medal,\u201d she said when asked which of her medals at this worlds meant the most. \u201cJust because I worked really hard.\u201d\n\nWhile Biles said she, Landi and his wife and co-coach, Cecile, will need to talk about what new tricks she\u2019ll try and master next, it\u2019s a good bet there will be something in store. After she takes care of that kidney stone that kept her in the emergency room until 1 a.m. the night before qualifying, of course.\n\nThe whole reason Biles came back was to test herself, and she won\u2019t be content to maintain the status quo. Which means the team, all-around, vault and floor exercise golds in Tokyo are already spoken for. Maybe balance beam, too, now that Biles has a bronze medal to remind herself that she\u2019s pretty good on it.\n\nDespite a few wobbles Saturday, Biles stayed on the beam. That alone is an improvement from the all-around final, when she had to jump off after a forward somersault.\n\n\u201cTo be completely honest, I\u2019m really just happy I stayed on the beam,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing into this world championships, I wasn\u2019t as confident as I used to be on beam. So I think it\u2019s a step forward, and hopefully here on out, it can only improve.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of doing better, it\u2019s high time for USA Gymnastics to stop being a perpetual train wreck.\n\nIt has been more than two years since longtime team physician Larry Nassar was revealed as a serial pedophile. Yet lawsuits filed by the survivors remain unsettled. USA Gymnastics is searching for its fourth CEO since March 2017. It continues to employ chief operating officer Ron Galimore, whose role in helping provide cover for Nassar was detailed back in May by The Indianapolis Star, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nUSA Gymnastics needs to find a way forward because it\u2019s the right thing to do. But also because the continuing furor over the federation\u2019s ineptitude overshadows Biles, herself a survivor.\n\nEven during world championships, Biles was barely off the medals podium before something would happen to shift the focus away from her. While it\u2019s wholly understandable, it\u2019s also incredibly unfair to Biles, who is doing things people will still be marveling over decades from now.\n\nBiles deserves to have all of the recognition to herself.\n\nAll of the medals, too.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "At 2-6, the Arizona Cardinals don\u2019t have much of a chance at the postseason. They have a very good chance at landing the first overall pick in the 2019 draft. Nonetheless, their playoff chances are not completely gone.\n\nAccording to win projections and playoff chances by Cynthia Freland, the Cardinals have the smallest of chances to be a postseason team.\n\nThat percentage is 0.1 percent, based on her model of 20,000 simulations.\n\nThey are projected to get exactly four wins, or pick up two more the rest of the season.\n\nThe Cardinals should improve their O-line this offseason to better complement quarterback Josh Rosen\u2019s skill set in Year 2 of his NFL career.\n\nThey have two winnable games left on the schedule. They have the Oakland Raiders and Detroit Lions both at home. Any win beyond those two would be a huge surprise.\n\n0.1 percent isn\u2019t really a chance, but it does mean they are not mathematically eliminated. Of course, based on a four-win season, the Cardinals would be in line to land a top-five pick in the draft, which might be a decent consolation in a bad season, especially when the Cardinals seem to already have their quarterback of the future in place.\n\nListen to the latest from Cards Wire\u2019s Jess Root on his podcast, Rise Up, See Red.

Both prospects project to be day one or two picks come April. Cornerback Deandre Baker, pass rusher D\u2019Andre Walker and safety J.R.

Both quarterbacks will irresponsibly be compared to former prospects that far outplayed where they currently stand. Wolverine\u2019s back Karan Higdon and Lion\u2019s back Miles Sanders have both seen rises in their draft stock so far this season.\n\nThe Wolverine\u2019s are missing defensive linemen Rashan Gary to injury, but still have Chase Winovich rushing the passer and linebacker Devin Bush patrolling behind him. They also boast one of the best cornerbacks in the Big10 in Lavert Hill.\n\nThe Nittany Lions defense boasts a bit less, but still has talent in conerbacks Amani Oruwariye and John Reid along with edge rusher Shareef Miller, but they are still worth an eye, especially Oruwariye.

Nathan Rousseau Smith has the story. Buzz60\n\nBrett Kavanaugh at his Supreme Court confirmation hearing on Sept. 27, 2018. (Photo: Pool photo by Jim Bourg)\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who vowed to focus the midterm election campaign on \u201ccaravans and Kavanaugh,\u201d swung back to the Supreme Court issue online and at a rally Saturday by blasting a small player in Senate confirmation hearings who allegedly admitted to making false statements about then-nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley asked the federal authorities on Friday to investigate a woman by the name of Judy Munro-Leighton who he said made false claims against the now-confirmed Supreme Court justice.\n\nGrassley said Munro-Leighton initially took responsibility for authoring an anonymous \"Jane Doe\" letter that made allegations that Kavanaugh and a friend raped her. After she was tracked down and interviewed by Senate investigators, Grassley said, the woman purportedly recanted and said she had never met Kavanaugh and \"just wanted to get attention.\"\n\nShe says she was, in fact, not the \"Jane Doe,\" whose letter postmarked in California had become public with the release of documents by Grassley's committee, according to Grassley.\n\nMunro-Leighton, from Kentucky, was not one of the primary accusers brought up during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court.\n\nGrassley says the woman is a \"left-wing activist\" and told investigators her initial claim to being the author of the \"Jane Doe\" letter was \"just a ploy,\" he wrote. Her full comments to investigators were not made available and efforts by USA TODAY to reach Munro-Leighton were unsuccessful.\n\nTrump picked up the Supreme Court theme in a Saturday tweet, saying, \"A vicious accuser of Justice Kavanaugh has just admitted that she was lying, her story was totally made up, or FAKE!\u201d\n\nA vicious accuser of Justice Kavanaugh has just admitted that she was lying, her story was totally made up, or FAKE!

Where are the Dems on this?\u201d\n\nHe continued his attack at a Montana rally Saturday, telling voters the whole story was a \"lie.\"\n\n\"She lied about the story, about rape,\" Trump said. \"About rape, she lied and then we're supposed to sit back and take it.\"\n\nThe president appeared to use the issue to cast doubt on other claims made against Kavanaugh.\n\n\"What about the others?\" he asked. \"What are they gonna say happened?\"\n\nThe \u201cJane Doe\u201d letter and Munro-Leighton's bit player role contrasts with the lengthy public appearance at the September hearing by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed he had assaulted her when they were in high school. She has stood by her charges, despite denials by Kavanaugh under oath.\n\nToday, Chairman @ChuckGrassley referred Judy Munro-Leighton to @TheJusticeDept for investigation for making materially false statements to the Committee during the course of its investigation. https://t.co/pNfhLRnETy \u2014 Senate Judiciary (@senjudiciary) November 2, 2018\n\nAlthough Trump later mocked Ford\u2019s appearance at the hearing, he initially said her testimony was \u201cvery compelling,\u201d calling her a \u201cvery credible witness.\"\n\nGrassley\u2019s letter on the Munro-Leighton incident marks at least the fourth request Grassley has made of federal authorities to investigate those involved in the controversial Kavanaugh proceedings, which were extended due to a series of sexual assault allegations surfacing when Kavanaugh was in high school and college.\n\nAmong accusers who came forth during the hearings is 43-year-old Deborah Ramirez, who, according to The New Yorker, alleges that Kavanaugh \u201cthrust his penis in her face\u201d during a party.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Luis Suarez is making sure Barcelona keeps on winning without the injured Lionel Messi.\n\nSuarez came to the rescue of Barcelona on Saturday with a two-goal performance that included a 90th-minute winner to cap a 3-2 comeback at Rayo Vallecano.\n\nSuarez's double gives him six goals for Barcelona since Messi went down with a broken right forearm on Oct. 20. He leads the Spanish league with nine goals in 11 rounds.\n\n\"The game was very difficult for us, but we knew how to turn it around,\" Suarez said. \"You can lose leagues at grounds like this one.\"\n\nBarcelona increased its league lead to four points over Altetico Madrid, which drew at Leganes 1-1, and Alaves. Alaves visits Eibar on Sunday.\n\nMadrid remained seven points behind in sixth place after beating Valladolid 2-0 for its first win in six rounds in the home debut of interim coach Santiago Solari.\n\nBARCA FIGHTBACK\n\nSuarez opened the scoring at Vallecas Stadium when he tapped in a pass from Jordi Alba, who was played clear by a long ball from Ivan Rakitic.\n\nBut the hosts swung the match in their favor when Jose Pozo scored from outside the area and substitute Alvaro Garcia put in a ball that came off the upright.\n\nRayo was winning until the 87th when substitute Ousmane Dembele drilled in a headed back pass by defender Gerard Pique. Suarez then scored his second goal to complete the fightback when he was left unmarked to stab in Sergi Roberto's cross at the far post.\n\nVINICIUS SAVES SOLARI\n\nFor a second straight game under Solari, Madrid has turned to an 18-year-old newcomer to get a much-needed victory.\n\nMinutes after replacing Marco Asensio, Vinicius Junio showed more verve than his fellow forward by darting past a defender and unleashing a powerful shot. His strike deflected in off Valladolid defender Kiko Olivas. The league credited Vinicius with the 83rd-minute goal.\n\n\"When I received the ball, I was thinking about scoring. I counted 'one, two, three' and then struck it hard,\" Vinicius said.\n\nSergio Ramos added another goal from the penalty spot with two minutes remaining after Karim Benzema was fouled by Fernando Calero.\n\nSolari gave Vinicius his first start for Madrid on Wednesday, and the Brazil forward responded by setting up two goals to beat Melilla in the Copa del Rey. Vinicius played 12 minutes under Solari's predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, since he joined the club this summer from Flamengo.\n\nWhile some of Madrid's players were jeered by the home fans for the team's recent form, Vinicius received applause when he went on in the 73rd.\n\nSolari said he told Vinicius to \"take chances, to have a go at the defense.\"\n\nGRIEZMANN FREE KICK\n\nAntoine Griezmann scored from a free kick before Atletico conceded a late goal to draw for a third consecutive away match.\n\nLeganes equalized through Guido Carrillo with eight minutes left.\n\nAtletico has won only one of six away matches in the league.\n\n\"We know that it is at grounds like these where league titles are decided,\" Atletico midfielder Saul Niguez said. \"Leganes played a good first half, but we have to be more ambitious.\"\n\nMAD MESTALLA\n\nValencia was jeered by its fans at Mestalla Stadium, with many waving white handkerchiefs to emphasize their anger at the team's poor season, after it lost to an injury-depleted Girona 1-0.\n\nValencia, which finished fourth last season, is 14th after winning just once in 11 rounds.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He\u2019s 6-foot-11, he can shoot over anyone, he can get his shot off at any time. He\u2019s a defender. But he\u2019s such an unselfish player and he plays the game the right way.

And he\u2019s just in chill mode. He is gonna be a guy that could have averaged 35, 40 points in this league \u2013 and he\u2019s accepting winning over all. Nothing individual. It\u2019s about the team.\u201d\n\nPippen is certainly correct in saying that Durant has the potential to increase his scoring average \u2013 but the same could be said about a number of NBA superstars.

The Thunder won 134-111. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Scott Brooks knows he needs to try something to change the way things are going for his Washington Wizards. The problems are so plentiful, the coach just is not quite sure what to do.\n\nAll-Star guards John Wall and Bradley Beal lead the Wizards into their game against the visiting New York Knicks on Sunday with a 1-7 record, including 0-3 at home, and five consecutive losses overall.\n\n\"Patience is running low from everybody,\" Beal said. \"We've got to do it more collectively. The only way were going to get out of this slump is we've got to do it together.\"\n\nTheir defense already was the worst in the NBA, giving up 122.4 points per game, before allowing even more than that in a 134-111 setback against Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night.\n\n\"It just looks like nobody's on the same page. I mean, like, if one person gets beat or somebody gives up a wide-open shot, nobody is there to help that person or pick that person up. Got to all be on one string,\" Wall said. \"You can't teach effort. You can't teach heart. You've got to go out there and compete. That's just something you've got to be born with.\"\n\nThe transition defense, in particular, is absent.\n\nWashington's rebounding isn't much better.\n\nIts second unit \u2014 which Brooks often deploys without a starter to lead the way \u2014 is slumping and turned a 30-all contest against OKC into a 79-50 blowout by halftime. Turnovers have become a real issue, with Beal and Wall combining for 12 on Friday.\n\nSo how will Brooks fix all of that?\n\n\"Everything's open. We have to figure out ways to play better in all the 48 minutes that we're on the floor, whether it's going with a smaller rotation or it's playing other guys. I have to figure it out,\" he said. \"We can't just keep watching the same thing over and over and over and expect things are going to change.\"\n\nAgainst the Thunder, the Wizards led by 10 points in the first quarter, but were run off the court in the second, outscored by 24 in that period alone.\n\n\"That's where they killed us,\" Wall said. \"When we're not making shots, we don't defend at a high level.\"\n\nThe Wizards heard boos from spectators as the Thunder pulled away and piled on.\n\n\"We know the fans are getting impatient with it. Ted is probably impatient with it,\" Beal said, referring to team owner Ted Leonsis. \"So we've just got to do it.\"\n\nOtherwise, this season is on the verge of spiraling out of control.\n\nLast season, when Wall sat out 41 games because of a bad knee, Washington was the Eastern Conference's No. 8 seed and lost in the first round of the playoffs to No. 1 seed Toronto. There were questions about chemistry, defense and rebounding.\n\nTeam architect Ernie Grunfeld hoped to help those last two areas by adding center Dwight Howard. But Howard wasn't able to play in a Wizards uniform until Friday after dealing with a sore backside. And while his debut looked promising at the outset \u2014 13 of his 20 points came in the first quarter \u2014 the result was the same for the team.\n\n\"Dwight,\" Brooks noted, \"was a bright spot.\"\n\nThose have been few and far between lately for the Wizards during what their coach called \"a tough patch.\"\n\nThat might be underselling it.\n\nNo one in the NBA has a worse record.\n\n\"We can't keep looking at the negatives, negatives, negatives,\" Beal said, \"because it's just going to continue to brainwash us and kill us mentally.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: The Motley Fool)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Warren Buffett's sprawling company Berkshire Hathaway doubled its operating profit to $6.88 billion from $3.44 billion in the same quarter last year, as its core insurance division dodged catastrophic natural disasters and benefited from tax cuts.\n\nThe multinational conglomerate on Saturday reported third-quarter earnings of $18.54 billion, or $7.53 per share, up from last year's $2.47 billion, or 1.65 per share. Last year's weak profits were partly the result of an earthquake in Mexico and major hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\n\nBuffet's holdings in the insurance industry are sizable, and when hurricanes cause water damage, insurers are responsible for footing some of the bills.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, which owns BNSF railroad, the Geico insurer, and NetJets private jets, also benefited in the July to September period from improvements across its railroad, utilities and energy businesses.\n\nThe strong results gave Buffet an opportunity to repurchase $928 million of its stock, which is a rare move for Berkshire.\n\nThe last time the firm bought back shares was in the fourth quarter of 2012 when the Omaha, Nebraska-based company spent 1.2 billion to repurchase a block of stock, most of which belonged to a longtime shareholder.\n\nIn July, the company eliminated a restriction that capped its ability to buy back its own stock, allowing the legendary CEO to deploy more of the conglomerate's $108 billion of cash and equivalents.\n\nUnder the policy, stock buybacks can be performed any time that Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger believe that the repurchase price is \u201cbelow Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\u201d\n\nBerkshire Hathaway also has investments in companies such as Apple, Coca-Cola and American Express.\n\nClass A shares closed at $308,411 per share on Friday.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/03/warren-buffetts-company-berkshire-hathaway-quadruples-3-q-profit/1872297002/", "ZHUHAI, China (AP) \u2014 Ashleigh Barty rallied from a set down to beat defending champion Julia Goerges 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the semifinals of the WTA Elite Trophy on Saturday.\n\nThe Australian faces Wang Qiang, who beat Garbine Muguruza 6-2, 6-0, in Sunday's final.\n\nBarty served one more ace than her opponent \u2014 8-7 \u2014 but also had six double faults, compared to just two for Goerges.\n\nBarty won her only previous match against Wang in Strasbourg earlier this year.\n\nWang served seven aces and converted five of seven break points against the overmatched Muguruza to become the first Chinese player to reach the final of the tournament.\n\nWang was a late replacement for original group-stage winner Madison Keys after the American withdrew from the semifinal with a left knee injury.\n\nThe tournament in Zhuhai features the leading players on the women's tour who didn't qualify for the WTA Finals in Singapore last week.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic's latest victory over Roger Federer was among the toughest and best in their epic rivalry, a 7-6 (6), 5-7, 7-6 (3) feast of attacking tennis which had the roaring crowd on their feet and remained in doubt until the very end.\n\nIt finally ended, after three hours, when Djokovic moved 6-1 up in the tiebreaker. Federer saved two match points but cracked in a long rally and chopped a backhand into the net.\n\n\"We had epic matches throughout our rivalry but this one definitely ranks as one of the best,\" Djokovic said.\n\nDjokovic's fourth straight win over Federer and 25th in 47 contests sends him into the final against unseeded Russian Karen Khachanov, who has never played in a Masters final.\n\n\"This is my best match of the year, that's for sure,\" Djokovic said, addressing the crowd in French. \"Big respect to Roger.\"\n\nFederer remains one short of 100 career titles.\n\n\"When you lose a close match like this you always have regrets,\" a disappointed Federer said. \"That's why I guess I have this face right now.\"\n\nDjokovic is on a 22-match winning streak and will aim to move level with Rafael Nadal on a record 33 Masters titles.\n\n\"Novak is obviously on a roll,\" Federer said. \"You can feel it.\"\n\nKhachanov, who beat Dominic Thiem 6-4, 6-1, won the Kremlin Cup in Moscow last month for his third career title.\n\nDjokovic, who beat him on the way to the Wimbledon title, is seeking a record-extending fifth Paris Masters title and 73rd title overall.\n\nHe was made to work far harder than when he beat Federer in the Cincinnati Masters final in August.\n\nAfter they hugged at the net, Federer walked off quickly and raised a thumb to the cheering crowd.\n\n\"People enjoy the rivalry. We do as well,\" Federer said. \"It's tough and fair, the way it's supposed to be.\"\n\nFans got everything they could have hoped for: Two players with a combined 34 Grand Slam titles, 59 Masters titles, and 533 weeks at No. 1 slugging it out at a level of unrelenting yet sublime intensity.\n\nBrilliant one-handed winners on the run from Federer down the line and acute-angle volleys at the net; astonishing elasticity while retrieving from the baseline and laser-beam forehands to the corners from Djokovic.\n\nFederer had 17 aces, while Djokovic got five of his eight in his last three service games of the match, raising his level at the right time.\n\nDjokovic briefly let his volatile temper get the better of him, though, when he had Federer at 15-40 down in the ninth game of the deciding set. Federer saved both break points, and Djokovic whacked his racket into the ground, drawing the first and only boos of a titanic match.\n\nDjokovic held his hands up as if to apologize to the unforgiving crowd, unhappy that a pique of rage interrupted their gourmet feast of tennis.\n\nBrimming with confidence in a season which has seen him go from No. 22 in the rankings in May to No. 1 when they are released on Monday, and in which he also added the U.S. Open to his Grand Slam haul, Djokovic created pressure throughout.\n\nBut Federer saved every break point \u2014 12 of them \u2014 and secured the only break of the match in clinching the second set.\n\n\"Hasn't happened too many times that I don't break a serve of anyone, especially if I have 12 break points,\" Djokovic said. \"Most of the break points he just served well, and played great shots.\"\n\nThe best one of the match went to Federer in the eighth game. As Federer charged to the net, Djokovic hit a powerful forehand which clipped the net and flew to the left of Federer, wrong-footing him. From a seemingly impossible angle, and totally off balance, he scooped his racket behind his neck and flicked a volley over the net for a winner.\n\nFederer thrust his arms into the air, the crowd rose to their feet in sheer disbelief.\n\nEven by Federer's lofty standards, it was remarkable.\n\n\"That's why he is who he is,\" Djokovic said, admiringly.\n\nBut after losing the match, Federer was left shaking his head. He was unhappy with someone in the crowd twice shouting \"out\" during the long match-point rally.\n\n\"It's just unfortunate it happens and at the end you lose the point, the match,\" Federer said.\n\nStill, he retained a sense of irony.\n\n\"Thank God the rally ended,\" he said. \"It would have been five times if it continued.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They have no pass rush. They have amassed a total of 10 through eight games. Only the sorry Oakland Raiders (7) have fewer.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 pass rush still exists, though. Just in other places.\n\nDefensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, whom the Giants traded to Tampa Bay before the NFL Draft, has eight sacks. Two other outside linebackers they discarded \u2014 Devon Kennard and Romeo Okwara \u2014 have five each for the Detroit Lions.\n\nGeneral manager Dave Gettleman was applauded for getting rid of JPP and the egregious contract his predecessor, Jerry Reese, saddled the team with. The Giants committed to absorbing Pierre-Paul\u2019s $15 million dead cap charge for this season but would be rid of it come 2019.\n\nIn return the Giants received the Bucs\u2019 third-round selection (No. 69 overall) and swapped fourth-rounders (No. 102 for No. 108). With those two picks, the Giants selected defensive lineman B.J. Hill, a budding star, and Kyle Lauletta, who could end up being the team\u2019s quarterback of the future.\n\nThat was a business decision; we understand that. It may end up being a very wise one in the end. Kennard was not re-signed, and Giants fans pretty much understood why. He didn\u2019t light up the field consistently while he was here, although he flashed on occasion. Apparently the Giants weren\u2019t using him correctly. Kennard, when given the chance, was a solid pass rusher.\n\nGiants fans were stunned the team gave up on Okwara, the Notre Dame product who displayed a penchant for getting to the quarterback. He was everything they needed \u2014 young, inexpensive and productive. The Lions have him now, and he\u2019ll probably stay there for the foreseeable future. Gettleman and Shurmur messed this one up.\n\nCurrently, the Giants are led in sacks by Hill and a fellow rookie, linebacker Lorenzo Carter. They have two each. Olivier Vernon, the Giants\u2019 $85 million man, has one sack in three games played. Veteran Connor Barwin, likely playing his final NFL season, also has one.\n\nLinebacker/defensive end Kareem Martin, who the Giants signed in free agency because of his familiarity with defensive coordinator James Bettcher\u2019s scheme, leads the team with six quarterback hits but has only one sack.\n\nRelated 5 prospects the Giants should keep an eye on this Saturday\n\nBettcher\u2019s system is predicated on pressure, but the pressure that\u2019s increasing this season is the Giant fans\u2019 blood pressure.

Behind its anemic passing game, Washington isn\u2019t even mustering 21 points per game. The team is relying on monster days from 33-year-old Adrian Peterson to make the offense go. The strength of its underrated defense is stopping the run. Yet somehow, the Redskins sit atop the NFC East with an inside track to make the playoffs. The trade earlier this week for former Packers safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix gives Washington two elite safeties (D.J.

We were really lucky because we were poor, defensively awful,\" Mourinho said. \"When I say defensively, I don't just look to my defenders, I look to my team as a team.\n\n\"I felt like people watching this game don't believe the work we did on the training ground during the week. At halftime I thought I was the luckiest manager in the Premier League because ... it should have been 5-2 or 6-2 (to Bournemouth).\n\n\"I said to my players (at halftime) it was impossible to play worse than we did and the second half was going to be better for sure.\"\n\nBuoyed by what Mourinho called \"calm\" words at the interval, United was a transformed team in the second period and several times went close to scoring.\n\nBournemouth had a remarkable double escape in the 65th when Nathan Ake threw his body in the way of a shot from England striker Rashford after Young had hit the woodwork. David Brooks then hacked Paul Pogba's rebound off the line.\n\nIt proved a temporary reprieve, however, as Pogba dashed down the left two minutes into stoppage time before sending over an inviting center that Rashford chested down before beating Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.\n\n\"The second half was exactly the opposite to the first,\" Mourinho said. \"We created a lot of chances, we pressed higher, we had much more aggression, intensity and intention.\n\n\"I can't believe how bad we started. I was not at the warm-up but my assistants were telling me this is the best warm-up of our season, everybody very focused with a great intensity. I love the song 'Attack, attack, attack' but you need to know that when you lose the ball you have to have stability.\n\n\"We are not showing we have stability. We were ready for everything, we worked tactically for everything. I really can't understand the kind of mentality that brings me more white hair.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP English soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/PremierLeague and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 An Uzbek businessman who has been accused of ties to organized crime was elected president of the amateur boxing association on Saturday, putting the sport on a collision course with the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe IOC criticized Gafur Rakhimov's bid to become head of AIBA, and it has yet to confirm boxing is on the program for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The IOC has threatened to host an Olympic boxing tournament without AIBA, cutting off the financially troubled federation from a key funding source.\n\nRakhimov said AIBA can repair relations with the IOC, but didn't give details.\n\n\"We can reach an agreement with the International Olympic Committee and if we somehow don't manage to agree then we will think of something so that boxing doesn't suffer,\" he said.\n\nRakhimov beat his only challenger, former Kazakh boxer and politician Serik Konakbayev, with 86 votes out of 134 valid ballots cast.\n\nRakhimov is on a U.S. Treasury Department sanctions list for alleged links to international heroin trafficking. The sanctions bar U.S. citizens and companies from doing business with him. He has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe IOC said in a statement, \"There are issues of grave concern with AIBA regarding judging, finance, and the anti-doping programme, and with governance,\" including Rakhimov's election as president.\n\nThe IOC added AIBA will be on the agenda at the next executive board meeting in Tokyo, starting on Nov. 30, and called for \"a clear roadmap for long-term sustainable reform of the federation.\"\n\nSpeaking before the vote, Rakhimov \u2014 who served as AIBA interim president since January \u2014 sought to play down tensions with the IOC.\n\n\"Boxing will definitely be on the Tokyo Olympic Games program, and also in Paris and Los Angeles (in 2024 and 2028), just like any future Olympic Games. It's in no way linked to your choice of AIBA president,\" he said.\n\n\"If any temporary issues arise between AIBA and the IOC, linked to the election of any AIBA official, including me, in that case we know how to solve them. Boxing and the Olympic Games are inseparable.\"\n\nRakhimov had suggested he could take an extended leave of absence from AIBA to help repair IOC relations, but a proposed rule change that would allow him to do that while retaining voting rights on AIBA's board was defeated twice at the congress.\n\nDelegates struggled with an electronic voting system which, in one test, produced more votes than the official delegate count, which had to be re-taken.\n\nOrganizers eventually resorted to hastily printed paper ballots and a makeshift voting booth made of tables and sheets.\n\nThe defeated candidate, Konakbayev, said he would form an opposition grouping.\n\n\"My team is reviewing the decision as well as the election process,\" he said. \"This is not the end but the start of a movement to reform the world governing body and save boxing. We will not give up the fight. Round one is over, the bell for round two is chiming.\"\n\nThe U.S. Treasury alleged in 2012 that Rakhimov was \"one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in the countries of Central Asia,\" and involved in trafficking heroin. He is preparing a legal challenge in the U.S. to his inclusion on the list.\n\nThe sanctions do not amount to a finding of guilt, and Rakhimov's legal team contends they stem from persecution by people connected to Uzbekistan's former president, Islam Karimov, who died in 2016.\n\nRakhimov is based in Dubai after previous legal issues in his native Uzbekistan, where he was at one stage featured on a wanted list, then removed.\n\nRakhimov was a boxer in his youth before moving into business and then sports politics. In 2007, he lobbied IOC members for Russia's bid to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\n\"I can say with real certainty that Sochi would have found it hard to count on victory\" without Rakhimov persuading voters from Asia, the then-president of the Russian Olympic Committee, Leonid Tyagachev, told the Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper at the time.\n\nAs interim president, Rakhimov said he'd saved AIBA from bankruptcy. AIBA reported it was in negative equity of $19 million as of June, against less than $4 million in assets.\n\nRakhimov said on Friday he convinced AIBA's creditors to \"waive\" much of its debt, but didn't say how.\n\nThe IOC has suspended payments to AIBA and did not let Rakhimov attend the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires last month. British authorities previously blocked his accreditation request for the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nRakhimov also could not attend the 2000 Sydney Olympics when Australia's government denied him a visa despite being accredited for the games.\n\nAIBA was plunged into financial instability during the 11-year reign of former president C.K. Wu, who had ambitious plans to expand into professional boxing.\n\nWu was ousted last year and the AIBA executive board has sought to ban him for life over what it called \"gross negligence and financial mismanagement.\"\n\nWu has denied wrongdoing.\n\nBesides Rakhimov's leadership, the IOC has also objected to the frequent disputes over judging at the 2016 Olympics. That prompted a profane tirade from Irish fighter Michael Conlan, who accused AIBA and Russia of corruption after losing a quarterfinal to a Russian opponent.\n\nOn doping, AIBA executive director Tom Virgets said on Friday it resolved 38 long-running cases this year, but the verdicts were secret.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Reigning national champion Villanova also should get a boost from a transfer.\n\nPerhaps the most notable example is No. 1 Kansas , which added Dedric Lawson and K.J. Lawson from Memphis and also brought in former California guard Charlie Moore. All three players sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules.\n\nBig 12 coaches have selected Dedric Lawson as the conference's preseason newcomer of the year.\n\n\"The thing that separates him from most is his ability to see the game differently than the way most people see it,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said. \"He doesn't see one pass ahead, he sees two. He is the best passer we've had since I've been the coach at Kansas.\"\n\nNo. 2 Kentucky has Stanford graduate transfer Reid Travis . No. 3 Gonzaga has added Geno Crandall from North Dakota and Brandon Clarke from San Jose State. No. 5 Virginia expects a boost from former Alabama guard Braxton Key. Villanova , ranked ninth, should get some instant offense from Albany graduate transfer Joe Cremo.\n\nHere's a closer look at some transfers who figure to make a major impact on the 2018-19 college basketball season.\n\nF BRANDON CLARKE and G GENO CRANDALL, GONZAGA\n\nHeight/Class: Clarke: 6-foot-8/Jr. Crandall: 6-3/Sr.\n\nFormer schools: Clarke: San Jose State. Crandall: North Dakota.\n\nCrandall is a graduate transfer who earned second-team all-Big Sky honors for North Dakota each of the last two seasons. Clarke joins Gonzaga's team this year after sitting out the 2017-18 season. Crandall averaged 15.5 points as a sophomore and 16.6 points as a junior. He also led the Big Sky in steals (2.1) and ranked seventh in assists (3.6) last season. Clarke averaged 17.3 points, 8.7 rebounds, 2.6 blocks and 2.3 assists to earn first-team all-Mountain West honors for San Jose State in 2016-17. Clarke had 18 points and 11 rebounds in just 16 minutes as Gonzaga defeated Central Washington in a preseason exhibition. Crandall had 8 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals in that game.\n\nG JOE CREMO, VILLANOVA\n\nHeight/Class: 6-4/Sr.\n\nFormer school: Albany\n\nVillanova loses four NBA draft picks from last season's national championship team but adds some firepower by luring this graduate transfer from Albany. Cremo scored 1,469 points in three seasons at Albany and was a first-team all-America East selection last year. He averaged 17.8 points and shot 45.8 percent from 3-point range (76 of 166) in his junior season to help Albany go 22-10. He averaged 15.8 points as a sophomore.\n\nG MUSTAPHA HERON, ST.

He missed a preseason exhibition Thursday due to a concussion. Heron helped Auburn win a share of the Southeastern Conference regular-season title last year as he averaged 16.4 points and 5.3 rebounds while earning second-team Associated Press all-SEC honors . He ranked sixth in the SEC in scoring. Heron had 15.2 points and 6.1 rebounds per game as a freshman.\n\nG BRAXTON KEY, VIRGINIA\n\nHeight/Class: 6-8/Jr.\n\nFormer school: Alabama\n\nKey received a waiver from the NCAA that allows the Alabama transfer to play for Virginia immediately rather than sitting out a season. Key led Alabama with 12 points per game and also averaged 5.7 rebounds and 2.5 assists as a freshman in 2016-17 before his production dipped last year. Key had 7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game in 2017-18 after a knee injury caused him to miss the first 10 games of the season.\n\nF DEDRIC LAWSON, G K.J.

USA TODAY\n\nGreen Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews (52) looks across the line before the snap against the Los Angeles Rams during the first quarter at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. (Photo: Jake Roth, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTwo days after nearly handing the Los Angeles Rams their first loss of the season, the Green Bay Packers surprised many by sending Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to the Washington Redskins.\n\nTrading away a starting safety and former Pro Bowl selection came across as an odd move for an aspiring contender. While general manager Brian Gutekunst said the franchise wasn't giving up on this campaign by parting with Clinton-Dix, the transaction left many wondering about the team's viability for the second half of the season.\n\nHow the Packers' surging fifth-ranked pass defense (221.7 yards per game allowed) handles its responsibilities in a rare showdown between Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady will go a long way toward answering those lingering concerns.\n\nThe architect of that effort will be defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, a man accustomed to squaring off against Brady and Bill Belichick given his experience serving in the same position for both the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills. While his aggressive units have given the Patriots passer trouble at times, Brady has come out victorious in eight of their 11 meetings (including the playoffs).\n\nMidseason report: Winners and losers at halfway mark of season\n\nBlitzing Brady has historically been a dicey proposition, as the three-time MVP has repeatedly made defenses pay for trying to generate pressure with extra rushers. That could necessitate a shift in tactics for Pettine after his defense racked up five sacks and eight quarterback hits on the Rams' Jared Goff last week thanks to his frequent overload blitzes.\n\nInterior disruptors Mike Daniels and Kenny Clark, who had two sacks against Los Angeles, might be even more important than Clay Matthews and the rest of the edge rushers, as they will be counted on to provide a push and force Brady off his spot. New England could be especially vulnerable up front with guard Shaq Mason out.\n\nThe secondary, however, will also have to hold its coverage to help the pass rush out and prevent the easy gains that Brady is routinely ready to take. Perhaps the most crucial figure for the Packers will be rookie Jaire Alexander, who had five pass breakups last week and could be tasked with containing Julian Edelman. Cornerback Tramon Williams, meanwhile, has been moved to safety and looks to get the first crack at replacing Clinton-Dix as he takes on the responsibility of handling Rob Gronkowski.\n\nHere are four other matchups that will define Week 9 in the NFL:\n\nRams OT Rob Havenstein vs. Saints DE Cam Jordan\n\nOn an explosive roster dotted with stars, Havenstein might be one of the most overlooked factors in the Rams' 8-0 start. After agreeing to a four-year, $32.5 million extension in April, he has stepped up his play this season and stands as Pro Football Focus' fifth-ranked offensive tackle through the first half of the season. His biggest value has been creating openings for NFL leading rusher Todd Gurley, though his solid pass has also been solid.\n\nJordan, however, is one of the league's best run stoppers off the edge and has generated consistent pressure on opposing quarterbacks this season. His ability to disrupt a game should come as no surprise to the Rams, against whom he recorded two sacks last year. If Havenstein can't stave him off, Jordan could again create havoc for both Gurley and Goff. But if Los Angeles can provide proper protection, its aerial attack could make explosive strikes on the league's 28th-ranked pass defense.\n\nSteelers WR Antonio Brown vs. Ravens CB Jimmy Smith\n\nPlenty has changed for both Baltimore and Pittsburgh since the Ravens' 26-14 win in the teams' first meeting this season just five weeks ago. Brown and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger were still out of sync at that point, and the four-time all-pro pass catcher recorded a relatively tame five receptions for 62 yards and a touchdown. In the Steelers' subsequent three-game win streak, however, he has notched 280 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nBaltimore, meanwhile, has dropped three of its four games since that win and now is at risk of fading out of contention in the AFC North. Stopping Brown will again be the highest priority, but the Ravens might not be able to ask Marlon Humphrey to shadow the receiver for a second time given that the cornerback missed the last two weeks with a thigh injury and is listed as questionable.\n\nThe Ravens historically have fared well with Smith matched up against Brown, winning five of the seven regular-season matchups and holding the receiver to an average of 60 yards per game in those contests. But Smith been beaten on several big plays since his return and can't afford similar slip-ups this week.\n\nChargers RBs Melvin Gordon vs. Seahawks LB Bobby Wagner\n\nGordon is listed as questionable with a hamstring injury, and his status could be a crucial factor if the game is close late. Since Week 11 of last season, the Chargers are 11-0 when they have had a fourth-quarter lead. Gordon is a key figure in Los Angeles developing a finishing touch, as he is averaging 8 yards per carry in the fourth quarter this season. When he missed a Week 7 contest against the Titans, the Chargers managed just 47 yards on 16 carries and were held to their lowest scoring output (20 points) of the season.\n\nDefensive tackle Jarran Reed and linebacker K.J. Wright are among the contributors who will try to keep the Chargers' ground game contained. But the Seahawks' defense runs through Wagner, who helped limit emerging Lions rookie running back Kerryon Johnson to 22 yards on eight carries last week.\n\nMore:Cooper's debut has Cowboys expecting quick impact\n\nCowboys WR Amari Cooper vs. Titans' secondary\n\nOn Monday night, no one in AT&T Stadium will be losing track of Cooper, the newly acquired top target for Dak Prescott. Offensive coordinator Scott Linehan has outlined a significant workload for the former Raiders pass catcher, saying \"we're not really easing him in.\" Even if Cooper doesn't immediately establish a consistent connection with Prescott, his presence could open up more opportunities for slot receiver Cole Beasley and running back Ezekiel Elliott, who was held to a season-low 34 yards on 15 carries against the Redskins in Week 7.\n\nTennessee's defense, meanwhile, is looking to get its house in order after giving up scoring strikes of 55 and 75 yards against the Chargers in London. The Titans rank ninth against the pass and have are tied for the fewest passing touchdowns allowed nine, but cornerback Malcolm Butler has been a significant letdown in the first season of a five-year, $61.25 million contract.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "", "", "CLOSE Facebook is taking on another battle prior to the upcoming midterm elections, fighting false voter information. Veuer's Natasha Abellard has the story. Buzz60\n\nExamples of Facebook posts that originated in Iran (Photo: Facebook)\n\nAs voters cast their ballots in the midterm elections, social media companies have an additional concern: protecting that process.\n\nAfter reports of fake accounts and false news stories infiltrating social networks during the 2016 presidential election, companies like Facebook and Twitter have doubled down on efforts to prevent election manipulation.\n\nAt stake is not only the validity of information found on their platforms, but also the trust of their users.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\u2019s Digital Trust Report 2018, released in August, reported that more than 75 percent of respondents said Facebook was \u201cextremely likely\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to show them deceptive content like \u201cfake news, scams or click bait.\u201d Twitter didn\u2019t do much better, with more than 60 percent of respondents agreeing the platform has deceptive content.\n\nIn January 2017, reports emerged that foreign entities like the Russia-based Internet Research Agency used social media platforms to spread false and divisive information throughout the 2016 campaign. By September 2017, Facebook announced it had linked over 3,000 political ads run on its platform between 2015 to 2017 to Russia. Facebook later said over 10 million users had been exposed to the ads.\n\nThis past September, Facebook and Twitter executives testified before Congress about accusations that foreign operatives' use of their platforms could have affected the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nSpokesmen for both Facebook and Twitter said in the aftermath of 2016 election, the companies have ramped up efforts to identify and remove fake accounts and protect users from false information.\n\nYoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, said the company has cracked down on \"coordinated platform manipulation,\" or people and organizations using Twitter to mislead other users and spread false information.\n\nMore: Twitter, Lyft, Bumble and Tinder: How tech and social media companies may change the election this year\n\nMore: Twitter sheds more users amid purge, but revenue and profit surpass expectations\n\nMore: 'Fake social,' 'fake search' are the new 'fake news' as Trump attacks tech ahead of midterms\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, misinformation appeared online in the form of fake accounts and online publications that spread hyper-partisan views, among others. Leading up to the November midterms, experts say the techniques are similar but the people spreading misinformation have gotten smarter.\n\nThe social networks have, too.\n\n\"We haven\u2019t seen a fundamental shift in what (the bad actors) are doing. But in 2016 it was like breaking into a house with the door wide open, and now there\u2019s at least a dog inside that's going to bark,\" said Bret Schafer, a social media analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan national security advocacy group.\n\nSchafer said social networks' efforts to protect their platforms and users have created a \"layer of friction\" that makes it more challenging to carry out misinformation campaigns. Efforts include cracking down on \u201cbad actors\u201d who use fake accounts to spread misinformation and requiring political advertisers to verify their identity by providing a legitimate mailing address.\n\nFacebook has developed a multifaceted approach to elections integrity. The company has nearly doubled its security team ahead of the 2018 midterms, and is taking a more proactive role in identifying \"coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" according to spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine Barr.\n\n\"We now have more than 20,000 people working on safety and security, we have put in place advanced systems and tools to detect and stop threats, and developed backstops ... to help address any unanticipated threats as quickly as possible,\" Hoffine Barr said.\n\nMany of the company's efforts begin with detecting and removing false accounts. In May, Facebook said it disabled nearly 1.3 billion fake accounts in the first half of 2018. As those accounts are often the source of false information on the site, Facebook said it's combating the spread of false news by removing them.\n\nFacebook also announced in October that it had removed 559 pages and 251 accounts for breaking the platform's rules for \"spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" which includes creating large networks of accounts to mislead other users. On Facebook, that can look like people or organizations creating false pages or fake accounts.\n\nMore: Facebook aim to fight election manipulation misses a big problem, critics say\n\nMore: We read every one of the 3,517 Facebook ads bought by Russians. Here's what we found\n\nHoffine Barr described Facebook's work as \" continuous effort,\" and noted that the company isn't working in isolation.\n\n\"Ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, we are working closely with federal and state elections officials, as well as other technology companies, to coordinate our efforts and share information,\" she said.\n\nTwo weeks before the midterms, Facebook uncovered a disinformation campaign from Iran that attempted to sow discord over hot-button issues like President Donald Trump and immigration. There's currently no evidence the campaign was tied to the Iranian government.\n\nTwitter has also taken action against bad actors, recently purging accounts the company had previously locked for \"suspicious changes in behavior.\" In an Oct. 1 blog post, Twitter executives detailed three \"critical\" areas of its efforts to preserve election integrity.\n\nThe first, an update to Twitter's rules, includes expanding what Twvitter considers a fake account. The company currently uses a number of criteria to make that determination, including whether the profile uses stolen or copied photos and provides intentionally misleading profile information. The second category is described as \"detection and protection,\" and entails identifying and spam accounts, as well as improving Twitter's ability to ban users who violate its policies.\n\nThe most visible efforts fall under \"product developments.\" From giving users control over the order of their timelines to adding an elections label for candidates' accounts, this category is all about helping Twitter's users stay informed.\n\nRoth said the company is also sharing information on \"potential state-backed operations\" with researchers to learn more about attacks on election integrity.\n\n\"Our goal is to try and stay one step ahead in the face of new challenges going forward,\" Roth said. \"Protecting the public conversation is our core mission.\"\n\nBecause these efforts by social networking companies are fairly new, it can be hard to gauge their effect. Facebook is highlighting a recent study from Stanford University and New York University, in which researchers found user interactions with fake news sites declined by more than half on Facebook after the 2016 election.\n\nSchafer said one of the big differences from 2016 is the decline in automated activity. He said Twitter in particular has gotten \"significantly more aggressive\" about shutting down bots.\n\nStill, he said social networks are in a \"tricky situation\" when it comes to regulating content. Too much regulation and they are criticized for suppressing viewpoints. Too little and their own platform rules aren't enforced.\n\n\"Unless we want to get them into the space of actively regulating content and making judgment decisions on what is and what is not factually accurate, you need to accept there\u2019s a certain amount of 'bad activity' that\u2019s going to happen on the platform,\" Schafer said.\n\nAnd while those companies are cracking down on purveyors of misinformation, others are emphasizing tools to help users distinguish fact from fiction.\n\nOn Oct. 2, New York-based tech startup Our.News has launched a Google Chrome and Firefox browser extension called Newstrition that provides users background information on media publishers for any given article, as well as third-party fact checking.\n\nThe tool was developed in conjunction with the Newseum and the Freedom Forum Institute, both nonprofits dedicated to preserving the First Amendment.\n\nMore: Donald Trump calls for more civility as he attacks media and Democrats at Charlotte rally\n\nUnlike traditional fact-checking tools that label articles as true or false, Our.News CEO Richard Zack said the Newstrition tool lets people look at validated background information for any given article and make that determination themselves.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we found as we did research and talked to people ... is that the public feels like they\u2019re not part of the (news) process,\u201d Zack said. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019re not being heard in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nNewstrition also invites users to give their opinion on news articles through a public ratings system. Much like Amazon or Yelp! reviews, individual responses are then aggregated to show the \u201cpublic consensus,\u201d Zack said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually saying, \u2018We want to hear your thoughts. We want to know what you think. You are a part of the process,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe extension has already received thousands of downloads, as well as attention from media companies. Zack said although Our.News is not at liberty to discuss specifics, the company is talking with several major news publishers about integrating the tool on their websites.\n\n\u201cIf people can\u2019t figure out what to believe, then that undermines the entire First Amendment,\u201d Zack said. \u201cIt undermines the freedom of the press as an institution.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, social networks and experts say one thing is clear: this is far from the end of misinformation campaigns. Schafer said that although the issue is especially timely during an election year, those efforts are going on behind the scenes every day.\n\n\"It's not as if these accounts somehow appear before elections and then they go back into hibernation and they'll come back in 2020,\" he said. \"They're going to work every single day, chipping away at people's trust in democracies or democratic institutions or just further inflaming partisan debates.\"\n\nMore: These are the liberal memes Iran used to target Americans on Facebook\n\nMore: Facebook foils political influence campaigns originating in Iran, Russia ahead of U.S. midterms\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/03/facebook-twitter-elections-interference/1806308002/", "Wandering the ruins of Hadrian's Wall is a highlight of any visit to northern England. (Photo: Dominic Arizona Bonuccelli)\n\nI'm so glad borders and walls are out of fashion in Europe. The continent's many proud nations don't always get along, but they have learned to respect each other \u2013 making it possible for peace to flourish.\n\nHistorically, though, Europe has a rich past when it comes to wall building. At one point or another, most of Europe's great cities \u2013 Paris, London, Rome, Florence, Milan, Barcelona, Vienna and many more \u2013 were all contained within walls, constructed during ancient and medieval times to defend against invaders. Most of these walls were torn down long ago to allow cities to expand beyond their historic centers. But some remain intact and well-preserved; in places like Dubrovnik (Croatia), Rothenburg (Germany) and Carcassonne (France), visitors can actually stroll atop these city walls.\n\nMore: Rick Steves: Europe's great walled towns\n\nOne of my favorite ancient wall experiences is Hadrian's Wall, the remains of the fortification built by the Romans occupying Britain nearly 2,000 years ago. This great stone wall stretched 73 miles from coast to coast across the narrowest part of northern England, where Britannia stopped and the barbarian land that would someday be Scotland began.\n\nMore than just a simple barrier, Hadrian's Wall was a cleverly designed military rampart manned by 20,000 troops. At every mile there was a small fort guarding a gate. In recent decades, two of these forts have been turned into museums, where visitors can see the ruins up close, view ancient artifacts and get a sense of life in this distant corner of Europe. Pondering these desolate ruins, you can imagine the bleakness of being a young Roman soldier stationed here centuries ago.\n\nHadrian's Wall is also much loved by hikers, who enjoy following the wall as it meanders up and down the natural contours of the land. For years, I never ventured beyond the museums and car-park viewpoints. But on a recent visit, I finally had time on a sunny late afternoon to hike the wall. Scrambling along Roman ruins, all alone with the sound of the wind, I took a moment to just absorb the setting \u2013 surveying vast expanses from rocky crags that seemed to rip across the island like a snapshot freezing some horrific geological violence in mid-action.\n\nWhile a visit to Hadrian's Wall is intriguing, for me, the most poignant and memorable wall experiences are those from Europe's recent past. These walls \u2013 once produced out of fear and intolerance, now symbolize peace and progress.\n\nFor example, during the Troubles \u2013 the 30-year conflict that wracked Northern Ireland \u2013 so-called \"peace walls\" went up all over Belfast to separate the two sectarian communities \u2013 Catholic Nationalists and Protestant Unionists. But now, instead of helping to keep the peace by segregating the two groups, these walls offer a place for visitors to leave messages of hope.\n\nLike the peace walls in Belfast, the Lennon Wall in Prague is slathered in graffiti and ideas about peace, love and freedom. Back in Cold War times, when the Czech people were like birds locked in a cage, John Lennon and the Beatles' song lyrics gave them hope and vision. When Lennon was killed in 1980, this large wall near the Charles Bridge was spontaneously covered with memorial graffiti. Night after night, the police would paint over the \"All You Need Is Love\" and \"Imagine\" graffiti. And day after day, it would reappear. Today the wall remains a colorful and nostalgic place to visit.\n\nA few stretches of the Berlin Wall still stand, such as in the Mauerpark, where artists continue to leave their mark. (Photo: Rick Steves)\n\nOf course, the most famous wall from Cold War times is the 96-mile-long barrier that was built in 1961, encircling West Berlin and making it an island of freedom in communist East Germany. While most of the Wall was torn down decades ago, remnants remain, including at the Berlin Wall Memorial, where a long stretch has been preserved as a memorial to the victims of the Cold War.\n\nMore: Rick Steves: Visiting Europe\u2019s 20th-century fascist sites\n\nThe memorial features two museums and a long, narrow park that runs for nearly a mile alongside the most complete surviving stretch of the wall. The park is dotted with memorials and information displays, and occupies what was once the notorious \"death strip\" \u2013 the no-man's-land between East and West where an obstacle course of barbed wire, tire-spike strips and other devices was designed to stop would-be escapees.\n\nThe memorial ends at the Mauerpark (Mauer is German for \"wall\"). Standing on a ridge next to a fragment of the Wall on a recent sunny Sunday, I survey the scene. The death strip now hosts the world's biggest karaoke party, kids run around the playground \u2013 and the Wall is now a canvas for spray-painters.\n\nI've seen a lot of walls in my travels, and they're always a thought-provoking experience. They're also a hopeful reminder that while struggles remain, Europe has tackled differences \u2013 by tearing down walls and instead building bridges between its diverse citizens.\n\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

Here's what you need to know. USA TODAY\n\nDaylight Saving Time was introduced so during World War One as a way of conserving fuel needed for war industries and of extending the working day so people could use less energy. The resulting sleep disturbance, however, can take a toll on your body and wreak havoc on your internal clock. Opinions are mixed when it comes to the time changes twice a year, as well as the potential impact on public health. In fact, Arizona (except the Navajo region), Hawaii and the overseas territories of the United States don\u2019t observe DST, and some states have petitioned to permanently end it. Reasons cited vary from getting more sun, to altered sleep patterns and increased road accidents. Experts point to several possible causes for the troubles, including trouble adjusting to the sudden sunset time change. To compile the following list of health effects DST may have on a person\u2019s health, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed over a dozen studies and consulted a sleep expert.

But hospital software still can\u2019t handle daylight saving time.\n\nEpic Systems, one of the most popular electronic health records software systems used by hospitals, can delete records or require cumbersome workarounds when clocks are set back for an hour \u2013 prompting many hospitals to opt for paper records for part of the night shift.\n\nAnd it happens every year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling,\u201d said Dr. Mark Friedberg, a senior physician policy researcher at RAND. In 2018, he said, \u201cwe expect electronics to handle something as simple as a time change.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody is surprised by daylight saving time. They have years to prep. Only, surprise, it hasn\u2019t been fixed.\u201d\n\nDr. Steven Stack, a past president of the American Medical Association, called the glitches \u201cperplexing\u201d and \u201cunacceptable,\u201d considering that hospitals spend millions of dollars on these systems, and Apple and Google seem to have dealt with seasonal time changes long ago.\n\nEpic was founded in 1979. But some hospitals have used the electronic systems longer than others.\n\nCarol Hawthorne-Johnson, an intensive-care-unit nurse in California, said her hospital doesn\u2019t shut down the Epic system during the fall time change. But she\u2019s come to expect that the vital signs she enters into the system from 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday will be deleted when the clock falls back to 1 a.m. One hour\u2019s worth of electronic record-keeping \u201cis gone,\u201d she said.\n\nHospital staff have learned to deal with it by taking extra chart notes by hand. But it\u2019s still a burden, Hawthorne-Johnson said, especially if vitals change, or a patient needs, say, a blood transfusion.\n\nHospitals often avoid the software glitches by turning the software off and switching to paper charts. But it\u2019s far from ideal, because hospitals have evolved to become increasingly reliant on electronic systems, said Stack, an emergency physician in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cWhen (electronic medical records) work, it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said. But when the system is turned off, doctors can\u2019t use it to access patient records or order tests. Whiteboards are a thing of the past, and some staff members aren\u2019t comfortable with paper records after relying on electronic records their entire careers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an hour where you\u2019re flying sort of blind,\u201d Friedberg said.\n\nMore: How Daylight Saving affects your sleep and overall health\n\nMore: The Dept. of Transportation is in charge of time and 11 other things you didn't know about daylight saving time\n\nThe one-hour pause slows everything down, which can cause patients to spend more time in emergency department waiting rooms. Some go home before seeing a health care provider. That\u2019s dangerous, Stack said.\n\nNot all hospitals turn Epic off. At the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, providers who need to check patients periodically through the night use a workaround: They enter vitals at 1 a.m. and then when the clock falls back an hour later and they have to enter new vitals, they list them at 1:01 a.m. They leave a note that it\u2019s an hour later, not a minute later. That\u2019s how the Cleveland Clinic does it, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with the sentiment that we would like health IT systems to be much more sophisticated,\u201d said Dr. Peter Greene, chief medical information officer at Hopkins. But there are plenty of other problems he\u2019d like to see fixed first.\n\n\u201cThis particular aspect is not one that has caused us a lot of trouble,\u201d he said.\n\nOther electronic medical records systems may require similar workarounds, said Jennifer Carpenter, vice president of IT clinical systems at University Hospitals in Cleveland. University Hospitals uses several electronic medical records systems.\n\nMany hospitals use Cerner, another major electronic medical records company. Those hospitals plan for Cerner to be down during the time change, too.\n\nCerner was unavailable to comment. A spokeswoman for Epic, asked to comment on the glitches and workarounds, provided a statement.\n\n\u201cDaylight saving time is inherently nuanced for health care organizations, which is why we work closely with customers to provide guidance on how to most effectively use their system to care for their patients during this time period,\u201d Epic spokeswoman Meghan Roh said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly making improvements and looking for opportunities to enhance the system.\u201d\n\nFriedberg said hospitals are often locked into their electronic medical record systems because they\u2019ve invested so much money in them. It would cost even more to convert and transfer the records into a new system. As a result, he said, there\u2019s little incentive for software companies to improve their products.\n\n\u201cI shudder to think,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does it do with leap years?\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

One of the most complicated blazes the fire department ever tackled, it exceeded 2,000 degrees and destroyed or damaged more than 1 million books.\n\nSusan Orlean turns this into a whodunit, focusing on the search for an arson suspect. After the fire, the city posted requests for clues on billboards and on radio ads. The library staff worried that it might be a disgruntled employee. But librarians remembered a blond young man who was shooed out of the closed history stacks.\n\nIt would eventually lead investigators to focus on a troubled, rootless, name-dropping would-be actor. The suspect, Harry Peak, suffered from an inability to keep his alibi straight. Case closed? Not quite.

He used his legs to buy time and beat the Buffaloes with his arm this time, completing 17 of 22 passes, including a pair of touchdowns to Shawn Poindexter.\n\n\"Our offense, we haven't been as good the past few games and we knew we had to step up,\" Tate said. \"The defense has been doing what they're doing and we knew we needed to improve.\"\n\nJ.J.

Arizona also had a pair of miscues on special teams and K.D.

(Martti Kainulainen/Lehtikuva via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAleksander Barkov is quick to point out the NHL is so popular in Finland that tickets to two games in Helsinki sold out in less than five minutes.\n\n\"It shows how much they love the game,\" the Florida Panthers captain said. \"There's good reason to do that every year.\"\n\nThe NHL is planning just that after Commissioner Gary Bettman announced initial plans for a 2019 season-opener in Prague, two regular-season games in Stockholm and exhibitions in Germany and Switzerland. The Panthers and Winnipeg Jets played the 24th and 25th regular-season games outside North America on Thursday and Friday at a packed Hartwall Arena in the Finnish capital.\n\nAs the league sows seeds of interest in new markets like China, it is also continuing to cultivate interest in established hockey countries like Sweden, Finland and the Czech Republic. And there's a modest proposal for continuing to stoke the interest in the sport in Scandinavia and across Europe.\n\n\"One thing that I know former players have been talking about is maybe more games earlier on the weekends so they can actually watch,\" said Washington Capitals center Nicklas Backstrom, who is Swedish. \"Prime time here is middle of the night there. To make it more popular in Europe and Sweden, I think more games in the middle of the day on the weekends would be great. That's how you can get it more popular.\"\n\nA crowded sports calendar in the U.S. with the NFL and college football going on during the first half of the season makes that a challenge. Not counting the three games this season taking place in Europe, just 127 regular-season NHL games \u2014 roughly 10 percent of the full schedule \u2014 start early enough in North America that fans in places in Western and Central Europe can watch before a late evening bedtime.\n\nEven with games on Thursday, Sunday and Monday nights to fill prime-time spots in the U.S., traditional Sunday afternoon kickoffs have helped the NFL become bigger in Europe. Games at Wembley Stadium in London feature fans in jerseys of just about every team, not just the two playing, and the influence goes beyond England.\n\n\"In Denmark, the NFL (became) quite popular like 10, 15 years ago because they started games in the afternoon, so people could start watching at dinner time and they could just keep watching a new game,\" Capitals center Lars Eller said. \"I would welcome more afternoon games.\"\n\nThe \"NHL on NBC\" games that start at 12:30 p.m. Eastern on Sunday largely after the American football season ends fit that bill. And with more teams choosing to skip morning skates altogether, afternoon starts wouldn't throw off game-day routines to the point that there's pushback from players.\n\n\"Whenever that happens, games at 12 or 1 p.m. Eastern time, it's like 7 o'clock in Finland or (nighttime) in Europe, so people can see,\" Barkov said. \"Of course there's a big audience there.\"\n\nBettman said he is not sure hockey can grow more in places like Sweden and Finland where there are already strong domestic leagues and a steady flow of talented players reaching the NHL.\n\n\"What we need to do is continue to work to keep it at the extraordinarily high level that it's at,\" he said.\n\nBettman and Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly brushed aside the idea of basing an NHL team in Europe, saying it would need to be a group of teams and that no one has come up with a viable plan. They said staging an outdoor game in Europe is a possibility but not something likely to happen soon.\n\nMore likely is a regular schedule of \"Global Series\" games across Europe.

And he's been all of that,\" he said.\n\nPetterson's second goal of the night tied the score with 36 seconds remaining in regulation \u2014 the game's sixth tie \u2014 just 1:01 after Nathan MacKinnon second of the game gave the Avalanche a 6-5 lead.\n\n\"I got goosebumps when we tied the game late,\" Pettersson said.\n\nPouliot then took a pass from Pouliot on the right side of the goal and sent a shot that hit the crossbar and deflected off defenseman Gabriel Bourque and in with 22 seconds left on the clock in overtime.\n\nBoeser scored twice, and Loui Eriksson and Markus Granlund had the other goals for Vancouver in a game neither team lead by more than one goal. Jacob Markstrom stopped 23 shots.\n\nSheldon Dries, Ian Cole, Alexander Kerfoot and Nikita Zadorov also scored for Colorado, and NHL points leader Mikko Rantanen had three assists. Philipp Grubauer finished with 30 saves.\n\nThe Avalanche completed an 0-2-1 road trip, losing each game by one goal \u2014 including a 6-5 defeat at Calgary on Thursday night after giving up a 4-1 lead.\n\n\"It's been a weird seven periods,\" Grubauer said. \"It wasn't the best road trip, to be sure. We'll need to keep working, if we're smart as a team we'll learn from this road trip, learn from our mistakes.\"\n\nGreen had no complaints after the Canucks' third straight win.\n\n\"Wow. What a night. Seems like a lot of ups and downs. That was a fun game to coach,\" he said. \"That was a hell of a win.\"\n\nZadorov gave Colorado a 5-4 lead 1:30 into the third period with first of the season.\n\nGranlund responded for the Canucks on a power play just past the midpoint of the period. Vancouver right wing Nikolay Goldobin struggled to hang on to the puck in front of the net, but found a way to dish it to Granlund, who popped it in past Grubauer.\n\nThe teams combined for seven goals in the second period, with Dries starting the flurry 1:38 in as he redirected a shot from Kerfoot into the net to tie the score 1-1.\n\nBoeser got his second of the night at 5:18 on that nifty pass from Pettersson to put Vancouver back ahead.

(AP) \u2014 Facing a Carolina Hurricanes team that leads the league in shots per game, the Arizona Coyotes needed every one of goalie Antti Raanta's career high 48 saves. They also needed overtime after giving up a three-goal lead.\n\nMichael Grabner scored 1:17 into the extra period to lift the Coyotes to their fifth straight win, 4-3 over the Hurricanes on Friday night.\n\nGrabner credited his goalie after the victory.\n\n\"He's been playing great all year.

(AP Photo/Alex Goodlett) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Mike Conley is finally starting to feel like himself again.\n\nConley, who missed most of last season with a heel injury and just began practicing full speed in September, scored a season-high 28 points to lead the Memphis Grizzlies over the short-handed Utah Jazz 110-100 on Friday night.\n\n\"Some timing is still off a bit with the shot and the legs and getting the body back together, but tonight's game as opposed to the first time we played them is night and day,\" Conley said.\n\nAiding his return has been the steady presence of teammate Marc Gasol.\n\n\"We've played together so much and we just play the game the right way,\" Conley said. \"It's easy to come back when you have a guy like that who knows where you need the ball and gets the best opportunity for your team to score.\"\n\nConley and Gasol, who had 17 points, orchestrated a motion offense with deft passing that kept the Jazz guessing and out of position as the Grizzlies shot 51 percent to win their third straight game.\n\n\"Once you make shots, everything gets easier. But we played unselfish, exploiting that pick-and-roll and mixing rolls with pops,\" said Gasol, who added 10 rebounds and seven assists, often initiating from the high post.\n\nUtah played without star guard Donovan Mitchell, the team's leading scorer. He sat out with a right hamstring strain.\n\nThe Jazz missed their creative star on offense, and Conley said: \"It definitely helped that Donovan didn't play.\"\n\nBut the team pinned this loss on failing to stop the Grizzlies.\n\n\"Our group has to stake its claim on the defensive end,\" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. \"No matter who's out there, that's something that we can control. ... The defensive end is where we have to put our focus.\"\n\nRicky Rubio paced the Jazz with 22 points, and Jae Crowder scored 12 of his 18 in the fourth quarter. But he couldn't draw Utah closer than seven after Memphis' big run at the beginning of the period.\n\n\"I found my shot. I knew Donovan was out, so I had to be a little more aggressive in looking for my shot. It worked in the beginning,\" Rubio said.\n\nThe Jazz led by 12 in the first half but the Grizzlies used a 30-18 third quarter to move in front.\n\nJoe Ingles, who had 19 points and became the seventh Jazz player with 500 3-pointers, sank a 3 on Utah's first possession of the fourth to get within two. But the Grizzlies scored 11 consecutive points, including back-to-back 3s by Gasol and MarShon Brooks.\n\nShelvin Mack, who played for Utah from 2015-17, had 19 points \u2014 the most he's scored since he was with the Jazz.\n\n\"When the shots are there I've got to take them,\" Mack said. \"Mike's able to drive and make plays for me.\"\n\nUtah has dropped all three home games this season, including a 92-84 loss to Memphis just 10 days ago. The last time the Jazz started 0-3 at home was Ty Corbin's final season as coach in 2013-14.\n\nDRAWING RUDY FROM THE RIM\n\nSeveral times, the Grizzlies forced Utah's switching defense into uncomfortable matchups. \"We did a good job of taking advantage of their switches,\" Conley said. \"They're a very long team, especially with Rudy Gobert down there. When we got him out there guarding a guard, we got penetration and kick-out and that opened up the paint.\"\n\nTHE TWO-MAN GAME\n\nGasol said it took all of \"22 seconds\" to feel comfortable with Conley in their first pickup game together this fall. \"We read basketball the same way. He sees the same angles that I see.

New York outscored Dallas 33-18 in the third quarter after trailing by three at halftime, and led by as many as 17 in the fourth, when Trier scored 14 .\n\nDennis Smith Jr. scored 23 points and 19-year-old rookie Luka Doncic had 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the Mavericks, who matched their longest losing streak from the lost 2017-18 season.\n\nThat six-game skid a year ago led to a 2-14 start and 24-58 finish, and this slump followed a 2-1 start that marked Dallas' first winning record since the end of the 2015-16 season. The Mavericks opened 2-13 two seasons ago.\n\n\"At this point, we've got to get angry,\" coach Rick Carlisle said. \"We've got to get more together. We've got to have two great practice days. That's where we are.\"\n\nThe Knicks shot just 24 percent from 3-point territory against the worst defending team from long range, but they made up for it inside the arc. New York shot 71 percent (39 of 55) on 2-pointers and was at 55 percent overall for the game.\n\nLance Thomas scored nine of his 10 points when the Knicks took control in the third and assisted during the surge on Robinson's reverse alley-oop dunk .\n\n\"I was high in the air, so why not just go ahead and do something?\" asked Robinson, the former Louisiana high school standout whose previous rebounding high was six.\n\nDorian Finney-Smith had 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting for the Mavericks, but Harrison Barnes was held to 1 of 7 from 3-point range while scoring 14 points. DeAndre Jordan had a season-low four points and matched his lowest rebounding total this season with 10.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKnicks: Damyean Dotson just missed his second double-double of the season, finishing with 11 points and eight rebounds. ... Others among the seven double-figure scorers were Enes Kanter (13 points) and Mario Hezonja (11).\n\nMavericks: G Devin Harris was out again with a left hamstring strain. He hasn't played since the opener. ... J.J. Barea matched his season low with two points, attempting just five shots. He equaled Doncic with six assists.\n\nMITCHELL'S MODEL\n\nRobinson's best game so far came against Jordan, the 6-foot-11 center who extended his Dallas record with his ninth straight double-digit rebound game to start a season. Robinson matched Jordan on the boards and was much more of a factor offensively, going 5 of 6 from the field. \"I think DeAndre is a guy that Mitchell looks up to, and really respects,\" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. \"Obviously there are a lot of similarities there that we're going to be using DeAndre as a model for Mitchell.\"\n\nDEFENSE FIRST\n\nAnother versatile game from Doncic, who has been Dallas' best player in his first two-plus weeks, prompted questions for Carlisle over whether the rookie should have a more prominent role in the offense. Carlisle was thinking about the sixth game out of nine in which the Mavericks have allowed at least 50 percent shooting. \"I'm so much more focused on the defense that the questions about the offense, to me, are insignificant,\" the coach said. \"It's become too commonplace. That's not going to get it, and I know we can do better.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams play Washington. The Knicks are at the Wizards on Sunday, and the Mavericks get them at home Tuesday after a three-day break.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) \u2014 Darrin Hall had already had a big night against a team that game-planned to stop him when he put a dazzling cap on it.\n\nHall ran for 229 yards and three touchdowns, the last a 75-yard burst one play after Virginia had awakened it fans by closing to within 14-13, and Pittsburgh beat No. 23 Virginia for the fourth year in a row, 23-13 on Friday night.\n\nHall also had a 41-yard scoring run in the first half and a two-yard run in the third quarter, capping a drive that ended with an injury-depleted Cavaliers defense looking incapable of stopping the bruising 225-pound tailback.\n\n\"That's all we do. We just continue to fight, continue to wear down the defense,\" said Hall, who carried just 19 times.\n\nThe two-yard run capped a 15-play, 84-yard march and gave the Panthers a 14-10 lead and seemed to wear Virginia down.\n\n\"Even on short yardage, I was getting 4 yards before I was even touched,\" he said.\n\nThe Panthers (5-4, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) moved into first place in the Coastal Division.\n\n\"That's great. That's awesome,\" left guard Connor Dintino said. \"But next week we've got (Virginia Tech). We've got to go 1-0. That's it. We're not thinking ahead.\"\n\nWith 738 rushing yards in the last two games, they seem to be hitting their stride.\n\n\"We did it the old fashioned way, running the football for 250 yards,\" coach Pat Narduzzi said. \"Darrin Hall was a beast.\"\n\nBryce Perkins threw for 205 yards and a touchdown for Virginia (6-3, 4-2, No. 23 CFP), but Pittsburgh never allowed him to get untracked in the running game and sacked him five times for 46 yards in losses. The Cavaliers' three-game winning streak was snapped.\n\n\"We got him a couple times in the backfield. That's the first thing,\" Narduzzi said of Perkins, who has three 100-plus-yard games this season but finished with minus 7 yards. \"Put pressure on him and force him to have to make some throws or make some decisions.\"\n\nPittsburgh trailed 10-7 at halftime, but used the drive that lasted 8:40 to go ahead. The Panthers converted four third downs on the march and Hall finished it with runs of 18 and 2 yards as the Virginia defense, which lost three starters during the game, began to wear down.\n\nAfter being limited to 24 plays in the first half, the Panthers ran 21 in the third quarter alone, mostly grinding on the ground.\n\n\"I don't think anything changed\" from the first half to the second half, Virginia linebacker Jordan Mack said. \"They were just executing at a high level and lack of execution from us.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers drove for Brian Delaney's second field goal, bringing the crowd alive, but Hall quieted them with his long scoring burst.\n\nFOOT LOOSE\n\nThe Panthers special teams botched a pair of extra point tries, but converted one when a penalty gave them a do-ver.\n\nNarduzzi said placekicker Alex Kessman was not to blame, and he clinched the victory with a 53-yard field goal, his fourth from 50 or more yards this season and the sixth of his career.\n\n\"That was a gigantic kick,\" Narduzzi said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nPittsburgh: The Panthers are very much a power running team, but Darrin Hall especially has break-away speed, too, as he showed on his long scoring runs. With tailbacks Hall and Qadree Ollison each weighing in at 225 pounds, their bruising style wore Virginia down during two long possessions to begin the second half.\n\nVirginia: The Cavaliers to find more offensive weapons to employ when teams focus great attention on Perkins, Olamide Zaccheaus and Jordan Ellis. Terrell Jana's 42-yard touchdown catch more than doubled his receiving yardage for the season (29), and he caught two more passes before halftime. And tight end Tanner Cowley had just three catches for 28 yards in the first eight games before taking a pass from Perkins 40 yards down the Virginia sideline in the first half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPittsburgh returns home to face long-time rival Virginia Tech in its final home game.\n\nVirginia wraps up a three-game homestand with its final home game, and last out-of-conference game, against Liberty.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The veteran guard was 6 for 15 from the field.\n\nChicago then had three chances on its final possession and came up empty.

The only way they could solve things was by themselves.\n\n\"We just said, you all stay out for a second. Let us talk,\" Chris Paul said. \"At some point, enough is enough.\"\n\nPaul had 32 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds, Carmelo Anthony added a season-high 28 points and Houston snapped a four-game losing streak with a 119-111 victory.\n\nClint Capela finished with 22 points and 13 rebounds, and Eric Gordon contributed 21 points for the Rockets, who had stumbled to a 1-5 start a season after winning 65 games and falling a game short of the NBA Finals.\n\n\"We had to watch it, we had to look at it and we had to kind of just hold ourselves accountable to what's going on out there,\" Anthony said. \"Look our own selves in the mirror as individuals, as a team, figure out what we wanted to do and tonight we did that.\"\n\nThey did thanks to one of the best games as a Rocket for Paul, who had season bests in points and assists in the final game before his workload should ease Saturday with the expected return of James Harden. The league MVP missed his third straight game with a strained left hamstring and coach Mike D'Antoni said he would probably return for the second half of a back-to-back in Chicago.\n\nAnthony bounced back from a 2-for-12, eight-point performance against Portland by coming off the bench to hit six 3-pointers.\n\nCaris LeVert scored 29 points for the Nets, who got off to a sizzling start before the Rockets turned around the game.\n\nOne of the NBA's most potent offenses had been held below 90 points in two of the previous three games after doing so only three times all last season. The offense was back Friday, but the defense took a while to get going.\n\nBrooklyn made 14 of its first 18 shots, including 13 of 14 inside the 3-point arc while simply driving by defenders.

Paul's highest-scoring game with the Rockets is 37 points last Jan. 10 against Portland.\n\nNets: Atkinson said there was no decision yet if rookies Rodions Kurucs and Dzanan Musa would play for Long Island on Saturday in its season opener.

You don't change up a foul shot. We're not even making those,\" D'Antoni said. \"So we've obviously got some kind of malaise over us that we've got to shrug off and get going.\"\n\nThe Rockets entered shooting 70.2 percent at the line, 27th in the NBA, after finishing ninth last season at 78.1 percent.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockets: Visit Chicago on Saturday.\n\nNets: Host Philadelphia on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Things were going so well for Los Angeles Clippers guard Lou Williams on Friday night that even when one of his shots missed, he ended up getting credit for a basket.\n\nWilliams scored 23 of his game-high 28 points in the second half in leading the Clippers to a 120-95 rout of the Orlando Magic.\n\nIt was the Clippers' 10th straight win over the Magic.\n\nWilliams hit all five 3-point attempts in the second half, including one that clearly bounced far off the rim. But he got credit anyway when referee Sean Corbin called goaltending on Magic rookie Mo Bamba.\n\n\"Lou got it going in the third and fourth quarter and that changed the game,\" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \"He is just an amazing, amazing shooter and he shoots from all angles. It used to be he could only go left and now he goes right. He is a professional scorer and you see it every time he plays.\"\n\nTobias Harris had 21 points and Danilo Gallinari 13 for Los Angeles, which led by 15 going into the fourth period and quickly pushed it to 25 after Williams hit three straight 3s to make it 106-81 with 6:57 left.\n\nBoban Marjanovic made his first start for the Clippers and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nNikola Vucevic led Orlando with 22 points and 11 rebounds. Evan Fournier scored 19 and D.J.

Clifford says his team needs to start its rebound with a change of attitude.\n\n\"We have the wrong, wrong attitude,\" Clifford said after his team was routed by the Clippers. \"There have been some tough times here and we have some guys who have been through that, but we have to have great attitude, great fight and great readiness and we had none of that tonight. Maybe this is going to be harder to do than I thought.\"\n\nGREAT FIRST IMPRESSION\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers invited Magic rookie Mo Bamba in for a workout before last summer's NBA Draft and he made quite an impression on coach Doc Rivers. Bamba brought a CD of himself that contained highlights of his best offensive moves to show how far his game had progressed.\n\n\"He wanted us to see all that and it was impressive,\" Rivers said. \"Steve Ballmer (Clippers owner) was in the room and I think it was the most impressive interview we ever had in the times I've done it. He's long, he already has great touch, he shoots the ball pretty well. He's going to be a good player.\"\n\nThe Magic grabbed Bamba with the sixth pick in the first round.

Lincoln Riley was the Sooners' offensive coordinator in a 66-59, Baker Mayfield-over-Patrick Mahomes touchdown fest at Texas Tech two years ago and will be on the sideline at his alma mater Saturday night for the first time since replacing Bob Stoops.\n\nRiley believes Murray is ready to make the run that Mayfield pulled off a year ago \u2014 lead the Sooners (7-1, 4-1 Big 12) back from an early October loss to run the table in November, win a Big 12 championship and qualify for the four-team tournament.\n\n\"The whole journey gets you ready for this,\" Riley said of Murray, who is expected to pursue pro baseball after one season as OU's starter. \"He's been at big moments, even early on his life. Felt like if he won the job, that he'd be ready for the opportunity.\"\n\nThis is just the beginning of high-profile Big 12 opportunities for Texas Tech freshman Alan Bowman, the conference's leading passer. The Red Raiders (5-3, 3-2) cost themselves a tie for the league lead with a 40-31 loss at Iowa State last week, but now get a chance to knock the Sooners out of that spot \u2014 and likely out of playoff consideration.\n\n\"I watched a guy who is favored to be the MVP of the NFL go up there and have a really, really rough day, as well,\" coach Kliff Kingsbury said, referring to the Red Raiders' 66-10 loss at the Cyclones in Mahomes' final season two years ago, before Kansas City drafted him in the first round.\n\n\"He's a kid who doesn't blink,\" Kingsbury said of Bowman, who was called for a safety on a desperation throwaway out of the end zone to break a 31-31 tie against Iowa State. \"Got that ball back at the end, expected to win the game. It didn't work out. He'll come back and play better than he has, is my expectation for him Saturday.\"\n\nThe Sooners, also seventh in the first CFP rankings released this week, bounced back with a pair of 50-plus-point outings in wins over TCU and Kansas State following a loss to No. 15 Texas.\n\n\"These last couple weeks, we've just been out there playing for each other,\" linebacker Kenneth Murray said. \"It's not offense, special teams, defense. It's the Oklahoma Sooners. I think right now, our brotherhood is at an all-time high.\"\n\nRUFFIN'S REUNION\n\nRuffin McNeill took over as defensive coordinator at Oklahoma after Riley fired Mike Stoops following Texas' 501-yard showing in a 48-45 win. McNeill was promoted at Texas Tech under similar circumstances in 2007, and spent the next two full seasons in that role before becoming head coach at East Carolina. He was with the Red Raiders for 10 seasons, including when Kingsbury was the quarterback.\n\nThe Sooners held the Horned Frogs and Wildcats to less than 300 yards. \"He tells us all the time he lives in Norman now, and the best offense lives in Norman, the best defense lives in Norman, the best special teams lives in Norman,\" Kenneth Murray said.\n\nNOVEMBERS TO REMEMBER\n\nThe Sooners have won 13 consecutive November games since 2014, and not coincidentally have three straight Big 12 titles \u2014 all with Mayfield at quarterback. \"A lot of other people are getting tired of it, tired of the grind, the process, tired of all the little things these guys have got to do day-in and day-out,\" Riley said. \"Our players have embraced it.\"\n\nIT JUST SO HAPPENS\n\nMayfield, the first overall pick this past spring by Cleveland, and Mahomes are facing off in the NFL on the same weekend as their former college teams, with the Chiefs visiting the Browns on Sunday. It's just another reason to remember the video-game display in 2016, when each team had exactly 854 yards total offense and Mahomes threw 88 passes, one shy of the national record. Kingsbury said he didn't plan to watch Mahomes try to get the Chiefs to 8-1. \"We'll be right back at it,\" he said. \"I'll keep track of it.\"\n\nTHIS AND THAT\n\nThe Sooners have won 18 straight true road games over four seasons. ...

(Photo: Sean Gardner, Getty Images)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 Martin Truex Jr. didn\u2019t deny his text to Joey Logano after he was spun out last weekend at Martinsville Speedway included profanity.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get his point of view and what he was thinking,\u201d Truex told reporters at Texas Motor Speedway on Friday. \u201cWhat he thought about it. Now I know.\u201d\n\nThat knowledge didn\u2019t change how Truex feels about Logano nudging him out of the way just feet from the finish line at Martinsville. Like he did minutes after his third-place finish Sunday, Truex again dropped a \u201ccheap shot\u201d mention on Friday.\n\nThere\u2019s little chance Truex will seek retribution at Sunday\u2019s AAA Texas 500 (3 p.m. ET, NBCSN), where Ryan Blaney will start on the pole as Ford swept the top five qualifying slots. Plus, Logano\u2019s Martinsville win locked him into the Championship 4, so revenge here this weekend would be fairly hollow.\n\nTruex, who qualified 13th on Friday, is among the seven remaining drivers seeking to compete for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship at the season finale on Nov. 18 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nTEXAS: Pressure is off Logano in Round of 8\n\nBRIAN FRANCE: NASCAR CEO's DWI case continued until December\n\nCHAMPION EXCHANGE: Johnson, Alonso will swap NASCAR, F1 cars\n\n\u201cI am not going to let what happened last week take my focus off of that,\u201d Truex said. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that stays on the top of your mind \u2014 if you get in a certain situation where it would be wise to remember what happened. That\u2019s there. I really haven\u2019t thought past that. I know what\u2019s on the line this weekend.\u201d\n\nLogano said he was in no hurry to contact Truex via text after his No. 22 Team Penske Ford bumper made contact with Truex\u2019s No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Toyota.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I was surprised that he texted me,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI am glad he did. It kind of broke the ice. I was planning on waiting a couple days to let things settle. It got a lot of things out of the way. We both know where we stand.\u201d\n\nThe budding driver spat hasn\u2019t gotten to the level of Kyle Busch and Brad Keselowski\u2019s running feud. Yet.\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going to be,\u201d said Busch, who won at Texas this spring and qualified 10th Friday as he seeks entry into the Championship 4. \u201cI guess that\u2019s going to be the new norm eventually of some sort. Overall, it\u2019s just there\u2019s certain guys and individuals that you can race that wouldn\u2019t do those sorts of things.\u201d\n\nBusch spun out Truex late in a race at Bristol in August, leading Truex to kick the side of his car in frustration. Truex told reporters afterward that he didn\u2019t think Busch wrecked him on purpose.\n\n\u201cSome people think it\u2019s perfectly fine to knock a guy out of the way to get a win,\u201d Truex said. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s not. We all think differently. It\u2019s the not the way I have ever done it. Whether it\u2019s Go-Karts or Modified cars. No matter what it was, that\u2019s the way I was taught to race.\n\n\"You race fair. You race clean and you race as hard as you can straight up. I can say that every single win I have had, I earned it. That\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' A.J.

(AP Photo/Larry Papke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Clint Bowyer went more than 200 mph like polesitter Ryan Blaney during NASCAR Cup qualifying at Texas.\n\n\"It's so hard to sit here and explain to somebody what that lap feels like, and the adjustments you have to make,\" Bowyer said. \"You have to be committed. You can't just feel it out at that point.\"\n\nBlaney earned the pole Friday at 200.505 mph at the 1 1/2-mile Texas track, just ahead of Bowyer's 200.230 mph lap that was the fastest of the eight contenders still alive in the playoff.\n\n\"Really fast lap after leaving Martinsville, of all places,\" Bowyer said, referring to last week's race at the half-mile paperclip-shaped track.\n\nBlaney described the fast lap of just under 27 seconds as like almost holding his breath.\n\nAll four Stewart-Haas drivers were the top qualifiers among the championship contenders. Bowyer led the way, with teammates Kevin Harvick and Aric Almirola in the second row. Kurt Busch, who was going for his third consecutive poll at Texas, qualified seventh.\n\nThe only non-Ford in the top seven was the No. 11 Toyota of non-playoff driver Denny Hamlin in the sixth spot.\n\nJoey Logano, who is already locked into the season finale at Homestead after his win at Martinsville last week, qualified eighth, with Kyle Busch 10th.\n\nTwo of the playoff contenders didn't make it into the final round of qualifying.\n\nMartin Truex Jr, the defending Cup champion, qualified 13th and three spots ahead of Chase Elliott.\n\nSHORT OF A RECORD\n\nIn qualifying at Texas last November, Busch ran 200.915 mph on his only lap in the final round of qualifying to set the track record. Five drivers qualified at more than 200 mph for that race.\n\nOUT OF TOP 10 AGAIN\n\nElliott was the worst of the playoff qualifiers at Texas for the second year in a row. Last fall at Texas, seven of the eight championship contenders started in the top 10 spots. The only one that didn't was Elliott, who was among seven drivers who didn't make any qualifying laps after not making it through tech inspection in time. He started 34th, and went on to finish eighth.\n\nPOLE NUMBERS\n\nBlaney won his third pole this season, and fifth in his career. It is his first in eight races at Texas.\n\nWHO'S OUT: There were 41 cars on the entry list for 40 spots in the race.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Washington outfielder Bryce Harper and Boston closer Craig Kimbrel were among just seven free agents who received $17.9 million qualifying offers from their former clubs Friday, when Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw agreed to a $93 million, three-year contract rather than test the market.\n\nLeft-handers Patrick Corbin (Arizona), Dallas Keuchel (Houston) and Hyun-Jin Ryu (Los Angeles Dodgers) also received qualifying offers as did outfielder A.J. Pollock (Diamondbacks) and catcher Yasmani Grandal (Dodgers).\n\nPlayers have until Nov. 12 to accept. If a team makes a qualifying offer to a player who signs a major league contract with another club before the June amateur draft, his former club would receive a draft pick as compensation at the end of the first round.\n\nOnly five of 73 players given qualifying offers have accepted since the process began in 2012.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs exercised their $20 million option on left-hander Cole Hamels, who went 4-3 with a 2.36 ERA in 12 starts after he was acquired from Texas on July 27. The Cubs traded left-hander Drew Smyly to the Rangers, clearing his $7 million salary from the payroll. That is $1 million more than the Rangers would have owed the Cubs if Hamels' option had been declined, which would have triggered a $6 million buyout and allowed him to go free.\n\nKershaw terminated a $215 million, seven-year contract that had $65 million remaining at $32 million next year and $33 million in 2020. The new deal calls for a $23 million signing bonus, payable in equal installments on June 30 in each of the next three years, and annual salaries of $23,333,333. He can earn $4 million annually in performance bonuses, in four $1 million increments for 24, 26, 28 and 30 starts, which could raise the deal's value to $105 million over three years.\n\nHe also can gain award bonuses of $1.5 million for winning the NL Cy Young Award or $500,000 for finishing second or third in the voting.\n\n\"There's been a lot of people saying that I'm in decline or not going to be as good as I once was,\" said Kershaw, whose Dodgers lost in the World Series for the second straight year. \"I'm looking forward to proving a lot of people wrong with that.\"\n\nKershaw, who turns 31 in March, has spent all 11 of his big league seasons with the Dodgers.\n\n\"It was more valuable to me to just stay here,\" he said. \"A chance to win every single year, it doesn't come around like this in LA very often.\"\n\nTop free agents prefer to seek multiyear contracts, but given the greater priority placed on draft picks in recent years, Ryu and Grandal might face a difficult market and consider accepting the offers.\n\nA free agent can be made a qualifying offer only if he has been with the same team continuously since opening day and has never received a qualifying offer before. Because of those rules, Manny Machado and Josh Donaldson were among the players who were ineligible to receive offers. The amount is the average of the top 125 major league contracts this year by average annual value.\n\nHarper and Machado are the top players available on the market, though Machado's value may have been damaged by a rocky postseason in which he hit .227, showed a remarkable lack of hustle and was fined $10,000 for stepping on a first baseman's foot.\n\nOthers among the 160 available free agents include right-handers Nathan Eovaldi and Charlie Morton, left-handers J.A. Happ and CC Sabathia, relievers Zach Britton, Andrew Miller, David Robertson and Jeurys Familia, outfielder Michael Brantley, third baseman Mike Moustakas, infielder Daniel Murphy, designated hitter Nelson Cruz and utilityman Marwin Gonzalez.\n\nKershaw was among four players who became free agents and immediately re-signed this week, joined by St. Louis right-hander Adam Wainwright, Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner and Dodgers outfielder David Freese.\n\nCleveland is interested in re-signing Brantley but did not want to commit $17.9 million for one year.\n\n\"We could not have any more respect for any individual than we have for Michael,\" general manager Chris Antonetti said. \"He's the guy that epitomizes, as I've shared before, all of the things we look for in a player. He's exceedingly productive on the field. He defines professionalism in the clubhouse, and he's an extraordinary teammate. The interest and desire is there. What we will have to work through is, can we make the pieces fit?\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Beth Harris in Los Angeles and Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nBrett Kavanaugh at his Supreme Court confirmation hearing on Sept. 27, 2018. (Photo: Pool photo by Jim Bourg)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Just days before the midterm elections, Sen. Chuck Grassley asked the federal authorities on Friday to investigate another person he says made false claims against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nGrassley, in a letter to the Department of Justice and FBI, said a woman by the name of Judy Munro-Leighton took responsibility for authoring an anonymous letter that made allegations that Kavanaugh and a friend raped her. After she was tracked down and interviewed by Senate investigators, the woman recanted and said she was not, in fact. the author and had never met Kavanaugh.\n\nGrassley claims the woman is a left-wing activist and told investigators it was \"just a ploy,\" he wrote in the letter. Her full comments to investigators were not made available and efforts by USA TODAY to reach Munro-Leighton were unsuccessful.\n\nGrassley asked for federal authorities to investigate her on allegations of making false statements and obstruction.\n\nThe letter marks at least the fourth request Grassley has made of federal authorities to investigate those involved in the controversial Kavanaugh proceedings, which were extended due to a series of sexual assault allegations surfacing when Kavanaugh was in high school and college.\n\nKavanaugh has denied all the allegations.\n\nGrassley has thus far asked federal authorities to investigate: Julie Swetnick, who accused Kavanaugh of drunken behavior and sexual assault; Michael Avenatti, her lawyer who also represented porn star Stormy Daniels in a suit against President Donald Trump; and a man, who was never publicly identified but recanted an allegation he'd made against Kavanaugh.\n\nMunro-Leighton was brought into the saga after a graphic and anonymous letter was sent to Sen. Kamala Harris in California. The letter included a story about Kavanaugh and another male groping, sexually assaulting and ultimately raping a woman in a vehicle after a party.\n\nThe letter was signed by a Jane Doe from Oceanside, Calif.\n\nThe allegations came amid a number of other stories from women, including Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed Kavanaugh had assaulted them when they were in high school or college.\n\nKavanaugh was questioned about the letter in September under oath and categorically denied the allegations.\n\n\"The whole thing is ridiculous,\" he said. \"The whole thing is just a crock, farce, wrong, didn\u2019t happen, not anything close.\"\n\nSeveral days later Grassley says Munro-Leighton wrote an email that included her name. He said Senate investigators were able to track her down and found she lived in Kentucky, not California, and was a Democrat.\n\nInvestigators got in touch with her over the phone and Munro-Leighton admitted she wrote the email after seeing the \"Jane Doe\" letter in news reports. She said she claimed to be Jane Doe so the letter would gain attention, \"I was angry and I sent it out,\" the woman told investigators, according to Grassley's letter, but in fact did not write it.\n\nGrassley said the false allegation diverted resources on a time-sensitive matter. It's unclear whether the true author was located or whether the inidivudal came forward.\n\nCLOSE The polarizing battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has ended, but voter repercussions could be coming soon. USA TODAY\n\n\"The Committee is grateful to citizens who come forward with relevant information in good faith, even if they are not one hundred percent sure about what they know,\" he wrote in the letter to the FBI and DOJ. \"But when individuals intentionally mislead the Committee, they divert Committee resources during time-sensitive investigations and materially impede our work. Such acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal.\"\n\nThe timing of the request could help reignite Kavanaugh's role in the midterm elections. Both Republicans and Democrats say all the controversy surrounding his confirmation could help boost voter engagement in Tuesday's election.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/02/brett-kavanaugh-accuser-referred-fbi-doj-investigation/1863210002/"]
