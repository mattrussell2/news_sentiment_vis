In Washington on Tuesday, the skies cleared from west to east just at sunset, allowing folks to look back to the east to see the rainbow.\n\nEarly morning and late afternoon are typically the best times to see them because the sun must not be too high. As well, rainbows are always opposite the sun.\n\nAccording to the Bible, the rainbow is the sign of God's promise to mankind that he will never again flood the Earth, according to the book \"The Science and Wonders of the Atmosphere,\" by Stanley Gedzelman.\n\nRegardless of what the rainbow foretold, social media was atwitter with photos of the breathtaking scene:\n\nAnother view of the Capitol rainbow tonight.

The charismatic forward is under contract with the club for next season, but a few things have to happen if he is to return.\n\n\"I have some wishes and demands which is simple things,\" Ibrahimovic said Tuesday as players had end of season meetings. \"There is interest in Europe, but my priority is Galaxy.

In order for him to earn more next year, the Galaxy would have to part ways with one of their three designated players.\n\nGalaxy president Chris Klein said initial conversations with Ibrahimovic have been promising, and bringing him back is a top priority for the club.\n\n\"What he did this year is certainly well documented,\" Klein said. \"He wants to win and we want to win with him.

LA (13-12-9) would have earned the final spot in the Western Conference with a win in its final regular-season game but squandered a two-goal lead to Houston and lost 3-2.\n\nThe club announced Tuesday they fired vice president of soccer operations Pete Vagenas. Klein said he hopes to have that spot filled soon. Former Galaxy and US national team coach Bruce Arena is believed to be a candidate.\n\nThey also have to decide on a head coach. Dominic Kinnear was 3-2-1 after replacing Sigi Schmid in early September and drew positive reviews from most players, including Ibrahimovic.\n\n\"I think the season was like a roller coaster. Hopefully we make it better because that is the target,\" Ibrahimovic said. \"I want to be able to challenge for the trophy. Like I said, I'm not here for a vacation, I'm here for the challenge and I want to feel my team has a chance to be the best in MLS. I am the best, but I want to feel like my team can compete against the others.\"", "Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger (7) throws to a receiver in the second half of an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger sat out practice on Tuesday to give his broken left index finger a rest but he is expected to play on Thursday night when Carolina visits Heinz Field.\n\nRoethlisberger said the finger was \"fine\" after he threw the ball 47 times in last Sunday's victory over Baltimore.\n\nHe did leave the game briefly in the third quarter after getting the wind knocked out of him, but he returned after missing just one snap.\n\nThe 36-year-old is on pace to top 5,000 yards passing for the first time in his career. He came close in 2014 when he tied Drew Brees for the league lead with 4,952. Roethlisberger said reaching the 5,000-yard plateau \"is still a pretty big deal\" but he is keeping his focus on the team.\n\nThe Steelers (5-2-1) have ripped off four straight wins to climb into first in the AFC North. The short week means they won't have much time to prepare for the surging Panthers (6-2), which might not be a bad thing. Roethlisberger expects to rely a little more heavily on the no-huddle offense, a setup in which he thrives.\n\n\"We've been doing it for a while,\" Roethlisberger said. \"We know it. We know it pretty well. We did it really well in Baltimore, really well, and just being able to pick up the pace and the tempo.\"\n\nThe Steelers often turn to the no-huddle in an effort to snap them out of a funk early in games, but Roethlisberger isn't using it as a method of trying to get the ball downfield.\n\nWhile he's on track to set a career high in yards, his production has dipped a bit during Pittsburgh's winning streak. He's gone over 300 yards just once in Pittsburgh's past five games after going over 330 yards in each of the first three weeks.\n\nAn improved defense has helped. Roethlisberger lit up scoreboards early because the Steelers were trying to keep up with opponents who had little trouble getting to the end zone.\n\nThat's not happening much anymore. Now that Roethlisberger isn't tasked with trying to play catch up, the Steelers have taken a more balanced approach.\n\nSecond-year running back James Conner is second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage and Roethlisberger is content to keep throwing the ball underneath to move the chains and keep Pittsburgh's defense off the field. And just like that, Pittsburgh's sluggish 1-2-1 start has become a distant memory.\n\n\"There was no panic in this room early in the season,\" Roethlisberger said. \"That's why we got a good chuckle out of (the media) panicking and the outside world panicking, but for us it was just a matter of playing the next week.\"\n\nNOTES: Right tackle Marcus Gilbert (knee) did not practice and is unlikely to play, meaning Matt Feiler will make his third straight start. ... NT Daniel McCullers (ankle) also did not practice. ... WR Antonio Brown (coach's decision) and WR Ryan Switzer (ankle) were limited. ... WR James Washington (knee) was a full participant.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 With voting for the 2018 Ballon d'Or closing this week, Antoine Griezmann boosted his chances of lifting the most prestigious individual trophy in soccer with an inspired display and a goal in his 50th Champions League game on Tuesday.\n\nGriezmann helped Atletico Madrid bounce back from a heavy loss to Borussia Dortmund with a 2-0 win over the German club, a result that sent last year's semifinalist Monaco crashing out.\n\nLiverpool was handed a 2-0 shock loss at Red Star Belgrade while Barcelona, without Lionel Messi, drew 1-1 at Inter Milan in the evening's showcase match to become the first team to progress to the knockout stage this season.\n\nRed Star's victory left Group C wide open after Napoli was held to a 1-1 home draw by Paris Saint-Germain, with all four teams still in contention in a very tight pool.\n\nGriezmann, who has scored 10 goals in his last 10 home matches in the tournament, was set up by midfielder Thomas Partey and concluded the smooth counterattack with a soft touch from inside the area in the 80th minute after Saul Niguez had put the hosts ahead.\n\nDortmund and Atletico are atop Group A. Dortmund routed Atletico 4-0 last month at home in what was the Spanish team's worst loss under coach Diego Simeone.\n\nEarlier, Monaco was handed a humiliating 4-0 defeat by Club Brugge that prematurely ended the club's Champions League ambitions as Thierry Henry once again failed to secure a first win as coach. It was Club Brugge's first group win in 13 years.\n\nHans Vanaken scored twice, Brazilian forward Wesley made it 3-0 and captain Ruud Vormer completed the rout. Monaco \u2014 which is winless in its last 15 matches \u2014 can't qualify for the knockout phase.\n\nBARCELONA THROUGH\n\nWithout Messi, Barcelona was still the better team but failed to convert its chances at San Siro stadium.\n\nDespite the draw, the Catalan team sealed its spot in the next round.\n\nMessi had traveled with the team to Milan but Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde opted not to risk the star forward, who hasn't played since fracturing his arm last month. Substitute Malcom scored with seven minutes remaining but Mauro Icardi leveled in the 87th for the hosts.\n\nBarcelona is top of Group B, three points ahead of Inter and six ahead of Tottenham, which beat PSV Eindhoven 2-1. Harry Kane scored two late goals for Tottenham, which looked in danger of exiting the competition after just four games when the hosts went behind after only 61 seconds at Wembley.\n\nInstead, Kane's goals \u2014 in the 78th and 89th \u2014 gave the English team a glimmer of hope of a top-two finish.\n\nRED STAR SHINES AGAIN\n\nRed Star Belgrade revived memories of its time as one of Europe's top teams. Milan Pavkov scored in the 22nd and 29th minutes as the Serbian champions earned a first win in their debut appearance in the Champions League group stage. It last played in the European Cup in 1991 as holders, when beating the likes of Liverpool would not have been regarded as such a surprise.\n\nBack then, eastern European teams were genuine contenders for club football's biggest prize \u2014 Steaua Bucharest of Romania was European champion in 1986 \u2014 and Red Star had some of the world's best players like Robert Prosinecki and Dejan Savicevic.\n\nNearly three decades on, Red Star doesn't have a household name in its squad and needed to qualify for the group stage through the playoffs. It was thrashed 4-0 by Liverpool at Anfield when the gulf between the sides was huge.\n\nIn a competitive Group C, last season's runner-up Liverpool and Napoli have six points each after the Italian side and Paris Saint-Germain drew 1-1. Making his Champions League debut for PSG, goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon could not stop Lorenzo Insigne's equalizer from the penalty spot after Juan Bernat's opener just before halftime.\n\nVINTAGE PORTO\n\nPorto moved even closer to a spot in the knockout stage after beating Lokomotiv Moscow 4-1 to end the Russian champion's qualifying hopes.\n\nAfter scoring at Lokomotiv last month, Hector Herrera and Moussa Marega both netted again to help put Porto on 10 points at the top of Group D. With Schalke beating Galatasaray 2-0 in Tuesday's other game, Porto needs one point from its last two games to be sure of qualifying. Lokomotiv has lost all four games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 When Iowa State coach Matt Campbell challenged Hakeem Butler to become the Cyclones' go-to receiver this year, Butler simply nodded and went to work.\n\nNow, with the No. 23 Cyclones (5-3, 4-2 Big 12) heading into the stretch run of their season, Butler has more than met that challenge.\n\nHe leads the team in receptions, yardage and touchdowns. His average of 24 yards a catch leads the nation. Of Iowa State's 11 longest plays from scrimmage, Butler owns nine of them. Most were highlight reel-worthy.\n\n\"I'm in Hakeem's class. I came in with him,\" defensive back Braxton Lewis said Tuesday. \"When he makes those plays, to this day it still amazes me every time he does it.\"\n\nA 6-foot-6, 225-pound junior, Butler is freakishly athletic. He is strong enough to ward off defenders, fast enough to outrun them and has the hops and size to outjump them.\n\nAgainst Oklahoma earlier this year, Butler shed four would-be tacklers on a 51-yard touchdown play. Last week at Kansas, he reached behind him to catch the ball over the middle, turned upfield and easily outran the pursuit on an 83-yard touchdown.\n\nLess than 3 minutes later, he made an even more jaw-dropping play.\n\nRunning a deep route against cornerback Hasan Defense, Butler leaped over the defender to make the catch and then, while holding the ball with his left hand, used his right to fling Defense off him as if they were playing a kids' game of crack the whip. Defense recovered but couldn't catch Butler before he somersaulted into the end zone.\n\n\"I think Hakeem, bar none, is one of the most athletically talented guys I've ever had the opportunity to coach at the wide receiver position,\" Campbell said.\n\nCampbell inherited Butler when he arrived at Iowa State from Toledo in late November 2015. Former coach Paul Rhoads had signed Butler, who had no other offers from Power Five schools, at the urging of assistant coach Louis Ayeni, who was intrigued by Butler's size and athleticism. Iowa State got onto him late in the recruiting process and Butler, who was living in Travis, Texas, after growing up in Baltimore, committed two days before signing day.\n\nAfter redshirting in 2015, Butler played sparingly during Campbell's first season, catching just nine balls. He increased his production significantly last fall, catching 41 passes for 697 yards and seven touchdowns, but he was only a secondary target behind senior Allen Lazard. Still, he had two 100-yard receiving games, including a five-catch, 111-yard performance against Memphis in the Liberty Bowl.\n\nWith Lazard no longer around, the team needed a new primary receiver. Enter Butler, who has 33 receptions for 791 yards and eight touchdowns heading into Saturday's home game with Baylor (5-4, 3-3).\n\n\"I thought his offseason was maybe as good as anybody in our football program,\" Campbell said. \"So it was really fun to watch that maturity. He's really done that all three years since I've been here, gotten better every year and really has put himself in a great position to be a phenomenal player.\"\n\nSome would argue he's close to that already. He has topped 100 yards receiving in each of his last three games, has caught a touchdown pass in each of the last four and has worked his way onto the watch list for the Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation's top receiver. Some players make those lists on reputation; Butler did it with his performance.\n\nAnd if Campbell is to be believed, the best is yet to come.\n\n\"That's one thing I'm really excited about because I think there's still another level or two that he can get to in terms of some of the detail of playing the wide receiver position,\" Campbell said. \"I think you'll only see him get better because he does have that passion to be really, really special.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Democrats' chances are slim because only nine of the 35 seats on the ballot were in Republican hands. In the House, Democrats will need to pick up 23 seats to gain a majority \u2014 and both history and the polls are on their side.\n\nAs polls close across the nation, results will help signal what the outcome could look like nationwide.\n\nHere's your guide, hour-by-hour, on what results we'll be looking for and why.\n\nMore: Americans cast their votes in midterm elections amid reports of long lines, other problems\n\nCLOSE Unless you\u2019re a political junkie, it\u2019s not easy keeping track of the seats up for election. Here\u2019s why midterm elections and chamber control matters. USA TODAY\n\nPolls closing at 6 p.m.\n\nWhere the fun starts.\n\nThe first polls to close will be in parts of Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nBoth states were won by Donald Trump in the 2016 election. While the president isn't on the ballot, this year's midterm races have been viewed as a referendum on Donald Trump's policies.\n\nSo, results in these states could be the earliest indicator of what Tuesday evening could look like nationwide.\n\nIndiana has nine House races, two of which are considered in play. Both are currently controlled by Republicans but Democrats are hoping to flip them.\n\nRepublican Rep. Trey Hollingsworth faces Bloomington attorney Liz Watson in Indiana's 9th Congressional District, while Republican Rep. Jackie Walorski faces Methodist minister-turned-health care company executive Mel Hall in the 2nd District.\n\nIndiana's tight Senate race has been watched nationally. Polling has shown a toss-up race between incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly and Republican Mike Braun.\n\nIn Kentucky, the state's six House seats are up for grabs but only one has been viewed as a potential toss up.\n\nKentucky's 6th district is currently held by Republican Rep. Andy Barr. He's been running a tough campaign against Democrat Amy McGrath, whose initial campaign video went viral as she walked down a runway with jets lined up behind her, telling the camera, \u201cSome are telling me a Democrat can\u2019t win that battle in Kentucky. We\u2019ll see about that.\u201d\n\nLocal political experts believe Barr is in trouble.\n\nPolls closing at 7 p.m.\n\nSome polls start to close in the 7 p.m. hour in about 10 states. That includes Georgia, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama and West Virginia.\n\nSeveral key races in these states, most of which Trump won in 2016, could be the clearest showing on if a blue wave is affecting results and whether it could mean trouble for Republicans.\n\nAll of Virginia's 11 House seats are up for grabs but Virginia's 7th District could be a toss-up. Rep. Dave Brat won a major upset in 2014 when he ousted GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor during the Republican primary. He faces former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger. Polls show the two are in a virtual tie.\n\nThe state's Senate seat held by Sen. Tim Kaine is also being contested, but polls show him leading by a large margin against Republican Corey Stewart.\n\nMore: Election Day 2018: Women candidates could make history\n\nMore: Midterms 2018: These candidates of color are ready to make history\n\nMore: Dems could make history if they lose Senate seats while winning the House\n\nMore: Trump braces for Democratic takeover of House after midterm elections\n\nMore: Democrats expect to gain in governor\u2019s races, build momentum for 2020\n\nRaces in Florida, as always, are being watched closely. Florida's tight Senate race could mean trouble for Democrats. Incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson maintains a slight lead over Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott. Three separate polls conducted over the weekend show Nelson with leads of 4, 5 and 7 points \u2013 all giving the Democrat at least 50 percent of the vote.\n\nFlorida's gubernatorial race has also been equal parts contentious and bitter. Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum aims to become Florida's first black governor. He ran a liberal campaign while GOP candidate Rep. Ron DeSantis emphasized his close ties to Trump.\n\nIn Georgia's gubernatorial race, Democrat Stacey Abrams is vying to become the first African-American woman governor in U.S. history. She is locked in a tight race with GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Kemp has a 2-point lead in three of the past four polls.\n\nThe Senate race in West Virginia is one of the closest watched races nationwide. Incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin is facing a tough battle against the state's Republican attorney general, Patrick Morrisey.\n\nPolls closing at 8 p.m.\n\nA cascade of states from the South to the Northeast will close their polls at 8 p.m., including Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and New Jersey \u2014 all of which have key races.\n\nIn Missouri, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill has distanced herself from her party in a bid to win her third term in a state that fell easily to President Donald Trump in 2016. She faces Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, who's in a virtual tie with the incumbent.\n\nTennessee's Senate race between Republican nominee Marsha Blackburn and Democrat Phil Bredesen has looked like a dead heat in recent polls. An East Tennessee State University poll showed Blackburn with a major advantage among men and Bredesen with a strong lead among women, including pop superstar Taylor Swift.\n\nIf Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith wins Mississippi's Senate race, she would would be the state's first elected woman in Congress after being appointed in April. If her opponent, Democrat Mike Espy, wins, he would be the first African-American to represent the state since Reconstruction. Both are in a three-way race including tea party Republican Chris McDaniel, with a single candidate needing to win 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff between the top two.\n\nHillary Clinton carried New Jersey handily in 2016, and Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, 64, leads Republican challenger Bob Hugin by 10 points, according to a RealClearPolitics.com average, though some Democrats fear Menendez's dismal favorability rating.\n\nMore: Hillary Clinton encourages people to vote: 'Today, we say enough'\n\nMore: 82-year-old woman votes for the first time, then dies\n\nMore: Election Day 2018: What time do polls close in my state?\n\nPolls closing at 9 p.m.\n\nAmong the states closing their polls by 9 p.m. EST: Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and New York.\n\nPolls across Texas will also be closed by 9, bringing the hotly contested Senate race between Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke and Republican Ted Cruz into focus. O\u2019Rourke has ranked raked in huge donations, but polls give Cruz an edge. Recent polls show Cruz solidly leading the race.\n\nAnother close race is Texas\u2019 32nd District. In the district just north of Dallas, 11-term GOP incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions is in the race of his life, facing Democrat Colin Allred, a civil rights attorney and former football player for the NFL\u2019s Tennessee Titans.\n\nIn Arizona, watch for a tight Senate race between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally. Recent polls have presented differing pictures of who\u2019s leading in that race.\n\nPolls closing at 10 p.m.\n\nTwo close Senate races will come to an end when polls close in Nevada and Montana at 10 p.m. EST. Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada is the only Republican facing re-election in a state Trump lost. Most polls show Democrat Jacky Rosen with a slight lead within the margin of error. A couple blue House seats also hang in the balance in Nevada.\n\nIn Montana, where Trump has made multiple campaign stops for Matt Rosendale since July, Democrat Sen. Jon Tester holds a razor-thin polling lead over his Republican challenger. Trump had a 20-point margin of victory in 2016, and his influence in the Treasure State has been especially pronounced this election season.\n\nIn Utah, Mitt Romney should coast to victory in his Senate bid. Also in Utah, Republican incumbent Mia Love will have a harder time holding her 4th District seat against Democrat Ben McAdams.\n\nIowa's gubernatorial race is a tossup between Democratic challenger Fred Hubbell and Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. The race has been the most expensive governor's race in state history.\n\nPolls closing at 11 p.m.\n\nVoting finishes up in California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Hawaii by 11 p.m. EST. A number of red House seats in California could flip blue, which would make for an interesting late night if control of the House is still close by this late. For example, Democrat Gil Cisneros held a narrow one point lead over Republican Young Kim in recent polls for California's 39th District, where Republican incumbent Edward Royce isn't seeking re-election.\n\nDemocrats may also be able to flip Washington's 8th District, which Republicans won comfortably in 2016. Campaign spending for the open seat has topped over $25 million, and Republican Dino Rossi and Democrat Dr. Kim Schrier were in a dead heat in the most recent polls.\n\nPolls closing at 12 a.m. and 1 a.m.\n\nYou may be asleep when the polls close this late, but Alaska's gubernatorial race became more competitive after incumbent Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, dropped out of the race last month. Democrat Mark Begich got Walker's endorsement, but Republican Mike Dunleavy holds a narrow lead in most recent polls.\n\nContributing: Michael Collins, Maureen Groppe, Eliza Collins, Bill Theobald, Ledyard King, Bill Glauber, Todd Spangler and Ali Schmitz; KING-TV; Des Moines Register; Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/election-results-guide-midterm-elections-polls-close/1906703002/", "The Miami Heat\u2019s \u201cMiami Vice\u201d city edition uniforms are some of Nike\u2019s best work since taking over as the NBA\u2019s uniform supplier.\n\nEverything about the uniforms are perfect for Miami and deserve to be the team\u2019s full-time look.

The Tennessee Titans won 28-14. (AP Photo/Ron Jenkins) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee's three-game skid is over, and the Titans are back to .500 after a big road victory.\n\nBut before they can catch their breath, the Titans have a short week before they host the surging New England Patriots in what will be Tennessee's lone home game in November.\n\nCoach Mike Vrabel understands the challenge \u2014 and opportunity \u2014 the Titans have going against his old coach, Bill Belichick.\n\n\"We've just gotten ourselves to the surface where there's a little bit of air, a little bit of water,\" Vrabel said Tuesday. \"You're kind of taking a little bit of both in and you can't survive there for long. But you can survive there for a few minutes. And so we got to make the next decision to see if we can get our heads completely above water.\"\n\nThe Titans (4-4) still trail the Houston Texans (6-3) inside the AFC South, but their 28-14 victory in Dallas on Monday night put Tennessee into the sixth and final playoff spot in the AFC for now. The Titans shook off a horrific start with two fumbles by Marcus Mariota on their first two drives to turn score a season-high in points after managing just 31 points all of October.\n\nVrabel credited the Titans with shaking off that start. Tennessee turned two turnovers into 14 points, came up with five sacks and held Ezekiel Elliott to just 61 yards rushing.\n\nOffensively, the young Titans showed serious signs of progress in offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur's scheme.\n\nThey converted 11 of 14 attempts on third down for a 78.6 percent rate that was the best in the NFL this season and tied for the league's highest in the past three years. The Titans tied up the game at 7-7 with the franchise's longest drive since Dec. 9, 2012, using up 8 minutes, 55 seconds.\n\nTennessee scored touchdowns on four of five trips inside the Dallas 20 against a Cowboys defense that came in as the NFL's second stingiest in the red zone. Mariota also completed passes to nine different receivers and had a season-high 119.9 passer rating throwing for 240 yards and two touchdowns. He ran for 32 more yards and another score.\n\n\"I hope it's that guys are understanding where they fit, what they need to do to get open and understand when they get open, Marcus is going to try to get them the ball,\" Vrabel said of the Titans' offense.\n\nLeft tackle Taylor Lewan, who spoke about the Titans deserving respect after a 3-1 start, said he is just relieved to win a game and get back to .500.\n\n\"I'll definitely keep my (expletive) mouth shut from now on about that kind of stuff,\" Lewan said. \"Daddy learned his lesson.\"\n\nCornerback Logan Ryan said the Titans knew they were in a must-win situation in Dallas and that one win in the NFL can turn things around.\n\n\"It was a huge win,\" Ryan said after the game. \"Now we know we've got a tough test next week, and we will be ready.\"\n\nThe Titans host the Patriots (7-2) on Sunday before heading back on the road to Indianapolis and Houston. The Patriots routed Tennessee 35-14 in an AFC divisional game last January. Titans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk fired Mike Mularkey after that game and chose Vrabel to take this franchise further.\n\n\"We have to just get our players as ready as we can for the game,\" Vrabel said.\n\nNotes: Vrabel made it clear he didn't like safety Kevin Byard celebrating his interception by running to the star at midfield and posing like Terrell Owens 18 years ago. The coach said he plans to talk again with the safety and the Titans on Wednesday, and Vrabel said he wants them to celebrate with each other.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

He was treated for burns and cuts, and three others were treated for non-life threatening injuries.\n\nUllah was convicted of six federal charges, including the bombing of a public place, use of a weapon of mass destruction, providing support for a foreign terrorist organization, destruction of property by fire or explosive, terrorist attack against mass transportation systems and use of a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.\n\nHe faces up to life in prison at his sentencing on April 5.\n\nBoth the prosecution and defense attorneys agreed during the one-week trial that Ullah detonated the bomb but differed on whether he sought to harm others. In her closing statement Monday, Ullah's counsel Amy Galliccio argued that Ullah is \"troubled,\" but he only wanted to kill himself to send a message about the American treatment of Muslims worldwide, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"He wanted to die. He wanted to take his own life and only his life,\u201d Gallicchio said. \"This is not a suicide bombing.

Ullah at one point warned a law enforcement officer while he was in custody that \"more is coming,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe prosecution also showed video throughout the trial tracking Ullah from his apartment in Brooklyn until he set off the bomb in the subway.\n\nDuring opening statements, the prosecution presented the bomb itself as evidence that Ullah intended to harm others because it contained screws and shrapnel. They said Ullah would not have used such a bomb if he only wanted to harm himself and cited a Facebook posting he made the morning of the attack that said, \"Trump you failed to protect your nation.\"\n\nUllah has been held without bail since being charged.\n\nCLOSE Authorities in New York announced federal charges against a man, Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh, who set off a bomb in the New York City subway on Monday.

The former Eagles offensive coordinator has installed an offensive scheme that has protected Andrew Luck from hits and taken advantage of his quick decision making skills. Reich also deserves credit for sticking with defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, who was brought in before the Reich was hired. His defense has played with a ton of energy and looks better than any of the units we saw under the former coaching staff. \u00a9 Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNagy has done exactly what the Bears brought him in to do: Make things easier on Mitch Trubisky. The second-year quarterback hasn\u2019t been very sharp throughout the 2018 season, but you wouldn\u2019t know it looking at his numbers. Most of the credit belongs to Nagy\u2019s offensive scheme, which has provided Trubisky with open receivers all season. Nagy\u2019s decision to retain defensive coordinator Vic Fangio was a no-brainer, but more stubborn coaches may have decided to bring in their own guy. \u00a9 Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSo Vrabel\u2019s pick for offensive coordinator hasn\u2019t really worked out, but there\u2019s no denying that the Titans defense is playing better under the former Texans assistant. After Monday night\u2019s win in Dallas, the Titans lead the NFL in points allowed. Vrabel\u2019s best move has been bringing in former Ravens defensive coordinator Dean Pees, who has done a fantastic job of tailoring his game plan to whatever opponent Tennessee is playing. \u00a9 Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWith how much mental stress Patricia\u2019s defense puts on its players, it was always going to take more than an offseason for the Bill Belichick understudy to bring in guys capable of running it effectively.

Patricia\u2019s little dust up with the media last week may be a sign that he\u2019s not handling his new responsibilities as well as the Detroit front office would have hoped. Some guys just aren\u2019t cut out to be head coaches.

As I told my teammates, I've had a pretty long career and I've won at Napoli twice, so it's pretty complicated,\" said Buffon, who transferred to PSG for this season after nearly two decades at Juventus. \"I think PSG showed today we are a solid team and that's a crucial element if we want to go far in the Champions League.\"\n\nIn an extremely tight Group C, last season's finalist Liverpool and Napoli lead with six points each.\n\nPSG is next with five points and Red Star Belgrade, which stunned Liverpool 2-0 in Tuesday's other group game, is still in contention with four points.\n\nMbappe had been controlled by Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly before he finally broke free down the left flank and pulled back a cross for the advancing Bernat in first-half added time.\n\nThere was tension as the teams walked off the pitch at halftime as Koulibaly and Napoli midfielder Allan had to be separated from PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.\n\nNapoli coach Carlo Ancelotti then went to protest to the referee, perhaps because he thought there was more than the single minute of announced added time.\n\nHowever, it was a deserved advantage for PSG, which controlled for long stretches.\n\nAfter the break, Buffon showed that he's still \u2014 at age 40 \u2014 one of the world's most skillful goalkeepers with a series of reflex saves.\n\nFirst, Buffon deflected a dangerous angled effort from Dries Mertens. Then he made a leaping save to push another effort from Mertens over the bar with his fingertips.\n\nHowever, Buffon couldn't stop himself from slamming into Callejon when the Spain winger got sandwiched between the goalkeeper and defender Thiago Motta.\n\nBuffon guessed right on the direction of Insigne's spot kick but the Napoli striker's shot was struck precisely into the bottom corner.\n\nBuffon was making his Champions League debut for PSG, having served a three-match ban for his comments about the referee at the end of Juventus' run last season.\n\nStill viewed as a rival from his Juventus days, Buffon was booed loudly on each touch.\n\nInsigne now has three goals in four Champions League matches this season and 10 in 14 games in all competitions this season.\n\nNapoli captain Marek Hamsik made a record 512th appearance for the club.\n\n\"Napoli mostly tried to keep the tempo down and slow it down in the first half, but then after going behind they changed their approach and poured forward,\" Buffon said. \"There was a period of adjustment after the break, when Napoli came out fighting and it was only natural to be under pressure.

So I leave Milan happy.\"\n\nBarcelona remained top of the group, three points ahead of Inter and six ahead of Tottenham which beat PSV Eindhoven 2-1.\n\n\"It's a good point,\" Icardi said. \"The message from this match is that we want to qualify from the group, we wanted to take points from this match knowing that now we have two difficult matches.\"\n\nInter plays Tottenham next. It managed a late come-from-behind victory at home in its Champions League opener, with Icardi leveling five minutes from time and Matias Vecino netting a stoppage-time winner.\n\n\"Let's hope the same thing happens that happened at San Siro,\" Icardi added with a laugh.\n\nMessi injured his arm in a Spanish league match against Sevilla on Oct. 20 and missed the 2-0 victory over Inter in the last round, but had been training with the team in recent days.\n\nHowever, Messi wasn't even on the bench at San Siro.\n\n\"It was a decision shared by the team,\" Valverde said. \"We had to take care of the footballer especially in a match like this.

He passed a defender and sent a low ball to Filipe Luis, who made a run down the left flank before crossing back toward the middle of the box. Angel Correa let the ball go through, and Niguez came in behind him to fire a low shot into the net. Dortmund defender Manuel Akanji touched the ball in front of the goal line but it wasn't enough to clear it.\n\nAtletico took full control of the game after the first goal and missed several other opportunities to add to the lead during the rest of the first half. It continued to have chances in the second half while Dortmund struggled to get near the goal of Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak.\n\nGriezmann, in his 50th Champions League game, put an end to Dortmund's hopes in the 80th with a soft touch from inside the area as Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki charged from the net after a pass by midfielder Thomas Partey.\n\n\"We controlled the first 20 minutes, had lots of possession, but after we conceded it was a different game. We lost our way a bit after that and it was not our best game,\" Dortmund captain Marco Reus said. \"It was our first defeat and a deserved one. Atletico just don't allow you lots of chances.\"\n\nIn addition to Costa's absence, Atletico also played without defender Diego Godin, midfielder Jorge \"Koke\" Resurreccion and forward Thomas Lemar. At halftime, central defender Jose Maria Gimenez had to be replaced because of a thigh injury.\n\nAtletico didn't get past the group stage last season, ending a run of four straight years making it at least to the quarterfinals. It reached the final twice, both times losing to city rival Real Madrid.\n\nDortmund also disappointed last season, winning only two points in its group and not making it to the knockout round. It had reached the quarterfinals in the previous year.\n\nThe team's 15-match unbeaten run under Favre was the best ever for a Dortmund coach. The team hosts Bayern Munich on Saturday in the Bundesliga.\n\nIn the Champions League, it next hosts Club Brugge on Nov. 28, while Atletico hosts Monaco on the same day.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Saint-Amour, coming off a big game in a win over North Carolina, is a big reason the Yellow Jackets rank among the nation's leaders in turnovers forced as they prepare to play Miami on Saturday. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Tech's spread-option offense has had more help this season in posting big scoring totals.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets' defense has set up a lot of those points with a dramatic jump in takeaways.\n\nGeorgia Tech (5-4, 3-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) has won four of five games, including two straight, as it prepares to host Miami (5-4, 2-3) on Saturday night.\n\nLed by senior defensive end Anree Saint-Amour, the Yellow Jackets' defense has forced 10 turnovers in those four wins, leading to 59 points.\n\n\"When you're more aggressive, you probably get more takeaways,\" coach Paul Johnson said Tuesday.\n\nThe more aggressive defense is result of changes made by first-year defensive coordinator Nate Woody and his 3-4 scheme .\n\nIn 2017, Georgia Tech had only 10 takeaways on defense. Only four of 128 FBS teams forced fewer turnovers.\n\nThis season, the Yellow Jackets have forced 20 turnovers, tied for the eighth-highest total in the nation.\n\nThe sudden jump in big plays caught the attention of Miami coach Mark Richt.\n\n\"Their defense has done a good job with turnovers,\" Richt said, noting the Yellow Jackets \"doubled their number. And in this last game, they picked off three passes and scored 17 points off those turnovers. So they did a great job there.\"\n\nLast week's 38-28 win at North Carolina marked the fifth time this season the Yellow Jackets have forced three turnovers. The takeaways have helped Johnson's offense score 38.3 points per game to rank third in the ACC.\n\nSaint-Amour has three forced fumbles and two interceptions, including one of the three thefts in last week's win. He also has four sacks and 10 \u00bd tackles for loss.\n\n\"I thought he would be a really good player,\" Johnson said. \"I don't know if you ever know he's going to have those kinds of sacks and tackles for negative plays. I think he's a good fit for what we do defensively.\"\n\nSaint-Amour set career highs with nine tackles and three quarterback hurries against the Tar Heels.\n\nGeorgia Tech led 35-28 with less than three minutes remaining when Saint-Amour's leaping interception set up a clinching field goal. On Monday, he was named the ACC's defensive lineman of the week.\n\nSaint-Amour said Georgia Tech has added more emphasis to forcing turnovers this season.\n\n\"In practice we always emphasize takeaways,\" he said. \"Thursday we're always trying to get picks, working on ball skills. Just practicing every day, every week and getting better at it.\"\n\nStill, Johnson is reluctant to heap praise on a defense that has been the Yellow Jackets' chronic weakness. Despite the big plays, the Yellow Jackets rank 78th nationally with their average of 28.2 points allowed. The unit faltered late even in last week's win.\n\nOne weak spot is the team's 13 sacks, good for only 13th among 14 ACC teams.\n\n\"I think Nate has had a pretty good history of creating some turnovers with what they do,\" Johnson said. \"So I certainly don't want to diminish that, but at the same time it's like I can promise you we're not doing anything in practice that we didn't do before. I think it could be a function of maybe we get a little more pressure, but still our sacks numbers are not very good. We do have way more tackles for loss.\"\n\nJohnson also is looking for better results on third down.\n\nThere is room for improvement, but the leap in takeaways is a good start.\n\n\"We know if we want to be a top defense, if we want to be a good defense and we want to win games we have to win the turnover battle,\" Saint-Amour said. \"That's what we try and do.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Thomas Boyd, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe Pacific Northwest appears to be leading the way in the Pac-12 for freshmen running backs who are having an impact.\n\nA trio of talented backs, Oregon State's Jermar Jefferson, Oregon's CJ Verdell and Washington State's Max Borghi, are all taking on notable roles on their offenses as either true or redshirt freshmen.\n\nMeanwhile, Arizona State seems to have cornered the market on freshman defenders. And there's USC's still-could-be-in-high-school quarterback JT Daniels.\n\nAmong the Pac-12 freshmen making a mark this season:\n\nJERMAR JEFFERSON, Oregon State: Jefferson has rushed for 1,092 yards and 12 touchdowns this year. He's had five games with 100-plus yards rushing. But his progress was slowed a bit by injury that kept him sidelined for most of the Beavers' game against California, and USC was able to hold him to 58 yards rushing last weekend.\n\nHe ranks seventh in the nation for rushing yards, averaging 121.3 per game.\n\nCJ VERDELL, Oregon: Verdell leads the Ducks with 690 yards rushing with five touchdowns. He's notable as the Ducks look to re-establish their running game: In the team's loss to Washington State, the Ducks rushed just 58 yards, then in the loss to Arizona they managed just 84. The team vowed to be more physical up front before last Saturday's 42-21 victory over UCLA, where they ran for 200.\n\n\"We made a decision,\" coach Mario Cristobal said. \"The guys, we talked about it and it was about enough is enough; we are going to put our foot on the ground and we are going to recommit ourselves to being the physical team that we started the season as.\"\n\nVerdell is averaging 76.67 yards a game, fifth among freshmen nationally. He rushed for 100-plus yards in his first three conference games.\n\nMAX BORGHI, Washington State: As usual in Mike Leach's Air Raid offense, the Cougars' running backs often do some catching, too, and Borghi is no exception. He has 245 rushing yards for six touchdowns, along with 31 catches for 204 yards receiving and three touchdowns. His nine total touchdowns rank seventh in the Pac-12. He also has forced 10 missed tackles.\n\nLanding Borghi was something of a coup for the Cougars because of a late recruiting push by Stanford.\n\nJT DANIELS, USC: The future looks bright for the Trojans' true freshman quarterback, even if he's had to go through some challenges his rookie year. Daniels has thrown for 1,806 yards with nine touchdowns and seven interceptions. Just 18, he left high school a year early to enroll at USC and become just the second true freshman to start in the opener for the Trojans at quarterback, joining Matt Barkley.\n\nHe missed a game because of a concussion but returned last weekend in a 38-21 victory over Oregon State, throwing for 177 yards and a touchdown.\n\nJEVON HOLLAND, Oregon: The true freshman safety sits atop the Pac-12 with four interceptions this season. He's tied for fourth in the nation and tied for first among freshman. He had two interceptions against Cal. Holland also had an interception in the end zone last weekend against UCLA.\n\nFollowing the victory over the Bruins, teammate Thomas Graham Jr. crashed the postgame news conference to ask Holland how it felt to lead the team in interceptions. \"It feels good. I've got some bragging rights,\" Holland replied before adding with a laugh: \"I may need a ride home; don't leave.\"\n\nMERLIN ROBERTSON, Arizona State: The 6-foot-3, 235-pound linebacker was named Pac-12 defensive Player of the Week following Arizona State's 38-20 upset against then-No. 16 Utah last weekend. Robertson had nine tackles, one for loss, and had his first career interception. Robertson leads the nation among freshmen this season with 27 defensive stops.\n\nArizona State's defense also features a pair of other talented true freshmen, linebacker Darien Butler and defensive back Aashari Crosswell. Crosswell also had an interception against the Utes. Coach Herm Edwards said the guys are nicknamed the fabulous freshmen.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Todd Kirkland) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUBURN, Ala. (AP) \u2014 The Auburn Tigers have rescued a season from the brink and helped make sure coach Gus Malzahn's job is safe in the process.\n\nAthletic director Allen Greene said Tuesday that Malzahn isn't going anywhere after this season.\n\n\"He's our coach for the future,\" Greene said. \"He'll be the coach next year. He's already proven he can get through adversity.\"\n\nMalzahn and the Tigers (6-3, 3-3, Southeastern Conference) have received a jolt of confidence \u2014 and now a vote of confidence \u2014 with two straight wins, including a comeback over Texas A&M .\n\nThey're hoping to build on it heading into Saturday night's game at No. 5 Georgia (8-1, 6-1).\n\nThe Tigers are still two-touchdown underdogs but have won back-to-back games after dropping two straight. They rallied from 10 points down over the final seven minutes to beat the Aggies 28-24.\n\nGreene told reporters after Malzahn's Tuesday news conference that the coach is coming back.\n\nMalzahn was already feeling pretty good about the team's situation after the win over the Aggies.\n\n\"You could tell Sunday, it felt different from a confidence standpoint,\" Malzahn said. \"That's exactly what we needed, that kind of win to help give us some momentum moving forward.\"\n\nThe wins have dramatically changed the mood for a team that has still fallen short of expectations. The struggles, especially on offense, had raised questions about Malzahn's status even though he has a new seven-year, $49 million deal .\n\nThe latest win supplied a big boost. Quarterback Jarrett Stidham led two drives for touchdowns in the closing minutes, capped by his 11-yard pass to Seth Williams for the go-ahead score with 1:41 left.\n\nStidham, who has struggled at times this season, completed 7 of 8 passes for 125 yards over the final two drives.\n\n\"It was a blast,\" he said. \"Being down 10 with about seven minutes left, not many people were counting us in the battle still, so it was good to come back and prove everybody wrong, that's for sure.\"\n\nWith a closing stretch that includes road games against the Bulldogs and No. 1 Alabama, that win made Auburn bowl eligible and left the Tigers needing just one more victory to lock up a winning regular-season mark with Liberty visiting in between the two rivalry games.\n\nThe Tigers made key defensive stops, had a big punt return by Christian Tutt and delivered the two big drives. The big downside was continued struggles running the ball with Auburn producing just 19 yards on 21 carries.\n\n\"All three phases helped win that game when the pressure was on the most and that's really what our team has taken from that,\" Malzahn said.\n\nThis will be the the third time Auburn and Georgia have met over the past year. The Tigers pulled off an upset in the regular season then got routed 28-7 in the SEC championship game rematch.\n\nNow, they're 14-point underdogs but at least feeling better about themselves.\n\n\"I think we're in a good spot moving forward because we got that win,\" Auburn defensive tackle Dontavius Russell said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nBrowns running back Duke Johnson had a season-high 78 receiving yards in Week 9, along with his first two receiving touchdowns. (Photo: Scott Galvin, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe regular season in fantasy football is winding down quickly. In addition to making weekly waiver wire claims, there are trade deadlines to navigate and maybe even some advance planning for those teams that have decent chances to make the playoffs.\n\nRecommended bids based on a free agent acquisition budget (FAAB) of $100 for the season.\n\nBEST BETS\n\nRB Duke Johnson, Cleveland Browns ($18). The big picture doesn't instantly change in Cleveland just because the team fired its head coach and offensive coordinator. However, some smaller things might. Johnson's larger role Sunday (he caught all nine targets for 78 yards and two touchdowns) might be a change that becomes permanent.\n\nRB Mike Davis, Seattle Seahawks ($15). How badly do you need a running back? In the Seahawks' case, pretty badly. Starter Chris Carson played just 10 snaps before reinjuring his hip and taking a seat. That opened things up for Davis, who rushed for 62 yards and caught seven passes for 45 more. He showed earlier in the season he could be the workhorse back (21 carries, 101 yards, 2 TDs in Week 4).\n\nWR Adam Humphries, Tampa Bay Buccaneers ($15). The fourth-year receiver had a season high in catches for the second week in a row. This time, those eight grabs included a pair for touchdowns. Coincidentally, Ryan Fitzpatrick has been under center each of the past two weeks. Consider Humphries the No. 2 wideout \u2014 behind Mike Evans \u2014 in the NFL's No. 1 passing offense.\n\nWR Maurice Harris, Washington Redskins ($13). Harris, who had not hit 50 receiving yards in a game all season, broke out Sunday with 10 catches for 124 yards. Normally, that kind of performance would scream \"fluke!\" However, Paul Richardson is out for the season and Jamison Crowder hasn't played since Week 5. The Redskins need pass-catchers, especially after their offensive line was decimated by injuries.\n\nREPLACEMENTS\n\nUPDATED: WR Dez Bryant, New Orleans Saints ($10). The veteran gives the Saints an immediate red-zone threat \u2014 one who can possibly take some of the heat off No. 1 wideout Michael Thomas. He may take a while to learn the offense, but he gives QB Drew Brees yet another weapon on one of the league's best offenses.\n\nDrew Brees to Dez Bryant pic.twitter.com/FTSgjDxNzP \u2014 Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 7, 2018\n\nWR John Ross, Cincinnati Bengals ($8). It looks like A.J. Green is going to be out several weeks with a toe injury. Ross has been dealing with a groin injury and has played in only one game since Week 4. However, it may be time for him to step forward. He does have two touchdowns among his seven receptions this season.\n\nTE Jeff Heuerman, Denver Broncos ($7). No more Demaryius Thomas means more targets for ... Heuerman? That certainly seems like one takeaway from Sunday's 10-catch, 83-yard effort against Houston. Heuerman has has touchdown catches in back-to-back weeks. The Broncos are one of four teams on bye this week, so he'll be of no use until Week 11.\n\nUPDATED: WR Cordarrelle Patterson, New England Patriots ($6). As has been the case with Ross, Patterson never has seemed to produce when given an opportunity. Who knew his big chance would come as a running back? With Rex Burkhead out and Sony Michel ailing, Patterson has become this season's version of Ty Montgomery. He's also picked up fantasy eligibility at running back in many leagues.\n\nPatterson has double-digit carries in consecutive games for 99 total rushing yards and just this week he ran for a touchdown. Michel could be back this week ... or could be held out and return after the bye. Patterson's a decent one-week stopgap, but the Titans defense is no pushover.\n\nWR Curtis Samuel, Carolina Panthers ($5). His 33-yard touchdown on a reverse was a thing of beauty \u2014 and he also caught at TD pass. However, those were two of his three total touches in the game. D.J. Moore is still a better overall pickup.\n\nSPECULATIVE PICKUPS\n\nQB Nick Mullens, San Francisco 49ers. It's not unprecedented for an unknown quarterback to come in and be a difference-maker late in the season. Remember Billy Volek? Mullens was fantastic in his first NFL start, throwing for 262 yards and three TDs on Thursday against the Raiders. The odds are against Mullens repeating that performance, but he does have the Giants and Buccaneers sandwiching a Week 11 bye. Dare to dream!\n\nRB Rashaad Penny, Seattle Seahawks. Penny split time with Davis after Carson left the game against the Chargers. As has been the case all season, he didn't do much with those touches \u2014 24 total yards on four carries and three receptions. Only add him in deep leagues.\n\nPossibly still available from last week's list: WR D.J. Moore, TE Jack Doyle, QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, RB Josh Adams, RB Elijah McGuire\n\nFollow Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner", "LeBron James has completed his first 10 games with the Lakers, and it hasn\u2019t exactly been the dreamiest start for the new-look Lakers.

Right is right and wrong is wrong. My parents raised me better than that.\"\n\nAccording to Weehawken police accounts, Lauletta, the Giants' fourth-round pick from Richmond, was driving his 2017 Jaguar on Tuesday morning, Oct. 30, when he was stopped for failing to obey a police officer's order to continue driving straight.\n\nThe report says Lauletta almost hit a police officer while making an illegal turn. He was stopped by a second police officer and refused to produce a driver's license or exit the car.\n\nThe incident happened close to renovations near the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects New Jersey with midtown Manhattan.\n\nPolice say he was arrested and charged with eluding police, obstructing administration of law and resisting arrest. He was also charged with reckless driving, disregarding an officer's directions, improper turn and failure to remain in a marked lane.\n\nPolice said Lauletta's car was involved in a similar incident Monday, but summons were mailed because the vehicle did not stay at the scene.\n\nThe Giants were on their bye week, so he did not have to report to any organized practices until Tuesday.\n\nAfter practice, Lauletta said he was apologetic about the incident.\n\n\"I understand the cops have a very tough job and it was very chaotic at that location,\" Lauletta said. \"I respect these officers and I can't say that I'm sorry enough. I have to prove myself worthy through my work ethic and put it all behind me. That's all I can control and I hope to move forward from this.\"\n\nGiants coach Pat Shurmur said that Lauletta will not face any suspension for his actions.\n\n\"It's being handled internally,\" Shurmur said. \"I'm very disappointed with the way it went down. I spoke to Kyle and this is not the way we want our players to act. The whole incident is disappointing. He's back to work today and we'll deal with it.\"\n\nShurmur said that Lauletta's problems with the police stemmed from him being late for meetings prior to practices both Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\"The way I look at it, quarterbacks should be early,\" Shurmur said. \"He's working to be in a position to play. There is a lot to learn in order to prepare to play in the NFL.\"\n\nLauletta said that he immediately spoke with Shurmur after his arrest.\n\n\"I know he was disappointed and I know I can't put myself in that situation again,\" Lauletta said. \"I have to deal with the consequences.\"\n\nIn other quarterback news, Shurmur also said that Eli Manning will remain the starter for Monday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\"He's starting Monday with the idea that he is going to get us on a run here and win some games,\" said Shurmur, whose team is 1-7.\n\nVeteran Alex Tanney has been listed as the No. 2 quarterback on the Giants' depth chart all season. There was a possibility Lauletta would be given the opportunity to start a few games once the Giants were out of playoff contention. Now, Lauletta's chances to start have greatly diminished with this arrest.\n\n\"The first thing I thought of was that I was leaving (home) later that I should have,\" Lauletta said. \"It's my fault. I will take this as a lesson. I can't put myself in these situations moving forward. I don't know if I'm worried about (not getting the chance to play). I can't afford to worry about it. I just have to do everything I can to prove that I can play. I'm going to give it everything I have, keep my head down and keep moving forward.\"\n\nLauletta said that he did not want to \"talk about the details of the incident,\" especially after he was asked about going through the same traffic pattern illegally two days in a row.\n\n\"I was wrong,\" Lauletta said. \"I know that. It's a horrible feeling. I stand with what happened. I made a decision I'll regret for the rest of my life. I have to show up early every day from now on. Hopefully, this all will be part of my past and I'll never allow what happened to happen ever again. I woke up late and put myself in that situation.\"\n\nLauletta said that he has spoken with Manning about the incident.\n\n\"Eli has always been supportive of me,\" Lauletta said. \"He's there for me. Right now, my goal, my main focus is to help Eli.\"\n\nNOTES: The Giants announced that rookie defensive tackle R.J. McIntosh, the team's fifth-round draft pick out of Miami, has been cleared to play and will be activated in time to play Monday night. A roster spot will have to be created for McIntosh, who has been on the team's non-football illness list. McIntosh's illness has yet to be addressed. ... Shurmur also said that offensive guard Jamon Brown, acquired via waivers from the Los Angeles Rams last week, will more than likely be activated and see action. Brown could actually be a starter at guard if he can learn quickly in practice this week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gary Cameron, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) \u2014 Maryland interim coach Matt Canada faces an uncertain future, despite keeping the football team together and forging a winning record amid the chaos surrounding the program.\n\nWhen this season ends, Maryland will be looking for a head coach to replace DJ Durkin, who was fired last week. Canada may be asked to apply, given that he's juggled the job of interim coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach well enough to keep the Terrapins (5-4, 3-3 Big Ten) in the hunt for a bowl bid entering Saturday's game at Indiana (4-5, 1-5).\n\nOr, Canada could end up unemployed if the school hires a coach who wants someone else to run the offense.\n\nIf any of this has been weighing on Canada's mind, he's not telling. Asked Tuesday if he's considered what the future might bring, Canada completely dodged the issue.\n\n\"Our focus is on today, on each other, on being able to do the best we can against Indiana,\" he said. \"It's probably not the answer you're looking for, but it's a true answer.\"\n\nThe football program has endured a myriad of deflating events since late May, when offensive lineman Jordan McNair collapsed on the field and subsequently died of heatstroke. There have been two internal investigations, one into McNair's death and the other into the culture of the program .\n\nDurkin was placed on administrative leave in mid-August. Canada took over, handed back the reins last Tuesday when Durkin was reinstated and regained control when Durkin was fired the following day .\n\nAll this preceded a rather predictable 24-3 loss to Michigan State.\n\n\"There were some different events \u2014 we're going to be honest about that \u2014 but we went through them, our kids processed them,\" Canada said. \"We just didn't play well enough to win the game Saturday.\"\n\nCanada has never been a head coach. Although he's fulfilling that job description this season, the 46-year-old considers himself to the offensive coordinator with a few other obligations. The biggest change is that he no longer views the game up in the coach's booth.\n\n\"I've been presented with a few things that I wasn't expecting. Calling from the field has been a different challenge,\" he said. \"I try to find the good in everything, and there's a lot of good.

I always wanted to be a coach. There was no doubt about that. I wasn't sure how it was going to work out.\"\n\nNow, 24 years later, Canada is the acting head of the Maryland football team. Upon accepting the job as interim coach, he called Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley to ask how shift between calling the plays and directing the team.\n\n\"I got some great advice. He told me, 'Just make sure you stick to what you're supposed to be,'\" Canada said. \"I'm supposed to be the offensive coordinator, so that's what I've done. I've tried to be around the players, make sure they knew I was there, but I've focused on being the quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. Some days I've done OK, some games I haven't done very good at all. That's my biggest issue with how this has gone.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The San Francisco 49ers are sticking with Nick Mullens as their starting quarterback after his spectacular debut performance.\n\nMullens said coach Kyle Shanahan told him Tuesday that he will remain the starter for the upcoming game against the New York Giants.\n\n\"We discussed it. Obviously the situation is what it is,\" Mullens said. \"The team is ready to get to work and treat it like any other week. My preparation doesn't change and this team's preparation doesn't change. We're excited to keep things going.\"\n\nMullens worked with the starters during a limited practice as the 49ers (2-7) prepare for the Monday night game against New York. C.J. Beathard remains in the backup role after losing the starting job because of an injured wrist.\n\nMullens was sharp in his debut, after spending his first year-plus in the NFL on the practice squad as an undrafted free agent out of Southern Mississippi.\n\nMullens completed 16 of 22 passes for 262 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions for a 151.9 passer rating in a 34-3 victory over the Oakland Raiders. That's the highest since the merger for a player in his debut with at least 20 attempts.\n\nMullens also joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly (1986) and Fran Tarkenton (1961) as the only QBs to throw for at least 250 yards and three touchdowns without throwing an interception in their NFL debuts.\n\nThat performance earned Mullens plenty of praise, especially on social media. But he spent the weekend enjoying time with his family rather than basking in the praise.\n\n\"It was a great experience but it's obviously onto the next week as this week is,\" he said. \"One week doesn't make a season so you have to keep things rolling.\"\n\nMullens provided a big lift to a 49ers team that had lost six straight games heading into the game against the Raiders and had little to play for after a season-ending knee injury to starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo in Week 3.\n\nBeathard had committed 10 turnovers in his five starts, falling to 1-9 in his career as a starting quarterback.\n\nBut that all changed in one game with Mullens under center, even though it came against one of the NFL's worst defenses.\n\n\"He came in that first drive and it seemed like he had been in there the whole time,\" tight end George Kittle said. \"That's all on him. The preparation he's done and how he's been ready for it. It seemed like he's been ready all season.\"\n\nIn other injury news, cornerback Richard Sherman practiced despite being limited the past few weeks by injuries to his heel and calf. Linebacker Reuben Foster (hamstring) and receiver Pierre Garcon (shoulder, knee) were rehabilitating on the side, while safety Jaquiski Tartt (shoulder) did not practice.\n\nThe 49ers will take a day off on Wednesday before coming back for the regular week of preparation on Thursday for the game against the Giants.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Victoria Will)\n\nMeg Tilly has taken on her most intriguing role to date: that of romance author.\n\nThe Golden Globe-winning actress is no stranger to the written word. She has published several novels, most of them young-adult, since 1994.\n\nBut in \"Solace Island\" (Berkley, 294 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four), Tilly finally indulges in what she refers to as her \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d by writing the kind of romance novel she has \u201cdevoured\u201d since she was a teen. Not a \u201cliterary tome.\u201d Her words, not ours. And while we agree this is no literary tome, it most definitely is a guilty pleasure. Our words, not hers.\n\n(Tilly originally released the novel digitally through Sweetberry Press in April 2017 under the pen name Sara Flynn.)\n\n\"Solace Island\" opens with bride-to-be Maggie Harris being dumped by fiance Brett at her own bachelorette party, only days before the wedding. Sadly, a clean break is not in the cards, because Brett is also Maggie\u2019s business partner. Devastated, Maggie gives Brett an ultimatum: Buy half the company or she will sell her controlling shares to someone else. Brett balks, Maggie leaves.\n\n\"Solace Island\" by Meg Tilly. (Photo: Berkley)\n\nMaggie then travels from Arizona to the aptly named Solace Island for a few weeks of vacation with her sister Eve, an artist living in New York City. Located in the Pacific Northwest, Solace Island is an eclectic mix of local artists and hipsters. It's the charming and picturesque town of Comfort \u2013 where everything is locally sourced, farm-to-table and organic \u2013 that Maggie and Eve retreat to.\n\nOn Solace Island, Maggie runs into Luke Benson \u2013 a Special Forces operative turned security specialist turned bread baker \u2013 who, it seems, has an equally tragic romantic past. Not long after she arrives, Maggie\u2019s life is threatened, and Luke\u2019s past re-emerges as he comes to her aid and sets out to find out who wishes her harm.\n\nWhat ensues is a romantic thriller with a clever ending. You may think you know exactly where the story is going, but looks, and people, can be deceiving.\n\nThere are of course the usual romance novel tropes, most notably the leading man\u2019s constant state of arousal whenever he is around our feisty heroine. But isn\u2019t it those cheeky conceits that make a true romance such a guilty indulgence? We think so.

Hernandez said he was spurred to become a citizen after watching the nation's politics change.\n\n\"It was easy,\" he said speaking in Spanish through a translator as cattle trucks roared past. \"It was my first time and I was a little nervous, but I wanted to vote because now I'm a citizen.\"\n\nActivists warned for weeks that voters like Hernandez might struggle to vote in Dodge City after elections officials moved the city's longtime and only polling location 3 miles away, a mile outside the city boundary. Officials said road construction \u2013 which hasn't started \u2013 prompted the move.\n\nA voter shows off his \"I voted today\" sticker after casting his ballot in the midterm elections in Dodge City, Kan., on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, Trevor Hughes-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nHernandez tried to vote at the old location on Tuesday morning, only to be intercepted by a small army of volunteers and voting-rights advocates who happily drove him and his wife to the new site. City and county officials also provided buses from the old site, along with free door-to-door rides for workers.\n\n\"We're getting this taken care of,\" said Jose Vargas, 56, a longtime Dodge City resident who helped lead efforts to reach Hispanic voters, and who voted early so he could dedicate Election Day to helping others. \"He'll get to vote.\"\n\nAlong the brick-paved streets of Dodge City and around the country, voting-rights advocates say Republican officials desperate to maintain power are improperly depressing turnout, especially among minorities who tend to vote for Democrats. President Donald Trump and other Republican officials say tough voting requirements are needed to ensure that only documented voters exercise the hard-won right to vote.\n\nElections officials across the country say they've never seen evidence of widespread voter fraud, and say the real problem is that so many Americans just don't vote, a problem exacerbated by obstacles both obvious and subtle. One of the most pernicious problems, experts say, are long lines that dissuade impatient voters in the moment and for years into the future.\n\nHere in Ford County, Vargas said, the move was just one of many small and subtle ways in which government fails to adequately consider the needs of Hispanics, who are 60 percent of the city's residents, drawn to southwestern Kansas for the steady jobs at the slaughterhouses and beef packing plants along the Santa Fe Trail. Vargas owns a company that helps Hispanic residents with their taxes and other paperwork, and said he believes the polling site move was done deliberately to disenfranchise his community.\n\n\"Dodge City is a prime example but it is one of just hundreds or thousands of places that have these issues,\" said Jessica Reeves, chief operating officer of Voto Latino, a national Hispanic-focused voting-rights group co-founded by actress Rosario Dawson. \"This is happening all over the country and, unfortunately, nobody else is getting this kind of attention.\u201d\n\nNot everyone in Dodge City who was eligible planned to vote this year.\n\nBy 2 p.m., Luis Saenz hadn\u2019t yet voted.

Tapia\u2019s sister, who is also a documented permanent resident, said Hispanic voters need to speak up for their community.\n\n\u201cA lot of Hispanic people don\u2019t think like our president, and if Hispanic people voted, things could change,\u201d said Jocelin Olivera, 38.\n\nVaughan Nash waits in the pre-dawn darkness to vote in Dodge City, Kan., during the Nov. 6, 2018, midterm election.

Justice Department officials said they were too busy to answer questions, and declined to permit a reporter to monitor their Dodge City election supervision efforts on Tuesday. In a statement, Ford County Administrator J.D. Gilbert said he and all the county's election workers are committed to ensuring everyone gets to vote: \"We do not have a big team, but we have a strong team and we have been quiet for a reason \u2013 because we have work to do.\"\n\nBattles over voting access around the country have been fiercest where Republicans and Democrats are locked in tight election battles, including here in Kansas where the state's top election official, Kris Kobach, is running for governor against Laura Kelly, a strong Democratic opponent. Decreased Democrat turnout favors Kobach in this traditionally Republican state. Kobach claimed there was widespread illegal voting by undocumented U.S. residents.\n\nRenee Lopez of San Diego flashes \"V\" signs encouraging people to vote during a get-out-the-vote event on Nov. 6, 2018, in Dodge City, Kan.

Straight ticket voting allows voters to fill in just one box on the ballot for either all Democrats or all Republicans.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions in a statement said the Justice Department was committed to making sure people who are allowed to vote can: \u201cAny attempts to interfere or subvert our democratic process by foreign or domestic entities will be met with severe consequences.The American people can be confident that their voices will be heard.\u201d\n\nIn Dodge City, Sarah Heeke, 34, said the news coverage made her hometown sound a lot worse than it really is. Heeke, a lawyer, said she voted without a problem and didn't anticipate anyone else having trouble. Still, she said the media interest has sparked an appropriate conversation about who votes. According to the Pew Center on the States, as many as 51 million Americans \u2013 24 percent of us \u2013 are eligible but aren't even registered to vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad for the national attention. So much emphasis has been put on voting in Dodge City, and hopefully, it will ultimately increase voter turnout,\" Heeke said, who brought her son, Bennett, 6, so he could see the process.\n\nCount first-time voter Jackie Diaz, 21, as someone feeling the pressure to vote.

They last played in the European Cup in 1991 as holders, when beating the likes of Liverpool would not have been regarded as such a surprise.\n\nBack then, eastern European teams were genuine contenders for club football's biggest prize \u2014 Steaua Bucharest of Romania was European champion in 1986 \u2014 and Red Star had some of the world's best players like Robert Prosinecki and Dejan Savicevic.\n\nNearly three decades on, Red Star doesn't have a household name in its squad and needed to qualify for the group stage through the playoffs. It was also thrashed 4-0 by Liverpool at Anfield in the previous round when the gulf between the sides was huge.\n\nTwo weeks later, Red Star \u2014 playing in front of a loud and passionate home crowd \u2014 kept Liverpool's fearsome attacking unit quiet and, in Pavkov, had its own star striker.\n\nHe leapt highest at a corner to head in a right-wing delivery from Marko Marin and put Red Star ahead. Pavlov then showed another side of his game, shrugging off Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum to get the ball onto his right foot and smash a fierce shot past goalkeeper Alisson from 25 meters.\n\nDaniel Sturridge, who started up front for Liverpool in place of Roberto Firmino, sidefooted over the bar from close range in the first half and Mohamed Salah saw his shot strike the post after halftime. A deflected cross from Liverpool left back Andrew Robertson also bounced onto the crossbar after the break in Belgrade.\n\nThe English club has now lost both of its away games in the group stage, having been beaten 1-0 at Napoli last month. Napoli and Liverpool both have six points after the Italian team's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in Naples later Tuesday.\n\nRed Star moved onto four points and its home form means it still has a chance of a top-two finish. Red Star drew 0-0 with Napoli in its previous home game.\n\nLiverpool finishes the group with a trip to PSG and a home game against Napoli.\n\n\"You can't give teams that start,\" Liverpool midfielder James Milner said. \"The crowd is big for them and it's been a long time since they've been in the Champions League. Napoli found it tough when they came here and we knew it was going to be a tough place to come.\n\n\"We need to win our games, it's on our shoulders ... it's in our hands but we will have to play better than we did tonight.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Can you send us a photo of you with your sticker?\n\nWe know what Democrats want tonight: an Election Day House party. The current minority party in both houses of Congress, the Democrats hope to win at least 23 seats to flip the House and two seats to take the Senate. The oddsmakers say Republicans have a good chance to keep their Senate majority, but holding onto control of the House will be a long shot.\n\nAnd who's bracing himself as this all goes on? President Donald Trump, of course.\n\nPolls have indicated that voters on both sides are fired up and turnout is expected to be high for a midterm election that most are calling a referendum on Trump.\n\nWhile we prep for what's sure to be a busy night and enjoy another slice of Election Day pizza, we're shaking up the usual newsletter format to tell you what to watch for:\n\nThe House races\n\nNancy Pelosi seemed pretty confident of Democratic victory on Tuesday.

If they all start turning blue, there is a good chance that trend will continue as the polls close in the West.\n\nHere are five races that could determine how the House shakes out.\n\nThe Senate seats\n\nFor Republicans to lose control of the Senate, Democrats would have to defend all 26 of their seats that are up for grabs and steal two from the GOP (or some scenario that nets them at least two seats). The pollsters at FiveThirtyEight only put the odds of the Democrats pulling that off at 19.5 percent.\n\nThere are three races in the East where Democrats are in tough re-election fights: Florida, Indiana and West Virginia. If they lose even one of those, it could kill their chances. If they drop two or more, Senate Republicans can go ahead and open the champagne.\n\nGovernors' races\n\nStacey Abrams could become the first African-American woman to win a gubernatorial race in U.S. history.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Iowa entered the season's midway point looking like the most skilled team in the Big Ten West.\n\nConsecutive road losses to Penn State and Purdue have left the Hawkeyes likely playing just for pride and a decent bowl bid.\n\nIowa (6-3, 3-3 Big Ten), which has often been known for getting the most out of oft-modest talent under longtime coach Kirk Ferentz, sits at just .500 in the league and out of this week's Top 25 despite a cadre of future pros on its roster.\n\n\"The biggest thing for us moving forward right now is moving forward. That takes mental toughness. We can't be looking back or worry about the what-ifs,\" Ferentz said. \"Circumstances are always changing...it really gets down to your ability to focus on what's important.\"\n\nThe Hawkeyes, whose point differential remains higher than the team that was 9-0 at this point three years ago, hosts Northwestern (5-4, 5-1) on Saturday. They're favored to win by 10 points \u2014 despite trailing by two games in the standings \u2014 in a last-ditch effort to remain relevant in the West.\n\n\"We just want to play our best football,\" senior Iowa defensive end Parker Hesse said. \"I think it's a testament to this team that we've stuck together. We've had two really tough losses in a row now. But no one is pointing fingers. No one is looking to blame anyone else.\"\n\nThese Hawkeyes might be one of Ferentz's most gifted teams, but they're also one of his most frustrating given that all three of their losses were winnable late in the fourth quarter. A few penalties that could've gone either way didn't help their cause in last week's 38-36 loss at Purdue.\n\nBut Iowa has put itself in such last-minute peril in part because it can't run the ball \u2014 and thus control the tempo \u2014 like it has in the past.\n\nThe Hawkeyes have three sophomore running backs who've looked at times like solid Big Ten starters. But they're also just 79th nationally with 157 yards a game on the ground.\n\nIt's not like Iowa hasn't tried to establish the run, attempting about 40 rushes a game. But the Hawkeyes' paltry 3.9 yards per carry \u2014 and the fact that they've yet to spring a back for a 100-yard game \u2014 has put extra pressure on junior quarterback Nate Stanley to carry them.\n\nStanley has just one TD throw in his last two games after a recent stretch of 14 in just four.\n\n\"We want to strive for 4.5 (yards per carry). Or at least four,\" center Keegan Render said. \"There are just a couple of (missed assignments) that you can't have this late in the season.\"\n\nIowa's defense has hit a rough patch after a strong start too, allowing 30 points in a six-point loss to the Nittany Lions and 38 last week at West Lafayette. Even though the Hawkeyes still rank second-best in the Big Ten in scoring defense, those performances prompted a team meeting by that unit \u2014 one led by its senior leaders.\n\n\"I think some young guys, after two straight losses, they kind of lose sight of what we're trying to do, which is to go to work every day and get better and win games,\" end Sam Brincks said.\n\nDespite the fact that bragging rights and a sunny postseason trip are likely all the Hawkeyes have left on the table, there's a strong possibility that they'll end the regular season on a high note.\n\nAfter hosting the Wildcats, Iowa might also be a double-digit favorite in its last two games \u2014 at Illinois and at home against Nebraska on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"We're only three, four possessions away from being undefeated. So, it just comes down to finishing,\" safety Amani Hooker said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It isn\u2019t like Jimmie Johnson wrecking himself and Martin Truex Jr. feet away from the finish line. It isn\u2019t even like Joey Logano nudging Truex out of the way for the win, as we saw two weeks ago.\n\nNo, this is is Aric Almirola being furious with Logano for\u2026 racing him? If that sounds ridiculous, it is, but let\u2019s break down what happened in the Round of 8 of the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs.\n\nWhen did this all start?\n\nBefore the AAA Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway on Sunday ended up extending into overtime, there were multiple restarts in the final laps, including with 32 laps to go in the originally scheduled race length. Logano \u2014 who already locked himself into the Championship 4 race in a couple weeks at Homestead-Miami Speedway \u2014 was racing near Almirola, a championship hopeful.\n\nLogano\u2019s No. 22 Ford was on the outside of Almirola\u2019s No. 10 Ford, and they were close to each other but it doesn\u2019t look like they were banging the sides of their cars against each other. As Logano moved to pass Almirola, the 10 car got loose and slid up the track while Logano took off. Almirola dropped back and lost multiple track positions.\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s what happened.\n\nLogano finished third behind winner Kevin Harvick \u2014 who\u2019s now also guaranteed a place in the championship event \u2014 and Ryan Blaney. Almirola was eighth and enters the final elimination event before the championship race 57 points below the cutoff line and will advance only with a win Sunday.\n\nSo why is Aric Almirola so mad?\n\nBasically, he thinks because Logano had already guaranteed his spot in the championship race, he shouldn\u2019t race other people hard. For some reason, despite being surrounded by ultra-competitive drivers for 36 races of the year, he thought it was more appropriate for Logano \u2014 or perhaps anyone else \u2014 to give his competition a break on the track. OK, sure.\n\nThere was no contact, there wasn\u2019t a purposefully caused wreck. There was racing \u2014 a ludicrous thing to expect during a NASCAR race, apparently.\n\nWhat did Aric Almirola say after the race?\n\nAlmirola, who started Sunday\u2019s race at the back of the field, criticized Logano for not giving him a break on that restart. He told NBC Sports:\n\n\u201c(We) worked diligently all day to get up to the front and finally got ourselves in position to at least have a shot with those guys, and (Logano) just went down in Turn 3 and put it right on my door and about wrecked us both. So I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ll have to talk to him. \u201cBut he just continues to make things harder on himself. If that is the way he wants to race me when he is already locked into Homestead and we are out here fighting for our lives, that is fine. When Homestead comes around if I am not in, he will know it.\u201d\n\nWhat did Joey Logano have to say?\n\nNothing. Wisely, neither Logano or anyone from his team elected to comment about the situation after the race.\n\nDoes anyone feel this criticism is warranted?\n\nNot really. Aside from NASCAR promoting quotes from an angry Almirola, no one really thinks complaining about another driver racing during a race is justified. These guys are professional athletes, and they didn\u2019t get to the level they\u2019re at without being competitive at every turn \u2014 literally.\n\nBy Almirola\u2019s logic, Kevin Harvick deserves criticism for racking up seven regular season wins when he should have just been satisfied with earning one and qualifying for the playoffs. Same with Kyle Busch and his six regular season victories.\n\nWhy did Chase Elliott need to win two of the three races in the previous Round of 12 in the playoffs when one win automatically advanced him to the next round? See how ridiculous this is\u2026\n\n\"I don't need to hear any more of that. This is racing.\"@DaleJarrett responded to Aric Almirola's comments on the way he was raced by Joey Logano late. #NASCARPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/XwCcoaYI6o \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) November 5, 2018\n\nHere\u2019s what NASCAR Hall of Famer Dale Jarrett had to say about Almirola\u2019s complaint:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear any more of that.

Rules officials around the world have little time to learn a new set of rules effective Jan. 1. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSlugger White spent three weeks in Asia as the lead rules official for PGA Tour events. He is officiating in Mexico this week at the Mayakoba Classic, and then he heads to Australia the week of Thanksgiving for his final event of the year, the World Cup.\n\nAnd then? He has four weeks to get up to speed on the largest overhaul of rules in golf history.\n\nWhite is among hundreds of rules officials worldwide who face a crash course on the modernized Rules of Golf that take effect Jan. 1. The modernized rules, which took more than five years to develop, were announced in early March. But the majority of officials did not get a head start on studying the changes for fear they might rely on 2019 rules at 2018 tournaments.\n\n\"There's so many differences,\" White said Tuesday from Mexico. \"We've kind of tugged along on little things, but on a weekly basis, we don't want to confuse ourselves. The embedded ball is going to be different next year. It's one club length. Now it's drop as near as you can.\"\n\nTour officials typically go to USGA rules workshops in the fall, and they've had half-day seminars every four years to go over any changes to the Rules of Golf. Now, however, officials from various tours plan an intensive two-day session with the USGA the second week in December.\n\nWhite said the USGA would be at five PGA Tour events to start next year.\n\nThe modernized rules were developed to make them easier to understand and to apply. Among the more drastic changes are penalty drops from knee-high height (instead of shoulder height) and eliminating penalties for balls that move accidentally on the green or clubs that touch the ground in a hazard. Also, players will be allowed to leave the pin in the hole while on the green and repair spike marks.\n\nMissy Jones on the LPGA Tour finished up the qualifying series last week and, like White, said she didn't study the new rules sooner because \"it's hard to look at those and officiate under 2018 rules.\"\n\nShe recalled one instance when a player removed a boundary stake that was impeding her swing.\n\n\"I was thinking that next year she would have a chance to put it back (before hitting her shot),\" Jones said. In this case, the player was docked two shots.\n\nThe toughest aspect for rules official is adapting to 24 rules instead of 36. They could recite rules by numbers, and that will make it particularly difficult on someone like White, who has been a rules official for 37 years.\n\n\"An unplayable ball is no longer (Rule) 28,\" White said. Next year that falls under Rule 19.\n\nJones said recreational golfers won't have to worry about citing numbers, and the modernized rules will be easier to understand.\n\n\"For us, it's erase the hard drive and start over,\" she said.\n\nAnd it's not just them. Jones said she handed out a 16-page booklet with highlights of the major changes to players in the scoring area at the LPGA qualifying series last week. The PGA Tour plans to distribute information and videos to players after its year ends Nov. 18 at the RSM Classic.\n\nMUSICAL CHAIRS\n\nJustin Rose had reason to celebrate his second time reaching No. 1 in the world because he got there by winning the Turkish Airlines Open.\n\nBut the celebration is short.\n\nBrooks Koepka replaces him at No. 1 next week with neither of them playing. And thus continues what amounts to musical chairs atop the world ranking in 2018, the most volatile \u2014 for now \u2014 since 1997.\n\nRose, Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas have taken turns at No. 1 this year, the most since Greg Norman, Tom Lehman, Tiger Woods and Ernie Els each got to No. 1 during 1997. There were eight changes at the top in 1997, and next week will be the eighth change in 2018.\n\nThere could be more.\n\nKoepka has one more tournament this year. He defends his title in the Dunlop Phoenix on the Japan Golf Tour on Nov. 15-18. Rose is expected to play two more events, the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas the week after Thanksgiving and his title defense in the Indonesia Masters in Jakarta on Dec. 13-16.\n\nThey are the only two who can reach No. 1 the rest of the year. Johnson is not expected to play again until Kapalua, and Thomas would appear to be too far back even if he wins his final event of the year in the Bahamas.\n\nUS OPEN QUALIFIER\n\nThanks to the change in the PGA Tour schedule, players now can qualify for the U.S. Open in four countries.\n\nThere already was a 36-hole sectional qualifier in England for European Tour players and in Japan for players from various Asian tours. Because the Canadian Open is the week before the U.S. Open next year, the USGA is scouting golf courses near the Toronto area to have a 36-hole qualifier on the Monday ahead of the Canadian Open.\n\nPreviously, that qualifier was held in Memphis, Tennessee, ahead of the FedEx St. Jude Classic, which next year becomes a World Golf Championship in late July.\n\nFATHERS AND SONS\n\nJim Furyk's father is the only coach he has ever had. Mike Furyk now gets to be his partner.\n\nFuryk is among four newcomers to the PNC Father-Son Challenge, which will be held Dec. 15-16 at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida. Others playing for the first time are Darren Clarke and David Toms with their sons, and Matt Kuchar with his father.\n\nPlayers must have won a major or The Players Championship to be eligible, and their partner must not hold a PGA Tour card. Davis Love III is playing with his son, Dru, who has played 11 times on the PGA Tour on sponsor exemptions as he starts his career.\n\n\"My entire golf career has been a family affair and my dad has been there every step of the way,\" Furyk said. \"He has taught me so many lessons about life and my golf swing, so to have this opportunity to team up with him is nothing short of a dream come true.\"\n\nAngel Cabrera and his son, Angel Jr., are the defending champions.\n\nJack Nicklaus returns with this grandson, G.T., who in April gave his grandfather one of his greatest thrills by making a hole-in-one during the Par 3 Tournament at the Masters. They also played as a team last year.\n\nThe 20-team field features 11 players in the Hall of Fame, including Retief Goosen, who will be inducted in June.\n\nDIVOTS\n\nDustin Johnson has signed up to play in Abu Dhabi for the third straight year. ... No player from among the top seven in the Race to Dubai is playing the Nedbank Challenge, a Rolex Series event and the penultimate tournament in the Race to Dubai. ... Abraham Ancer tied for fourth in Las Vegas and became the first Mexican golfer to crack the top 100 in the world ranking. Ancer is at No. 98 going into the Mayakoba Golf Classic in Mexico. ...

With the right system, the Cowboys offense would be a top-10 unit. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not even a league-average unit, and nobody deserves more blame than Jason Garrett \u2014 though the argument can be made that Jerry Jones deserves blame for allowing his head coach to waste a number of talented teams over the last decade.\n\nAfter a lifeless 14-point performance in a Monday night loss to the Titans, it\u2019s become abundantly clear that Jones needs to make a coaching change. I\u2019m not even sure what Garrett is bringing to the table at this point. He can\u2019t manage a game. His X\u2019s and O\u2019s leave plenty to be desired. And he seems to be more interested in keeping his buddy Scott Linehan around than he is in winning games.\n\nReally, the Cowboys\u2019 offensive problems can be traced back to the promotion of Linehan as offensive coordinator before the 2015 season. He replaced Bill Callahan, who also served as the team\u2019s offensive line coach, after Washington poached him away from Dallas. Well, that probably isn\u2019t the most accurate description of how Callahan and the Cowboys parted ways. He was essentially forced out of Dallas. He was stripped of play-calling duties in 2014 and then blocked from interviewing with the Browns and Ravens for their offensive coordinator jobs. When his contract expired in Dallas after 2014, he fled as soon as possible.\n\nIt was a big win for the Redskins. Callahan is considered by many to be the best offensive line coach in the NFL after he helped build Dallas\u2019 imposing offensive line. Under his watch, LT Tyron Smith, C Travis Frederick and RG Zack Martin developed into all-pro performers. In 2014, the Cowboys line emerged as the league\u2019s best. It helped DeMarco Murray lead the league in rushing and allowed Tony Romo to put up career-best numbers.\n\nSince Callahan\u2019s move to Washington, the Cowboys\u2019 line has been in decline while the Redskins\u2019 line, when healthy, has been among the best in the league. That\u2019s no coincidence.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say whether Callahan would have stuck around in Dallas had the front office treated him a little better than they did, but Callahan left for the same position in Washington. Had he been a little happier, and better compensated, that would have been a harder move to make.\n\nMaybe Jones gave himself too much credit for drafting guys like Smith, Frederick and Martin and believed that his scouting eye had more to do with the success of the Cowboys line than Callahan\u2019s coaching did. It\u2019s now clear that isn\u2019t the case. Dallas has acquired two highly-touted line prospects, La\u2019el Collins and Connor Williams, in the time since Callahan left. Williams has struggled throughout his rookie season, and Collins has yet to harness all of his physical gifts and develop into a useful player.\n\nAnd the Cowboys are missing more than Callahan\u2019s developmental skills. During his time in Dallas, Callahan also served as \u201crun game coordinator.\u201d Well, the Cowboys\u2019 run game isn\u2019t being coordinated very well right now.\n\n.@dallascowboys are in real trouble. Let\u2019s be clear. No one in the @NFL runs this \u201ccounter trey\u201d without controlling the backside DE. In fact, no one in Texas HS Football runs this play.

The Cowboys are still lining up in condensed formations and attempting to overpower teams. It just doesn\u2019t work without an elite offensive line. It\u2019s an utterly futile strategy with a middle-of-the-pack offensive line, and that is what we\u2019re seeing in Dallas in 2018. In an age where offensive coaches are finding ways to create space, the Cowboys are doing the opposite to play to a strength that isn\u2019t nearly as strong as it once was.\n\nThe Cowboys now seem to understand the importance of an offensive line coach. Before their bye week, they fired line coach Frank Alexander and replaced him with Mark Colombo. Alexander hadn\u2019t been on the job for long. He took over in the offseason for the fired Frank Pollack, who was Callahan\u2019s original replacement. The team is now on its third offensive line coach in 10 months.\n\nDallas can continue playing musical chairs with its offensive line coach position, but it\u2019s not going to find another coach like Bill Callahan who can come in and save Garrett and Linehan from themselves. If Jones wants the Cowboys offense to get back to where it was a few years ago, he\u2019ll need to make wholesale changes to the offensive coaching staff, starting at the top.", "Camille Kostek \u2014 a former New England Patriots cheerleader, host, actor and now a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model \u2014 and Rob Gronkowski have been dating since around 2015, when a photo of the pair appeared on Instagram.\n\nNow, we got an inside look at their relationship thanks to an interview she did recently in which she didn\u2019t hold back when asked questions about Gronk, including about whether they\u2019ll get engaged soon.\n\nWhen asked if the Patriots tight end was \u201cas big of a party monster as he seems,\u201d Kostek had this to say to Improper Bostonian:\n\nNo. Let\u2019s put it this way: When he parties, he parties, and he definitely lives up to the reputation.

I haven\u2019t paid attention in three weeks.\u201d\n\nGossiping about work, even trashing a co-worker, is behavior everyone, who has ever worked anywhere in their entire life has done. This is basically the only reason people go to post-work happy hours. So they can complain incessantly about everyone they work with. It\u2019s the foundation of every work place, even if your work place is an NHL rink.\n\nIn their defense, the Senators also have every right to complain. Their organization is in shambles, team moral is low, and their PK really does stink! Teams always demand unflinching unity and loyalty, but these players are also human. Sometimes, you just have to vent, and a dark Uber is as good a place as any.\n\nWhile this is embarrassing for the players at the moment, it might end up being a net positive for the entire team. Studies have shown that gossiping, even negative gossip, can have a positive effect.\n\nPer The Atlantic, complaining about coaches can actually build team unity.\n\nResearchers at the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma found that if two people share negative feelings about a third person, they are likely to feel closer to each other than they would if they both felt positively about him or her.\n\nAlso, while gossiping is often dismissed as petty or counter productive, it can actually cause people to be more reflective and think about their own behavior.\n\nA team of Dutch researchers reported that hearing gossip about others made research subjects more reflective; positive gossip inspired self-improvement efforts, and negative gossip made people prouder of themselves. In another study, the worse participants felt upon hearing a piece of negative gossip, the more likely they were to say they had learned a lesson from it.\n\nThere are also studies that say that hearing negative gossip about yourself, in the case of Raymond, can cause improvement. Again, from The Atlantic.\n\nNegative gossip can also have a prosocial effect on those who are gossiped about. Researchers at Stanford and UC Berkeley found that once people were ostracized from a group due to reputed selfishness, they reformed their ways in an attempt to regain the approval of the people they had alienated.\n\nVenting frustration, as the players did, is a natural response to stress and can bring people closer together. The only shame here is that an unscrupulous third party released the video to the public.", "MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Natisha Hiedeman made five 3-pointers and scored 21 points, reigning Big East player of the year Allazia Blockton scored 15 of her 19 points in the second half and No. 19 Marquette beat South Dakota State 91-52 on Tuesday in a season opener.\n\nMarquette returned all five starters from last season's team that reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament \u2014 its latest exit since 2011.\n\nHiedeman hit 4 of 7 3-pointers in the first half and Isabelle Spingola made all three of hers to help Marquette build a 44-25 halftime lead.

(Photo: Vadim Ghirda, AP)\n\nNow that the U.S. Olympic Committee has started the process to revoke recognition from USA Gymnastics as the national governing body for the sport, questions remain about the organization\u2019s future and the path forward for the athletes. Here\u2019s what we do know:\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nUSA Gymnastics has not yet lost its recognition as the NGB for the sport, but the USOC\u2019s action on Monday starts a process that could \u2013 and likely will \u2013 lead to that. The USOC will select a three-person panel, which will be chaired by a USOC board member and include a representative from the NGB council and athlete advisory council.\n\nAt a hearing that panel will hold, USA Gymnastics will have the opportunity to \"present factual evidence and legal argument regarding the allegations of the complaint,\u201d according to the USOC bylaws.\n\nMore: US gymnasts deserve better, USOC CEO Hirshland says. And she's right\n\nMore: USOC begins process of revoking USA Gymnastics' status as NGB\n\nThe panel will issue a report to the USOC board of directors afterward and make a recommendation on what action the board should take. USOC CEO Sarah Hirshland can also submit a report to the board. The USOC board will issue a final decision.\n\nUnder the USOC\u2019s bylaws, there is no timeline for the process.\n\nWhat does that mean for current gymnasts?\n\nThe American women qualified their spot for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 by winning team gold at the world championships last week. While the USOC\u2019s action cast uncertainty on the organization\u2019s future, Hirshland assured gymnasts that the USOC would continue to support them.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure support for the Olympic hopefuls who may represent us in Tokyo in 2020,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThat includes Simone Biles, who claimed six medals at the world championships in her return to international competition.\n\nUntil USA Gymnastics loses its recognition, it can continue to run its elite programs. The women largely train with their individual coaches and convene for national team camps, which have been few this year, while the men run a residency program at the Olympic training center in Colorado Springs and also meet for camps.\n\nIf USA Gymnastics loses its recognition, the USOC will work to recognize another NGB for the sport. The USOC puts forth the teams for the Olympics, but the NGB would have to be up and running to run a selection process to choose those teams.\n\nWhat will happen to USA Gymnastics?\n\nThat\u2019s unclear. Even without USOC recognition, the organization could continue to operate competitions. In that scenario, it would lose its power and cache as being the pipeline to Olympic competition and likely at least some of its membership.\n\nThe organization could also fold. It has been in mediation with the victims of Larry Nassar\u2019s abuse since the spring, and it has sued its insurers to cover its liability. USA Gymnastics lost all of its sponsors and is in a much more difficult financial position. It\u2019s possible the organization could file for bankruptcy.\n\nWhat's next for gymnasts competing internationally?\n\nUSA Gymnastics has a team competing in the world trampoline and tumbling championships, beginning Wednesday in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nNational teams for artistic gymnastics are entering a down-time in their schedules, with no major competitions until next year. The American Cup is scheduled for March 2 in Greensboro, N.C.\n\nWhat's the reaction from the gymnastics community?\n\nOlympic gold medalist Aly Raisman, who has been an advocate for sexual abuse victims, says she's in favor of the USOC's actions. \"Change is not easy, and the unknown can be scary, but we need to do whatever it takes to ensure nothing like this ever happens again,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nTo the gymnastics community \ud83d\udc97 pic.twitter.com/JQZKsWrVyl \u2014 Alexandra Raisman (@Aly_Raisman) November 6, 2018\n\nTwo-time Olympic medalist Jonathan Horton said he's also pleased with the USOC's move Monday. \"Now, we can really come together as a community and make this sport the way we want it,\" Horton tweeted.", "'Me Voting in 2016 versus Me Voting in 2018': How we really feel about the midterms\n\nA screenshot of a tweet using the meme 'Me Voting in 2016 versus Me Voting in 2018.'

(Photo: Sue Ogrocki, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Three years after narrowly upholding lethal injection in executions, the Supreme Court appeared troubled Tuesday that it could cause \"gruesome and brutal pain\" for a Missouri prisoner with a rare medical condition.\n\nDespite two lower court rulings upholding the state's plan to execute convicted murderer Russell Bucklew by lethal injection, a slim majority of justices seemed likely to send the case back for further review, including consideration of alternate methods.\n\nSuch a decision would expose a potential problem with the high court's 2008 and 2015 decisions upholding lethal injection. In the latter case from Oklahoma, the court's conservative justices ruled that the method must be shown to be riskier than a known alternative.\n\nBucklew, 50, has proposed the use of nitrogen gas, a method that has not been tested in any state, rather than those used in recent years: electrocution in Tennessee and firing squad in Utah. The state argues its one-drug lethal injection is safer.\n\n\"Are you saying even if the method creates gruesome and brutal pain, you can still do it because there's no alternative?\" new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who may hold the deciding vote, asked State Solicitor D. John Sauer. \"Is there any limit on that?\"\n\nBucklew was convicted of murder, rape and kidnapping in 1996 and has not challenged his conviction or death sentence. Instead, he claims that a rare and incurable condition that causes blood-filled tumors in his throat, neck and face creates the risk of extreme pain and suffocation.\n\nMissouri convicted murderer Russell Bucklew is fighting for the right to be executed by lethal gas, rather than lethal injection. (Photo: MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS / HANDOUT, EPA)\n\nThe high court blocked his execution twice before, first in 2014 following a series of botched lethal injections in other states, and again last March. The most recent action was by a 5-4 vote, with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy siding with the court's four liberals.\n\nKavanaugh succeeded Kennedy last month following a contentious confirmation battle that he won 50-48. It was not a surprise that on Tuesday, both lawyers continuously pitched their arguments in his direction.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in 2015 that Oklahoma could use a more controversial, three-drug lethal injection protocol because challengers had not proven it would not mask excessive pain and had not identified a better alternative. That decision, written by Associate Justice Samuel Alito, prompted Associate Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg to suggest that capital punishment itself might be unconstitutional.\n\n\"While most humans wish to die a painless death, many do not have that good fortune,\" Alito wrote in 2015. \"Holding that the Eighth Amendment demands the elimination of essentially all risk of pain would effectively outlaw the death penalty altogether.\"\n\nDuring Tuesday's oral argument, Alito appeared most dissatisfied with Bucklew's challenge. Told by his attorney, Robert Hochman, that nitrogen gas would be a quicker death than lethal injection, Alito said, \"What are the numbers? And where does that come from?\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts expressed concern that Bucklew's chosen alternative has never been used, even though several states authorize it.\n\n\"Things can go wrong regardless of the method of execution,\" he said. \"And it seems to me that if you have a method that no state has ever used, that that danger is magnified.\"\n\nIn the 2015 case, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the principal dissent for the four more liberal justices, charging that the ruling \"leaves petitioners exposed to what may well be the chemical equivalent of being burned at the stake.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Breyer raised both that specter and the feeling of being \"drowned to death slowly over a period of time.\" He asked whether Missouri was arguing such pain and suffering should be allowed.\n\n\"The Constitution would rule out burning at the stake, absolutely,\" Sauer said.\n\nMore: Supreme Court says state and local governments can be sued for age discrimination regardless of size\n\nMore: Supreme Court's latest church-state conundrum: Must a 'peace cross' memorial to World War I vets come down?\n\nMore: Supreme Court divided over Google class-action deal that rewarded lawyers, nonprofits ... but not customers\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/06/death-penalty-supreme-court-wary-lethal-injection-ill-prisoner/1903405002/", "", "FILE - In this Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, file photo, Maryland quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome, center, is tackled by Michigan State's Joe Bachie, right, in the second half of a NCAA college football game in College Park, Md.

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Who was trying to influence your vote in the midterm elections? On Facebook, it was not always easy to find out.\n\nPolitical advertisers are required to fill in a field that says who paid for the message in your news feed, but that does not necessarily tell you who they or their backers are.\n\nEntities can write whatever they want in that field as long as it's not deceptive or misleading. A growing number of Facebook ads in the run-up to the election took advantage of that loophole to obscure or conceal the identity and political motives of who paid for them \u2013 and Facebook did not catch it. That allowed some Facebook pages to remain anonymous while stirring political discord.\n\nTake a Facebook page called Defending Donald, which spent $14,535 on 94 political ads, reaching hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users. Some were pro-Trump ads such as this one that was displayed to Facebook users as many as 200,000 times: \"The House and Senate have done a horrific job backing up the president on protecting pre-existing conditions.\" But the Facebook page itself sometimes sent mixed political signals. Read one post: \"Trump: Laughingstock of UN.\"\n\nThe disclaimer on the ads said they were paid for by the Facebook page, with no indication of who was behind the Facebook page or who was behind an affiliated website by the same name.\n\nSome Facebook users who felt tricked by ads into visiting the Facebook page vented their frustration in the comments. \"This site, Defending Donald, is a scam people,\" wrote one. \"It's a liberal site.\"\n\nThe administrator of the Facebook page, which has 17,000 followers and was created in June, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlerted by USA TODAY, Facebook said it has requested \"appropriate verification,\" such as a Federal Election Commission number or employer identification number, from the purchaser of the Defending Donald political ads.\n\n\"We've disapproved these 'paid for by' disclaimers and their ads until the person paying for them provides the appropriate verification,\" Facebook said in a statement.\n\nFacebook doesn\u2019t try to verify who's behind every political ad, but political advertisers must accurately represent themselves, and most of them do, the company says. When Facebook identifies potentially deceptive or misleading disclaimers, it investigates and may remove them. Facebook says it's exploring \"additional checks\" to prevent abuse.\n\nAfter ads on the social network were used to spread disinformation and divisive Russian propaganda during and after the 2016 presidential election, Facebook tightened its policies around political ad buying.\n\nAny people or groups who want to buy political ads on Facebook are required to verify their identities and prove they have a mailing address in the U.S. The ads, whether they are targeted at political campaigns or discuss issues of national importance, are kept in a searchable database for seven years, offering a rare glimpse into how political campaigns target Facebook users.\n\nFamilies for Trump, with 11,000 followers, also created in June, is another Facebook page buying up political messaging to lure Facebook users, spending $10,516 on 57 ads. But the Facebook page doesn't always offer up the pro-Trump posts that those Facebook users expect.\n\nOne post on Families for Trump claimed Republican tax cuts had failed to help families. Another post commented: \"This seems to be a growing sentiment among many swing voters regarding healthcare\" on an article written by a swing voter who leaned Republican but changed her mind over the treatment of preexisting conditions.\n\n\"What exactly is this?\" one bewildered Facebook user asked in the comments.\n\n\"Fake Trump account that the filthy Democrats use to gain votes,\" another Facebook user responded.\n\nFamilies for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFacebook pages hawking ads that target Democrats or Republicans then bombard them with messaging from the other side of the aisle proliferated in the weeks before the midterm elections, according to Damon McCoy, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering.\n\n\"Groups create these disingenuous, grassroots-looking communities on Facebook, and you can't trace these damn things,\" he said. \"There are so many of them, we can't even catalog them all. They are popping up left and right.\"\n\nA Facebook Elections sign. (Photo: John Minchillo, AP)\n\nThe Daily Beast uncovered newly incorporated limited liability companies secretively backing a network of Facebook pages to carry out attacks on Republican policies, donors and candidates. The Atlantic tracked the network to a media industry veteran Dan Fletcher, who runs a company, MotiveAI.\n\nAn anti-Ted Cruz page called Crush Cruz, which did not offer any information on who was behind the push to reach Texas voters, was uncovered by CNN Business. Twice the news outlet caught the page violating Facebook's rules. Facebook missed both violations. The New York Times exposed anonymous attack ads in a competitive race in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District.\n\nLack of regulation of political ads on digital platforms leaves it up to individual social media companies to decide how much or little political ad buyers are required to disclose.\n\nFacebook does not disclose the identity of political ad buyers. Under Federal Election Commission rules, political committees must disclose digital ad spending in public filings, but there are no set rules for disclosures on digital platforms such as Facebook.\n\nMore: Facebook discloses possible election meddling by Russia, foreign actors on eve of midterms\n\nMore: Facebook uncovers Iran disinformation to sow political discord over Trump, race\n\n\"Paid for by\" disclaimers are reviewed before and after they run to make sure they comply with Facebook's policy, which prohibits vague or inaccurate representations of the entity paying for the ad, the company says.\n\nAds that reference or feature political candidates or current officials may require additional information to run on Facebook. Facebook says it also may request the Federal Election Commission or tax identification numbers if an ad is reported or identified as inaccurate or misleading.\n\nAn election war room in the company's Menlo Park, California, headquarters monitors these kinds of issues to identify patterns so Facebook can crack down on offenders. Facebook says it is also working with election authorities to flag potentially problematic ads.\n\nBut, it says, there is no comprehensive source where it can verify registered political groups at the national, state and local level. And, Facebook points out, its disclosure policy applies to ads about political issues, not just candidates, unlike Google which only tracks ads about federal candidates or officeholders. Issue ads on television also don\u2019t require a disclaimer.\n\nLike Facebook, Twitter requires a disclaimer for ads about political candidates and issues. But Twitter verifies advertisers through their Employer Identification Numbers.\n\nMcCoy, one of the researchers behind NYU's Online Political Ads Transparency Project, says Facebook's political ad system \u2013 and the archive that compiles political ads for seven years \u2013 has increased transparency and accountability.\n\n\"It's an improvement. Before, we didn't see this mess,\" he said. \"At least Facebook is making this mess transparent to us.\"\n\nFaith in Facebook's new political advertising system has been rocked in the weeks leading up to the midterms. Vice got approval to buy fake Facebook ads on behalf of Vice President Mike Pence, the Islamic State and 100 U.S. senators. Business Insider bought fake Facebook ads that it wrote were paid for by Cambridge Analytica, the now defunct political consulting firm that was banned by Facebook for exploiting the personal information of millions of Facebook users without their consent. ProPublica identified ad campaigns from industry lobbying groups that obscured who was behind them.\n\nThe growing laundry list of problems has lawmakers calling on Facebook to tighten its protocols. \"If Facebook is going to claim to verify who\u2019s paying for political ads, they need to actually do the work,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement.\n\nFacebook has also been criticized by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who co-sponsored the Honest Ads Act along with Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. That legislation, which is being backed by Facebook and Twitter, would increase disclosure requirements for online political ads.\n\nMore: Russian Facebook ads inflamed Hispanic tensions over immigration after Trump election\n\nMore: We read every one of the 3,517 Facebook ads bought by Russians.

But if you have a deep bench, you can free up a spot to speculate on a player who might help you in the fantasy playoffs and get to a name long before other teams do.\n\nLet\u2019s run through a few players to speculatively grab now:\n\n1. RB Malcolm Brown, Los Angeles Rams\n\nThis is particularly for contending Todd Gurley owners: He\u2019s your insurance policy if Gurley sits with an injury or if the Rams end up sitting their prized star a bit later in the season if they clinch the top seed in the NFC. Plus, for dynasty leaguers, he\u2019s talented! Look at this crazy touchdown he scored last week:\n\n2. RB Spencer Ware, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nIf you own Kareem Hunt, of course. But even if you\u2019re not contending, now\u2019s the time to grab handcuffs like this one.\n\n3. QB Jameis Winston, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nIt\u2019s possible he\u2019s on your waiver wire after getting benched and replaced by Ryan Fitzpatrick. But we\u2019ve seen the coaching staff in Tampa change its mind before, and if the Bucs aren\u2019t contending by December, maybe they give Winston a chance again to prove he\u2019s not a bust. His future matchups include games against the 49ers, Panthers and Saints. If you have room on your bench and you\u2019re streaming quarterbacks this year, he might help.\n\n4. TE Hunter Henry, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nESPN reported his return from a torn ACL is a \u201clongshot.\u201d But you know the tight end position is terrible this year, so why not take a chance and stash a player who caught eight touchdowns two years ago?\n\n5. RB D\u2019Onta Foreman, Houston Texans\n\nI\u2019ve been touting him all season as a stash, and I\u2019ll still do it now \u2014 despite two back-to-back big games for Lamar Miller, he just put up a dud against the Broncos. What if Foreman returns from injury and shows explosiveness out of the backfield? It\u2019s worth a shot.\n\n6. WR James Washington, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe rookie could be Antonio Brown insurance.\n\n7. RB Ronald Jones, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nHe was starting to work his way into the offense before a hamstring injury sidelined him. Maybe if Peyton Barber continues to disappoint, the second-rounder is given more of a role when he returns to full health.", "News from around our 50 States", "Dallas Cowboys fan holds up a sign to fire head coach Jason Garrett during the fourth quarter against the Tennessee Titans at AT&T Stadium. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys stink right now.\n\nHow bad are things in Dallas? A Titans player celebrated by dancing on the star as the Cowboys dropped to 3-5 with a 28-14 loss on Monday night.\n\nOwner Jerry Jones said the team has \u201cto recognize reality,\" and the reality is, something needs to change. The Cowboys haven\u2019t won the Super Bowl \u2014 or the NFC, for that matter \u2014 since 1995. In the last 10 years, they won but three NFC East titles and just two playoff games.\n\nThe Cowboys' struggles got us thinking: Who are some other blueblood teams having troubles, and who will be the first to achieve that elusive title?\n\nNotre Dame football\n\nWhen a program that claims 11 national titles is known most for a movie from 1993 about a walk-on player, something\u2019s wrong. The Fighting Irish haven\u2019t won a football title in 30 years and are 5-8 in bowl games since 2000.\n\nYes, the Fighting Irish are 9-0 and ranked No. 3 in the Amway Coaches Poll. But what happened last time we lauded Notre Dame? Alabama rolled 42-14 in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game. The Irish have won three bowl games in five years since, though we can't forget one of those wins was against Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl.\n\n\u25ba Title handicap: This Notre Dame team is different, but the road to a title is a bumpy one. This week's game vs. Florida State should be a win, but the final two games \u2014 against No. 13 Syracuse at Yankee Stadium and at USC \u2014 might be difficult. Notre Dame can make the playoff, where Clemson and Alabama will almost assuredly be waiting. With a little help from Touchdown Jesus, Notre Dame has more than a prayer's chance to earn a long-awaited title.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James. (Photo: Brad Rempel, Brad Rempel-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCoach Luke Walton didn't have high expectations in 2017-18 when he was guiding one of the youngest teams in the NBA to a playoff-less season. But since LeBron James has arrived \u2014 even if the preseason chatter was about how shaping a contending team would take time \u2014 patience already is waning and pressure on Walton and this franchise to reach the playoffs is rising. That's because James likely came to Hollywood wanting Year 2 in Los Angeles to be a banner season.\n\nThe Lakers are 4-6 in a loaded Western Conference, and the sense of urgency has much to do with mediocrity for the past five losing seasons, which included the franchise's worst record (17-65 in 2015-16).\n\n\u25ba Title handicap: The veteran players that arrived in the offseason are more about helping the young cast of Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma mature. The reasons the Lakers are one of the most likely to have the quickest turnaround are LeBron James and the 2019 offseason, when this team figures to land a top-tier free agent. James chose L.A. for many reasons, but it was really a chess move about the future that he bought into with president Magic Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka.\n\nManchester United\n\nIf you\u2019re a sports fan that doesn\u2019t follow soccer, chances are you\u2019re familiar with the name Manchester United. The Red Devils, one of the most successful clubs in soccer history, have won more trophies than any other English team, including a record 20 Premier League titles and three UEFA Champions League titles. In 2018, Forbes valued United at $4.8 billion, the most valuable soccer club in the world.\n\nThough it has been only six years since United\u2019s last Premier League title, that might as well be an eternity. The last time United went five-plus years without a Premier League title was its 26-year drought from 1966-1992.\n\n\u25ba Title handicap: United has world-class talent at every position, including the bench, so that isn\u2019t the reason for the lack of success. Jose Mourinho, one of the most successful managers in soccer history, was hired in 2016 and led the club to a second-place finish last season. Under Mourinho, United has consistently played down to opponents and currently sits seventh on the Premier League at 6-2-3. With three clubs atop the league without a loss, United\u2019s return to glory may have to wait another year or two.\n\nMontreal Canadiens\n\nMontreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price. (Photo: Jean-Yves Ahern, Jean-Yves Ahern-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe franchise with a record 24 Stanley Cups last reached a conference final in 2014 and has not hoisted a championship trophy since 1993. The Canadiens failed to make the playoffs and finished with the fourth-worst record last year (29-40-13), seeming poised for a rebuild.\n\n\u25ba Title handicap: This year's team (8-4-2) still has franchise goalie Carey Price and a solid coach in Claude Julien, as well as some young players \u2014 including newly acquired center Max Domi and rookie Jesperi Kotkaniemi \u2014 who have started to show signs of promise. So the future might not be that bleak.\n\nTennessee women's basketball\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to replace a legendary coach such as the late Pat Summitt, who took control of the Lady Volunteer\u2019s program at age 22 in 1974. The Hall of Fame coach guided Tennessee into the NCAA and helped make it one of the most dominant and respected programs in college athletics.\n\nSummitt officially turned the program over to assistant Holly Warlick after being diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease during the 2011\u20132012 season (she died in 2016). Since Summitt\u2019s departure, the Lady Vols have made the NCAA tournament each year under Warlick but have failed to advance further than the Elite 8. The last two seasons, Tennessee finished fifth and tied for fourth in the conference, respectively, and were bounced in the Round of 32 both years.\n\n\u25ba Title handicap: It's been 10 years since the Lady Vols won back-to-back titles, and though they're still competitive, the landscape has changed greatly. UConn hasn\u2019t won the in last two years but is still the team to beat. As for their competition, the Lady Vols have been surpassed by Notre Dame, South Carolina, Baylor and Mississippi State. Though a title might not be too far off, it's definitely not too close, either.\n\nUCLA Bruins men's basketball\n\nCoach Steve Alford finds himself on the coaching hot seat even though he has missed only one NCAA tournament and has three Sweet 16s in his five-year tenure in Westwood. Last year the Bruins (21-12) barely squeezed into the NCAA field as a bubble team, and that is the type of result that frustrates an impatient fan base. Alford thasn\u2019t exactly failed at UCLA, but he also hasn\u2019t flourished \u2014 which is part of the job security equation at a blueblood program that has 11 national championships, 10 of which came in the John Wooden era.\n\n\u25ba Title handicap: Alford brings in another strong class, but his coaching chops will have to measure up to his recruiting. Another Sweet 16 would help silence doubters, and the Pac-12 is wide open. But he doesn't feature a roster that can make it to April. A Final Four has eluded this program since 2008. Its last title was '95.", "By: Nick Schwartz | November 6, 2018 2:06 pm\n\nAll betting lines via William Hill.\n\n7:00 p.m. ET \u2013 No. 10 Michigan State vs. No. 1 Kansas, ESPN Point spread: Kansas -6 \u00a9 AP Photo/Orlin Wagner\n\n7:00 p.m. ET \u2013 Towson at No. 5 Virginia, ACC Network/WatchESPN Point spread: Virginia -14.5 \u00a9 Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\n7:00 p.m. ET \u2013 Lenoir Rhyne at No. 6 Tennessee, SEC Network/WatchESPN Point spread: Not set \u00a9 AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez\n\n7:00 p.m. ET \u2013 No. 8 North Carolina at Wofford, ESPN 2 Point spread: North Carolina -5 \u00a9 AP Photo/Gerry Broome\n\n7:00 p.m. ET \u2013 Morgan State at No. 9 Villanova, FS1 Point spread: Not set \u00a9 Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\n7:00 p.m. ET \u2013 Eastern Washington at No. 16 Syracuse \u2013 ACC Network/WatchESPN Point spread: Syracuse -17.5 \u00a9 AP Photo/Nick Lisi\n\n7:00 p.m. ET \u2013 The Citadel at No. 22 Clemson \u2013 ACC Network/WatchESPN Point spread: Clemson -25.5 \u00a9 Joshua S.

Then, there are some who believe it's more beneficial to have them grab a cap and a clipboard and take it all in from the sideline. (AP Photo/Ralph Freso, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Start them right away? Ease 'em in? Have them sit a whole season?\n\nWhen it comes to developing young quarterbacks in the NFL, it all depends on who you talk to.\n\nSome teams think it's best to throw rookie QBs into the fire to learn on the job. Others prefer to gradually work them into the offense. Some say it's more beneficial to have them grab a cap and clipboard and take it all in from the sideline.\n\n\"I think every position is the same,\" Jets offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates said. \"If someone can't handle it mentally, then you don't want to put them on the field, because naturally they'll play slower and be thinking instead of reacting.\"\n\nSam Darnold clearly passed that test for New York, and the No. 3 overall pick in April was under center to start the season.\n\n\"If a player shows the athletic ability, the talent and has the mental capacity to handle a gameplan and go into a game and be successful,\" Bates said, \"then he's ready to play.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean things have necessarily gone smoothly for the former USC star.\n\nDarnold's 14 interceptions lead the league and have contributed to the Jets' 3-6 start. So have his 55.0 percent completion rate and 68.3 quarterback rating, which also rank among the worst in the league.\n\nStill, some point to these early struggles as crucial building blocks for the future.\n\n\"I'm going to continue to learn,\" Darnold said Sunday after a 13-6 loss at Miami in which he threw four INTs. \"There's always lessons to be learned.\"\n\nOf the 32 quarterbacks currently listed as starters for their teams, 12 were under center in Week 1 of their first season.\n\nOn the flipside, some veteran superstar QBs waited a while before they got their chances.\n\nAaron Rodgers was stuck behind Brett Favre in Green Bay before finally starting in his fourth season. Philip Rivers didn't start with the Chargers until his third year, when Drew Brees went to New Orleans. Even Brees didn't get his first NFL start until his second season.\n\nTom Brady, Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Alex Smith weren't Day 1 starters, either.\n\n\"In an ideal world, it gets to be like Drew, who had a chance to watch a little, or Tom Brady and Aaron,\" said former quarterback Rich Gannon, the 2002 NFL MVP and now an analyst for CBS Sports and SiriusXM NFL Radio.\n\nPatrick Mahomes sat behind Smith in Kansas City until Week 17 as a rookie last year, and now is a leading MVP candidate as one of the NFL's top gunslinger s with a league-leading 29 TD passes for the 8-1 Chiefs.\n\n\"We knew that Patrick was very talented, but any time that an NFL team goes with a young quarterback, usually it's a very challenging endeavor,\" Chiefs owner Clark Hunt said. \"Sometimes it takes time, several years, but as we've seen, Andy (Reid) had Patrick ready to go Week 1.\"\n\nGannon thinks the Chiefs provide the perfect blueprint.\n\n\"Mahomes had a chance to watch a master of his domain for a year,\" he said. \"Alex Smith knew that system inside and out, has great huddle command and leadership skills. Maybe he doesn't throw it like Mahomes does, but this is a guy who was willing to share and help him for that year, and we're seeing the fruits of it now.\n\n\"That's the best situation you can have.\"\n\nAgain, that depends on who you ask.\n\nIn the past three drafts, 11 quarterbacks were taken in the first round \u2014 including Darnold, Cleveland's Baker Mayfield, Buffalo's Josh Allen, Arizona's Josh Rosen and Baltimore's Lamar Jackson this year.\n\nJackson is the only one to not yet start at least one game. Baltimore has Joe Flacco leading the huddle, but Jackson has still been used in the offense and is the Ravens' second-leading rusher.\n\nThe Browns wanted to have Mayfield, the No. 1 overall pick this year, sit and learn behind Tyrod Taylor. But like most plans in Cleveland, it backfired.\n\nTaylor got hurt in Week 3 and Mayfield was thrust into the lineup, helping the Browns rally to beat the Jets in a nationally televised game and end a 19-game winless streak. Mayfield has shown poise and promise, but lacks playmakers and is dealing with a coaching change after Hue Jackson was fired.\n\nIn Buffalo, the Bills weren't anticipating Allen starting in the second week. They were taking what coach Sean McDermott called a \"calculated\" approach. But after AJ McCarron was traded before the season opener and Nathan Peterman bombed in Week 1, McDermott was left with no choice but to turn to Allen.\n\nThe rookie has been dealing with a sprained right elbow , and is uncertain to play Sunday against the Jets.\n\n\"When you draft a quarterback like we did, there's a part of it where you have to say, 'Hey, he's going to play either A, B, or C \u2014 early, middle, or late or next year.'\" McDermott said. \"You have to be OK with all of that.\"\n\nThe initial plan in Arizona was to have Rosen learn behind Sam Bradford. All that changed when the veteran was ineffective and benched in favor of the No. 10 overall pick.\n\nRosen took his lumps with some turnover-filled performances. Then, Mike McCoy was fired as the Cardinals' offensive coordinator and Bradford was later cut \u2014 leaving the job to Rosen.\n\n\"His demeanor allows him to have success,\" new offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich said. \"Quarterbacking in this league is hard and when things go bad, this kid tends to be fine.\"\n\nBut, some say too many adverse situations could end up having long-term deleterious effects on a young player.\n\n\"When you put them in before they're ready, they also get hurt: Josh Allen, Josh Rosen,\" Gannon said. \"The speed of the game is way too fast for them. ... Or they have a bad experience, like what wound up happening with (the Jets') Mark Sanchez and Geno Smith, or going back to Ryan Leaf (with the Chargers). They play right away before they are physically or mentally ready or maturity-level ready. They get benched and booed and maybe run out of town, the coach gets fired, and then the next thing, they're on their third or fourth team. They think he will be a savior and he's not ready to play.\n\n\"How is that being responsible from a coach and ownership standpoint? It's doing a tremendous disservice.\"\n\nTampa Bay's Jameis Winston and Tennessee' Marcus Mariota started right away after being the top two picks in 2015, but the jury's still out on both.\n\nFor those who preach patience, 25 of the 32 current QBs started a game at some point in their rookie season. And, several held on to the job from there.\n\nQuarterbacks such as the Rams' Jared Goff (No. 1 in 2016) and the Bears' Mitchell Trubisky (No. 2 in 2017) started and struggled as rookies, but benefited from changes in coaching staffs and philosophies and took leaps in their second seasons.\n\nSo, who's right?\n\nWell, all of the above.\n\n\"There's certainly valuable experience when you stand and watch,\" McDermott said. \"But we all know there's no substitute for the experience when you're actually behind the wheel. There's a lot of value to that.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Barry Wilner and AP Sports Writers Bob Baum, David Ginsburg, Dave Skretta, John Wawrow and Tom Withers contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

After eight straight wins, the Saints got the better of the Rams and beat them 45-35 on Sunday at the Superdome. It was a hard-fought game that was back and forth most of the day, but the Saints prevailed thanks to a 72-yard touchdown late.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad for Los Angeles, of course, as there were some valiant efforts. Here\u2019s how we graded every position from Sunday\u2019s loss.\n\nQuarterback\n\nRegardless of who you want to pin the loss on, don\u2019t let it be Jared Goff. even though the Rams didn\u2019t win, Goff had one of his best games in the NFL. He completed 28 of 40 passes for 391 yards, three touchdowns and one interception, going toe-to-toe with Drew Brees all game long.\n\nHe made eye-popping throws and good decisions with the football, consistently fitting passes into tight windows. Even his interception was more of a great play by the linebacker than a poor throw. He missed his target by mere inches, which would\u2019ve made for a 15-20-yard gain to Robert Woods.\n\nJared Goff didn\u2019t miss this throw by much. Just a great play by Alex Anzalone, who\u2019s a terrific athlete. pic.twitter.com/sWJ1YZpBvk \u2014 Cameron DaSilva (@camdasilva) November 6, 2018\n\nGrade: A-\n\nRunning back\n\nPut simply, Todd Gurley didn\u2019t have a great game, and it\u2019s not necessarily his fault. The Saints said afterward that they keyed on stopping him, knowing they couldn\u2019t take away all of the Rams\u2019 weapons. He mustered just 79 yards on 19 touches, including 11 yards on six receptions. The Rams tried to get him going in a variety of ways, but it was to no avail.\n\nHe was good in pass protection, however, as was Malcolm Brown. The backup also made a spectacular play to score a touchdown down the left sideline, tiptoeing into the end zone. It wasn\u2019t a terrible game by the running backs, just not one we\u2019re used to seeing. That\u2019s what happens when you face the league\u2019s No. 1 run defense.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nWide receiver\n\nBrandin Cooks played well against his former team, catching six of eight targets for 114 yards and one touchdown. Cooper Kupp added five catches and 89 yards, scoring a long touchdown on a crossing route. Robert Woods only caught five of the nine passes that came his way, but he had 71 yards receiving and made several nice grabs.\n\nThey were the only three receivers to catch a pass and really the only three wide receivers to play meaningful snaps, but they performed as they often do.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nTight end\n\nDon\u2019t look now, but this was one of the best games Gerald Everett and Tyler Higbee have had together. They combined for five catches and 88 yards on nine targets, including plays of 20 and 33 yards. Higbee was also solid in pass protection, allowing no sacks and very little pressure when asked to block. He did have a bad drop on a great throw, though.\n\nJared Goff was really, really good against the Saints. Tiny window and a perfect throw under duress. pic.twitter.com/5VJ6jUzXbH \u2014 Cameron DaSilva (@camdasilva) November 5, 2018\n\nGrade: B\n\nOffensive line\n\nAnytime a quarterback goes an entire game without being sacked, the offensive line likely played well. That was the case on Sunday as Goff was hit just five times and hardly faced any pressure in the pocket. Rob Havenstein handled Cameron Jordan and with the exception of one bull rush by Sheldon Rankins, Rodger Saffold held up well, too.\n\nGrade: A\n\nDefensive line\n\nOnly one player for the Rams hit Drew Brees on Sunday and that was, you guessed it, Aaron Donald. He hit Brees four times despite failing to record a sack, generating the majority of the little pressure the Rams put on the future Hall of Famer. Ndamukong Suh and Michael Brockers didn\u2019t do much, either, as the Saints rushed for 141 yards.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nInside linebacker\n\nMark Barron struggled in this one as he was beaten a few times in coverage, while also missing his share of tackles \u2013 a problem for seemingly every Rams defender Sunday. Cory Littleton was better, but even he was burned for a big play to Benjamin Watson after failing to keep up with him in coverage. His play on the goal line to stuff Zach Line was phenomenal, however, and saved a touchdown.\n\nThis play by Cory Littleton was fun to watch. Fights through the designed picks to make the stop. pic.twitter.com/3cbN4NervQ \u2014 Cameron DaSilva (@camdasilva) November 5, 2018\n\nGrade: C+\n\nOutside linebacker\n\nDante Fowler Jr. made his Rams debut and while he wasn\u2019t consistently generating pressure, he did have a tackle for loss and a batted pass at the line. Samson Ebukam forced a fumble and had two tackles, but his pass rushing wasn\u2019t exactly effective. They were the two primary players at outside linebacker with Matt Longacre chipping in two tackles.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nCornerback\n\nThis goes without question. The cornerbacks failed on Sunday and were the primary reason for the Rams\u2019 loss. Marcus Peters owned up to it and said he has to play better after allowing a big day to Michael Thomas.

(AP Photo/David Richard) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe Vikings, Broncos, Texans and Ravens being off in Week 10 means there are plenty of bye week players to replace in lineups.\n\nYou'll be without the likes of Adam Thielen, Kirk Cousins, Phillip Lindsay, Emmanuel Sanders, DeAndre Hopkins and Deshaun Watson this week. Work the waiver wire aggressively and with a forward-looking focus.\n\nRUNNING BACKS\n\nDUKE JOHNSON JR., Browns (49.6 percent owned): He was cut in some very competitive leagues recently, but a coaching overhaul in Cleveland has led to Johnson quickly regaining fantasy relevance. Johnson caught nine passes for 78 yards on Sunday, and with the Browns lacking a quality second wideout he should remain in the flow going forward. Make him a top waiver priority or be willing to spend handsomely if your league uses a free agent acquisition budget. If you need RB help in a point-per-reception format, don't hesitate to spend 50 to 60 percent of your budget.\n\nMIKE DAVIS, Seahawks (18.5): He totaled 107 yards from scrimmage and caught seven passes on Sunday as Chris Carson could not make it out of the early stages of the game. Carson is already looking iffy this week with hip and groin problems and he has been a consistent injury concern. Davis is clearly preferred by the Seattle coaching staff over Rashaad Penny and faces the league's worst run defense (the Rams) in Week 10.\n\nJOSH ADAMS (3.0): We advised picking him up last week but he was only added in 2.5 percent of leagues. Many owners passed on him because Adams was on a bye week. Don't overlook players who have byes, when you can get the jump on passive league mates. Adams may start for the Eagles coming off the bye.\n\nWIDE RECEIVERS\n\nMARQUES VALDES-SCANTLING (20.8): Not enough owners paid attention to injury news late last week, which indicated Geronimo Allison would likely be out with a groin injury, boosting Valdes-Scantling's outlook again. Now Allison may be done for the season and Randall Cobb is oft-injured and only had 24 receiving yards last week. The rookie has either reached 100 yards or scored in his last four games and has quickly risen to fantasy WR3 status.\n\nADAM HUMPHRIES, Buccaneers (2.8): In the past, he had flashed some potential to be a decent fantasy player, then totally defied expectations in Week 9 with eight catches for 82 yards and two TD receptions. He used to be more of a Jameis Winston favorite, but Ryan Fitzpatrick can use him as a reliable option from the slot.\n\nJOHN ROSS, Bengals (8.1): Ross has started to practice as he anticipates a potential return from a groin injury, and with A.J. Green possibly missing two games or more with a toe problem, Ross becomes a viable waiver target because of increased opportunity. Tyler Boyd may get extra defensive attention during Green's absence, and Ross will likely be more targeted more frequently. His big-play promise is no secret to seasoned fantasy players.\n\nTIGHT ENDS\n\nC.J. UZOMAH, Bengals (18.2): He has disappointed since becoming the clear No. 1 at his position in Cincinnati because of injuries, but Uzomah also still has some lingering appeal because of the Green injury. Andy Dalton will always consider his tight ends when inside the 10-yard line, and Uzomah has some TD potential while Green is out.\n\nJEFF HEUERMAN, Broncos (7.9): Here's a guy on a bye that you need to add now if TE is a desperation need. Heuerman immediately stepped into the Demaryius Thomas void left by the WR's departure, catching 10 passes for 83 yards and a TD in a career performance. While his statistical ceiling may not be as high as those numbers indicate going forward, you have to take a waiver chance on the improved production possibly lasting more than one game.\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nLAMAR JACKSON, Ravens (1.5): This is a forward-looking waiver move where you possibly can get ahead of the rest of the league, as Baltimore is on a bye. Joe Flacco has four TD passes in his past five games and 398 passing yards with one TD and two interceptions in his last two outings. There could be a QB change coming in Baltimore soon. Jackson looked like an erratic passer in the preseason, but his rushing and playmaking skills point to some tantalizing fantasy possibilities if he gets inserted into the Ravens guiding role.\n\n___\n\nFor more waiver and Week 10 advice, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

So it's \"not unexpected\" that they would make these accusations given Lampert's history of lending to Sears.\n\nWhat's \"pretty unusual,\" he said, is that Lampert is acting simultaneously as debtor, investor, lender, landlord and vendor.\n\nSears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October, hoping to shed debts and close more than 180 unprofitable stores in a bid to stay open as a smaller company.

(Photo: MARK RALSTON/ AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe dragging-on divorce and custody battle between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is set to go to a trial next month because they can't agree about the future of their six children despite two years of lawyering and leaking.\n\nAnd if Pitt and Jolie have their way, it will all happen behind closed doors. If it happens at all.\n\nThe couple could still reach an agreement out of court and put the messy breakup of their family behind them but lately their ability to see eye-to-eye seems to have deserted them.\n\nStill, a source familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly said both sides \"are still working together to find an out-of-court settlement.\u201d\n\n\"Sometimes spouses do not realize that just because someone may be a bad spouse that does not automatically mean that person is a bad parent,\" says New York City-based divorce lawyer Jacqueline Newman, who's been watching the case as an example of how a breakup can go terribly wrong.\n\nThe two stars' legal teams have been in fierce negotiations since September 2016, when Jolie filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences and \"the health of the family\" after 12 years together, two of those years in what we later learned wasn't wedded bliss.\n\nTheir custody dispute comes down to this: She wants sole physical custody of their six kids, ranging in age from 10 to 17; he wants to share physical custody.\n\nNow, according toa document filed Monday in Los Angeles County's Family Court, Pitt and Jolie have asked for an extension to June 30, 2019, on the appointment of retired Judge John Ouderkirk as a temporary \"private\" judge in their case.\n\nHe has handled all pre-trial issues and motions and will preside over the custody trial, scheduled for Dec. 4, likely behind closed doors and not at a public courthouse. In fact, because the case is being handled privately , Jolie and Pitt have to pay for the proceeding, including the judge and other officials.\n\nIn California's public Family Courts, most proceedings are open to the public except certain issues involving children, when the courtroom can be closed.\n\nFebruary 17, 2017 Angelina Jolie with some of her children including Maddox Jolie-Pitt (C) at a meeting with Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni in Siem Reap, in February 2017. (Photo: TANG CHHIN SOTHY/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAssuming the Jolie-Pitt custody case goes to a trial, the media might be barred from the proceeding if either party requests it and the judge agrees.\n\nBut John Chason, a family-law specialist with 23 years experience in California, says that could depend on where the trial is held and on whether the media challenge a closed-door proceeding. Most private proceedings are held in law offices or mediation centers, not public courthouses, he said.\n\n\"They are not automatically closed but as a practical matter how does (the media or the public) attend a proceeding before a private judge in a private law office or conference center?\" Chason said.\n\nHe suggested that media coverage of such a trial could be handled by a pool of reporters representing all the media. \"In California court proceedings are public so if the media wanted to be in there, I would think they have to be allowed,\" Chason said.\n\nAside from privacy, there are good reasons to hire a private judge (usually for about $600-$700 an hour), says Chason: They can arrange hearings and discussions around the divorcing parties' schedules (crucial for movie stars constantly on the move), they can offer a low-profile law office to meet in instead of a public courthouse crammed with reporters and onlookers, and they generally take on one case at a time.\n\n\"You are the only case that day \u2013 you are the only case on their dance card,\" Chason says.\n\nEven though the Jolie-Pitt divorce has been a \"private\" matter since at least January 2017, it has not stopped the regular leaking about developments in the case.\n\nRepresentatives for both stars declined to comment to USA TODAY.\n\nThe breakdown arc of the Pitt-Jolie marriage began a month after Jolie shocked Hollywood by filing for divorce in September 2016, just two years after the romantic wedding in the French countryside they said their kids wanted.\n\nThe following month anonymous accusations surfaced that she acted because Pitt was drinking heavily and after he got into a fight with oldest son, Maddox, on a plane.\n\nThose allegations were short-lived \u2013 he was investigated by the county Department of Children and Family Services and the FBI and was cleared \u2013 but they were damaging to Pitt's reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, their lawyers were dickering behind closed doors. As in any celeb divorce, the usual unnamed \"sources\" were leaking to benefit one side or the other.\n\nIn November 2017, Jolie claimed she and Pitt had reached an interim custody agreement in which she would continue to have sole physical custody of the kids. But Pitt immediately disputed that, claiming it was only an extension of an existing interim agreement.\n\nBy January 2017 the couple had hired their private judge and the tabloid headlines quieted down for a while.\n\nIn June 2018, the judge issued an order to Jolie warning her that if she didn't start encouraging the children to forge relationships with their father, she could be in danger of losing custody. The judge said it was critical that each child have a healthy and strong relationship with both parents.\n\nThen in August 2018, a Jolie bombshell: She accused Pitt of not paying any \"meaningful\" child support for a year and a half and sought to force him to pay up what he allegedly owed.\n\nPitt hit back, asserting in court documents that he loaned Jolie $8 million for her current Los Angeles residence and has paid over $1.3 million in bills for her and the children.\n\nAll of this makes matrimonial lawyers such as Newman despair. She says she tells clients to think about how they want their children to describe their parents' divorce when they get older.\n\n\"Do they want their children to say 'My mom and dad kept it between themselves and just let us know how much they loved us and always supported our relationship with the other parent,\u201d or 'My mother hated my father and let us all know it. It was like living through a war.'\n\n\"It is even worse for (the Jolie-Pitt kids) because their parents\u2019 war is being played out in the media for them to see and all of their friends to see,\" Newman said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/06/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-custody-battle-six-kids-private-trial/1901894002/", "", "", "bad url", "Few people appreciate a live college football mascot more than Washington State coach Mike Leach.

That\u2019s hard to argue with unless you have a live grizzly bear out there or something.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Washington State should get a live mascot, Leach was down with the thought while unsure how a live cougar would respond in captivity.\n\n\u201cWe should. It would be cool if we still did. I don\u2019t know how good mountain lions do in captivity. I\u2019m curious. If they have just a good, happy life like the Georgia bulldog where they get their own hotel room and eat like a king.

Yeah, Nick Mullens. The 49ers\u2019 third-string quarterback really showed in Week 9 against the Raiders that: No. 1, Oakland stinks, and No. 2, Kyle Shanahan is pretty good as an offensive coach. Three touchdowns from any third-stringer is great. Mullens plays another bottom feeder in the New York Giants next week so he\u2019s worth a shot if you need a QB.\n\nQB Josh Rosen, Arizona Cardinals\n\nIn Week 8, former NFLer and newly appointed play caller for Rosen and the Cards, Bryon Leftwich, took over those duties. Rosen had his best outing of the season with 252 passing yards and two scores. He\u2019s playing the Chiefs this week and while KC is the heavy favorite, that just means Rosen will pass that much more.\n\nRB/ WR Cordarrelle Patterson, New England Patriots\n\nThe dual-threat back might not be that attractive of an add if Sony Michel returns to the lineup, but if Michel doesn\u2019t Patterson has been an interesting player the past few weeks. Last week he had 61 rushing yards on 11 carries and had a catch with a touchdown sprinkled in there.\n\nRB Ito Smith, Atlanta Falcons\n\nSmith is splitting time with Tevin Coleman, but he\u2019s the one getting to the end zone. In four of his last five games, Smith has scored. Worth a gamble with the Cleveland Browns on the horizon.\n\nWR Anthony Miller, Chicago Bears\n\nMitchell Trubisky only connected on 12 of 20 pass attempts last week, but five went to Miller as he\u2019s starting to get more looks. Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel are dealing with injuries as of late as well.", "", "Boise State quarterback Brett Rypien (4) looks to throw down field as BYU linebacker Sione Takitaki (16) puts pressure on in the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Boise, Idaho.

The full three-team AP All-America selections will be unveiled in December. The eighth All-America watch of the season features Arizona State's top target; Alabama's dominant defensive tackle and Boise State's quarterback, all on the verge of breaking records.\n\nSPOTLIGHT\n\nN'Keal Harry, WR, Arizona State\n\nHarry came into the season as one of the most highly touted receivers in the country. He has not put eye-catching numbers as Arizona State has tried to lean heavily on its running game, but he has been steady and productive. No Pac-12 receiver has been a more effective target, according to Pro Football Focus . Harry broke out with his best game of the season last week in a huge victory for the Sun Devils against Utah. The 6-foot-, 221-pound junior had nine catches for 161 yards and three touchdowns. For the season, he has 55 catches for 828 yards and nine TDs.\n\nWhat they are saying: \"We didn't throw it a lot, but we made it count. N'Keal's a fabulous player and he has two back-to-back games now where without his presence, it hurts you,\" Arizona State coach Herm Edwards said.\n\nOutlook: The Sun Devils are in the driver's seat in a cluttered Pac-12 South race. Some more big efforts from Harry could help get them to the conference title game.\n\nWHO'S HOT\n\nQuinnen Williams, DT, Alabama\n\nWilliams has been hot all season , but he came up huge in Alabama's biggest game of the season so far against LSU. He had 10 tackles, seven solo stops and 2\u00bd sacks against the Tigers. The third-year sophomore entered the season without much fanfare after being a reserve for the Crimson Tide last year. The 6-foot-4, 298-pounder is talked about as the possible first overall pick in next year's NFL draft, surging past a slew of talented defensive line who will be available in April.\n\nWHO'S NOT\n\nEd Oliver, DT, Houston\n\nOliver figures to be high first-round draft pick by the NFL in April, and the school was promoting him as a Heisman Trophy contender coming into this season. He was mostly living up to his hype, making the midseason All-America team, but he was injured against Navy three weeks ago and has not played the Cougars' last two games. Last week he was expected to come back, but was a late scratch against SMU. The competition at defensive tackle is stiff. If Oliver misses more time, he could get shut out from postseason honors.\n\nGROUP OF FIVE STAR\n\nBrett Rypien, QB, Boise State\n\nThe senior has thrown for 2,779 yards with 24 touchdowns and six interceptions for a Broncos team that began the season with hopes of a getting into a New Year's Six bowl and the playoff discussion. That's likely gone after two losses, but the Mountain West crown is still very much in play. Rypien leads Boise State against No. 16 Fresno State this week. Last season, he threw for 246 yards against the Bulldogs tough defense, but completed only 53 percent and didn't throw a touchdown pass. He is poised to become the Mountain West career leader in yards passing and completions.\n\nON THE LINE\n\nESPN analyst Cole Cubelic, a former guard at Auburn, identifies an offensive lineman playing at an All-America level \u2014 Calvin Throckmorton, OT, Oregon.\n\nThe junior has not allowed a sack in his last 27 games.\n\n\"Versatile. Combines power and quickness while playing three different positions on the offensive line this season, including both tackle spots and center,\" Cubelic said.\n\nALL-AMERICA MATCHUP\n\nChris Lindstrom, OG, Boston College vs. Clemson DTs Dexter Lawrence and Christian Wilkins.\n\nBoston College's offensive line has been one of the best in the Atlantic Coast Conference this season and Lindstrom is its leader. The 310-pound senior is a three-year starter and expected to be one of the first guards taken in the NFL draft. Lawrence and Wilkins are both possible first-rounders, with different styles. Lawrence is massive and powerful at 340 pounds. Wilkins is a 300-pounder with rare athleticism. In a game that could decide the ACC Atlantic division, the interior line matchup will be pivotal.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Mullens\u2019 151.9 pass rating was the highest for any quarterback in his 49ers debut. His 262 yards were also a record.\n\nFor one week only, Mullens looked like one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and he can thank Kyle Shanahan\u2019s brilliant offensive mind for his moment in the spotlight.\n\nPlaying quarterback in the NFL is never easy. But it can be made easier using a variety of tactics. Shanahan, forced to start an undrafted free agent who had never taken a regular season snap, used those tactics repeatedly and to great effect on Thursday night.\n\nThe second-year coach schemed up pre-snap tells that revealed the defensive coverage to his young quarterback. He created wide-open passing lanes with brilliant play-action designs. And he got the ball out of Mullens\u2019 hands as quickly as possible, protecting him from pressure.\n\nMullens attempted 22 passes on the night. Only one of those attempts did not feature either a pre-snap motion or play-action fake. One! And that one attempt? It was an incomplete pass.\n\nLets take a more in-depth look at the two methods Shanahan employed to turn an unheralded prospect into a record-breaking quarterback in just a matter of days\u2026\n\nPre-snap motion to reveal coverage\n\nThis might the most underused tactic in the sport of football. The best coaches in the league know how to interrogate the defense with motion, forcing an opponent to reveal its intentions. There are two strategies for getting the defense to show its hand before the ball is snapped, and Shanahan used both on Thursday night.\n\nThe first is to motion a back or tight end out to the perimeter. If a linebacker or safety follows him out there, he can expect some sort of man coverage, because the defense wants to keep its corners on receivers in man-to-man matchups and not waste them on non-receivers. If the corner widens out with the back, though, the QB is probably looking at zone coverage.\n\nOn this play, the linebacker follows the back out, so Mullens knows he\u2019s got man coverage and all he has to do is toss the ball out to H-back Kyle Juszczyk, who\u2019s receiving a natural pick from the tight end.\n\nAll the mental work was done for Mullens before the ball was snapped. When a quaterback doesn\u2019t have to think, the position is so much easier to play.\n\nThe second method is to motion a receiver across the formation. If the defender lined up across from him follows along, it\u2019s a pretty good sign that the defense is in man coverage. If not, it\u2019s probably zone coverage.\n\nOn this touchdown pass, the defense just sort of shifts over in reaction to Kenrick Bourne\u2019s motion across the formation, telling Mullens it\u2019s some sort of zone coverage.\n\nThe Raiders are actually in a hybrid coverage, with the defensive backs to the right manning up, but the play side linebacker is dropping back into a zone, making him a factor in the play. Mullens knows he has to freeze him with his eyes in order to keep the throwing window open. That\u2019s what he does. The linebacker follows his eyes, vacates his zone and leaves Bourne open in the end zone for an easy touchdown throw.\n\nNow here\u2019s a play where the Raiders corner does follow the motioning receiver across the formation, indicating man coverage. With Oakland showing blitz, Mullens knows the middle of the field will be open for this slant route that picks up a huge chunk of yards.\n\nThere were instances where Shanahan used both methods to help clear things up for his young quarterback. In fact, he did so on the very first snap of the game. RB Matt Breida is lined up out wide with a corner across from him (zone tell!) and George Kittle\u2019s motion across the formation does not draw a defender along with him (another zone tell!).\n\nSo Mullens knows if Breida\u2019s vertical route takes the outside corner downfield, he has plenty of room to make the throw to Marquise Goodwin on the quick out route. That\u2019s exactly what happens, and Mullens makes the easy throw to get his night off on the right foot.\n\nThe 49ers used pre-snap motion before 18 of Mullens\u2019 22 dropbacks. Even for San Francisco, which uses motion on an NFL-leading 67.5% of its snaps, that\u2019s a high number.\n\nPlay-action to create space\n\nPlay-action is a quarterback\u2019s best friend. But simply faking a handoff to a running back does not guarantee passing success. The best offensive coaches use specific fakes in combination with certain routes to create swaths of space for their quarterbacks and receivers to take advantage of. On Thursday night, Shanahan did this by putting both vertical and horizontal stress on the Raiders defense with his play-action designs.\n\nHere the 49ers fake a run up the middle and have the slot receiver run a clear out route down the field. The second-level of the defense, reacting to the run fake, steps up; the secondary, reacting to the clear-out, steps back; that pries open the middle of the defense.\n\nOn this throw Mullens ends up missing, the 49ers a fake to the outside right and send the slot receiver on an out route to the left, creating a window for Goodwin on the crossing route.\n\nMullens faked a handoff on 45.5% of his attempts on Thursday night. Only Cam Newton had a higher ration in Week 9. On those play-action attempts, the 49ers quarterback completed 70% of his passes for an average of 10.1 yards-per-attempt and two touchdowns. Not bad.\n\nThanks to Shanahan\u2019s pre- and post-snap designs, Mullens rarely had to come off his first read. As soon as he hit the back of his drop, Mullens could let the ball go. His average time to throw was 2.46 seconds \u2014 only three quarterbacks got rid of the ball faster in Week 9, per Next Gen Stats. The result: He was pressured only three times and the Raiders did not record a single sack. This was essentially a 60-minute 7-on-7 drill for him.\n\nI counted only three attempts where Mullens\u2019 first look wasn\u2019t the receiver he eventually threw to. One was the play-action miss we broke down above. Another was that crazy one-handed catch by George Kittle. And the other was a dropped interception in the end zone.\n\nMullens deserves credit for making accurate throws \u2014 C.J. Beathard has struggled to make them playing in the same offense \u2014 but the bulk of the credit for his historic debut belongs to Shanahan, who continues to get good performances out of underwhelming talents behind center.\n\nIt makes you wonder: Did the 49ers really have to spend $137.5 million on a quarterback with this coach pulling the strings? Jimmy Garoppolo is an intriguing talent who is obviously easier to build an offense for than an undrafted free agent, but the NFL has become a cap-driven league.

Not in 2018. Not with Garoppolo out for the season with a torn ACL. This appears to be Nick Mullens\u2019 team now, which is a sentence no 49ers fan was expecting to read back in September. But with Shanahan on the sideline, it is a lot easier to accept.", "In an NFL week replete with exceptional quarterbacking performances, Nick Mullens\u2019 262-yard-yard, three-touchdown gem in the 49ers\u2019 34-3 win over the Raiders stood out.\n\nStatistically speaking, it was the most impressive quarterback debut for a franchise that has sent two passers to Canton and several more to Pro Bowls. Mullens\u2019 151.9 pass rating was the highest for any quarterback in his 49ers debut. His 262 yards were also a record.\n\nFor one week only, Mullens looked like one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and he can thank Kyle Shanahan\u2019s brilliant offensive mind for his moment in the spotlight.\n\nPlaying quarterback in the NFL is never easy. But it can be made easier using a variety of tactics. Shanahan, forced to start an undrafted free agent who had never taken a regular season snap, used those tactics repeatedly and to great effect on Thursday night.\n\nThe second-year coach schemed up pre-snap tells that revealed the defensive coverage to his young quarterback. He created wide-open passing lanes with brilliant play-action designs. And he got the ball out of Mullens\u2019 hands as quickly as possible, protecting him from pressure.\n\nMullens attempted 22 passes on the night. Only one of those attempts did not feature either a pre-snap motion or play-action fake. One! And that one attempt? It was an incomplete pass.\n\nLets take a more in-depth look at the two methods Shanahan employed to turn an unheralded prospect into a record-breaking quarterback in just a matter of days\u2026\n\nPre-snap motion to reveal coverage\n\nThis might the most underused tactic in the sport of football. The best coaches in the league know how to interrogate the defense with motion, forcing an opponent to reveal its intentions. There are two strategies for getting the defense to show its hand before the ball is snapped, and Shanahan used both on Thursday night.\n\nThe first is to motion a back or tight end out to the perimeter. If a linebacker or safety follows him out there, he can expect some sort of man coverage, because the defense wants to keep its corners on receivers in man-to-man matchups and not waste them on non-receivers. If the corner widens out with the back, though, the QB is probably looking at zone coverage.\n\nOn this play, the linebacker follows the back out, so Mullens knows he\u2019s got man coverage and all he has to do is toss the ball out to H-back Kyle Juszczyk, who\u2019s receiving a natural pick from the tight end.\n\nAll the mental work was done for Mullens before the ball was snapped. When a quaterback doesn\u2019t have to think, the position is so much easier to play.\n\nThe second method is to motion a receiver across the formation. If the defender lined up across from him follows along, it\u2019s a pretty good sign that the defense is in man coverage. If not, it\u2019s probably zone coverage.\n\nOn this touchdown pass, the defense just sort of shifts over in reaction to Kenrick Bourne\u2019s motion across the formation, telling Mullens it\u2019s some sort of zone coverage.\n\nThe Raiders are actually in a hybrid coverage, with the defensive backs to the right manning up, but the play side linebacker is dropping back into a zone, making him a factor in the play. Mullens knows he has to freeze him with his eyes in order to keep the throwing window open. That\u2019s what he does. The linebacker follows his eyes, vacates his zone and leaves Bourne open in the end zone for an easy touchdown throw.\n\nNow here\u2019s a play where the Raiders corner does follow the motioning receiver across the formation, indicating man coverage. With Oakland showing blitz, Mullens knows the middle of the field will be open for this slant route that picks up a huge chunk of yards.\n\nThere were instances where Shanahan used both methods to help clear things up for his young quarterback. In fact, he did so on the very first snap of the game. RB Matt Breida is lined up out wide with a corner across from him (zone tell!) and George Kittle\u2019s motion across the formation does not draw a defender along with him (another zone tell!).\n\nSo Mullens knows if Breida\u2019s vertical route takes the outside corner downfield, he has plenty of room to make the throw to Marquise Goodwin on the quick out route. That\u2019s exactly what happens, and Mullens makes the easy throw to get his night off on the right foot.\n\nThe 49ers used pre-snap motion before 18 of Mullens\u2019 22 dropbacks. Even for San Francisco, which uses motion on an NFL-leading 67.5% of its snaps, that\u2019s a high number.\n\nPlay-action to create space\n\nPlay-action is a quarterback\u2019s best friend. But simply faking a handoff to a running back does not guarantee passing success. The best offensive coaches use specific fakes in combination with certain routes to create swaths of space for their quarterbacks and receivers to take advantage of. On Thursday night, Shanahan did this by putting both vertical and horizontal stress on the Raiders defense with his play-action designs.\n\nHere the 49ers fake a run up the middle and have the slot receiver run a clear out route down the field. The second-level of the defense, reacting to the run fake, steps up; the secondary, reacting to the clear-out, steps back; that pries open the middle of the defense.\n\nOn this throw Mullens ends up missing, the 49ers a fake to the outside right and send the slot receiver on an out route to the left, creating a window for Goodwin on the crossing route.\n\nMullens faked a handoff on 45.5% of his attempts on Thursday night. Only Cam Newton had a higher ration in Week 9. On those play-action attempts, the 49ers quarterback completed 70% of his passes for an average of 10.1 yards-per-attempt and two touchdowns. Not bad.\n\nThanks to Shanahan\u2019s pre- and post-snap designs, Mullens rarely had to come off his first read. As soon as he hit the back of his drop, Mullens could let the ball go. His average time to throw was 2.46 seconds \u2014 only three quarterbacks got rid of the ball faster in Week 9, per Next Gen Stats. The result: He was pressured only three times and the Raiders did not record a single sack. This was essentially a 60-minute 7-on-7 drill for him.\n\nI counted only three attempts where Mullens\u2019 first look wasn\u2019t the receiver he eventually threw to. One was the play-action miss we broke down above. Another was that crazy one-handed catch by George Kittle. And the other was a dropped interception in the end zone.\n\nMullens deserves credit for making accurate throws \u2014 C.J. Beathard has struggled to make them playing in the same offense \u2014 but the bulk of the credit for his historic debut belongs to Shanahan, who continues to get good performances out of underwhelming talents behind center.\n\nIt makes you wonder: Did the 49ers really have to spend $137.5 million on a quarterback with this coach pulling the strings? Jimmy Garoppolo is an intriguing talent who is obviously easier to build an offense for than an undrafted free agent, but the NFL has become a cap-driven league. The biggest commodity is a cheap quarterback who can perform at a high level. That allows a team to build up the rest of the roster. We saw the Eagles do this last season; we\u2019re seeing the Rams do it this season.\n\nThe 49ers skipped a step. They got their young quarterback, whose performance in San Francisco has undoubtedly been buoyed by Shanahan\u2019s play-calling, and immediately gave him a record-breaking sum of money, thus mitigating the advantage provided by having a coach like Shanahan.\n\nQuarterbacks make the most money because they have the hardest job on the field. Shanahan makes that job somewhat easier, so the 49ers, more so than teams without an offensive genius on the sideline, can afford to skimp on the position while spending financial resources on positions he may not have as much of an effect on.\n\nThat\u2019s more of a concern for the franchise going forward, though.

Fifteen years after becoming the first woman to qualify for a PGA event in 58 years, Whaley is expected to be elected on Friday as the first female president of the PGA of America. (AP Photo/Steve Miller, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTwo moments of discrimination took place 1,000 miles and worlds apart, neither pointing to Suzy Whaley making history this week at the PGA of America.\n\nWhaley was just getting hooked on golf in Syracuse, New York, and she was good enough to compete in tournaments when her name was scratched off the entry list of a junior tournament for boys because she was a girl.\n\n\"And now I've played in a PGA Tour event,\" said Whaley, who at the 2003 Greater Hartford Open became the first woman in 58 years to qualify for a PGA Tour event. \"Look how far we've gone. It's not where we need to be, but we're making progress. And that makes me smile.\"\n\nAround the time Whaley had her first whiff of discrimination as a young girl, Barrie Naismith Jeffcoat was working at a golf club in Atlanta as a 29-year-old woman who was giving lessons and going nowhere.\n\nShe hired young men to handle the carts and pick up golf balls from the range. Some of them went on to become PGA professionals and got jobs at other clubs.\n\nShe couldn't join the PGA as a certified pro because she was a woman.\n\n\"Something was wrong with this picture,\" Naismith Jeffcoat said in a telephone interview Monday from her home in Virginia. \"At the time I was giving lessons to Superior Court Judge (Joel) Fryer. He gave me the name of his attorney. The attorney advised me to call the PGA. I got a lawyer on the phone with the PGA and he told me, 'You can call Jimmy Carter, but it won't do you any good.'\"\n\nInstead of calling the president, she filed a lawsuit against the PGA in 1978. By the end of the year, the PGA signed the Naismith Consent Degree, giving women equal rights to become PGA professionals. Naismith became the first female member on Feb. 1, 1979.\n\nShe stayed with the PGA a few more years, yet the impact will be felt strongest this week at the PGA of America's annual meeting in California.\n\nWhaley is set to become the first female president in its 102-year history.\n\n\"I'm so thrilled she'll have a high profile,\" said Naismith Jeffcoat, who has never met Whaley. \"There will be a lot of young women that will take up the game and want to be involved. It's very exciting to me to see it come to fruition.\"\n\nWhaley is a consensus-builder, perhaps her greatest asset.\n\nShe is foremost a golf professional, still giving private lessons at Suzy Whaley Golf, the course she owns in Cromwell, Connecticut, and serving as PGA director of instruction at the Country Club of Mirasol in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, during the winter months. Her husband, Bill, was her first golf coach. Both her daughters played in college.\n\n\"My strength would be that I love the game of golf. I want to get clubs in people's hands,\" said Whaley, recently certified as a master professional. \"My vision for the membership is to help enhance their careers. How can we get them resources and tools to go where they want to go?\"\n\nShe also recognizes the historic occasion of the annual meeting Friday, and she doesn't take it lightly.\n\n\"It's definitely historic, and I'm honored and completely grateful the membership has that faith and trust,\" she said. \"I look at myself as a PGA professional first. Obviously, I'm a woman. I understand the moniker. There are women who have paved the way before me.\"\n\nOne was Renee Powell, who last year was inducted into the PGA of America Hall of Fame. Another was Sue Fiscoe, who ran unsuccessfully for national office at the PGA in 2012, which motivated Whaley to run herself two years later.\n\nWhaley rose to national prominence when she won the Connecticut PGA section in 2002, earning a spot in the Greater Hartford Open. That's what inspired Annika Sorenstam to say she would accept an invitation to a PGA Tour event, which she received within weeks at the Colonial. Sorenstam played two months before Whaley.\n\nHer name recognition might have received a boost when weeks before Whaley's election as secretary in 2014, Ted Bishop was ousted as PGA president for calling Ian Poulter a \"Lil girl\" during a social media rant.\n\nBut while Naismith Jeffcoat caused consternation in some circles \u2014 after she joined the PGA of America, two men threatened to sue to join the LPGA \u2014 Whaley received 53 percent of the votes from PGA delegates, only three of whom were women, and won election by 19 percentage points.\n\nAfter two years as secretary and two years as vice president, it's time for the 51-year-old Whaley to lead the 29,000 men and women at the PGA of America. She didn't want to be president because she's a woman.\n\nShe still understands the moment in front of her.\n\n\"I wanted to have a seat at the table, a voice in the room,\" she said. \"I didn't look at it as male or female. I felt I had something to contribute. That doesn't mean it's not difficult. It's an enormous opportunity for equality, and to showcase to women what they can do. Golf is an $84 billion industry we want to contribute to.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He wants the Cowboys to start over \u2014 from top to bottom.\n\nAikman joined The Musers on 1310 The Ticket Tuesday and called for the Cowboys to make changes while somewhat standing up for head coach Jason Garrett at the same time. He said that there was a lot of \u201cdysfunction\u201d throughout the organization.\n\nTroy Aikman tells The Musers the Cowboys have a myriad of problems: \"Changing the coach is one thing, but you have to look at how things are run out there (The Star). I talk to people in the building and from what I hear is that there's a lot of dysfunction.\" \u2014 1310 The Ticket (@dfwticket) November 6, 2018\n\nVia dallasnews.com:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think, where he\u2019s (Jerry Jones) at right now, that he wants to go through another regime change. I think he\u2019s very comfortable with Jason (Garrett). I do believe he respects Jason and he\u2019s hoping like crazy that good things will happen here down the stretch so that a change doesn\u2019t have to take place.\u201d However\u2026 \u201cBut I think the one thing Jerry has done over the years, whether it\u2019s accurate or not, I think Jerry has done things after seasons to at least give a fan base hope going into the following year. And that will happen again this year, whether that ultimately means the head coach, a change there, or something else.\u201d\n\nAikman continued:\n\n\u201cGo through the list and this team, over a long period of time, has been what it\u2019s been,\u201d Aikman said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t always mattered who the head coach has been. So to me, if you\u2019re asking me, I\u2019d say there has to be a complete overhaul of the entire organization. You can\u2019t just can\u2019t simply replace head coaches and say, \u2018Now it\u2019s going to be better.\u2019 No, it\u2019s been shown that it\u2019s not better. And you have to address how everything is being done. \u201cAnd there\u2019s been times where I\u2019ve heard Jerry say, \u2018OK, look, we\u2019re going to do it differently. I\u2019m going to do it differently.\u2019 But it\u2019s the same. Nothing changes. And that to me is the bigger issue, beyond, \u2018Yes, coaching\u2019s important, personnel, all those things are important, but how are you going about evaluating? How are you going about running the organization?\u201d\n\nYou can read more about the interview here.", "", "", "", "CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' NFL power rankings following Week 9 of the season, with the Saints moving to No. 1 and looking like true Super Bowl contenders.

Saints (2): Handing Rams their first defeat earns catbird seat. But despite owning key tiebreaker, New Orleans has much tougher path to NFC's top seed.\n\n2. Rams (1): After getting roasted by Drew Brees, CB Marcus Peters was summarily roasted on social media. Aqib Talib's return will be important waypoint.\n\n3. Patriots (3): Bill Belichick has to be wondering if former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Matt Patricia will provide any potential cheat codes to fellow rookie HC Mike Vrabel this week.\n\n4. Chiefs (4): Patrick Mahomes continues grabbing headlines, but defense quietly jelling into decent unit even as it adapts sans Justin Houston, Eric Berry.\n\n5. Chargers (5): Next three opponents 6-19 collectively. Bolts will be in mix for AFC's best record \u2014 not that \"home\" playoff games would help them much.\n\nFAN RANKINGS: We want your ranking from 1 to 32\n\n6. Steelers (6): Wouldn't they be better off if Le'Veon Bell simply opts not to show up at all \u2014 as odd a financial stratagem as that would ultimately be?\n\n7. Panthers (8): After wasted rookie year, 2017 second rounder Curtis Samuel steadily becoming next weapon in this attack with three TDs last three weeks.\n\n8. Vikings (9): Balanced offense, return of a smothering defense \u2014 this probably pretty close to type of team Mike Zimmer envisioned all along.\n\n9. Eagles (10): Do bye weeks get better? Injury bug bit down hard on NFC East-leading Washington. Meanwhile, Philly picked up Golden Tate. Champs are back.\n\n10. Bengals (12): When you've got \u00bd-game lead for final wild card, New Orleans isn't team you want coming out your bye \u2014 especially with A.J. Green hurt.\n\n11.

Bears (15): They just got flexed into \"Sunday Night Football\" for Week 11. Let's hope Khalil Mack's ankle healthy enough to allow him to play by then.\n\n13. Texans (17): It's not fair to diminish a six-game winning streak against NFL competition, but Miami (5-4) is only victim with winning record on list.\n\n14. Redskins (7): And we were worried Adrian Peterson might break down. Instead, pretty much all of Washington's O-line is suddenly in street clothes.\n\n15. Packers (11): Close-but-no-cigar outcomes have worn thin, especially since we'll now wonder how defense would have looked if Ha Ha Clinton-Dix remained.\n\n16. Ravens (13): As season stunningly spirals away, might be time to give Lamar Jackson shot rather than continue untenable Joe Flacco-Jackson packages.\n\n17. Seahawks (16): Nice to see first-class LB K.J. Wright back in action. Seattle will need him entering defining stretch against Rams, Pack and Panthers.\n\n18. Dolphins (20): R\u00e9sum\u00e9 suggests Frank Gore, never an all-pro, isn't Hall of Famer. Stats say otherwise. He just passed Barry Sanders with sixth-most scrimmage yards.\n\n19. Titans (21): Wisely starting to allow this offense to flow through RB Dion Lewis, who carved Dallas up for 122 yards in Monday night's upset.\n\nMore: 'Lesser men would back away': How will Cowboys respond to mockery by Titans?\n\nMore: Jerry Jones says there are no plans to fire Jason Garrett after Dallas Cowboys' fifth loss\n\nMore: Titans' season saved by Kevin Byard, reversed by Marcus Mariota\n\n20. Cowboys (18): Just one game, but addition of WR Amari Cooper did little to mask this offense's bigger issues \u2014 Dak's limitations and line's struggles.\n\n21. Jaguars (22): Leonard Fournette was back on practice field Monday, but is his potential return too little, too late? Maybe not after glance at schedule.\n\n22. Lions (19): Matthew Stafford gets sacked 10 times ... offense has season-low 209 yards (just 66 rushing) ... we're looking at you, O-line.\n\n23. Buccaneers (23): What's left to say? Final score was respectable Sunday, but this was offense's least productive day of 2018 despite Fitzmagic\u2019s return.\n\n24. Browns (24): Bruce Arians wants this job. We want Bruce Arians back on NFL sideline. We want Bruce Arians teamed with Baker Mayfield. This should happen.\n\n25. Jets (25): Shake it off, Sam. Joe Namath threw at least 27 interceptions in three different seasons ... not to suggest you have that kind of leeway.\n\n26. Broncos (27): Jeff Heuerman about to become pick-up du jour in fantasy leagues starved for decent tight end options. We may be overselling this.\n\n27. Colts (26): Unless they vacationed during bye week, players won't have to leave state of Indiana during month of November. Now's time to make a move.\n\n28. Cardinals (29): They can use some inspiration. Maybe signing Aurora, Colo., shooting survivor Zack Golditch will provide it ... while bolstering O-line.\n\n29. 49ers (31): Poor Jimmy Garoppolo. He's got a full year to wonder if he just got Majkowski'd by some relatively unknown kid out of Southern Miss.\n\n30. Giants (28): Team that should be searching for next quarterback had to handle rookie Kyle Lauletta's \"traffic deal,\" per Pat Shurmur, during bye. Next.\n\n31. Bills (30): Team that believes it found its next quarterback can only hope rookie Josh Allen's elbow is sound enough to allow his return very soon.\n\n32. Raiders (32): Welp. At least it was entertaining reading Jon Gruden's lips Thursday and watching him side-eye defensive coordinator Paul Guenther.\n\n(Previous week's rank in parentheses)\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "These are the 5 best deals on Amazon right now\n\nGet great deals for the holidays.

(Photo: Jonathan Daniel, Getty Images)\n\nIf Joel Quenneville had been fired over the weekend, he might be the coach of the Los Angeles Kings today.\n\nCount on Quenneville rumors to ramp up related to the Florida Panthers or St. Louis Blues or any other team with a coach on the hot seat.\n\nThe best indication of whether Quenneville deserved to be fired by the Chicago Blackhawks today will be his popularity in the coaching market over the next couple of weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say Quenneville, 60, is the leading candidate to be hired for the next coaching vacancy. He ranks second all-time in wins with 890.\n\nGeneral manager Stan Bowman\u2019s decision to fire Quenneville and replace him with American Hockey League coach Jeremy Colliton, 33, had nothing to do with Quenneville\u2019s ability to coach.\n\nQuenneville is out of a job because this is the price to be paid for three Stanley Cup championships between 2010-15. When a team has that much success, top players receive lucrative contracts, depth erodes, players grow older, the process becomes stale and the coach gets fired. It's just what happens.\n\nMore: 29-year-old Coyotes GM John Chayka's bold moves starting to pay off\n\nMore: Members of Ottawa Senators apologize after video of them ripping coach, team goes public\n\nBut the Blackhawks are 6-6-3 and coming off a 33-39-10 season in which they missed the playoffs for the first time in Quenneville's 10-season tenure.\n\nBowman called it a \u201cdifficult\u201d decision, but the truth is that it was the best option he had to give the team an illusion of freshness.\n\n\u201cIt is in the best interests of the Blackhawks organization,\" Bowman said in a statement. \"We need to maximize each and every opportunity with our playoff goals in mind and create continued growth and development throughout our roster. After much deliberation the last several days, with great respect to what Joel has meant to the Blackhawks, we knew we had to make a change.\u201d\n\nThe change behind the bench isn\u2019t going to improve the Blackhawks\u2019 depth or bring a fountain of youth to Duncan Keith (35) and Brent Seabrook (33), two important defensemen. It won't clean up the Blackhawks\u2019 salary cap concerns.\n\nThe Blackhawks have six more seasons with Seabrook, and five with Keith and forwards Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews. That is more than $33 million in salary. The salary cap is $79.5 million this season. Those players aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nBut it is a new beginning for an organization that knows a reboot is coming. Colliton will be a new voice, and he offers a clean slate for the younger players on the team.\n\nThe Blackhawks were probably weary of Quenneville's approach. Colliton may appreciate some players more than Quenneville did. He may give more ice time to younger players. The change could mean more players being promoted from the AHL.\n\nBowman\u2019s job now will be to rebuild the team with those four players remaining on the roster. It won't be easy. The Blackhawks need a couple of young stars to jump-start the process, and that would require them to bottom out and earn an early draft pick.\n\nThis Chicago reboot could take a while. While that process is happening, Quenneville will be watching from behind another bench, probably with a more intriguing roster than he owned this season in Chicago.\n\nIt\u2019s probable that Coach Q will be back on top before the Blackhawks.", "CLOSE Relive some of the top moments of Week 9 in the NFL, including a huge matchup in the AFC North and a rough day for Matthew Stafford. USA TODAY Sports\n\nFox Sports announcer Troy Aikman walks on the field before the game between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. (Photo: Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTroy Aikman believes there's \"a lot of dysfunction\" within the Dallas Cowboys organization and recommended \"a complete overhaul\" rather than a simple coaching change.\n\nIn a radio interview on KTCK in Dallas on Tuesday morning, the Fox analyst described the Cowboys' loss to the Tennessee Titans on Monday night as \"a terrible loss,\" criticized the team for firing offensive line coach Frank Pollack at the conclusion of last season and indicated that there are significant issues in Dallas regardless of whether or not Jason Garrett remains its head coach.\n\n\"Go through the list and this team, over a long period of time, has been what it's been. It hasn't always mattered who the head coach has been,\" Aikman said on 1310 The Ticket, according to parts of the interview transcribed by The Dallas Morning News. \"So to me, if you're asking me, I'd say there has to be a complete overhaul of the entire organization. You can't just can't simply replace head coaches and say, 'Now it's going to be better.' No, it's been shown that it's not better.

The Cowboys are 3-5 with consecutive games on the road against Atlanta and Philadelphia up next.\n\nIn the radio interview, Aikman said he believes Jones' preference is to retain Garrett, but he also warned that \"Jerry has done things after seasons to at least give a fan base hope going into the following year.\"\n\nAikman, who won three Super Bowls with the Cowboys and has since been inducted into the Hall of Fame, then noted he believes there is a level of dysfunction within the organization that he believes goes beyond the head coach.\n\n\"I talk to people who have been inside the building and have a pretty good understanding of how things are run, and in a lot of ways there's a lot of dysfunction,\" Aikman said, according to The Dallas Morning News. \"And that has to change if this team is going to be able to compete on a consistent basis like the teams you look to around the league that seemingly are in the hunt each and every year.\"\n\nContributing: Jori Epstein\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "CLOSE Unless you\u2019re a political junkie, it\u2019s not easy keeping track of the seats up for election.

Ever since the 2014 \"Serial\" podcast and Netflix's \"Making a Murderer\" in 2015, we're in the midst of a boom in the genre. Audiences have been captivated by stories of unsolved murders, wrongful convictions and everything between. And with the recent debut of \"Making a Murderer Part 2\" (now streaming), the flood of docs shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nIf you've already devoured all 10 episodes of \"Murderer Part 2\" or are just looking for a new mystery, here are 10 great true-crime documentary films and series (and one hilarious parody) available to stream.\n\nMore: They're 'Keepers': True-crime documentaries surge on TV\n\n'The Keepers'\n\n\"Keepers\" is likely the best true-crime docuseries in the recent wave and certainly the best one Netflix has released. Ostensibly about the 1969 unsolved murder of Sister Cathy Cesnik, a nun and teacher, as investigated by her former students, the series is also about how power structures, including local governments and the Catholic Church, conspire to hide the truth and keep victims silent. Beyond exposing corruption, crimes and cover-ups, \"Keepers\" stands out because of the care and compassion with which the creators treat their subjects. Although the film graphically discusses horrifying topics such as child sexual assault, it never ventures into exploitative territory. Many documentaries are angering, but \"Keepers\" will take you far beyond anger. Its emotion is engulfing.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\n'Evil Genius: The True Story of America\u2019s Most Diabolical Bank Heist'\n\nEvil Genius: The True Story of America's Most Diabolical Bank Heist (Photo: Netflix, Netflix)\n\nIf you prefer more subtle docs that guide \u2013 rather than drag \u2013 you through the story, \"Evil Genius\" is not for you. But if you don't mind something less artfully done with a fantastic story, it's worth a try. Of all the \"stranger than fiction\" tales, \"Evil Genius\" might be the weirdest, chronicling the infamous 2003 \"pizza bomber,\" in which a delivery man in Erie, Pennsylvania, robbed a bank with a bomb strapped to his neck, claiming he was being forced to do so. The series lacks a nuanced take on the crime \u2013 it merely tells the story you might have heard on the news with far more detail, and without much objectivity \u2013 but it's captivating nonetheless.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\n'Wild Wild Country'\n\nNetflix's 'Wild, Wild Country' explored Oregon's Rajneeshee movement. (Photo: Netflix)\n\nAt first, this 2018 series doesn't seem like a a true-crime saga, but it unfolds into a twisty, conspiracy-laden thriller that surprises you at every turn. \"Country\" is an exhaustive look at what happened when a cult (the Rajneeshee community) purchased a swath of Oregon land in the 1980s to create a utopia. Things went very wrong in the nearby community and within the cult's own followers.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\n'The Sentence'\n\n\"The Sentence\" documentary subjects Annalis, Autumn, Ava. (Photo: HBO)\n\nHBO's recent documentary isn't a series, but it still packs an enormous punch in a single sitting. Rather than investigating a mystery, \"Sentence\" explores the devastating effect a prison sentence has on one woman's family over the course of a decade. Cindy Valdez was convicted of conspiracy for the crimes her late boyfriend committed while they lived together and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The documentary chronicles Cindy's time behind bars, her family's efforts to free her and the hardships her three daughters faced growing up without their mother. Directed by Cindy's brother Rudy, the film is intimate and shaking.\n\nStream it on HBOGo/Now.\n\n'The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst'\n\nRobert Durst is seen in an image from the HBO documentary \"The Jinx: The Life and Death of Robert Durst.\" (Photo: HBO)\n\nAlthough this 2015 HBO series was an early entrant into the recent true-crime wave, it remains one of the most revealing. The series dug into the case of Durst, the black-sheep son of a real-estate mogul, suspected of killing three people in a two-decade span. Without spoiling its bombshell ending, let's just say that the filmmakers were able to reveal more about their subject than he likely anticipated.\n\nStream it on HBOGo/Now.\n\nThe 'Paradise Lost' trilogy\n\nDirectors of the documentary motion picture \"Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory\" Joe Berlinger, left, and Bruce Sinofsky, sit with Damien Echols on death row in 2009.

But one thing that makes \"Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills,\" first film in HBO's trilogy about the West Memphis Three, so effective is that it doesn't take sides but simply acts as the objective voice in a case that didn't have many: the 1993 Arkansas murders of three young boys and the three teens convicted of the crimes, supposedly as part of a Satanic ritual. Directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky tip the tone more toward advocacy for the teens' innocence in the lesser follow-ups, \"Paradise Lost 2: Revelations\" (2000) and \"Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory (2011),\" but the story's happy ending makes all three movies must-watches.\n\nStream all three on HBOGo/Now, stream the first and third installments on Amazon.\n\n'The Staircase'\n\nMichael Peterson was accused of killing his wife, Kathleen.

Simpson and partly a history of race in 20th-century America. The greatest accomplishment of \"O.J.\" is telling a story we're all familiar with \u2013 Simpson's rise and fall \u2013 while adding something new to the narrative. Is it a movie or a TV show?

But going into Week 11, there was a change in the top four teams with the best chances to make the playoff, according to ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor, but it\u2019s a group we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nLast week, Georgia jumped into the top four and knocked Michigan out, but after Week 10\u2019s games \u2014 both the Bulldogs and Wolverines won on Saturday \u2014 they\u2019ve traded places again. So here are the four teams with the best shot at the playoff ahead of Week 11, per the Playoff Predictor.\n\n1. Clemson (9-0)\n\nPlayoff: 92 percent\n\nChampionship game: 63 percent\n\nWin championship: 35 percent\n\n2. Alabama (9-0)\n\nPlayoff: 86 percent\n\nChampionship game: 60 percent\n\nWin championship: 36 percent\n\n3. Notre Dame (9-0)\n\nPlayoff: 73 percent\n\nChampionship game: 18 percent\n\nWin championship: 5 percent\n\n4. Michigan (8-1)\n\nPlayoff: 50 percent\n\nChampionship game: 20 percent\n\nWin championship: 8 percent\n\nAt this point, Clemson and Alabama are pretty much locks for the playoff. Notre Dame is looking good at this point too, and while Michigan and Georgia are clearly the leaders in the battle for that fourth spot, Oklahoma, Ohio State and West Virginia are still in the hunt.\n\nAfter rocking Louisville, 77-16, the Tigers have ACC games against No. 17/14 Boston College and Duke left on their conference schedule, could lose both (they won\u2019t) and would still end up in the conference championship game. They also finish the regular season against South Carolina. Realistically, based on what we\u2019ve seen from Clemson in the last month or so, it should win all of these games by significant margins, including the ACC title game, which would currently be against Pitt. Even if it suffers an upset, a one-loss conference champion Clemson team is still likely in the playoff. The only thing that would be different is the seed.\n\nCompared with last week, the Tigers\u2019 likelihood changed only slightly, from a 93 percent chance to make the playoff and a 62 percent chance at the title game. Its 35 percent chance at winning a national championship didn\u2019t change.\n\nSame thing goes for the Crimson Tide, which flexed hard against then-No. 3/4 LSU on Saturday in a 29-0 win and locked itself into the SEC championship game against Georgia in a few weeks. An upset over Alabama somehow seems even less likely than against Clemson, and even though it takes on No. 18/15 Mississippi State this weekend, Nick Saban\u2019s team has shown it can steamroll anyone. But again, a one-loss Alabama team is definitely making the playoff.\n\nLast week, Clemson had both a better chance to make the championship game and win it all compared with Alabama, but that didn\u2019t last long. The Crimson Tide\u2019s chance of making the playoff is up from 82 percent, as is its shot at making the title game and defending its championship, from 56 percent and 33 percent, respectively.\n\nFor Georgia to get in \u2014 and for the SEC to have two representatives \u2014 it probably needs to be the team to take down the Crimson Tide and win the conference championship. The playoff has never invited a two-loss team to participate, so if Georgia loses in the SEC championship game, the Bulldogs are likely done. But upset Alabama, and the selection committee would have no choice but to invite a one-loss SEC champ to the playoff.\n\nDespite falling out of the top four this week, the Bulldogs are now No. 5 on the Playoff Predictor list and still have a 40 percent chance to make the playoff (down from 43 last week), a 19 percent chance at the title game (22 last week) and an eight percent chance to win it all (10 last week).\n\nWithout a conference championship to play for, Notre Dame is in a relatively safe position at No. 3 on this list, despite a challenge from Northwestern on Saturday. Should the Fighting Irish remain undefeated, they won\u2019t relinquish their playoff spot. A loss, however, could open the playoff race up to a second SEC or Big Ten team or the Big 12 conference champion.\n\nWhile Notre Dame\u2019s chances of advancing to the title game and winning it didn\u2019t change from last week, its playoff chances got a boost up from 65 percent.\n\nDepending on how the final few weeks of the regular season and the conference championship games play out, the fourth playoff spot is going to remain up for grabs.\n\nTwo weeks ago it was Michigan\u2019s, last week it was Georgia\u2019s and now it\u2019s back to the Wolverines\u2019, whose numbers got a big boost from last week after they crushed Penn State. Up to the No. 4 spot on the list, their playoff chances jumped from 37 percent last week, and their title game and national championship chances are up from 14 percent and six percent, respectively.\n\nAs is the case with several of these playoff hopefuls, Michigan needs to win out to get in because then its only loss would be to fellow playoff team Notre Dame. But it will have to beat Ohio State on the road in a couple weeks and then win the Big Ten championship game, which is looking like it will be against Northwestern, who almost beat the Wolverines in Week 4.\n\nHowever, things will get tricky for the selection committee if the Big Ten champion \u2014 assuming it\u2019s either Michigan or Ohio State \u2014 has two losses, and that would open the door for a two-loss SEC team \u2014 like if Georgia loses a close one against Bama in the conference title game \u2014 or a one-loss Big 12 champion.\n\nChaos in the Big Ten is what Oklahoma and West Virginia fans need to pray for. The Sooners have the sixth-best playoff chances (34 percent) while the Mountaineers are eighth but have just a five percent chance. Ohio State is sandwiched between them with a 16 percent chance.\n\nOverall, Michigan and Georgia are in a fight for that fourth playoff spot with Ohio State as an outside hopeful. But there\u2019s still a path for Oklahoma and West Virginia \u2014 they\u2019ll just need some help along the way.\n\nSee the top 25 teams in ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor list here.\n\nRead more about ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor from the preseason and after Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7, Week 8 and Week 9 on FTW.", "Around The Horn has been a mainstay on ESPN afternoons for 16 years now, and now that the Worldwide Leader\u2019s new studios in New York are up and running, it was time for the debate show to take the next step.\n\nOn Monday, the daily take on sports headlines and highlights hosted by Tony Reali started a new era with an sparkling new augmented reality set that allows the four competitors to float around a room while Reali can mute and score them from a new standing desk.\n\nAllow me to reintroduce myself\u2026 pic.twitter.com/sWRNIu0fHP \u2014 Around The Horn (@AroundtheHorn) November 5, 2018\n\nBefore the first episode on the new set, Reali delivered a passionate speech to his colleagues as if he was a coach in a locker room:\n\nBefore the NEW and IMPROVED Horn, @TonyReali gives us a pregame speech.

Between 2002 and 2016, marijuana use in pregnant women rose from 2.85 percent to almost 5 percent, according to data from the U.S. National Survey of Drug Use. Of the 12,000 women ages 18 to 44 surveyed, 3,500 who said they used the drug were in their first trimester of pregnancy, a critical time in a baby's development.\n\nThe results were reported in a research letter published this week in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\n\"Unlike alcohol and cigarette use, prenatal cannabis use has not decreased, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy, which is a key phase of neural development for the fetus,\" the letter's authors said.\n\nA plea to stop using prenatal marijuana\n\nThe letter's authors did not address why there was an uptick in prenatal use, but more states have relaxed laws on recreational marijuana and more are considering it. In a separate study published in JAMA, pregnant women self-reported using marijuana to treat severe nausea and vomiting.\n\nResearchers found that the rise in cannibis use among pregnant women was similar among various subgroups of women.\n\nThe letter's researchers also appealed to expectant mothers to stop using marijuana.\n\n\"Greater public awareness regarding the consequences of prenatal cannabis exposure in offspring health is necessary.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also warned expectant mothers that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical in cannabis, can harm a baby's development. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends women avoid the drug while pregnant or nursing a child.\n\nFewer pregnant women smoke, drink\n\nFewer pregnant women are drinking and smoking, according to federal data. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe data also showed a decrease in the percentage of pregnant women who say they are drinking and smoking.\n\nThe sharpest decline was in smoking with 17.5 percent of women in 2002 saying they smoked compared to 10.3 percent in 2016. Researchers noted that among black women ages 26 to 44 and women who did not finish high school, the decrease in smoking were less pronounced.\n\nAlcohol use has remained fairly consistent with about 10 percent of women saying they drank during pregnancy in 2002 and 8.5 percent saying they drank in 2016.\n\nStudies vary over how much alcohol is safe for a pregnant woman to drink, but heavy drinking can lead to fetal alcohol disorder.\n\nLike All the Moms?

(Nov. 6) AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump at a campaign rally on Nov. 5, 2018, in Cape Girardeau, Mo. (Photo: Jeff Roberson, AP)\n\nPresident Donald Trump misleadingly said \"the accuser of Brett Kavanaugh\" had \"admitted she never met him\" at a Monday rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.\n\nOne woman who had claimed to have sent an anonymous letter accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct did admit last week that she wasn't the author, but Trump's language appeared to imply that Christine Blasey Ford had changed her story.\n\nThe psychology professor has not deviated from her assertion at Kavanaugh's Sept. 27 confirmation hearing that she is \"100 percent\" certain Kavanaugh assaulted her while they were both high school students.\n\n\"You saw what happened on Friday also, we had great job numbers, but we also had something else: the accuser of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who is a fine man, the accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her. She made up the story,\" Trump said.\n\n\"It was false accusations, it was a scam, it was fake. It was all fake,\" he continued angrily, as the crowd began to chant, \"lock her up.\"\n\nThe president also suggested investigators \"look at the rest of them\" because Kavanaugh \"suffered\" as a result of the accusations.\n\nAt a rally in Indiana earlier Monday, Trump gave somewhat more context, saying \"one of\" Kavanaugh's accusers, as opposed to \"the accuser,\" had recanted.\n\nBecause Ford was by far the most-reported-on and best known Kavanaugh accuser, Trump's language could easily have been mistaken as referring to her. But he was actually referring to an accusation that received relatively little media attention.\n\nOn Friday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, referred Judy Munro-Leighton to the FBI for questioning after she took responsibility for a \"Jane Doe\" letter received by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Sept. 25 that accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault.\n\nMore: Takeaways from report on Kavanaugh allegations\n\nAccording to a report released last week by the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee, Munro-Leighton admitted to investigators on Thursday that she was not actually Jane Doe and had claimed that she was to \"get attention.\" She said she had never met Kavanaugh.\n\nGrassley has referred two other Kavanaugh accusers to the Justice Department for suspected false statements and obstruction.\n\nBut Ford and Deborah Ramirez, who alleges Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale University party, have not recanted their stories and the true author of the allegations in the \"Jane Doe\" letter remains unknown.\n\nIn addition to immigration and the economy, Trump has made the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh a central part of his closing argument heading to the midterms.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the attempts to derail Kavanaugh's confirmation \"fired up\" the Republican base. Democrats, on the other hand, believe the #MeToo movement and outrage over the fact Kavanaugh was confirmed despite the allegations against him will mobilize their own voters.\n\nTrump hones midterm campaign themes: Kavanaugh, impeachment, nicknames\n\nUSA TODAY/Suffolk poll: There is a 'Kavanaugh effect,' and it boosts Democrats more than the GOP in midterms\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/trump-misleading-claim-kavanaugh-accuser/1900324002/", "On Election Day 2018, we have our first big meme: \u201cMe voting in 2016 vs. me voting in 2018,\u201d in which Twitter users post two images (one happy, one grizzled) side-by-side, along with that caption.\n\nThere are so many different takes, but since we\u2019re For The Win, we focused on those that use sports to deliver the message.

(Photo: USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAs one of the most highly anticipated offseasons in the history of Major League Baseball gets underway, the big question on everyone's mind is where the top two free agents will land.\n\nFans have had their eyes on this winter for years, with Bryce Harper and Manny Machado both hitting the open market. Both will be 26 on opening day and are the kind of offensive superstars that can anchor a franchise.\n\nIn addition to the two sluggers, Craig Kimbrel, one of the top closers is available. Former Cy Young winner Dallas Keuchel is a free agent, and lefty Patrick Corbin, coming off his best career season, should command a big deal.\n\nThe USA TODAY Sports baseball team lays out its picks for where these top free agents will end up:\n\nManny Machado, SS/3B\n\nBob Nightengale \u2013 Yankees: Machado badly wants to play in New York, and the Yankees need him. The Yankees aren\u2019t afraid of his October antics knowing they have leaders to mentor him.\n\nGabe Lacques \u2013 Phillies: Sitting on piles of cash and ready to win.\n\nTed Berg \u2013 Yankees: Didi Gregorius\u2019 postseason Tommy John surgery opens up a hole on the left side of the Yankees\u2019 infield and makes Machado seem like a fairly obvious fit in the Bronx. GM Brian Cashman seems primed to make big plays in this free agent class after scrapping to get his payroll below the luxury-tax threshold, and Machado makes more sense than Harper for the Yankees in both the positional and sartorial senses.\n\nSteve Gardner \u2013 Phillies: A sniff of what it feels like to be a contender has stimulated the Phillies\u2019 appetite for winning. With relatively little money committed to the future and a gaping hole at shortstop, they can spend big on a franchise player like Machado.\n\nJesse Yomtov \u2013 Mets: This pick may sound a bit crazy, but one of the more more \"frugal\" organizations in the league has no salaries on the books beyond 2020. Ownership could choose to let the new front office team make a splash.\n\nScott Boeck \u2013 Yankees: Manny and the Bronx are made for each other. And with Didi Gregorius recently undergoing Tommy John elbow surgery on his right elbow, it opens the door for GM Brian Cashman to consider.\n\nBryce Harper, OF\n\nBob Nightengale \u2013 Nationals: He loves it there, and they love him. The Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants could swoop in.\n\nLacques \u2013 Dodgers: They need a new franchise player. He gets a record-setting deal and a mega-market platform close to home.\n\nBerg \u2013 Astros: This is a wild, albeit undoubtedly unlikely, thought. Harper, eager for something close to a guaranteed postseason opportunity and the best chance at a ring, surprises everyone by signing with the Astros over the coastal mega-market clubs most expect to pursue him. Though Harper doesn\u2019t patch the new holes in the Astros\u2019 starting rotation, he\u2019d give them a historically good lineup that\u2019d make them an instant favorite for 2019.\n\nGardner \u2013 Cubs: They already have more outfielders under contract than they need, but the Cubs\u2019 early exit from this year\u2019s playoffs make signing Harper necessary, and their substantial financial resources make it possible. Trading Kyle Schwarber to an AL team then becomes the next logical move.\n\nYomtov \u2013 Nationals: Harper and the Nats will realize they just can\u2019t live without each other. He\u2019s branded himself as Mr. DC and as the organization\u2019s first-ever star, Harper just doesn\u2019t have the same intrinsic value elsewhere.\n\nBoeck \u2013 Cubs: Harper has been flirting with the idea of teaming up with his BFF Kris Bryant. But the reality is that the Cubs probably can't afford Harper unless they dump salaries.\n\nPatrick Corbin, LHP\n\nCorbin had a 3.15 ERA in 2018. (Photo: Joe Camporeale, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNightengale \u2013 Yankees: He grew up in Syracuse, and comes from a family that has been Yankees fans for generations. Oh yeah, and the Yankees badly need him.\n\nLacques \u2013 Yankees: Importing arms is the best way to maximize their current window.\n\nBerg \u2013 Cubs: At 29 years old and coming off a career year, Corbin will almost undoubtedly represent the hottest starting-pitching commodity on the free-agent market. The Cubs appear more willing than most to spend big on long-term deals for starting pitching (with mixed results), and adding Corbin would strengthen their rotation as they look to win another title or two with the same core of young position players that took it all in 2016.\n\nGardner \u2013 Yankees: The most glaring offseason need in the Bronx is starting pitching \u2013 left-handed starting pitching in particular. Corbin fits the bill on all counts, and at age 29, he should still be reasonably effective into the latter stages of the multiyear deal he\u2019ll certainly command.\n\nYomtov \u2013 Yankees: Corbin is the top starting pitcher on the market, but some teams will understandably be skeptical of giving him a long-term deal. The Yankees can afford to take that risk in order to address the team's biggest shortcoming.\n\nBoeck \u2013 Phillies: After the Phillies fail to sign Harper or Machado, Corbin -- who was extended a qualifying offer from the Diamondbacks -- will fall right in line.\n\nCraig Kimbrel, RHP\n\nKimbrel saved 42 games for the Red Sox in 2018. (Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNightengale \u2013 Red Sox: He would love to go back home to Atlanta, but the Braves aren\u2019t going to fork over the same money as the Red Sox.\n\nLacques \u2013 Braves: They miss on the biggest targets, are left with lots of cash and spend it to shore up a weakness and assure Kimbrel enters Cooperstown a Brave.\n\nBerg \u2013 Braves: The closer\u2019s postseason shakiness might make it easier for the Red Sox to let him walk as they prioritize re-signing October heroes like Nate Eovaldi and Steve Pearce. The guess here is that the Braves bring Kimbrel home to fortify the back end of their bullpen as they look to turn their 2018 NL East title into the start of another dynasty.\n\nGardner \u2013 Cardinals: The Cards have tried a piecemeal approach to the back end of the bullpen the past few seasons and have seen it blow up in their faces. It may be worth overpaying to get someone who can lock down the closer\u2019s job once and for all.\n\nYomtov \u2013 Braves: They won the division with a shaky bullpen, but the NL East should be far more competitive in 2019 and bringing Kimbrel home would be the best way to erase that problem for the forseeable future.\n\nBoeck -- Cardinals: While his agent claims he's the best closer all-time, Kimbrel, at 30 years old, still has some solid years ahead of him, but not a price the Red Sox will want to pay.\n\nDallas Keuchel, LHP\n\nKeuchel won the AL Cy Young award in 2015. (Photo: Erik Williams, EUSA TODAY Sports)\n\nNightengale \u2013 Reds: Cincinnati has money to spend, needs a veteran pitcher, and Keuchel is the perfect fit to mentor young group of pitchers.\n\nLacques \u2013 Nationals: Lots of cash off the books, so they'll retrench around young bats and more arms.\n\nBerg \u2013 Angels: The sinkerballing lefty\u2019s strikeout rate and groundball rate both dropped in 2018, meaning the market for his services could wind up softer than normally expected for a pitcher of his age (30) and Cy Young pedigree. The Angels, with a seemingly perpetual need for healthy starters and some urgency to compete before Mike Trout\u2019s contract expires at the end of the 2020 season, seem to make sense.\n\nGardner \u2013 Nationals: Reeling from unexpectedly missing the playoffs and losing Harper in free agency, the Nats will look to retool their roster with an emphasis on starting pitching. The former Cy Young winner will give them a third ace for the rotation and a left-handed complement to Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.\n\nYomtov \u2013Yankees: With (at least) two glaring holes in the rotation, the Yankees should go all in to solidify their staff this winter. One of the best ground-ball pitchers in baseball, there should be no concerns Keuchel calling Yankee Stadium home\n\nBoeck \u2013 Nationals: Instead of investing on Harper, the Nats will look to add a third ace to a rotation that already includes Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.", "Terrell Owens throws popcorn in his face after scoring a touchdown against the Packers in 2007. (Photo: Mike Thomas, AP)\n\nThe NFL is a copycat league, they say.\n\nAnd imitating famous touchdown celebrations from years ago seems to be a thing now.\n\nThis is a very welcome development.\n\nOn Sunday, Michael Thomas replicated Joe Horn's famous cellphone celebration from 2003. Then, on \"Monday Night Football,\" the Titans' Kevin Byard channeled Terrell Owens' maneuver from 2000 by celebrating an interception on the Cowboys' midfield star logo.\n\nWe're on a real roll here.\n\nSo, which classic NFL celebrations do we most want to see mimicked next?\n\nFor your convenience, we made a list:\n\n13.

Terrell Owens: Cheerleader's pom-poms \u2014 This one took place after a 45-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Garcia during a late-season game against the Green Bay Packers in 2002. This was a fun little celebration, and didn't even earn T.O. a fine from the league.\n\n11. Chad Johnson: Cheerleader marriage proposal \u2014 Johnson's mock marriage proposal to a Ben-Gals cheerleader in 2005 was just one of a number of wild stunts pulled off by colorful receiver.\n\n10. Chad Johnson: Putting the ball with pylon \u2014 Johnson did his best Tiger Woods impression after scoring a touchdown in 2005.\n\n9. Steve Smith: Football diaper change \u2014 The 2005 season was a good time in the NFL, it seems. Smith's diaper change is among a handful a great touchdown celebrations from that year that show up on this list.\n\n8. Randy Moss: Moon over Lambeau \u2014 During a playoff game at Lambeau Field in January of 2005, Moss pulled off a move that had Joe Buck screaming, \"That is a disgusting act!\"\n\nRandy Moss bends over to the crowd after scoring a touchdown in an NFC wild-card playoff game against the Packers on Jan. 9, 2005. (Photo: Morry Gash, AP)\n\n7. Merton Hanks: Funky Chicken Dance \u2014 This was a recurring celebration during Hanks' nine-year NFL career, and it was inspired by the children's show \"Sesame Street.\"\n\n6. Steve Smith: Row the boat \u2014 Smith's sense of humor was on display after a touchdown against the Vikings in 2005. Of course, that was the year of the Vikings' infamous \"love boat\" scandal.\n\nNFL WEEK 9: 32 things we learned\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Chargers are to be feared\n\n5. Terrell Owens: Popcorn \u2014 Owens was known to say, \"Get your popcorn ready.\" During a Thursday night showdown against the Packers in 2007, Owens spotted a fan on the sidelines who just happened to have their popcorn ready.\n\n4. Chad Johnson: Future H.O.F. 20?? jacket \u2014 Like his 2000s WR counterpart, T.O., Johnson was never short on confidence. In the 2007 season opener on \"Monday Night Football,\" Johnson celebrated his first touchdown of the season by donning a Hall of Fame jacket. It seems very unlikely that Johnson -- who has been eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the previous two years -- will ever be inducted in Canton.\n\n3. Terrell Owens: Sharpie \u2014 A lucky fan got quite a souvenir after Owens scored a touchdown and autographed the ball during a Monday nighter in Seattle. This touchdown celebration happened in the fourth quarter. If you're wondering, he didn't play the whole game with a Sharpie in his sock.\n\n2. Chad Johnson: The Riverdance \u2014 The Bengals had a breakthrough season in 2005, winning the AFC North and reaching the playoffs for the first time since 1990. Johnson was a vital part of that success. As Johnson's on-field game was at its peak, so was his celebration game. Johnson's Irish jig made its appearance during a Week 3 win over the Bears at Soldier Field. Of all of his memorable celebrations, this is arguably his best. So simple, yet so cool.\n\n1. Billy \"White Shoes\" Johnson: Funky Chicken \u2014 This is throwing it back a ways, but in NFL lore this is as good as it gets as far as end zone celebrations. Johnson \u2014 one of the great return specialists in league history \u2014 was a pioneer when it came to end zone celebrations. So, not only would fans be treated to one of the game's most thrilling plays in a kick return touchdown, but Johnson would cap it with the \"Funky Chicken.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jim Reineking on Twitter @jimreineking.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Colliton replaces Joel Quenneville who was fired on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Kamil Krzaczynski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Joel Quenneville knew the deal. After three Stanley Cup titles and nine playoff appearances with the Chicago Blackhawks, the longtime coach figured this was a big season for him.\n\n\"I only think we're in the winning business and we better win,\" Quenneville said on the first day of training camp.\n\nTwo months later, it was over.\n\nThe Blackhawks fired Quenneville on Tuesday, ending a wildly successful run that returned the franchise to the top of the NHL after years of heartache.\n\n\"We want to win,\" team president John McDonough said. \"We want to re-win. We want our building filled and we want our fans to see an exciting brand of hockey. Sometimes, as painful as it is, you need a fresh start.\"\n\nThe move comes in the wake of a winless three-game trip, extending Chicago's losing streak to five in a row heading into Thursday's home game against Carolina. The power play, a persistent problem, ranked 27th in the NHL heading into Tuesday. The Blackhawks (6-6-3) also are allowing an unseemly 3.73 goals per game.\n\n\"A decision like this isn't made on one game, one play, or one specific thing,\" general manager Stan Bowman said. \"It's sort of a collection of things. Certainly the road trip was concerning. But I think even heading into that, there were some elements to our game where they weren't where they needed to be.\"\n\nAssistants Kevin Dineen and Ulf Samuelsson also were let go. Jeremy Colliton was hired as the 38th head coach in franchise history, and Barry Smith, 66, moved from Chicago's front office to the bench as an assistant coach.\n\nColliton goes from Chicago's American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford, Illinois, to the NHL's youngest head coach at 33. Blackhawks forward Chris Kunitz, defenseman Duncan Keith and goaltenders Corey Crawford and Cam Ward are older than Colliton, and defenseman Brent Seabrook also is 33.\n\n\"I have a huge amount of respect for Joel,\" Colliton said. \"Those are huge shoes to fill. I won't try to fill them. I've got to be myself. And we're different people, so I'll bring different things to the table, different ideas to the table.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old Quenneville was the longest-tenured head coach in the NHL. He had another year left on a three-year contract extension he signed in 2016 that pays him $6 million per year, second highest in the NHL behind Mike Babcock in Toronto.\n\nHe also was the second coach fired in the past three days after the Los Angeles Kings dismissed John Stevens.\n\nWhenever Quenneville wants to get back to work, he likely will have plenty of suitors.\n\nThe former NHL defenseman has 890 wins in 22 years as a head coach with St. Louis, Colorado and Chicago. Scotty Bowman, Stan's father and a senior adviser with the Blackhawks, is the only man with more regular-season victories.\n\nQuenneville took over Chicago four games into the 2008-09 season, replacing Denis Savard after the Hall of Famer was let go by former general manager Dale Tallon. What followed was an unprecedented run for one of the NHL's Original Six franchises.\n\nJonathan Toews, Patrick Kane, Keith and Seabrook blossomed with Quenneville behind the bench, and the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010, 2013 and 2015. They also made it to the conference finals in 2009 and 2014.\n\n\"He's going to be an icon in Chicago for the longest time, the great things he's done for this organization, winning three Stanley Cups, so that will never be forgotten,\" Kane said.\n\nToews said the players learned of the move Tuesday morning.\n\n\"We've had some pretty crazy highs and you remember all the good stuff, so it's tough to see a coach and a friend like Joel go,\" the captain said.\n\nThe pressure on Quenneville began to ramp up when Chicago was swept by Nashville in the first round of the 2017 playoffs after the Blackhawks finished with the best record in the Western Conference. Then they missed the playoffs entirely last season for the first time in a decade.\n\nQuenneville finishes with a 452-249-96 record with Chicago. He also went 76-52 in the playoffs with the Blackhawks for the best record in franchise history.\n\nThe dismissal turns up the heat on Bowman, who has made a couple of questionable moves that helped hasten the Blackhawks' decline. He traded Artemi Panarin to Columbus and Teuvo Teravainen to Carolina in part because of salary-cap issues, and each player has put up big numbers with his new club.\n\n\"I believe in this roster, I believe in Stan,\" McDonough said. \"Stan is meticulous, he's very thorough and when you break down free agents, when you break down trades, some work, some don't. You'd like most to go your way and over time, they may. But his body of work is excellent. I want him to succeed.\"\n\n___\n\nAP freelance reporter Matt Carlson contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul White) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 The last time a former Real Madrid great took over as coach, he led the club to three straight Champions League titles.\n\nSantiago Solari still has a long way to go to emulate former teammate Zinedine Zidane, but he can help his case for more time in charge when he makes his coaching debut in the competition at Viktoria Plzen on Wednesday.\n\nSolari is already following in Zidane's footsteps. The 42-year-old Argentine had been coaching Real Madrid's reserve team since 2016, taking over not long after Zidane left for the job with the main squad.\n\nSolari, who took over as interim coach following Julen Lopetegui's dismissal last month, has stabilized the team and won both games since taking charge. Two more victories in games against Viktoria Plzen and then Celta Vigo in the Spanish League could end talk of Antonio Conte or Roberto Martinez being brought in.\n\nMadrid was in crisis when Solari arrived, enduring a run that included five losses in seven matches in all competitions, culminating in the 5-1 humbling by Barcelona.\n\nSolari's first job was to get the side winning again - so far, so good - and to put the team within sight of the Champions League knockout stages, which it can reach for the 22nd year in a row.\n\nSolari has turned to youth to invigorate his demoralized side, and has pleased fans by bringing in Brazilian teenager Vinicius Junior, who had been relegated to the \"B'' team under Lopetegui.\n\nSolari also didn't hesitate to use young fullbacks Alvaro Odriozola and Sergio Reguilon in defense while the regular starters were injured. Both are expected to start in Plzen.\n\nMadrid's defense has already improved, with two consecutive clean sheets. The team had conceded 10 goals in its last seven matches under Lopetegui.\n\nGroup leader Roma visits CSKA Roma earlier.\n\nA look at the four Champions League groups on Wednesday:\n\nGROUP E\n\nBayern Munich is hoping it fares better in November than October, when it failed to impress despite bouncing back from a four-game winless run with four wins in a row.\n\nThat was ended by modest Freiburg in a 1-1 draw in the Bundesliga on Saturday, again shining a light on what has been a long series of poor performances.\n\nBayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is also under scrutiny after conceding in each of his last four games in the Bundesliga. The Germany goalkeeper has only saved half the shots on goal he has faced so far in the league.\n\nBayern can quell talk of a crisis with a commanding performance against AEK Athens and can even reach the knockout stages with a win if Benfica loses to visiting Ajax in the other group game.\n\nAjax, which leads Group E with seven points from three games, needs to win to ensure progress, while Bayern, which is level on points, is looking for more than just a result against the group's last-place team.\n\nGROUP F\n\nLyon striker Memphis Depay has been making headlines ahead of a rematch with Hoffenheim.\n\nDepay, who joined from Manchester United last year, said last week he did not feel like a respected player after being left out of the starting lineup for the league game against Angers.\n\nDepay sulked on the sidelines during warmups and was used as a second-half substitute, setting up Lyon's opening goal before scoring three minutes from time for a 2-1 win.\n\n\"I think I deserve more respect. I deserve better than that and I should play every game,\" Depay said.\n\nLyon coach Bruno Genesio had left Depay out after he criticized teammates following the 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Genesio has yet to decide whether to field Depay or Moussa Dembele up front on Wednesday.\n\nGroup leader Manchester City will advance with a win at Shakhtar Donetsk if Hoffenheim loses.\n\nGROUP G\n\nRoma, like Real Madrid, aims to make its progress all but clear with a win at CSKA Moscow, which it defeated 3-0 in Rome. Both Roma and Madrid have six points from three games.\n\nBut CSKA is only two points behind and will be hoping to replicate the home form that took it to a 1-0 win over Madrid last month. Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez returned from injury last week but promptly hurt his thigh in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Dynamo Moscow.\n\nCSKA fans are expected to honor their fellow supporters who were injured when an escalator in Rome malfunctioned as they traveled to the first Roma game.\n\nViktoria Plzen, with one point, will be knocked out if it loses and Roma wins its game.\n\nGROUP H\n\nJuventus can progress with another win over Manchester United after its 1-0 win in England. The Italian champions have three wins from three games and are enjoying their best ever start to a Serie A season.\n\nManchester midfielder Paul Pogba will be facing his former team.\n\n\"It's where I developed as a player so I've huge respect for this team and this club,\" Pogba said. \"I'm delighted to be going back and playing there.\"\n\nValencia hosts Young Boys in the other group game and will be hoping for a favor from Juventus.

Those proposals include nothing about age limits for the president.\n\nHelleland, who currently serves as WADA vice president, cast one of two dissenting votes when the WADA executive committee voted to reinstate Russia. She has been an outspoken critic of WADA's leadership and has presented herself as a candidate who would put athletes front and center in the WADA process.\n\nThe athletes said regardless of who came up with the idea, it represents a shifting of the goal posts as the campaign begins.\n\n\"Whether this move was initiated by WADA leadership or management, or whether it was initiated by members of WADA's Boards, this is irrelevant,\" they wrote. \"It is WADA's duty to lead, and leadership requires having a finger on the pulse of public and athlete opinion.\"\n\nU.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart called it \"an obvious attempt to rig the election so the reform candidates can't run.\"\n\n\"It's ludicrous,\" he said. \"Joan of Arc turned a war around at 17 and Queen Elizabeth became queen at 25, but to be WADA president, you need to be 45?

(Photo: JACK GRUBER, USA TODAY)\n\nAbrams' camp has for days said it would push for a runoff if neither candidate reached 50 percent of the vote.\n\nThe voting process itself became a major issue, with Kemp accusing Democrats of trying to hack into the state's voting system and Abrams charging that Kemp, who is secretary of state, was trying to suppress turnout among minority voters.\n\nA group of Georgia voters filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Atlanta to stop Kemp from presiding over the election because of concerns about his fairness.\n\nCommon Cause, a member of the Election Protection coalition, said early Tuesday that it had received reports of \u201cvoting machines going down in large numbers across the state.\u201d\n\nThe technical problems combined with large turnout to create delays of several hours for some voters.

I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nGillum was trying to become the first black governor in Florida history and the first Democratic governor in the Sunshine State since 1994.\n\nThe win in Florida was an important one for President Donald Trump, who gave DeSantis an early endorsement and visited Florida in the final week of the campaign.\n\nAt his victory party in Orlando, DeSantis thanked Trump for backing his campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank the president for standing by me when it wasn\u2019t necessarily the smart thing to do,\u2019\u2019 DeSantis said, according to the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cAs governor, I will fight the good fight; I will keep the faith.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Republican Governor\u2019s Association touted DeSantis' win.\n\n\u201cThe Florida governorship was the biggest prize of the night for Democrats, but despite the national media attention, and millions of dollars pumped into the state by the DGA, Tom Steyer, George Soros and other far-left groups, Florida voters rejected Gillum and his radical policies,\u201d Republican Governor\u2019s Association Executive Director Paul Bennecke said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Kevin Stitt won the governor's race in Oklahoma in another race considered a toss-up, one of dozens of races for governor that did not see a change of political parties at the helm.\n\nKansas and Oklahoma featured elections to replace term-limited Republican governors \u2013 Sam Brownback in Kansas and Mary Fallin in Oklahoma \u2013 whose experiments in severe tax cuts left their states reeling.\n\nIn Ohio, Republicans maintained state control, with Mike DeWine winning over Democrat Richard Cordray.

Thirty-four states have one-party control of the governor's office and both legislative bodies \u2013 26 are all Republican and eight are all Democratic.\n\nAgain, the makeup of state government becomes crucial when the results of the 2020 census are used to draw new maps for the U.S. House seats in each state. Those new maps will first be used in the 2022 election.\n\nThe GOP controlled much of the map-drawing after the 2000 census, giving the party a large structural advantage, experts say. The Brennan Center for Justice estimated in a report in March that Democrats would have to win the overall vote for House seats by 11 percentage points to recapture control of the body.\n\nContributing Naples Daily News\u2019 Ana Ceballos and USA TODAY\u2019s Christal Hayes.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/midterm-elections-governors-gillum-desantis-abrams-kemp/1810897002/", "CLOSE All but one of the biggest Grammy awards went to men, and artists like Pink and Halsey are not OK with the response from the president of the Recording Academy.

Concerts that deserved a do-over. Trends that disappointed listeners.\n\nNot every major musical moment of 2018 hit its mark this year, from the several notable releases that weren\u2019t as revelatory as expected \u2013 featuring Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and two letdowns from Kanye West \u2013 to the disappointing charts and radio demographics that fans hoped, in vain, would improve from 2017.\n\nThe 2018 Grammy Awards\n\nIn retrospect, 2018\u2019s year in music was disappointing from the get-go, with January\u2019s Grammy Awards extinguishing any hopes that the dinosaur of a music institution had evolved into a forward-thinking awards show. The diverse slate of Grammy nominees had fans thinking that, perhaps, the Recording Academy was adapting to the times and was ready to recognize hip-hop or Spanish-language music with wins in the night\u2019s three major categories.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen. Bruno Mars swept the album, record and song of the year categories, snubbing more critically acclaimed nominees like Kendrick Lamar. Even more insulting were Grammys president Neil Portnow after the show, saying that female artists \u2013 who were nominated for barely any televised awards during the ceremony \u2013 needed to work harder to gain equal footing in the industry and that the show didn\u2019t have time to feature a performance by Lorde, the only woman nominated for album of the year.\n\nMore: 'Music's biggest night'? The 2018 Grammys were an out-of-touch embarrassment\n\nJustin Timberlake\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show\n\nTimberlake needed a win with his halftime performance at the 2018 Super Bowl. His album \u201cMan of the Woods,\u201d released the week before the show, was rebuked by critics; rumors that Timberlake was going to bring out a Prince hologram to the Super Bowl\u2019s Minneapolis arena were criticized by the late singer\u2019s fans; and his famously disastrous appearance at Janet Jackson\u2019s 1994 halftime performance made the stakes that much higher for his own show.\n\nAlas, things could\u2019ve gone better for Timberlake that fateful Sunday night. Sound problems plagued his performance; his Prince tribute \u2013 and questionable camouflage suit \u2013 drew jeers from social media; and the headlines the next day were dominated by the child he wrangled in the audience to take a cellphone video with him. And the actual songs he played, as well as any of his performance\u2019s other big flashy moments, are lost to memory.\n\nMore: Compared with Prince's, Justin Timberlake's halftime show was a joke\n\nKanye West\u2019s \u201cYe\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just \u201cYe,\u201d Kanye West\u2019s seven-song album from June, that landed with a thud. West\u2019s album wasn\u2019t just supposed to be the return of a king \u2013 it was part of a multi-album rollout from West\u2019s G.O.O.D. Music label, alongside new releases from Pusha-T, Nas, Teyana Taylor and the much-anticipated reunion of West with his friend and collaborator Kid Cudi. And while Pusha\u2019s \u201cDaytona\u201d release arrived on time and was praised by critics, the same couldn\u2019t be said for the other albums in the series, which either dropped hours or days behind schedule, were panned by reviewers, or both.\n\nBut \u201cYe\u201d was a particular kind of disappointment, the first Kanye West album that truly felt dead on arrival, failing to produce any successful singles or produce any meaningful commentary.\n\n...and Kanye West's \"Yandhi\"\n\nThe underwhelming reception of \"Ye\" may have explained why West scheduled another album release for November, teasing an additional album \"Yandhi\" and blowing past its announced release date before Kim Kardashian promised it would actually arrive on Black Friday.\n\nUnfortunately for Kanye fans, the rapper apparently had a change of heart after performing with Kid Cudi on Sunday, tweeting that he needed more time to refine his new music, meaning that a new album likely won't be arriving on Nov. 23 as promised.\n\n\"It felt so good being on the stage last night with my brother Cudi,\" he wrote. \"After performing again, I realize the new album I\u2019ve been working on isn\u2019t ready yet. I\u2019ll announce the release date once it\u2019s done. Thank you for understanding.\"\n\nMore: Is Kanye West still a creative genius? Not on 'Ye,' his misguided new album\n\nBeyonce and Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Carters\u201d collaboration\n\nIt\u2019s become near-anathema to say anything publicly negative about Queen Bey and her creative endeavors. And yet \u201cThe Carters,\u201d Beyonce and Jay-Z\u2019s album that arrived by surprise in June on the heels of their On The Run II tour, didn\u2019t make quite the splash of Beyonce\u2019s previous releases.\n\nDespite largely positive reviews from critics and a reasonably successful single, \u201cApe****,\u201d \u201cThe Carters\u201d never quite reached \u201cLemonade\u201d levels of cultural conversation \u2013 perhaps, to give the Carters some credit, because it wasn\u2019t intended to be a powerhouse release at the level of Bey\u2019s solo albums. Still, it\u2019s strange that, looking back on 2018 in review, an event as seemingly major as a new Beyonce release didn\u2019t move the needle in the year\u2019s cultural conversations.\n\nMore: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z drop joint album 'Everything Is Love,' Twitter explodes with excitement\n\nCountry radio\u2019s continued dismissal of female artists\n\nLast year wasn't great for country fans hoping to hear their favorite women on the genre's radio stations; 2017 featured the lowest percentage of female artists on the radio since 1994. The conversation about female voices on country radio has been a major topic in Nashville since 2015's infamous \"Tomatogate\" controversy, in which a radio consultant named Keith Hill, reacting to research showing the low percentage of women on country radio, said that female artists were the \"tomatoes of our salad\" and that men were the lettuce.\n\nThree years later, and statistics haven't improved much for women on country radio. h new Statistics released in June showed that the percentage of purely female country songs charted on the radio by Country Aircheck dropped to 10.4 last year, down from 13 percent in 2016.\n\nAmong the voices in Nashville reacting with frustration at the statistics was Maren Morris, the Grammy-winning singer hailed as one of the genre's brightest new stars. \"Enough 'women don\u2019t want to hear other women,' or 'women don\u2019t test well with ballads,' or 'singles from new women artists aren\u2019t reacting,'\" she tweeted, naming other female country artists that she felt deserved more radio play. \"Look at RaeLynn, look at Cassadee Pope, look at Lindsay Ell.

(Photo: David Banks, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nFor the first time since the 2007-08 season, the Chicago Blackhawks will not have Joel Quenneville behind the bench.\n\nThe Blackhawks announced Tuesday the shocking decision to fire their longtime coach after a 6-6-3 start and disappointing 33-39-10 campaign last season. The Blackhawks simply were not showing the spark that general manager Stan Bowman was looking for at the start of the season.\n\nQuenneville is being replaced by Jeremy Colliton.\n\n\"This is certainly a very difficult decision. But I believe it is in the best interests of the Blackhawks organization,\" Bowman said in a statement.\n\n\"We need to maximize each and every opportunity with our playoff goals in mind and create continued growth and development throughout our roster at the same time. After much deliberation the last several days, with great respect to what Joel has meant to the Blackhawks, we knew we had to make a change.\"\n\nMore: Fired Joel Quenneville will be the Blackhawks' gift to another team in the NHL\n\nQuenneville compiled a 452-249-96 record in 10-plus seasons as the Blackhawks' coach. He led them to three Stanley Cup titles and into the playoffs in each year except for last. Quenneville, nicknamed \"Coach Q,\" owns a .594 playoff winning percentage with the Blackhawks.\n\nBut in an ultra-competitive Western Conference, Bowman felt he had to act now to get his team going. The Blackhawks have lost five games in a row.\n\n\"All of those associated with Jeremy (Colliton) strongly believe he possesses many of the tools that will make him a successful head coach in this league,\" Bowman said. \"He has been very impressive as a communicator, a leader, and coach. He knows the Blackhawks system, understands our players and our culture and we believe he gives us the best opportunity to have success and grow as a team.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old Quenneville ranks second all-time in wins behind Scotty Bowman with 890 in 1,636 games. Prior to joining the Blackhawks, he spent eight seasons as coach of the Blues and three with the Avalanche.\n\nChicago is sixth in the Central Division.", "5 of the funniest, most awkward and most touching moments in People's Choice Awards history\n\nA bonus wild People's Choice Awards moment: When Kevin James hosted in 2002, he copied Bjork's famous swan dress.

I am truly fantastic and an honor to work with.\"\n\n2. Vin Diesel gave a touching tribute to his late costar, Paul Walker\n\nWhile accepting the award for Favorite Movie in 2016 on behalf of \"Furious 7,\" Vin Diesel got emotional mentioning his co-star Paul Walker, who died in a car accident on Nov. 30, 2013.\n\n\"My only message to you is: You would be amazed what you can do with love,\" Diesel said. \"You'd be amazed how powerful a force that is. We didn't want to come back to filming when the tragedy was too heavy -- it was the love of everyone combined that saw us through to the end.\"\n\nThe actor finished his speech singing a portion of Wiz Khalifa's \"See You Again\": \"It's been a long day without you my friend / And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again.\"\n\n3. Ellen DeGeneres breaks a PCA record\n\nWho else would hold the record for most People's Choice Awards wins?\n\nIn 2017, Ellen DeGeneres became first person in the award show's history to be awarded 20 trophies, with wins in three separate categories that year: Favorite Daytime TV Host, Favorite Comedic Collaboration and Favorite Animated Movie Voice.\n\n\"She's the most decorated winner in People's Choice history,\" singer Justin Timberlake said while introducing her. \"She is one of my very good friends. I love her so much. She is one of the best people on this planet and no one else is more deserving.\"\n\nDeGeneres gave her acceptance speech in the most extravagant way possible: surrounded by men in white gloves carrying all of her past trophies.\n\n\"This is amazing: 20,\" she marveled. \"I mean, 17, I get it. 18, sure. 19, I can see that. But 20 is outrageous. This is really something that means more to me... because it comes from the people.\"\n\n4. Nick Cannon helped Maria Carey waddle her way to the stage\n\nWhen Maria Carey's name was called as the 2010 winner of Favorite R&B Artist, she was slow to get up \u2013 not because she was shocked, because her dress was a bit too tight.\n\nIt was Nick Cannon to the rescue \u2013 Carey's then-husband escorted her to the stage as she struggled up the steps in her floor length mermaid-style gown.\n\n\"I especially want to thank my husband Nick,\" she said toward the end of her acceptance speech. \"Thank you Nick, especially for helping me with this dress, because it's a drama. I didn't mean to do this.\"\n\n5. Olivia Munn jokingly pulled a Kanye\n\nMost of the fans in the crowd of the 2013 PCAs were pretty excited when Taylor Swift was awarded Favorite Country Singer (remember when Taylor Swift was a country singer?).\n\nBut one person onstage seemed decidedly not thrilled: award presenter Olivia Munn.\n\n\"If you want to thank me first, it would make sense,\" Munn deadpanned to Swift, before reluctantly handing over the trophy... and then taking it back.\n\n\"This always happens,\" Swift said, referring to four years prior, when Kanye West infamously jumped onstage at the VMAs to interrupt Swift's acceptance speech and proclaim \"Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time.\"\n\n\"And it will always happen, Taylor,\" Munn responded. \"This is your lot in life...

(Oct 10) AP\n\nAfter more than a decade of strict political neutrality, Taylor Swift has been making up for lost time by openly discussing politics recently, and she isn't slowing down on Election Day.\n\nIn a series of Instagram Story videos posted Tuesday, the \"Reputation\" songstress said people shouldn't underestimate young voters and urged her followers to get out and vote.\n\n\"I'm seeing a lot of underestimation of young voters and this new generation who now have the right to vote just in the last couple of years, but these are people who grew up post 9/11, they grew up with school shooting drills at their schools,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are people who want to vote.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just want change.

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 Manchester City created a shell company for a commercial deal to disguise tens of millions of dollars in income from UEFA investigators, according to club documents cited by a German magazine.\n\nDer Spiegel cites internal Man City correspondence to show the team's holding company, state-backed Abu Dhabi United Group, paid the shell firm to \"buy\" player image rights from the club.\n\nThe magazine reported that Man City officials detailed a long-term search for \"creative solutions\" to hiding expenses and evading UEFA monitoring of spending on players.\n\nMan City risked Champions League expulsion in 2014 if a UEFA club finance panel had found it had severely breached \"Financial Fair Play\" rules, designed to curb overspending on player costs. Critics say FFP protects storied clubs from ambitious rivals with new and wealthy owners.\n\nDer Spiegel is leading the Europe-wide publication of the \"Football Leaks\" documents.\n\nIn recent days, European media have detailed plans shaped by Real Madrid for a breakaway European Super League kicking off in 2021, and how FIFA President Gianni Infantino has intervened in its independent ethics committee's work.\n\nDer Spiegel also reported last Friday that Man City threatened to destroy UEFA with legal action before reaching a 2014 settlement to forfeit 20 million euros ($22.8 million) in prize money.\n\nMan City has not disputed the authenticity of the documents, and said an \"attempt to damage the club's reputation is organized and clear.\"\n\nAsked about what was reported in Der Spiegel, Man City manager Pep Guardiola said Tuesday: \"Of course I trust the club, what they have done. Of course we want to follow the rules. UEFA, FIFA and the Premier League, they do what they have to do. Believe me, I'm completely honest, I don't know what happened, I'm a manager, focused on the pitch, the locker room.\"\n\n\"I'm part of the club, I support the club,\" added Guardiola, who was speaking at a news conference ahead of City's Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday. \"We want to do what we have to do in terms of the rules.\"\n\nSince Man City was bought with Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth in 2008, a team long in the shadows of more glamorous Manchester United has overtaken its rival on the field.\n\nCity achieved this spending more than 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) to win a first Premier League title in 2012.\n\nThis rise coincided with UEFA creating rules \u2014 in consultation with the European Club Association \u2014 to limit spending within a club's ability to generate revenue.\n\nDer Spiegel cited Man City documents in which officials wrote: \"Without significant additional revenues ... UEFA FFP compliance WILL NOT be achieved.\"\n\nCity CEO Ferran Soriano complained in one memo that ECA members were pushing for the UEFA rules \u2014 which many thought could curb the rise of Man City and Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\"We will need to fight this,\" Soriano wrote, according to the magazine, \"and do it in a way that is not visible, or we will be pointed out as the global enemies of football.\"\n\nMan City apparently wanted to shift some costs away from the club and helped set up a shell company called Fordham Sports Management with two British investors. It was supposedly used as a vehicle to disguise payments to players for the right to use their image in marketing campaigns.\n\nDer Spiegel said this helped turn almost 30 million euros ($34 million) into revenue instead of a cost, for the purpose of UEFA's investigation of club accounts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in Washington, D.C., on June 28, 2018. (Photo: Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Democrats were on track to win a majority of House seats in Tuesday's midterm elections, ending unified Republican rule in Washington.\n\nWith 218 seats needed for a majority, Democrats have won 219 and the Republicans 193, with winners undetermined in 23 races, according to a tally from the Associated Press. Democrats notched key wins in suburban districts from Virginia to Colorado to Florida.\n\n\"Tomorrow will be a new day in America,\" Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told an ebullient crowd at a Democratic election watch party in Washington Tuesday night.\n\nTaking the stage to loud chants of \u201cspeaker! speaker!\u201d Pelosi said the new Democratic majority would take \u201cstrong legislative action\u201d to lower the price of prescription drugs, invest in infrastructure and \u201cdrain the swamp of dark interest money.\u201d\n\nShe did not mention possible investigations of the president or aggressive oversight of his administration, although she said the Democratic win was about \"restoring the constitutional checks and balances to the Trump administration.\"\n\nTuesday's victory will indeed give Democrats a major lever of power. With Democrats in the majority, they can use Congress\u2019 aggressive oversight powers to demand Trump\u2019s tax returns, subpoena his Cabinet members and investigate alleged corruption across the executive branch. And they can block the president\u2019s legislative priorities, whether it\u2019s funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border or curbing entitlement programs.\n\nDemocrats needed a net gain of 23 House seats to wrest control of the House from Republicans. As of Wednesday morning, Democrats were on track to win at least 29 seats, riding a wave of anti-Trump angst in suburban districts, where women voters in particular were uneasy with the president's tenure.\n\nWomen candidates helped lead the Democratic gains. At least 80 women had been elected to the House, as of 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Sixty-nine of the House women are Democrats, including 27 of 28 newcomers, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton, a state senator, toppled incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, according to The Associated Press. Comstock tried to distance herself from Trump, but she fell short in a well-to-do suburban district that has become increasingly Democratic.\n\nIn Colorado, incumbent GOP Rep. Mike Coffman lost to Democrat Jason Crow, a lawyer and combat veteran, in another suburban House race. In Florida, Democrats knocked off incumbent GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo and snagged an open seat held by longtime incumbent GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring.\n\nIn suburban Philadelphia, Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon was declared the winner in another open seat held by ex-GOP Rep. Pat Meehan, who resigned amid questions about alleged misconduct toward a junior female staffer. Scanlon, a former school board member and attorney, also benefited from a court-ordered redistricting decision that made the district significantly more Democratic. She defeated former Republican prosecutor Pearl Kim in November.\n\nGOP Rep. Pete Session, whose district includes the wealthy Dallas suburbs, lost to Colin Allred, a civil rights attorney and former player for the NFL\u2019s Tennessee Titans in Texas\u2019 32nd District. Sessions is chairman of the powerful Rules Committee and led the National Republican Congressional Committee when it made historic gains in 2010. He had not faced a competitive race in years.\n\nWhile many of the Republicans who were knocked-off were centrists, a handful of conservatives in once thought-to-be safe GOP districts found they would not be returning to Washington next year.\n\nIn Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, Democrat former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger scored a major upset, ousting conservative GOP Rep. Dave Brat in a race that was surprisingly competitive for a district that has been reliably red. Brat knows about upsets. In 2014, he defeated then-GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary. President Donald Trump carried this seat by 7 percentage points in 2016.\n\nDemocrats gained a seat in Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District, a blue-collar swing seat currently represented by arch conservative GOP Rep. Rod Blum and carried by Trump by 3 percentage points in 2016. Democrat Abby Finkenauer, a 29-year-old state representative, is slated to become the first woman ever elected to the House from Iowa.\n\nRep. Claudia Tenney fell to Anthony Brindisi, a New York state assemblyman, in New York\u2019s 22nd District. Tenney had aligned herself closely with the president, who won the district by more than 15 points.\n\nThere was at least one pickup for Republicans. Minnesota\u2019s 8th District elected Republican Pete Stauber, a retired police commander, former professional hockey player and county commissioner. He beat Democrat Joe Radinovich, who served in the Minnesota House. (In Minnesota, the Democrats are the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party.)\n\nTwo indicted Republicans, Californian Duncan Hunter and New York state\u2019s Chris Collins, both won their re-election bids.\n\nHunter and his wife Margaret face a 60-count federal indictment alleging conspiracy, wire fraud and misspending and falsification of campaign finance records. Collins is accused of insider trading. Party leaders asked him to withdraw, but he decided to stay in the race.\n\nRepublicans fended off stiff challenges in some more conservative districts. In Kentucky, for example, GOP Rep. Andy Barr defeated Democrat and former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath. The district, which includes Lexington and Frankfurt, shouldn\u2019t have been competitive. Trump won it by 15 percentage points in 2016. But McGrath turned it into a tight race, attracting national attention with viral TV ads, including one that showcased her 89 combat missions. The AP declared Barr the winner.\n\nThe president's party generally loses seats in midterm elections. In 2006, President George W. Bush called the election results \u201ca thumping\u201d when his party lost 30 House seats and six Senate seats, turning control of both chambers over to Democrats and ushering in the first woman House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. President Barack Obama, in 2010, called it a \u201cshellacking\u201d when Democrats lost 63 seats \u2013 and control of the House \u2013 and six Senate seats amid the rise of the tea party movement\n\nTuesday's results also set the stage for the 2020 presidential campaign. A GOP victory would have put Trump in a strong position to win a second term and cement his control over the Republican Party. But the Democratic victory is expected to energize the so-called liberal \"resistance\" and buoy a party still grappling with Trump\u2019s surprise win in 2016.\n\nTrump spent the closing days of the 2018 campaign escalating his anti-immigrant rhetoric and portraying Democrats as soft on immigration. He vowed to close the border with Mexico, claimed a caravan of migrants included unknown \u201cMiddle Easterners,\u201d and threatened to build \u201ctent cities\u201d to block people from entering the country.\n\nDemocrats said Trump was using fear to motivate GOP voters. They channeled much of their energy and ad dollars to talking about health care \u2013 blasting Republican for their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and unravel protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThose themes were on voters minds as they went to the polls, according to a Washington Post-Schar School survey of conducted Monday and Tuesday in battleground districts across the country. The survey found that 44 percent of voters said health care was the most important factor in casting their ballot, while 43 percent said Trump was the top issue driving their decision. Immigration and the economy ranked about 10 percentage points lower, the Post-Schar data showed.\n\nThe humming economy did not seem to help Republicans the way they had hoped. The Democrats saw gains in areas where the economy is booming and unemployment is low.\n\nMore: What's at stake in the midterms?

Plenty of one-and-done-caliber freshmen enter the NCAA ranks as super athletic but aren\u2019t necessarily great shooters. Not Langford, who will be a marksmen right off the bat.

Barrett, Duke. The smooth 6-7 lefty is projected as the No. 1 pick in 2019\u2019s NBA draft for a reason and he\u2019ll be the alpha dog on a Duke team that also hauled in the two other top-rated freshmen. What\u2019s most impressive about Barrett outside of his versatility on both ends is his ability to make others better \u2014 by facilitating or injecting energy. More than anything, Barrett will have international playing experience as an obvious strength. The Canadian led his national team to the 2017 U-19 World Cup over the United States thanks to a 38-point, 13-rebound performance. In other words, there won\u2019t be much of an adjustment period for the teenager to excel at the NCAA level.\n\nF Dedric Lawson, Kansas. The 6-9 transfer from Memphis immediately gives Bill Self size and tenaciousness in the paint that was missing all of last season. He nearly averaged a triple double with 19.2 points and 9.9 rebounds a game in 2016-17, and will be a key cog in the Jayhawks\u2019 quest to win a 15th consecutive Big 12 regular-season title \u2014 and perhaps KU\u2019s first national title since \u201908.\n\nG Tyus Battle, Syracuse. The 6-6 guard averaged 19.2 points a game for a depleted Orange roster that overachieved all the way to the Sweet 16 last March.

An injured Hunter watched on the sidelines as his teammates were on the wrong side of history last March, as UVa was shocked by No. 16 seed Maryland-Baltimore County. The freshman sixth man\u2019s omission was telling for how important he was on last year\u2019s 31-win roster, and he\u2019ll step into an even larger role as a sophomore. His athleticism, knack for scoring and defensive versatility are traits that will elevate him to being coach Tony Bennett\u2019s most valuable asset in 2018-19.\n\nF Caleb Martin, Nevada. The 6-7 forward showed off his takeover abilities in last year\u2019s NCAA tournament run, and with the Wolf Pack stepping further into the national spotlight this season (courtesy of even more talent coming in), Martin (18.9 ppg in \u201917-18) will be the main piece to elevating this mid-major into a force to be reckoned with come March.\n\nREBUILDING: Defending champ Villanova not used to recovering after NBA losses\n\nPOLL MISSES: Five teams that were snubbed or overrated in the preseason Top 25\n\nTOP 25: Kansas Jayhawks start preseason poll at No. 1 followed Kentucky, Duke\n\nF Reid Travis, Kentucky. John Calipari\u2019s recruiting classes normally draw the headlines, and this year\u2019s stellar cast of freshmen is no different. But the most important player on a national title contender is this Stanford graduate transfer who averaged 19.5 points and 8.7 rebounds a game last season. Travis not only gives the Wildcats another weapon at 6-8, but he also brings a veteran flavor to mesh well with a talented group that will have to gel together leading up to March Madness.\n\nG/F Nassir Little, North Carolina. The 6-7 freshman forward won\u2019t be a knockdown shooter right away, but he\u2019ll ignite this UNC squad from the get-go with his overall abilities, namely a jump-out-of-the-gym athleticism. He was the MVP of the McDonald\u2019s All-American game, and should have no shortage of highlight-reel tomahawk dunks in 2018-19.\n\nF Rui Hachimura, Gonzaga. Perhaps no returning NCAA player from last season has more potential, as the 6-8 Japanese product showed flashes of brilliance on last year\u2019s \u2018Zags roster. His performance in the NCAA tournament\u2019s second round \u2014 25 points, five rebounds and four blocks in a Sweet 16-clinching win over Ohio State \u2014 was a snapshot of how he can spark the Bulldogs this season. 2017-18 was somewhat of an adjustment season for Hachimura before he really started to blossom.

After cruising through four August exhibition games in the Bahamas against professional teams, Calipari\u2019s new Kentucky squad is poised to be among his most-hyped yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not intoxicated by this,\u201d Calipari said after the Bahamas trip. \u201cAt the end of the day we should be a monster defensive team, we should be a great rebounding team, we should be a team that can fly up and down the court and put pressure on you both sides of the ball. And we should be a team that shares, because we\u2019ve got a lot of guys that are skilled enough to play that way. And it seems to me we\u2019ve got some dogs. \u2026 I like to have a couple dogs on our team that will not back away.\u201d\n\nWhen sophomore forward PJ Washington elected to pull his name out of the NBA draft in May, Kentucky\u2019s roster already featured three former five-star point guards, a projected lottery pick on the wing, three former five-star post players and the blend of returning experience and freshman talent that has characterized Calipari\u2019s best Kentucky teams.\n\nYOUTH SERVED: Historic recruiting class aiming to carry Duke to another title\n\nROCK CHALK: No. 1 Kansas enters thinking national title or 'failure'\n\nREBUILDING: Defending champ Villanova not used to recovering after NBA losses\n\nThose facts didn\u2019t stop Calipari from adding to his riches with five-star point guard Ashton Hagans, who moved from the 2019 class to the 2018 class to enroll this summer, and Stanford graduate transfer Reid Travis, a two-time first-team all-Pac 12 player and former McDonald\u2019s All-American.\n\nFive-star freshman forward EJ Montgomery, the top-ranked recruit in the signing class according to the 247Sports Composite, didn\u2019t play in the last three Bahamas games because of a back injury, but Kentucky cruised in each, including 100-64 over Mega Bemax, a Serbian professional team featuring two NBA draft prospects that beat Michigan 12 days later.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we felt like we didn\u2019t really play to our potential,\u201d Washington said. \u201cWe feel like we can play a lot better than we did. We\u2019ve just got to improve on the defensive end, which is going to lead to better offense. We\u2019ve just got a lot more work to do, and we know that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that veteran leadership from Washington, Travis and sophomores Quade Green and Nick Richards that could be the biggest boost to Kentucky\u2019s chances to match its preseason accolades instead of falling into the traps freshman-heavy rosters ranked in the top three preseason did in four of the last five seasons.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to get caught up in the hype,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to set that tone early in the locker room. \u2026 Got to come in here and work and be a team. If you\u2019re not part of the team, we\u2019re going to call you out. That\u2019s what everybody is doing so far, so we have nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\nCalipari\u2019s efforts to pump the brakes on the excitement surrounding his team have largely fallen on deaf ears in Lexington since the Bahamas trip.\n\nMost preseason rankings have slotted Kentucky at No. 1 or No. 2, and a likely top-five season-opening matchup against Duke will bring immediate national focus to the team.\n\nExpectations for individual players have soared as well, especially freshman guard Tyler Herro, the lone 2018 signee not named to the McDonald\u2019s All-America game who led the team in scoring in the Bahamas and has drawn comparisons to everyone from Devin Booker to Rex Chapman to Larry Bird.\n\nEven Calipari has a difficult time holding back his glee when talking about the work ethic of Herro and the rest of his freshmen as evidenced by the frequent late-night players-only workout sessions in the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cI really like this team,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cThey like each other. \u2026 When everybody is putting in the time and working and are comfortable in their own skin they can be about each other. \u2018I\u2019m happy with me, so I\u2019ll be happy with you and I\u2019m happy with your success because it doesn\u2019t infringe on my thing.\u2019 But if you\u2019re not that way, if you try to trick somebody, normally you\u2019re the guy that tries to bring people down. We don\u2019t have any of that on this team.\u201d\n\nUpon returning from NBA workouts, Washington quickly noticed a difference in the latest batch of five-star freshmen.\n\nThroughout last season, Calipari bemoaned the reluctance of some of his players to follow the lead of his former player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who put in extra individual work in the gym and weight room away from practice.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re a lot more hungry than some of the guys we had last year,\u201d Washington said. \u201cThey\u2019re in the gym a lot more, they\u2019re really curious, they ask a lot of questions and they\u2019re just trying to be the best version of themselves, which is what you need to be a better team.\u201d\n\nCalipari reports his returning players have responded to the tone set by the freshmen while maintaining the leadership roles their experience dictates.\n\nThat combination was key in 2011-12 when freshman Michael Kidd-Gilchrist dragged his older teammates to early-morning workouts and veterans such as Terrence Jones, Doron Lamb and Darius Miller played key roles in the run to a national title.\n\nThe 2012 national title team and the 2014-15 squad that won its first 38 games before falling to Wisconsin in the Final Four will be the standards the current Kentucky team is judged by. The 38-1 team also jump-started its season with a preseason exhibition tour of the Bahamas.\n\nNow this team will have to prove its preseason hype can match those squads\u2019 in-season success.\n\n\u201cWe learned a lot (in the Bahamas),\u201d Calipari said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone on our team who was afraid.\u201d", "CLOSE French film icon Catherine Deneuve has joined 99 other women to denounce a backlash against men following the Harvey Weinstein scandal.

The Associated Press said Sen. Dean Heller conceded to Democrat Jacky Rosen.\n\nAlthough the party that controls the White House has typically lost Senate seats in midterm elections, Democrats had the disadvantage of defending most of the seats on the ballot, including 10 in states carried by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate losses for Democrats came even as their party captured the House.\n\nIt was the first time since the nation started directly electing senators in 1914 that a party has won control of the House without gaining seats in the Senate. The gains are significant because a larger Republican plurality will make it easier for Trump to have cabinet and judicial nominees approved.\n\n\"Democrats threw everything they had at our Senate majority, and we held the line,\" said Steven Law, who oversees political groups aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, which spent more than $123 million helping GOP candidates.\n\nWhile Democrats celebrated their House victory, the Senate gains were a victory for Trump, who had devoted much of his energy in the final stretch of the campaign to helping Republican Senate candidates.\n\nTrump sounded jubilant. He tweeted a quote he attributed to Ben Stein saying \u201c there\u2019s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election. Mr. Trump has magic about him. This guy has magic coming out of his ears. He is an astonishing vote getter & campaigner.\"\n\nIndiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, who had sold himself as an independent thinker in a state easily won by Trump, lost to GOP challenger Mike Braun.\n\nRepublican Rep. Kevin Cramer beat incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, while in Missouri Republican Josh Hawley defeated incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, the Associated Press projected.\n\nMcCaskill, a moderate, had sought to persuade voters she was \u201cnot one of those crazy Democrats,\u201d as she sought re-election in an increasingly conservative state that Trump carried by 19 percentage points in 2016.\n\nHeitkamp had tried to focus on local issues and her moderate record but was hurt by the nationalization of the race through the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIn Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott had a slim lead over Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a race that may be headed for an automatic recount.\n\n\"We are proceeding to a recount,\" Nelson said Wednesday morning. His spokesman had said Tuesday night that the results were not what the campaign had worked hard for, leading some Florida papers to report that Nelson had conceded..\n\nScott, a two-term governor and former healthcare CEO spent more than $50 million of his own fortune to win and Trump had campaigned intensively for him.\n\nDemocrats would have needed to hold onto seats with endangered Democrats such as Nelson and also score upset wins in order to flip control of the Senate where Republicans have a 51-49 majority.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz survived a challenge from Democrat Beto O'Rourke, according to AP projections.\n\nIn Tennessee, Republican Marsha Blackburn captured the seat of retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., in what Democrats hoped would be a pickup for their party.\n\nThe special election in Mississippi won't be decided until Nov. 27 in a runoff between Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican appointed to the seat in April, and Democrat Mike Espy. The runoff is required because none of the candidates won an outright majority Tuesday.\n\nDonnelly, one of five Democrats who struggled to survive in states Trump easily carried, was the first incumbent of any party to fall. He lost to Braun after Trump visited Indiana three times in the final two weeks to generate support for the Republican candidate.\n\n\"What we need to take to Washington is what works in the real world,\" Braun told supporters at his victory rally. The businessman and former state House member had cast himself as a political outsider in the mold of Trump.\n\nTrump had dubbed Donnelly \"Sleepin' Joe.\"\n\nRepublican National Committee spokesman Michael Joyce bragged Tuesday that the party has a new nickname for Donnelly that \"we think will really stick this time: former Senator Donnelly.\"\n\nBesides Donnelly, Heitkamp and McCaskill, the other Democrats running in top Trump states were Jon Tester of Montana, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who survived his challenge.\n\nMore: Elections 2018 complete race results\n\nThe last time they were on the ballot, the nation wasn't as divided along partisan lines and voters were more willing to split their tickets.\n\n\"People are voting in a more parliamentary way,\" said Charlie Cook, head of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nThe Democratic incumbents focused on nonpartisan local issues \u2013 such as helping veterans \u2013 while heavily emphasizing health care, an issue with a lot of crossover appeal, particularly for female voters. They promised to be with Trump when they agreed with him and stand up to him when they didn't.\n\nBut those red-state Democrats had the difficult task of keeping their base enthused about their re-election bids while attracting enough of the Republicans they needed to carry their states.\n\nTrump's final campaign stops did not include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania or Michigan \u2013 states he narrowly carried but where the Democratic incumbents had easier re-election campaigns than expected.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, called them \u201csnap-back\u201d states. Trump\u2019s small 2016 margin means there are many voters \"who have a party ID not aligned with the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the first opportunity, they reassert their old selves,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats hoped to offset any losses with pickups in Tennessee and Arizona, states where the Republican incumbent chose not to seek re-election after being publicly critical of Trump.\n\nIn Nevada, Republican incumbent Heller both embraced Trump and tried to create some distance.\n\nHeller said 80 percent of what the president\u2019s done has been \u201cvery, very good\u201d while the rest has been a \u201creality TV show.\u201d\n\nThe Senate does not always move in the same direction as the House in an election. In 1970, for example, Republicans gave up 10 seats in the House while gaining one in the Senate.\n\nBut a party has never lost complete control of the House while increasing power in the Senate, according to Eric Ostermeier, author of the Smart Politics blog run by the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"This is unusual because the odds are so heavily stacked in favor of the party that is actually the less popular party,\" Sabato said. \"The Democrats pretty much were behind the eight ball in the Senate from the beginning.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/election-day-2018-republicans-senate/1848366002/", "CLOSE At the British Academy Britannia Awards in Los Angeles, Excellence in Comedy honoree Jim Carrey says the Republican Congress is enabling \u201csome very dark times in our country.\" (Oct. 27) AP\n\nJim Carrey (Photo: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\nA picture might be worth a thousand words, but pointed political artwork by Jim Carrey is worth a small war of the words on Twitter.\n\nThe \"Kidding\" actor, who has poked several political figures with his paintings, including President Trump and Sen.

(Photo: Martini & Rossi)\n\n\"Aperitivo is not a drink, it's a state of mind,\" says Roberta Mariani, global brand ambassador for Martini & Rossi, the world\u2019s best-selling vermouth. That's one of the key messages she preaches, particularly to American drinkers, many of whom are only now beginning to embrace a more laid-back approach to imbibing, with lower-alcohol beverages that can be leisurely sipped throughout an afternoon.\n\nIt's a simple lesson, though perhaps one that's best understood with a visit to the aperitivo motherland, the Casa Martini visitors center and museum near Turin, Italy. Over 150 years of Martini & Rossi's storied history is on display, stretching back to its beginnings in 1863 as Martini, Sola & Co. The company became known as Martini & Rossi in 1879, and by the end of the 19th century, its products could already be found in 70 countries.\n\nThe expansion never stopped, and according to 2017 IWSR data, Martini & Rossi accounts for well over half of all the vermouth sold globally. Despite the ever-increasing worldwide presence though, Martini is still firmly tied to its local origins. \"The link between Martini and the local agriculture is like this,\" says Alessandro Garneri, an agronomist and operations manager with parent company Bacardi, clasping his hands together for effect while leading a walk through key botanical fields in Pancalieri.\n\n\"We tried in the past to have the same cultivation in different places,\" Garneri says. It didn't work in quite the same way, though. Martini continues to get nearly two-thirds of its botanicals locally from the Piedmont region, and in particular, around Pancalieri. The area showcases an elevation of several hundred meters while sandwiched between mountains and a river, with cold winters followed by warm, humid summers. All of those factors work together to provide a particular micro-climate which in turn gives a distinctive character and quality to the botanicals grown there. \"So we don't have a choice!\" exclaims Garneri.\n\nThat tie to local agriculture remains essential, even in the development of new products. That's the case with the introduction of Riserva Speciale, a premium line designed for an elevated cocktail or aperitivo experience. When Martini was in search of unique floral botanicals for Riserva Speciale Ambrato, the company turned to its farming partners for answers. After much research and experimentation, the result was Roman Chamomile. \"We were looking for a floral note that's not too common, to add something to complete the bouquet,\" Garneri says.\n\nThe botanicals were then carefully matched with quality wine also from the local region. \"We have added some special wines to our Riserva Speciale range, as we want them to be an expression of the territory \u2014 Moscato D'Asti for Ambrato and Nebbiolo for the Rubino,\" Mariani says.\n\nA century and a half later, and an aperitivo with Martini & Rossi still transports you straight to the Piedmont countryside where it all began, and to the piazzas of Turin where it's still enjoyed en masse.\n\nCasa Martini is open to the public with a variety of ticket and tour options. The visitors center is approximately 45 minutes outside of Turin, in Pessione, Italy.

USA TODAY\n\nAn artist\u2019s impression shows the first interstellar asteroid: `Oumuamua. This unique object was discovered on Oct. 19, 2017, by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope in Hawaii. Subsequent observations from ESO\u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile and other observatories around the world show that it was travelling through space for millions of years before its chance encounter with our star system. (Photo: ESO/M. Kornmesser)\n\nIt's been dubbed a comet, an asteroid, and a new class of interstellar object. Now, a paper from Harvard astronomers suggests one more possibility into the mysterious object nicknamed \"Oumuamua\": Alien probe.\n\nResearchers focused on whether solar radiation pressure could explain the unusual acceleration of \"Oumuamua,\" the first object entering the Earth's solar system from interstellar space.\n\nThe paper said if solar radiation pressure is the reason \"Oumuamua\" is moving at high speeds, it represents \"a new class of thin interstellar material\" either made naturally or through artificial means.\n\nThe paper's authors, which include Avi Loeb, chair of Harvard's astronomy department, suggest the object could be a \"lightsail\" used to propel spacecraft with solar energy.\n\nThe other possibility? It comes from aliens. \"A more exotic scenario is that 'Oumuamua'\n\nmay be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization,\" reads the paper.\n\nThe paper was posted on Cornell's University arXiv e-print archive, where research is submitted before it is formally published.

The name \"Oumuamua\" is Hawaiian for \"scout\" or \"messenger.\"\n\nThe object puzzled astronomers because of its long shape and unusual acceleration. According to NASA, \"Oumuamua\" is up to a quarter-mile long and has reached speeds of 196,000 miles per hour.\n\nIn June, a study led by astronomer Marco Micheli of the European Space Agency found the object was a comet, noting \"Oumuamua\" was not slowing down as much as expected because of gravitational forces.\n\nMore: Dawn spacecraft exploring asteroid belt runs out of gas, ending mission, says NASA\n\nMore: Remember Starman and the Tesla Roadster launched into space?

Boghosian)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 While President Donald Trump publicly touted Republican midterm wins in the Senate, the White House began bracing Wednesday for a Democratic-controlled House that could tie up his agenda and unleash a series of investigationsinto his administration, decisions and personal finances.\n\nThough Democrats did not catch the \u201cblue wave\u201d some predicted, the party picked up dozens of competitive House contests and claimed control of a chamber that will serve as a check on the president \u2013 while also giving him several high-profile adversaries to campaign against.\n\nTrump, who remained mostly out of sight Tuesday after a whirlwind tour ahead of the election, was eager to focus on Republican successes in the Senate, where battleground wins in Indiana, Tennessee and Missouri appeared to validate the president\u2019s schedule of campaign rallies in those states.\n\n\u201cTremendous success tonight,\u201d Trump posted on Twitter late Tuesday. \u201cThank you to all!\u201d\n\nBut as Trump hunkered down to watch returns at the White House with family and friends, he saw Democrats pick up seat after seat in the House, many in swing suburban districts that will likely be crucial to his own reelection effort in 2020.\n\nWith each flipped seat, his plans to reduce taxes further and pursue stricter immigration controls faded.\n\nMore: Elections 2018 US House race results\n\n\u201cThere will be gridlock,\u201d predicted Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide. \"There will be more than two dozen investigations conducted by at least four House committees.\u201d\n\nDemocratic control of the House also kept open the prospect of an impeachment, a move Democratic leaders have downplayed but that some on the left have declined to rule out. Many Republicans believe impeachment proceedings would represent an overreach and would help the GOP in 2020.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to reclaim the speaker's gavel in the House, struck a bipartisan tone in remarks late Tuesday.\n\n\"Tomorrow will be a new day in America,\" Pelosi told supporters in Washington.\n\nThe White House said Trump called Pelosi along with other congressional leaders and candidates.\n\nMore: U.S. House: Democrats move closer to control of Congress\n\nMore: Republicans make history by keeping Senate while losing House\n\nAlthough the White House has raised the idea of working with Democrats \u2013 particularly on infrastructure \u2013 Trump's legislative agenda will likely be mostly thwarted by the shift. Analysts said the partisan divisions that have plagued Washington will be difficult to overcome now.\n\nDuring the campaign, Democratic leaders signaled they would investigate Trump's relationship with Russia during the 2016 election, subpoena the tax returns he has refused to disclose and probe any number of administration actions, from alleged conflicts of interest to claims of profiteering in office.\n\nHouse Democrats would press for more information about the interactions between Trump's real estate empire and his decisions in office, including whether members of the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida are influencing executive decisions. They are also sure to seek additional documents related to Cabinet controversies, including the multiple probes of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\n\nThere is pent-up desire among many Democratic lawmakers to confront Trump. Control of the House gives them new subpoena power, along with the ability to kill his legislative proposals.\n\n\"Gridlock and investigations,\" predicted Republican strategist Liz Mair.\n\nAdministration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they have been considering strategies to deal with a Democratic majority, including the possibility of pushing back hard on expected investigations by targeting lawmakers including Reps. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who are likely to be leading them.\n\nNadler and Schiff, vocal Trump critics, would be in line to chair the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, respectively.\n\nAides say the White House is also considering other strategies.\n\nTrump can leverage Republican control of the Senate to continue to remake the federal bench by assigning judges who are likely to win confirmation. Like President Barack Obama, Trump could also rely more heavily on the use of executive orders to pursue policies on immigration and other contentious issues.\n\n\u201cWill he try to make deals with Democrats on things like infrastructure or even immigration or guns, given that Trump\u2019s base might allow Trump to cut deals they wouldn\u2019t for any other GOP president?\u201d asked Doug Heye, a longtime GOP consultant. \u201cOr, do we see an ever-escalating rhetoric and political tactics that only drive the country further apart?\u201d\n\nSeveral Republicans said Trump could gain some political advantage from having a powerful adversary in Democratic House leaders.\n\n\u201cPresidents sure love running against Congress and being able to distance themselves from unpopular lawmakers,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. \u201cThe best guarantee for [Trump] getting re-elected is an impeachment effort in the House.\u201d\n\nBruce Haynes, a former Republican campaign strategist, said a Democratic majority would not paralyze Trump. After all, the president has already had to deal with a slim GOP majority in the Senate that made it difficult to reach the 60-vote threshold required for most controversial legislation.\n\n\u201cIt means he has the one thing that gives him energy and power: An opponent,\u201d Haynes said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders predicted that \"the president's agenda isn't going to change.\u201d Instead, she encouraged Democratic leaders towork with the White House on tax cuts, immigration, the opioid epidemic and infrastructure.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, Trump returned to immigration as a major theme, using the caravan of thousands of Central Americans winding its way through Mexico to renew calls for a border wall. Democrats have widely rejected the wall, and have said Trump was using the caravan to drum up support from GOP voters.\n\nIf the president hopes to secure federal funding for the barrier, he will likely have to pursue it during the coming lame duck session of Congress, before Democrats take control of the House in January.\n\nAs he campaigned in recent weeks, Trump increasingly downplayed Republican chances of keeping control in the House. Much of his frenetic schedule focused not on the House but instead on vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbents in states the president carried in 2016.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway said the administration will deal with House investigations as they come up. In the meantime, she said, Trump will seek to work with Congress on issues like immigration and infrastructure.\n\nVoters don\u2019t want resistance or obstruction, she said.\n\nAsked what would happen if, for example, the House Democrats sought Trump\u2019s tax returns, Conway said the administration would talk to its lawyers.\n\nShe then echoed a favorite line of the president\u2019s when the future isuncertain: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/midterm-elections-2018-donald-trump-stakes-congress/1843578002/", "bad url", "Even though the Indianapolis Colts didn\u2019t play during Week 9, they moved further away from first place in the division after a pair of AFC South teams claimed victories.\n\nNeither the Colts or the Jaguars played in Week 9 due to their bye weeks and being at the bottom of the division only became more difficult as the top two teams got wins.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the AFC South standings entering Week 10:\n\nHouston Texans (6-3)\n\nThe Texans are surging, and they are looking like a well-oiled machine.

The company will, however, have its first 5G mobile device ready for purchase around March 2019, Sol\u00e9 told USA TODAY.\n\nSprint previously announced it was working with LG on its first 5G phone for the first half of 2019.\n\n\"We hope to be the first ones to have a true, mobile 5G handset (available in) March of next year,\" says Sol\u00e9, noting that unlike AT&T it will not be calling its LTE Advanced network and devices \"5G.\"\n\n\"Until then, we're going to call the things what they are.\"\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/11/06/sprint-ups-mobile-hotspot-limits-50-gb-launches-faster-4-g-network/1898490002/", "", "Tennessee Titans cornerback Kevin Byard wasn\u2019t the first NFL player to disrespect the Dallas Cowboys star logo at his opponent\u2019s home field.\n\nObviously, there was Terrell Owens in 2000 running over to midfield at Texas Stadium and doing that now-infamous pose on the star, which led to Emmitt Smith\u2019s reaction to re-take it before Owens did it again and was knocked off of it by Cowboys safety George Teague.\n\nLet\u2019s look back at the history of the move:\n\n1.

Our NFL insiders break down the biggest storylines from the weekend of action. USA TODAY\n\nTexans wide receiver Demaryius Thomas before the game against the Broncos on Sunday.\n\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. \u2013 Apparently, even a thank you banner draped from the outside of the stadium and pregame scoreboard tribute was not enough to ease some of the resentment Demaryius Thomas feels towards Denver Broncos general manager John Elway, head coach Vance Joseph and the team's coaching staff.\n\n\"It just hurts me, man, I'm emotional,\" Thomas said during an explosive, if rambling radio interview Monday on 760 AM in Denver. \"I\u2019m empty still.\"\n\nThomas \u2013 who was traded last week from Denver, where he spent the first eight-plus years of his career, to the Houston Texans \u2013 spoke glowingly of his relationships with the Broncos\u2019 support staff, specifically the public relations, operational and equipment departments, kitchen staff, mailroom clerks and groundskeepers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear he does not feel the same way, however, about the team\u2019s football leadership.\n\n\"It was so tough,\" Thomas said of the split from the only NFL team he had known. \"Even leading up to the Kansas City game (October 28) it was tough, because that one day, I didn't say anything to anybody. I walk into the job and Vance Joseph walks up to me and says, 'Don't listen to the trade talks, it's not true.'\n\n\"Before the season started, the trade talk was still going, and nobody said anything to me. Why come to me Monday when it's the same talk? When he said that to me, I said, 'How is it not true? My agent (Todd France) called me today and said Elway wanted a fifth-round pick for me.'\n\n\"So, we're telling stories to each other now? I thought we were going to be men about this.\"\n\nMORE NFL:\n\nThomas also told the radio hosts \u2013 Marc Stout and former Broncos players Ray Crockett and Rod Smith \u2013 that he had heard from others that Elway and Joseph were critical of his role within the Bronco\u2019s offense.\n\n\"You know what bothers me \u2013 I don't want to stir any pot \u2013 but it bothers me \u2026 I had people from Denver saying like, 'They really said they got rid of you because you were the problem on offense and they said they wanted to better the offense,'\" Thomas said. \"I'm like, 'Really, bro?' People just kept stirring it on.\n\n\"I heard they were saying that Vance was saying something, and Elway was saying something. I did so much for this organization and never had nothing bad to say about anybody \u2013 none of the players I played with. I just did my job and kept it as professional as I could. For you all to say that I was one of the reasons that the offense wasn't going, and say this and that, man, that hurt.\"\n\nJoseph was asked Monday about comments Thomas made that were less than flattering about the Broncos after Denver lost to his new team, the Texans, 19-17 on Sunday.\n\n\"I think it's just a player who won a game, who was excited to win the game,\" Joseph said. \"That's not my focus or concern right now, as far as who's saying what, and the high school conversations of after-the-game facts. We can't be concerned about that. \"\n\nIn Thomas\u2019 day-after radio interview, it was clear he was also bothered he was not voted a team captain this year for the first time in several seasons.\n\n\"It did affect me a lot, because before we even chose captains, I went upstairs, and I had a conversation with Mr. Elway,\" Thomas said. \"(Former head coach and current personnel consultant Gary) Kubiak reached out to me one day and Elway was just telling me how he wanted me to be a leader in another way, because usually I'm on guys because I know guys are better than what they are and what they put on film.\n\n\"When I had the meeting, I was like, 'OK, I'm going to be a captain again.' I go to the meeting room and it's like every player came to me and was like, 'How are you not a captain? We picked you.' ... To not be a captain, it was just heartbreaking.\"\n\nKUSA is a TEGNA station.", "None\n\nThe German city of Frankfurt blurs by the window of a Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 as it lands in the city following a 13-hour flight from Singapore in October 2018.

(Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr., a human-resources expert, is tackling your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.\n\nThose who know me understand that I can act as a provocateur in conversations. I question. I disagree. I offer a counter-point.\n\nWhile I sometimes play the contrarian, it\u2019s always done with respect because I value these rich conversations. I learn from them, and I believe my colleagues and friends do too.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t value are one-sided tirades, hate-filled speech and attacks on others simply because they share different points of view.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am encouraging HR to support civility in the workplace every day \u2013 and particularly Wednesday, when the results of the midterm elections might be met with gloating, anger, frustration or worse, no matter what side wins.\n\nMore: Ask HR: What should I do if there's no HR? Should employers offer paid time off to vote?\n\nWe saw during the last presidential election that politics created divisions in the workplace, making for some uncomfortable and even sparking violent incidents. Incivility hurts work relationships, morale, employee retention and business productivity.\n\nWhile I had hoped we learned from that experience, HR leaders have come to understand it wasn\u2019t just the presidential election that caused rifts to erupt.\n\nEven today, workers continue to be affected personally and daily by the current political climate. From the employee who is so unsettled about the day\u2019s political news that she gets upset at work to the employee who refuses to work with a colleague because he is a member of another political party, the workplace is being negatively impacted and, often, others stand by unsure of what to do.\n\nWorkplace incivility is unacceptable.\n\nMore: Ask HR: I may want to start my career over. When is someone too old for an internship?\n\nWhen employers ask what can be done to create a civil workplace in this political climate, I tell them that it\u2019s important to be proactive. Leaders must make inclusion and respect for diversity of thought a central element of their organizational values, and they also must set expectations for workplace behavior and model the behavior they want to see. This is not the time for \u201cDo as I say, not as I do.\u201d\n\nOn days like Wednesday, workplace leaders must be vigilant about reinforcing their values and expectations. They should monitor discussions and interactions for politically charged exchanges to ensure they do not lead to bullying or threatening behaviors between employees or become a significant burden on business operations.\n\nIf an interaction between workers becomes overly assertive or even aggressive, leaders must take action to stop it. Incivility, which can lead to violence, must be met with zero tolerance.\n\nBut a workplace cannot be a sterile environment where creativity, healthy civil discourse and engaging conversations can\u2019t occur. In fact, employers should not have policies that prohibit all political discussions.\n\nInstead, we need to treat political divisions the same as we do any diversity issue \u2013 by building workplace cultures where interactions can take place in a climate of tolerance, acceptance and civility.\n\nMore: Ask HR: Some insights on the #MeToo movement and harassment in the workplace\n\nPart of this is helping employees understand that co-workers can \u2013 and do \u2013 have other viewpoints that are just as valid as their own. As my mother says, you can disagree without being disagreeable.\n\nAs we look to come together, let\u2019s aspire to make the workplace a safe place for civil discourse. In this, HR and the workplace can inspire and influence broader society.\n\nWednesday is a day to emphasize the common purpose we find in our work, whether that\u2019s pride in a product, relationships with clients or service to a community.\n\nWhether your candidate wins or loses, I know that the workplace \u2013 with a focus on commonly shared goals, values and beliefs that benefit everyone \u2013 can support healthy discussions about politics.\n\nHave a question?

USA TODAY\n\nVoters head to the polls to cast their votes in the midterm election on Tuesday. (Photo: Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Voters flocked to the polls Tuesday in what could be the highest turnout in decades for a midterm election to decide the control of Congress and governors of 36 states.\n\nPresident Donald Trump isn\u2019t on the ballot. But he barnstormed 20 states since September, arguing that \u201ceverything we have achieved is at stake,\u201d as he said at a rally Monday in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nWith 435 members of Congress on the ballot, Democrats were hoping the election results would allow them to wrest control of the House and Senate from Republicans. Former President Barack Obama stumped in Miami saying the \u201ccharacter of our country is on the ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere appears to be enthusiasm on both sides of the aisle,\u201d said Lara Brown, director of George Washington University\u2019s graduate school of political management. \u201cThe idea that two-thirds of Americans would in fact turn out to cast a vote one way or another for or against the president is relatively extraordinary.\u201d\n\nAbout 40 million early votes were likely cast, said Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who tracks the figures. In the last such congressional elections in 2014, there were 27.5 million early votes.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted said more than 884,000 Ohioans had cast absentee ballots by mail this election and almost 430,000 had cast an absentee ballot early in person. The statewide mail-in total is 23 percent higher than the 2014 midterms and the in-person total is nearly three times the 146,000 ballots cast in 2014.\n\nBrevard County, Florida, set a modern-day record for a midterm election with 63.06 percent turnout by 5:10 p.m. The previous record was 62.7 percent in 2002.\n\n\"Early turnout appears to be pretty strong,\" said Bradford Queen, a spokesman for the Kentucky Secretary of State's office.\n\nHigher turnout exacerbated problems such as long lines and voting-machine malfunctions at states including Georgia, Arizona, Florida, New York, Michigan and Texas.\n\n\u201cTurnout is exceptionally high so they might not have been prepared,\u201d said Laura Stoker, a political science professor at University of California, Berkeley, who studies voting and elections.\n\nBy 5 p.m. EST, a national hotline for problems at the polls already had fielded more than 24,000 calls and 1,759 text messages about problems such as sites not opening on time, machines not working and long lines.\n\n\u201cIt is a reflection of the great interest in this election cycle and also sadly a reflection of the problems and barriers that most voters have faced this election season,\u2019\u2019 said Kristen Clarke, president of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which led the coalition of more than 100 civil- and voting-rights groups.\n\nFor this election, 41 states use equipment that is at least a decade old, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. In 33 of those states, election officials say they must replace their machines by 2020, but in most cases don\u2019t have the money to do so. The risk is that older machines break down and are more susceptible to malicious software.\n\nCongress approved $380 million this year for states to improve their election security. But longer term, states will need to update their voting technology and auditing, according to John Fortier, director of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\n\u201cThere are still some major long-term challenges that we will need to address in the next several years to improve that security more,\u201d Fortier said.\n\nAn array of federal agencies monitored the election as it unfolded, including the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, intelligence officials and the FBI. By 9 p.m. EST, Homeland Security officials said there was nothing significant to report and that there were no widespread cyberattacks.\n\nHere were some key spots for reported voting problems:\n\nGeorgia\n\nCommon Cause, a member of the Election Protection coalition said it had received reports of \"voting machines going down in large numbers across the state.\"\n\nA group of Georgia voters filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Atlanta to stop Secretary of State Brian Kemp from presiding over the election because of concerns about his fairness.

Everything was at a standstill while around 100 people waited for the machine to get fixed.\n\n\"It stinks, it really does,\" Nagy said. \"So many people were upset.\"\n\nAt Greenfield Elementary in Oakland County's Southfield Township, resident Sarah Donovan was told her voting machine was out when she arrived to vote at about 8:30 a.m. Many of the 20 to 30 others waited, but she went home to call the township.\n\nThe machine's batteries ran out after two hours, said the Southfield city clerk Sharon Tischler. It was plugged into a surge protector, but the protector was set to the \"off\" switch, which was fixed by a custodian.\n\nOther machines in Wayne County \"froze\" this morning and have since been restored, said spokesperson for the clerk's office Lisa Williams-Jackson.

From now on, we\u2019ll take a look at it every week until the playoffs begin.\n\nAFC\n\n1. Kansas City Chiefs (8-1)\n\nKC rolled over yet another hapless conference opponent, wrecking the Browns, 37-21. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for three more touchdowns, bringing his NFL-leading total to a whopping 29. Despite losing to the Patriots at Gillette Stadium three weeks ago, the Chiefs still look like the class of the AFC.\n\n2. New England Patriots (7-2)\n\nWith tight end Rob Gronkowski and running back Sony Michel out with injuries, New England still managed to put up 31 points in a Sunday night win over the Packers. Naturally, receiver/return man Cordarrelle Patterson filled in at RB, logging 11 carries for 61 yards. The Josh Gordon-bolstered Patriots offense could be even better when it\u2019s closer to full strength.\n\n3. Pittsburgh Steelers (5-2-1)\n\nThe Steelers\u2019 early season struggles seem to be behind them. Sunday\u2019s 23-16 victory over the rival Ravens was their fourth straight victory. In the absence of Le\u2019Veon Bell, running back James Conner (24 carries, 107 yards; 7 catches, 56 yards, TD) has been a revelation for Pittsburgh, which faces the streaking Panthers on Thursday night.\n\n4. Houston Texans (6-3)\n\nAfter dropping their first three games of the season, the Texans have now won six straight. On Sunday, quarterback Deshaun Watson completed 17 of 24 passes for 213 yards and two TDs to lead Houston over Denver, 19-17. The Texans have another tough matchup after their bye week; they\u2019re on the road at Washington (5-3) on November 18.\n\n5. San Diego Chargers (6-2)\n\nWinners of five straight games, including Sunday\u2019s 25-17 triumph over Seattle, the Chargers are rolling. They\u2019re also now in a soft portion of their schedule. L.A.\u2019s next three opponents\u2014the Raiders, Broncos, and Cardinals\u2014are a combined 6-19. The Bolts\u2019 Dec. 2 matchup against Pittsburgh could help determine playoff seeding.\n\n6. Cincinnati Bengals (5-3)\n\nThe Bengals, who squeaked past Tampa 37-34 on Sunday, are clinging to the AFC\u2019s final playoff spot. Things are about to get pretty tough. This week, Cincinnati hosts the red-hot Saints. Making matters worse is that star receiver A.J. Green will reportedly miss at least several games with a toe injury.\n\nNFC\n\n1. Los Angeles Rams (8-1)\n\nThe Rams suffered their first setback of the season on Sunday, falling to the Saints, 45-35, at the Superdome. Still, before succumbing L.A. managed to fight back to tie the game after falling behind, 35-17. On the road, that\u2019s quite a feat. Moral victories don\u2019t exist in the NFL, though, and Sean McVay\u2019s crew\u2014which got shredded by Drew Brees, Michael Thomas, and company\u2014sounded humbled after the loss.\n\n2. New Orleans Saints (7-1)\n\nBy now, the Saints\u2019 ugly season-opening loss to the Buccaneers feels like it was about 10 years ago. New Orleans has won seven straight games and just handed the high-powered Rams their first loss of the season. It\u2019s early, obviously, but with home-field advantage throughout in the playoffs, this team would be downright scary.\n\n3. Chicago Bears (5-3)\n\nThe young Bears have been hot and cold this season, but now they seem to be on an upward trajectory. On Sunday, Chicago notched its second straight win, crushing the Bills 41-9. They have a long way to go, but the Bears could be on track to win their first NFC North title since 2010.\n\n4. Washington Redskins (5-3)\n\nJust when we thought Washington, which came into Sunday\u2019s matchup against the Falcons on a three-game winning streak, was past laying an egg, the Redskins did just that, falling to Atlanta 38-14. Luckily for Washington, the NFC East isn\u2019t very good this year, even though Philadelphia (4-4) is nipping at their heels.\n\n5. Carolina Panthers (6-2)\n\nThe Cam Newton-led Panthers, who ripped the Buccaneers 42-28 on Sunday, may be in a Wild Card spot now, but they\u2019re only a game back of New Orleans. The NFC South race appears to be a good one; Carolina plays the Saints twice over the season\u2019s final three weeks.\n\n6. Minnesota Vikings (5-3-1)\n\nDon\u2019t look now, but Minnesota has now won four of its last five games. Without injured receiver Stefon Diggs and a relatively quiet day from wideout Adam Thielen (4 catches, 22 yards, TD), the Vikings still managed to take care of the Lions, 24-9.", "", "The core idea of democratic socialism is that we, working people, deserve better.

Farmers are committing suicide, and so are taxi drivers in New York City. That's why in the battle for the soul of our country, we must win.\n\nMost of us are sinking, and there's no bottom. This is the ugly face of capitalism. That's why so many people have joined the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nWhy do so many of us live in pain because of bad teeth or bad backs, unable to afford medical care because an insurance or drug company rations it to make a buck? It doesn't have to be this way, but a small elite benefits from the status quo. They keep all the rest of us fighting and killing over scraps with talk of racial superiority or bathroom scares, or fear of poor and working people in other countries.\n\nWe deserve better. We have a right to the wealth our labor creates. We demand democracy. And we demand freedom from struggling and toiling to barely survive, while a small group of the super wealthy live like modern-day kings.\n\nWe should hold politicians accountable to us\n\nWe joined the DSA to fight back, because these oligarchs depend on us, and therein lies our power.\n\nWe are the ones who through our labor make this country go. What would happen if we all stood together across our differences to demand better wages and working conditions, our own unions? Or better yet, cooperative ownership of our own workplaces?\n\nWe must make politicians serve our interests, instead of those of their wealthy owners. Republicans give massive tax breaks to the very rich. Republicans cut health care and attack Social Security. Even the Wall Street wing of the Democrats supports luxury development instead of affordable housing. That's because we're not holding them accountable.\n\nBernie Sanders: Trump lies about 'Medicare for All' and he's made health care worse\n\nCounterpoint: My family escaped socialism, now my fellow Democrats think we should move the party in its direction\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nBut if we take back the power, there is no limit to what we can do. And it's already starting to happen.\n\nAmericans are listening to nurses and learning that the United States is the only developed nation in the world without universal health care. People are waking up to the lies insurance and drug lobbyists are feeding us. Even more than half of people who identify as Republicans now support Medicare for all.\n\nThat's why President Donald Trump is suddenly panicked about democratic socialism.\n\nDSA chapters in all 50 states are building a movement, canvassing neighbors and organizing co-workers to take action at the ballot box and the picket line.\n\nWe\u2019re not a political party, but we support candidates from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zak Ringelstein running in New York and Maine for federal office, to Jade Bahr and Jovanka Beckles running for state office in Montana and California, and Franklin Bynum and Cliff Willmeng running for local office in Texas and Colorado.\n\nAnd unlike most organizations, we\u2019ll keep applying pressure long after Election Day.\n\nTo get equality, this is a fight we must win\n\nUltimately, we want a society based on equality, solidarity and freedom, not fear and hate. We\u2019ve seen that every-man-for-himself fails the working class, and we need collective, democratic solutions. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos don't create good jobs \u2014 they pay low wages so they can hoard the wealth their workers create.\n\nInstead, we could have publicly funded college for all, democratically controlled public utilities, universal secure retirement, mental health care, freedom from police violence, clean energy and related jobs, fair trade policies and an organized union voice at work, and eventually owning and running our own workplaces altogether. We can make all these investments by taxing the filthy rich, reining in Wall Street, and running our politics for people, not profits.\n\nNone of us can do it alone, but together we can do anything.

(Photo: David Wallace, The Arizona Republic)\n\nThe youngest general manager in the four major pro sports leagues has also been the NHL's busiest.\n\nIn 30 months on the job, 29-year-old John Chayka has made 21 trades \u2014 some major, some minor \u2014 each done with the idea of building the Arizona Coyotes into a sustainable winner.\n\nChayka doesn\u2019t claim success because he hasn\u2019t made the playoffs. But as the 7-6-0 Coyotes \u2013 who had a five-game winning streak snapped Monday night \u2013 sit today with the league\u2019s third-lowest goals-against average (2.23), it\u2019s clear Chayka is having an impact.\n\n\u201cHe is mature beyond his years,\u201d Coyotes president Ahron Cohen told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cHis thoughtfulness in how he evaluates and how he makes decisions is second to none.\u201d\n\nKyle Dubas has received attention as the young, vibrant first-year general manager of the Maple Leafs. But he's just over three and half years older than Chayka, who is in his third NHL season.\n\n\u201cI know I would not have been ready to be a general manager when I was 29,\u201d said Dallas Stars general manager Jim Nill, noting that he had a chance to be a GM in his 40s and didn\u2019t take it because he felt he had more to learn under Ken Holland, Scotty Bowman and Jim Devellano in Detroit.\n\nMore: Members of Ottawa Senators apologize after video of them ripping coach, team goes public\n\nMore: Claude Lemieux's son, Brendan, suspended two games for illegal hit to head\n\nNashville Predators GM David Poile, 68, had worked as an NHL team executive for 17 years and had been a league GM for almost seven years before Chayka was born.\n\nIn his short time in charge, Chayka has traded for goalies Antti Raanta and Darcy Kuemper; forwards Derek Stepan, Alex Galchenyuk, Richard Panik and Vinnie Hinostroza; and defensemen Niklas Hjalmarsson, Alex Goligoski, Jason Demers and Jordan Oesterle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of moves, and now they are accumulating to mean something,\u201d Chayka said.\n\nHe also drafted forward Clayton Keller and extended defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson on an eight-year, $66 million contract when many in the media were predicting Ekman-Larsson would leave as a free agent after this season.\n\n\"It was rewarding (that Ekman-Larsson stayed),\u201d Chayka said. \u201cHe could have signed with 30 other teams and gotten as much money, if not more. He had leverage. \u2026The fact he was willing to sign here long-term was a big vote of confidence for our ownership, myself, the coaching staff. It validated a lot of things we are trying to do.\u201d\n\nWhat the Coyotes are trying to do is ignite a fan base by qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2012.\n\nChayka\u2019s managerial boldness has started to pay off. The Coyotes were 17-9-3 after Feb. 6 last season. They were the tied for the fifth-best record in that stretch, owning a better mark than the Golden Knights, who played in the Stanley Cup Final.\n\n\u201cThere's a real buzz in town about our team,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe past couple of days my phone and email are blowing up from people saying they are proud of us or that they think we are doing a good job. People see the vision, see the progress.\u201d\n\nCohen said the Coyotes show increased ticket sales, corporate sponsorship, TV ratings, merchandise sales and food and beverage sales. Cohen calls it a \u201cmosaic of positivity.\u201d\n\nChayka\u2019s work is at the heart of the optimism. \u201cComing into the league at such a young age, the one way (Chayka) could establish himself was be aggressive,\u201d Stepan said.\n\nStepan, a center, is one year younger than Chayka and he appreciates how easy it is to communicate with him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it is an age thing \u2013 it\u2019s just the way (Chayka) is,\u201d Stepan said. \u201cHe\u2019s an open book. He wants to change the way GMs interact with players. ... He wants to be very honest with everyone. If you want to talk to him about something, you feel like you can.\u201d\n\nChayka prefers to laud coach Rick Tocchet for the work he has done in making this team more competitive.\n\n\u201cThe defense is the heartbeat of our team,\u201d Chayka said.\n\nArizona's goalies have a collective save percentage of .926, and they can thank a veteran defensive group for stabilizing the blue line.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our roster, we built from the back end,\u201d Stepan said. \u201cA lot of the older guys, the guys with the most games played, are on the back end. The system that Tocchet has put in allows us to have success on the defensive side of the puck.\u201d\n\nEven though Chayka deals with rival general managers who were in the game before he was born, he has never felt out of place. General managers Holland (Red Wings), Doug Wilson (Sharks) and Lou Lamoriello (Islanders), in particular, have been helpful sharing experiences.\n\n\u201cI am a lifelong learner,\u201d Chayka said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t giving away state secrets, but I ask questions and I enjoy hearing their perspectives.\u201d\n\nNill said Chayka deserves credit for being a quick learner. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart man, and open-minded,\u201d Nill said.\n\nChayka said he will never reach the point when he feels like he has mastered the job. He hasn\u2019t had a moment when he felt like he had figured out the process.\n\n\u201cIf we make the playoffs,\u201d Chayka said, \u201cMaybe that will be the time.\u201d", "LeBron James speaks at the opening ceremony for the I Promise School in Akron, Ohio, Monday, July 30, 2018.

Longtime friend Steven Koblik, a history professor at Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens \u2014 the Division III college where Popovich once coached \u2014 told The Washington Post in 2017 that Popovich \"could talk books or international affairs or the (Ronald) Reagan White House for hours.\"\n\nPopovich, a five-time champion coach, would have the ability to reach diverse crowds as a politician, as he's often been outspoken about gender and racial equality, LGBT rights and shown an ability to fight for the disenfranchised.\n\nSerena Williams\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam singles champ is considered by many to not only be the greatest women's tennis player of all-time but also one of the greatest female athletes ever.\n\nHer off-the-court endeavors speak volumes and her outspoken personality to stand up for what she believes in has garnered her millions of fans. In conjunction with her diverse charity work, Williams is also a fashion icon who embraces her identity as a new mom.\n\nWilliams, who grew up a Jehovah's Witness (which calls followers to remain politically neutral) and said in 2016 she does not vote because of her religion, visited the Obama White House and established a friendship with Michelle Obama. While Williams has not been very vocal about the Trump presidency, interestingly John McEnroe said Trump once wanted him to play Serena in a battle-of-the-sexes match for $1 million.\n\nTim Tebow\n\nThe former Heisman Trophy winner has been a popular figure since he played at Florida. He has stayed a prominent face during his short stint in the NFL and now his time as a minor leaguer for the New York Mets. Tebow also has remained a likable personality asa college football television analyst and best-selling author. His latest book, \"This Is the Day,\" shows how the 31-year-old is much more than a philanthropist and how he could inspire a base with his motivational attitude.\n\nTebow, a conservative who grew up the son of Baptist missionaries and starred in an anti-abortion Super Bowl commercial alongside his mother in 2010, was asked about the possibility of running for public office in 2016 by \"The New Yorker\": \u201cIt\u2019s something I could imagine. I want to do whatever I feel can have the greatest impact and touch the most people. If one day that is the political realm, then that\u2019s something I\u2019d consider. I wouldn\u2019t be doing it out of a passion for politics but out of a passion for people.\u201d\n\nPeyton Manning\n\nThe retired NFL quarterback and Super Bowl champion would be able to rally the people.\n\nWhile Manning has veered away from politics as much as possible \u2014 saying he's got \"zero interest in being a politician\" in September \u2014 he still has the popularity to win a campaign. Rep. Jimmy Duncan, R-Tenn. said in September that \"if Peyton Manning ran for any office in Tennessee, he could win by a landslide.\"\n\nManning's ESPYs hosting and commercials for Papa John's, Nationwide, and Sprint might be corny, but they also present him as the everyday American. In 2017, when asked about golfing with President Trump, Manning said it'd be \"un-American\" to decline it.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nThe retired NASCAR driver has a huge fanbase. He also isn't afraid to wade into divisive topics, quoting a 1962 speech by John F. Kennedy to address NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. Shortly after Trump lauded the NASCAR community for respecting the flag in 2017, Earnhardt tweeted: \"All Americans R granted rights 2 peaceful protests ... Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable-JFK.\"\n\nHe has publicly condemned the Confederate flag as \"offensive to an entire race\" and he tweeted after the Charlottesville violence that \"hatred, bigotry & racism should have no place in this great country. Spread love.\"\n\nP.K. Subban\n\nThe Nashville Predators defenseman is one of the few black players in the NHL, having grown up in Canada with family roots in Jamaica. His strong personality on the ice has carried over off it. Subban's never been afraid to speak his mind and engage in activism over social media to his 1.1 million Twitter followers or in public spaces.\n\nIn 2017, Subban told Nashville fans he'd never kneel during the national anthem when asked if he'd follow NFL players' lead. Instead of protesting, Subban has tried to bridge divides in other ways. He created the Blueline Buddies program, which connects children with cops in the Nashville community for every home game in 2017-18. He's given back to the community back home as well, having pledged $10 million to a local children's hospital in Montreal.\n\nSteve Kerr\n\nThe Golden State Warriors head coach and former Chicago Bulls player has used his platform to voice his displeasure with the current White House. Since the election in 2016, Kerr hasn't shied away from being critical of President Trump, comparing his public discourse and the response of his followers to \"The Jerry Springer Show.\"\n\nBefore his NBA career, Kerr's father, Malcolm, was shot to death by the Islamic Jihad in 1984 while serving as president of the American University of Beirut. Kerr has been a strong supporter of gun control and used his public platform to rant about gun laws following school shootings.\n\nKerr's easygoing personality helped him excel as a television commentator for Turner Sports, and Warriors assistant Bruce Fraser told The Guardian in June: \u201cSteve would, honestly, be an incredible president for our country. He would be better at that than as a coach and he\u2019s a great coach.\u201d\n\nMalcolm Jenkins\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles' safety has used the NFL as a vehicle for social change in a variety of ways, some of which included raising his fist \u2014 instead of kneeling \u2014 during the national anthem to protest against social injustice and police brutality. Jenkins said in September that he wanted to \"get this conversation to move away from the anthem. I think it's served its purpose.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old Pro Bowler created the \"Let's Listen Together\" initiative in which he discusses social issues with superintendent of police Michael Chitwood.\n\nJenkins has leadership experience, spearheading the Player's Coalition \u2014 a group of NFL players whose \"mission is to focus on key areas of criminal justice reform, social and racial equality where our support can make a meaningful difference.\"\n\nThe Super Bowl champion has also met on Capitol Hill with legislators, written an opinion-editorial in the Washington Post and signed a letter to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell explaining his perspective on the issues of players kneeling during the anthem.\n\nHe told CNN at the beginning of the year that he wouldn't attend Trump's White House to celebrate the Eagles' Super Bowl win.\n\nAly Raisman\n\nThe 24-year-old Olympic gold medalist called out USA Gymnastics for not doing enough to stop sexual abuse by former team doctor Larry Nassar. Raisman and other survivors were awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award.

He voiced concern in a USA TODAY Sports column about vice president Mike Pence being chosen to lead the U.S. delegation at the Pyeongchang Games, citing what he perceived to be Pence's support for anti-gay legislation and policies.\n\nAt a Boston political rally in October, Rippon said: \"I've always thought one day I would run for office.\"\n\nCurtis Granderson\n\nA political career would come with glowing endorsements from his peers.

Joe Crowley in Tuesday's primary election. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 More women will serve in Congress than ever before, with at least 118 set to fill seats after Tuesday's election.\n\nAs of midday on Wednesday, women had surpassed the current record of 107 voting members, according to race calls from the Associated Press analyzed by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. The new total includes 31 first-time House members, seven more than the record set for freshmen women during the 1992 \"Year of the Woman\" election.\n\nThe surge was driven largely by Democrats as the party took over House control. Democrats account for 84 of 96 women set to serve in the House so far, including 30 of the 31 newcomers, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\n\nWomen will represent two-thirds of the districts that Democrats flipped, building on momentum from the \"Resist\" movement that followed President Donald Trump's election in 2016.\n\nNext year\u2019s freshman class will include women of color who have broken barriers in their states, plus the youngest woman ever elected to Congress \u2013 Democratic activist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, who turned 29 in October.\n\nEleven women senators were elected, nearly all Democrats. Marsha Blackburn, a GOP U.S. representative, defeated Tennessee\u2019s former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen in her bid to become the state\u2019s first woman senator. U.S. Rep. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, ousted Republican Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada.\n\nBlackburn and Rosen will be joined by another freshman woman, although which one is not yet clear. Two U.S. representatives, Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, were locked in a tight Senate race in Arizona, where it may take days to count all ballots.\n\nNine women, meanwhile, have won governors' races.\n\nWomen were poised to make significant electoral gains in this \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d election. Their historic involvement follows the massive Women\u2019s March to resist Trump\u2019s presidency and the #MeToo movements\u2019 protest against sexual misconduct in the workplace.\n\nIn CNN exit polls, almost 80% of voters said it was very or somewhat important to see more women elected. That was a higher priority for women than for men, but not by much, CNN said.\n\nWomen smashed records this election cycle in terms of the number who filed to run, the number of women who became their party's nominees for House, Senate and gubernatorial races, and even the number of women running against women in general election races.\n\nFor the first time in history, Americans could elect more than 100 women to the House, said David Wasserman, the U.S. House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\n\u201cThat would not be occurring without Donald Trump in the White House,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cIt is a direct reaction to his election.\u201d\n\nThe majority of those women who ran for House seats \u2013 185 \u2013 were Democrats, while 52 were Republicans. About one-third were women of color.\n\nAmong the barrier-breaking races:\n\nMichelle Lujan Grisham, a U.S. representative from New Mexico, became the first Democratic Latina governor.\n\nSharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat and member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, and Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat and member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, were elected as the first Native American congresswomen. Results are still pending for Yvette Herrell, a GOP state representative in New Mexico and a member of the Cherokee Nation, who is running for Congress. Davids is also Kansas\u2019 first LGBTQ member of Congress.\n\nIlhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have become the first Muslim women in Congress. Omar, a Democratic Minnesota state representative, already the nation\u2019s first Somali-American legislator, is now the state\u2019s first woman of color elected to Congress. Tlaib, a former Michigan state legislator who is also a Democrat, had no Republican opponent in the 13th Congressional District, which includes parts of Detroit.\n\nGuam elected its first woman governor, as former lawmaker Lou Leon Guerrero, a Democrat, claimed the position for her party for the first time since 2003.\n\nBoston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat who ran unopposed, became the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about what is a representative democracy, making sure that the perspectives and experiences of the entire population are mirrored in those legislative institutions, whether it\u2019s at the state level or the federal level, is important,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP). \u201cThose experiences shape the policy priorities of those elected officials.\u201d\n\nCurrently, 84 women serve as voting House members, including 61 Democrats and 23 Republicans. That has been the record since 2013, according to the Rutgers center.\n\nTwenty-three women serve in the Senate, including six Republicans and 17 Democrats. Six women \u2013 two Democrats and four Republicans \u2013 are governors.\n\nDuring the 1992 \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d voters elected more new women \u2013 24 \u2013 to Congress than in any previous decade, and that record has remained, according to Rutgers.

Here's why. USA TODAY\n\nJodi Meyers stands in front of the house she purchased despite her $55,000 in student debt. (Photo: Jodi Meyers)\n\nGetting a college degree and buying a home are two milestones many Americans aspire to. But as student debt skyrockets, the burden can often make homeownership tougher to achieve.\n\nAlmost one in four homebuyers this year had student loans, which made it harder for them to save for a down payment and delayed their purchase, according to the 2018 Homebuyer Profile report from the National Association of Realtors given to USA TODAY exclusively. Among buyers rejected for a mortgage from a lender, 40 percent had college debt, the NAR found.\n\nStudent debt will likely continue to vex homebuyers as tuition climbs and more people go to college. That could ultimately crimp the housing market as these buyers put off purchases to deal with their loans first.\n\n\u201cStudent loan debt is not just a hurdle now, it will likely be one going forward,\u201d said Jessica Lautz, NAR\u2019s managing director of survey research and communication. \u201cIt\u2019s also an all-generation issue as we see parents taking on debt for their children or others going back to school.\u201d\n\nDown payment challenge\n\nOne of the first obstacles that indebted would-be buyers face is saving for a down payment, considered the hardest step by more than a quarter of buyers with loans, according to the NAR.\n\nTwo in five buyers, like Jodi Meyers, cut out luxury or nonessential items to save up for a home.\n\nJodi Meyers stands by the pool at the house she bought. (Photo: Jodi Meyers)\n\nRejected by the first mortgage lender she went to, Meyers, 44, consulted a second who said if she could cobble together $9,000, she could qualify for a loan. Meyers was paying off $55,000 in student loan debt after she went back to school during the recession to get a degree.\n\nFor three months last year, Meyers and her family \u2013 a husband and two adult children \u2013 squirreled away cash. She earmarked her tax refund for the purchase, deferred her $600-a-month student loan payment for two months and worked with her car lender to postpone a payment until after closing.\n\nThen it was down to spending only on the necessities. \u201cIt was not easy,\u201d she said. \u201cOur food was just the basics \u2013 tuna fish and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\u201d\n\nAt the end of it all was a $249,000, four-bedroom home in Lakeland, Florida, a 40-minute drive from where she and her family had rented, in the Disney-planned community of Celebration, where houses started at $400,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my dream home, but it got my foot in the door, and now I\u2019m building equity,\u201d she said of her new place. \u201cBut maybe one day we can sell and build our dream home in Celebration.\u201d\n\nMore Money: 401(k) account balances hit record high of $106,500; where do you stack up?\n\nMore Money: 7-Eleven to launch scan-and-go at 14 Dallas stores\n\nMore Money: GM, Honda are betting Cruise founder Kyle Vogt can lead the autonomous car pack\n\nCompromise needed\n\nLike Meyers, many homebuyers with student debt had to forget their ideal home and settle on whatever they could afford. Seventy-six percent of buyers with student debt compromised on their home purchase this year, according to the NAR data, versus 63 percent with no loans.\n\nJackie Kuykendall and her husband, Pepe Santana, both psychologists saddled with $440,000 in loans, could only prequalify for a mortgage if Santana, 44, dropped from the application and Kuykendall's mother co-signed the loan. Even after that, they were limited to condos and townhouses in a Denver suburb \u2013 instead of a house in the city limits \u2013 because prices were too high for their $330,000 budget.\n\n\u201cBecause of our price point and the Denver market\u2019s short supply, we didn\u2019t look for very long there,\u201d said Kuykendall, 39. \u201cThere were some weekends no property met our criteria.\u201d\n\nAs they encountered one bidding war after another, they looked for cheaper homes so they could compete with other offers. They landed a three-bedroom townhouse in Westminster, Colorado, after beating out 20 other buyers. They bid $290,000, or about $30,000 more than the listing price.\n\n\u201cWe really like being homeowners and having a place to plan for the future,\u201d Kuykendall said.\n\nBut she isn't done looking.\n\n\u201cEven though we adore this condo, we would like a house, so my daughter can have a yard.\u201d\n\nDebt-to-income a killer\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles facing buyers with student debt is a strict requirement from lenders offering government-backed mortgages: It's called debt-to-income, or DTI.\n\nThe DTI ratio shows what percentage of your monthly income goes to paying your debt payments. Simply divide your gross income by your total minimum payments on your debts, including your hypothetical mortgage payment, to calculate the ratio. The higher the percentage, the lower mortgage you qualify for.\n\nFor Cristina Colacci, an interior designer paying off $60,000 in education loans, her monthly payment killed her DTI. It started at $600 per month but was down to $200 per month by the time she applied for a mortgage. She and her husband, an architectural drafter, qualified for $100,000 less than a similar couple without student loans.\n\n\u201cBased on our income, we should have been able to afford $450,000, but because of my monthly payment, that dropped us to $340,000,\u201d said Colacci,, 40. \u201cThat makes a big difference in New Jersey. That\u2019s the bottom rung of houses.\u201d\n\nCristina Colacci became a real estate agent to help buy her house while juggling $60,000 in student loans. (Photo: Cristina Colacci)\n\nIt took Colacci and her husband three years to find a three-bedroom home that was move-in ready enough and still within their price range. That was after losing bidding wars on six other homes. Colacci even became a licensed real estate agent because she was so frustrated by their search.\n\n\u201cWe either needed to move away or find a way to make more income,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only reason I was able to afford this house is because, as an agent, I could waive my commission.\u201d\n\nCLOSE If you don\u2019t automatically think of a booming housing market when you think of Boise, Idaho, think again.

The defense played OK, considering the circumstance and the rash of injuries. The offense continued its downward trend, making mistakes and struggling to capitalize on opportunities.\n\nThis week, we\u2019ll look at an offensive play that exposes some of the head-scratching decisions Mike McCarthy and Aaron Rodgers are making. On defense, we\u2019ll see how the safety position fared with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix no longer on the roster.\n\nWith that, let\u2019s dive in.\n\nFour-yard fail\n\nThe story of the 2018 Packers thus far has been an utter failure at generating consistent offense.\n\nLook no further than early in the second quarter with the Packers down 7-3 to the Patriots but with the ability to take the lead if they can take the drive down and score.\n\nIn a third-and-4 situation, the Packers are in a good position schematically. They can attack on the ground or through the air. McCarthy decides to roll out 11 personnel (one running back, one tight end). The Packers line up initially in a three by two formation. Rodgers motions Aaron Jones back into the pocket, so the Packers get a three by one set at the snap.\n\nAt the snap \u2013 and only needing four yards, mind you \u2013 Jimmy Graham (top of the screen), Equanimeous St. Brown and Marquez Valdes-Scantling (bottom of the screen) all climb vertically at the snap. Davante Adams, lined up in the slot flexed away from the tight end, is the only receiver in the entire group who runs a shallow route.\n\nThe Patriots only rush four, but they disguise it well and right guard Byron Bell gets beat inside and Rodgers has to move off the left side of the field.\n\nRodgers also had Jimmy Graham one-on-one here. He locks in on Davante Adams as his first progression, but by the time Adams gets any space, Rodgers has to evacuate the pocket.\n\nThis is just one of many reasons demonstrating just how out of sync this Packers\u2019 offense is. Contrast this design and failed execution with the Patriots\u2019 offensive attack. Tom Brady gets the ball out of hands in a hurry. While there is no doubt that he\u2019s a great player, he, Josh McDaniels and Bill Belichick rarely ask him to do more than he has to.\n\nThe Packers could take a cue from the Patriots. It\u2019s an untenable situation to rely upon low-percentage throws to convert third downs.\n\nAaron Rodgers hasn\u2019t been good. He\u2019s also not being put into the best situations. The only problem, though, is that Rodgers has so much latitude at the line of scrimmage it\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s Rodgers or McCarthy making the call.\n\nAddition by subtraction\n\nYes, Tramon Williams missed a big tackle against Josh Gordon that resulted in a 55-yard touchdown. We must acknowledge the bad with the good because for a good portion of this game, there was a good amount of, well, good.\n\nThe Packers had one of the more impressive drives of the season stopping the Patriots inside the 10 yard-line in two separate sets of downs after a Bashaud Breeland penalty renewed the downs at the 1-yard line.\n\nIn that sequence, Williams, all 190 pounds of him, made one heck of a tackle and physical play to negate a touchdown.\n\nAt the snap, Brady hands the ball to James White off the left tackle. White cuts outside and has a good path to paydirt.\n\nKyler Fackrell actually does an OK job pushing the tackle backwards and widening White\u2019s angle. Antonio Morrison gets cut off by a New England blocker, but Williams knifes through, unimpeded, and takes White off his line and tackles him for a gain of one.\n\nThe worry with putting Williams at safety was whether or not he\u2019d hold up in a more physically-demanding position. With one week\u2019s worth of evidence in, it appears Williams is up to the challenge.\n\nAt worst, Williams\u2019 performance Sunday was on par with a typical Ha Ha Clinton-Dix outing. In actuality, Williams moves with more urgency and reads the field better. He doesn\u2019t have the size, but Clinton-Dix only sparsely initiated contact.\n\nWilliams will have to eliminate the mistakes, like the missed tackle, but he should keep the back end of this defense respectable through the balance of the 2018 season.", "Election Day carries a crucial opportunity to elect a Congress that will stand up for what is a co-equal branch of government with the presidency: Our view\n\nA protest in 2013 in Doral, Florida. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nFor most of its history, Congress has been an important check on presidential power.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s fellow Democrats, for instance, killed his plan to expand the Supreme Court to pack it with his own yes men. And a band of Republicans made clear to President Richard Nixon that he would be impeached for his Watergate transgressions if he did not resign.\n\nThe current GOP-controlled House and Senate, however, have been little but obedient lap dogs to President Donald Trump. This would be troubling under any circumstances. But it is especially so now with a president who careens from gross incompetence to troubling executive overreach; who tolerates, even encourages, corrupt behavior; and who tries to govern through a toxic mix of self-adulation, divisive rhetoric, fearmongering, outright lies and juvenile name-calling.\n\nIt is not healthy for the country, or the institution, when Congress abets Trump\u2019s politicized attacks on his own Justice Department and on the free press. Nor is it healthy when Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans remain mostly silent when he incites hate groups with incendiary language, or when he veers erratically from threatening nuclear war with North Korea to declaring himself \u201cin love\u201d with dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nNow comes the first general election of the Trump era, which carries with it a crucial opportunity to restore the basic oversight functions of Congress.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: To deliver even more results, vote Republican\n\nThe institution needs men and women of good faith who will stand against presidential overreach. It needs lawmakers who will unite, not divide; who do not regard compromise as a dirty word; and who will stand up for what is a co-equal branch of government with the presidency.\n\nThe stakes in this year\u2019s elections, which Trump himself describes as a referendum on his presidency, could not be higher. Yet typically, only about 40 percent of the eligible population participates in midterm elections, compared with an estimated 60 percent during presidential years. That number dropped to just 36.7 percent in in 2014, setting a record low for midterms going back to World War II.\n\nThose who don\u2019t vote shouldn\u2019t complain about the outcome.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results will determine the degree to which Trump\u2019s baser instincts will be reined in and the degree to which the rule of law will once again be an important principle in our nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIn the weeks and months ahead, special counsel Robert Mueller is likely to provide more clarity on a number of issues, among them Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, Trump\u2019s longstanding business ties with Russia, and whether his firing of James Comey, the FBI director who was overseeing the Russia inquiry, constituted obstruction of justice.\n\nThe next Congress \u2014 indeed, this one \u2014 needs to make clear that it will not tolerate efforts to end or limit Mueller\u2019s inquiry, either through some kind of chain-reaction firing at the Justice Department or by Trump\u2019s ongoing drumbeat of public criticisms.\n\nThe current House and Senate have failed miserably at their duty to conduct oversight hearings and to put guardrails around a reckless president whose own aides have questioned his fitness.

USA TODAY\n\nMacBook Air (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nThink a major update to the MacBook Air was long overdue?\n\nThe last time Apple bestowed this much attention on the notebook the company claims as its \u201cmost loved Mac,\u201d Barack Obama was in his first term in the White House.\n\nSure, we\u2019ve seen some specs bumps along the way, and my own lightweight MacBook Air \u2013 circa mid-2013 \u2013 has been a reliable workhorse. But the No. 1 feature fans of the Air have had on our wish lists for years is the kind of beautiful high-resolution Retina display that Apple previously reserved for the most expensive computers in its mobile lineup, notably the priciest MacBook Pros, but also the most recent MacBook.\n\nSo you best believe the arrival \u2013 at last! \u2013 of Retina on the new MacBook Air I\u2019ve been testing gives the faithful an excellent reason to cheer, along with other features that modernize the machine.\n\nMore: First look: iPad Pro \u2013 Finally a proper PC replacement?\n\nAs with most of Apple\u2019s computers, you won't get an Air without spending serious bucks. It starts at $1,199 for a model with 8GB of RAM and a modest 128GB of storage, but the sum can climb to $2,599 if you jack up the specs to 16GB and 1.5-terabytes, respectively. (Apple still sells an older non-Retina MacBook Air for $999.)\n\nPrice aside, I found at least two other reasons to tone down the enthusiasm. I was disappointed in the battery life, and at one point while streaming a movie, the computer's fan kicked into overdrive.\n\nLet me digress for a brief detour back in time: The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs famously knocked the socks off Macworld conference attendees a decade ago when he pulled the very first MacBook Air out an interoffice envelope, a display of showmanship that demonstrated just how skinny and lightweight the computer was.\n\nIt wasn't the fastest computer back then and had limited connectivity but the remarkable (for its time) machine nevertheless boasted a full-sized keyboard, and it forever altered our vision for what a road warrior laptop could be and would become, forcing competitors on the Windows side to play catch up (which many of them eventually did).\n\nOf late though, MacBook Airs were getting tired, leaving some to wonder if Apple was ready to send the computer out to pasture \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be the first time Apple retired a product that was still popular (see the iPod nano, for one).\n\nFortunately, retirement was the last thing Apple apparently had in mind, and on balance the new MacBook Air represents a tantalizing alternative for those of you who might have otherwise considered a MacBook Pro with a 13-inch Retina display, which starts at $1,299. Indeed, the Air versus Pro conundrum yields a fuzzy choice. Pick the more robust Pro if extra performance is crucial \u2013 that is, you\u2019re the kind of person who cuts 4K videos or engages in other creative-oriented industrial strength computing tasks.\n\nFor the rest of you, pick the Air and don't look back.\n\nThe new MacBook Air. (Photo: Apple)\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the new MacBook Air:\n\nModernizing the Air\n\nApple has maintained the wedge-shaped design that has defined the Air since Jobs slipped it out of that envelope at Macworld. But at 2.75-pounds, the Air is about a \u00bc of a pound lighter than its most immediate predecessor and noticeably smaller. The far narrower bezels bordering its lovely 13.3-inch display, compared to what came before, help account for a computer that has 17 percent less volume.\n\nMy sturdy rose-colored test machine is as pleasing to look at as the screen, though you can also get it in silver or space gray. The color Apple is really touting though is green since the laptop is crafted from 100 percent recycled aluminum.\n\nThe display is not the only way Apple has modernized the Air. Embedded in the power button is Touch ID, meaning you can now unlock the Mac, or authenticate online purchases made via Apple Pay, with your fingerprint. It was fast and flawless in my tests.\n\nIt's funny that Touch ID is new to this Mac even as Apple ditched the feature on the latest iPhones. Of course, I would have liked to have seen Apple add Face ID facial recognition to this new Mac as well, but that was not to be. A feature called Windows Hello permits you to unlock many Windows 10 computers with your mug.\n\nTouch ID is tied to the T2 security chip that assumes a major role on the new Air. The T2 also permits you to bark out \u201cHey Siri\u201d to summon Apple\u2019s vocal virtual assistant.\n\nIt helps encrypted data stored on the computer on the fly. And the chip is also supposed to prevent an intruder from being able to mess with your Mac when you boot up.\n\nPorts and connectors\n\nA pair of state-of-the-art Thunderbolt (USB-C) connectors are on the new Mac, which you can employ for a variety of purposes: to rapidly transfer data, connect to external storage devices, connect to external displays (even 5K), and of course power up the computer through the adapter that comes in the box.\n\nIt also means you might share that charger with a USB-C capable smartphone, standard on many Android devices, but not Apple's own iPhones. You can also use a cellphone charger to give some juice in turn to the Mac, but such a lower wattage charger would take an awfully long time to do that.\n\nAlso worth pointing out: Apple improved the sound on the MacBook Air with speakers that deliver wider stereo separation, evident to my ears on jazz classics such as \u201cSo What\u201d by Miles Davis and \u201cTake Five\u201d by Dave Brubeck. And bravo, the computer has a standard-sized headphone jack, which Apple has sadly removed on recent iPhones.\n\nWhat's no longer here, though, is a slot for an SD memory card, a fixture on my older Air, though I frankly don't use it often.\n\nAssessing the keyboard\n\nI\u2019ve been writing this column on the backlit MacBook Air keyboard, which is now the third generation of what\u2019s known as a butterfly mechanism. Apple claims it provides four times the stability of the \u201cscissor\u201d mechanism used in other keyboards. I won\u2019t geek out on keyboard technologies but what I can say is I liked typing on this one. The keys have what feels to me like the proper amount of \u201ctravel.\u201d Of course, depending on what you\u2019re currently typing on, it may take a bit of getting used to.\n\nSome users in the relatively recent past have complained about the butterfly keyboards on some MacBooks and MacBook Pro models, even leading to class action suits against the company.\n\nApple eventually acknowledged that a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of keyboards on these models could have letters or characters that repeat unexpectedly, do not appear at all or feel sticky. The company says it has fixed such issues by now, and I certainly didn\u2019t experience any of these defects in the short time I\u2019ve had with the new Air.\n\nOne feature I certainly appreciate is the more spacious \u201cForce Touch\u201d trackpad on the computer. Force Touch technology detects how much pressure you\u2019re applying against the trackpad, leading to different outcomes on the Mac depending on how hard you press.\n\nNew MacBook Air. (Photo: Apple)\n\nRunning down the battery\n\nApple claims up to 13 hours of iTunes movie playback, based on a test where the company set the brightness to around 75 percent. I only got around 4 hours of battery life, running an admittedly far harsher test: I cranked up the brightness to the max, and streamed a high-definition, full-screen movie on Netflix via Wi-Fi.\n\nBut I was also somewhat disappointed when I used the Air in a more typical fashion. With the brightness roughly at 50 percent, I started using a fully charged Air on and off around at 10 a.m.. The laptop pooped out a little past 7 p.m.. In between, I had used the computer to begin writing this column, play some music and surf the web.\n\nApple insists stronger battery life is the norm, so I'm willing to conduct further tests to see how it all plays out. While this issue is \u2013 how should I put it? \u2013 still up in the air, however, I'll pause and wait to see if this is the computer to replace my aging MacBook Air.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter.

(Photo: Butch Dill/AP)\n\nThe final days of the 1980 presidential campaign were framed around a simple question: \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d The answer was a resounding \u201cno.\u201d President Donald Trump could ask a similar question today, and the answer would be a deafening \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nThe American economy is booming after only two years under our administration. This happened because of the president\u2019s leadership and support from Republicans in Congress. Tuesday, we\u2019re counting on the American people to re-elect Republicans to deliver even more results.\n\nSince Election Day 2016, businesses have created nearly 4.5 million jobs, including nearly 450,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe unemployment rate hasn\u2019t been lower in 49 years, and we\u2019ve reached record lows for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. Wages and benefits are rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade, and middle-class incomes have never been higher.\n\nAfter a 10-year lapse, America is the world\u2019s most competitive economy once again. This recovery is the result of sound policy and strong Republican leadership in the White House and Congress.\n\nOUR VIEW: Elect a Congress that will do its constitutional duty\n\nTogether, we\u2019ve rolled back red tape at a record pace, we\u2019ve unleashed American energy, and we\u2019ve forged new trade deals that are free, fair and reciprocal and put American jobs and farmers first, including a new deal among the United States, Mexico and Canada. We\u2019ve been enforcing our laws and securing our borders, and we\u2019ve already started to build the wall on our southern border.\n\nMore: Is Trump's border wall being built? Here are the facts\n\nAnd Congress and the president enacted historic tax cuts giving an average family of four $2,000 of their hard-earned money back every year.\n\nWhile Republicans have delivered results, Democrats have chosen a one-word agenda: Resist.\n\nThat party wants to roll back the progress we\u2019ve made over the past two years. As the Democrats proved the last time they ran Congress, their agenda meant fewer jobs, lower wages, slower growth and less opportunity for hardworking Americans.\n\nBut now the Democrats\u2019 policies are even more liberal \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 than ever before. They want massive tax hikes, weaker borders and a complete government takeover of health care that would hurt our families and seniors.\n\nThe country can\u2019t afford for Democrats to seize control of Washington. This boom began at the ballot box in November 2016, but our progress could end at the ballot box in November 2018.\n\nAfter two years of accomplishment, the choice in this election is between results or resistance. President Trump and I urge the American people to re-elect Republican majorities to Congress to deliver more results. Imagine where we\u2019ll be two years from now.\n\nMike Pence is vice president of the United States.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/06/mike-pence-deliver-even-more-results-vote-republican-editorials-debates/1898178002/", "Sarah Sanders told reporters that President Trump was elected by a majority in 2016 \u2014 a perfect example of how the Electoral College distorts reality.\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nLast week at the White House, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders unwittingly reminded Americans of just how badly the Electoral College distorts how we think about the popular support our president has. Sanders told reporters that the president \u201cgot elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted.\u201d\n\nExcept, that\u2019s not right. The president was actually elected by a minority of 63 million Americans, or 46.1 percent of the vote. That total, though, was filtered through the unfortunate winner-take-all system that 48 states use to allocate Electoral College votes, and it became enough to win despite the 66 million votes, or 48.2 percent, that Hillary Clinton received.\n\nPerhaps Sanders meant to say the president won a majority of votes in the Electoral College, which is true \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that an \u201coverwhelming majority of 63 millions Americans\u201d voted for him.\n\nHistorically, Trump's victory wasn't remarkable\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable is how common it is to overstate the president\u2019s electoral support. Books have been written to catalog the \u201cTrump phenomenon\u201d and declared that Donald Trump \u201cconquered America.\u201d Scientific American has tried to explain Trump\u2019s appeal through psychological analysis of the citizenry. And, of course, some online have even started speculating about who the next Donald Trump might be \u2014 that is, what CEO, billionaire, or celebrity could make a run that could match Trump\u2019s supposedly remarkable electoral support.\n\nExcept, let\u2019s wait a second before we dub President Trump an electoral \u201cphenomenon.\u201d In 2012, Mitt Romney was considered a failure \u2014 not a phenomenon \u2014 but he got a meaningfully greater percentage of the vote (47.2 percent) than Trump did in 2016 (46.1 percent). Other notable losers like John Kerry in 2004 (48.3 percent) and Al Gore in 2000 (48.4 percent) were supported by a substantially larger percentage of voters than Trump was.\n\nIn fact, on a percentage basis, Trump barely ekes out a victory over supposed blowout loser Michael Dukakis, who lost in 1988 by more than 300 electoral votes to George H.W. Bush. But if you take a look at the numbers, Dukakis\u2019 percent of the vote in that blowout loss (45.6 percent) was only half a percentage point less than Trump\u2019s (46.1 percent) in his supposed \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d victory.\n\nMore: Dear concerned Semi-Trumpers, please resist a little and vote for Democrats in midterms\n\nVote or forever hold your peace. This really IS the most important election of your life.\n\nYoung voters could have more political clout \u2014 if only more of them would just drag themselves to the polls\n\nWinning in the Electoral College, of course, makes all the difference in our perception of these candidates. I wouldn\u2019t expect any historian to go back and seriously study the \u201cDukakis phenomenon.\u201d Nor would I hold your breath for a detailed analysis of the psychological impact that Kerry had on voters \u2014 except perhaps as an example of what went wrong in 2004. Yet the way Trump governs and the way some in the news media portray him, you might think he garnered multiples of the electoral support of these losing candidates. Actually, the opposite is true.\n\nGive credit where it\u2019s due: Trump won according to the rules of the game that were in place in 2016, and that\u2019s beyond dispute. The popular vote is only the input to the one election that really matters, which occurs in the Electoral College. But that doesn\u2019t mean we ought to blind ourselves to the distortions that the Electoral College causes.\n\nThe Electoral College is a distorted view of voters\n\nFor instance, Trump has repeatedly claimed he won in a \u201clandslide\u201d in the Electoral College, where he won 56.5 percent of the vote, and this gives the impression that he enjoys widespread electoral support. But that\u2019s an illusion.\n\nThe final tally in the Electoral College distorts what actually goes on at the polls, because Trump won a few key states narrowly and lost overwhelmingly elsewhere. The percent he won in the Electoral College is thus not a true window on our democracy but is instead more like a fun house mirror: Sure, it partly reflects back what goes in, but the output is a distorted version of reality, not reality itself.\n\nThere is real danger in ignoring, as the Trump administration has, the distortions of the Electoral College. You start to think maybe some votes really should count more than others. You start to justify your disconnect with the popular will by telling yourself that you have more support than you actually do. And then \u2014 like Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2014 you might even start thinking that, wait a minute, maybe we did win a majority of votes. And then you say that out loud at the podium for all the world to hear.\n\nAt the carnival, once the illusion gets too real, you exit the fun house and the illusion fades. Unfortunately, it won\u2019t be so easy for us to rid our system of the gross and unfair distortions caused by the Electoral College. Until we do, though, we ought to at least acknowledge that we are living in the fun house world of the Electoral College and not the real world where the president won majority support.\n\nSadly, too many people recently seem to be stuck in the fun house, unable to find the exit.\n\nJason Harrow is chief counsel of EqualCitizens.US.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) ORG XMIT: MP103 (Photo: Jim Mone, AP)\n\nPolitical elections and financial tumult have been intertwined ever since 2016, when the unexpected Brexit vote and President Trump's win caught investors off guard, sending shock waves through markets.\n\nIn Tuesday's midterm elections, however, most Wall Street analysts aren't expecting market upheaval. The reason: Even if the vote results in a power shift in Congress and a return to divided government, it's unlikely to bring any near-term policy changes that will undo Trump's economic agenda or the passage of laws that will spook investors.\n\nWall Street is already gearing up for the possibility that the Democrats will take back the House while the Republicans keep power in the Senate. This base case, investors say, would result in legislative gridlock, but not upset the status quo.\n\nIn short, a split Congress would put the brakes on legislative activity in the coming year.\n\n\"People look at a divided Congress as not necessarily a bad thing,\" says JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, a discount brokerage based in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nStill, the market reaction could be more violent under two scenarios: if the Democrats can engineer an election sweep and grab power back in both chambers of Congress, or the Trump-led GOP retains control of both the House and Senate.\n\n\"Surprise outcomes can obviously move markets, but they are not anticipated outcomes,\" says Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investments in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nStocks strong after midterms\n\nWall Street will gain a degree of certainty regardless of the vote outcome, and that clarity has historically been bullish for stocks. Not only has the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index been higher one year after every midterm election since 1946, the fourth quarter of the midterm election year and the first two quarters of the following year have historically been the most bullish nine months in the four-year presidential cycle, according to data from LPL Financial.\n\nA split Congress won't mean the undoing of the president's big moves so far, such as a massive tax cut passed in late 2017, analysts say. Nor will it affect Trump's rollback of business regulations, as those were decided by executive action rather than new laws passed by Congress. There's also a chance, although there's no guarantee, that both parties will team up to get an infrastructure bill passed. A split Congress, however, will doom Trump's hopes for additional tax cuts.\n\nHistory says a scenario of Trump in the White House and a split Congress will be a bullish combination. Stocks have performed best with a Democratic president and a Republican-controlled Congress (posting average gains of 18.3 percent from 1950 through 2017), followed closely by a 15.7 percent gain with a Republican president and a split Congress, LPL Financial data show.\n\nMore Money: Trade wars, taxes, immigration among top economic issues for voters in midterm elections\n\nMore Money: 401(k) millionaires at Fidelity jump 41 percent in third quarter to record 187,400\n\nMore Money: Amazon drops $25 minimum for free shipping through holiday shopping season\n\nWildcards\n\nThe most negative outcome for markets would be if the Democrats regain total control of Congress. Under that scenario, Trump's agenda would face an aggressive pushback, his plan for additional tax cuts would be blocked, and he would likely face Congressional investigations into things like Russian interference in the 2016 elections and his tax cuts that Democrats say favor big corporations and the rich.\n\nThe specter of a move to impeach the president will also increase.\n\n\"While (a Democratic sweep is) unlikely, the uncertainty would likely hit stock markets hard,\" Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said in an e-mail.\n\nIn the event the Democrats take back Congress, pharmaceutical stocks could come under pressure if the party renews its push for lower prices for prescription drugs, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley, a Wall Street bank. Shares of banks could also feel pain if the Democrats attempt to reverse the wave of deregulation of financial companies under Trump.\n\nBudget negotiations with Trump are also likely to intensify as Democrats look to push back on spiraling deficits due to unfunded tax cuts. On the plus side, investors may welcome a Democratic \"pushback on protectionism,\" which could help de-escalate the president's trade fight with China.\n\nStill, a wholesale unraveling of Trump's tax cuts or other parts of his agenda of the past two years are unlikely, as it \"would likely face the veto pen of the president,\" Michael Feroli, an economist at J.P. Morgan said in a report.\n\nIf the GOP keeps their power in the Senate and House, for example, it would validate Trump's economic policies and likely give stocks a lift, although there's a possible downside if the president uses his broad mandate to push China even harder on trade, causing a full-blown trade war, warns Hatheway of GAM Investments.\n\n\"Trump might feel emboldened to do things that would prove risky for investors,\" says Hatheway. \"That would be unambiguously bad for the stock market.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/06/midterm-election-impact-markets-and-401-k/1892337002/", "", "", "", "bad url", "File-This March 30, 2018, file photo shows Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma talking to the media during a news conference at the women's NCAA Final Four college basketball tournament in Dallas.

Muffet McGraw and Geno Auriemma aren't thrilled about that, either.\n\nA sport that used to start official practice around Oct. 15 and have its first games at Thanksgiving is now beginning nearly three weeks sooner. Add that to the summer and preseason workouts that are allowed, and it's nearly a year-round sport.\n\nTuesday will feature almost 100 women's games and 150 for the men.\n\n\"I think the season is way too long,\" said McGraw, the coach for defending women's national champion Notre Dame. \"Basketball has more practice before its first game than any other sport.\"\n\nWith the Final Four taking place on April 5 and the title game on April 7, the season is nearly 200 days long.\n\n\"I don't like it. I don't like anything about it,\" said Auriemma, who has won 11 national titles as the women's coach at UConn. \"I don't care what kind of players you have. I remember the days when you couldn't talk to your players about basketball until Oct. 15. We had some pretty good teams back then.\"\n\nThis year the NCAA moved up the start date a few days to Tuesday to try and create more buzz for the beginning of the season. It gets the opening night of games away from college and pro football, which dominates weekends in the fall.\n\n\"Saturday and Sunday is football in this country. It's college football on Saturday and the NFL on Sunday,\" NCAA vice president of men's basketball Dan Gavitt said. \"You start the season Friday and basically they are dark for two days until you start up again on Monday. Starting on Tuesday, we can hopefully get a few days before you get to the weekend where people talk about the season.\"\n\nThe only flaw in that this year is the new start date falls on Election Day, which will dominate news cycles. Gavitt said the NCAA might look at that in the future.\n\nThe midweek start date does help alleviate a few scheduling conflicts for gyms, because volleyball is still going on and many schools use the same building for both sports.\n\nWith the new opening date, practice could officially start the last week of September \u2014 the NCAA allowed women's teams to begin 42 days before their first game. The men have had that in place since 2013. Teams are still only permitted to have 30 practices during that stretch, just as it's been since 2010. Until this season, schools were allowed 40 days to get those practices in.\n\nWomen's basketball coaches weren't in favor of adding the extra two days.\n\n\"Our WBCA board voted against 42 going forward. We were all opposed,\" McGraw said. \"The NCAA passed it anyway. The men are doing it and we have to have equality. We weren't in favor of moving the season up, either.\"\n\nThe NCAA also gave coaches more time with their players once school started. Teams are now allowed to use four hours a week for on-court basketball activities in the preseason \u2014 double what it previously had been.\n\nEach school is different in how it uses those days. A young team with many new players or a new coach could benefit from the earlier start date. A team expecting to go deep into the NCAA Tournament might wait a little longer to start so as to avoid burnout when the games matter most.\n\nMost coaches give their teams weekends off during September and October knowing that during the season they won't be able to do that.\n\nMcGraw started late with her top-ranked team knowing the ultimate goal was to play until early April. The Irish began on Oct. 4 and McGraw gave her players five days off for fall break.\n\nAuriemma had his team start even later, with its first practice coming in the second week of October.\n\nHe also took it a step further. Auriemma decided after last season that Huskies coaches wouldn't schedule offseason workouts during the spring and summer anymore. It was up to the players. If they wanted to work out, they'd have to reach out to the coaches.\n\nAuriemma thought that would bring back the joy of playing and the anticipation of practice. He figured it also would help develop the upperclassmen into leaders, making them organize the workouts and take more ownership.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Bill Feig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMichael Thomas reached behind a goal post to pull out a flip phone in homage to a memorable touchdown celebration of the past. Benjamin Watson used his touchdown catch to let everyone know that he and his wife are expecting \u2014 and it's going to be twins.\n\nThat was cause enough for celebration itself on a feel-good weekend for the NFL. So, too, was that bettors in Las Vegas and elsewhere finally turned the tables and took the bookies for millions of dollars.\n\nThey could have just as easily been popping champagne corks at NFL headquarters in New York. A season that began in turmoil has reached its midpoint and the league is riding a new high, with television ratings up and fans filling stadiums to cheer their favorite teams.\n\nSuddenly, the NFL is fun once again.\n\nIt showed Sunday in a shootout in New Orleans that was widely entertaining even without the touchdown props. Then, if any further evidence was needed, it was provided in prime time when Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers squared off in a showdown of quarterback greats.\n\nBrady and the New England Patriots won that one, and once again are treating another visit to the Super Bowl as their birthright. Out west, meanwhile, the Rams are trying to win fans again in Los Angeles with a team that could find its way to Atlanta, too.\n\nAnd a new group of exciting young quarterbacks are letting everyone know the future of the sport is in good hands.\n\nWhat could go wrong? Well, plenty, especially if President Trump takes an interest in the league once again.\n\nBut these are good times for a league that has taken blow after blow the last few years only to emerge with its position of America's favorite sport safely intact.\n\n\"We're the best,\" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said at last month's owner meetings. \"And I know that's ironic since we've had some criticism, too. But I think that's healthy.\"\n\nWhat is really healthy are offenses around the league, with scoring at record levels and 27 of 32 teams averaging more than 20 points a game. New rule changes designed to protect the quarterback and free up offenses have worked exactly as planned, despite some grumbling early by players upset they couldn't hit like they did in the past.\n\nHealthy indeed. Things are so good that even Roger Goodell couldn't mess it up.\n\nActually, maybe he can. Not many were paying attention, but there were still a few protests during the anthem over the weekend and the issue is one presidential tweet away from blowing up once again.\n\nMeanwhile, Colin Kaepernick remains unemployed, something everyone in the league should be ashamed about.\n\nFor now, though, the attention is on the game itself. And it can be argued that the game has never looked better.\n\nThere's no confusion anymore about when a catch is really a catch, and even Clay Matthews of the Packers seems to have figured out how and when to safely take down the opposing quarterback.\n\nThere are dominant teams on both coasts, and a few high scoring games that are reminiscent of the old American Football League. The concussion issue has subsided, though the disturbing fact remains players are still suffering from them \u2014 at great risk to their long term health.\n\nEven fans of the hapless Cleveland Browns have something to be happy about with a couple of wins and a couple coaches fired. They also have a franchise quarterback in Baker Mayfield and a potential upside that's the envy of better teams.\n\nIt didn't happen exactly by design. A lot of the NFL's good fortune is due to good luck and an unwillingness of fans to let go of their favorite sport despite its many flaws.\n\nThere still is no real grand plan to end the protest debate, no long term solution to the fact football played at the highest level can shorten lives. The officiating continues to get in the way \u2014 often at just the wrong time \u2014 and there's a real chance games aren't played when the current collective bargaining agreement expires and players finally make a stand for guaranteed contracts.\n\nFor now, though, those are distant threats. The league remains the most popular in the country by far, and the addition of legalized betting around the country will boost it even more just like fantasy football has done in recent years.\n\nWhat once looked like a season lost is now looking like a season to remember.\n\n____\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

Colorado forward Evan Battey, left, and guard McKinley Wright IV take questions during the Pac-12 NCAA college basketball media day in San Francisco. Battey, a redshirt freshman from California, is preparing to take the court for the team, a debut delayed by almost a year after he suffered a stroke and two seizures last December during a pickup game with friends. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOULDER, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Just the other day, the 6-foot-8 redshirt freshman quietly slipped on his Colorado basketball jersey for a photo shoot.\n\nInstant tears. A simple task he doesn't take for granted .\n\nLast December, Evan Battey was playing hoops with his buddies when his right leg went numb. Then, his right arm. He tried to speak but couldn't. Battey suffered a stroke that day along with two seizures.\n\nNearly 11 months later, the 20-year-old forward from California will make his Buffaloes debut \u2014 with feeling back and his speech constantly improving.\n\n\"I'm thankful to be out here,\" said Battey, whose team opens the season next Tuesday against Drake. \"I'm thankful just to be alive today.\"\n\nLooking back, there were signs for Battey, who redshirted last season due to NCAA eligibility requirements. Like how two months before his stroke he was unable to pronounce words following a weightlifting session. He texted his mom, Rosalind Lewis, that he felt funny.\n\nBut his speech soon returned. He pushed the episode from his mind, because \"I was in the best shape of my life at the time,\" Battey explained .\n\nThe day after Christmas, Battey and his buddies were playing basketball at a Los Angeles gym when he experienced numbness from head-to-toe. His friends called his mom, who happened to be a few minutes away and quickly drove over. By the time she arrived, he was walking on his own but his speech appeared weakened. She took him to the emergency room where doctors performed a scan and discovered a blood clot. He was given a drug to break up the clot and transported to another facility specializing in strokes. While in the ambulance, Battey suffered a seizure. At the facility, he had another.\n\nAfter four days in the hospital going through a battery of neurological and cardiology exams, the doctors had no explanation for what caused his stroke. It remains unknown.\n\n\"The good news was the tests came back as, 'Hey, we don't feel like there's going to be long-term effects,'\" Colorado coach Tad Boyle said.\n\nAt first, Battey's balance was off. He struggled to make a fist with his right hand. His smile was uneven. But everything gradually returned through physical therapy. His speech remains a work in progress.\n\nTwo weeks after his stroke, the Buffaloes were playing at Southern California and Battey attended morning practice. For the first time \u2014 and with his right arm still feeling weak \u2014 he shot a few 3-pointers.\n\nHe made one. Then another. And another.\n\n\"I was feeling it,\" he said. \"I was making them all from muscle memory. It was a good sign for my teammates to see that I'm shooting again.\"\n\nBattey returned to Boulder in time for January classes, diligently going through physical rehab (he struggled to write) and speech therapy (he recited song lyrics to progress enunciation). He attended home games to cheer on his teammates.\n\n\"It was hard, because I couldn't be that vocal guy on the sideline,\" he said. \"Because when you have a stroke, you know what you want to say, you just can't articulate it.\"\n\nBy early May, he had most of the feeling back on his right side and returned to practice. At first, he was a little hesitant: What if it happened again?\n\nTake his time. No rush. That was Boyle's message. It's been his message.\n\nBoyle had a conversation with Battey soon after his stroke: His scholarship was good even if he didn't play a minute with the Buffaloes. All he wanted was Battey to be healthy.\n\nBut his desire to play was burning. He hadn't played for a school team in quite a while.\n\nBattey missed his senior season at Villa Park High School in Orange County because of an eligibility rule stemming from him repeating the ninth grade. Instead, the affable Battey served as a coach for the big men and the team's JV squad that season.\n\nHis academic issues followed him to Boulder with the NCAA ruling him out since he did not meet the initial eligibility requirement of graduation from high school in four years.\n\nSteadily, he's getting back into a rhythm again.\n\n\"I sometimes think about my health when I'm sitting in class or lying in bed, but not when I'm on the floor,\" said Battey , who played 27 minutes and had seven points in an exhibition game against Colorado School of Mines over the weekend. \"I just love the game so much.\"\n\nAt practice, Battey wears a heart monitor (the entire team does). If his soars too high, he rests. He will be closely monitored in games by the Colorado training staff.\n\n\"We know what's normal and when things become abnormal, we'll be quick to shut him down,\" Boyle said. \"Up to this point, he's been fine.\"\n\nThis summer went a long way toward alleviating any lingering doubt. He traveled with the USA East Coast team on a four-game trip to Italy. Along for the excursion were his mom and sister.\n\n\"I needed to be there,\" his mom said, \"to see how he was doing and see him in that environment. It was wonderful.\"\n\nLast week, Battey stayed after practice to hone the foot work on his jumper.\n\nOn the far end, Boyle just watched.\n\n\"I'm not sure I've had as much respect for a player I've coached, in terms of what they've been through off the court, as I have been for Evan Battey,\" Boyle said. \"My expectation level of Evan is so high, because I think he has an opportunity to be such a good player.\"\n\nFor Battey, the excitement is already building for opening night. His mom will be there. Same with his dad, Earl.\n\n\"I don't know how I'm going to control my emotions,\" Battey said. \"But I'm ready. I'm ready.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Coaches made some curious calls, assertions and admonitions in Week 9 as the NFL hit the halfway point with some real head-scratchers.\n\nOakland coach Jon Gruden insisted the silver and black is still golden, saying he's getting calls from players dying to play for the Raiders (1-7) next season.\n\nHue Jackson suggested the Browns should have shown more patience before showing him the door with a 3-36-1 record, and his replacement, Gregg Williams, swore he'd turned down multiple head coaching offers since his firing by the Bills in 2003.\n\nMatt Patricia, the latest disciple of Bill Belichick to discover just how hard it is to win without Tom Brady, had no problem with a reporter's question so much as his poor posture, apparently averse to any kind of slump.\n\nAnd Broncos embattled coach Vance Joseph admitted he got greedy in sending Brandon McManus out for a 62-yard field goal with 22 seconds left before halftime Sunday, a costly decision that backfired and resulted in a six-point swing in a gut-wrenching two-point loss to the Texans.\n\nRAIDERS NADIRS\n\nIn an interview with Fox Sports that aired before Oakland's 34-3 shellacking at the hands of the 49ers, Gruden told Raiders Hall of Famer Howie Long that said his trades of two of his biggest stars in Khalil Mack and Amari Cooper hasn't affected other players' desires to play for the Raiders in 2019.\n\n\"I got a cellphone just like you and everybody else,\" Gruden said. \"I get a lot of phone calls from people that are dying to come play here. I'm just telling you. They're dying to play for the Raiders.\"\n\nOakland may have nearly $70 million cap space to go with three first-round draft picks next April, but doesn't talking to potential free agents teeter on tampering?\n\nHUE'S VIEW\n\nJackson said he could have turned things around in Cleveland if given more time.\n\n\"I was surprised that I was not given the opportunity to display what I could do as a play caller with a much more talented roster,\" Jackson told Cleveland.com after he was fired along with offensive coordinator Todd Haley following the Browns' 25th consecutive road loss.\n\nJackson said he thought No. 1 overall pick Baker Mayfield will be successful but he lamented the Browns passing on quarterbacks Carson Wentz, Deshaun Watson and Patrick Mahomes in recent years as Cleveland chose to stockpile draft picks.\n\nWILD WILLIAMS\n\nThe real eye-opener in Cleveland was Williams' wild claims in his first news conference as interim head coach. Williams had served as defensive coordinator for several teams since his firing as head coach in Buffalo 15 years ago, but he said that was only because he had turned down multiple offers to be a head coach again.\n\nHe said he had \"11 letters sent in to interview for head coaching jobs\" and \"four of them I didn't even have to show up, just sign the contract and come.\"\n\nThe NFL suspended Williams for the 2012 season after ruling that while the Saints defensive coordinator he orchestrated a program by which players were paid for knocking opponents from a game.\n\n\"That thing was a long time ago,\" Williams said when asked if he ever imagined being a head coach again. \"That's nothing that we're talking about now.\"\n\nSERGEANT SIT-UP-STRAIGHT\n\nDetroit's rookie head coach had a terse exchange with a reporter while discussing the Lions' trade of leading receiver Golden Tate to the Philadelphia Eagles, a team they could be fighting in the NFL wild-card race, for a third-round pick, a move that could hurt in the short-term but pay dividends down the road.\n\nWhen the reporter asked why he thought this move makes the Lions better, Patricia snapped, \"Do me a favor and just kind of sit up, just like, have a little respect for the process.\"\n\nThis from a coach who wore sweatpants to meet the media during Super Bowl week last February.\n\nThe reporter promptly sat up straight, asked his question again, and Patricia politely answered.\n\nAfter the Lions' 24-9 loss at Minnesota in which Matthew Stafford was sacked 10 times, the Detroit News trolled Patricia with this bold headline above a photo of the prone QB: \"Poor Posture .\"\n\nVEXED VANCE\n\nJoseph lost for the 17th time in 25 games Sunday when Brandon McManus missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired, turning a potential 20-19 thriller into a crushing 19-17 loss to the Texans and former teammate Demaryius Thomas.\n\nJoseph was left to answer questions for two days about his questionable decisions at the end of both halves.\n\nMcManus also missed from 62 yards in the second quarter, leaving the Texans with the ball at the Broncos 48 and 18 seconds left, enough time for Deshaun Watson to get Houston into field goal range itself.\n\nThe six-point swing proved the difference when McManus missed consecutive field goals for the first time in his five-year NFL career, pushing his 51-yarder wide right as time expired in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"The one before half, that was totally on me. I was chasing points,\" Joseph said Monday.\n\nBut the game-ender? No apologies for not trying to get closer after reaching the Texans 33.\n\nNot with Whitney Mercilus, Jadeveon Clowney and J.J. Watt working against a makeshift line that had lost center Matt Paradis to a broken right leg earlier in the game.\n\nSaid Joseph: \"I wasn't going to expose our quarterback and our O-line to that pass rush one more time and now if they make a play, now we're all idiots, right?\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 They may be on opposite sides of the aisle, but James Clyburn and Steve Scalise are on the same mission.\n\nIn the final stretch leading up to Election Day, both House leaders have been crisscrossing the country campaigning for candidates in some of the most competitive races this cycle. Both have a lot to gain.\n\nClyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, and Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, are the third-ranking leaders for their parties. If their side wins enough seats Tuesday to control the House, they are poised to move up in leadership and even possibly compete for the top job as speaker of the House.\n\nThey say they aren\u2019t angling to challenge California\u2019s Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi or GOP Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who have both made clear they want to be speaker, but political experts said Clyburn and Scalise could be laying the groundwork for higher leadership posts as they stump for candidates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that it\u2019s a strict quid pro quo, but if someone came to your district and campaigned for you and helped get you elected or re-elected, you might think twice before voting for someone else for leadership,\u2019\u2019 said Pearson Cross, a political scientist at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\n\nClyburn, the assistant Democratic leader and a former majority whip, said he hasn\u2019t ruled out running for speaker, but he won\u2019t challenge Pelosi. He doesn\u2019t know yet what post he will seek.\n\n\u201cI do plan to do what is necessary to remain at the leadership table,\u201d said Clyburn, adding that he will assess his options after the election. \u201cI learned when I was majority whip how to count \u2026 You have to look at what the margins are.\u201d\n\nScalise, the majority whip, also said he won\u2019t take on McCarthy for speaker, which will be open because Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan is retiring. Scalise said he\u2019s interested in becoming majority leader.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to first make sure that we hold the House to be able to then have an opportunity to compete for a position as important as that,\u201d Scalise said.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., right, and Republican Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., speak to reporters before a reception for Roskam at the Chicago Marriot Hotel-Naperville, Oct. 17, 2018, in Naperville, Ill. (Photo: Rich Hein/Chicago Sun-Times via AP)\n\nWith little to worry about in their own re-election bids, Clyburn and Scalise have been deployed to mostly toss-up races.\n\nScalise recently campaigned in the Midwest and South, including stumping for Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, who is facing a challenge from Democrat Colin Allred.\n\nClyburn spent a recent week in the South and the Northeast, campaigning with Democrats, including Andy Kim in New Jersey, who is in a tight race against Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would be satisfied with doing the easy stuff,\u201d Clyburn said in a recent telephone interview between stops in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. \u201cI don\u2019t do easy. I try to make a difference ... We\u2019re trying to break through here.\u201d\n\nDemocrats need a net gain of 23 seats to take control of the House.\n\nScalise concedes Republicans may not hold on to as many seats, but is confident the GOP will remain in the majority.\n\n\u201cI think you can see the momentum going our way,\" Scalise in a recent telephone interview with USA TODAY as he boarded a plane to Texas. \u201cI feel it when I go to swing districts and I see it in the enthusiasm of vulnerable members and their supporters.\"\n\nPolitical experts said efforts by Scalise and Clyburn help build loyalty from candidates who could be future colleagues and who could support their leadership campaigns.\n\nCross said it's smart for them to be coy about whether they will run for speaker.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no benefit to being seen as disloyal,\" he said. \u201cIf there is a revolt against McCarthy or Pelosi based on outcomes in the midterms \u2026 the person who would be the benefactor of that revolt does not want to seen as the person leading it.\"\n\nScalise on the move\n\nScalise, 53, a conservative who is serving his sixth term, has moved quickly up the leadership ladder. Before his role as majority leader, Scalise led the Republican Study Committee. He also headed the National Republican Congressional Committee's effort to recruit candidates,\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to earn everything I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be.\u2019\u2019\n\nScalise has been in the national spotlight more since last summer after he was nearly killed during a shooting at a congressional charity baseball practice. He was hospitalized for months, but returned to work last fall.\n\nIn addition to campaign stops, Scalise\u2019 office has touted that he helped raise nearly $5.4 million last month. Overall, he raised $9.5 million and transferred $2 million of that to the National Republican Congressional Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nScalise said he supports McCarthy for speaker, \u201cbut Kevin even knows that we have to hold the House or we\u2019re looking at minority positions \u2026 just in terms of the direction of the country it\u2019s not where we want to be.\u201d\n\nIf the GOP keeps the majority, Cross said Scalise could be in the running for higher leadership posts, including possibly speaker.\n\nBut Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, co-founder of the Freedom Caucus, is also running for speaker. And if he doesn\u2019t drop out, he\u2019s expected to pick up support from most of the three dozen members.\n\nCross said it helps that Scalise has a \u201cpersuasive\u201d personal story after the shooting.\n\n\u201cHe has a story of resilience, of conquering adversity and keeping a really, really sunny positive attitude,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s endeared him to everybody. Not only on the Republican side, but probably on the Democratic side too \u2013 although they wouldn\u2019t vote for him.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Whip Rep.

So you have to think about how much longer are you going to do this and will you miss your opportunity if she continues to serve.\"\n\nBelk said Clyburn would have to build a broader coalition, particularly beyond the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been around long enough and is a skilled enough politician with enough acumen to maybe try to push through,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a tremendous achievement. It would be a testament to his political skills \u2026 It\u2019s a hard road to glory, but it\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\n\nReps.

That's what he does,\" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns added 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Wolves.\n\nAfter resting Sunday in Portland, Butler scored Minnesota's first nine points of the fourth, twice getting the Timberwolves within one.\n\n\"We knew he was going to get in his rhythm so we tried to show him different defensive schemes,\" Harris said.\n\nThe Clippers answered both times the Wolves got close, with Williams scoring and Montrezl Harrell making consecutive baskets for a 98-93 lead.\n\nButler had just four points in the first half when Patrick Beverley defended him.\n\n\"He didn't limit me, by the way,\" Butler said, correcting a reporter. \"I was just playing not as aggressive in the first three quarters and then in the fourth I started attacking more.

I really don't care who likes it or doesn't.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Taj Gibson tripped over a sprawled Beverley on a rebound and Harrell knocked down Rose on a drive and got called for a foul on the other end.

Gibson received a technical foul.\n\nThe Clippers outrebounded the Wolves 43-38, including a 13-8 edge on the offensive glass.\n\n\"We've just got to find ways to get loose balls,\" Rose said. \"Once you get outrebounded and outhustled it's going to be pretty hard, especially when you give guys two to three looks at the rim.\"\n\nThe Clippers built an 11-point lead early in the third when Beverley came off the bench to hit a 3-pointer and make another basket.\n\nHelped by four straight points from Rose and a 3 by Andrew Wiggins, the Wolves trailed 92-84 heading into the fourth.\n\nThe teams played a tight first half, when they both shot 51 percent from the floor and neither led by more than six points.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTimberwolves: Fell to 0-3 on their West Coast trip with two games remaining. ...

That marked a season-low scoring total for any quarter by the Grizzlies.\n\nAt 10-1, the Warriors are off to the second-best start in franchise history behind the team of three years ago that began 24-0.

(AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 The Dallas Cowboys defense might want to delete that last group photo. It was a celebration that proved a bit premature.\n\nOn this Monday night, the Cowboys didn't defend their star in a 28-14 loss \u2014 except for Byron Jones shoving Kevin Byard when the Tennessee Titans safety did his best imitation of Terrell Owens' infamous taunting on the midfield logo 18 years ago.\n\n\"There's no need for it,\" Jones said. \"We're all having fun, but I think when you go and try to go on the star ... everyone knows what going on the star means.\"\n\nByrad's interception in the end zone of Dak Prescott's pass came right after Jaylon Smith recovered the second fumble by Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota and the Cowboys (3-5) looking to build on their early 7-0 lead.\n\n\"That was a big play in the ballgame not to be able to cash in there,\" coach Jason Garrett said. \"That was big in the game.\"\n\nJust two plays later, it looked like Smith had another recovery after what would have been Tennessee's third lost fumble in a five-minute span. The defense had already posed for another group photo, like it had after two fumbles by Mariota, before the play was overturned on a replay review.\n\nAfter keeping the ball, Mariota and the Titans (4-4) went on to finish a 15-play drive that tied the game. They didn't have any more turnovers and never trailed again.\n\n\"One thing that defensively that we try to uphold is creating turnovers,\" Jones said. \"You can't just do it in the first quarter and expect the game to go your way. You have to do it throughout the entire game.\"\n\nAmari Cooper had a 4-yard TD catch in his first game for the Cowboys, who sent a first-round pick to Oakland for the fourth-year receiver.\n\nAll three Dallas drives in the first quarter got into the red zone. There was a missed field goal before Cooper's TD, and Prescott's interception after that in their first home loss this season.\n\n\"I think the main thing is we had two no-scores in the red zone,\" running back Ezekiel Elliott said. \"It's hard to win a game in the NFL when you have two no-scores.\"\n\nCooper finished by catching five of the eight passes thrown his way for 58 yards \u2014 the interception was intended for him. Elliott had 17 carries for 61 yards.\n\nAlong with Cooper's debut, this was the first game for the Cowboys since offensive line coach Paul Alexander was fired less than halfway into his first season with the team. Former Dallas offensive lineman Marc Colombo, who had served as assistant offensive line coach since 2016, was promoted to take over as offensive line coach.\n\nIt was the first time Garrett has made an in-season change to his coaching staff, but there was no immediate turnaround.\n\nPrescott was sacked five times, losing a fumble when he tried to escape being tackled on one of them, and the Cowboys had only 72 yards rushing.\n\nWith the five sacks, Prescott has already been sacked 28 times halfway through this season. That is three more than his rookie season in 2016, and just short of the 32 sacks last season.\n\n\"I know that we had breakdowns,\" owner Jerry Jones said. \"I don't know that I expected the change to create a situation here you just didn't have breakdowns. I didn't think there would be enough to impact the game the way it did, and the way it did with Dak.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 After withstanding months of divisive politicking aimed at winning hearts and minds, the American electorate was making its own voice heard Tuesday in historic midterm elections serving as a mandate on President Donald Trump.\n\nBlue wave or red sea, the political fate of the nation was at stake as Democrats and Republicans grappled for control of the House and Senate, 36 governorships and thousands of state legislative seats.\n\nIn St. Clair, Michigan, Amanda Weidenbach was all-in after casting her ballot.\n\n\"I can't have a conversation with anybody without it being a major event,\" she said. \"Emotions are so high.\"\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans hold a razor-thin, 51-49 majority. Democrats' chances to flip control there are slim, however, because only nine of the 35 seats on the ballot were in Republican hands. In the House, Democrats will need to pick up 23 seats to gain a majority. History and the polls are on their side.\n\nHere are the things to watch as the electorate determines whether a Democratic \"blue wave\" sweeps the nation or liberals will instead will be seeing red when the final votes are tallied.\n\nMidterms: Races for governor, statehouses will help decide control of Congress for a decade\n\nMore: Election Day is here. Here's what you need to know before you cast your midterm ballot.\n\nThe House\n\nFor all midterm elections since the end of World War II, the president's party has lost an average of 25 seats in the House, according to Gallup. That number jumps to 37 seats for presidents with approval ratings below 50 percent. In most recent job-approval polling, Gallup puts President Donald Trump at 40 percent approval, CNN at 41 percent and Rasmussen right at 50 percent.\n\nRachel Bitecofer, with the Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University, sees the Democrats claiming a whopping net gain of 45 seats. She said that other number-crunching experts have slowly come closer to her estimate.\n\n\"At this point, if I am wrong, I will be in very good company,\" Bitecofer said.\n\nElections 2018: Here are the races to watch\n\nSenate seats\n\nFor Republicans to lose control of the Senate, Democrats would have to defend all 26 of their seats that are up for grabs and steal two from the GOP (or some scenario that nets them at least two seats). The pollsters at FiveThirtyEight only put the odds of the Democrats pulling that off at 19.5 percent.\n\nThere are three races in the East where Democrats are in tough re-election fights: Florida, Indiana and West Virginia. If they lose even one of those, it could kill their chances. If they drop two or more, Senate Republicans can go ahead and open the champagne.\n\n\"Democrats would need a near-perfect night to win the Senate,\" FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley said.\n\nMidterms: These Senate races will decide control in President Trump's Washington\n\nVoter turnout\n\nFoul weather threatened to impact turnout across much of the East, but politicos and pundits urged voters not to be dissuaded by the storms. The party that gets the most of its voters to the voting booth will be the one that wins the close races and congressional control.\n\n\"It\u2019s raining here and lots of places. So what?\" tweeted Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. \"You won\u2019t melt unless you\u2019re the Wicked Witch of the West. Go Vote!!\"\n\nPolls have indicated that voters on both sides are a lot more fired up for this election than most midterms, when turnout is typically much lower than years when the president is on the ballot. A poll Sunday from ABC News and The Washington Post found that 80 percent of registered voters are \"certain to vote\" or have already voted, compared with 65 percent in 2014 and 71 percent in 2010.\n\nMore: What's at stake? Both sides warn the future of our democracy is at risk\n\nFemale voters\n\nA key for Democrats will be the turnout of various demographic groups and one of the biggest will be female voters.\n\nFrom his defeat of the first female major party nominee for president to his own alleged sexual misconduct, Trump has outraged many women with his language, behavior and policies. The majority of them have consistently voted Democrat in recent elections. If they vote in large numbers Tuesday, that could be enough to flip control of the House.\n\nBonnie Slade, a 45-year-old black woman living in Potomac, Maryland, said Trump was part of what motivated her to vote Tuesday. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t stand for anything that I believe in, period,\u201d Slade said. \u201cI\u2019m a minority. I\u2019m a woman. And he\u2019s just not the best choice for me, personally, or my family.\u201d\n\nMidterm elections 2018: Women candidates could make history at all levels\n\nYoung voters\n\nAnother group Democrats are counting on that could determine the election outcome is America's youth.\n\nA poll last month from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics found that just 26 percent of voters age 18-29 approve of the job Trump has done as president. Fifty-five percent said they would like to see a Democratic majority in Congress (and that number jumps to 66 percent of likely voters in that age range).\n\nMillennial and Generation X voters now outnumber their more senior cohorts, according to the Pew Research Center. But they aren't the most reliable voters. In the 2014 midterms, voters from the younger generations made up 53 percent of eligible voters but cast 21 million fewer votes than members of the older ones.\n\n\"I just feel like it's important, especially with people my age, to get the votes out there,\" said Amanda McLeod, 20, after voting in St. Clair.\n\nMore: Young voter turnout in midterms is often dismal. This could be different\n\nAfrican-American voters\n\nThere were many factors that led to Trump's victory over Clinton, but a decline in African-American turnout was a big one. After voting in higher than normal numbers in races where Obama was on the ballot, those numbers receded in 2016.\n\nSome polls have indicated that Trump has made gains among black voters, but even the rosiest projections for the president would still mean massive opposition from African-Americans.\n\nTrump has been accused of racism by his critics and of sending \"dog whistles\" of solidarity to white supremacists. If those dog whistles backfire and draw African-American voters to the polls, they could carry a number of Democrats in close races \u2013such as Stacey Abrams in Georgia's gubernatorial race \u2013 to victory.\n\nMidterms 2018: These candidates of color are ready to make history\n\nLatino voters\n\nTrump has made immigration a centerpiece of the election. A caravan of thousands of Latinos walking through Mexico bound for the U.S. has drawn his ire, and he has sent troops to the border to keep the would-be immigrants out.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing with this caravan is pretty scary,\u201d said Jennifer Rager, 55, of Bozeman, Montana, after casting her vote. \u201cIt just feels like he\u2019s really trying to do a good job of protecting our country, you know?\"\n\nLatinos, however, are more energized than in past midterm elections. According to Pew, 55 percent of registered Latinos are enthusiastic about voting in this election, compared with 37 percent in the 2014 midterm. And 63 percent said in a September survey that they would vote for the Democratic candidate for Congress.\n\nMore: Donald Trump launches campaign tour by pounding immigration debate\n\nCLOSE Democrats are heading into Tuesday's high-stakes midterm elections with optimism, feeling strong about their chances of retaking the House of Representatives.

His inflammatory political style is a large part of why turnout is expected to be extremely high. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 72 percent of voters plan to vote to send a signal of opposition (40 percent) or support (32 percent) to the president.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's re-election bid has been more focused on Trump's policies than on those of GOP candidate Marc Molinaro.\n\n\"This election is not about my opponent,\" Cuomo said at a rally Monday. \"They are only soldiers in the army. This election is about the general of their army because they are just carrying orders for their general and their general is Donald Trump.\"\n\nMore: Donald Trump says 'everything' is at stake in closing election argument\n\nUSA TODAY/Suffolk poll: There is a 'Kavanaugh effect'\n\nThe Kavanaugh effect\n\nSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's contentious confirmation process is being hailed by both sides as an important factor in the election.\n\nAfter Kavanaugh was confirmed despite the allegations of sexual misconduct that nearly derailed him, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Democrats' tactics against him had the Republican base \"fired up.\" Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt predicted on \"Meet the Press\" that \"on Wednesday, everyone's going to be talking about Brett Kavanaugh.\"\n\nBut many Democrats believe that amid the #MeToo movement, women were outraged and further energized by Kavanaugh's confirmation.\n\nAn Oct. 24 USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that 35 percent of respondents said Kavanaugh's confirmation made them more likely to vote for a Democratic congressional candidate, while 27 percent said it made them more likely to vote for a Republican.\n\nContributing: Bob Gross and Joseph Spector, USA TODAY NETWORK; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/midterm-elections-2018-what-watch-election-day/1844919002/", "Jason Garrett and the Dallas Cowboys lost another ugly game Monday night, as they fell to the Titans at home, 28-14.\n\nIt was so bad that owner Jerry Jones made his way to the locker room before it was officially over:\n\n#Cowboys Jerry Jones with an early entry into postgame locker room \u2026 well ahead of his 3-5 team, well ahead of clock expiring #TENvsDAL pic.twitter.com/4QtxuICa3a \u2014 mike fisher \u272d (@fishsports) November 6, 2018\n\nThat can\u2019t be good.\n\nThe Cowboys are now 3-5 and missed out on a prime chance to stay in the race for the NFC East title.\n\nInstead, they got pummeled on Twitter:\n\nThis is one of the worst regular season losses from the #Cowboys in recent memory.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Without Kawhi Leonard, the Raptors used a balanced team effort to get their fourth straight win.\n\n\"We have been playing basically position-less basketball,\" said Kyle Lowry, who had 17 points and 11 assists to lead four Raptors with 17 points as Toronto beat the Utah Jazz 124-111 on Monday night.\n\nSerge Ibaka, OG Anunoby and Fred VanVleet also had 17 points as the Raptors were bolstered with six players in double figures to win their fourth straight game.\n\n\"Tonight was how our offense is supposed to be played,\" VanVleet said. \"As long as we're making shots, their defense has to respect the shooters and it allows us to play with more freedom out there.\"\n\nThe matchup lost some luster \u2014 and nearly 49 points a game \u2014 when Utah's Donovan Mitchell was ruled out with a left ankle sprain and Toronto's Leonard sat with a sore left ankle as well.\n\nBut the Raptors didn't miss a beat and their offensive spacing left the court wide-open for drives.\n\n\"Nobody likes to play in tight spaces, in congested spaces, so with an offense full of shooters, it's open and it's fun out there,\" VanVleet said.\n\nIbaka made all eight of his shots and has made 27 of his last 29 attempts.\n\n\"The guy is hot,\" Lowry said of Ibaka but he could have said it about a half-dozen Raptors. The point guard is certainly finding his shooters and has now posted nine consecutive games with 10 or more assists.\n\nAlec Burks led Utah with 22 points and Rudy Gobert had 14 points and 12 rebounds. After the game, Burks was so disgusted he said he had nothing to say to the media despite his scoring outburst.\n\nThe Raptors broke the game open with a 15-3 run that bridged the second and third quarter. The spurt was capped when Danny Green hit a 3-pointer to make it 71-55 for Toronto, which stretched the lead to as many as 26 early in the final period.\n\nThe last time the Jazz lost four in a row at home was in the 2013-14 season when they went 25-57.\n\n\"The little things that made us so good last year \u2014 we haven't really done any of them to this point,\" Joe Ingles said.\n\nThe Jazz got to the basket time and again but couldn't finish as the Raptors challenged them at the 3-point arc. Utah shot 8-of-31 from 3-point range, but that was skewed by the Jazz making three 3s in garbage time.\n\nDespite a 21-5 deficit in free throw attempts in the first half, the Raptors made eight 3s and shot 63 percent from the field to lead 65-54 at the break.\n\nHOME COOKING?\n\nThe Jazz haven't started 0-4 at home since their inaugural season in New Orleans in 1974-75. That season, the Jazz played in the Municipal Auditorium, and lost their first six home games before finally beating Portland behind Pete Maravich's 30 points.\n\nCOACH SEAT\n\nRick Pitino, who was fired in 2017 as Louisville's head coach, took in the game from a courtside seat within earshot of Utah coach Quin Synder.

The Nuggets won 115-107. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Jamal Murray simply got caught up in the moment when he hoisted a long shot with the clock winding down.\n\nHe took some heat for it. No disrespect meant, he maintained.\n\nMurray scored a career-high 48 points, including 19 in the fourth quarter, and the Denver Nuggets overcame a sluggish start to beat the Boston Celtics 115-107 on Monday night.\n\nThe point guard knew he was on from his first jumper \u2014 a deep 3-pointer. He realized he might have ruffled some feathers with his last \u2014 an even deeper 3 in an effort to score 50.\n\n\"My emotion took over as it normally does when I get going like that,\" Murray explained.\n\nMurray was feeling it all night, hitting 19 of 30 shots, including five 3s. He had two attempts to reach 50 points in the final seconds, but missed a reverse layup and then that 3 at the buzzer \u2014 one that bothered the Celtics with the game already decided.\n\n\"What kind of competitor wouldn't it bother? I was (mad), but we're not going to make a big thing about it,\" said Kyrie Irving, who scored 31 points on 13-of-17 shooting. \"But congratulations to him on 48 points. He did it in a great fashion.\"\n\nNuggets coach Michael Malone said the veterans on his team talked to Murray about the late shot.\n\n\"He's young. He's still learning,\" Malone said. \"You never want to try to disrespect anybody. It wasn't disrespect. He was trying to get to 50 points.\"\n\nAt 9-1, the Nuggets are earning a measure of respect around the NBA as they're off to their best start since 1976-77. They're 6-0 at home, including wins over Golden State and now Boston.\n\n\"We've accomplished nothing,\" Murray said. \"Keep trusting each other and get the job done.\"\n\nDenver spotted the Celtics an 18-point lead in the first quarter but quickly made up ground behind Murray, who scored 23 in the first half.\n\nIn a matchup between two of the league's top defenses, it was offense that ruled on this night.\n\nMore specifically, Murray.\n\nHe took over the game in the fourth quarter, hitting a pair of 3-pointers to give the Nuggets some breathing room. The Celtics even tried to double-team him.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\n\"He was rolling,\" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. \"He got a couple of easy ones out of the gate that I think made him feel good. He deserves credit.\"\n\nThe Nuggets needed a big game from Murray because the Celtics found some rhythm. Malone knew it was just a matter of time before a streaky Boston offense started consistently knocking down jumpers. He was just hoping it would happen after Monday.\n\n\"Their offense is trending in the right direction,\" Malone said. \"Couple that with their defense, which can be suffocating at times, and that's what makes them such a dangerous team \u2014 a team that's going to go very, very deep in the playoffs.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nCeltics: G Marcus Smart took an elbow to the back of the head from Nikola Jokic in the third quarter. ...

(Photo: Tim Bradbury, Getty Images)\n\nThe worst scandal in U.S. Olympic history, and the worst sex abuse scandal in sports history, was met with a long-awaited and entirely fitting response by the U.S. Olympic Committee Monday night.\n\nThe USOC has begun the process of shutting down USA Gymnastics, the organization responsible for the scandal in which hundreds of girls and young women were sexually abused by team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nHallelujah!\n\nIf decertification does in fact take place \u2014 a rare and extreme action within the U.S. Olympic movement \u2014 USA Gymnastics will be no more. It will cease to exist as the national governing body for one of the most popular and successful American sports in the Olympic Games.\n\nIn other words, it will receive the fate it richly deserves.\n\nAnd it will answer the question that has been asked about USA Gymnastics for many months now: how much dysfunction can one organization be allowed to produce before the guardians of the U.S. Olympic movement say enough is enough?\n\nMore: USOC begins process of revoking USA Gymnastics' status as governing body\n\nUSOC CEO Sarah Hirshland, who has been on the job for less than three months, made it clear that Monday was that day.\n\n\u201cYou deserve better,\u201d Hirshland said in an open letter to all USAG gymnasts and the U.S. gymnastics community at large. \u201cYou might be asking why now? The short answer is that we believe the challenges facing the organization are simply more than it is capable of overcoming in its current form. We have worked closely with the new USAG board over recent months to support them, but despite diligent effort, the NGB continues to struggle. And that\u2019s not fair to gymnasts around the country.\u201d\n\nWhile some wonder what took so long in a horrifying scandal that first was made public in August 2016, it\u2019s important to note that decertification is the nuclear option of the Olympic world. Because it is so final and far-reaching \u2014 forcing a sport with more than 150,000 athletes and 3,000 clubs around the country to essentially begin anew \u2014 Olympic leaders are wise to search for other solutions first.\n\n\n\nIn late August, Hirshland had been USOC CEO for just 11 days when she blasted USA Gymnastics in an email to USA TODAY, saying \u201cit is time to consider making adjustments in the leadership.\u201d\n\nFour days later, Kerry Perry resigned after a disastrous nine-month run as USAG CEO.\n\nHirshland could have called for decertification right then and not a soul would have blamed her. But so new in her own role, she wisely watched and waited.\n\nWhat she saw was not good. On Oct. 12, USA Gymnastics announced former U.S. Congresswoman Mary Bono would serve as interim CEO. On Oct. 16, Bono resigned after a controversial tweet and concern over her affiliation with the law firm that helped the governing body cover up Nassar\u2019s assaults on numerous young gymnasts.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Hirshland move to decertify USA Gymnastics on Oct. 17? The timing would have seemed right, and she certainly would have had all the evidence she needed.\n\nShe didn\u2019t do it out of deference to Olympic champion Simone Biles and the other members of the U.S. gymnastics team about to compete at the world championships in Doha, Qatar. Had steps been taken to decertify then, the news would have been a constant and unfair distraction for the American gymnasts, casting a shadow over Biles\u2019 historic fourth world individual all-around title and the U.S. women\u2019s fourth consecutive team championship.\n\nNow that the worlds are over, with no significant international gymnastics events on the horizon for several months, the time was right for the USOC to make this historic stand for its athletes.\n\nThere are risks involved with shutting down an organization of the size and magnitude of USA Gymnastics. Tearing down the house doesn\u2019t come without great concerns. Who will run the new national governing body? Who runs the organization in the interim? What happens to every-day logistics?\n\nThe questions will mount. The answers won\u2019t be easy. But for the first time since the horrific sex abuse scandal came to light days before the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, it can safely be said that these courageous gymnasts, these athletes who have served as the conscience of their sport, have finally had their day.", "Jason Garrett and the Dallas Cowboys lost another ugly game Monday night, as they fell to the Titans at home, 28-14.\n\nIt was so bad that owner Jerry Jones made his way to the locker room before it was officially over:\n\n#Cowboys Jerry Jones with an early entry into postgame locker room \u2026 well ahead of his 3-5 team, well ahead of clock expiring #TENvsDAL pic.twitter.com/4QtxuICa3a \u2014 mike fisher \u272d (@fishsports) November 6, 2018\n\nThat can\u2019t be good.\n\nThe Cowboys are now 3-5 and missed out on a prime chance to stay in the race for the NFC East title.\n\nInstead, they got pummeled on Twitter:\n\nThis is one of the worst regular season losses from the #Cowboys in recent memory.

(Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2013 The Cowboys had 15 days, a trade for new receiver Amari Cooper and firing of their offensive line coach to prepare for a 3-4 Tennessee Titans team. Still, they struggled to produce at home.\n\nThe result: Dallas surrendered its first loss at AT&T Stadium this season, dropping to 3-5 and generating more questions about head coach Jason Garrett\u2019s status with the team.\n\nThe two teams screamed of symmetry at times, from turnovers by quarterbacks Marcus Mariota and Dak Prescott (two each) to both teams missing a field goal.\n\nBut the Titans came through when it mattered in the 28-14 win. The Cowboys repeatedly fell short.\n\nHere are three things we learned about the Cowboys and Titans:\n\n1. Turnovers galore: The Cowboys defense started quickly, with linebacker Sean Lee recovering a fumble after DeMarcus Lawrence notched a strip-sack on Mariota with 8:18 to play in the first quarter. Just one drive later, linebacker Jaylon Smith recovered Mariota\u2019s second fumble.\n\nTennessee\u2019s defense followed suit. Free safety Kevin Byard picked off Prescott, who was trying to find Cooper despite double coverage, in the end zone in the first quarter and celebrated Terrell Owens-style on Dallas' star at midfield. On third-and-13 in the third quarter, Prescott lost another ball. Titans linebacker Jayon Brown pulled off the strip-sack this time and Wesley Woodyard recovered at the Dallas 40.\n\nPrescott now has turned the ball over twice in 10 games since the beginning of 2017, bumping him into a four-way tie for league-worst with Jameis Winston, Derek Carr and DeShone Kizer. Kizer and Winston have each lost their starting jobs in that stretch. Carr has lost Cooper.\n\nEfficient Titans: Neither the Cowboys nor the Titans were consistent, but Tennessee capitalized when it mattered. The Titans converted on third down 79 percent of the time (11-of-14) to Dallas\u2019 45 percent (5-of-11). Tennessee also won in the red zone, scoring on four of five trips to Dallas\u2019 one of four. Mariota looked the part of superior mobile quarterback, extending Tennessee\u2019s lead to 28-14 with a 9-yard score in the game\u2019s final five minutes. Mariota rushed eight times for 36 yards \u2013 including several third-down conversions \u2013 and a score on the day to complement his 21-of-29, 240-yard passing performance.\n\nPrescott, who rushed 11 times for 82 yards in Dallas\u2019 last home game (40-7 win over Jaguars), carried just twice for 11 yards in the loss.\n\nCooper provides a boost: Cooper led Cowboys receivers in his first game with 58 yards and a score, catching five of eight targets from Prescott. But the receiver Dallas forfeited a 2019 first-round pick for wasn\u2019t a cure-all solution Monday night. Ezekiel Elliott averaged just 3.59 yards a carry (61 yards on 17 tries) while he amassed 112 total yards.\n\nPrescott finished 21-of-31 for 243 yards, two touchdowns and two turnovers.\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.", "CLOSE Facebook has unveiled its new election war room designed to assist employees with finding and deleting fake news and bogus accounts aimed at interfering with elections. (Oct. 18) AP\n\nA Facebook Elections sign. (Photo: John Minchillo, AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Acting on a tip from law enforcement, Facebook has removed more than 100 accounts \u2013 30 on Facebook, 85 on Instagram \u2013 engaging in coordinated activity in French, English and Russian, raising the possibility that foreign actors are attempting to meddle on the eve of the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nFacebook said it was alerted Sunday night to the suspicious activity that law enforcement believe may be linked to foreign entities and blocked the accounts in question. Almost all the Facebook pages appear to be in French or Russian while the Instagram accounts were mostly in English. Some were focused on celebrities, others on political debate, Facebook said.\n\n\"Typically, we would be further along with our analysis before announcing anything publicly. But given that we are only one day away from important elections in the U.S., we wanted to let people know about the action we've taken and the facts as we know them today,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said in a blog post. \"Once we know more \u2013 including whether these accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency or other foreign entities \u2013 we will update this post.\"\n\nThe investigation into the activity was announced late Monday. The company said it was too early in its investigation to determine who was behind the effort or how long the accounts had been operating. Facebook said it does not know how many people may have interacted with the Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nA joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI said law enforcement is working in \"unprecedented ways\" to combat foreign influence operations.\n\n\"Americans should be aware that foreign actors \u2013 and Russia in particular \u2013 continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord,\" the statement said. \"They can do this by spreading false information about political processes and candidates, lying about their own interference activities, disseminating propaganda on social media, and through other tactics.\"\n\nWith Americans headed to the polls Tuesday, social media companies are on high alert for foreign interference. They are eager to show they will not permit a repeat of the 2016 presidential election during which Kremlin-linked Russian operatives at the Internet Research Agency used Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter to spread divisive messages on hot-button topics such as race and immigration to influence how people voted.\n\nMore: Facebook uncovers Iran disinformation to sow political discord over Trump, race\n\nAlso: We read every one of the 3,517 Facebook ads bought by Russians. Here's what we found\n\nAfter heavy criticism from lawmakers for failing to detect and purge election meddling in 2016, Facebook has made safeguarding elections around the world one of its top priorities. It has set up an elections \"war room\" on its campus in Menlo Park, California, where data scientists, engineers and other employees monitor foreign election manipulation, disinformation, voter suppression and other security challenges under a large American flag. It's also hired more people and strengthened automated systems to monitor what's posted on Facebook and it has introduced tighter controls on whocan buy political ads.\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors that his company was getting better at detecting foreign election interference but that \"there are going to be things that our systems miss, no matter how well tuned we are.\"\n\nIn August, Facebook said it foiled political influence campaigns originating out of Iran and Russia that targeted U.S. users ahead of the midterm elections. The campaigns, which mimicked previous Kremlin-linked efforts to stir political discord around hot-button issues, also targeted users in the U.K., the Middle East and Latin America in a bid to sway world politics.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Facebook said it had uncovered another covert Iranian disinformation campaign which attempted to sow political discord in the U.S. on divisive issues ahead of the November midterm elections. The drumbeat of revelations underscore the difficult task of protecting elections from foreign interference on social media.\n\nIran and Russia have denied any involvement in Facebook disinformation campaigns.\n\nMore: Russian Facebook ads inflamed Hispanic tensions over immigration after Trump election\n\nRelated: Facebook foils political influence campaigns originating in Iran, Russia ahead of U.S. midterms\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/05/facebook-foreign-election-meddling-ahead-midterms/1899284002/", "Tennessee Titans nose tackle Austin Johnson (94) sacks Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) during the second half of an NFL football game, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Kevin Byard secured the interception that sparked the sluggish Tennessee Titans and turned toward midfield.\n\nThe flashback for the Dallas Cowboys was just as disheartening as the original.\n\nByard mimicked Terrell Owens' mocking celebration on the star logo at the 50-yard line from 18 years ago, Marcus Mariota accounted for three touchdowns and the Titans spoiled Amari Cooper's Dallas debut with a 28-14 victory on Monday night.\n\nThe end-zone pick of Dak Prescott came after Mariota fumbled on the first two Tennessee possessions. Just as T.O. did at old Texas Stadium 18 years ago, Byard ran to midfield, under the huge videoboard at spacious AT&T Stadium, and spread his arms.\n\nOwens did it twice in a blowout San Francisco win over a bad Dallas team that time. This win by the Titans (4-4) ended their three-game losing streak while handing the Cowboys (3-5) their first loss in four home games and making their road to the playoffs a difficult one.\n\n\"It was huge,\" Mariota said of Byard, while adding that he didn't see the celebration. \"The defense has done an unbelievable job throughout the year in building us up. They found ways to give us plays, to get turnovers.\"\n\nThe Cowboys looked like the team headed for a blowout win, but led just 7-0 after Mariota's early miscues because of Brett Maher's missed 38-yard field goal on the opening possession and Prescott's ill-advised throw into double coverage.\n\n\"That was the difference. Simple as that,\" said Prescott, who lost a fumble at his 40-yard line to set up Tennessee's tiebreaking score in the third quarter. \"Defense gives a turnover there. We're up seven points and I go down there and try to force the ball and give it right back to them.\"\n\nCooper scored the first Dallas touchdown after DeMarcus Lawrence stripped the ball from Mariota . The two-time Pro Bowl receiver finished with five catches for 58 yards after coming over from Oakland in a trade for a first-round pick during the open week.\n\nGiven another chance when what would have been a third straight fumble to start the game was overturned by a review that showed Luke Stocker didn't have the ball long enough on a catch, Mariota led an 80-yard drive capped by Derrick Henry's 1-yard plunge for a 7-7 tie.\n\nMariota converted two third-and-9s with passes and a shorter third down with a run on his first TD drive, setting the stage for the Titans to convert 11 of 14 third downs.\n\nThe Cowboys fell flat in 15-year tight end Jason Witten's first trip home since retiring to become lead analyst for \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nDallas had just 108 yards in the second half \u2014 the bulk of those on a desperation drive down two scores late \u2014 and was booed several times at the end of failed drives.\n\nAfter getting sacked on third down with nobody realizing Tennessee had called timeout in a 7-7 game in the second quarter, Mariota completed a 36-yarder to Darius Jennings before a screen pass to Dion Lewis went 18 yards for a touchdown.\n\nMariota broke a 14-14 tie in the third quarter when he pulled the ball out of Lewis' gut at the last second and delivered a 7-yard shovel pass to Jonnu Smith to put the Titans ahead for good. Mariota's 9-yard scoring run all but sealed things with 4:38 to go.\n\nMariota was 21 of 29 for 240 yards without an interception and had 32 yards rushing. Lewis had 62 yards rushing and 60 receiving coming off a career-high 155 scrimmage yards in his last game.\n\nStar Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott finished with 61 yards after a hot start. Prescott was 21 of 31 for 243 yards and two scores \u2014 4 yards to Cooper and 23 yards to Allen Hurns. The two turnovers were Prescott's first at home this season.\n\nT.O. FLASHBACK\n\nThere was something else familiar about Byard's celebration: a Dallas defender trying to do something about it.\n\nGeorge Teague famously knocked Owens off the star back then, and Cowboys cornerback Byron Jones made a similar move on Byard and the group that joined the celebration. Owens seemed to get a kick out of the whole thing on Twitter.\n\n\"I was actually expecting somebody to knock my head off,\" said Byard, who thought about the possible celebration at the team hotel. \"I was like, 'If we get to the 50, if we get enough guys to the 50, we are just going to start dancing on the star.'\"\n\nWITTEN TRIBUTE\n\nThe Cowboys paid tribute to Witten with a pregame video on the giant board hanging over the field. The franchise leader in games, catches and yards receiving wiped his eyes when a small inset of him was shown during the video, but seemed to have gained his composure when he was shown on the full screen. Witten waved, smiled and tapped his chest around his heart several times as the crowd roared.\n\nINJURIES\n\nDallas LB Sean Lee pulled up with a hamstring injury while trying to cover Smith on a 26-yard completion to the Titans tight end.

This is only going to make our team stronger going forward.\"\n\nThe video was the latest humiliation for the organization over the past two years: owner Eugene Melnyk threatening to move the team; alleged cyberbullying involving the wife of former star captain Erik Karlsson; and harassment allegations against former assistant general manager Randy Lee.\n\nThe players in the Uber were Duchene, Chris Wideman, Chris Tierney, Thomas Chabot, Alex Formenton (since sent down to the juniors), Dylan DeMelo and Colin White.\n\nThey were discussing the team's ineffective penalty killing and mocking Raymond in what appears to be a recording from a camera mounted on the dashboard.\n\nUber Canada's General Manager Rob Khazzam said on his Twitter account that video taken of a private conversation without passenger consent is a \"clear violation of our terms of service.\" He said such conduct is \"totally unacceptable\" and merits investigation.\n\nNone of the players involved discussed the video Tuesday.\n\n\"As a leader of this team I want to be supporting my teammates,\" Stone said. \"It's something I never want anyone to go through with it. As a coaching staff and management and players, we're trying to form a bond that turns this team into the right direction and this is a hiccup, but I think we're on the right track of doing that.\"\n\nDefenseman Mark Borowiecki acknowledged the Senators would have to deal with the \"consequences\" and \"ramifications\" of the video.\n\n\"But we want to keep this in house as much as we can and deal with it appropriately,\" he said.\n\nIn the video, Duchene, one of the Senators' alternate captains, is heard saying: \"Marty Raymond, the only coach in NHL history to have the worst power-play and the worst PK within a calendar year.\"\n\nDuchene later adds that he hasn't \"paid attention in three weeks\" in Raymond's meetings.\n\nThe players apologized to Raymond in a statement Monday.\n\nRaymond, in his third season with the Senators, was responsible for the power play for much of last season and is in charge of the team's penalty-killing this year. Ottawa's penalty killing ranks 30th in the league.\n\nSenators coach Guy Boucher said the team is trying to move forward and concentrate on Tuesday night's home game against New Jersey.\n\n\"I don't know who makes decisions to put things like that out there, but when you purposely try to hurt another human being, I don't want to spend too much time on that, and especially probably the best human being I know (Raymond), that's personal,\" Boucher said.\n\nDuring the morning skate Duchene was seen talking and laughing with Raymond as the two held a brief conversation at center ice.\n\nThe matter has raised concerns about player privacy.\n\n\"We're all totally aware that any time someone says to you this is off the record ... nothing is off the record in your life. So let's get that straight,\" Toronto coach Mike Babcock said at the Maple Leafs' morning skate Tuesday.\n\nMany Maple Leaf players said it's imperative for players to be aware of their surroundings when having a private conversation. And defenseman Travis Dermott expressed some sympathy for the Ottawa players.\n\n\"I mean, tough bounce for them. They're going to have to deal with that, but it could happen to anyone, really.\"\n\nAdded Vegas Golden Knights winger Ryan Reaves: \"I would never expect a cab ride conversation to be made public, but that's the world we live in right now. Everybody's a snitch.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Adams wasn't so sure.\n\n\"I had a game plan, man, but honestly, he missed a lot of easy ones to be honest,\" Adams said. \"There was a lot of breakdowns. I got lucky on a few of them.\"\n\nIt was the sixth straight loss for New Orleans after opening the season with four wins.\n\n\"We're putting ourselves in position where we have to have a perfect storm to win,\" Gentry said. \"In other words, we dig in, make our run, we come back, but we're never ahead.

The Saints won 45-35. (AP Photo/Butch Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams didn't really aspire to perfection, and they didn't appear to be overly crushed when their unbeaten start to the season ended in New Orleans.\n\nThe Rams definitely dream of the Super Bowl, and coach Sean McVay believes their quest will get a major boost from the minor setback of Sunday's 45-35 loss to the powerhouse Saints.\n\n\"The sense we got from our players is that if anything, it creates an added sense of urgency,\" McVay said Monday night at the team's training complex. \"You know, that feeling in your gut where you wake up and you're just sick because you didn't get the result that you wanted is something that you can't create unless you do end up losing. We try to be consistent whether you win or lose, but there is something that is created just based on not getting the result that you wanted.\"\n\nThe Rams are 8-1 with a new reason to work hard after they failed for the first time in their remarkable season. Los Angeles' defense largely couldn't slow down Drew Brees and Alvin Kamara, while the Rams' high-octane offense couldn't quite keep up on the scoreboard despite rallying from a 21-point deficit to tie it.\n\nAfterward, several Rams players expressed a backhanded relief that the specter of a perfect season no longer hangs over the head of a franchise that is less than two years removed from a 4-12 finish. Defensive lineman Michael Brockers said LA's first loss \"might be a blessing in disguise.\"\n\nAnd McVay left the Superdome with plenty of teachable moments on video.\n\nMany of those lowlights occurred while the Rams fell behind 35-14 late in the first half. Those 35 points are the most allowed in a half by the Rams defense since 2008 \u2014 and that's saying something, since 2008 was the second of 10 consecutive losing seasons for this club.\n\nMcVay praised cornerback Marcus Peters for taking responsibility for his mistakes in coverage, but the coach also realizes the blame must be shared across the roster after giving up a season-worst 487 yards.\n\n\"I think with the expectations that our defense has, and that we have for them, they would expect to be better,\" McVay said. \"But there's a lot of credit that needs to go to the Saints. They're one of the top offenses in the league for a reason. ... It's a great tape for us to be able to look at, figure out what we can do as a defensive group to be able to respond the right way (and) use it as a chance to learn from it.\"\n\nThe Rams' 8-0 start was the franchise's best since 1969, and one loss hasn't stopped their historic turnaround. This franchise has won more than eight games just once in the previous 14 seasons \u2014 and that was last season, when McVay led the Rams to a seven-game improvement from 2016 with an 11-5 regular-season record.\n\nAfter the loss in New Orleans, several Rams also noted they have never lost back-to-back regular-season games under McVay. A visit from the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday is a chance for the Rams to keep that standard intact while essentially ending the NFC West race before mid-November.\n\n\"Can't wait to get back out and get another opportunity to compete and try to erase this feeling that you do have,\" McVay said. \"I feel like our building shares that same feeling. We're excited about getting to work.\"\n\nNOTES: The Rams added rookie OLB Ogbo Okoronkwo to their active roster and waived linebacker Trevon Young. Okoronkwo had foot surgery and went on the physically unable to perform list before training camp, which meant Los Angeles had to decide Monday whether to activate the fifth-round pick or put him on injured reserve. McVay hasn't decided how much Okoronkwo will play this season, but the coach was \"intrigued\" by what he saw in practice over the last three weeks. \"He's done some things that we felt like were positive, were encouraging,\" McVay said. ... The Rams have no new injuries from their trip, McVay said. LB Matt Longacre was evaluated for a concussion during the game in New Orleans, but he returned to action.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It's only the third time the Penguins have lost four straight under Mike Sullivan and the first time Pittsburgh has dropped four in a row at home under the fourth-year head coach.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After his team's first four skaters in the shootout couldn't beat goalie Thomas Greiss, Montreal Canadiens coach Claude Julien decided to go with the right-handed Joel Armia instead of Charles Hudon.\n\nThe move paid off.\n\nArmia scored in the fifth round on the first shootout attempt of his career to lift the Canadiens over the New York Islanders 4-3 on Monday night.\n\n\"We knew the glove side was the place to go, and you saw our lefties go to their backhand,\" Julien said. \"We had Hudie on our list there to go, but he was a left shot, so we opted for Armie, who has a quick release, and I thought that was going to give us the better chance.\"\n\nMax Domi and Jonathan Drouin each had a goal and an assist, Artturi Lehkonen also scored and Noah Juulsen added two assists. The Canadiens rallied from a 3-1 deficit after 20 minutes to win for the fifth time in the last six meetings with the Islanders.\n\n\"Everybody knew we weren't as good as we can be in the first period,\" Armia said. \"I think everybody knew that if we're going to have a chance to win this game, we're going to have to be a lot better, and I think we did a pretty good job of that.\"\n\nAntti Niemi started in place of Carey Price and made 21 saves before stopping all five of New York's attempts in the shootout. Montreal has won seven of 11 (7-3-1).\n\n\"We are a resilient group,\" Domi said. \"We bounced back and it was good to see. We know what it takes to win. It's fun. Winning is great. When you come back to win in another team's arena, it's even better.\"\n\nCasey Cizikas scored twice and Valtteri Filppula also had a goal for the Islanders, who snapped a season-high five-game winning streak. Greiss stopped 32 shots.\n\n\"We were awful, plain and simple,\" New York coach Barry Trotz said. \"The right team won tonight. That was our worst game of the year.\"\n\nThe Islanders went on the power play with 27 seconds left in regulation when the Canadiens were caught with too many men on the ice but came up empty on the man advantage for the fourth time in the game.\n\nTrailing by two after 20 minutes, the Canadiens came out with increased intensity in the second. They outshot the Islanders 15-6 and pulled within one with a power-play goal late in the period. Domi fired a shot from the right circle that beat a screened Greiss on the goalie's blocker side with 4:24 remaining. It was Domi's eighth goal and team-leading 15th point.\n\nMontreal nearly tied it almost two minutes later on another power play, but Jeff Petry's shot hit the goalpost.\n\nThe Canadiens then tied it at 7:43 of the third when Lehkonen scored on a tip in front on a long shot by Juulsen.\n\n\"We had a slow start that first period and we weren't ourselves,\" Julien said. \"We talked about what we needed to do ... and what needed to get better and I guess the guys just responded well.\n\n\"That's what you need to see. Not every game is going to be perfect. How you react to certain situations is important. I thought our reaction after the first was extremely good.\"\n\nThe Islanders got on the scoreboard first when Cizikas knocked in a loose puck off a rebound of Adam Pelech's shot from above the left faceoff circle 4:04 into the game for his first goal in eight games.\n\nThe lead lasted less than two minutes. Drouin got a pass from Domi and beat Greiss from the left circle for his fourth at 5:59.\n\nFilppula regained the lead for New York just 1:45 later. Komarov stole the puck from Brendan Gallagher and skated up the left side on a 2-on-1 rush, went around a sliding Canadiens defenseman and passed it in front to Filppula, who beat Niemi glove side with his fifth.\n\nCizikas skated up the left side on a 2-on-1 with Ross Johnston and tried to send a pass to his teammate. It deflected back to him off the skate of Montreal's Jordie Benn, and Cizikas beat Niemi for his fifth. It gave him his first multigoal game since Oct. 7, 2017, against Buffalo.\n\nNOTES: Domi has eight goals and four assists in his last 10 games. ...

But, it also could be a giant headache. USA TODAY\n\nAmazon employees tend to their dogs in a canine play area adjacent to where construction continues on three large, glass-covered domes as part of an expansion of the Amazon.com campus, Thursday, April 27, 2017, in downtown Seattle. (Photo: Elaine Thompson, AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 In the end, Amazon went for pragmatic, not dramatic.\n\nAfter it became clear finding a city that could lure 50,000 highly-paid tech workers wasn't as easy as it had thought, the Seattle company plans to add two new headquarters instead of one, both to spread the wealth and to give it access to the widest possible array of technical talent.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the process confirmed to USA TODAY that Amazon has made the decision to shift its placement of a second headquarters co-equal with Seattle from one city to two. The possibility was first reported Monday by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe two cities to be chosen aren't known, nor when they will be named, though the New York Times reported Monday they will be Northern Virginia and New York City. But the decision is very much in line with two things Amazon had said all along. First, it was looking for a second headquarter because it has a ferocious need for more talent than it can convince to move to Seattle. Second, Amazon makes decisions based on the facts and isn't afraid to change mid-course if the data shows it something new.\n\n\u201cMy immediate reaction was that having looked at the numbers, they decided they just couldn\u2019t get the amount of talent they needed in one place. You add that to concerns about increased costs and the congestion effect of having that much investment in one place, and you couple it with what\u2019s been going on in Seattle over the past few years, and you wonder if their calculations changed,\u201d said Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program.\n\nThis is a path Amazon has been going down for almost 10 years. More than a quarter of its U.S. tech and managerial workers are already based outside Seattle. The company currently has 17 North American tech hubs with a total headcount of at least 17,500 staffers.\n\nSome of the hubs started as an acknowledgment of a special tech expertise that had grown up in a specific area, some due to having purchased a company and leaving the staff in place, and others were simply bowing to the reality that not everyone wants to or can live in Seattle. For example, Amazon's Atlanta offices focus on fulfillment technologies, while Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania hosts machine translation research.\n\nAs any industry grows, it always becomes more of what is called \"multi-locational,\" said Michael Storper, a professor of regional and international development at the University of California at Los Angeles Luskin School of Public Affairs. Having Amazon spread its benefits to more regions is a favorable thing, he said.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S.A., we need to spread the benefits of economic development out more, because in the past 30 years, the level of inequality between our regions has risen to a point that is higher than in more than 100 years,\u201d Storper said.\n\nThe Seattle-based online retailer announced its search for a second home to huge public interest in September 2017, saying in its Request for Proposals that it envisioned investing up to $5 billion in the city it chose and adding as many as 50,000 new employees there, each of whom would make on average $100,000 a year.\n\nMore: Where will Amazon put its second headquarters? What you need to know\n\nAlso: Does Amazon already have a tech hub in your city? Check here\n\nRelated: An Amazon HQ2 timeline\n\nThe tempting offer sent cities across the United States, Mexico and Canada into a frenzy. By the time the deadline hit five weeks later, 238 proposals were submitted. In January, 20 finalists were announced, 19 in the United States and one in Toronto, Canada.\n\nBut while visions of throngs of wealthy taxpayers suddenly appearing in their cities lured many officials, others expressed concerns that an unprecedented flood of young, highly-educated, well-paid workers from elsewhere might destroy the very charm and culture of the cities that made them so alluring in the first place.\n\nThe issue has been played out very publicly in Seattle, where what The Seattle Times dubbed the \"Amazon Prosperity Bomb\" was one of the factors behind a bruising, months-long fight in which Amazon and other businesses squelched a new corporate head tax to fund homeless services.\n\nSeattle's tech-fueled economy led to rent increases that helped exacerbate a local problem of homelessness. It's just one example of the rapid and wrenching changes to the economic makeup of the city the arrival of Amazon's 45,000 well-paid staffers has brought. As recently as 2010, Amazon had only 10,000 employees there.\n\nAnxiety about what Amazon's arrival might mean in the finalist cities is high in some circles. Multiple companies have done analyses of what Amazon's HQ2 would do to rents in the chosen city, in some cases raising them by as much as 30 percent.\n\nThe view from Amazon's Day 1 headquarters in downtown Seattle. (Photo: Elizabeth Weise)\n\n\u201cOverall, a large influx of high-skilled jobs is great news, but our research shows that it can hurt poor renters, so cities are right to worry,\u201d said Victor Couture, a professor of real estate at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cFifty thousand highly-paid employees will need a place to live, and simple supply and demand arguments suggest that if housing supply is limited, house prices will rise.\u201d\n\nA survey of Austin residents found that only 30 percent said they perceived Amazon as a \"10\" on a scale of one to 10 when thinking about the company. In Denver, 16 percent said they were somewhat or strongly opposed to having Amazon to set up shop there.\n\nIn Atlanta, an anonymous group called Atlanta Against Amazon launched an online campaign against HQ2, ending its first blog post with \"Today is day 1 of resistance against HQ2.\" In Washington, D.C., a group called the Fair Budget Coalition launched Obviously Not DC, a campaign that echoed the District's pitch to Amazon, Obviously DC.\n\nThere's one city that isn't at all upset by the news. In Seattle, Mayor Jenny Durkan told local TV station KIRO that having a split HQ2 would be fine. \"I\u2019d call those branch offices. That would be good news,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/05/amazon-new-city-headquarters-new-york-city-seattle-virginia-workers/1897479002/", "bad url", "New Orleans forward Anthony Davis shoots the ball over Oklahoma City guard Russell Westbrook (0) in the first half of an NBA basketball game in Oklahoma City, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

Houston won 98-94. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 James Harden produced his typical scoring flurry Monday night. His teammates delivered the knockout blow with a staunch second-half defensive effort.\n\nOn a night the league's reigning MVP made a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 36.1 seconds left and closed it out by making four straight free throws, Harden was thrilled to see the Houston Rockets rediscover their winning combination in a 98-94 victory at Indiana.\n\n\"We're doing a really good job of getting stops and making it hard for teams to score,\" he said. \"I'm not worried about our offense. We're a really good offensive team. We're going to make shots. We need a pretty good defensive effort (each night).\"\n\nThe message seems to have sunk in.\n\nWhile Harden did his usual work with 28 points, six assists and five 3-pointers, the improving defense and a healthier roster has helped last season's Western Conference runner-ups punch their way out of an early-season corner.\n\nSince starting 1-5, Houston has won three straight \u2014 all on the road, the last two without the benefit of hitting 100 points. And more help appears to be on the way.\n\nOfficially, the Rockets say they are finalizing the details on a deal to bring back defensive guru Jeff Bzdelik. Unofficially, it looks all but done.\n\n\"Just really happy he's coming back,\" coach Mike D'Antoni said before the game. \"It's great. We can pick up where we left off.\"\n\nWhat Bzdelik will find is a team ready and willing to fight hard as it did again Monday.\n\nAfter trailing for most of the second and third quarters, they finally rallied behind Harden in the fourth quarter and closed it out by shutting down the Pacers.\n\nVictor Oladipo finished with 28 points and made two 3s in the final minute to trim the deficit to 94-93 with 24.7 seconds to go, but the Rockets didn't give up another basket as the Pacers' three-game winning streak ended.\n\n\"We still gave ourselves a chance to win, we just came up short,\" Oladipo said. \"The beauty of it is there is another game on Wednesday.\"\n\nThe Rockets have won three straight in the series though this one required everything they could muster.\n\nWhen P.J.

He got a big one to go down Monday night, though.\n\nThe seventh-year swingman hit a 22-footer at the final horn and the Orlando Magic came back from a five-point deficit in the last 24 seconds, taking advantage of a late collapse by Cleveland in a 102-100 victory over the scuffling Cavaliers.\n\nFournier took an inbounds pass with 1.8 seconds left after Nikola Vucevic blocked George Hill's shot at the other end, and the ball went out of bounds off Hill.\n\n\"I finished well shooting the ball, but I missed so many open shots in the first half and third quarter, it's amazing,\" Fournier said. \"I knew (the last shot) wasn't going to be catch-and-shoot situation because that's a tough shot. ...

Desjardins is taking over for the fired John Stevens with hopes of improving the Kings' NHL-worst start to the season. (AP Photo/Greg Beacham) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Willie Desjardins realizes the Los Angeles Kings have more than enough time to turn around their dismal start to the season.\n\nThe interim head coach still wants his Kings to play as if their season and their jobs are on the line in early November.\n\nDesjardins ran an energetic practice Monday to begin his tenure with the Kings, who fired John Stevens and assistant coach Don Nachbaur on Sunday in a shakeup of the struggling club. Desjardins didn't promise any magic solutions to the Kings' woes, but he plans to impress urgency upon his new players.\n\n\"I think the theme we had was that we can't wait,\" Desjardins said. \"You only have so many years that you have a chance to win, and you've got to win now. The easy road would be to say that we can't do it this season. You can't afford to waste a season, because you never know what's going to happen. It's the same with me. I didn't know if I would get another shot at the NHL, so this is my chance. I've got to make it work, and that's the same message to the players.\n\n\"You've got to find a way to make this season work. What exactly it is, we've got to find out.\"\n\nDesjardins didn't land his first NHL head coaching job until he was 57 years old, leading the Vancouver Canucks from 2014-17. After taking the young Canadian national team to Olympic bronze medals last February, he returned home to Medicine Hat, Alberta, and started a hockey school.\n\nGeneral manager Rob Blake abruptly called him last week with the chance to take over the struggling Kings, who haven't returned to the heights they reached during their Stanley Cup championship seasons in 2012 and 2014. Los Angeles still has a wealth of top-end NHL players, including defenseman Drew Doughty, captain Anze Kopitar, forward Jeff Carter and goalie Jonathan Quick, who is injured.\n\nAfter the Canucks fired him, Desjardins didn't want to return to the NHL as an assistant coach. He was thrilled to get another chance to be a head coach with a team possessing as much talent as the Kings \u2014 even if his current contract only lasts until the end of this season.\n\n\"Coming in here, it's a great situation,\" Desjardins said. \"I think there's lots to work with. Sometimes you have situations where you don't have much of a chance to be successful. They've got a lot of good pieces here. There's some really quality people within this team, some high-end guys.\"\n\nThe Kings are in a funk at 4-8-1 heading into their Freeway Faceoff showdown with the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday night. Desjardins said he can't immediately shake up the Kings' playing style, so he will lean on assistant coach Dave Lowry as he attempts to get better results from the same players and largely the same schemes used under Stevens for now.\n\n\"It's hard, because one of the big things you need from players and coaches, you've got to have some trust,\" Desjardins said. \"And trust is gained over time, but we don't have time for that. You've got to trust each other right now. That's harder to do, but we've got to do it.\"\n\nBlake sharply criticized his players' competitiveness and determination while firing Stevens. The veteran Kings didn't disagree with their boss after their first workout under Desjardins.\n\n\"It's rather apparent that you can't be successful in this league, or in life in general, if you don't have the emotion and the passion,\" Kings defenseman Alec Martinez said. \"That's what we've learned this week.\"\n\nCarter was particularly dismayed by the players' role in the departure of Stevens, who also was his coach in Philadelphia before Stevens was fired during the 2008-09 season.\n\n\"I think the world of him,\" Carter said of Stevens. \"A lot of guys in here do. I guess that needs to be a big wakeup call for everybody in this room that we need to get our act together. We haven't played good enough hockey, that's the bottom line. It's compete. It's energy. It's everybody doing their job.\"\n\nDesjardins doesn't expect to fix everything quickly, but he has the winter to work on it. His family is staying in Alberta for now, so Desjardins plans to devote pretty much every waking hour to his work \u2014 and there is plenty to work on.\n\nThe Kings are the NHL's lowest-scoring team with 28 goals in their 13 games, with meager shot creation and an inconsistent power play. They're also not playing up their traditional defensive standards, allowing 45 goals after finishing last season as the NHL's stingiest team.\n\n\"It means we're not getting the job done, and that's the disappointing part,\" Los Angeles defenseman Dion Phaneuf said. \"Ultimately it's on us as players. When a change is made, it's not about the coaching staff. It's about us not getting the job done.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

USA TODAY\n\nDemocracy thrives when more people participate. Florida voters have the power to make that happen.\n\nBooths are set up for early voting in Tampa, Fla. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this year, a federal district court judge ruled that Florida\u2019s current system for determining whether a former felon should regain the right to vote is arbitrary and unconstitutional.\n\nThat unconstitutional system makes Amendment 4, which Floridians will see on their ballots Tuesday, an incredibly important measure. Its passage would restore voting rights to more than 1 million Floridians who have successfully completed prison sentences. Voting rights for former felons, which would not apply to those who have been convicted of murder or sexual offenses, would benefit everyone.\n\nOur democracy thrives when more people participate. When citizens have paid their debts, we should encourage them to work, to pay taxes, to contribute to their communities and, as voters, to fully participate in our democracy. Our society should lift all restrictions, not just voting, that stop those things from becoming reality. Laws restrict felons from getting licenses that allow them to work and from getting housing and educational assistance.\n\nAll three branches of Florida\u2019s government are involved in establishing and enforcing our laws. The state legislature decides what is a crime and the range of appropriate penalties. The police make arrests, and the state attorney\u2019s office, which is part of the executive branch, prosecutes and recommends sentences and other penalties to the judge, who makes the final sentencing decision. Once the time is served, voting should be fully open. That\u2019s only fair.\n\nBut unlike in 46 other states, it doesn\u2019t work that way in Florida. Instead, a returning citizen must wait at least five years to apply for clemency before a board that meets only four times a year. The board can deny clemency for any reason. As Florida's governor has frequently said, there is no standard for giving or denying clemency in his state.\n\nThe Florida Commission on Offender Review has found that the majority of people who regain that eligibility do not reoffend. This means that allowing returning citizens to vote would make our communities safer. It would also boost Florida\u2019s economy by $365 million a year, according to a study by the Washington Economics Group (an economics consulting firm) by reducing the cost of incarceration and increasing the likelihood that returning citizens work and pay taxes.\n\nI became a judge in order to serve the public and to make this state a better place. Until voting rights are restored for returning citizens \u2014 giving them the ability to shape their local communities and have a voice in fights for equal rights \u2014 that safety and fair democracy will remain illusive.\n\nJames E.C.

It turned out, though, that Martinez won\u2019t even finish in the top 3.\n\nThe Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America revealed its award finalists on Monday, and Martinez\u2019s name was a glaring omission. Instead, it was Mookie Betts, Mike Trout and Jose Ramirez leading the AL MVP field. While all three finalists put up a better WAR than Martinez (he was 7th), the Red Sox star certainly deserved to be in the conversation.\n\nMLB fans were shocked about the snub.\n\nMan why can\u2019t we let the players get what they deserve in baseball? JD Martinez not in the final three of league MVP voting is a disgrace to the game!!

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Every year, Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy nips any playoff talk in the bud by saying it's not a topic of conversation until the team wins 10 games.\n\nThe Packers hit the season's midpoint with a 3-4-1 record, meaning there is little margin for error after back-to-back losses to two of the NFL's powerhouses.\n\nTo reach double-digits in victories, the Packers will have to win seven of their final eight games. That quest begins with a return home to face the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.\n\n\"We're focused on winning No. 4. That's all we're talking about right now,\" McCarthy said on Monday, a day after a 31-17 loss to the New England Patriots.\n\n\"We improved as a football team the last two weeks, but you have to play your best football coming down the stretch. We're not playing to the level we need to play in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nIn the final seven minutes of last week's 29-27 loss at the Los Angeles Rams, the Packers failed to extend a 27-26 lead, had a bad punt, gave up the go-ahead field goal and fumbled the ensuing kickoff.\n\nOn the first play of the fourth quarter against the Patriots, the Packers were driving into scoring position when running back Aaron Jones fumbled.\n\nThe Patriots used a pass from receiver Julian Edelman to running back James White to set up the go-ahead touchdown, forced the Packers to punt, then added an insurance touchdown.\n\nNot only did the Packers lose the game, but they lost ground in the NFC North to Chicago (5-3), which routed Buffalo for its second consecutive win, and Minnesota (5-3-1), which beat Detroit for its fourth win in five games.\n\nAfter hosting Miami (5-4), Green Bay goes back on the road to face Seattle (4-4) and Minnesota.\n\n\"The games in November are really where teams historically start to separate one way or the other,\" McCarthy said. \"Our focus is really on our self-scout and things we've been working on. The last two weeks, we're not finishing games.\"\n\nThe problems run across all three phases. Defensively, the Packers have failed to get a takeaway the past two weeks.\n\nOn special teams, there was Ty Montgomery's fumble on the kickoff return against the Rams and two penalties against the Patriots.\n\nOn offense, Green Bay has run a total of 22 plays in the fourth quarter the past two weeks. Against the Patriots, the fourth quarter started with a fumble, continued with a three-and-out and ended with a fourth-down failure.\n\n\"We're not hitting on all cylinders,\" quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. \"We're hurting ourselves with negative-yardage plays and missed throws and turnovers at the wrong time and not being on the same page too many times, whether I'm missing a throw or we're not in the spot I think we're going to be at, it's happening in the worst times. When we have to play our best in those crunch times, we haven't been playing our best.\"\n\nTo get on track, the Packers are going to have to play through some injuries. Right tackle Bryan Bulaga (knee), safety Kentrell Brice (knee), cornerback Kevin King (hamstring) and linebacker Blake Martinez (ankle) were knocked out of the game by injuries.\n\nMartinez, who was injured when he stepped on the ankle of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, returned for the final couple of series.\n\n\"I pride myself on being a tough guy and I didn't want to leave my team,\" Martinez said.\n\n\"I knew if I could run straight and do certain things, I could go out there and finish the game.\"\n\nAccording to McCarthy, King will be \"hard pressed\" to be ready to face the Dolphins. Bulaga, who's suffered major injuries to both knees, avoided a significant injury and could be back for Sunday. Receiver Geronimo Allison might need surgery after suffering a groin injury at Thursday's practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The top 10 questions entering the first full week of the 2018-19 hot stove season:\n\nWho will be the most popular team at the meetings?\n\nStep on down, Diamondbacks. They are telling everyone they will listen to all offers, including for their heart and soul, first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who will be a free agent after the 2019 season. The one they most want to move is ace Greinke, realizing it\u2019s silly to be spending $35 million on a pitcher who eats nearly one-third of their payroll. They\u2019ll have to absorb a portion of the remaining $104.5 million remaining on Greinke\u2019s contract, but they know they need to get rid of the contractual albatross if they really want to rebuild in style.\n\nAre the Chicago Cubs out of the Harper and Machado talks?\n\nThe Cubs, who have reached the postseason four consecutive seasons, tipped their hand when they exercised starter Cole Hamels\u2019 $20 million option. They couldn\u2019t pick it up unless they dealt Drew Smyly and his $7 million contract. The Cubs, with an estimated $205 million in financial commitments in 2019, are focusing instead on the trade market with top trade pieces being outfielder Kyle Schwarber and shortstop Addison Russell.\n\nWill the New York Mets and their new GM spend?\n\nWhile it was assumed all summer that the Mets would dump their prized pitching and reload for the future, Brodie Van Wagenen made their intentions clear. Not only is Jacob deGrom staying, but so is Noah Syndergaard and the rest of the rotation. The way the Mets see it, the NL East is wide open with the Washington Nationals' struggles, and the Philadelphia Phillies perhaps not ready for prime time. They need offensive help, and speed, which makes free agent center fielder A.J. Pollock a fabulous attraction.\n\nAre the Phillies prepared to spend with the big boys?\n\nThe Phillies not only plan to make offers exceeding at least $250 million in the hopes of luring either mega free agent Harper or Machado, but perhaps both. Yes, they have that kind of money. And yes, they are that committed to bringing in a star.\n\nWill Machado's antics in October cost him tens of millions of dollars?\n\nSimply put, no. Oh, sure, Machado would love to take back that quote where he told Fox that he isn\u2019t \u201cJohnny Hustle.\u2019\u2019 And, yes, it was a boneheaded move to kick Milwaukee Brewers first baseman Jesus Aguilar in hopes he would drop the ball. He\u2019ll have acts of defiance when frustrated or angry. Yet, he\u2019s considered a beloved teammate, is a fiery competitor, and, oh, does he have a world of talent. He\u2019ll still get his $300-plus million, and the Yankees, his preferred destination, still are the perfect fit.\n\nFree agents:Ranking the top 57 of the 2018 class\n\nAwards:Our picks for MVP, Cy Young, Rookie and Manager of the Year\n\nGold Gloves:Baseball's best defensive players in 2018 announced\n\nThe Yankees and Dodgers have spent years trying to get below the $197 million luxury tax to reset their penalties at 20% and give them the option of going wild in the free-agent market. So will they?\n\nThe Yankees, who have watched the Red Sox dominate the AL East the last three years, aren\u2019t about to let the opportunity slip by. It\u2019s time to go for the jugular. They want to add at least two starters, and will do everything possible to sign Patrick Corbin -- the ace of the free-agent market -- and perhaps grab Machado, too. Corbin will fit in as their No. 2 starter behind Luis Severino, and Machado can play shortstop until Didi Greorious is healthy, then shift to third while Miguel And\u00fajar slides to the outfield or second.\n\nThe Dodgers, after winning back-to-back pennants and coming up short in the World Series, aren\u2019t expected to be in the market for any of the prized free agents. They signed their man in Clayton Kershaw with a three-year, $93 million extension, and likely will spend their money on relievers, giving closer Kenley Jansen a breather after his postseason struggles.\n\nWill the Red Sox keep spending and keep their free agents?\n\nThere\u2019s certainly no reason for them to stop now, not with this cash cow. The Red Sox had a major-league high payroll of about $240 million, but after winning the World Series, what\u2019s a few million in luxury tax penalties? The Red Sox want to keep on winning, so they are expected to be aggressive in their bids for closer Craig Kimbrel, who produced 108 saves the last three seasons, and World Series hero Nathan Eovaldi. If they don\u2019t come back, the Red Sox certainly will find someone else to take their money.\n\nStory continues below video\n\nCLOSE Thousands flooded the streets of Boston to celebrate the Red Sox World Series win. USA TODAY\n\nWill the White Sox and Reds continue rebuilding?\n\nThe White Sox were embarrassed by last year\u2019s season, believing they would at least be competitive in the lowly AL Central, but they aren\u2019t going to spend $300 million on Machado or Harper believing it would be a magical cure-all. They\u2019re not at the point to spend.\n\nThe Reds, meanwhile, plan to put their money where their mouth is and significantly upgrade their payroll. They badly need pitching and will be aggressive in their bids for Dallas Keuchel and Matt Harvey. Keuchel would be the greatest fit for a young staff with his tremendous leadership skills.\n\nWill the Indians trade one of their All-Star starting pitchers?\n\nYes, indeed, they are open for business, knowing they could trade at least one of their starters - Corey Kluber, Trevor Bauer or Carlos Carrasco - and still run away with the AL Central. They certainly don\u2019t have to make a move, and the price tag will be steep, but if they can make the right trade to bolster their offense while also giving them prospects, they'll do it.\n\nWho could be the sleepers on the free-agent market?\n\nA year ago, Miles Mikolas was the steal of the free-agent market. He signed a two-year, $15.5 million deal with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nWade Miley, who waited all last winter to get an offer until the Brewers finally signed him to a minor-league deal, could be a steal after watching him thrive under pressure in the pennant stretch and October for the Brewers.

(AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions have fallen into last place in the NFC North and there are signs they may have a hard time getting back into the division race.\n\nWhen coach Matt Patricia met with reporters on Monday, he didn't wait for their questions on his team's 24-9 loss to division rival Minnesota.\n\n\"There's a lot of corrections to be made, a lot of things we obviously have got to do better,\" Patricia said in his opening remarks. \"There were some good things on the tape, but just way too many bad things that overshadowed it.\"\n\nThose good moments certainly would have been condensed to tiny snippets. The bad ones were splattered all over the game tape.\n\nOn Monday night, the Lions fired special teams coordinator Joe Marciano.\n\n\"I spoke to Joe and informed him of my decision to relieve him of his responsibilities with our team,\" Patricia said in a statement. \"I appreciate Joe's leadership of our special teams units over the last three and a half seasons and have great respect for his many years of service as a coach in the National Football League. On behalf of our team and the entire coaching staff, I want to personally thank Joe for his commitment to the Detroit Lions and wish him and his family the best moving forward.\"\n\nDetroit's team has been in reverse lately.\n\nThe Vikings (5-3-1) limited Detroit to a season-low 209 yards as the Lions (3-5) lost their second straight. Minnesota's defense sacked Matthew Stafford a franchise-record 10 times.\n\n\"I am embarrassed,\" Lions center Graham Glasgow said. \"It was a bad day for us, and our team. We need learn from this.\"\n\nDetroit was held to single digits in points for the first time since a 17-6 loss to the New York Giants on Dec. 18, 2016. The Lions put together just two drives of more than 30 yards and were 4 for 15 on third downs.\n\n\"What happens is as the season goes on and you have some success in certain areas, teams are going to gear up to try and stop those things that you do, and you're going to have to do it differently,\" Patricia said. \"We've got to be able to handle those changes better than what we're doing right now.\"\n\nAnd on the other side, the Lions have allowed a run play of 40 or more yards in five games this season.\n\n\"We've had weeks where we feel we didn't necessarily perform on the one day of the week where we have to perform well,\" Patricia said.\n\nAs he readies his team for another division road game Sunday at against the NFC North-leading Chicago Bears (5-3), Patricia is convinced that player for player, his team matches up equally with every other team in the division.\n\n\"I think we have a lot of good players on this team, I really do,\" Patricia said.\n\nPatricia said talent isn't the issue bringing down his team.\n\n\"I would say with both offensive and defensive lines, the point of emphasis is fundamentals,\" Patricia said. \"Some of our fundamentals got out of whack. Some of our techniques weren't necessarily where it needs to be on a consistent basis.\n\n\"Fundamentals and execution is what's holding us back now. That's where we've got to start.\"\n\nThe problem he faces is that with the majority of practice time each week dedicated to game-planning, Patricia will be hard-pressed to find time to go back to basics with his team.\n\nAfter a 1-3 start, the Lions won two straight and looked to have righted their season. But these past two losses have them struggling again.\n\n\"As a team, we need to get better,\" receiver Marvin Jones said. \"It is definitely disappointing, but at the same time, we just have to go out there and execute. We cannot shoot ourselves in the foot. I think we definitely did that and we just have to get better.\"\n\nLions offensive lineman Frank Ragnow perhaps summed up the state of the team as they reached the midseason point.\n\n\"If you're not taking a step forward in this league, then you're taking a step back,\" Ragnow said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Brodie Van Wagenen made his first public moves as New York Mets general manager, firing hitting coach Pat Roessler along with bullpen coach Ricky Bones on Monday and announcing manager Mickey Callaway will have a new bench coach.\n\nAfter meeting for two days with Callaway last week, Van Wagenen said bench coach Gary DiSarcina will replace third-base coach Glenn Sherlock, who will shift to first-base coach.\n\nNew York went 77-85 in Callaway's first season as a manager, and Callaway drew attention for game management.\n\nIn a 2-1, 10-inning loss at Cincinnati on May 9, Asdrubal Cabrera and Wilmer Flores batted out of order because the hand-written lineup card given to umpires was different than a computer-printed version posted in the Mets dugout. And on July 9, Callaway brought in left-hander Jerry Blevins against Philadelphia before lefty-hitting Odubel Herrera was announced as a pinch hitter, allowing Phillies manager Gabe Kapler to bat righty-hitting Jesmuel Valentin without wasting a player. Callaway insisted that was the matchup he wanted.\n\nVan Wagenen said the impetus for change started with Callaway's self-evaluation.\n\n\"Having someone that is an experienced coach that can help him with in-game management we thought would be a win for Mickey and help him with his development,\" Van Wagenen said. \"You've got to identify who complements yourself.\"\n\nFormer Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro Jr., who had been first-base coach, will become a front office adviser to the 44-year-old Van Wagenen, who quit as co-head of CAA Baseball's agency group and was hired Oct. 30 to replace Sandy Alderson as GM. Van Wagenen knows Amaro since his own days as a player at Stanford.\n\n\"I think in my transition, he can be a valuable asset for me in the front office,\" Van Wagenen said.\n\nRoessler was promoted to hitting coach from assistant when Kevin Long left for Washington after the 2017 season. Bones had been bullpen coach since the 2012 season.\n\nAlderson's top three assistants have been asked to stay on and are attending this week's GM meetings: assistant general manager John Ricco and special assistants JP Ricciardi and Omar Minaya. Van Wagenen did not specify if all three had decided to stay with the Mets long-term.\n\n\"We've talked to those guys about various different roles and areas of focus and, hopefully, we can get more definition as it goes forward,\" he said. \"But they're certainly important to me and that's why they're out here this week.\"\n\nVan Wagenen attended the Arizona Fall League All-Star Game last weekend, met with player development staff and scouts, and also had dinner with Mets prospect Peter Alonso, who homered in the game on a 103 mph pitch from Toronto's Nate Pearson. The first baseman, who turns 24 next month, hit .314 with 15 homers and 52 RBIs in 65 games this year with Double-A Binghamton, then batted .260 with 21 homers and 67 RBIs in 67 games at Triple-A Las Vegas following a mid-June promotion.\n\n\"He is a really hard worker and he has a burning desire to succeed, and he communicated that very clearly to me, and I told him that we're going to give him every opportunity to try to capitalize on that both in the short term and the long-term,\" Van Wagenen said. \"He will be going to big league camp, and we'll try to get him as many at-bats as we can and see if we can make a decision in terms of how ready he is.\"\n\nVan Wagenen also met with 20-year-old shortstop prospect Andres Gimenez.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Duke Johnson wore a backpack on Monday that seemed symbolic.\n\nThe Browns finally asked him to carry a larger load.\n\nOf the handful of positives to emerge from Sunday's 37-21 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, capping another stormy week of change and uncertainty in Cleveland, Johnson's two-touchdown performance was at the top of the list.\n\nAfter being overlooked \u2014 some would argue misused \u2014 for much of the season, Johnson was the primary focus of the Browns' offensive game plan. He finished with nine catches for 78 yards, added one rush for eight and drew extra attention from Kansas City's defense, which allowed his teammates to make plays.\n\nJohnson was hesitant to say it, but Cleveland's change at offensive coordinator, with running backs coach Freddie Kitchens replacing the fired Todd Haley, made a difference.\n\n\"Um,\" Johnson said sheepishly when asked if the Kitchens-for-Haley swap was the reason for his rise in production. \"I guess you could look at it that way. Again, it's the same plays we've been calling, the same offense. There's just certain things that coach Kitchens likes better than coach Haley did.\"\n\nBefore Sunday, Johnson's season-high was four catches and there were times when he wasn't on the field at all. What made that even more perplexing was that Johnson led the Browns (2-6-1) with 74 catches for 693 yards last season and developed into one of the NFL's best dual-threat backs.\n\nBut with Haley concerned about getting touches for running backs Nick Chubb and Carlos Hyde, who was recently traded to Jacksonville, Johnson became the odd-man out.\n\nA proven playmaker not getting a chance to make plays.\n\nJohnson was targeted by rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield against the Chiefs, and he hopes to get even more opportunities as the season progresses.\n\n\"I think it is possible,\" Johnson said. \"Just going out there and showing what I'm capable of doing, especially showing the reason why I'm here. It was a great showing for myself, but not so much for the team and we're about team here. We should have gotten the win, that's most important.\"\n\nFollowing his first game since being chosen Hue Jackson's interim replacement, defensive coordinator/head coach Gregg Williams said Johnson's breakout was caused by a combination of things, including Kitchens and Mayfield working together for the first time.\n\n\"Freddie did a good job and Baker, too,\" Williams said. \"Baker's understanding of that from the read process \u2014 when a play is called as a quarterback, you don't automatically know it is going to go to that person. There is a read definition that takes you to that person, but from Baker and Freddie, they did a good job with that.\n\n\"It was good to see that with Duke. Just like what we have talked about with other people, I think he can do more and he will. He had a good fire about him, and he will continue to improve too. We need him to improve.\"\n\nGetting Johnson more involved didn't result in a win for the Browns, but it was a small step toward improvement.\n\nCleveland matched a season-low with only four penalties, and Williams, who decided early on he was going to be aggressive, liked that his offense converted three times on fourth down.\n\nThe Browns couldn't keep up with Kansas City's high-speed, high-scoring offense, but Johnson was impressed with the team's character in the aftermath of Jackson and Haley's firings.\n\n\"I never saw them blink,\" he said. \"One, two, scores down or whatever, we were always in a position to continue to fight. I never saw them blink. That is good. That is what we are supposed to do as professionals. Young team, old team, I do not care \u2014 that was good. There was a lot of positive that way. Defensively, we have to play better.\"\n\nAnother bright spot was left tackle Greg Robinson. The 2014 No. 2 overall pick made his first start for Cleveland filling in for Desmond Harrison, who was out with an unspecified illness. Robinson not only protected Mayfield's blind side, but handled all his other duties.\n\n\"He played well, didn't he?\" said Williams, who was on the Rams' staff when they selected Williams. \"I've seen him develop as a young guy. I've seen him have his battles, ups and downs, and it's been good.\"\n\nFollowing the game, Mayfield singled out Robinson, who was grateful for the QB's praise.\n\n\"It felt good to just get out there with the boys, taking it to the game field rather than just practicing,\" said Robinson, signed by the Browns in June. \"It was encouraging and I'm really happy that he spoke well about me.\"\n\nNOTES: Williams did not have updates on rookie CB Denzel Ward (hip), CB E.J. Gaines (concussion) or LB Christian Kirksey (hamstring), all injured Sunday. Williams reiterated his decision to sit DB Damarious Randall (groin) was so he can be healthy for multiple games and not just one.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kathy Willens, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Brian Cashman wants to bring CC Sabathia back for an 11th season with the New York Yankees, and he's also holding out some hope of re-signing J.A. Happ.\n\nEight days after the Boston Red Sox won their fourth World Series title in 15 seasons \u2014 compared to one in that span for New York \u2014 Cashman arrived at the annual general managers' meetings searching for pitching.\n\n\"The Red Sox winning doesn't change the hunger level of trying to deliver a championship sooner than later for our fan base,\" the Yankees GM said Monday. \"I think the hunger and the effort, the passion's there, despite the horrible outcome that took place in the World Series this year.\"\n\nAfter paying luxury tax for 15 straight years, a total of $341 million, the Yankees dropped below the threshold for the first time in 2018, when Boston took over as baseball's biggest spender for the first time since records began in the free-agent era. Cashman is a man with money to spend this offseason.\n\n\"Yeah, we got under the tax, but we're one of the higher payrolls in the game, as you would expect \u2014 and as it should be,\" he said.\n\nCashman made his first move last week, re-signing 35-year-old outfielder Brett Gardner to a $7.5 million, one-year deal after declining his $12.5 million option and paying a $2 million buyout.\n\nNew York finished with a rotation of right-handers Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka and Lance Lynn along with left-handers Sabathia and Happ.\n\nOnly Severino and Tanaka are due back, and Cashman is expected to pursue a group of free-agent pitchers that also include left-handers Patrick Corbin and Dallas Keuchel.\n\nSabathia took a cut in salary from $25 million in 2017 to $10 million this year and went 9-7 with a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts \u2014 missing a $500,000 bonus by two innings when he was ejected in his last regular-season start for hitting Tampa Bay's Jesus Sucre after Rays pitcher Andrew Kittredge threw up-and-in to Austin Romine.\n\nSabathia had surgery on his right knee last month.\n\n\"He's been a great Yankee, and he has time on the clock still,\" Cashman said. \"I think he'd like to stay, and I think we'd like to keep him.\"\n\nHapp, 36, was 7-0 with a 2.69 ERA in 11 starts after the Yankees acquired him from Toronto, but he lost at Boston in the Division Series opener.\n\n\"I would think that there'll be a lot of interest in him,\" Cashman said. \"He has a great reputation throughout the game as a pro, and the performance level was exactly what we needed. So he put himself in a good position as a free agent.\"\n\nCashman already is deep in talks to trade Sonny Gray, just 15-16 since New York acquired him from Oakland in July 2017. Gray, a right-hander who turns 29 this week, was unhappy with the harsh treatment he was given by demanding Yankees fans.\n\n\"The game's evolved to the point where people can see what the real numbers are behind the numbers and the recognition that whoever winds up acquiring Sonny Gray is going to acquire someone that's going to be the player, the pitcher he was more with Oakland,\" Cashman said. \"And so we're very active in those discussions. We're in name exchanges. It will lead us eventually to a conclusion.\"\n\nCashman sidestepped questions about infielder Manny Machado, one of the top two offensive free agents along with Bryce Harper. Because shortstop Didi Gregorius will miss much of next season after surgery to repair a torn elbow ligament, Cashman is examining infield options within and outside.\n\n\"It all depends on the price point,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Chargers have won five straight to improve to 6-2 at midseason for the first time in 12 years. With the next three games against teams with losing records, the one thing coach Anthony Lynn isn't worried about is complacency.\n\n\"This group has an understanding that we start over every week. We refocus and regroup,\" Lynn said Monday. \"We'll go back to work on Wednesday like we hadn't done anything. I like this group's ability to stay in the present.\"\n\nThe Chargers' next three opponents have a combined record of 6-19. Los Angeles travels to Oakland (1-7) on Sunday before hosting Denver (3-6) and Arizona (2-6). After that, the slate gets more challenging with a road game against Pittsburgh, hosting Cincinnati and a Thursday night game at Kansas City, who beat the Chargers in Week 1.\n\nHistory, though, bodes well for teams that get off to fast starts. Of the 124 teams that started 6-2 since the current postseason format started in 1990, only 21 haven't made the playoffs.\n\n\"We have put ourselves in good position to maybe make the tournament at the end of the season but we still have to finish,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn's squad continues to have momentum on both sides of the ball. Running back Melvin Gordon has rushed for 100 yards in three of his last four games with five touchdowns while wide receiver Tyrell Williams has four TDs in the past three games.\n\nOn defense, the Chargers have 14 sacks in their past four games despite defensive end Joey Bosa not playing a down yet this season due to a foot injury. The unit has also come up big in the last two games as it denied Tennessee from making a game-winning, two-point conversion and forced a Russell Wilson incompletion in the end zone on the final play at Seattle.\n\nDefensive end Isaac Rochelle said those plays can be frustrating late in games, but something they need to go through.\n\n\"It is crucial for our defense and our team to be in those situations and deal with it now, especially when you come out with the win,\" he said. \"It says a lot about us. Our defense held up two weeks in a row.\"\n\nAbout the only thing that hasn't gone well is the kicking game. The Chargers released Caleb Sturgis on Monday after he missed two extra points and a field goal against Seattle. The six-year veteran\u2014 who was 9 of 15 this season on extra points and 9 of 13 on field goals \u2014 is the first kicker since the Raiders' Jim Breech in 1979 to miss a PAT and field goal in three straight games.\n\n\"We feel like we gave him a fair shot, stayed with him as long as we could and it came down to performance,\" Lynn said.\n\nMichael Badgley has been promoted from the practice squad. He made all three of his field goals and seven extra points in two games when Sturgis could not play due to a quadriceps injury. The Chargers have been the Bermuda Triangle for kickers as Badgley is the team's sixth placekicker since the start of last season.\n\nLos Angeles lost its first four games to start last season but is 15-5 since, which is the third-best mark in the AFC (New England is 18-3 and Pittsburgh is 15-4-1). Williams said the emphasis since the beginning of the season has been on getting out to a fast start but now they have to sustain it.\n\n\"Going to another tough place and getting a win just keeps adding and building on how we play,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Le'Veon Bell might be ready to head back to work. The Pittsburgh Steelers don't exactly look like they need him.\n\nThe star running back tweeted \"Farewell Miami\" on Monday, possibly indicating the end of his months-long standoff with the club. Bell hasn't been inside the Pittsburgh locker room since last January, opting to stay away rather than sign his one-year franchise tender. The two-time All-Pro has sacrificed half of the $14.4 million he's due this season but needs to report by Nov. 13 to make sure he accrues enough service time to reach free agency in March.\n\nBell's extended absence initially created a furor inside the locker room. Now, it seems almost like an afterthought. The Steelers (5-2-1) have ripped off four straight victories heading into Thursday night's visit from Carolina (6-2), relying heavily on James Conner \u2014 Bell's replacement \u2014 to surge into the lead in the AFC North.\n\nConner topped 100 yards rushing for a fourth straight week during a 23-16 victory over Baltimore on Sunday, and caught his first career touchdown pass when he took a short flip from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and bulled past Baltimore safety Eric Weddle at the pylon.\n\n\"He's showing that no challenge is too big for him, against the No. 1 defense or whoever it might be,\" Steelers left tackle Alejandro Villanueva said of Conner. \"You know when you're so close to him, and he lowers his shoulder, and you see him get a couple yards, it's extremely motivating.\"\n\nConner is second in the league in all-purpose yards and touches behind Los Angeles Rams standout Todd Gurley and tied for fourth in total touchdowns. The second-year back hardly seems bothered by the heavy workload, saying he's built for it. So does his coach.\n\n\"I agree with James,\" Mike Tomlin said Monday when asked about Conner's personal assessment.\n\nTomlin smiled as he answered, mirroring the considerably lighter mood around his team these days. The problems that plagued the Steelers during September have vanished, though Tomlin is reticent to point to any one area where his team has improved.\n\n\"I'm not trying to look for specific areas, I just try to challenge these guys to get better every day,\" Tomlin said. \"That's what we're focused on. I think that if we do that daily that will give us a chance to produce consistent performances that are on the rise. Not only in the second quarter (of the season) but as we continue through this journey.\"\n\nIt's a pattern that's become well established during Tomlin's 12 years on the job. The Steelers have been traditionally slow starters under his watch, then get it together as the days grow shorter.\n\nPittsburgh hasn't allowed more than 21 points during its four-game run and the secondary that was torched regularly in the opening month has settled in. Coty Sensabaugh has taken over for Artie Burns at the cornerback spot opposite Joe Haden and rookie safety Terrell Edmunds has filled in capably while veteran Morgan Burnett heals from a series of injuries that have slowed him since training camp.\n\nThe Steelers aren't exactly overwhelming opponents but considering the firepower on offense, overwhelming teams isn't required. Pittsburgh gave up at least 327 yards in each of its first four games. The Steelers haven't surrendered more than 324 yards over their last four.\n\n\"Our defense is working in the right direction,\" safety Sean Davis said. \"We held the Ravens to 16 points ... and I feel like we're putting together winning performances. As long as the defense continues to do that, and with our offense playing the way they're playing, we're just going to continue riding the roller coaster. Our trajectory is high.\"\n\nConsiderably higher than it appeared while getting repeatedly torched during the opening month. Yet the job is still only halfway done. The schedule remains daunting. If Bell \u2014 whenever he shows up \u2014 can return to at least some semblance of the form that made him an All-Pro last season, Pittsburgh could be a tough out. If he can't, they like their chances anyway.\n\n\"It's still going to be a long ride,\" linebacker Bud Dupree said. \"It was great that we got the win to get on top of the division again. We've got another game against the Bengals. We just need to be sure to dominate everywhere.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The winners will be announced next week.\n\nOhtani figures to be in a tight race with Yankees infielders Miguel Andujar and Gleyber Torres after a historic first season with the Los Angeles Angels. The two-way Japanese sensation was 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA as a starting pitcher before an elbow injury forced him off the mound. He finished out the season exclusively as a designated hitter, hitting .285 with 22 home runs and 61 RBIs.\n\nOhtani is the first player ever to hit 15 home runs and strike out 50 batters in a season, and he joined Babe Ruth as the only players ever to hit 15 homers and pitch 50 innings. He had Tommy John surgery after the season and is not expected to pitch in 2019.\n\nAndujar hit 47 doubles, tied for the second-most by a rookie in major league history, while Torres had 24 homers and 77 RBIs as a 21-year-old. They are the first teammates to finish top three in Rookie of the Year voting since Wil Myers and Chris Archer with Tampa Bay in 2013.\n\nThe World Series champion Boston Red Sox might be in line for more hardware. Mookie Betts is a finalist for AL MVP, and Alex Cora is in the final three for AL Manager of the Year in his first season. Betts led the majors with a .346 average and .640 slugging percentage while setting career highs with 32 homers and a 1.078 OPS.\n\nLos Angeles' Mike Trout and Cleveland's Jose Ramirez are also finalists for AL MVP. Trout has finished in the top two in AL MVP voting in five of the past six seasons after finishing fourth in 2017. Ramirez was third in the voting last year, when Houston's Jose Altuve beat out Yankees slugger Aaron Judge.\n\nMilwaukee's Christian Yelich is the favorite for NL MVP, and Colorado's Nolan Arenado and Chicago's Javier Baez also were revealed as top vote-getters.

(AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Houston Texans have won six straight games for the first time since 2012, leaving their terrible start behind them and putting them firmly in control of the AFC South as they head into their week off.\n\nDespite the dramatic turnaround, coach Bill O'Brien and the Texans (6-3) know that they haven't accomplished anything yet.\n\n\"We've done a great job of coming back from where we were,\" O'Brien said. \"But we've got a long way to go.\"\n\nHouston's latest win came in dramatic fashion on Sunday in Denver when the Broncos missed a field goal as time expired to allow the Texans to hold on for the 19-17 victory to keep their winning streak intact. Now they have two weeks to prepare before a trip to visit the Redskins on Nov. 18.\n\nFour of the team's wins during this streak have come by a touchdown or less, giving the Texans confidence in their ability to win close games.\n\n\"Our first two wins were overtime wins,\" J.J. Watt said. \"When you have to go through those, you learn to never give up hope. You just keep growing one day at a time, one game at a time. It will come.\"\n\nHe agrees with his coach that the Texans can get a lot better and believes this team filled with hard workers will make that happen.\n\n\"It will continue to come,\" Watt said. \"We still have a lot of things to work on. You continue to find a way to win while you work on those things. It is a lot better to work on them while you are winning than losing.\"\n\nThe Texans had a shakeup on offense last week when receiver Will Fuller was lost for the season with a torn knee ligament and they traded with Denver for star receiver Demaryius Thomas to take his place. Thomas had three receptions for 61 yards in his Houston debut, but had a false start, lined up in the wrong spot and looked lost on a drive in the fourth quarter, showing he has plenty of work to do to get up to speed before facing Washington.\n\nO'Brien said his struggles were understandable considering he only had three days of practice to try and learn what he needed to know before Sunday's game.\n\n\"(We're) just continuing to try to coach him up on what we're doing offensively,\" O'Brien said. \"Now, we can kind of take a step back and really go back into what we call the basic information, teach him the formations, teach him the routes, the protections, how the protections fit with the routes that he's running and things like that and the technique of the route.\"\n\nWhile Thomas gets acclimated in Houston, the Texans have been impressed with the development of big rookie tight end Jordan Thomas. The 6-foot-5, 280-pound Thomas, who was a sixth-round pick in this year's draft, has recently emerged as a great goal-line target. He's grabbed three short touchdowns in the past two games, adding another dimension to Houston's red zone offense, which struggled earlier this season.\n\n\"He was a wide receiver and then as he got bigger, (former Mississippi State coach) Danny Mullen moved him closer to the ball and he became a tight end,\" O'Brien said. \"Now, he's had to learn how to block against some of these defensive ends and outside backers and he's gotten better and better at that.\"\n\nThe Texans' big winning streak has coincided with long skids by both the Titans and Jaguars, who both have just three wins. The Jaguars have dropped four straight and the Titans have lost three in a row entering Monday's game against Dallas.\n\nThe Texans think the attitude they showed in getting through their early struggles will help them as they try to add to their streak after the bye.\n\n\"A team with grit, fight, one that can really overcome adversity, play good football in tough situations, take care of the football in critical situations, I think that's the kind of formula that you want to have going down the stretch, hopefully, playing in the playoffs,\" safety Tyrann Mathieu said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Drew wanted a pay raise to finish out the season and got one.\n\nDrew's new deal includes a team option for the 2019-20 season. If the Cavs choose not to retain him, Drew will receive a buyout payment.\n\n\"So now there's clarity,\" Drew said Monday night before the Cavs lost 102-100 in Orlando to fall to 1-9 \u2014 0-5 on the road. \"There's just no gray area, and because there's no gray area and me and my staff can just roll our sleeves up put all into helping this team be successful.\"\n\nDrew said he did not talk to the team about his future after this season.\n\n\"The discussion we had was about moving forward with what we have and what we want to accomplish,\" he said. \"We want to do everything to put (rookie guard) Collin (Sexton) in a position to be successful. We're going to try and move forward and keep this team competitive.\n\n\"I embrace the challenge. My staff embraces the challenge.\"\n\nThe Magic's buzzer-beating win dropped the Cavs to 1-3 under Drew, who didn't want to proceed this season without assurances from the organization. Drew promised to remain professional and do his job during the talks, and the 60-year-old kept his word.\n\nAfter ruling the Eastern Conference the past four seasons with LeBron James, Cleveland is going through a difficult transition without the three-time champion.\n\nAnd beyond the team's rough start, the Cavs are also trying to cope minus All-Star forward Kevin Love, who may be out two months or more following foot surgery last week.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the Cavs have also been dealing with guard J.R. Smith wanting to be traded, Sexton struggling and former assistant Jim Boylan filing an age discrimination lawsuit against the team.\n\nDrew is pleased to have his situation resolved.\n\n\"Obviously we're a different team because of what has transpired within the past 12 months, and then coming into the season, having to lose Kevin Love,\" he said. \"We've got to ask more of our players with Kevin being out, that's the reality, and we're prepared to do that.\n\n\"Now that this is behind us, we can really lock in and focus, and try to continue to teach and get this team moving.\"\n\nGeneral manager Koby Altman is also looking forward to Drew developing a team that entered the season believing it could still compete for the playoffs.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with coach Drew to continue leading the team on the court,\" Altman said. \"He brings important experience and many qualities that we expect to translate well with our team as the head coach.

Dianne Feinstein in January. (Photo: Reed Saxon, AP)\n\nThe Justice Department asked the Supreme Court Monday to consider President Donald Trump's plan to end an Obama administration program that protects undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.\n\nThe request for the high court to intervene in three cases from California, New York and the District of Columbia came even as a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit was expected to render its verdict on the plan soon. Its decision would follow a federal district judge's decision in January that Trump lacked the authority to eliminate the program.\n\nThe high court in February refused to leapfrog that appeals court's review of Judge William Alsup's decision. And the Justice Department acknowledged in Monday's request that the appeals court ruling is likely to come first.\n\nBut the California-based appeals court is more likely to rule against Trump than the more conservative Supreme Court, one factor in the Justice Department's decision to seek the high court's review now. The administration wants to get the case on the justices' docket for the current term, which ends in June.\n\n\"Absent prompt intervention from this court, there is little chance the court would resolve this dispute for at least another year,\" Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in the government's petition.\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, has protected more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants from deportation and enabled them to get work permits.\n\nLast month, frustrated by delays, the department filed notice that it would seek the high court's intervention if the 9th Circuit court did not rule by Oct. 31.\n\n\"The district court\u2019s order requires the government to indefinitely tolerate \u2013 and, indeed, affirmative sanction \u2013 an ongoing violation of federal law being committed by nearly 700,000 aliens pursuant to the DACA policy,\" the Justice Department said.\n\nAdditional challenges to DACA are winding their way through appeals courts in New York and the District of Columbia following district court rulings against Trump's plan to end the program.\n\n\"Those decisions are wrong, and they warrant this court\u2019s immediate review,\" Francisco said Monday.\n\nThe California, New York and D.C. challenges were brought by DACA proponents seeking to block Trump's actions. Sensing that those efforts might succeed, Texas and seven other states filed a separate lawsuit in hopes of having the program declared illegal.\n\nIn Texas, federal district Judge Andrew Hanen, who in 2015 struck down President Barack Obama's effort to extend protection to millions of undocumented parents, surprised immigration experts by refusing to stop the DACA program. He reasoned that while the program for parents never began, hundreds of thousands of their children had relied on DACA for up to six years.\n\n\"Here, the egg has been scrambled,\u201d Hanen said. \u201cTo try to put it back in the shell with only a preliminary injunction record, and perhaps at great risk to many, does not make sense nor serve the best interests of this country.\u201d\n\nThe dispute dates back to Obama's first term, when he established the program without congressional action. The goal was to protect from deportation undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, but many Republicans called it executive overreach and have remained opposed to the program.\n\nTrump vowed to end the program during the 2016 campaign but wavered during his initial months in office. Then last September, he announced that DACA would end six months later unless Congress replaced Obama's executive action with legislation.\n\nSince then, Republicans and Democrats have been unable to compromise. Democrats want the program left alone; Republicans have used it as a bargaining chip to get other immigration enforcement and border security enhancements, including Trump's long-sought wall along the Mexican border.\n\nMore: President Trump may have met his match when it comes to U.S. citizenship: The 14th Amendment\n\nMore: 2020 Census: Supreme Court rules Wilbur Ross does not have to reveal motives for adding citizenship question\n\nMore: Migrant caravan heads towards the United States\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/05/daca-justice-department-asks-supreme-court-consider-ending-program/1836235002/", "Oklahoma State head football coach Mike Gundy reacts to a play in the first second of an NCAA college football game against Baylor, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Waco, Texas. (Jerry Larson/Waco Tribune-Herald via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSTILLWATER, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Mike Gundy is ready to take a fresh approach to Oklahoma State's penalty problem.\n\nThe coach said Monday he will consider benching players for committing bad penalties, an issue that's plagued the inconsistent Cowboys (5-4, 2-4 Big 12) all season and especially in a crushing 35-31 loss to Baylor on Saturday.\n\nOklahoma State had a season-high 12 penalties for 133 yards against the Bears, including three defensive flags in the fourth quarter that allowed Baylor to erase a 31-21 deficit in the final eight minutes. The Bears scored the winning touchdown with seven seconds left.\n\n\"We've had that issue for the majority of the year,\" Gundy said. \"We've had more facemasks, more late hits, more 15-yard penalties, more chop blocks than I've had in years, I would guess.\n\n\"And we're not a good enough team to do that, to get away with that. It has been talked about, it has been preached, literally over 100 times that I've said it over the last three months.\"\n\nOklahoma State has been flagged this season for 68 penalties and 699 yards \u2014 the latter is the ninth most out of 130 FBS schools. The only games this year when they've had fewer than seven flags or 55 yards of penalties were their two signature victories, a 44-21 win over then-No. 17 Boise State (four penalties for 25 yards) and 38-35 over then-No. 6 Texas (four for 52).\n\nThe Cowboys have a shot at another marquee win when they visit No. 6 Oklahoma (8-1, 5-1) on Saturday. They are also one win shy of being bowl eligible for the 13th straight season.\n\nThe most damaging penalties against Baylor were a facemask and a personal foul for shoving the ball carrier once he was already out of bounds.

(AP) \u2014 John Elway says he's going to \"stay the course\" with Denver Broncos head coach Vance Joseph despite his 8-17 record.\n\nElway told Broncos broadcasting partner Orange & Blue 760 that he's encouraged by the team's improvement despite its 3-6 record, which is identical to last year's mark after nine games.\n\n\"At this point in time, we're going to stay the course. I think there's enough good things that are going on as far as us and the way that we're playing,\" Elway said. \"I'm much more encouraged this year than I was last year.\"\n\nA year ago, the Broncos were in the midst of a franchise-worst eight-game skid that included its first shutout in a quarter century and a series of double-digit losses.\n\nThis year, they've hung tough with some of the league's top teams, losing by a combined 16 points to the Texans (6-3), Rams (8-1) and Chiefs (8-1) twice.\n\nBrandon McManus missed a 51-yard field goal attempt as time expired in their crushing 19-17 loss to Houston on Sunday .\n\nAlthough the Broncos have lost six of their last seven, Joseph hasn't lost the locker room.\n\n\"I like the heartbeat of this team and the fact that they're competitors and they continue to work hard,\" Elway said. \"As you know, they're very, very frustrated because they've put in a lot of hard work and they're not getting paid back for all the work they put in with the win.\"\n\nEarlier this season, Elway said it was difficult to make many changes midseason and he reiterated that Monday.\n\n\"You'd love to have the magic wand and throw the fairy dust on this thing and have some good things happen and get us over the hump,\" Elway said. \"We've been in six one-score games, so I'm much more encouraged this year than I was last year because I think that guys are still playing hard and we're in games.\"\n\nElway acknowledged last year that he considered firing Joseph after his 5-11 rookie season\n\nJoseph said this summer that he knew he had to get off to a fast start in 2018 for his job security but in the midst of another trying season, he said Monday his focus is on football, not his employment.\n\n\"That's not my concern right now, my future,\" Joseph said. \"It's about the players and the coaches and winning football games.\"\n\nJoseph has taken heat for his clock management at the end of both halves Sunday, when McManus missed consecutive kicks for the first time in his five-year NFL career, a 62-yarder in the second quarter that led to a field goal by Houston instead and a 51-yarder as time expired that would have given Denver a 20-19 win.\n\nJoseph accepted the blame for the first one, saying he got greedy in going for the long field goal and leaving the Texans enough time to kick their own field goal for a six-point swing at the half.\n\n\"Put that on me,\" Joseph said. \"I was chasing points. That's wrong.\"\n\nJoseph, however, staunchly defended his decision-making on the second one when he decided not to risk Case Keenum getting sacked again after the Broncos had crossed the Houston 35-yard line with about 40 seconds left.\n\nPhillip Lindsay ran up the middle for minus-1 yard and then Denver called timeout with three seconds left.\n\n\"I have no problem with how we handled that situation,\" Joseph said.\n\nHowever, McManus is much more accurate from inside of 50 yards than outside.\n\nHe's 23 of 30 in his career between 40 and 49 yards for a 77 percent clip.\n\nFrom 50-plus yards, he's just 13 of 25 for a 52 percent success rate.\n\n\"Our field-goal line was the 35-yard line. We got to the 33,\" Joseph said. \"So, at that point, yardage-wise we were good. Obviously, with that pass rush, I wasn't going to drop back again and allow (Whitney) Mercilus, (Jadeveon) Clowney and (J.J.) Watt to hit the quarterback and the ball's on the turf and now we lose the game.\n\n\"So, my thought process was we have the yards we need. Let's try to pop a run and get five or six more yards and kick the field goal and win the game. But I wasn't going to expose our quarterback and our O-line to that pass rush one more time and now if they make a play, now we're all idiots, right?\n\n\"It's easy Monday morning to say that wasn't right.

USA TODAY\n\nA week before Guardsman Brent Taylor was killed, he was rejoicing in Afghan elections and thought of you: Our view\n\nArmy Maj. Brent Taylor, 39, a married father of seven and the mayor of North Ogden, Utah, was killed Nov. 3, 2018, in Afghanistan. (Photo: Utah National Guard via AP)\n\nSo many of the airways leading up to Election Day were filled with dark, grainy images of opposing candidates and braying claims of dystopian futures if voters did not act out of fear or hatred.\n\nSuddenly, through the haze of this artless confection, came the terrible and clarifying news that Army Maj. Brent Taylor had been killed in Afghanistan. For a fleeting moment, the nation was reminded once again about the purity of military service and unvarnished sacrifice \u2014 about our better angels.\n\nTaylor, 39, was a husband and father of seven, the Republican mayor of the Utah city of North Ogden, and an officer with the Utah National Guard serving on his fourth combat deployment.\n\nSome Americans might not have even realized that U.S. troops are still in harm's way after 17 years of war in Afghanistan. The number deployed has diminished from more than 100,000 in 2011 to about 14,000 this year.\n\nTaylor had been there since January. When he left to go overseas, hundreds of residents lined the streets of North Ogden to say farewell and police escorted him through town. \"There is a need for my experience and skills to serve in our nation's long-lasting war,\" Taylor wrote on Facebook.\n\nTaylor had joined the military after 9/11, along with all five of his brothers, and served two tours in Iraq and a previous deployment to Afghanistan. On his fourth and final deployment, he was assigned to Kabul as an instructor for new Afghan commandos.\n\nOn Saturday, one of the commandos Taylor was training \u2014 in the kind of insider attack that has claimed other American lives in Afghanistan \u2014 fatally shot the Utah guardsman and wounded another U.S. service member before being killed himself.\n\nThe attack reopens all the lingering questions about America's involvement in Afghanistan, including the trustworthiness of our Afghan allies and the demands of multiple deployments.\n\nFor now, though, it is time to grieve and pay tribute. The commander of Utah's National Guard, Maj. Gen. Jeff Burton, said Taylor \"typified the citizen soldier who ... felt this call to wear a uniform and serve wherever the nation needed him to go.\"\n\nA week before he was killed, Taylor had celebrated how millions of Afghans braved threats to cast ballots in parliamentary elections in October. \"Many American, NATO allies and Afghan troops have died to make moments like this possible,\" he wrote.\n\nHis was a simple calculus: service without fanfare or the promise of enrichment, acting merely out of a sense of duty and a belief in what is right.\n\nIn his last Facebook posting, Taylor urged Americans to do their duty: \"I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote. And that whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us. ... God Bless America.\"\n\nHow best to honor Taylor's selfless legacy?

(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The No. 5 Georgia Bulldogs are firmly focused on a team from Alabama.\n\nNo, not the mighty Crimson Tide.\n\nAfter locking up a spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game for the second year in a row, Georgia briefly celebrated but quickly turned its attention to Saturday night's game against Auburn, the 122nd meeting in the Deep South's oldest rivalry.\n\n\"There's not anybody on our team that's going to be worrying about anything but Auburn,\" coach Kirby Smart said Monday. \"That's the next task at hand. That's what we have to be focused on. Our goal is to play the next team, whoever the next team is, and we try not to have real big highs and no real big lows. We want to stay neutral, right in the middle.\"\n\nThe Bulldogs will get another shot at the team they faced in last year's national championship game. Top-ranked Alabama, which hasn't been seriously challenged this season, locked up the SEC West title with another dominating win, 29-0 over LSU .\n\nBoth Alabama (9-0, 7-0 SEC) and Georgia (8-1, 6-1) are heavily favored to win their remaining regular-season games, which would set them up for de facto playoff game with the SEC title on the line Dec. 1 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta \u2014 the same spot where they played their classic title game almost 10 months ago.\n\nIn that one, the Crimson Tide switched quarterbacks at halftime, overcame a pair of 13-point deficits and pulled out a stunning 26-23 victory in overtime . After Georgia settled for a field goal on its first possession of the extra period, Tua Tagovailoaio threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on second-and-26 to win the game.\n\nWhile the Bulldogs are certainly eager to get another crack at Alabama, no one wants to talk about that matchup.\n\nNot yet, anyway.\n\nClearly, the four players made available to the media on Monday had been coached up to talk only about Auburn (6-3, 3-3).\n\n\"We clinched the East \u2014 that's great. Now it's back to work,\" defensive end Jonathan Ledbetter said. \"We're back to the drawing board getting ready for this week. We're not worried about anything down the line except Auburn.\"\n\nOne reporter pressed defensive back J.R. Reed even more, asking if there was ever a time he \"daydreamed\" about facing Alabama.\n\n\"Do you daydream about Alabama?\" Reed joked.\n\n\"I don't have to play 'em,\" the reporter replied.\n\nReed chuckled.\n\n\"No, I don't daydream about Alabama at all,\" he said. \"Yeah, they're on our schedule now. But we're worried about Auburn.\"\n\nGeorgia locked up the East with an impressive 34-17 victory at No. 12 Kentucky , completing another perfect run through the division side of its schedule.\n\nHo-hum.\n\nThat's merely the first of several items on the Bulldogs' checklist.\n\n\"There was a little celebration,\" Reed said, \"but we know that winning the East doesn't mean that much.\"\n\nGeorgia opened as a 14-point favorite over Auburn, which is coming off one of the better performances of a disappointing season. The Tigers rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to knock off Texas A&M 28-24 \u2014 and an upset of the Bulldogs would really give 2018 a whole new perspective.\n\nThese long-time rivals are certainly familiar with each other. This met twice a year ago, with Auburn romping to a 40-17 victory late in the regular season before Georgia bounced back with a dominating 28-7 triumph in the SEC championship game.\n\n\"You've got two good football teams playing against each other, competing and playing their hearts out,\" Ledbetter said. \"It's a physical game, always. It's one of my favorite games of the season, so I'm looking forward to it. I'm always looking forward to a challenge.\"\n\nAn even bigger challenge is still to come.\n\nBut all that talk about a rematch with Alabama will have to wait.\n\n\"Every week we have to come with the same approach,\" offensive lineman Andrew Thomas said. \"We have to win out the rest of the way to be where we want to be.\"\n\nNotes: Smart gave optimistic updates on a trio of players who left the Kentucky game with injuries. WR Mecole Hardman (ankle) should be able to practice all week and be ready to go against Auburn, while center Lamont Gaillard (hyperextended knee) is also expected to play though he will be limited at the beginning of the week. Freshman offensive lineman Cade Mays (stinger) was restricted to non-contact drills Monday and his status is still to be determined. \"He's a tough kid, and we know he'll push through it,\" Smart said. ...

Leftwich was recently promoted to offensive coordinator, the fifth coordinator that Rosen has had in the past five seasons. (AP Photo/Ralph Freso, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 When the season started for the Arizona Cardinals, Sam Bradford was the quarterback and Mike McCoy was offensive coordinator.\n\nNow both are gone.\n\nOn Saturday, while the team was enjoying a long weekend off, the Cardinals released Bradford, who lost his starting job after three games to rookie Josh Rosen and had been inactive for the last five. Bradford's departure came a little less than two weeks after McCoy was fired and replaced by quarterbacks coach Byron Leftwich.\n\nCoach Steve Wilks said Monday that in releasing Bradford \"we did what we thought was best for the team. We needed that position to be able to add quality depth at different positions.\"\n\nThe Cardinals made several roster moves during their bye week. Last week, they signed tight end John Phillips and offensive lineman Colby Gossett. Gossett was signed off the Minnesota practice squad. On Monday, Arizona signed offensive lineman Zack Golditch from the Indianapolis practice squad. The team also re-signed wide receiver Kendall Wright, who had a 10-day stint with the team in October.\n\nArizona was looking to add depth on the offensive line even though all five starters might be healthy enough to play Sunday at Kansas City. John Wetzel, a backup at both tackle and guard, was placed on injured reserve Saturday with a neck injury.\n\nRight guard Justin Pugh said he is hoping his broken hand will be healed enough for him to play Sunday, which would be four weeks from the day he injured it.\n\nThe Cardinals (2-6) are coming off a come-from-behind win over San Francisco but face a much more daunting challenge against the Chiefs (8-1), who opened as 15-point favorites with the advantage moving to 16 \u00bd points on Monday.\n\n\"Dynamic in every area,\" Wilks said of the Chiefs, \"particularly on the offensive side of the ball. (Patrick) Mahomes is playing outstanding, an MVP-caliber player right now, and all the weapons around him. Again, it's just about trying to eliminate the big plays, and that's what they're known for thus far this year is just creating big plays over the top. We've got to try to eliminate that.\"\n\nIt's the first of several difficult road challenges for Arizona in the second half of the season. The Cardinals also play at Atlanta, Green Bay and the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nArizona's practice Monday was its first since last Tuesday. A workout had been scheduled for last Wednesday but Wilks cancelled it.\n\n\"A lot of injuries, I wanted to be able to give the guys an opportunity to recover,\" he said.\n\nDespite the long weekend, Arizona got an extra day of practice this week. Players have Tuesday off before returning to their regular Wednesday-Thursday-Friday practice schedule.\n\nIt gives Leftwich a little extra time to work on the offense, which slogged through three quarters before Rosen threw two TD passes in the fourth-quarter in the 18-15 win over San Francisco.\n\n\"I think it was very beneficial,\" Wilks said. \"I'm out there, and I'm watching the flow of practice. I'm seeing it in action with Josh and the things that they're doing. Not really to indulge a lot in the game plan, but you can see Byron trying to evolve and move this offense in another direction. I think the bye week was very beneficial to him, as well as to the offense.\"\n\nRookie wide receiver Christian Kirk said Leftwich brings \"a lot of new energy.\"\n\n\"He's such a smart mind and he's just really good at putting his guys in the right position,\" Kirk said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

West Virginia won 42-41. (AP Photo/Michael Thomas) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 The second half of the season has turned sour and painful for No. 15 Texas.\n\nThe Longhorns have lost two in a row after a 6-1 start to fall out of first place in the Big 12. They had to endure a flurry of \"horns down\" signs from West Virginia after giving up the winning touchdown and 2-point conversion with just 16 seconds left on Saturday.\n\nAnd they are back at practice with a growing list of injuries on defense that could be a big factor in Saturday's visit to Texas Tech (5-4, 3-3 Big 12). Coach Tom Herman listed four key defensive players who are out or questionable for a unit that struggled badly in the two losses.\n\n\"We're banged up,\" Herman said Monday.\n\nTexas (6-3, 4-2) didn't list a depth chart and it's easy to see why. Senior defensive end Breckyn Hager (dislocated elbow), senior cornerback Davante Davis (neck sprain) and senior safety Brandon Jones (ankle) all are considered questionable this week. Sophomore Marquez Bimage, who replaced Hager against West Virginia, has a dislocated shoulder and won't play.\n\nHager, Davis and Bimage all left the game in the first half. Jones didn't play at all after hurting himself before the game at the team hotel.\n\nTexas had virtually no pass rush against West Virginia. The Longhorns regularly dropped eight into coverage, and had no sacks or quarterback pressures as defensive end Charles Omenihu couldn't get to quarterback Will Grier by himself without Hager drawing attention on the other side.\n\nThe secondary that was missing Jones and Davis gave up West Virginia touchdown passes of 60, 33 and 18 yards. Texas allowed a 55-yard touchdown run, too, helped by bad tackling angles. The Mountaineers' 2-point conversion came when linebacker Jeffrey McCulloch, who was lined up to help in pass coverage, broke inside when Grier turned to run. Grier easily trotted to the corner while McCulloch was caught up in a wash of blockers.\n\n\"We're playing a bit tentative, for whatever reason is behind it,\" Herman said. \"We haven't cut it loose at times, that's on us to figure out why ... We have to make sure we are playing with a lot more discipline.\"\n\nTexas' three losses this season have come by a total of nine points. The Longhorns also haven't lost three in a row in two seasons so far under Herman. And Texas hasn't lost at Texas Tech since 2008 when Michael Crabtree's touchdown catch with 1 second left ended Texas' unbeaten streak and cost the Longhorns a shot at the Big 12 championship.\n\nAfter losing two in a row, Texas needs help to get to this season's league title game. The Longhorns still have a share of second place and could still get there.\n\n\"I think we've shown progress,\" Herman said. \"I don't think there's anybody who's watched us the last two years, or watched this program the last five or six, that would argue that we (haven't) made substantial progress.\"\n\nA longer losing streak would mar a season that saw Texas rocket back into the top 10 for the first time since 2010. Just two weeks ago, Longhorns dared even to dream about an outside shot at the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"The big picture is irrelevant. We've got to make progress this week,\" Herman said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Jim Vertuno at https://twitter.com/jimvertuno\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Coach Dan Quinn says losing six starters to injured reserve never forced him to lose faith in the Atlanta Falcons, even before three straight wins revived the team's playoff hopes.\n\nThe Falcons (4-4) have recovered from a 1-4 start despite losing both starting safeties, both first-team offensive guards, running back Devonta Freeman and linebacker Deion Jones.\n\nSunday's 38-14 win at NFC East-leading Washington showed the Falcons, who play at Cleveland this week, are back as a playoff contender.\n\nEven after running back Devonta Freeman and right guard Brandon Fusco were the most recent starters to land on IR, Quinn continued to say the Falcons were a team on the rise who had not peaked.\n\n\"All along I've had real belief in what this '18 team can be,\" Quinn said Monday. \"Although it started under some difficult circumstances, I like the way they've supported each other. I like the toughness they've shown and I feel like we're starting to play like we're capable of playing.\"\n\nThe Falcons iced the win over the Redskins by holding the ball for 10 minutes in the fourth quarter, when Washington didn't score. Quinn said the \"ability to finish\" was a highlight of the game.\n\nWith Ben Garland starting for Fusco and Wes Schweitzer continuing in his fill-in starting role for injured left guard Andy Levitre, the new-look offensive line played one of its best games.\n\nThe Falcons converted 10 of 13 third-down plays and scored touchdowns on two of three red-zone possessions. Matt Ryan threw for 350 yards with four touchdowns and one interception \u2014 only his third of the season and his first since a Week 2 win over Carolina.\n\nRyan said the Falcons have improved since losing four of their first five games.\n\n\"I think halfway through we were a better football team than we were at the start, and we have to keep it trending in that direction,\" Ryan said after Sunday's game.\n\nRyan has enjoyed a return to his 2016 form, when he was named the NFL MVP. Led by Ryan, the Falcons have scored touchdowns on 17 of their last 21 red-zone possessions since their opening loss at Philadelphia.\n\n\"I think red zone efficiency has been really good for us,\" Ryan said. \"We didn't do a good job of that in the opener, but since then we've done a pretty good job of that. ... When you're scoring touchdowns and taking care of the ball, that's a good recipe for success.\"\n\nQuinn said seeing Julio Jones finally score his first touchdown of the season \"was probably the coolest part of the day\" in the win over Washington.\n\nJones' teammates rushed down the sideline to celebrate with him following his 35-yard touchdown pass from Ryan.\n\n\"It was a great experience having the team come out there,\" Jones said.\n\nQuinn said Jones \"is the most selfless leader probably that any of us have been around.\"\n\n\"They were so excited for him because of all the work he does behind the scenes that people don't know about,\" Quinn said. \"... They know what he stands for as a teammate.\"\n\nAtlanta's daunting injury outlook could be improving.\n\nThe Falcons already have had defensive tackle Grady Jarrett, who had a sack on Sunday, return after missing two games with an ankle injury.\n\nJones is eligible to come off IR when the Falcons play Dallas on Nov. 18, though there has been no word on when he'll be cleared from his foot injury. It's not known if Freeman will be able to return from his groin injury when eligible in December.\n\nPlacekicker Matt Bryant has missed two games with a hamstring injury.

Alabama won 29-0. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 LSU coach Ed Orgeron proclaimed that Monday was his \"biggest day\" on the job since he took over the Les Miles in 2016.\n\nThe coach expressed concerned about the psyche of his players after the dual blow of losing big at home to No. 1 Alabama and then hearing their own coach say after the game that he needs to bring in better recruits.\n\n\"I told that to my coaches in a staff meeting this morning, 'We are the mature people. We have to bring the players up. I have to be at my best today,'\" Orgeron said. \"There are a lot of hurt people on our football team. We have the 24-hour rule. It may take a little longer to get over this loss.\"\n\nLosses to Alabama tend to be emotional. The Crimson Tide has tormented the Tigers for generations \u2014 first for decades under coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant and now under Nick Saban, a former LSU coach who has won five national championships with the Crimson Tide.\n\nAlabama has won eight straight against the Tigers, starting with a victory in the national championship game at the end of the 2011 season, ruining what would have otherwise been the finest campaign in LSU history.\n\nThe latest loss to Alabama \u2014 by a score of 29-0 \u2014 ended LSU's hopes of reaching the Southeastern Conference championship game and dropped the Tigers from fourth to ninth in the AP Top 25 Poll .\n\nOrgeron was critical of LSU's offensive and defensive linemen immediately after the game, saying essentially that they currently were not good enough to win crucial matchups at the line of scrimmage against Alabama.\n\nOn Monday, Orgeron backed off that assessment to some extent.\n\n\"We must coach better and that starts with me,\" Orgeron said. \"We could've put guys in better position. Our schemes could have been better. We need to execute better. We must be better on the offensive and defensive lines. We must improve our depth and increase the number of quality players there.\"\n\nNo offensive or defensive lineman met with the media Monday. Linebacker Devin White indicated that he would not be bothered by criticism from a coach.\n\n\"When a coach criticizes me, I respect him,\" White said. \"The coach is in a higher authority. He has been around the game. I take (criticism) as a building tool and embrace it.\n\n\"I will tell the coach, 'You say that I didn't do this good. Then, coach me better so I can do those things.' Football is a hard game. If a player is not all about getting better, then he shouldn't play the game.\"\n\nThe Tigers should find themselves in a prestigious New Year's Six Bowl game if they can close the regular season with three victories, starting Saturday at Arkansas.\n\n\"The first thing I am going to tell the players is block out the noise,\" Orgeron said. \"I have a very good relationship with the players. We'll address some things and we'll be fine.\"\n\nUnder Orgeron, the Tigers have never lost back-to-back games. LSU has handily defeated Arkansas the week after a loss to Alabama each of the last two years. The Tigers beat the Razorbacks 38-10 in Fayetteville in 2016 and 33-10 in Baton Rouge in 2017.\n\n\"We're going to prepare the same way this week,\" Orgeron said. \"We have to be mentally tough. We have a lot to play for. We know where we want to go and where we want to finish. We're 7-2 and have a chance at an excellent season. We see that as motivation.\"\n\nLSU may be out of the running for a berth in the College Football Playoffs, but it still controls its destiny as regards getting a spot in a New Year's Six Bowl game. The Tigers should be among the top 11 Power Five conference teams when the CFP standings are announced Tuesday.\n\n\"If we win our next three games, we'll be 10-2,\" quarterback Joe Burrow said. \"If I told you at the start of the season we'd be 10-2, you would have told me that I was crazy. We still have the potential to have a successful season.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Two defensive captains have been cut, a respected veteran retired and the team's No. 1 receiver was traded away.\n\nThe losses for the Oakland Raiders have been mounting on and off the field in recent weeks as a season that began with optimism has fallen apart at the midway point.\n\nAfter four straight losses, including a blowout by Bay Area rival San Francisco, have left the Raiders (1-7) tied for the worst record in the NFL, it's time to start looking to the future.\n\nTo that end, coach Jon Gruden called in his rookie class Friday following the 34-3 loss to the 49ers and delivered a message to the group.\n\n\"He was just telling us he needs more from us rookies,\" defensive end Arden Key said Monday. \"He needs more, more, more. He said we're doing pretty good but he needs more. We need to lead the league in effort and we're not doing that as rookies. ... It was a wake-up call and we answered.\"\n\nLittle has gone right of late for the Raiders, who have been outscored by 85 points during a four-game losing streak. The team has also cut captains Bruce Irvin and Derrick Johnson during that span, watched cornerback Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie retire, and traded receiver Amari Cooper to Dallas for a first-round draft pick.\n\nThat follows the trade one week before the start of the season that dealt star pass rusher Khalil Mack to Chicago for a package of picks, including two first-rounders.\n\nOakland was last in the league with seven sacks before cutting ties with Irvin, who led the team with three. Only rookies Maurice Hurst (two sacks) and Key (one), along with Clinton McDonald (one) have sacks among players on the active roster.\n\nThat's why Gruden wants more from his rookie class that also features defensive tackle P.J. Hall.\n\n\"I know right now the maturity level on this team has to rise up,\" veteran defensive lineman Frostee Rucker said. \"We just have to be a complete team and do the little things better. That's what we're starting with today, trying to do the little things better.\"\n\nThe Raiders also added some reinforcements Monday, signing defensive linemen Jacquies Smith and Kony Ealy to contracts.\n\nEaly had 14 sacks in three seasons with Carolina from 2014-16, including three in a Super Bowl loss to Denver following the 2015 season. He was traded to New England in 2017, got cut by the Patriots and then signed with the New York Jets, where he had one sack in 15 games.\n\nEaly spent training camp in Dallas before getting cut by the Cowboys on Sept. 1.\n\nSmith was originally signed as an undrafted free agent in 2012 and finally got his first chance to play in 2014 with Tampa Bay. He had 13 1/2 sacks in 27 games his first two seasons with the Buccaneers before suffering a major knee injury in 2016.\n\nSmith has played just seven games the past three seasons with Tampa, Detroit and Arizona, recording three tackles and no sacks in seven games. Smith was released by Arizona in September.\n\nSmith worked out for the Raiders in recent weeks and got the call Sunday, a day after Irvin was released. Smith said he feels as healthy as he has since before the injury and is eager for the chance to show what he can do.\n\n\"It's been very frustrating,\" he said. \"Obviously, I have a ton of confidence in myself.

The sophomore ran for 206 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries in Oklahoma's 51-46 win over Texas Tech on Saturday.\n\nIt was the kind of breakout game Sermon has been seeking.\n\n\"He's steady, man,\" quarterback Kyler Murray said after the game. \"He gives us a lot. The combination of him and that offensive line \u2014 you feel like you've always got a chance to get the run game going.\"\n\nSermon had never carried more than 20 times in a game until Saturday night and blew past his previous career-high total of 148 yards rushing.

He's playing well. He's playing better than he did last year, more explosive, more experienced.\"\n\nSermon was Oklahoma's top rusher as a freshman early last season before Anderson took over as the top option.

The U.S. Olympic Committee is moving to revoke USA Gymnastics' status as the governing body for the sport at the Olympic level, meting out the nuclear option to an organization that has botched its own reorganization in the wake of a sex-abuse scandal involving former team doctor Nassar. In an open letter to the gymnastics community Monday, USOC CEO Sarah Hirshland said \"you deserve better,\" and that the challenges facing USA Gymnastics are more than it is capable of overcoming as currently constructed. (Cory Morse/The Grand Rapids Press via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee took steps Monday to decertify USA Gymnastics as the governing body for the sport at the Olympic level, choosing to pursue the nuclear option for an organization that botched its own rebuilding attempt in the wake of a sex-abuse scandal involving former team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nIn an open letter to the gymnastics community, USOC CEO Sarah Hirshland said \"you deserve better,\" and that the challenges facing USA Gymnastics are more than it is capable of overcoming as currently constructed.\n\nThe USOC itself also has faced criticism for not responding quickly and appropriately to sex abuse cases, and though the move was cheered by the gymnast whose own revelations helped propel Nassar's years of abuse to the fore \u2014 \"THANK YOU,\" tweeted Rachel Denhollander \u2014 others viewed it as a ploy to shift blame for the scandal.\n\n\"Today's announcement by USOC seeks only to deflect from their total failure over decades to protect the gymnasts in their care,\" said a statement from attorneys Michelle Simpson Tuegel and Mo Aziz, who represent Olympian Tasha Schwikert and her sister, Jordan, in their lawsuit against USAG and the USOC.\n\nEarlier this year, the USOC said it was seeking to remove itself as a defendant from a number of lawsuits \u2014 including those filed by gold medalists McKayla Maroney, Jordyn Wieber and Aly Raisman \u2014 claiming Nassar never worked for the federation, nor were his crimes foreseeable by the USOC. The lawsuits claim the USOC, as the umbrella organization that oversees USA Gymnastics, should have done more when it learned of the abuse.\n\nIt did push for new leadership at USA Gymnastics, but even with a new board of directors that started in June, the organization made repeated mistakes while dealing with the aftermath of revelations that the now-imprisoned Nassar molested Olympians while working as a volunteer. Those included the botched hiring of a program coordinator and an interim CEO to replace Kerry Perry, who lasted barely nine months on the job after the USOC forced out Steve Penny.\n\nThe announcement comes only days after the U.S. team brought home nine medals from the World Championships in the first major meet in the lead-up to Tokyo in 2020. Five of those were individual medals won by Olympic champion Simone Biles, who is among the athletes who have not hesitated to criticize the organization.\n\nBy moving to decertify USA Gymnastics, the USOC is taking major action against an organization that never grasped control over its own rebuilding. But the move could also leave a void that cannot be easily filled. In addition to supporting elite and Olympic athletes, and selecting teams and coaches for international competitions, USA Gymnastics serves more than 150,000 athletes in 3,000 clubs around the country. There is no other organization standing by to fill that need.\n\n\"Seeking to revoke recognition is not a decision that we have come to easily, but I believe it is the right action,\" Hirshland said. \"In the short-term, we will work to ensure that America's gymnasts have the support necessary to excel on and off the field of play. We are building plans to do just that no matter the outcome of the revocation process.\"\n\nThe federal law that governs the USOC gives the federation final say on which organizations represent each sport at the Olympics, and also establishes a process to decertify the organizations. But that process is used only under the most extreme circumstances. One example came in 1994 when the USOC recommended decertifying the NRA as the governing body for shooting, and the NRA accepted the decision. The USOC also has dictated changes and placed its own administrators in charge of smaller NGBs in need of overhauls. The USOC could take a major role in shaping, even possibly running, whatever agency takes USA Gymnastics' place.\n\nHirshland said she has given USA Gymnastics the option of surrendering its recognition voluntarily, though there was no indication of which direction USAG would go. It issued a statement saying it was looking at the USOC letter \"and is evaluating the best path forward for our athletes, professional members, the organization and staff.\"\n\nThe statement detailed the challenges the new board has faced since taking over in June.\n\nIt is in search of its fourth president and CEO in the last 19 months thanks to a series of resignations, all of them under pressure from the USOC or the gymnastics' community at large.\n\nPenny \u2014 named as a co-defendant in several civil lawsuits filed by former elite gymnasts\u2014 stepped down in March 2017. He was arrested last month and charged with destroying or hiding documents related to Nassar's activities at the Karolyi Ranch, the ex-national training center near Huntsville, Texas, where a number of gymnasts said Nassar abused them.\n\nThe organization named Perry as Penny's replacement but her tenure lasted barely nine months. She was criticized by several high-profile gymnasts, Biles included, for failing to offer a clear vision on the way forward and quit in September.\n\nHer resignation came shortly after the hiring, then quick removal, of Mary Lee Tracy as elite development coordinator; Tracy had been supportive of Nassar when the allegations first surfaced.\n\nUSA Gymnastics brought on former U.S. Representative Mary Bono to serve as interim president and CEO last month. Bono didn't last a week, stepping away after drawing criticism for an Instagram post she made shortly before she was hired that was critical of Nike placing former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick at the forefront of a marketing campaign.\n\nAll these moves simply added fuel to those who were seeking the total dismantling of USAG.\n\nOlympian Jamie Dantzscher, the first gymnast to sue USAG, said she grew tired of USAG's \"cynical PR statements about how much they care about athletes.\"\n\n\"It is time for this organization to be replaced,\" she said. \"My only regret is that it has taken the U.S. Olympic Committee so long to act.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Will Graves contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Customers will now need to accrue $15,000 in \u201celite qualifying dollars\u201d (EQDs) in addition to flying 100,000 elite-qualifying miles (EQMs) to attain that status, which is American\u2019s highest published tier. Currently, customers must fly 100,000 EQMs while earning $12,000 in EQDs. EQDs are essentially determined by a customer\u2019s fare, minus taxes and certain fees.\n\nAmerican did not include changes for its other elite frequent-flyer tiers in Monday's announcement.\n\nThe move brings American in line with changes already put into place at Delta and United for their comparable frequent-flyer tiers.\n\nIn frequent-flyer parlance, EQMs refer to miles that count only toward earning elite status; they are separate from \u201credeemable\" miles that customers collect and apply toward award travel.\n\nAt American, Delta and United, customers earn basic elite status after earning 25,000 EQMs and $3,000 in EQDs in a calendar year. The next levels are earned at 50,000 EQMs/$6,000 EQDs and at 75,000 EQMs/$9,000 in EQDs.\n\nThe highest published levels for the \u201cbig three\u201d carriers now all require flyers to earn $15,000 EQDs in addition to the 100,000 EQMs (125,000 at Delta).\n\nAmerican also detailed several other changes that will affect its elite AAdvantage frequent-flier members.\n\nExecutive Platinum customers who crack the 100,000-mile EQM threshold already earn four \"systemwide upgrades\" (SWUs) that can be applied toward upgrades on any of American\u2019s domestic or international flights. One SWU covers on person traveling one way. Two SWUs would need to be redeemed to cover a round-trip itinerary.\n\nNow, American will give the option for additional SWUs each time a Executive Platinum customer clears EQM thresholds of 150,000, 200,000 and 250,000 miles. Alternatively, a customer can instead request 40,000 redeemable miles -- or the ability to \u201cgift\u201d Gold status (25,000 miles) to a friend or family member -- each time he or she clears the additional thresholds.\n\nAs for the SWUs, they\u2019re especially popular for use on long-haul flights to Asia, Europe, Australia and South America. However, some American customers have grumbled they\u2019re hard to use for confirmed seats and are instead cleared on a standby basis only after a customer gets to the gate on the day of the flight. In other words, that means many frequent-flyers using SWUs for long international flights often don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ll be in business or economy on routes that can top nine hours or more of flying time.\n\nElsewhere, American will change the way customers earn EQMs on certain fares. Fares on four of American\u2019s joint-venture partners \u2013 British Airways, Iberia, Finnair and Japan Airlines \u2013 will now accrue EQMs at the same rate as on American\u2019s own flights. That will result in a higher EQM earning rate on many of those partners\u2019 flights, especially when the fare is booked in a premium cabin or in full-fare economy.\n\nOn the flipside, American is reducing the EQM earning rate on full-fare economy \u201cY\u201d fares from 1.5 EQMs per mile to 1. American said it\u2019s making that change \u201cto ensure that our benefits are aligned with the value of the ticket purchased.\u201d\n\nIN PICTURES: American Airlines honors past with 'heritage plane' paint schemes\n\nAmerican Airlines tails line up at Terminal 3 at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Nov. 11, 2016.

(AP) \u2014 The Chicago Bears are about to find out just where they stand.\n\nThe NFC North leaders are staring at three straight division games after playing four in a row against the AFC East. And they don't need to be reminded how important this upcoming stretch is.\n\n\"We know that going into these division games, it's going to take a whole other level. They know us, we know them. We play them twice,\" linebacker Leonard Floyd said. \"We know now that our level of play is going to have to rise even more.\"\n\nA 41-9 romp at Buffalo on Sunday after beating the New York Jets at home the previous week gave them back-to-back wins over the teams with the two worst records in the AFC East.\n\nBut now, they're staring at the meat of their schedule.\n\nChicago (5-3) hosts Detroit and Minnesota the next two weeks, with the game against the second-place Vikings (5-3-1) on Nov. 18 getting moved to prime time. After that comes a short turnaround before a Thanksgiving matchup on the road against the Lions.\n\n\"It's unique, just like it was playing the four AFC East teams we just played from the same division, but it is what it is,\" coach Matt Nagy said on Monday. \"We put ourselves in a good position, but no one's gonna be looking past Detroit.\"\n\nThe Bears matched their win total from last season as well as their best eight-game start since 2013. They're pushing for their first playoff appearance since the 2010 team lost to Green Bay in the NFC championship game.\n\nBut when it comes to division play, the results in recent years are not good.\n\nChicago has four straight last-place finishes and a 4-21 record against the NFC North since the start of the 2014 season. The Bears also have a 10-game losing streak against the division, their most recent victory coming against Minnesota on Oct. 31, 2016.\n\nTheir only game this year against an NFC North team was the season opener at Green Bay. And that loss was a gut wrencher as the Bears blew a 20-point lead against an injured Aaron Rodgers and lost 24-23.\n\n\"I understand, but that's the thing with us and where we're going \u2014 we try not to get to the past,\" Nagy said. \"We really don't. We're in such a good place right now as an organization. The vibe that we have. We're learning how to win in different ways. We've learned what losing's about and how you respond from that. But we're trying to really create our own culture and create our own history.\"\n\nIn his first season as a head coach, Nagy has the Bears positioning themselves for the postseason. But he insisted he does not use that possibility to motivate the team.\n\n\"We worry about playoffs, then we're worrying about the wrong thing,\" Nagy said. \"We have a lot of season left.\"\n\nGetting star pass rusher Khalil Mack (ankle) and No. 1 receiver Allen Robinson (groin) back could help. Both players have missed the past two games, with Nagy saying they remain day to day. If they do play, the question is how healthy and effective they will be.\n\nTheir status could become clearer once the team returns to practice. Both players sat out on Wednesday and Thursday the past two weeks before participating on a limited basis Friday and ultimately being held out of the games.\n\nThe Bears were able to beat two struggling teams without them. But the schedule is taking a tougher turn.\n\n\"You know all we have to do is win,\" tight end Trey Burton said. \"Don't listen to what the guys are saying on the outside and focus on what we're doing on the inside.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/tag/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jay LaPrete) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Its goal of a winning season long gone, Nebraska is shifting some attention to Devine Ozigbo and a couple of his teammates' pursuits of individual milestones.\n\nOzigbo needs 204 yards over the final three games to become the Cornhuskers' first 1,000-yard rusher since Ameer Abdullah in 2014. Since 1971, the Huskers have never gone four straight years without a player making it to 1,000.\n\n\"It kind of came up as the season went along, that I was getting close,\" Ozigbo said Monday. \"Now it's something I definitely want to go out and grab for a personal goal. I definitely want to do it for the team and for the fans. It's something they've been talking about for a few years now, and it would be good to give it to them.\"\n\nReceivers JD Spielman and Stanley Morgan each are within striking distance of becoming the school's first 1,000-yard receiver. Spielman has 59 catches for 747 yards and Morgan has 51 for 725.\n\nThe Huskers (2-7, 1-5 Big Ten) begin the last quarter of their season Saturday at home against Illinois (4-5, 2-4).\n\n\"Our first goal, obviously, is to win games, and we'll do whatever we have to do on offense to win games,\" coach Scott Frost said. \"But I'd love to see Devine get to 1,000 and love to see Stanley and JD get to 1,000. I was just made aware of their numbers today, because I don't really look at that. I think it's possible for all of them to do it if we play well on defense, and if those guys hit those benchmarks that means we probably put ourselves in position to win games.\"\n\nSpielman and Morgan went into the season already known as a couple of the Big Ten's best receivers. That Ozigbo is in position to add his name to Nebraska's distinguished list of 1,000-yard rushers would have seemed unlikely two months ago.\n\nOzigbo had never run for 500 yards any of his first three years in the program, and he wasn't a full-fledged starter until the fourth game this season. He went into September listed as the No. 3 running back behind Greg Bell, who has since transferred, and freshman Maurice Washington.\n\n\"Coming into this year, I definitely knew that it might not be all I wanted, because we have so many talented guys here,\" Ozigbo said. \"I knew I was going to be in a limited role, but I was going to try to make the most out of it.\"\n\nOzigbo ran for 170 yards and two touchdowns against Purdue on Sept. 29, and after he went for 152 yards and two TDs against Minnesota on Oct. 20 , Frost said Ozigbo showed NFL potential.\n\nThe difference between the Ozigbo of 2017 and 2018 is apparent. The 6-foot, 235-pounder is stronger, moving the pile forward on a number of runs, and he's able to reach his top speed faster. He said credit goes to arduous strength and conditioning drills in the offseason and an overhauled nutrition program, both of which helped him reduce his body fat from 16 percent to 12 percent.\n\n\"You can tell that he's driven, he really has fallen in love with the way we do things here and he's taken it upon himself to get that extra yard,\" offensive lineman Jerald Foster said.\n\nOzigbo originally made a verbal commitment to Iowa State, but he was wooed away when Nebraska's interim staff started showing interest in him during the period between Bo Pelini's firing and Mike Riley's hiring in December 2014.\n\nOzigbo is from Sachse, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and he was well aware of the accomplishments of Rex Burkhead, who's from nearby Plano. Burkhead ran for 1,357 yards and 15 TDs in 2011 before his injury-plagued senior season.\n\nIf Ozigbo hits 1,000, he will join Burkhead and 21 other Nebraska players who have accomplished the feat.\n\n\"I knew in the past they always had a high-caliber group of running backs that came through,\" Ozigbo said. \"Seeing what he did here, I liked that. He's from my area. He plays good ball. They treated him well. I can do something like that.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

During the ordeal, police say Bowers was spewing anti-Semitic slurs in the biggest attack on Jewish people ever on U.S. soil.\n\nBowers was heard expressing his desire to kill Jews even as he arrived at the hospital, but Mahler said in a Facebook post he felt a duty to treat him like any other patient.\n\n\u201cI wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy,\u2019\u2019 Mahler wrote. \u201cI felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong. ... Love. That\u2019s why I did it.

It reaffirms why we\u2019re all here.\u2019\u2019\n\nMahler said he often endured anti-Semitism and harassment as a kid, especially being the son of a rabbi, and he has downplayed his religion as an adult. He didn\u2019t reveal it to Bowers, who in the past has posted venomous anti-Semitic messages on social media.\n\nHowever, Mahler said that\u2019s not the person he saw at the emergency room, even though Bowers\u2019 alleged attack had the nurse worried that his own parents could have been among the victims.\n\n\u201cI didn't see evil when I looked into Robert Bower's eyes.

Rookie quarterback Allen has resumed practicing for the first time since spraining his right throwing elbow, though coach Sean McDermott says it is too early to determine whether he can play against the New York Jets this weekend. (AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 The Buffalo Bills might have some good news on offense, for once.\n\nRookie quarterback Josh Allen resumed throwing for the first time in three weeks since spraining his right elbow, and there's a possibility he could play against the New York Jets this weekend.\n\nCoach Sean McDermott wouldn't rule out Allen from playing Sunday, but was cautious in adding, \"I'm going to take it day to day at this point.\"\n\nAllen began testing his arm on Friday, and continued through the weekend, McDermott said. On Monday, Allen threw about 100 passes during a workout, which translates into an average workload during a normal practice.\n\nMcDermott stressed he's going to take a cautious approach regarding Allen, and noted one option is providing him additional time to heal with Buffalo (2-7) entering its bye week after playing at New York.\n\nShould he play, the matchup against the Jets (3-6) would pit the Bills rookie against quarterback Sam Darnold, who was drafted third overall, four spots ahead of Allen.\n\nAllen has been out since being hurt during a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14, which began the Bills' four-game skid.\n\nBuffalo's quarterback position has been in flux since and contributed to a sputtering offense which has scored 20 points in its past three games and an NFL-worst 96 overall this season.\n\nDerek Anderson turned the ball over six times in two starts before sustaining a concussion in a 25-6 loss to New England last week. Nathan Peterman threw three interceptions in a 41-9 loss to Chicago on Sunday.\n\nAnderson remains in the NFL's concussion protocol.\n\nShould Allen not be ready, McDermott said Anderson would be the next in line to start if he's cleared to play.\n\nIn updating other injuries, McDermott said running back Chris Ivory has been released from the hospital after being evaluated for what he called \"internal issues\" separate from a shoulder injury he sustained against Chicago. Ivory is considered day to day.\n\nStarting tight end Charles Clay is listed week to week after hurting his hamstring on Sunday.\n\nAllen's pending return is an encouraging sign for an offense that's been anemic no matter who's behind center. The 22-year-old has a 2-3 record since taking over the job in Week 2, and lost plenty of developmental opportunities while being sidelined.\n\n\"It's never easy for a young player to miss reps, valuable reps. But it's offered a nice perspective in kind of a glass-half-full in terms of his development,\" McDermott said. \"He's had a chance to watch, take a step back and learn while being on the sideline.\"\n\nIt couldn't have been easy watching.\n\nBuffalo has scored just two touchdowns in its past five games, and Peterman's 1-yard run against Chicago ended a TD drought that spanned 187 minutes and 19 seconds. With just eight touchdowns all season, the Bills are one of just 13 teams since 1940 with that many or fewer through nine games, according to Pro Football Reference.\n\n\"To get the results we've gotten on that side of the ball in particular leaves you frustrated, leaves you empty-handed,\" McDermott said. \"Our fan base deserves better. That's what we're committed to do. That's what I came here to do, and to do it the right way. It takes some time.\"\n\nAnd, though McDermott won't acknowledge it publicly, it'll take more talent.\n\nBuffalo's offensive line is a patchwork unit that lost two starters \u2014 center Eric Wood and guard Richie Incognito \u2014 this offseason.\n\nProtection is an issue. Buffalo's 33 sacks are the second-most allowed in the NFL.\n\nAnd the running attack has ground to a halt with LeSean McCoy having combined for 23 yards on 22 carries over the past two games.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do, a lot of getting better to do. Not where we need to be,\" offensive coordinator Brian Daboll said.\n\nThe Bills claimed receiver Isaiah McKenzie on Monday, three days after he was placed on waivers by Denver. He was used mostly as a kickoff and punt returner in 12 career games, including one this season, since being selected in the fifth round of the 2017 draft out of Georgia.\n\nBuffalo created a roster spot by releasing receiver Cam Phillips.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor and a physician at Michigan State University, is serving an effective life sentence after pleading guilty to federal child pornography charges and state charges of sexual abuse.\n\nAmong the more than 350 women who said Nassar abused them are Olympic gold medalists Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Jordyn Wieber, Kyla Ross and Madison Kocian.\n\nUSA Gymnastics released a statement Monday noting its board was seated in June and \"inherited an organization in crisis.\" The board has taken steps to change the leadership and is conducting a search for a CEO \"who can rebuild the organization and, most importantly, regain the trust of the gymnastics community,\" the statement read.\n\nTwo-time Olympic medalist Jonathan Horton tweeted he was glad the USOC decided to act. \"Now, we can really come together as a community and make this sport the way we want it. This is a great move forward!\" Horton tweeted.\n\nThe USOC's action Monday triggers a process that includes a hearing before a three-person panel. The USOC will select the panel, which will be chaired by a USOC board member and include a representative from the NGB council and athlete advisory council. USA Gymnastics will have the opportunity to \"present factual evidence and legal argument regarding the allegations of the complaint\" at the hearing, according to the USOC bylaws.\n\nAfterward, the hearing panel will issue a report to the USOC board with a recommendation on what action should be taken. Hirshland can also submit a report to the board. After considering the reports and recommendations it receives, the USOC board will issue a final decision.\n\nThe USOC's bylaws do not outline any sort of timeline for the process.\n\nThe USOC is known to have revoked the recognition or cut off the funding of an NGB only three times \u2014 with taekwondo, team handball and modern pentathlon.\n\nIn January, the USOC wrote to USA Gymnastics to set forth requirements for changes it would need to make or risk losing its recognition as the NGB for the sport.\n\nAmong them was removal of the entire USA Gymnastics board, which the organization complied with, as well as cooperation with an investigation by Ropes & Gray. The Boston-based law firm is looking into whether anyone at USA Gymnastics knew about athlete complaints of Nassar\u2019s abuse and didn\u2019t report them, as well as systemic failures that might have contributed to him going unchecked for so long.\n\nDespite those guidelines from the USOC, USA Gymnastics has had repeated missteps since.\n\nIn August, USA Gymnastics hired Mary Lee Tracy as its elite development coordinator even though she publicly defended Nassar after more than 50 women had come forward to allege being abused by him. Three days after that announcement, the organization asked Tracy to resign after she contacted Raisman.\n\nDays later, Kerry Perry was forced out as CEO after Hirshland issued a statement saying it was \u201ctime to consider making adjustments in the leadership.\u201d\n\nDuring Perry\u2019s tenure with the organization, USA Gymnastics lost all of its key sponsors, and its national championships in August were held without a title sponsor, almost unheard of for one of the marquee Olympic sports in the United States.\n\nFormer Congresswoman Mary Bono resigned as interim CEO and president of USA Gymnastics on Oct. 16, 2018. (Photo: Stephen J Boitano, Gannett)\n\nLast month, USA Gymnastics announced the hiring of Bono, a former Congresswoman, as its interim CEO. But Bono resigned five days later in the wake of heavy criticism in tweets from Biles and other gymnasts questioning whether Bono was fit to lead and what message her hiring sent to the women abused by Nassar.\n\nBiles, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, was critical of a tweet from Bono that included a photo of Bono blacking out the Nike logo on her golf shoes, which appeared to be a criticism of Nike\u2019s endorsement deal with Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBono previously worked at the law firm Faegre Baker Daniels. The Indianapolis Star reported that the firm worked with USA Gymnastics officials to provide \u201cfalse excuses\u201d for Nassar\u2019s absence from major gymnastics events in 2015 rather than disclose to parents and gymnasts that he was under investigation for child sexual abuse.\n\nBono was not affiliated with the Faegre Baker Daniels office that worked with USA Gymnastics or the law practice. She had worked on legislative strategies and policies for Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting.\n\nThe USOC previously pushed for the ouster of former CEO Steve Penny, who left the organization in March 2017 in the wake of the Nassar scandal.\n\nPenny was indicted in Walker County, Texas, in September on a count of tampering with evidence, a third-degree felony, and arrested in Tennessee last month. He has plead not guilty.\n\nIn Congressional testimony, Rhonda Faehn, the former head of the women\u2019s program, said Penny ordered the removal of documents from the Karolyi Ranch.\n\nDespite the changes to its leadership, USA Gymnastics continues to employ Ron Galimore as its chief operating officer.\n\nGalimore is the only person left at USA Gymnastics of six who received an email from Penny on July 21, 2015, \u201cbecause you are among those that are aware of the current issue concerning USA Gymnastics and one of our medical staff.\u201d\n\nIn May, IndyStar, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported that Galimore was involved in coordinated efforts by Nassar and USA Gymnastics to conceal his dismissal by the federation. In the emails obtained by IndyStar, Faegre Baker Daniels attorney Scott D. Himsel told Nassar that Galimore would explain Nassar\u2019s absences for the U.S. Classic and national championships to the medical staff, using their agreed-upon stories.", "Fulham's Andre Schurrle shoots wide during their English Premier League soccer match against Huddersfield Town at The John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield, England, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Jeff Brohm turned around Purdue's season with a style change.\n\nAfter starting 0-3, Purdue finds itself one win from becoming bowl eligible, one game behind Northwestern in the Big Ten West Division and perhaps one week away from knowing whether a division crown remains a possibility.\n\n\"Going back to those other three games, I think they had it in them,\" Brohm said following Saturday's upset of No. 19 Iowa. \"But they had a head coach that wasn't as aggressive as he is now.\"\n\nBrohm has long believed the path to victory in college football comes by staying on the attack. But after losing twice in part because of late personal foul calls against his defense and a third time after a replay review overturned a go-ahead touchdown, Brohm decided his team wasn't going down without a fight.\n\nThe Boilermakers (5-4, 4-2) won five of their next six by routinely throwing deep and using a full gamut of trick plays \u2014 everything from the quarterback touchdown reception to the daring first-down run from punter Joe Schopper on a fake field goal in the upset of Ohio State.\n\nBrohm acknowledges his stint as a quarterback in the XFL taught him serious players could still have fun playing the game, a lesson he puts to use seemingly every week.\n\n\"If you want to be a contender in the conference, you've got to win, and if you don't, you're out,\" Brohm said Monday. \"That kind of happened to us at the end of last year and we kind of had something similar where we knew our backs were against the wall and we had to win to advance. In our mind, we have to win to advance and stay a contender.\"\n\nIt's a big reason Brohm appears to be headed toward a fifth straight bowl game as a head coach and perhaps a conference championship game appearance. A win at Minnesota on Saturday and a home win over Wisconsin would put Purdue in the mix \u2014 if Iowa beats Northwestern at home this weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indiana Hoosiers are staring at an all-too-familiar fate.\n\nComing off of their bye week, the winding road to the postseason is full of challenges after starting 4-1.They've lost four straight and need to win two of their last three just to become eligible for their third bowl bid in four years.\n\nBut even if they beat Maryland at home Saturday, they still need to beat either No. 4 Michigan or the rival Boilermakers at home. Indiana hasn't won in Ann Arbor since 1967 though it will get the Wolverines the week before they face Ohio State. The Hoosiers have beaten Purdue in four of the last five meetings.\n\nLike the Boilermakers, the Hoosiers have remained competitive against some of the Big Ten's top teams.\n\nUnlike Purdue, though, Indiana has struggled to close out games. The difference has put their postseason hopes in peril.\n\n\"For me, it's continuing to keep our guys locked in, keeping where they need to be mentally, which I feel we have some strong leadership that has helped with that,\" coach Tom Allen said Monday. \"The bottom line is it's about us finishing in key situations.\"\n\nOne possible solution: Stealing a fashion tip from Brohm.\n\n\"We started 0-3 and lost to some teams maybe we shouldn't have lost to,\" Brohm said. \"We weren't aggressive in our approach. We didn't go for the win. We played not to lose at times. We made critical mistakes that hurt us.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

After 2018, he will have to start every game for the next five-plus seasons to catch Favre\u2019s mark of 297 consecutive.\n\nDue to extra teams off this past weekend, the statistical takeaways were few and far between.\n\nFigures\n\n18: The number of targets for Tampa Bay Buccaneers wideout Adam Humphries in the last two games. The results: 15 grabs, 158 yards and two touchdowns \u2014 both of which came in Week 9. The upcoming schedule is favorable, including Washington, the New York Giants, San Francisco, Carolina again and New Orleans over the next five weeks. With such a miserable defense and no consistent running game ailing the Bucs, it translates into a pass-heavy recipe on offense. He saw 82 percent of the offensive snaps, compared to 48 for DeSean Jackson and 55 for Chris Godwin. Humphries is a fine weekly flex in PPR.\n\n11 targets: It is no surprise the week Demaryius Thomas is traded away, Denver Broncos TE Jeff Heuerman sees a league-high 11 looks at his position for the week. The 6-foot-5, 254-pounder has tremendous size to offer in the red zone, and he has displayed the ability to stretch the field prior to 2018. He is far more athletic than his 8.7 yards-per-reception average this season indicates. Given the dearth of fantasy weaponry at the position, consider Heuerman a reasonable play most weeks. The three games after Denver\u2019s Week 10 bye couldn\u2019t be much better for fantasy success at the position. He is even worth rostering through the bye week, provided it doesn\u2019t come at great sacrifice elsewhere.\n\nCurtis Samuel covered a total of 103.8 yards on his 33-yard double-reverse TD run against the Buccaneers in the 2nd quarter.

A threat in the red zone for Carolina on the ground and through the air, the second-year, do-all weapon is a fantasy consideration for owners trying to maneuver bye weeks. Let\u2019s face it, if you\u2019re in the boat where a low-volume guy is in play for your lineup, at least give yourself a stronger shot at finding the end zone.\n\nThestory is a fun one, especially for a city in dire need of some good news from its football team, but the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 hidden gem beat up the Oakland Raiders. Let\u2019s not act like he shredded a premier defense. Oakland has demonstrated virtually zero ability to get to the quarterback and apply pressure, let alone actually log sacks. He is expected to draw another start and has the luxury of facing the New York Giants, the next clostest ineptitude team at recording sacks. Then there\u2019s a bye week and a return to face Tampa Bay \u2026 Mullens will artificially become a \u201cthing\u201d in the NFL before being returned to reality with matchups against Seattle, Denver, Seattle again and then Chicago. If he survives that murderers\u2019 row and continues to look the part, I\u2019ll eat my keyboard.\n\nGreen Bay rates among the stiffest defenses against the tight end position, and it is difficult to get behind this ranking. None of the players faced managed to find the end zone vs. the Packers this year, but a loser look at the opponents leaves serious room for doubt. The only impressive performance has been the Week 6 job at limiting George Kittle to a 4-30-0 line. Otherwise, we\u2019ve seen Green Bay take care of business against laughable tight end situations in Buffalo, Detroit, New England minus Gronk, and the Los Angeles Rams. The Redskins managed 135 yards on six catches, and Kyle Rudolph posted a 7-72-0 line in Week 2. Chicago\u2019s offense was still finding its way in the season opener. Ahead: Miami, Seattle, Minnesota, Arizona, Atlanta, Chicago, the New York Jets and Detroit \u2026 hardly powerhouses at the position. Furthermore, the loss of Ha Ha Clinton-Dix on the backend will be felt, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before one of these subpar tight ends exploits the Packers.\n\nFeelings\n\nIt was a delight to seelooking healthy and more like himself in Week 9. The Vikings enter their bye week and should be encouraged after a convincing divisional win in which their prized running back ripped off a 70-yard run. After the Week 10 vacation, which will only help Cook\u2019s health, Minnesota returns for a stiff stretch at Chicago, vs. Green Bay, at New England and at Seattle in Week 14. Be cautiously optimistic.\n\nIt really baffles me why Denver doesn\u2019t target Phillip Lindsay more in the receiving game. He is so dynamic in the open field, and even if his hands are only marginal, this offense could use more explosive plays by any means it can find them. After they upcoming bye, two of the next three opponents have struggled to contain pass-catching running backs, so I\u2019m eagerly waiting to see how he is deployed in Week 11 vs. the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe Washington Redskins were smothered by a paltry Atlanta Falcons defense in Week 9, mostly due to a rash of offensive line injuries. Both offensive tackles and guards were not in the lineup by the end of the game. With left tackle Trent Williams already out for roughly a month, now right guard Brandon Scherff and been lost for the rest of the year. The same for left guard Shawn Lauvao. The strength of this team\u2019s offense, especially the running game, comes from the front five. Looking ahead, I\u2019m skeptical ofwith any matchup. He has the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next, and after being unable to exploit Atlanta in Week 9, there is little reason to believe he can escape crowded backfields against Gerald McCoy and Co. Even without the decimated offensive line being problematic, Washington faces the ninth-hardest remaining schedule for running backs in fantasy.

(AP Photo/Larry Papke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 NASCAR did not have its finest day at Texas Motor Speedway, where things first went awry with an erroneous penalty even before the race.\n\nKevin Harvick won and advanced to the championship round for the fourth time in five years. His victory wasn't all that surprising because the 2014 champion had said for months he was most looking forward to Texas because he believed it would be his winning ticket into the final four.\n\nThe drama instead came from NASCAR officiating, one playoff driver complaining that another raced him too hard and another snoozer of a race.\n\nJimmie Johnson was incorrectly sent to the back of the field moments before the race began. Officials in NASCAR's scoring tower punished Johnson's team for failing pre-race inspection three times. The problem? His car had only failed inspection two times, so the penalty was incorrect.\n\nNASCAR admitted the error during Sunday's race but it was too late to remedy. Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR's chief racing development officer, didn't hide from the error after the event and promised steps would be taken to prevent such a blunder moving forward. O'Donnell called the mistake \"unacceptable\" and promised system upgrades before this weekend's penultimate race of the season at Phoenix.\n\n\"It was one of those things, again, a human error that we've really got to look at and look at some additional procedures we can have in place prior to Phoenix,\" O'Donnell said Monday on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio. \"We'll have those done (Monday), and we'll be communicating those first and foremast to the team that was affected and then to the industry as well.\"\n\nJohnson, the seven-time NASCAR champion, has already been eliminated from this year's playoffs. But he's winless this season, just signed a new sponsor and went to Texas with just three races remaining with Chad Knaus, the crew chief who built his team in 2001. An erroneous penalty issued after he was already in his car set the tone for a rotten day that can't be corrected.\n\nO'Donnell was also asked to explain a penalty on Clint Bowyer, who is still in the playoffs and whose team was flagged for a crew member being over the wall during a pit stop. Except the crew member in question was actually sitting on the pit road wall, though the penalty was correct because his feet were resting on the ground. Yes, a rule was broken. But it was a call that left some wondering if NASCAR has gotten too heavy-handed in enforcing a cumbersome and confusing rulebook.\n\n\"That's the rule. I know people don't necessarily like all the rules, but that's the rule,\" O'Donnell said. \"If we don't make that call, I think (media) would be asking why we didn't.\"\n\nHad the racing been more interesting the Johnson gaffe might have become just a footnote. But the ticky-tack call on Bowyer's team on top of it only gave fans more reason to complain. NASCAR's on-track product has greatly deteriorated through evolving rules packages, and even O'Donnell had to admit that the entertainment was far superior in Friday night's Truck Series race, and again in the Xfinity Series race on Saturday, to what fans got to see Sunday in the main event.\n\nNASCAR is hoping its 2019 rules package is a move toward more action.\n\nTexas Motor Speedway President Eddie Gossage also said the repaved Texas asphalt needs more weathering to improve the racing, which had only one real nugget of interest on the track all day: Aric Almirola took exception to Joey Logano racing him hard in the final stage. Logano already has a slot in the final four and Almirola believed Logano could have backed off a bit.\n\n\"If that is the way he wants to race me when he is already locked into Homestead and we are out here fighting for our lives, that is fine,\" Almirola said. \"When Homestead comes around if I am not in, he will know it.\"\n\nAlmirola's anger was at least interesting \u2014 even if his is a misguided belief that Logano should go easy on drivers still chasing the remaining two spots in the season finale.\n\nTexas was not a good race for NASCAR from start to finish. There are only two races remaining before a much-needed break and NASCAR hits a reset for 2019. The bad news is those races have a championship at stake and are two more opportunities for NASCAR to have rotten days.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDino Babers sure didn't want his third year at Syracuse to turn out like the first two, so he's adjusted his routines. So far, the move has paid off.\n\nThe surprising Orange (7-2, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 19 CFP), fresh from a road victory over Wake Forest on Saturday , moved up nine spots to No. 13 this week in the AP Top 25 . It's the school's highest ranking since Donovan McNabb led the Orange to a 10-point victory over Michigan in the Big House in September 1998.\n\nPerhaps more importantly for Babers, the Orange are 1-0 in November, the month that has been their Achilles' heel, mainly because of injuries. Instead of reeling \u2014 Syracuse was 1-11 in November the previous three years \u2014 the Orange are on a roll with three straight ACC wins, including two in a row without a turnover, and know they'll finish the regular season with a winning record. They went 4-8 twice under Babers and once under former coach Scott Shafer.\n\nThe win over Wake Forest snapped the Orange's eight-game conference losing streak.\n\n\"It's a huge thing. Winning on the road is a huge accomplishment for us,\" quarterback Eric Dungey said. \"Hopefully, it's the first of four (November wins). Everyone's together. I think it's just everybody really bought in. The past couple of years we've been through a lot.\"\n\nBabers attributes much of the team's good fortune to a change in the way he's approached the season, and it started in spring ball.\n\n\"I took a lot of planning into trying my best to make sure this team came to November healthy. We changed up a lot of stuff,\" Babers said Monday. \"We did not do things exactly the same. That's the definition of insanity.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if those things were going to help us. I just know that we did it a certain way the two years before and it didn't work. So, it didn't make sense to keep doing the exact same thing. That's not my nature.\"\n\nBabers said one of the goals has been \"to rotate and do things from a physical and game standpoint that gives different units an opportunity to rest their bodies.\"\n\nAlthough the strategy has worked, Babers remains wary.\n\n\"We're in a situation where it seems like we're healthier,\" he said. \"We're still one or two or three injuries away from where we were.\"\n\nThe biggest factor in the team's November struggles was the health of Dungey, or lack of it. The dual-threat star, a fiery presence on the field and off, sat out the final three games of each of the past three seasons with injuries.\n\nThis year Dungey is healthy and, unlike yesteryear , has often displayed he's more than willing to opt for a slide to safety instead of a head-on collision with a defender when he's running the ball. He is one of 15 seniors on the team.\n\n\"The senior class, especially, is really taking care of their bodies,\" Babers said. \"They are not as tired as they were in 2017, 2016. They're really, really locked in. These guys are different. You can just tell they're different. They understand what the word moderation means. It gives them an opportunity to do something special.\n\n\"We'll see. Doesn't mean it's going to happen. It just means they have a chance.\"\n\nSyracuse had five rushing TDs and 264 yards on the ground in the 41-24 victory over the injury-riddled Demon Deacons, tops for the team this season in conference play. Dungey took advantage of Wake Forest's attempt to limit the passing game and rushed for a team-high 119 yards on 24 carries, scoring on a 26-yard run. He now has six 100-yard rushing games and 30 TDs on the ground in his career, and his 1,867 career rushing yards place him 12th all-time among ACC quarterbacks.\n\n\"He's gone two games (with zero turnovers),\" Babers said. \"That's what big-time quarterbacks do.\"\n\nThe Orange's final three November games are against struggling Louisville (2-7, 0-6) in the home finale on Friday night, No. 3 Notre Dame (9-0) at Yankee Stadium and at No. 17 Boston College (7-2, 4-1).\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 To be a productive member of the New England Patriots, it's usually best to approach the game plan each week with adaptive eyes.\n\nNo one has learned that lesson more this season than receiver Cordarrelle Patterson.\n\nWhen he was traded by Oakland to the Patriots in March, Patterson arrived in New England hoping to land a place on Tom Brady's receiving corps following an offseason shake-up that saw the departures of both Brandin Cooks and Danny Amendola.\n\nBut after a Week 3 neck injury sent veteran running back Rex Burkhead to injured reserve and rookie Sony Michel's knee injury in Week 7 stunted his strong start, it created a void at another position that itself was recovering from the free agency loss of Dion Lewis.\n\nThe natural solution seemed to be an increased role for veteran James White. Instead the coaching staff chose creativity over predictability.\n\nTwo productive games at running back later, Patterson has become the latest Patriots player to excel in an unconventional role in New England.\n\nPatterson led the Patriots with 61 rushing yards, including a 5-yard touchdown in their 31-17 victory over the Green Bay Packers Sunday night . It was the second straight week he led the team in rushing and came two weeks after he had a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against the Bears.\n\nThat's just about right for a player called \"Flash\" early in his career.\n\n\"I said I wanted 25 carries this week,\" Patterson said. \"Whenever my number's called I'm being ready for whatever I need to do on the football field.\"\n\nUsing Patterson out of the backfield isn't as much of a stretch as it might seem.\n\nCoach Bill Belichick said he noted the 6-foot-2, 220-pounder's ability to make plays from there when studying his 2017 film with the Raider. He rushed 13 times for 121 yards and two scores with Oakland last season, an average of 9.3 yards per carry.\n\nPatterson was used by the Patriots on some reverses early in the season, again impressing his new coaches with his speed and power attacking holes.\n\n\"He's worked really hard with the ball handling, the reads, but boy, he runs hard. He runs fast and he's a hard guy to tackle,\" Belichick said. \"Like a lot of our guys have, they just step in, fill the role that we need for them and help the team win, and that's really what it's all about.\"\n\nThat's become the theme for role players under Belichick.\n\nFullback James Develin was an undrafted defensive end out of Brown before finding a home as the Patriots' fullback. Matt Slater arrived in New England as a receiver but became its special teams captain and a seven-time Pro Bowler.\n\nWhite said Patterson's natural skillset and willingness to accept coaching have been his biggest attributes in acclimating to the Patriots' culture.\n\n\"He's a strong, fast, explosive guy,\" White said. \"He can score any time he touches the football and he's been trying to get better and better at it each week. The more he does it, the better he gets.\"\n\nMichel was questionable heading into Sunday's game with Green Bay and could return to action when the Patriots travel to Tennessee this week.\n\nFor now, Patterson said he's trying to stay humble and hungry in the role he's been given \u2014 however long it lasts.\n\n\"I mean it's the next man up. It's the NFL. If you can play, you can play,\" He said. \"We didn't like that the guys weren't ready, but every guy is going to step up because this is our job. This is our life.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Aaron McKie had player development duties in his first season as an assistant coach with the Philadelphia 76ers, which gave him a second-row spot on the bench based on the organizational seating chart. Just months removed from the end of a 13-year NBA career, McKie found it tough to disconnect from his former role as a team leader with his new one in his listen-and-learn role as a rookie coach.\n\n\"I'd be back there yelling all kinds of stuff,\" McKie said, laughing. \"I had no coaching etiquette whatever. I just didn't know.\"\n\nSixers coach Maurice Cheeks eventually pulled McKie aside and told him he needed to take it down a notch: \"This is why we have these other guys sitting up on the front of the bench.\"\n\nBut Cheeks, a basketball Hall of Famer, recognized the potential in McKie and knew one day the guard who helped lead the Sixers to the 2001 NBA Finals would eventually take a more prominent spot on the bench.\n\n\"One day you're going to be a coach and you're going to have an opportunity,\" McKie recalled Cheeks telling him.\n\nMcKie is finally ready to check in as head coach.\n\nMcKie is a coach-in-waiting at Temple, the program he took to the 1993 Elite Eight and where he sits sixth on the career scoring list as the Owls start their final season under Fran Dunphy. Temple appoints coaches much in the way the senate confirms a Supreme Court justice \u2014 they're practically jobs for life. Temple has had just four coaches since 1952 and Dunphy, who also coached Penn for 17 seasons, has held the job since 2006.\n\nBut in 2019, it's McKie's turn to resuscitate a program that has just one NCAA Tournament berth since 2013 and was picked to finish sixth this season in the American Athletic Conference. The Owls open their season Tuesday against city rival La Salle and McKie will be by Dunphy's side.\n\n\"He's still the head coach,\" McKie said. \"I have all these ideas and things in my mind that I want to do. But this is his team.\"\n\nThe 70-year-old Dunphy, who has a 557-315 career record, has said the decision to leave at the end of the season was his own and he wasn't encouraged to step down by the administration. He first met with Temple athletic director Patrick Kraft shortly after the Owls were eliminated from the NIT and a transition plan was put in place.\n\nDunphy offered few specifics on why he decided to leave other than, \"it just seemed like the right thing to do.\" He also did not handpick McKie as his successor, though he endorsed the move. McKie has not yet added additional responsibility to his duties.\n\n\"I've given Aaron and everybody else tremendous ownership over the years,\" Dunphy said. \"It's just sort of business as usual. We talk a lot about the process. He'll do great. His learning curve is not steep.\"\n\nDunphy's departure comes with a caveat that he's not retired. He'll continue to teach his management, theory and practice courses at the Temple business school and refused to rule out an eventual return to the bench.\n\n\"There's an unknown out there that is sort of exciting,\" Dunphy said. \"I haven't given it a whole lot of thought. These guys deserve my utmost attention to every game, every bounce, every pass.\"\n\nKnown as one of the classiest coaches in basketball, Dunphy was recently feted with the Dean Smith Award.\n\n\"He's not the norm. He's a throwback because he cares about people,\" McKie said. \"Does he want to continue to coach? Absolutely. He's a competitive guy and he wants to continue to coach. I'm sure it didn't play out the way he wanted it to play out. But I believe he's been very supportive toward me.\"\n\nMcKie is a bit of a throwback himself for a program he helped take to some of its greatest heights under Hall of Fame coach John Chaney. Raised by his grandmother in one of the roughest parts of North Philadelphia, and starred at Simon Gratz High School before he signed at Temple. He failed to meet the SAT minimum and sat out a year as a Prop 48 student but went on to earn a degree in social work. A starter for all 92 career games, he averaged 17.9 points and led to Owls to 60 wins, three NCAA Tournaments and was a first-round pick by Portland in 1994.\n\nWhen he returned to Temple in 2014, there were days he thought he wasn't cut out for the recruiting grind rather than the luxe life in the NBA. But the pull to make a difference for disadvantaged kids made the job worth sticking out.\n\n\"They're a lot like me,\" he said. \"A lot of these kids, they come in with scars.\"\n\nCharles Barkley stopped by a recent practice and former teammate Allen Iverson hits up McKie with potential recruits in Virginia. After a recent scrimmage against Georgetown, where Iverson starred, McKie told Hoyas coach Patrick Ewing how Iverson had some players he thought could help Temple.\n\n\"Man, I've been trying to get him up here for two years now and I ain't seen him yet,\" McKie recalled Ewing's response with a laugh. \"That's AI.\"\n\nMcKie will soon join a list of former players such as Ewing, Chris Mullin at St. John's and Penny Hardaway at Memphis who returned to their former programs in hopes of returning them to similar glory as when they were all-conference stars. Temple lost its shine in part because the program sacrificed the local rivalries in the Atlantic 10 for the geographically challenged AAC for the sake of the football team. For all his success, Dunphy never led the Owls past the second weekend of the tournament and not even Chaney, who made the Hall of Fame, went to a Final Four.\n\nMcKie sat out his freshman season at Temple. He can wait out one more to get his shot as head coach.\n\n\"If you do things right, the wins and the success will come,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He previously described Trump as a \u201cclown\u201d and admitted that living in D.C. and becoming a young father had steered him toward taking a more outspoken approach on social matters.\n\nAnd while some prominent NBA names such as Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich have voiced meaningful opinions ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote, Beal urged his fellow players not to spurn the opportunity to maximize the positive policy the league has toward encouraging free speech.\n\n\u201cMost definitely it is important for us to make our voice heard,\u201d Beal said. \u201c ... everybody looks at us as role models and these icons, but we are citizens, we pay our taxes just like everybody else. We put our shoes on just (like) everybody else.\n\n\u201cWe are not much different. It is just our incomes that are different. We are all human beings, we all have rights, and basketball is not going to be here forever. Our union and our league stands behind us if we are going to (speak out).

Ahead of a recent game in San Antonio, LeBron James entered the arena sporting a cap that supported O\u2019Rourke.\n\nWhile the NFL\u2019s relationship with politics and protest continues to be a thorny mess, the NBA has experienced few such incendiary issues, primarily due to its willingness to avoid a clunky, heavy-handed approach.\n\nPlayers generally are free to say what they like and a Colin Kaepernick-type situation is essentially unthinkable in the NBA, on a number of levels.\n\nBeal's desire to take a vested interest in matters that affect the future of the country increased dramatically recently.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really realize the importance of everything until I had my son,\u201d said Beal, whose son Bradley Jr. was born in July. \u201cI think a lot about the type of country he will be growing up in and the kind of life he will have and how I will have to teach him differently about how I was raised.\n\n\u201cHaving a newborn is a challenge in itself with me being a young guy and a young black guy, figuring out how I am going to raise him in this society, the judgmental world that we live in, and everything that comes with it.

Everybody always thinks their vote doesn\u2019t count but every one matters, every one counts. If you don\u2019t want to be that person who is regretful in the end, it is important to get out there and vote.\n\n\u201cIt is up to us to try to make a change.

(AP) \u2014 When Cesar Ruiz left New Jersey to visit IMG Academy in Florida, his mother said he wasn't coming back home.\n\nRuiz was not prepared for a long stay during the visit the summer before his junior year of high school. He figured the plan was to fly there with his mother to talk with coaches and check the place out before returning to figure out the next steps.\n\n\"If I had packed enough clothes, I would've stayed,\" Ruiz recalled Monday. \"I went back home because I had to make sure I got everything I wanted and needed.\"\n\nRuiz said his mother, Latoya Shambry, didn't want him to be with her in Camden, New Jersey, because it was a dangerous place to live and he could thrive at IMG in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nIt's all worked out for Ruiz, the starting center for No. 4 Michigan. He will be back in New Jersey this weekend, playing about an hour away from home as the Wolverines (8-1, 6-0 Big Ten, No. 5 CFP ) visit Rutgers (1-8, 0-6) on Saturday. Ruiz said a lot of familiar faces will be there.\n\n\"It was pretty rough in Camden with crime and violence,\" he said. \"She didn't want me in that area when I was getting scholarship offers and I had started to make a name for myself. Once I told her I had an opportunity to leave, she made sure I got away.\"\n\nRuiz is popular back home among friends and family only in part because they can potentially get free tickets. There's more to the affection people have for Ruiz back there and at Michigan. He always seems to be smiling.\n\n\"Caesar's personality is one that everybody enjoys, very enthusiastic every day,\" coach Jim Harbaugh said. \"Very gung-ho guy. Very popular with the players. Very respectful to the coaches and the staff.

He's on track to be an All-Big Ten player this season and he'll play in the NFL someday if he keeps getting better.\"\n\nThe Ruiz-led line has allowed running back Karan Higdon to have a seven-game streak with at least 100 yards rushing this season. The group up front has also given Shea Patterson time to pass to help the Wolverines strike a run-pass balance.\n\nWhile many wondered last summer if the offensive line would be a weakness, as it has been in recent years, Ruiz predicted the unit would become strength before the season started.\n\n\"When I said that, I meant it and it's happening,\" Ruiz said.\n\nMichigan has worn down its last eight opponents, running behind the 6-foot-4, 319-pound Ruiz and four teammates at least that big. It has happened so frequently Ruiz has learned the signs to look for from defensive linemen when they've had enough.\n\n\"Heavy breathing is a pretty much a giveaway,\" Ruiz said. \"It's a good feeling.

(Photo: KENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs expected, accused sexual predator Harvey Weinstein is seeking dismissal of the five remaining sex-crimes charges against him in New York, arguing that alleged police misconduct and perjury by one of his three accusers tainted the grand jury that indicted him.\n\nAlready, the criminal case for sexual assault and rape against Weinstein looked to be in trouble: One of the six counts involving one of the accusers was dropped by Manhattan prosecutors during a hearing last month.\n\nProsecutors acknowledged that the lead New York Police Department detective on the case may have improperly coached a witness and also failed to disclose crucial information to defense and prosecutors as required.\n\nThat left five counts involving two accusers pending. Weinstein was indicted by a New York grand jury in May.\n\nOn Monday, Weinstein's defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, filed motions asserting that the remaining charges should be thrown out because the grand jury proceeding that produced them was \"deeply flawed.\"\n\n\"The remaining five counts should also be dismissed because the perjury and police misconduct irreparably prejudiced the grand jury,\" Brafman argued.\n\nBrafman also reiterated arguments he's made in earlier motions seeking dismissal, that emails and texts from the other accusers to Weinstein after the alleged assaults \"clearly demonstrate that any sexual contact between Weinstein and both of these women was purely consensual.\"\n\nMore: Harvey Weinstein scandal: A complete list of the 87 accusers\n\nThe motions also seek the dismissal of sexual predator charges as based on \"constitutionally flawed legal theories and not supported by credible evidence.\"\n\nDanny Frost, spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and lead prosecutor in the case, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, declined to comment to USA TODAY.\n\nMore: Lawsuit alleges Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted teen, mogul's lawyer calls it 'preposterous'\n\nLast month, Illuzzi-Orbon said prosecutors wouldn't oppose dismissal of the count in the case involving accuser Lucia Evans, who was among the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual assault. She said he forced her to perform oral sex when they met alone in his office in 2004.\n\nBut the NYPD is now investigating whether Detective Nicholas DiGaudio encouraged a witness to keep quiet about possible discrepancies in Evans' testimony and to not disclose information helpful to the defense. DiGaudio was removed from the case in the wake of those allegations.\n\nStill, Illuzzi-Orbon insisted the rest of the case against Weinstein is strong and would move forward. \"In short, we are moving full steam ahead,\" she said.\n\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 20.\n\nAlthough nearly 100 women have accused the fallen movie mogul of sexual misconduct dating back decades, New York is so far the only jurisdiction to bring criminal charges against him. He is still under criminal investigation in other jurisdictions, including Los Angeles and London.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/05/weinstein-seeks-dismissal-all-criminal-charges-flawed-ny-indictment/1894911002/", "HiMirror Mini is an Alexa-enabled smart mirror than can scan your face and recommend skincare products for your complexion.

(Nov. 5) AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday in Cleveland. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Hitting the campaign trail on the eve of the nation's pivotal midterm elections, President Donald Trump warned supporters during a series of rallies Monday that Democrats would gut his agenda if they win control of the House and Senate.\n\n\"Everything we have achieved is at stake tomorrow,\" Trump told Republican supporters during a raucous arena rally in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the second of three events he held in the final run-up to Tuesday's balloting.\n\nAs he has throughout this election season, Trump accused Democrats of seeking \"socialism\" through higher taxes, a government \"takeover\" of health care, and new \"job-killing\" government regulations. He described Democrats as supporting \"open borders\" for \"criminal aliens,\" while touting the strong economy and low unemployment of the past several years.\n\nAfter blasting Democrats for most of the day, Trump said on stage and in an interview with Fox News he hoped to bring the country together after a divisive election.\n\n\"I do eventually want to unite, but the fact is we\u2019re driving them crazy,\" Trump said of Democrats. \"Hopefully it\u2019s going to all come together someday like a beautiful puzzle.\"\n\nMore: Midterm elections 2018: Here are the races to watch as campaign heads to homestretch\n\nAlso: What's at stake in the midterms?

Here's what you need to know before you cast your midterm ballot.\n\nBut there was little indication of Trump attempting to unite the country on the day ahead of an election that will decide control of Congress.\n\nTrump implored voters in Missouri to back Republican Josh Hawley over Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill in a final rally that stretched late into the night, capping a whirlwind campaign swing that included dozens of events in the nation\u2019s Senate battlegrounds.\n\n\"I need the people of Missouri to seize this incredible moment in history,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president had no public events scheduled on Tuesday.\n\nAt each rally, Trump introduced his daughter and senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump \u2013 and joked that it was no longer \u201cpolitically correct\u201d to describe a woman as beautiful. Trump, who drew criticism this year for appearing to criticize the #MeToo movement, has been accused of sexual harassment by several women.\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump is urging Republicans in Ohio to turn out for the midterm elections in order to keep his \"political movement going.\" (Nov. 5) AP\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to use the word beautiful anymore when you talk about women,\" Trump said. \"I will never call a woman beautiful again,\u201d the president said.\n\nTwo prominent White House officials also spoke in Fort Wayne, press secretary Sarah Sanders and presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway. Sanders, who often jousts with reporters at the White House, joked that \"we may be a little speechless\" because \"we're not used to friendly crowds.\"\n\nTrump featured the high-profile women at the rallies as both parties are hoping to make inroads with female voters who could be a key voting democratic on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking in Missouri, his third visit to the state since September, Trump also invited two Fox News hosts \u2013 Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro \u2013 on stage, both of whom praised the president\u2019s first two years in office.\n\nTrump spoke to Fox News in a live interview before the rally began.\n\nDemocrats said Trump's attacks reflect rising concern that Republicans will lose control of Congress.\n\nWhile making health care a major issue, Democratic officials said Trump's language has divided Americans, including his threats toward caravans of migrants from Central America who remain hundreds of miles from the U.S. border.\n\n\"Democrats have a very positive message of what we want to get done for the American people,\" said Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, speaking on CNN.\n\n\"But clearly the focus the president does every day by his tweets causes questions as to what we stand for as a nation and whether America's leadership has been just badly damaged by this administration.\"\n\nTrump and his aides have said they are confident that Republicans will hold onto their Senate majority, but the battle for the House is more difficult.\n\nAs he boarded Air Force One en route to Cleveland, Trump told reporters that \"something's happening. We'll see. I think we're going to do very well.\"\n\nLater in the day, when a reporter asked what would happen if the Democrats take the House, Trump said that \"we'll just have to work a little bit differently \u2013 it'll all work out, but I don't think that's going to happen.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think we're going very well in the House. I think we're doing very well in the Senate. There is something going on, OK?\"\n\nDuring the morning, Trump got on a conference call with supporters, urging they make sure that they and their friends get out to the polls.\n\nThe media would cast the election as \"a referendum on me and us as a movement,\" he said.\n\nWhile the economy is going in a good direction, Trump said Democrats would end Trump initiatives ranging from the tax cuts to reduced regulations.\n\nOpinion: Florida must restore voting rights to former felons: ex-state Supreme Court justice\n\n\"The potential is tremendous \u2013 unless we don't do well in the elections,\" he said.\n\nDuring that event, the president saved some of his sharpest criticism for Richard Cordray, the Democratic candidate for governor in Ohio who is running against Republican Mike DeWine. Cordray was previously the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe agency was created in response to the 2008 banking crisis, but it has become a target for Republicans because it represented tougher federal regulations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s hurt a lot of people.

From John Wall down to Jeff Green, the talent \u2014 and the potential to be a top-four team in the Eastern Conference \u2014 is there. So far, though, this group has been a trainwreck, off to a better start than just two teams (Chicago and Cleveland), and it ranks 26th and 25th in the league in offensive and defensive rating, respectively.\n\nMore: Which five teams are the NBA's biggest surprises?\n\nBrooks, who inked a five-year, $35 million deal with Washington in 2016, may have a little more leeway than some other head coaches in the league, but he's not immune to getting the boot. The time to turn this thing around is now.\n\nThe bright side? Adding a healthy Dwight Howard to the mix should give the Wizards a boost on both ends of the floor, and the upcoming schedule \u2014 Dallas, Orlando (twice), Miami, Cleveland and Brooklyn \u2014 could help spark a turnaround.\n\nLuke Walton, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nMagic Johnson said Sunday that Walton's job is safe, telling the Los Angeles Times that he's \"going to finish the season\" unless \"something drastic happens, which it won't.\"\n\nTime will tell. With the spotlight in Laker Land shining bright, all eyes will be on Walton to help right the ship. The Lakers are 4-6 since LeBron James came to town, and they've struggled in late-game situations. Much of that can be attributed to the array of new faces on the roster and the lack of experience of many of the team's young players, but Walton isn't blameless for the team's slow start.\n\nThe pressure isn't going anywhere. How will Walton respond?\n\nTom Thibodeau, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nAs both head coach and president of basketball operations for the Timberwolves, Thibodeau is feeling the pressure from multiple angles. Wolves owner Glen Taylor told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune before the start of the season that Thibodeau is a \"good coach\" and that he has faith in him, but with the Jimmy Butler saga still looming, his seat appears to be getting hotter by the day.\n\nThe Timberwolves, who under Thibodeau snapped their 13-year playoff drought last season, are off to a 4-6 start, and Butler has sat out three of those games. Franchise cornerstones Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, meanwhile, have struggled with consistency, and the Wolves have a net rating of minus-6.9 (24th in the NBA) \u2014 a massive dip from last season (plus-2.2; 10th in the NBA).\n\nTo make matters worse, it seems as though Wolves fans \u2014 who have booed Thibodeau during pregame introductions and created a change.org petition calling for Thibodeau's firing \u2014 have had enough.\n\nFollow Neuharth-Keusch on Twitter @tweetajnk", "bad url", "FILE - In this Sept. 23, 2018 file photo, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo (10) is carted off the field after being injured during the second half of an NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs, in Kansas City, Mo. Trying to pick up an extra yard on Sept. 23 cost Garoppolo the rest of this season with a torn left ACL when his leg buckled underneath him. He was hurt in the fourth quarter of a 38-27 loss to Kansas City after trying to cut up field instead of going out of bounds. That gave the 49ers only three games with the quarterback they signed to a $137.5 million, five-year contract after he won five straight games to wrap up last season. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Rookie head coach Mike Vrabel has no time to imagine how much better his struggling Tennessee offense might be if only three-time Pro Bowl tight end Delanie Walker hadn't broken his ankle in the Titans' season opener.\n\nNext man up is a necessity as much as a cliche in the NFL.\n\n\"You have to adjust,\" Vrabel said of losing the tight end with the most receptions in the NFL between 2013 and 2017. \"I think the one thing about winners is that they're flexible and they're able to adapt, among other things. We have to continue to move forward with the guys that we have.\"\n\nMarcus Mariota lost his favorite target, and the Titans are scraping along with the league's 30th best passing offense after winning a playoff game last January.\n\n\"It's asked a lot of the young guys to step up,\" Mariota said.\n\nHalfway through the NFL season, lots of stars, starters and key role players are sidelined by injuries with nobody topping the emotional departure of Seattle safety Earl Thomas after breaking his leg the same day Cincinnati tight end Tyler Eifert had his own gruesome leg injury. It's making a big impact on the standings.\n\nOH NO, JIMMY G\n\nTrying to pick up an extra yard Sept. 23 cost San Francisco its quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, for the rest of this season with a torn left ACL when his leg buckled in the fourth quarter of a loss to Kansas City. That left the 49ers only three 2018 games with the man they signed to a $137.5 million, five-year contract after watching Garoppolo win five straight to wrap up last season.\n\nGaroppolo's injury came three weeks after 49ers running back Jerick McKinnon tore his own ACL for a team that had all five offensive linemen hurt knees in a game.\n\nNow San Francisco's playoff drought is assured of reaching a fifth straight season with the painful lesson for Garoppolo that a team needs its quarterback to be available.\n\n\"That's something that Jimmy will probably look at differently going forward because now he'll remember this the rest of his life,\" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. \"Nothing against him. This happens with everyone. You see it every Sunday. It's a reminder for everyone why it's an obvious coaching point.\"\n\nSO MANY ACLS\n\nWhen Texans receiver Will Fuller tore his ACL, he joined a list that includes Jaguars receiver Marqise Lee , who didn't even make it to the regular season; Eagles running back Jay Ajayi; and Miami defensive end William Hayes, who tore his trying to avoid a roughing-the-passer penalty. Unfortunately, Hayes' foot caught in the ground as he tried to keep his weight off Derek Carr during a sack.\n\nMISSING ON DEFENSE\n\nDerek Barnett recovered Tom Brady's fumble to clinch the Eagles' Super Bowl victory in February, but season-ending shoulder surgery has sidelined Philadelphia's young defensive star. Green Bay lost defensive lineman Muhammad Wilkerson to an ankle injury.\n\nWAITING FOR BOSA\n\nDefensive end Joey Bosa has not played a snap this season for the Chargers because of a bone bruise in his left foot, an injury that happened Aug. 7 during training camp. Bosa, the 2016 Defensive Rookie of the Year, tried to get back for the regular season, then reinjured his foot Sept. 5 and has been sidelined since.\n\nThe Chargers hoped he might be back after their bye, but Bosa says he's still facing a week-to-week situation, while people keep asking him when he'll be ready. Being 6-2 has allowed the Chargers to stay patient and avoid rushing him back again after what happened in September.\n\n\"The second my foot is ready to practice on a Wednesday I will play that week,\" Bosa said.\n\nMISSING COOK\n\nMISSING COOK\n\nLuckily, the Minnesota Vikings still had Latavius Murray while they waited for the return of running back Dalvin Cook . He played three of the first four games this season after reconstructive surgery on his left knee ended his rookie season, then sat out because of a hamstring injury until returning Sunday in a win over Detroit.\n\nThat's not the only issue for Minnesota, which is second in the NFC North after playing in the NFC championship last January. Rookie cornerback Mike Hughes , the 30th pick overall last April out of UCF, tore up his left knee in October.\n\nBATTERED FALCONS\n\nAtlanta has simply been decimated across the board in a season that started with hopes the Falcons might be the first team to play the Super Bowl on their own field. Both starting safeties and both starting guards are out for the season, top running back Devonta Freeman (groin) is on injured reserve and can't return until December. Even kicker Matt Bryant has been hurt.\n\nThat leaves Matt Ryan trying to carry the Falcons (4-4).\n\nANOTHER TANNEHILL INJURY\n\nRyan Tannehill has missed four straight games with an injured shoulder, the latest problem for the Miami quarterback who missed all of the 2017 season after tearing an ACL in training camp. That was the same knee that kept him out of the final four games of 2016. Tannehill hurt his throwing shoulder in Week 5 and is trying to work his way back to the field. Luckily for the Dolphins, Brock Osweiler is 2-2 as a fill-in \u2014 even with starting left guard Josh Sitton and center Daniel Kilgore both out for the season.\n\nDISEASE NOT INJURY\n\nFour-time Pro Bowl center Travis Frederick is off the Dallas roster as he deals with an auto-immune disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, which attacks nerves and leads to weakness in parts of the body. He has no idea when his football career will resume after dealing with numbness in both feet and hands and one arm. \"I was very relieved to finally have an idea of what it was,\" Frederick said.\n\nPOSSIBLE RETURNS\n\nRams cornerback Aqib Talib is out at least until Thanksgiving after being placed on injured reserve after needing surgery on an ankle early this season, while the Raiders are in the same situation after putting running back Marshawn Lynch on IR last month after surgery to repair an injured groin.\n\nAND THEY KEEP COMING\n\nDenver lost center Matt Paradis to a broken right leg when his own quarterback rolled up on him in the Broncos' 19-17 loss to Houston on Sunday. The 49ers lost running back Raheem Mostert to a broken arm and cornerback Emmanuel Moseley to season-ending shoulder surgery in San Francisco's win Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams is sidelined for several weeks following surgery on his right thumb. And right tackle Morgan Moses is listed as day-to-day with a knee injury. Washington signed three offensive linemen later Monday: guards Luke Bowanko and Jonathan Cooper and tackle Austin Howard. Gruden predicted that at least one new signign would have to start.\n\nThe last two days have represented quite the swing in momentum for the Redskins, who had won three straight and held a two-game lead in their division. But things have turned sour following Sunday\u2019s 38-14 loss to Atlanta. The news, confirmed by Gruden, brought a familiar sinking feeling for the Redskins and their fans. Last season they opened the season with a 3-2 record and appeared to be gaining momentum just before the injury bug hit hard, robbing the team of key starters. The Redskins managed only four wins the remainder of the season while juggling multiple starting offensive line combinations because of injuries.\n\nUntil Monday, Washington had become a surprise front-runner in the NFC East, but the Redskins' tragedy could open the door for their rivals.

(Nov 2) AP\n\nThe caravan of Central Americans who entered Mexican territory on Oct. 19 is regrouping in Mexico City this week. (Photo: Jose Mendez, EPA-EFE)\n\nCORDOBA, Mexico \u2013 Central Americans walking and hitching rides north in a caravan started reaching Mexico City over the weekend, marking another milestone on their winding odyssey toward the U.S. border as Americans vote in an election in which the immigrants became central characters.\n\nThe welcome in Mexico\u2019s capital city has been a warm one. The local government turned a sports complex into a shelter to accommodate more than 5,000 weary immigrants, who for three weeks endured sore feet, sickness and downpours and survived on their wits and the generosity of Mexicans of modest means.\n\nMexico City places the immigrants about 600 miles from the closest U.S. border crossing, in Brownsville, Texas. Denis Omar Contreras, a Honduran who works with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, an immigrant advocacy organization accompanying the caravan, said the group will probably head toward the California border, more than 1,700 miles away. That's the route previous caravans have taken to avoid the cartel-controlled territory in eastern Mexico.\n\nThe stop in Mexico City could be a prolonged one as the caravan regroups, members tend to their growing list of medical problems, and legal advocates talk them through their options.\n\n\"We'll have a place to rest up there,\" said Darby Flores, 28, a Honduran from the city of La Ceiba on the country's Caribbean Coast. He hoped that during the group's stay in Mexico City, \"they can provide us with a permit to travel throughout the whole of Mexico.\"\n\nAccording to data released by the Mexican government Nov. 3, 2,793 caravan members accepted an offer from Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to receive temporary work visas, health benefits and the chance to enroll their children in school. That leaves about 5,347 immigrants who refused, saying they want to try their luck in the USA, where they could earn in an hour what they would make working in Central America for a week.\n\nRodrigo Abeja, a project coordinator with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, said consular officials from the Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras will help replace identity documents and offer assistance. Lawyers will provide legal advice on each person's options for applying for asylum in Mexico or the USA.\n\nThe Mexico City government dispatched teams offering medical and legal assistance. A person participating in the Mexico City assistance program said the idea was to provide caravan participants with incentives to stay put rather than proceed to the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Monday that the presidents of Guatemala and Honduras called for an investigation to identify caravan organizers. The two countries have been under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to clamp down on the caravans.\n\nTrump hammered the caravan as a central campaign issue heading into Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. In recent weeks, he has vowed to cut off aid to Central American nations, threatened to seal the U.S.-Mexican border and deployed more than 7,000 active-duty troops to the border, adding to the 2,000 National Guardsmen and 16,500 Border Patrol agents there.\n\nOver the weekend, he cited the caravan throughout a series of campaign stops in hopes of rallying his political base to offset rosy forecasts for Democrats in the election.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats get elected \u2026 they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary city for violent predators and ruthless gang members,\" Trump told an audience in Pensacola, Florida, on Saturday. \"We will keep the criminals, drug dealers, terrorists the hell out of our country.\"\n\nTrump portrayed the caravan as a \"national emergency\" littered with gang members and violent criminals trying to illegally enter the USA. Most members of the last migrant caravan that arrived at the U.S. border this year legally presented themselves at ports of entry to apply for asylum.\n\nThat's the end goal for many members of the current caravan, which traveled a dangerous stretch through Veracruz over the weekend notorious for crimes committed against immigrants, such as kidnapping and extortion.\n\nBrother Jonathan Ortiz of the Missionaries of the Risen Christ religious order flags down a car near Sayula de Aleman in Mexico's Veracruz state on Nov. 3, 2018.

Villagers set up assistance stands along the route, offering food, drinking and clothing to immigrants passing by.\n\n\"We can\u2019t complain,\" Flores said. \"The Mexican people have helped us enormously.\"\n\n\u201cOur goal is to reach the United States, not spend too much time in one place,\u201d said Maria Elena Torres, 45, a Honduras native, as she climbed into a pickup with her 3-old-daughter for the trip to Mexico City. \u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d\n\nContributing Alan Gomez.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/05/migrant-caravan-donald-trump-midterm-elections-central-america-honduras-immigration-us-mexico-border/1891225002/", "Mississippi head coach Matt Luke watches a replay on the stadium monitor during the second half of an NCAA college football game against South Carolina, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Oxford, Miss.

Solis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMississippi's football program has earned the reputation of one that plays extremely hard and can occasionally put a bunch of points on the scoreboard.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rebels, it hasn't stopped them from becoming one of the worst teams in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nOle Miss (5-4, 1-4 SEC) continued a disappointing season last weekend when it lost 48-44 on its home field to South Carolina . The elements that have defined the past two months were there: Great effort, good offense, bad-to-terrible defense.\n\nAnd \u2014 ultimately \u2014 another disappointing loss.\n\n\"The attention to detail is what it takes to get over the hump,\" Ole Miss coach Matt Luke said. \"You can look at a thousand different plays from that game, the explosive plays, the turnovers in the red zone, but it's the attention to detail that we have to focus on. The little things it takes to win.\n\n\"The line is very, very small in the Southeastern Conference for winning football games.\"\n\nMore and more, the Rebels have been on the wrong side of that line, and they'll be sizable underdogs when they go on the road to face Texas A&M (5-4, 3-3) on Saturday.\n\nOle Miss' struggles aren't exactly surprising. There's been a malaise surrounding the program for at least three years, ever since it because apparent that an NCAA investigation into rules violations could bring serious trouble. It's about that time the Rebels started to lose more football games, too.\n\nThe fallout continued throughout 2017. Coach Hugh Freeze \u2014 who led the program to a Sugar Bowl win in 2015 \u2014 resigned because of a pattern of personal misconduct and the program was later hit with a two-year bowl ban and other penalties related to the NCAA case.\n\nIn many ways, Luke has done a good job just to keep the Rebels from crashing to rock bottom. He had a 6-6 record as the interim coach in 2017, which earned him the full-time job.\n\nOle Miss started this season with a 5-2 record, giving some brief optimism that the Rebels might be competitive again in the SEC. The offense has several talented players, led by quarterback Jordan Ta'amu, receiver A.J. Brown and running back Scottie Phillips.\n\nBut most of those early wins were against weak out-of-conference opponents. Recent losses to Auburn and South Carolina have put the program face-to-face with the reality that this is probably a long rebuilding project.\n\nThe Rebels are still drawing decent crowds, but optimism is waning.\n\nThe 42-year-old Luke has managed to stay positive throughout the ups-and-downs. Ole Miss did get some good news last week when it learned that some of the NCAA penalties related to recruiting restrictions had been reversed after the school appealed the initial ruling .\n\nMore than anything, Ole Miss is happy to be free of an NCAA case that lasted about six years.\n\nNow the Rebels are free to focus on future improvement.\n\n\"Just to put everything behind us \u2014 it's over,\" Luke said. \"All the recruiting restrictions are lifted, there are no more bowl bans, let's move forward and go attack this thing and see the big picture.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Injuries at running back and instability on the offensive line have Tennessee running out of answers for its stagnant ground attack.\n\nTennessee is averaging 127.7 yards rushing per game and 3.41 yards per carry , good for last in the SEC in both categories.\n\nThe Volunteers' rushing woes were glaringly apparent last week as Tennessee staggered to a 14-3 victory over Conference USA program Charlotte . Charlotte limited Tennessee to just 20 yards on 26 carries and held the Vols scoreless after the first quarter.\n\n\"We didn't block very well,\" Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \"We basically got whipped at the point of attack. We had some mental errors that we haven't been having for quite some time.\"\n\nTennessee (4-5, 1-4 SEC) now must try to solve its issues in the running game before its home game Saturday with No. 12 Kentucky (7-2, 5-2). Although Kentucky allowed 331 yards rushing in a 34-17 loss to No. 5 Georgia last week, the Wildcats rank eighth nationally in scoring defense and 33rd in run defense .\n\nThe struggles for Tennessee's running game actually began last year, when the Vols averaged 117.4 yards rushing per game and 3.41 yards per carry . The Vols hoped an improved offensive line featuring preseason all-SEC selection Trey Smith at tackle and Alabama graduate transfer Brandon Kennedy at center could boost the ground attack this year.\n\nKennedy played just one game before injuring his anterior cruciate ligament , knocking him out for the remainder of the season. Smith is out indefinitely after doctors found blood clots in his lungs, a recurrence of an issue that also prevented him from participating in spring practice .\n\nWithout Kennedy and Smith, Tennessee is searching for the right combination.\n\nTennessee opened the Charlotte game with a line that featured Marcus Tatum at left tackle, Jahmir Johnson at left guard, Ryan Johnson at center, Nathan Niehaus at right guard and Drew Richmond at right tackle. Late in the third quarter, Chance Hall stepped in at right guard with Niehaus moving to right tackle. K'Rojhn Calbert took over at left tackle down the stretch.\n\nThe Vols' single-game rushing total against Charlotte was their lowest output since being held to zero net yards rushing in a 34-3 loss to Mississippi in 2014 .\n\n\"We had too many mistakes Saturday, which went back to earlier in the year, guys blocking the wrong folks,\" Pruitt said. \"It's hard to have success when you do that.\"\n\nPruitt also said last week that his running backs were \"banged up\" without going into specifics. Tennessee's leading rushers this season are Tim Jordan and Ty Chandler, but they combined for just six of the Vols' 26 carries last week.\n\nTennessee's health concerns in the backfield have led to some roster shuffling.\n\nThe Vols' leading rusher against Charlotte was freshman Jeremy Banks, who had switched from running back to linebacker two weeks ago before moving back to offense. Carlin Fils-aime moved from the secondary to running back last month.\n\nWhen Banks started practicing with the running backs again last week, Pruitt said \"we want to make sure that we've got enough running backs to finish the year.\"\n\nPruitt says he expects all his running backs to be available against Kentucky.\n\n\"I'd say the health of our running backs is probably like everybody else,\" Pruitt said. \"It's November, and everybody has bumps and bruises. All of our guys will be ready to play.\"\n\nKentucky coach Mark Stoops remains wary of Tennessee's offense. Stoops complimented Tennessee's wide receivers and said they could indirectly help the Vols' rushing attack.\n\n\"Anytime you have the talent at wide receiver that they have, it always makes you conscious of those guys and not leaving your corners in one-on-one situations all day,\" Stoops said. \"That could open up opportunities for some big plays in the run game.\n\n\"They've had some injuries on the offensive line that I'm sure have not helped them, but they're a talented and good football team that's getting better with every game.\"\n\nNOTES: Pruitt said safety Trevon Flowers will probably be a \"game-day decision.\" A broken collarbone caused Flowers to miss Tennessee's last four games. ... Safety Micah Abernathy has missed four games with an ankle injury. Pruitt said Abernathy will start practicing this week and that \"we'll just see how it goes.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Gary Graves in Lexington, Kentucky, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Keep it fairly simple but not too simple,\" said Gruden, whose team has been at its most successful when Adrian Peterson runs the ball effectively but he had only 17 yards on nine carries against Atlanta. \"Still going to challenge our guys to do some great things and hopefully the guys that we sign can fit right in and play.\"\n\nAs it is, Washington already was facing injury issues along its line: Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams missed the game against Atlanta after having surgery on his dislocated right thumb and could be out another two or three weeks.\n\nPlus, Morgan Moses' status is considered day to day, Gruden said, after the starting right tackle hurt the MCL ligament in his right knee against Atlanta but returned to the game after limping off the field in the first half.\n\n\"This is something you don't want to go through. But it is pro football, and you have to go through it,\" Gruden said. \"Fortunately we have a very good line coach in Coach (Bill) Callahan.\"\n\nThings got so bad against Atlanta that the one healthy starting lineman, center Chase Roullier, ran over to the sideline while Scherff was being tended to on the field to check in with Callahan about who should play where.\n\n\"Just to figure out where he wanted guys to go,\" Roullier said. \"Maybe they want me at guard. Maybe they want me at center.\"\n\nIt turned out that he stayed at center, but otherwise, the shuffling went like this: Tony Bergstrom, who entered the game at left guard when Lauvao got hurt on the game's third play, shifted to right guard in place of Scherff; Ty Nsekhe, the backup who started at left tackle in place of Williams, moved to left guard; and rookie third-round draft picks Geron Christian made his NFL debut at left tackle.\n\nWashington essentially was out of linemen at that point, so if another injury had happened, Gruden said defensive end Matt Ioannidis would have been forced to play guard, something he said he'd never done at any level.\n\n\"We were about a hangnail away from that happening,\" Roullier said. \"That would have been interesting.\"\n\nRichardson's first season with the Redskins after leaving the Seattle Seahawks as a free agent ends with 20 catches for 262 yards and two TDs.\n\n\"Paul's been dealing with this thing all year,\" Gruden said of the AC joint injury. \"Toughed it out for eight weeks and I think the pain has been bothering him so much that he needs to get it fixed.\"\n\nGruden said that starting slot receiver Jamison Crowder, who's missed four games with an ankle injury, might practice Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The purple and blue colors are where there is the least ozone, and the yellows and reds are where there is more ozone. A United Nations report released on Nov. 5, 2018 says Earth\u2019s protective ozone layer is finally healing after aerosol sprays and coolants ate away at it. (Photo: NASA via AP)\n\nFinally some good news from the environment.\n\nThe ozone layer \u2013 which protects us from the sun's harmful radiation \u2013 is slowly healing, the United Nations announced Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good news,\u201d said NASA scientist Paul Newman, co-author of the U.N. report.\n\nOver the northern half of the world, the layer should be completely repaired by the 2030s, the report said. The good news is due to decades of worldwide cooperation to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals.\n\n\u201cIf ozone-depleting substances had continued to increase, we would have seen huge effects. We stopped that,\u201d Newman said. If nothing had been done to stop the thinning, the world would have destroyed two-thirds of its ozone layer by 2065, he said.\n\nThe infamous ozone hole over Antarctica is also recovering, although it will continue to occur each year until the 2060s. (Ozone will take longer to heal in the southern half of the world.)\n\nThe ozone layer is located up in the stratosphere some 7 to 25 miles above Earth\u2019s surface, according to NASA. It acts like sunscreen, shielding the planet from ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer and cataracts, suppress immune systems and damage plants.\n\nThe naturally occurring ozone high up in the atmosphere is the \"good\" ozone and is in contrast to the \"bad\" ozone near the surface, which is man-made pollution that can cause respiratory problems.\n\nScientists first discovered the dramatic thinning in Earth's protective ozone layer in the 1970s and determined the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in refrigerators and aerosol sprays, caused the problem.\n\nIn the late 1980s, 196 countries signed the Montreal Protocol, a treaty that limited production of CFCs around the world. Businesses soon came up with safer alternatives for spray cans and refrigerators.\n\nScientists say the way humanity tackled the ozone problem also provides a template for how we can counteract human-caused global warming.\n\n\u201cThe Montreal Protocol is one of the most successful multilateral agreements in history for a reason,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Programme. \u201cThe careful mix of authoritative science and collaborative action that has defined the protocol for more than 30 years and was set to heal our ozone layer is precisely why the Kigali Amendment holds such promise for climate action in the future,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe Kigali Amendment calls for slashing the future use of powerful climate-warming gases known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in refrigerators, air conditioners and cars.\n\n\u201cCarbon dioxide emissions remain by far the most important greenhouse gases which are driving global warming,\" said World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. \"But we can also help tackle climate change by reducing our commitment to other gases, including HFCs.

(AP Photo/Chris Seward) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida State needed to shake things up so Willie Taggart has turned over the play-calling duties to his offensive coordinator.\n\nTaggart said \"he's not a big ego guy\" and after a rocky start in his first season as the Seminoles (4-5, 2-5 Atlantic Coast Conference) head coach, he opted to let offensive coordinator Walt Bell call plays in the 47-28 loss at North Carolina State. Despite losing, Bell will call the shots against this week against third-ranked Notre Dame (9-0, No. 4 CFP).\n\n\"I thought Walt did a good job of calling plays,\" Taggart said. \"Obviously, we didn't get the win but I thought him doing that was good, and allowing me to see and be a part of other things within our program. I thought I was able to interact with our players a lot better, a lot more on the sidelines when I needed to.\"\n\nIt's a major change for Taggart, who called the plays in 2015-16 when he was at South Florida and in 2017 at Oregon.\n\nHis USF offense was No. 4 nationally in scoring offense (43.8 points) in 2016 and the Ducks were 18th (36 points) in 2017. Taggart hasn't had that kind of success with the Seminoles.\n\nFlorida State is 106th in the FBS in scoring (23.8 points), struggling behind an injury-depleted and inconsistent offensive line. The Seminoles have allowed 28 sacks (117th) and the run game has been woeful, averaging just 76.9 yards per game (128th).\n\nBell could provide a needed change-up. He is considered a rising star in the coaching profession because of his dynamic offenses as a play-caller at Arkansas State (2014-15) and Maryland (2016-17). Taggart and Bell had no prior friendship before he was brought to Florida State but the two coaches favor fast-paced, spread offenses.\n\nQuarterback James Blackman made his first start of the season against the Wolfpack, filling in for injured starter Deondre Francois (ribs). Blackman completed 29 of 46 passes while setting career-highs for passing yards (421) and touchdown passes (four).\n\nThe sophomore was accurate in connecting on 19 of 24 passes through the first three quarters but wasn't able to help the Seminoles rally from a 37-21 deficit in the final quarter.\n\nTaggart said he has not decided if Blackman or Francois will start at Notre Dame.\n\n\"We'll go through the week and see how Deondre is doing, see how these guys are practicing throughout the week,\" Taggart said. \"We'll make that decision later in the week.\"\n\nFlorida State also could be without two of its top offensive linemen. Tackle Landon Dickerson, who has been limited to just two games in 2018 due to an ankle injury, is not ready to return to practice, Taggart said. Guard Cole Minshew (neck stinger) also remains day-to-day.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

His preacher father Marshall (Russell Crowe) is ashamed and decides to send Jared off to Christian-based gay conversion therapy. His mother, Nancy (Kidman), silently acquiesces.\n\nThen this Christmas, Kidman takes the lead in \u201cDestroyer\u201d (out Dec. 25), a crime noir in which she plays Erin Bell, an alcoholic LAPD detective who has largely abdicated parenting duties to her teenage daughter as she throws herself into a decades-long quest to bring down a gang leader she failed to nab years before.\n\nThe pair of tour de force performances are earning Kidman raves and Oscar predictions.\n\nReview: Powerful gay-conversion drama 'Boy Erased' puts faith in standout Lucas Hedges\n\nMore: Nicole Kidman's Nashville tree house is a key part of her parenting strategy\n\nOscar watch! You'll barely recognize Nicole Kidman in 'Destroyer'\n\n\u201cI\u2019m playing mothers who are on different ends of the spectrum,\u201d says Kidman, 51, a frothy cappuccino quickly losing heat by her side. In \"Destroyer,\" Erin \u201cis working through enormous pain and shame and wreckage,\" she says, while Arkansas mom Nancy \"is all love-based, is all about her child and still had to navigate through something that she did to him that she now feels incredibly ashamed about.\u201d\n\nCLOSE \"Boy Erased,\" starring Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe and Lucas Hedges, follows the true story of a Baptist family struggling with homophobia. USA TODAY\n\nConversion therapy, an attempt to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity through tactics that range from hypnosis to shaming, is still common across the United States. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any idea it existed,\" Kidman says. \"I was just like, 'Is this real? Still?' \u201d\n\nAccording to a UCLA study, 698,000 LGBTQ Americans have undergone some form of conversion therapy. This year, almost 50 bills have been introduced targeting the discredited medical practice in 24 states, but even if they pass, church- or preacher-organized therapy would not be covered under the law.\n\nJoel Edgerton, who directs (and stars in) \"Boy Erased,\" which is based on the 2016 memoir by Garrard Conley, knows his film is landing as the Trump administration is moving to define gender at birth, a pledge that clearly targets the LGBTQ community.\n\nThough the trans community isn't the focus of \"Boy Erased,\" the government's recent stance \"is very much part of the conversation that we're having,\" Edgerton says. \" 'Boy Erased,' while it's just a story of one family ... it speaks to the rights and freedoms of the (LGBTQ) community in general.

She says she hopes the film drives home the message that \"you can navigate as a family through anything if you stay with the love.\"\n\nShe wants gay children to watch \"Boy Erased\" and \u201cfeel safe. We all want to make the world feel safe. That there\u2019s somewhere you can go where you\u2019ll be understood, where you\u2019re listened to and you\u2019re believed. ... And I love also that (Jared's mother) in the film apologizes to her child. I think there\u2019s power in apology. And I really believe healing can happen when there\u2019s a heartfelt apology.

And sometimes not,\" she says, describing an \"out there\" passion project she can't get made. \"That\u2019s the reality. We cannot get funding for it. ...

(AP Photo/Mike McCarn) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 D.J. Moore has a running joke with Curtis Samuel before every game about which of the young Panthers receivers is \"going to go off\" that day.\n\nRecently it's been one or the other with a big game \u2014 and sometimes both.\n\nThe two versatile and dangerous speedsters \u2014 Moore is a rookie, while Samuel is in his second season and essentially a rookie as well after an injury-plagued 2017 \u2014 still have plenty to learn in Norv Turner's offensive system, but their skillset and big-play ability is making the Panthers (6-2) more unpredictable and difficult to defend.\n\nCoach Ron Rivera said Samuel and Moore have brought a \"different dimension\" to a Carolina offense that has erupted for 99 points in the last nine quarters.\n\nBoth are tough to catch, let alone tackle with the ball in their hands in the open field.\n\nSo Turner is doing everything he can to get the ball in their hands, not just as receivers, but as rushers, too. Together Samuel and Moore have run 10 times for 159 yards with two touchdowns on reverses or double reverses. They also have 27 catches for 403 yards and three TDs receiving entering Thursday night's game at Pittsburgh.\n\n\"When they're focused, there are no young players that I wouldn't put those guys up against in this league because they have the physicality, the playmaking ability, and the want-to,\" quarterback Cam Newton said of the team's young dynamic duo.\n\nOn Sunday, it was Samuel who had the bigger impact.\n\nDespite playing only 17 plays, he scored on a 33-yard double reverse, a play in which he reversed field and covered 103 yards on the ground according to the NFL's NextGen Stats. Later, he made a leaping 19-yard touchdown catch in the end zone with a defender draped all over him to help seal Carolina's 42-28 win over Tampa Bay .\n\n\"He is just explosive and he is a dynamic playmaker,\" Rivera said of Samuel. \"A lot like in the mold of D.J., he is tough to bring down. ... We have a couple of young guys who can be explosive.\"\n\nMoore played 53 snaps and chipped in with a 32-yard run and a 16-yard reception vs. the Bucs, one week after posting a career-best 129 yards from scrimmage in a 36-21 win over Baltimore.\n\nSamuel is finally healthy after missing the first three games of this season with a heart issue and most of last season with a broken ankle.\n\n\"It's amazing after what happened last year,\" Samuel said of his production. \"To go down unexpectedly and to fight through the offseason and preparing myself to get back from my ankle injury, and to come back and finally be out there to make plays and contribute to the team, it's amazing.\"\n\nTight end Greg Olsen, who has been with the team since 2011, said the Panthers have never had this many offensive players that can tear off big gains with the ball in their hands.

Sege, an author on the revised policy and past member of the group's Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, in a statement.\n\n\"Yet corporal punishment remains legal in many states, despite evidence that it harms kids \u2014 not only physically and mentally, but in how they perform at school and how they interact with other children.\"\n\nThe updated statement was published online Monday and will appear in the December journal Pediatrics.\n\nThe AAP cites research claiming corporal punishment or harsh verbal abuse not only won't change behavior over the long term, but can make children more aggressive.\n\nThe group urges parents to create disciplinary plans where they stay in control. Meanwhile, they recommend pediatricians help parents with age-appropriate plans for disciplining kids, including advising them of community groups offering assistance.\n\n\"It's best to begin with the premise of rewarding positive behavior,\" said Dr. Benjamin S. Siegel, a co-author of the revised policy and fellow of the AAP, in a statement.\n\n\"Parents can set up rules and expectations in advance. The key is to be consistent in following through with them.\"\n\nSeveral studies have shown adverse affects for children who are spanked. A study published last year in the \"Journal of Pediatrics\" found spanked children were more likely to commit dating violence later in life.\n\nA separate study published last month in BMJ Open found countries banning corporal punishment experienced significantly lower rates of physical violence among adolescents.\n\nA 2015 survey from Pew Research Center found only four percent of Americans spank their kids often as a form of discipline, while one in six parents say they use spanking some of the time.\n\nAaron Cooper, Ph.D., director of Child, Adolescent and Family Services at The Family Institute at Northwestern University said the revised policy from AAP could help parents who choose to spank their kids consider other options.\n\n\"Few parents want to think of themselves as damaged, whether as a result of being spanked or anything else our parents did to us,\" said Cooper in an email to USA TODAY. \"To give up spanking, we need to recognize its potential to harm.\"\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/05/spanking-harms-children-american-academy-pediatrics-says/1889588002/", "CLOSE President Donald Trumps tweeted a video likening Central American immigrants to dangerous criminals.

NBC's decision to run the ad was met by a public outcry after it aired Sunday. In less than 24 hours, the network announced it would no longer run the spot.\n\n\"After further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\" NBC Universal spokesman Joe Benarroch said in a statement Monday.\n\nFox News also announced in a statement Monday that, \"Upon further review, Fox News pulled the ad yesterday and it will not appear on either Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network.\"\n\nThe ad continued to run on Facebook into Monday morning, targeting social media users in Florida and Arizona. But the ad is now inactive and a message says it was \"taken down because it goes against Facebook\u2019s advertising policies.\"\n\nThe decision to pull the ad followed an outpouring of social media outrage.\n\nProducer and director Judd Apatow called the airing of the ad \"a low point in the history of @nbc.\"\n\nIt was a low point in the history of @nbc.

Your questions are offensive a lot of the time.\"\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the midterms, Trump has pushed to make immigration a key issue, and the migrant caravan \u2013 which is made up of people fleeing violence, corruption and poverty in their home countries \u2013 has been at the center of that.\n\nLast week, Trump tweeted a similar, longer ad, which linked Bracamontes to the caravan and blamed Democrats for the convict being in the country. Critics called that spot divisive and racist.\n\nFact checkers also found that ad to be misleading.\n\nBracamontes, who was sentenced to death for the 2014 murder of two California deputies, entered the country illegally on at least two occasions. But court records show his case was handled primarily by Republicans, the Arizona Republic reported. At least one of his deportations occurred while former President Bill Clinton was in office, the other during the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nCNN reported that ad was also produced for the Trump campaign. But it notably did not feature the traditional, FEC-mandated endorsement at the end of the commercial. Ixnay PAC's Jason Mojica reported that is because internet communications are excluded from the law requiring such a disclaimer.\n\nThe shorter commercial that was pulled by NBC, Fox and Facebook opens with shots of the \"7,000 migrant caravan, crossing Mexico, marching toward our border\" and then, without the narrator taking a pause, abruptly jumps to shots of Bracamontes.\n\n\"Dangerous, illegal criminals like cop-killer Luis Bracamontes don't care about our law,\" the narrator continues, amid shots of a Bracamontes smiling in court and saying he regrets that \"I just killed two.\"\n\nThe ad then cuts back to the caravan, declaring, \"America cannot allow this invasion. The migrant caravan must be stopped.\" Next, we see President Donald Trump speaking with immigration officials as the narrator says Trump \"and his allies will protect our border and keep our families safe.\"\n\nIt closes by telling the viewer as a woman steps into a voting booth, \"America's future depends on you. Stop the caravan, vote Republican.\" A disclaimer explains the ad was paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. and that Trump approved the message.\n\nCNN refused to air the ad, prompting Donald Trump Jr. to tweet, \"I guess they only run fake news and won\u2019t talk about real threats that don\u2019t suit their agenda.\"\n\n\"CNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist,\" the cable news network's communication department tweeted in response. \"When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined.

(Photo: Rick Bowmer, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court was torn Monday between Virginia's desire to keep the largest deposit of uranium in the United States underground and efforts by industry groups to mine it for economic gain.\n\nOn one hand, Virginia Solicitor General Toby Heytens told the justices that removing up to 119 million pounds of uranium ore would entail \"a massive earth-moving mine operation\" that would detract from southern Virginia's rustic scenery and tourism industry.\n\nOn the other hand, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco warned that letting the state dictate development rules would represent \"a road map for undermining a multibillion-dollar industry.\"\n\nA number of justices sympathized with the state, which has won two lower court rulings that upheld its 1970s law banning uranium mining. But ironically, they noted that if the state's purpose was overall radioactive safety, the federal government has authority over the more dangerous processes \u2013 milling uranium and disposing of its waste products.\n\n\"In the real world, it's not separated,\" Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe case is one of several pitting states against the federal government, which often struggles in a court attuned to states' rights. Earlier Monday, the justices wrestled with Alaska's claim of authority over commerce on rivers that run through federal land.\n\n\"In the state of Alaska, the rivers are the roads,\" said Matthew Findley, the lawyer representing a man who used a hovercraft to hunt moose inside a federal preserve.\n\nThe Virginia case hinges on what purpose state lawmakers had in banning uranium mining \u2013 safety, scenery, or something else. But courts generally avoid looking beyond the language of laws to discern motives.\n\nIn 1983, the high court upheld a California law blocking new nuclear power plants because the state claimed its purpose was economics, not safety. Otherwise, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would have had clear jurisdiction.\n\nAssociate Justice Neil Gorsuch said Virginia might have a stronger case than California because mining isn't risky, compared with the milling and nuclear waste management that comes later. The state may have had other motives for the ban as well, he said.\n\nBut several justices warned that siding with Virginia could send a message to states that they can intrude on federal authority by claiming to have other reasons for their actions.\n\n\"It seems to present real opportunities for gamesmanship as well, sort of bad incentives for a state,\" Associate Justice Elena Kagan said. \"Just cover over your purpose?\"\n\nMore: Supreme Court won't halt unusual climate change lawsuit brought by children on behalf of 'future generations'\n\nMore: Supreme Court: Conservative groups see opportunities to cut regulation, shore up property rights\n\nMore: Supreme Court's latest church-state conundrum: Must a 'peace cross' memorial to World War I vets come down?\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/05/supreme-court-balances-safety-economy-dispute-over-uranium-mining/1892684002/", "Los Angeles Chargers kicker Caleb Sturgis (6) gets a pat from teammate Michael Schofield after missing a field goal against the Seattle Seahawks during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Seattle.

Our NFL insiders break down the biggest storylines from the weekend of action. USA TODAY\n\nLos Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay talks to quarterback Jared Goff (16) in the fourth quarter against the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. (Photo: Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Marcus Peters could have tried to come up with some kind of excuse. But the Los Angeles Rams cornerback saw no point.\n\nHe got beat early, often and late while matched up with New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas. The 72-yard touchdown catch that Thomas hauled in with roughly four minutes left to play \u2013 dusting Peters as he sprinted the remaining 45 yards to pay dirt \u2013 represented the knockout punch in New Orleans\u2019 45-35 victory. The result snapped the Rams\u2019 eight-game unbeaten streak and established the Saints as the NFC\u2019s front-runner.\n\nPeters was asked for clarity on his struggles. Had he expected help from a safety on the long touchdown? Was ankle injury that hampered him early in the year still a factor against Thomas, who caught 12 passes for a franchise record 211 yards?\n\nPeters, however, wasn\u2019t in the mood to search for an explanation.\n\n\u201c(Expletive) happens like that in football. ... I got beat on the play. I can stand up and own it,\u201d he said, an edge in his voice as he fought to contain his emotions. \u201cI been playing (expletive) these last couple weeks, and that\u2019s just being honest. But me, I\u2019ll just continue to fight. That\u2019s the type of player I am. Who gives a (expletive)? You\u2019re going to get beat in football. You go out there and compete to the highest of your ability, but (expletive) happens.\n\n\u201cCoach wouldn\u2019t have me out there if I wasn\u2019t healthy. I own up to that,\u201d continued Peters, a two-time Pro Bowl selection and all-pro in 2016. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019ve had a bad few weeks. I know I\u2019m a top (expletive) corner in this league and I ain\u2019t been playing like that. I put that (loss) on me.\u201d\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 9 of the 2018 NFL season\n\nMore: NFL Week 9 winners, losers: LA Chargers surging, Tom Brady gets better of Aaron Rodgers\n\nPeters\u2019 teammates refuted his claim that the defeat fell squarely on his shoulders. But like the cornerback, they view the outcome as merely a speed bump rather than something that would derail their season.\n\n\u201cEveryone got to be humbled, and today was our day,\u201d said running back Todd Gurley, whom the Saints limited to 68 rushing yards and a touchdown.\n\nDespite their frustration, the Rams understand that a loss doesn't have to be devastating. The defeat does give the Saints a leg up in the pursuit of home-field advantage. But, as Peters said, stuff happens. There\u2019s a reason why the 1972 Dolphins perfect campaign remains the only of its kind: Perfection in the NFL is virtually unattainable.\n\nFor Los Angeles, it\u2019s the response to the defeat that matters most now.\n\nSome Rams players expected to actually feel a degree of relief in the coming days now that the quest for perfection has ended.\n\nOthers, relaying the post-game message from coach Sean McVay, said that the challenges of the last two weeks (rallying and then hanging on late to defeat the Packers and coming back from 21 down to tie the Saints before falling short) will eventually prove beneficial.\n\nSunday revealed multiple deficiencies for Los Angeles' defense. Sure, Peters got toasted by the Saints. And coach Sean Payton told reporters after the game, \u201cThey were going to travel Marcus to (Thomas), and that was fine by us. We thought we really liked that matchup \u2014 a lot.\u201d\n\nBut this defense has fallen short of expectations. The Rams rank a pedestrian 14th against the pass (243.3 yards per game) and are tied for 13th in sacks (22). Aaron Donald can\u2019t be the only guy consistently getting after the quarterback, which is a big reason why L.A. traded for Dante Fowler. And the Rams can\u2019t just expect the healthy return of top corner Aqib Talib to magically fix things either. All of their defensive backs must raise their level of play. The same goes for the linebackers, who struggled to cover both do-it-all running back Alvin Kamara (four catches for 34 yards and a touchdown) and tight end Benjamin Watson (three catches for 62 yards and a score).\n\nThere\u2019s no questioning the continued growth of third-year quarterback Jared Goff, who shrugged off setbacks against New Orleans and kept attacking downfield. Offensive players drew encouragement from their ability to work through rough patches and rediscover their rhythm like they did in the second half against the Saints.\n\nBut after Sunday\u2019s defeat, it\u2019s more evident than ever that if the Rams expect to make their Super Bowl aspirations a reality, they will need much more out of a defensive unit that has surrendered an average of 31.4 points and 424.4 yards per game against opponents with records of .500 or better.\n\n\u201cAdversity is necessary in this league,\u201d safety Lamarcus Joyner said. \u201cEspecially games like this when it\u2019s the type of opponents you\u2019re going to see in the playoffs. It\u2019s good to get that adversity early and know how you can get better as a team.\u201d\n\nPeters agreed and made a prediction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually going to be a good thing for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get to go back to work and have an extra hunger.\u201d\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney walks the sidelines during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Louisville, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Clemson, S.C.

The latest was a 77-16 victory over Louisville for the second-largest margin of victory ever in an ACC game.\n\nCo-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott believes the Tigers' success comes from their steady approach. They don't seem to elevate their enthusiasm or effort to match the moment, instead they simply rely on what they've done all season.\n\n\"I like the focus, intensity we've had in games,\" Scott said. \"We're continuing to get better.\"\n\nClemson has excelled in big games this season, and have had a couple of close calls.\n\nThe Tigers stopped a two-point conversion at Texas A&M in week two to escape with 28-26 victory. They were down 10 points to then-undefeated Syracuse in the fourth quarter before rallying for a 27-23 win on Sept. 29.\n\nAnd they turned one Top 25 showdown against 5-0 North Carolina State into a 41-7 rout three weeks ago.\n\nScott believes the Tigers won't flinch against the Eagles, either, even if they haven't been truly tested in more than a month.\n\n\"You look for poise in those situations,\" he said Monday. \"I don't feel like at any point we lost our poise.\"\n\nThat goes for freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence, too.\n\nLawrence passed for more than 300 yards in blowouts over North Carolina State and Florida State. He threw for just 59 yards \u2014 although he had two touchdown passes \u2014 as Clemson went to the ground to pound the Cardinals.\n\nLawrence, the 6-foot-6 newcomer who leads the ACC with 18 touchdowns, has not yet been part of tight, fourth-quarter contest since winning the starting job in mid-September.\n\nLawrence watched Clemson's comeback against Syracuse from the sidelines with a neck strain, knocked out in the second quarter by the Orange.\n\nBut Lawrence, who said he's never been north of Virgini a, said he and the offense are ready for the challenge. \"We've shown earlier in the season we can win close games and we can find a way to win,\" he said. \"I think it's been good to play well these past few weeks so we don't have to go into the fourth quarter.\"\n\nClemson coach Dabo Swinney said the Tigers work all season long for the chance to win championships and don't plan to let outside worries get in their way.\n\n\"This is what it's all about,\" he said. \"We hope to have an opportunity like this down the stretch, so here we are.\"\n\nClemson's chance at an ACC title won't be crushed with a Boston College win, although it's unlikely the Tigers can remain among the College Football Playoff's top four without a defeat.\n\nBoston College still must face Florida State and Syracuse this month. A loss by the Eagles \u2014 as long as Clemson defeats Duke on Nov. 17 \u2014 would send the Tigers back to the ACC championship game.\n\nEagles coach Steve Addazio is also fully focused on Clemson and wants to make it a raucous atmosphere on campus come Saturday night.\n\n\"I hope our fan base is as energized as our team right now,\" Addazio said. \"We're very grateful and fortunate that we're in a position to make it a big-time game.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Green hurt his right foot during a 37-34 win over Tampa Bay heading into the bye.\n\nGreen wore a protective boot last week and was sent for an exam by a specialist. Coach Marvin Lewis said Monday afternoon that the receiver won't need surgery, but he gave no indication of when he might be able to play again.\n\nThe Bengals (5-3) will likely be missing their most indispensable receiver heading into a game Sunday against the Saints (7-1) at Paul Brown Stadium.\n\n\"Obviously it puts a lot of pressure on us as individuals because we know what he brings to the table,\" tight end C.J.

When the Bengals need the big catch at the end of a close game, Green is Andy Dalton's top choice. His touchdown catch with 7 seconds left gave the Bengals a 37-36 win over the Falcons on Sept. 30. During the win over the Buccaneers, Green had catches of 23 and 11 yards that moved the Bengals in range for Randy Bullock's 44-yard field goal on the final play. Green hurt his foot on the final catch.\n\nCincinnati's offense has been depleted by injuries to its tight ends \u2014 Tyler Eifert is out for the season with a broken ankle \u2014 and injuries to both running backs. Joe Mixon missed two games after knee surgery, and Giovani Bernard has missed the past four games with a knee injury.\n\nNow, they have to get by without Green.\n\n\"Hopefully through that time, whether it's this week or next week or whenever, we've got an opportunity to grow and get better with other people,\" Lewis said.\n\nGreen is always the focus of opposing defenses. Tyler Boyd has benefited from a lot of single coverage this season and leads the team with 49 catches, four more than Green. Now the Saints and other teams can focus more on him and the running backs.\n\n\"From a perspective of looking at their defense, it'll change some of the ways they roll,\" Uzomah said. \"A lot of teams account for A.J., obviously, so we'll expect that they'll have something different lined up for us.\"\n\nThe Bengals trail the Pittsburgh Steelers (5-2-1) for the AFC North lead. They're in the most favorable stretch of their schedule, playing the second of four home games during a five-game span. They play at Baltimore (4-5) the following week.\n\nThe Steelers beat the Ravens 23-16 on Sunday and host Carolina on Thursday night. The Saints knocked off the previously unbeaten Rams 45-35 for their seventh straight victory .\n\nGIO, ROSS BACK\n\nBernard returned to practice on Monday, a sign he's getting close to returning.

(AP) \u2014 In a jubilant locker room deep within Arrowhead Stadium, a young man impeccably dressed who looked as if he'd stepped out of a college classroom greeted Chiefs wide receiver Sammy Watkins with a brilliant smile and an enthusiastic high-five.\n\nWatkins had just had another standout performance in another Chiefs win, and Brett Veach no doubt felt a bit of satisfaction that his much-panned free-agent acquisition was paying such dividends.\n\nThen again, just about everything the Chiefs general manager does these days turns out all right.\n\nHis draft picks are thriving. His free-agent pickups have worked out brilliantly. And his myriad moves to cultivate depth and competition throughout the roster have allowed the Chiefs to not only deal with significant injuries but also race to an 8-1 start and take a stranglehold on the AFC West.\n\n\"Brett is very, very thorough and always prepared for whatever the scenario is, whether it's the draft or free agency or just working the roster on a week-to-week basis,\" Chiefs owner Clark Hunt said recently. \"He and Andy (Reid) work well together and that's an important part of the equation.\"\n\nIndeed, when Reid was hired as the Chiefs coach it was with the understanding that he would no longer handle the GM duties that bogged him down in Philadelphia. So, Hunt hired John Dorsey away from the Packers front office, and one of his top lieutenants was one of Reid's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s from Philly.\n\nVeach had joined him there when he was not yet 30, the former Delaware standout taking an entry level job on Reid's staff. But he quickly impressed everyone in the organization with his detail, work ethic and acumen, and he rose through the ranks before joining the front office in Kansas City.\n\nWhen the decision came last summer to part with Dorsey, Veach was a somewhat unexpected choice.\n\nBut despite taking the reins on the eve of training camp, he nevertheless put his fingerprints on a roster that would win the division title. He traded for former first-round draft pick Cam Ervin, who now starts on the offensive line, and for Reggie Ragland, who now starts at linebacker.\n\nHe made a series of moves deeper down the depth chart, too, seemingly never taking a break.\n\nVeach continued to make aggressive roster moves after the season, dealing away quarterback Alex Smith for cornerback Kendall Fuller and a draft pick and turning the job over to Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe moves have paid off in every way possible: Mahomes is off to a record-setting start to his career, the Chiefs created some much-needed salary cap space, Fuller has been their best cornerback and the third-round pick they acquired has turned into more help for their rebuilt defense.\n\nYes, even Veach's draft picks have paid off.\n\nHe was without a first-round selection in April because of the trade to select Mahomes last year, but he nevertheless moved adroitly around the draft board to acquire players he liked.\n\nSecond-round pick Breeland Speaks has started at outside linebacker with Justin Houston hurt, and defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi and linebacker Dorian O'Daniel have been regulars as third-round picks. Safety Armani Watts was pushing for a starting job before landing on injured reserve earlier this year and sixth-round pick Tremon Smith has been a special teams standout.\n\n\"Going back to last year,\" Hunt said, \"I was impressed with the short amount of time that he had to make some changes going into the 2017 season that ultimately really had an impact. That wasn't something I was expecting. And Brett's now had a full offseason, a draft and free agency, and he's made a lot of moves, and I think we're seeing the fruit of his labor this year.\"\n\nIt's not just the moves Veach has made, either. He's also shown patience to stand pat when nothing suits his liking, such as he did when the trade deadline passed without a peep.\n\n\"He's not going to do something just to do it to appease. He's going to do what's best for the Chiefs and he's really good about that,\" Reid said. \"That's just where he's at.\"\n\nSo far his best has been nearly perfect.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: University of Chicago)\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 A surge in early voting totals in key states across the nation suggests that 2018 could be the year that young people finally show up for a midterm election.\n\nFor decades, older voters have dominated the electorate in non-presidential years. But early and absentee voting among youth aged 18 to 29 has increased dramatically in several states with hotly contested races \u2013 including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada and Texas \u2013 compared to the 2014 midterm races.\n\nEarly youth voting in Illinois is up 144 percent over the 2014 midterms. More than 70 percent of the 6,200 undergraduates at the University of Chicago registered to vote through the TurboVote app. At the university\u2019s early voting site, students waited up to an hour to cast their ballots.\n\nFirst-time voter Eric You, 18, spent Halloween dropping bags of candy at the doors of fellow University of Chicago students that included a very millennial-worded reminder: Don\u2019t ghost the vote.\n\nYou, a member of the university\u2019s non-partisan UChi Votes initiative, said his motivation is simple.\n\n\u201cI want there to be a check on this president,\u201d You said.\n\nIf the early youth voting trend holds up, it could bolster Democrats\u2019 chance of picking up the 23 seats they need to take control of the House and win several gubernatorial races, according to a Harvard University Institute of Politics poll published last week. Polls suggest Republicans could add to their 51 to 49 margin in the Senate.\n\nForty percent of the young voters responding said they would \"definitely vote\" in the midterms, the Harvard poll found. Fifty-four percent of Democrats indicated a high likelihood of voting; 43 percent of Republicans indicated a high likelihood.\n\nLess than 20 percent of young people bothered to vote in 2014. That was half the rate of the general population.\n\nEarly voting data ahead of Election Day suggests that this year could be different.\n\nMore than 35 million Americans have already cast their midterm election ballots, a 75 percent increase over the roughly 20 million who cast ballots ahead of Election Day 2014.\n\nMore than 70% of #UChicago undergrads have signed up to register to vote via @TurboVote, the most of any school \u2014 over 30% higher than the second-highest university.#UChiVotes: https://t.co/wIOwH5ozq6pic.twitter.com/DW5pOGH2Uz \u2014 UChicago (@UChicago) November 5, 2018\n\nNationally, voters aged 18 to 39 have nearly tripled their early voting rate since 2014. That's increased their share of the early vote by more than 3 percentage points.\n\nThe early voting share of voters aged 50 to 64, meanwhile, has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points. The share of those 65 and older has fallen nearly 5 points.\n\nIn Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams is looking to become the first black female governor in the nation\u2019s history, youth voters cast nearly 215,000 ballots as of Saturday \u2013 a 362 percent increase over the same point in the 2014 election, according to TargetSmart, a Democratic political data services firm.\n\nMore: Trade wars, taxes, immigration among top economic issues for voters in midterm elections\n\nMore: What's at stake in the midterms?

Dean Heller is locked in a close race with Democrat Rep. Jacky Rosen, young voters have cast more than 56,000 ballots, a 409 percent surge in early and absentee voting.\n\nNearly 300,000 young Floridians cast early ballots, a 111 percent increase over the 2014 turnout.\n\nThe state has two marquee races. For governor, polls show Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum has a slight edge over Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis. The seat is currently held by Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nFor the Senate, polls show Scott closely trailing Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson.\n\nVoters in the Sunshine State are younger, more racially diverse and less likely to belong to a political party than in any time in recent decades, a USA TODAY Network analysis found.\n\nSeventy-six percent of voters 65 or older are non-Hispanic whites. Just 50 percent of Florida voters under 30 are.\n\nYoung voters have made up about 6.8 percent of early voting and absentee voters in Florida. In 2014, they made up about 4.8 percent. The share of early voters 65 and older has fallen to 44.6 percent, down from 47.8 percent in 2014.\n\nSusan MacManus, a retired political science professor from the University of South Florida, predicted that young voters would decide the state's races. A large youth turnout would help Democrats; if they largely stay at home, Republicans will gain.\n\n\"They are going to make one person the winner,\" she said. \"Or they are going to make the other person the winner.\"\n\nThe number of people newly registered to vote in Arizona this year is more than double that of the last midterm election year, data from the secretary of state's office shows.\n\nThe youngest voting demographic, those aged 18 to 24, leads all other age groups in new voters registered since Jan. 1. Early voting among Arizona voters is up about 186 percent as of Friday compared to same point in 2014 midterm.\n\nIn Missouri, one of 13 states that does not allow early voting or casting an early ballot without a valid excuse, Democratic and Republican students at the flagship University of Missouri worked with a nonpartisan student lobbying group to register more than 2,000 students this fall.\n\nIn the Show Me State\u2019s most closely-watched contest, Democratic Sen.

(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Coach Bill Self isn't sure what to be expect when top-ranked Kansas steps on the floor for its first regular-season game of the season against No. 10 Michigan State on Tuesday night in the Champions Classic.\n\nThe Jayhawks were sloppy in a pair of easy exhibition wins. They have a new-look roster featuring a series of Division I transfers and high-profile recruits. And they're facing a team in the Spartans that will be a major upgrade over Division II schools Emporia State and Washburn.\n\nOne thing is certain: Self will be glad the focus on the Jayhawks is back on the court.\n\nRather than in the courts.\n\nHis program has been dragged through the mud the past six weeks as three officials linked to shoe company Adidas were convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for their roles in funneling money from the company to the families of recruits at Kansas, Louisville and its other partner schools. Power forward Silvio de Sousa, whose family was mentioned in the court documents and testimony, will be held out against the Spartans and for the foreseeable future as his eligibility is investigated.\n\nSelf and his staff have not been accused of any wrongdoing, nor has the school, which has maintained throughout the FBI investigation into college basketball corruption that it was merely a victim. But it nevertheless has cast a shadow over the school that has been difficult to shake.\n\nMaybe the bright lights of the Champions Classic will finally do it. The Jayhawks and Spartans open the season's traditional lid-lifting doubleheader in Indianapolis, while second-ranked Duke takes on fourth-ranked Kentucky in Tuesday's nightcap.\n\n\"I've studied them a little bit,\" Self said of the Spartans. \"It's totally different personnel on both sides. They always seem to play well against us. We'll have to play a lot better than what we have played. Hopefully we'll also raise our level that maybe we haven't seen yet, too, going there.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks may have a new-look lineup but they do have plenty of Division I experience.\n\nTheir leading scorer and rebounder during their exhibition wins was Dedric Lawson, a forward who transferred from Memphis along with his brother, K.J. Lawson. And one of their steadiest ball-handlers in their two games at Allen Fieldhouse was Charlie Moore, a transfer from California.\n\n\"I'm very excited to play against a top-10 team early in the season,\" Dedric Lawson said. \"I think it's a good time for us to see where we really stand collectively.\"\n\nFive-star prospects Quentin Grimes, Devon Dotson and David McCormack will also factor into whether the Jayhawks can make another Final Four run, but all of them will have to go through some growing pains.\n\nThat much was evident during the exhibition games.\n\n\"Moving it up to a Tuesday to start the season and having a game of this magnitude this early, I'm not sure it will be the best played, especially if you're playing with young kids,\" Self said. \"We are, and they have some young kids as well.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks do have some holdovers from last year, though, and they will no doubt rely on bruising big man Udoka Azubuike and springy guard Lagerald Vick against the Spartans.\n\n\"Our team is ready,\" Azubuike said. \"We just have to tighten up a lot of stuff. Overall I think we are ready as far as talent, and I know they will be ready too, so we have to attack.\"\n\nSelf has done an admirable job insulating his players from the off-the-court issues that could have become a distraction. But that task will almost certainly become easier once the ball is finally thrown up on Tuesday night and the regular season gets under way.\n\n\"It's the beginning of the season. The fans are excited, everyone wants to see what Kansas can do,\" Azubuike said. \"It's the first big, official game that we play in. I think the way we go into that game really helps us moving forward. The stage of the Champions Classic is close to the same stage as the Final Four. I told the younger guys we can't think too much. We just have to play our game.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY foreign correspondent Kim Hjelmgaard interviewed Zarif in Antalya, a resort town on Turkey\u2019s southwestern Mediterranean coast, where he was attending an economic conference. The transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nUSA TODAY: President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is re-imposing all the crushing economic penalties that were lifted by the Obama administration as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. Is Iran ready for this?\n\nZARIF: Well, the question is, is the international community ready for it because the current U.S. administration is essentially asking all members of the international community to violate international law. The U.S. is not, itself, only violating, it\u2019s asking others to violate, too, because you know when we agreed [to] the nuclear deal it was enshrined in a United Nations Security Council resolution. And the Security Council resolution, which was actually not only voted for by the United States, but sponsored by the United States, by the previous administration. The U.S. government called on all countries to help implement the resolution and not to do anything that would prevent its implementation.\n\nNow the United States, itself, is preventing the deal\u2019s implementation and asking other countries not to engage in economic transactions with us, which means preventing the implementation of the resolution, because the objective of the resolution was to normalize Iran\u2019s business relations with the rest of the world. So the United States is, in fact, punishing people and countries for observing international law and rewarding them for violating international law. Iran is used to U.S. sanctions. We\u2019ve had them for almost 39 years. We haven\u2019t had an easy history with the United States, but it did not start on November 4, 1979, [with the Iran hostage crisis]. It started long before that in 1953 [with a CIA -orchestrated plot that removed Iran\u2019s democratically elected prime minister]. Nevertheless, we are used to measures that were never legal, but this time they are exceptionally illegal.\n\nIran has 7,000 years of history. We\u2019ve lived through more difficult times. For eight years [the Iran-Iraq War], we lived through a war that was imposed on Iran and everybody supported the aggressor, [Iraq\u2019s] Saddam Hussein. The United States supported it, the Soviet Union supported him, the Europeans supported him. The Soviets gave him MiG [jet] fighters, the French gave him Mirage [jet] fighters, the Brits gave him Chieftain tanks, the American gave him AWACS reconnaissance, the Germans gave him chemical weapons, the Saudis gave him $70 billion worth of assistance.\n\nEverybody pitched in, Iran survived, and now, as at that time, we were isolated.\n\nBut the United States is isolated, too. You heard, yesterday [Nov. 2], the Europeans again made a statement against the sanctions. Whether the private businesses will go along, it\u2019s a different story, but the international communities [are] standing against these sanctions.\n\nUSA TODAY: Iranians may not be panicking [because of the sanctions]. They are not desperate [or on the verge of revolution, as sometimes characterized by the Trump administration]. But they are weary. And they are having trouble buying some [essential goods]. What do you say to average Iranians who are caught in the middle who just want to get on with living their lives?\n\nZARIF: They have every right to. On the essential goods, I disagree. The government is providing subsidies so that the necessities for peoples\u2019 lives will be provided at the previous prices , but nobody claims economic sanctions don\u2019t hurt. Economic sanctions always hurt, but they don\u2019t achieve the policy objectives they intend to achieve. Sometimes, they achieve exactly the opposite.\n\nWhat I would say to the average Iranian is that for us, talking to the United States was a taboo. We broke that taboo, we spoke to the United States, we had the longest negotiations with the United States. We reached an agreement with the United States, not a two-page agreement, but a 150-page agreement. And the United States decided to walk away from it. It wasn\u2019t our fault that the United States is not a reliable negotiating partner. It\u2019s a problem that the international community is facing. And the U.S. has not just walked away from the Iran deal: It walked away from the Paris climate-change deal [in June 2017]. It walked away from an arms-control agreement with Russia [the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, or INF, in October]. It walked away from NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement, re-branded as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, in September]. It walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership [a 12-nation trade deal, in January 2017]. It walked away from UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in October 2017). It walked away from the Human Rights Council [a UN body, in June.] Basically, there are rare exceptions where it hasn\u2019t walked away.\n\nSo this is the type of U.S. administration that we're dealing with and I'm sure the Iranian community, the Iranian population, while I understand that they are unhappy with the situation right now, can also understand that it's not the fault of the government, but it is because we have a rogue regime in Washington that doesn't live by any principle of international law.\n\nUSA TODAY: The Europeans have been insisting for months the nuclear deal can exist without U.S. participation. They\u2019ve come up with a concept called a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d This is a financial mechanism that somehow is going to ensure that trade between Europe and Iran carry on. Is this ultimately doomed to failure? After all, Washington is looking at this closely and saying whatever the Europeans come up with, we\u2019re not going to allow the sanctions to be avoided.\n\nZARIF: Here's the problem: The United States is exercising its economic power beyond the normal acceptable limits. Whenever you do that, you risk backlash. Now, this backlash is starting. It doesn\u2019t mean that [the special purpose vehicle] will succeed. There\u2019s no guarantee that it will, but it\u2019s a seed of a new international monetary system. In spite of the U.S.\u2019s overwhelming influence on the current international monetary system, people are fed up with the United States telling them what to do and what not to do. Simply fed up, and now you see between many countries, we\u2019re in Turkey right now, Turkey has financial arrangements with many countries, with us, Russia, with China, with Ukraine, with other countries in order to use our own currencies. We have that arrangement with many [nations].\n\nThe more the United States puts pressure on various countries, the so-called weaponization of U.S. economy or weaponization of the U.S. dollar, the more it does that, the more people around the world will take measures to avoid it. The special purpose vehicle is one measure specifically designed as the first step to deal with Iran\u2019s situation, but it\u2019s ultimate objective, as we\u2019ve heard from the Europeans, is not simply to insulate trade between Iran and Europe, or between Iran and its third-party partners, but in fact [for Europe] to insulate themselves from the pressure it faces from the United States.\n\nSo that's the seed of a new international reality, which may not bear fruit soon enough to address our concern, but it will be the beginning of a new phase of international economic relations.\n\nUSA TODAY: The United States is issuing oil waivers to eight countries. Are there other back channels and ways that Iran can continue to sell oil despite the sanctions?\n\nZARIF: Trump and his administration said they would bring Iranian oil exports to zero [because of the sanctions]. We said that was a dream that will never come true. \u2026 We have seen we were right. They were bluffing about this attempt to prevent Iran from selling oil. They know what the impact on the international economy would be and they\u2019ll never be able to do it, period. We have always had various ways of selling our oil and we will continue to have ways of selling our oil, and the United States will continue to fail to implement that policy.\n\nBut what the United States is promoting ... because when you do this, you promote corruption, you promote lack of transparency. People, countries, will continue to trade. What the United States is doing is preventing transparency, preventing open trade. If we cannot openly trade our commodities, if we cannot get what we want to get from open, transparent international transactions, we will not lie down and wait to die. We will do it. We will do it through whatever means that is necessary.\n\nUSA TODAY: The U.S. midterm elections: What is the best outcome for Iran? Is it as simple as Democratic gains are good for Iran because they could conceivably provide a check on Trump\u2019s agenda?\n\nZARIF: In one sentence, we\u2019re not pinning any hopes on [the midterm elections] or 2020. What distinguishes Iran from some U.S. clients in the region is we have survived not only in spite of the U.S. but against U.S. \u2026 Iran has been through Democratic and Republican administrations in the past. \u2026 All of them hostile. \u2026 We rely on ourselves.\n\nUSA TODAY: Trump has said he\u2019s willing to hold talks with President Hassan Rouhani, without pre-conditions. Your government up until this point has made it quite clear that you\u2019re not interested in doing that. Why? Isn\u2019t it always more fruitful to have diplomacy, to have talks rather than to retreat from diplomacy?\n\nZARIF: It is always useful to have diplomacy. And we\u2019re not just saying it, we exercise it. I sat down with [former Secretary of State John] Kerry after basically 37 years of no talks between Iran and United States at any level. And we did it at the highest diplomatic level. And then we spent two years, day and night, negotiating in one way or the other together, and we achieved positive results. We thought that that would show the value of diplomacy; that you cannot gain through any other means. But this administration does not believe in diplomacy. This administration believes in imposition.\n\nFor negotiations to succeed, for any negotiation to succeed, you do not need mutual trust. Because when you sit with an adversary or even a friend in international relations, you cannot simply trust; otherwise you don't need to negotiate with them. You will just tell them that I'll do this and that, you'll do this, and that will be end of the story. But you sit down, you write things on the paper, you sign them, or you have them adopted by the [UN] Security Council because you do not trust each other.\n\nBut while mutual trust is not a requirement to start negotiations, mutual respect is a requirement. And mutual respect starts with respecting yourself, respecting your signature, respecting your own word. You cannot say that two years down the road there is another administration, which might not respect the agreement of this administration. You cannot say that in a year-and-a-half, in two years, in three years, we will have a different administration. \u2026 And the fact of the matter is, usually in democracies, administrations that succeed each other are not friendly to the previous administration.\n\nFor somebody to simply say: \u2018I don\u2019t like it. I want to walk away from it because I believe I am powerful enough to do it. What is the guarantee that they won\u2019t do it again with the next agreement? [Trump] says it\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t ratified by Congress, that it was a personal agreement between President Obama and the Iranian government. I\u2019ll tell them that first of all it is included in the Security Council resolution. And the Security Council is not \u2026 although President Trump may consider that chamber as a room in the White House as he tried to do [in September, at the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly in New York], but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s an official organ of the United Nations. Even putting [a] Security Council resolution aside. The United States just walked out of a treaty ratified by the Senate: The 1955 treaty between Iran and the U.S. on which the International Court of Justice ordered the United States to stop some of the sanctions. The U.S. simply walked out of it because it didn\u2019t like the order of the court.\n\nUSA TODAY: If there was a different U.S. administration would Iran consider discussing for a new nuclear deal? Would Iran at least consider having exploratory discussions with the Trump administration?\n\nZARIF: We were in the same room, myself and [former] Secretary of State [Rex] Tillerson were in the same room and we did talk. But everybody else did too and everybody told him the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known commonly as the Iran nuclear deal] is a reasonable document, that this nuclear deal is a reasonable document. And three of the countries that were sitting around the table were the closest allies of the United States and have been for the past 70 years or so. And they told him: \u2018This is the best deal you can get.\u2019 And he simply said: \u2018I represent the president, who doesn\u2019t think so. So going into a room and sitting down with a representative of this administration to explore what? And I\u2019m not saying that we can\u2019t negotiate with this administration, so we will negotiate with the next administration. There has to be the foundations for a fruitful dialogue, it doesn't have to be the next administration. It has to be a new approach, a different approach. I mean, we never negotiated in a positive atmosphere. Actually, Iran and the United States have a lot of differences. So we negotiated in an atmosphere of difference, of difference of view, of difference of interest, of difference of perspective. But we did reach an agreement on the topic that we were focusing on.\n\nUSA TODAY: Is there any contact between your administration and the Trump administration?\n\nZARIF: No.\n\nUSA TODAY: For the forseeable future?\n\nZARIF: I can see some discussion on the humanitarian issues of prisoners in the foreseeable future. But for the time being that would be limited to that.\n\nUSA TODAY: Saudi Arabia. Does Iran feel somewhat vindicated for its view of Saudi Arabia given happened with the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi? Given indications that he was murdered either directly or indirectly with involvement from the Saudi state?\n\nZARIF: Unfortunately, a person has been murdered in a very brutal way. \u2026 Who provided $70 billion to Saddam Hussein? Who created the Taliban?Whose citizens were involved in the September 11 attacks? Who supported the Islamic State group in Syria? Who is bombing Yemeni civilians? Who abducted [Lebanon\u2019s prime minister] and kept him in captivity for three weeks? \u2026 I mean, look at these realities. The United States has been not only making the wrong choice but the West in general has been sending the wrong signal. Basically, literally, telling the Saudi royal family that you can get away with murder, and they really believed it and they thought they could get away with murder, because unfortunately, they have been getting away with murder in Yemen.\n\nUSA TODAY: Iran blames the U.S. for exasperating all sorts of issues across the Middle East region. If you flip that over, the U.S. says that Iran is spending billions of dollars to fund global terrorism and its nuclear program and is generally sowing discord and confusion around the Middle East. Do you accept that Iran is complicit in some of these various theaters around the region? Because it seems like you have two countries that are accusing each other of the acting badly in the region in similar ways.\n\nZARIF: We don't need to accuse each other because look at the facts. Who was behind Al-Qaeda? Who created Al-Qaeda? Tell me who. Was it Iran or was it the U.S. in order to fight the Soviets? Who supported Saddam Hussein? Was it Iran? When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, who had been supporting him for the last for the preceding eight years? Who supported the referendum in Kurdistan? . \u2026 Who is instigating ethnic problems inside Syria by allowing Kurds to take over Arab land just as foot soldiers for the United States, for the U.S. to have a foothold in the region? Who is supporting the war in Yemen, the killing of innocent people? Are we bombing innocent people in Yemen?\n\nThe fact of the matter is, put allegations aside, the fact of the matter is Saudi aircraft, most of which are American built, are dropping bombs on school buses [in Yemen]. Now, you do that to anybody and they defend themselves. People, I mean, Yemenis have fought with well-equipped armies with stones long before the [1979] Iranian revolution, and they defeated them. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia did not read history. They thought they could defeat the Yemenis in three weeks. We offered to the United States, I offered to [former U.S. Secretary of State] John Kerry the possibility of a ceasefire as soon as it started. The Saudi\u2019s rejected it and said that we can win militarily in three weeks time, just as they thought they could win militarily in Syria in three weeks time. Now it\u2019s seven years in Syria, almost four years in Yemen. The bloodshed continues. \u2026 Now, in Syria, who is behind the Astana Process [plan to resolve Syria\u2019s civil war]? Who is trying to bring the hostilities to an end? If anything, the United States is trying to prevent that. It is Iran, Russia, and Turkey working together against the U.S. and its allies. So just look at the realities. I\u2019m not making accusations. I\u2019m not calling this group a terrorist or the other group. I\u2019m simply using the available information based on [UN] Security Council resolutions. I don\u2019t sit in the Security Council. The Security Council, where the United States is a permanent member, considers [the Islamic State group], the Taliban, the Al Nusrah Front and Al-Qaeda to be [non-state] terrorist organizations. The rest are national designations. These four organizations are those who are considered globally, there is consensus about that. And the United States or its allies had either created them, financed them, armed them, continue to support them.\n\nUSA TODAY: Do you accept that your government finances terrorist groups in Syria, groups in Lebanon?\n\nZARIF: We are in Syria on the invitation of the Syrian government fighting terrorists who are on the United Nations list of terrorists, not on a self-serving U.S. list of terrorists. We are in Syria for the same reason we were in Iraqi Kurdistan. We went to Iraqi Kurdistan to help them defeat ISIS. We\u2019ve been consistent. Those we support in Lebanon are a part of the Lebanese government. We actually support the Lebanese government. We don\u2019t imprison the prime minister of Lebanon. The United States, instead of making all these self-serving allegations which are not self-serving really because they hurt U.S. interests, instead of making these allegations which serve only a few clients, Israel and Saudi Arabia, the United States should look at the reality. Who's bombing Yemen? Who's imprisoning another country's prime minister? Who is helping the Islamic State group? Who is helping Al Nusrah Front? Whose arms are in the hands of the Islamic State group? You've seen the reports that ISIS was using American arms provided by Saudi Arabia. These are the realities. These are not my allegations. These are realities. These groups are UN-designated groups, not US-designated groups. There is a difference, because the United States designates whoever it doesn't like as a terrorist. Let me tell you an example. It may be a historical example: In 1984, the United States removed Saddam Hussein as a state sponsor of terrorism. In the same year ,it put Iran on the list. You know why? Because the United States at that time wanted to go and support Saddam Hussein in the war against Iran. Don\u2019t expect me to consider the United States\u2019 list of terrorism designations to have any credibility if it removes Saddam Hussein from the list and puts Iran on the list.\n\nUSA TODAY: The Danish security services said they foiled a recent planned attack by an exiled Iranian dissident group. That came after a similar allegation in France. That followed another one in Finland. Iran disputes these allegations and claims they are politically motivated to put distance between Europe and Iran as they have tried to forge ahead with the nuclear deal without Washington. Why would France and Denmark do this? They have been very supportive of the nuclear deal.\n\nZARIF: We live in a world where complicated intelligence operations are the order of the day. What makes us different from those who make the allegations is that we've offered ... I spoke to the Danish foreign minister last night, and I offered to him that we are prepared to conduct a joint investigation, that we are prepared to send a high-level intelligence officer. Now, we're talking about facts and we're talking about allegations. Let's look at the facts first. France houses, provides safe haven to an organization that was on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations until 2012, and on the EU list of terrorist organizations until about the same time, MEK. Denmark provides safe haven and support to an organization and people who went on international television financed by Saudi Arabia operating out of London called Iran International claiming, not condoning, claiming responsibility for an operation that was conducted in Iran, an operation that the government of Denmark itself condemned as a terrorist operation.\n\n\n\nThese are facts on the ground. This gentleman in the Danish allegation is not an obscure face. It\u2019s not an alleged situation. This gentleman in person went on TV live, claimed responsibility for an operation that the government of Denmark considers and condemned as a terrorist operation. You have an organization in Paris that has been on the list of U.S. as well as Europe as a terrorist organization. These are facts. Now you have allegations. You have allegations that somebody connected with Iran tried to assassinate this person. Somebody connected with Iran tried to put explosives in that meeting that they had in Paris. These are allegations. Those are facts. If anybody should provide the explanation, it would be France and Denmark. Why are they giving refuge, safe haven to known terrorists? Why are they not prosecuting them? What we have done is we have officially asked both France and the United States to prosecute these people. We have asked the United Kingdom to look at the fact that there is a television station that is financed by Saudi Arabia that broadcasts live terrorist claims and applauds it. These are facts. The way we have approached these facts is through the legal means of telling them that you need to deal with it. Now, you have allegations. Just look at the chronology. On the day that our president arrives in Switzerland, Mossad [Israel\u2019s intelligence service] helps France and Belgium to foil that plot of a bomb attack against MEK. On the day Europe was supposed to announce the establishment of SPV [a financial mechanism intended to keep the nuclear deal alive between Iran and Europe], Denmark makes the announcement with the help of Mossad that they have arrested this person. What we do is we ask both of them let's look at this together. Let's investigate. Now, France has been forthcoming and that is why we are discussing this with France. I hope that Denmark will be forthcoming, because I offered this to the foreign minister of Denmark last night, and I hope that he will accept it. I hope that they will listen to serious intelligence, not to politically motivated intelligence.\n\nUSA TODAY: A lot of Americans may find it hard to accept that Iran\u2019s government is anything but a bad actor, whether that\u2019s regionally, whether that's on the world stage, or whether that's acting against your own people in terms of human rights abuses. What evidence can you point to proves that Iran is simply a normal country trying to look after its own interests, just like every other country?\n\nZARIF: I would ask them just to look at the facts. Why are we being blamed for situations where it\u2019s U.S. allies that are responsible? That\u2019s a fact. In our region, there is a great deal of suspicion about the United States. Anywhere you go you see that suspicion about U.S. interests, about U.S. intentions, objectives. I don't know how much of it is well-founded. I know that the perceptions about Iran in the United States are based on past experience, mostly the hostage crisis. That is taken also out of context of how the Iranians at that time perceived U.S. intentions in the context of what had happened in 1953 and in the coup d'\u00e9tat against the democratically elected government in Iran. One way to deal with that, one way to deal with that historical baggage that we all had was to start a new phase. I had hoped that the nuclear deal could prove that another type of interaction would be possible.\n\nWe had dealt with a difficult issue. Seemingly an issue that could not have been resolved diplomatically. Everybody was analyzing when this was would start between Iran and the United States. We reached a very good deal [the 2015 nuclear deal]. A very good deal that does not address all my concerns, doesn\u2019t address all American concerns. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good deal. If it addressed all my concerns, it would have been submission by the United States. Had it addressed all the U.S. concerns, it would have been submission by Iran. That's why it's not submission, it's a deal. I think and I thought that we could create a different example, to put aside the past. This administration proved that was not possible.\n\nUSA TODAY: Is there any way beyond this impasse between Iran and the United States?\n\nZARIF: We need a different approach.

But it takes an awfully long time for this spa treatment to take effect: More than 200 pages of character development pass before the action really begins.\n\nAnd these characters aren\u2019t particularly compelling. Frances, a blowsy romance novelist, is smarting from multiple rejections: Her publisher spurned her new book, she got an especially stinging review and she has been victimized by an online catfishing scheme that cost her dearly.\n\nMore: HBO's 'Big Little Lies' gets second season with Witherspoon, Kidman to return\n\nAuthor Liane Moriarty. (Photo: Uber Photography)\n\nTony is a beer-bellied former football star who encounters Frances mid-hot flash along the side of the road in a menopausal meet cute. Jessica is a social-media and plastic surgery-obsessed lottery winner, seeking marriage therapy with her mechanic husband Ben. Carmel is a single mom of four who was dumped for a younger woman by her bored hubby. Lars is a gorgeous gay divorce lawyer.\n\nThe most relatable, real characters are Heather and Napoleon and their daughter, Zoe, who have escaped to Tranquillum to endure the anniversary of the death of Zoe\u2019s twin, Zach.\n\nMore: This picture of Reese Witherspoon throwing an ice cream cone at Meryl Streep is sweet\n\nThe spa is run by Masha, a Russian emigre who fled the corporate world after a heart attack that left her briefly clinically dead. Masha resurrected her life, health and body, her once fleshy form now supermodel svelte.\n\nThe brusque Masha is all about results, so these nine strangers are in for daily blood tests, fasting, \u201cnoble silences,\u201d hikes at dawn and, oh yes, smoothies with a little extra something. As in, micro doses of LSD, monitored by Masha\u2019s besotted assistant, Yao, who was the fledgling EMT on duty the day she suffered her heart attack.\n\n\u201cStrangers\u201d evokes a potboiler more than the searing, sharp social commentary Moriarty has delivered in her previous page-turners. It\u2019s predictable, and the twisted turns that are signature Moriarty are visible miles ahead.\n\nNormally, I\u2019d say \u201cnamaste\u201d \u2013 I bow to you \u2013 Liane Moriarty, witty writer of of-the-moment plots populated by people we all know. But most of these \u201cStrangers\u201d are the types you\u2019d find at central casting.

Well, let's see if they can continue that kind of play.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets are off to a decent start behind the play of Kemba Walker, and in the wide-open Southeast Division, the Hornets have a shot.\n\nHow about the Sacramento Kings? Maybe it's possible Kings general manager Vlade Divac is onto something with his young team, and Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff is getting the most from a team that will play hard, especially defensively.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks 8-1\n\nThe Bucks were expected to be better with the continued development of 23-year-old All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo and new coach Mike Budenholzer, who figured to bring a more dynamic offense and improved defense. That has happened and manifested itself in improved three-point shooting, and the play of Khris Middleton, who is averaging 19.2 points and shooting 49.3 percent on three-pointers and making a push for his first All-Star appearance.\n\nMORE: Lakers' maddening play continues in a loss to Raptors\n\nMORE: Warriors' Steph Curry on record pace again ... 500 3s possible?\n\nMORE: Antetokounmpo nets triple double in dominating victory\n\nMilwaukee made 8.8 threes per game last season and is at league-best 15.6 per game through Sunday. Milwaukee has the NBA\u2019s No. 2 defense, allowing 100.1 points per 100 possessions, and the No. 3 offense, scoring 114.7 points per 100 possessions for a league-best plus-14.6 net rating.\n\nSacramento Kings 6-4\n\nThe guffaws reverberated throughout the league in the summer when Divac called his squad a \u201csuper team, just young.\u201d Divac might be on to something with De\u2019Aaron Fox (18.6 points per game), Buddy Hield (19.7 ppg), Willie Cauley-Stein (15.7 ppg, 8.2 rebounds per game), Marvin Bagley III (12.8 ppg, 6.8 rpg), Justin Jackson and Harry Giles. The Kings have nice victories against Oklahoma City, Memphis and Miami, and the young core looks promising. Fox\u2019s 31-point, 15-assist, 10-rebound night makes him the youngest ever with a 30-15-10 triple double. The addition of Nemanja Bjelica provides even more three-point shooting alongside Hield, who is shooting 48 percent on threes.\n\nCharlotte Hornets guard Kemba Walker.

A free agent following this season, Walker is going for all the money. His play under first-year coach James Borrego could have the Hornets in the heart of the Southeast Division race. Second-year guard Malik Monk has shown improvement, and former Spurs guard Tony Parker is a perfect veteran addition for Charlotte. Rookie Miles Bridges can play coming off a deep bench. Charlotte has the No. 2 offense, scoring 115.1 points per 100 possessions. Charlotte also is 12th defensively.\n\nDenver Nuggets 8-1\n\nDenver entered the season on the rise given its talent (Nikola Jokic, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap). No one expected a start that includes victories over Golden State and Utah. It\u2019s another team with a deep roster. Coach Mike Malone has a fluid rotation depending on situations, and 11 players get at least 17 minutes per game. Jokic, the super-skilled 7-footer, averages 18 points, 10 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 blocks, and Harris is one of the league\u2019s best two-way shooting guards averaging 18.9 points. Denver has the third-best net rating in the league, behind Milwaukee and Golden State. It will be interesting to see how they hold up during at tougher schedule for the next month.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies 5-3\n\nCoach J.B. Bickerstaff, who got the full-time job after handling interim duties most of last season, has the Grizzlies playing strong defense (fourth in the NBA). Though the Grizzlies are trying to get younger players some minutes, Marc Gasol and Mike Conley remain productive and influential veterans, and Garrett Temple has been a valuable addition.

Players will be able to get NFL team outfits in the game\u2019s Battle Royale item shop beginning Friday. Once a player gets a uniform for any one NFL team, they can customize it with a jersey number each time they use it \u2013 and swap it out for a different team\u2019s helmet, jersey pants and cleats. So if for one game you are wearing New England Patriots gear, the next you\u2019ll be able to suit up as the Green Bay Packers without having to purchase a new uniform pack.\n\nThe announcement video features characters dressed in the uniforms of all 32 teams dancing and no actual gameplay\u2026\n\nWe are gearing up for something big. #FortniteNFL \ud83c\udfc8\ud83c\udfae \ud83c\udfc8\ud83c\udfae NFL-themed @FortniteGame outfits available in-game November 9 7pm ET pic.twitter.com/2emN0qneA7 \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 5, 2018\n\nThat decision probably has something to do with the fact that the objective of Fortnite is basically kill or be killed, with an emphasis on \u201ckill.\u201d Like with guns.

It\u2019s just a video game, after all. But that does seem like a thing the NFL would definitely have a problem with. Gamers will be able to dress their characters up in NFL uniforms starting Nov. 9 at 7:00 p.m. ET, which means you can expect videos of characters wearing No. 81 Patriots or No. 32 Bills jerseys mowing people down by 7:05.\n\nWhy the NFL, a league that strongarmed ESPN into canceling Playmakers, a show about a fictitious pro football team employing players with various off-the-field problems, and fines its players for weapon-based celebrations, would agree to this makes little sense. Well, until you realize Fortnite will charge gamers about $15 for the feature, and the league potentially stands to make millions from the sales (terms of the NFL\u2019s deal with Epic haven\u2019t been disclosed).\n\nThe difference is Playmakers wasn\u2019t making the league any money.

The Rangers formally introduced Woodward, the Dodgers third base coach, as their new manager Monday, just more than a week after Los Angeles lost in the World Series for the second year in a row. Texas had been the last team to do that, in 2010 and 2011. (AP Photo/Stephen Hawkins) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Chris Woodward grew up wanting to be an architect or an engineer. He also had what he thought was a far-fetched dream of playing professional baseball.\n\nThe kid from California who was a 54th-round draft pick and went on to play 12 major league seasons as a utility infielder for five teams is now the manager of one of the youngest teams in the majors. The Texas Rangers formally introduced Woodward as their new manager Monday, two days after hiring the Los Angeles Dodgers third base coach.\n\n\"I share a common bond with most Rangers fans right now. This has actually taken away the sting of losing two World Series in a row,\" Woodward said. \"A lot of Rangers fans, obviously I feel your pain, it's real, I get it. ... I know how to get to the World Series. I'm going to instill a philosophy and a belief and a process in place to get us to that point.\"\n\nWoodward's introduction as a first-time big league manager came just more than a week after the Dodgers lost in the World Series for the second year in a row. Texas had been the last team to do that, in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe Rangers are coming off consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 2005-08. They lost 95 games this year when the focus turned the development of younger players \u2014 seven position players 25 or younger played at least 106 games.\n\n\"Ideally what we're putting in place here is the beginning of the foundation of a championship belief and culture,\" Woodward said. \"I don't know how many wins we're going to have next year but that championship belief, I believe, is powerful and it's important to instill in these younger players now.\"\n\nGeneral manager Jon Daniels described the 42-year-old Woodward as an \"energetic, winning manager to help us drive the culture here at the major league level. We're all going to grow together, we're all going to win together.\"\n\nDaniels said the Rangers met with or spoke by phone with about 15 candidates after Jeff Banister was fired Sept. 21. Texas won AL West titles in Banister's first two seasons (2014 and 2015).\n\nAs a player, Woodward spent parts of 12 seasons (1999-2011) with Toronto, the New York Mets, Seattle, Atlanta and Boston. He hit .239 with 33 home runs and 191 RBIs while playing every position except pitcher and catcher. Woodward said he played for 11 different managers during his career, several of them first-year managers. He also played for Bobby Cox one season in Atlanta.\n\nHis coaching career began as a minor league infield coordinator for the Mariners in 2013 and he joined their big league staff later that year. He spent the past three seasons on Dave Roberts' staff in Los Angeles.\n\nWoodward said he wants to create a culture where players can learn and grow every single day. He said that is what he will place the most value on moving forward.\n\n\"Process is a big one for me, I don't like to think of results,\" he said. \"I think young kids, young players nowadays, they get caught up in results. ... I want to drive home the process that's going to get them the results.\"\n\nWoodward said he had to fight every day as a \"very average, probably below average\" player and has always had that same kind of energy as a coach. He said it important to relate that to players.\n\nThe new manager will wear No. 8, and donned that jersey Monday for the first time in the big leagues. Yes, he was a fan of Cal Ripken Jr. growing up. But that was also the number of Woodward's high school coach Tom Quinley, a Yankees fan who revered Yogi Berra (who also wore No. 8).\n\n\"He passed away this past season, and it was very emotional for me,\" Woodward said. \"He took the role of many things for me, obviously as a mentor, as a father figure. He did everything for me. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him. ... It's pretty special to me, and obviously in honor of him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Players will be able to get NFL team outfits in the game\u2019s Battle Royale item shop beginning Friday. Once a player gets a uniform for any one NFL team, they can customize it with a jersey number each time they use it \u2013 and swap it out for a different team\u2019s helmet, jersey pants and cleats. So if for one game you are wearing New England Patriots gear, the next you\u2019ll be able to suit up as the Green Bay Packers without having to purchase a new uniform pack.\n\nThe announcement video features characters dressed in the uniforms of all 32 teams dancing and no actual gameplay\u2026\n\nWe are gearing up for something big. #FortniteNFL \ud83c\udfc8\ud83c\udfae \ud83c\udfc8\ud83c\udfae NFL-themed @FortniteGame outfits available in-game November 9 7pm ET pic.twitter.com/2emN0qneA7 \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 5, 2018\n\nThat decision probably has something to do with the fact that the objective of Fortnite is basically kill or be killed, with an emphasis on \u201ckill.\u201d Like with guns. So, yeah, the NFL seems to be totally fine with characters dressed in official team uniforms running around shooting each other to death.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t personally have a problem with that. It\u2019s just a video game, after all. But that does seem like a thing the NFL would definitely have a problem with. Gamers will be able to dress their characters up in NFL uniforms starting Nov. 9 at 7:00 p.m. ET, which means you can expect videos of characters wearing No. 81 Patriots or No. 32 Bills jerseys mowing people down by 7:05.\n\nWhy the NFL, a league that strongarmed ESPN into canceling Playmakers, a show about a fictitious pro football team employing players with various off-the-field problems, and fines its players for weapon-based celebrations, would agree to this makes little sense. Well, until you realize Fortnite will charge gamers about $15 for the feature, and the league potentially stands to make millions from the sales (terms of the NFL\u2019s deal with Epic haven\u2019t been disclosed).\n\nThe difference is Playmakers wasn\u2019t making the league any money. Nor was Josh Norman pretending to shoot a bow-and-arrow after an interception. This partnership with Fortnite will make the league a whole lot of cash, so please do enjoy shooting up the competition in your favorite NFL team\u2019s gear starting next week!", "FILE - In this Aug. 5, 2017 file photo, St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher Trevor Rosenthal (44) throws against the Cincinnati Reds during the ninth inning of a baseball game in Cincinnati.

No hiccups. I felt really good the whole time. Almost too good,\" Rosenthal said Monday during a conference call with reporters. \"Especially there, after the All-Star break, I was kind of anxious, thinking I might be able to pitch before the season was over. But the plan all along from my doctor was just to take this year off, so we stuck with that plan.\"\n\nRosenthal, the former St. Louis Cardinals closer, agreed last week to a deal with the Nationals, who officially announced Saturday that they signed him.\n\nHe joins holdover lefty closer Sean Doolittle at the back of Washington's bullpen.\n\nRosenthal said he hasn't \"really had too many conversations\" yet with the Nationals about how they plan to use him.\n\n\"Obviously, I mean, I think the plan is just being in high-leverage situations and hopefully, as a team, we're winning a lot of games and have a lot of those opportunities to go around,\" he said. \"But for me, it's not something where I need to know exactly what my role is going to be.\"\n\nRosenthal also said he doesn't think there will be any sort of \"hard stop or exact limitations to what I'm going to do,\" in terms of number of innings or appearances as he returns from the reconstructive elbow surgery.\n\nIn Washington, he'll be reunited with Nationals pitching coach Derek Lilliquist, who used to hold that position with the Cardinals.\n\nThe Nationals gave Rosenthal a 2019 contract that guarantees him $7 million and gives the righty a chance to earn an additional $8 million in performance bonuses. The agreement includes a $15 million conditional player option for 2020 that kicks in if Rosenthal appears in 50 games next year or has 30 games finished.\n\nThe 28-year-old Rosenthal is a hard-thrower with 121 career saves, all for the Cardinals, including a career-high 48 in 2015, when he was an NL All-Star. He had 45 saves in 2014.\n\nHe had only 14 saves in 2016, and 11 in 2017 before getting injured. Rosenthal was released by the Cardinals in November 2017, a few months after his operation.\n\n\"By the time I started throwing, I was really chomping at the bit to get back into it. And I had done so much exercises and rehabilitation work that my arm probably felt the best it's felt in the past five or six years,\" Rosenthal said. \"So I was excited to try it out \u2014 and also kind of let down when I did do my first throwing session and I realized that I was only allowed to throw it a maximum of 40 feet and for only so many throws. I was like, 'Really? That was it?' I'm used to throwing really hard for an extended amount of time, every single day.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Orange, who easily beat both Division II teams, open the season Tuesday night at home against Eastern Washington.\n\n\"We won't know anything until probably right about game time,\" Boeheim said. \"At least now we've had two games ... with Tyus handling the ball and doing stuff. That's good for us. We'll see who's ready.\"\n\nSyracuse defeated crosstown rival Le Moyne last Wednesday, getting a team-high 21 points from East Carolina transfer Elijah Hughes. Battle finished with 13 points, five assists and zero turnovers as four players scored in double figures in the 89-52 victory.\n\nThe Orange defeated Saint Rose 77-45 in their exhibition opener on Oct. 25, when Hughes and Boeheim's son, Buddy, each scored 19. Battle had only seven points on 1-for-10 shooting and assisted on six baskets with two turnovers.\n\n\"These games hurt us a little bit because we're playing out of position, so I think it has a little less value from that standpoint,\" Boeheim said. \"Tyus is much better when he is off the ball and can make his plays. When he's doing the point, it's just not the same.\n\n\"It's hard to make that switch. He's always been a scoring guard. When he gets his opportunities, he's got to get to the basket.\"\n\nHoward is nursing an ankle injury and is out of the walking boot he was wearing in mid-October, but he's doubtful for the opener. Carey is recovering from a sprained ankle he suffered in the Orange's camp-opening scrimmage just over two weeks ago, while Washington is close to returning from surgery on torn ligaments in his right knee, which he suffered during practice last January.\n\nThe season-ending injury to Washington came after the best game of his freshman season \u2014 nine points and three rebounds in a double overtime loss at No. 23 Florida State.

The departure of the conference's all-time leading scorer, Bogdan Bliznyuk, who was the league MVP, leaves a big void. He finished his career with 2,169 points.\n\nAs for the Orange, the staff expects big things right from the opening tip.\n\n\"We're in a good state of mind,\" assistant coach Gerry McNamara said. \"We have the right pieces. We're as deep as we've been in a long time. We're in a good position. We just have to make sure that we come together and play selflessly.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee concluded there \"was no evidence to substantiate any of the claims\" of sexual misconduct leveled against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a report released over the weekend.\n\nKavanaugh's initial Senate hearings were contentious, with Democrats working to expose what they felt were his more extreme views and accusing Republicans of withholding relevant documents. But he seemed headed for certain confirmation when reports began to surface accusing the nominee of a decades-old sexual assault.\n\nWhen psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford came forward publicly with her allegation, a furious national debate erupted. Already thunderous partisan divisions exploded and intertwined with the social upheaval of the #MeToo movement to create a storm of outrage across the political spectrum.\n\nThe furor persuaded Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to hold another hearing in which Ford could share her allegation and Kavanaugh could respond. The Sept. 27 hearing and ensuing media circus captured national attention.\n\nAfter Ford came forward, other accusations of misconduct against Kavanaugh began to surface, but their credibility appeared increasingly shaky.\n\n\"The revelation of last-minute allegations tested the committee in many ways. But these investigative efforts rose to the occasion and were critical to helping us obtain the truth,\" Grassley said in a statement with the release of the report. \"In the end, there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against the nominee.\"\n\nAfter Kavanaugh was confirmed on Oct. 6, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hailed the effort to stop Kavanaugh's confirmation \"certainly had a good impact\" for Republicans ahead of the midterm elections and said because of the left's tactics, \"our base is fired up.\"\n\nDemocrats also claimed Kavanaugh's confirmation energized their supporters.\n\nNow, a detailed look at the allegations and the committee's investigation has landed just days ahead of the 2018 election to determine the next two years of congressional control.\n\nHere are some highlights from the 414-page report, which included interviews with 45 people and 25 written statements.\n\nMore: USA TODAY/Suffolk poll: There is a 'Kavanaugh effect,' and it boosts Democrats more than the GOP in midterms\n\nMore: What's at stake in the midterms?

Dianne Feinstein, on July 30.\n\nAccording to the report, Feinstein kept the letter to herself until Sept. 12, when she shared it with other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Intercept reported on the letter's existence the same say. On Sept. 14, a New Yorker article detailed Ford's allegation but she remained anonymous, and on Sept. 16, Ford came forward publicly in a Washington Post article.\n\nAccording to the report, Grassley did not learn of Ford's identity until the Post article ran.\n\nFord 'refused' to hand over evidence\n\nThe committee said it collected 24 pages of evidence from Ford. That evidence consisted of her resume, her text messages with the Post, her letter to Feinstein, her communications with the Judiciary Committee, declarations from Ford's husband and three friends that she had previously mentioned \"an incident of sexual assault\" and a summary of the results of a polygraph test.\n\nThe committee report said it requested the full polygraph test along with audio or video recordings of the exam, but Ford \"refused\" to give them to the committee along with the notes from a therapy session about a past sexual assault that she shared with reporters.\n\nFord polygraph exam consisted of two questions\n\nAccording to the Judiciary Committee report, Ford and her attorney, Debra Katz, gave the polygraph examiner a written statement they had prepared. After an interview, the examiner then asked Ford two questions: \"Is any part of your statement false?\" and \"Did you make up any part of your statement?\"\n\n\"Dr. Ford answered no to both questions. The examiner concluded that the test results did not indicate deception,\" the report said.\n\nWitness said Mark Judge described group sex encounter\n\nElizabeth Rasor said she dated Kavanaugh's high school friend Mark Judge, whom Ford said was present during her alleged assault, several years after the incident was said to take place.\n\nRasor said Judge told her, \"in a voice that seemed to convey a degree of shame, about an incident that had occurred a few years prior, where he and several other boys from Georgetown Prep took turns having sex with a woman who was drunk.\" Rasor said she couldn't say whether or not Judge said Kavanaugh was present and that Judge described the incident as consensual.\n\n'No verifiable evidence'\n\nThe conclusion of the report's sections on Ford's allegation says, \"Committee investigators found no verifiable evidence that supported Dr. Ford\u2019s allegations against Justice Kavanaugh. The witnesses that Dr. Ford identified as individuals who could corroborate her allegations failed to do so, and in fact, contradicted her.\"\n\nAnother member of Kavanaugh's frat often exposed himself\n\nDeborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged he \"exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away,\u201d according to a New Yorker magazine article Sept. 23.\n\nKavanaugh denied the allegation in a committee interview Sept. 25, saying \"that did not happen.\" Several named witnesses praised either Kavanaugh or Ramirez. The behavior would have been out of character for Kavanaugh, but Ramirez was also trustworthy, witnesses said.\n\nThe committee report cited an unnamed witness who said another member of the same fraternity DKE often exposed himself at Yale parties. The report described a photograph from the 1988 Yale Banner yearbook of the same man \"with his pants down and his genitals exposed.\"\n\nAs with Ford, the committee concluded there was \"no verifiable evidence to support Ramirez\u2019s allegations.\"\n\nFalse or misleading testimony\n\nJulie Swetnick submitted a sworn statement to the panel Sept. 26 through her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, that alleged Kavanaugh would \"cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped' in a side room or bedroom by a 'train' of numerous boys\" during the early 1980s while students were in high school or college.\n\nKavanaugh vehemently denied the charges, which he called a \"farce\" and a \"circus,\" during a committee hearing on Sept. 28.\n\nThe committee report quoted a handful of unnamed witnesses who questioned Swetnick\u2019s credibility. Two men who had relationships with her \u2013 Dennis Ketterer and Richard Vinneccy \u2013 said she never mentioned Kavanaugh or being the victim of sexual assault.\n\nThe report concluded that there not only was not enough evidence to back Swetnick's claims, it also appeared that \"Julie Swetnick and Mr. Avenatti criminally conspired to make materially false statements to the Committee and obstruct the Committee\u2019s investigation.\"\n\nGrassley asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the FBI on Oct. 25 to investigate.\n\nAvenatti welcomed further investigation and chided Grassley in a tweet Monday for the lack of action.\n\n\"Another week has gone by and still NOTHING has happened on your BS request for a criminal investigation,\" Avenatti tweeted. \"Are you this incompetent?\"\n\n.@ChuckGrassley - another week has gone by and still NOTHING has happened on your BS request for a criminal investigation. Are you this incompetent? And how about your ridiculous report where you claim there is \u201cevidence\u201d but then provide none. Where\u2019s the beef Chuck? #Pathetic \u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) November 5, 2018\n\nThree more suspect allegations\n\nThere were three more accusations the committee report found not to be credible. One accuser recanted his story almost as soon as it became public and the committee referred him to the FBI.\n\nThe second involved an anonymous letter that alleged Kavanaugh \"very aggressively and sexually\" pushed a woman he was dating against a wall. U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich, whom Kavanaugh dated at the time in question, called the story \"offensive and absurd.\"\n\nOn Sept. 25, the panel received a letter from a \"Jane Doe\" who said Kavanaugh raped her.\n\nKentucky resident Judy Munro-Leighton later took responsibility for the letter, but the committee \"quickly concluded that Munro-Leighton was unlikely to be the author.\" Last week, Munro-Leighton admitted she was not Jane Doe and said her claim \"was just a ploy\" to \"get attention, according to the report.\n\nOn Friday, Grassley referred Munro-Leighton to the Department of Justice for investigation.\n\n'I was angry and I sent it': Another Kavanaugh accuser referred to FBI after recanting\n\nMore: Trump tweets indignation after bit player in Kavanaugh saga recants allegations\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/05/brett-kavanaugh-allegations-report/1889770002/", "Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2018: Everything you need to know about the sexy affair\n\nCLOSE Only one model gets to wear the Victoria's Secret Fantasy bra, and this year, Elsa Hosk is the lucky lady.

(Photo: ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhere do you go after you've been at the top and fallen to the depths?\n\nMegyn Kelly, just fired from NBC's \"Today\" show, is probably asking herself that question now \u2013 and finding that her options are limited despite the explosive expansion of the media world she inhabits.\n\n\"She's an anchorwoman-without-portfolio and without a home \u2013 she's stateless now,\" says Mark Feldstein, a broadcast journalism professor at the University of Maryland who spent two decades in TV news for ABC, CNN and local news stations.\n\n\"She may be fine (financially) with all the money she's saved, but there are not a lot of options for her, and I'm sure they're very unappealing options for someone with the money and visibility she's used to having.\"\n\nNo other mainstream news network is likely to take her, and her previous home at Fox News is not interested. She could move to Fox Nation, the network's new streaming service launching Nov. 27, or to the Sinclair Broadcast Group, the emerging conservative network of local TV stations. She could host a new syndicated show tailored to her particular personality or follow the example of her former Fox colleague, Bill O'Reilly, and go straight to the internet with an online show.\n\nShe could even go back to being a lawyer. Or she could go home with millions and write another score-settling memoir about how she ended up in this predicament. No matter what, these options probably would be seen as big steps down for her.\n\nStill, it's hard to imagine Kelly simply fading away \u2013 not after her years bathed in the ego-stroking glow of the media spotlight.\n\nKelly on her show \"Megyn Kelly Today\" on Oct. 22, 2018, the day before controversial remarks led to the show being canceled and negotiations for her departure from NBC News. (Photo: Nathan Congleton/NBC via AP)\n\n\"Once they (media stars) get a taste of TV, they're like vampires \u2013 they can't go back to anonymity. Their psyches won\u2019t allow it,\" Feldstein says.\n\nJudy Muller, a longtime former ABC correspondent who is now a journalism professor emerita at the University of Southern California, says that for TV people, ego and professional prestige often outweigh mere money.\n\n\"But just going home and retiring? It's not in the cards,\" Muller predicts of Kelly. \"The good news for (her) is that there are so many more (news) outlets than there used to be. It's going to be humbling no matter what she does.\"\n\nRobert Thompson, head of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University and a veteran pop culture tracker, acknowledges the vastly expanded media universe but still believes Kelly's options are \"really, really limited\" given that her previously upward career trajectory is likely to be perceived as halted if not reversed.\n\n\"The question becomes, where do you go that is not seen as a plummet from where you were headed,\" Thompson says. \"I think the way Megyn Kelly has to contextualize this is: I\u2019m fine with what will be perceived as backward and downward and also be aware that there aren't that many upward and onward pathways.\"\n\nThere is no getting around it, Feldstein says: Kelly, once a megastar, is now damaged goods less than two years after quitting Fox News in a huff and moving to NBC News with ambitions for an Oprah Winfrey-style career and brand change.\n\nShe took over the 9 a.m. \"Today\" show slot with her own talk show and a gob-smacking multimillion-dollar salary, but she failed to fit in with an NBC staff suspicious of her signature icy conservatism, which was so successful at Fox. After criticizing her NBC bosses for their handling of the Matt Lauer sexual misconduct debacle, after conflicts with some high-profile guests and after her ratings began plunging, it all came to tears last week.\n\nIn remarks that were clueless at best, racist at worst, Kelly suggested (to an all-white panel of guests) that being offended by blackface in a Halloween costume is merely political correctness run amok. It seemed especially egregious given her history of questionable comments (such as her insistence that Santa Claus and Jesus are white) when she was at Fox.\n\nMegyn Kelly with Melissa Rivers, Jacob Soboroff and Jenna Bush Hager during a Halloween segment on \"Megyn Kelly Today,\" on Oct. 23, 2018, when Kelly defended the use of blackface in Halloween costumes. (Photo: Nathan Congleton/NBC/via AP)\n\nInstantly, the Twitterverse \u2013 and NBC \u2013 told her she was wrong. At the very least, it was a remark that revealed ignorance, Muller says. \"You can\u2019t be a head of show like that for that kind of money and be stupid. (NBC) didn\u2019t buy stupid. The minute she said that, they had no choice.\"\n\nThe next day, Kelly admitted she was wrong in a tearful on-air apology followed by a multiracial panel discussion in which she was schooled on why she was wrong.\n\n\"Maybe she lives in such a bubble she didn\u2019t understand how radioactive her comments would be,\" Feldstein says. \"All those years of red meat at Fox made her think that smaller portions somehow would be acceptable at NBC, and they\u2019re not.\"\n\nAlready alarmed at Kelly's ratings and their fallout, NBC bosses canceled her show, and she and her lawyer, Bryan Freedman, began negotiating the terms of her slow-motion departure. Would she get all of the many millions left in her reported $69 million contract? Would she have to agree to not to speak ill of NBC in the future? Will there be a non-compete clause? It's all still up in the air, but Freedman and NBC are publicly sniping at each other, and furious leaking continues.\n\n2 of 2: The DailyMail 1st published photos of my husb IN OUR HOME & then *did* photog my kids, trailed us to my daughter\u2019s school, & secretly videotaped my 7-yr-old child (her classmates too) & posted it. THIS IS NOT RIGHT. \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) October 31, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly herself is begging for privacy, describing on Twitter how paparazzi are staking out her home. She accused the British tabloid \"The Daily Mail\" of crossing a line by photographing her husband inside their home and recording her 7-year-old daughter at her school. \"THIS IS NOT RIGHT,\" she tweeted Wednesday.\n\nMore: Megyn Kelly begs for privacy after blackface scandal: 'This is not right'\n\nMore: 'Today' moves on without Megyn Kelly as kids at her alma mater say blackface was never OK\n\nMore: Megyn Kelly will not return to NBC's 'Today' show\n\nThe one piece of good news for Kelly: A Hollywood Reporter/Morning Consult survey published Tuesday found that nearly half of the 2,201 adults polled believed that NBC's decision to cancel \"Megyn Kelly Today\" was \"too harsh of a consequence.\"\n\nBut it's done, so now what? The obvious option: Return to Fox News, where her personality, style and views were once wildly popular at the leading cable news network. But Fox nixed that option.\n\nOn Thursday, Fox co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch made it official and on the record at the annual New York Times DealBook conference. \"Look, I\u2019m a big fan of Megyn\u2019s. I like her a lot. We didn\u2019t want her to leave Fox when she did,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving said that, I\u2019m very happy with our current lineup on Fox, and we won\u2019t be making any changes there.\u201d\n\nIt probably didn't help that Kelly left Fox after annoying its base by challenging President Donald Trump's attitudes toward women and after she accused Fox honchos of sexual harassment in a tell-all memoir.\n\n\"She's down to only a handful of options because she burned her bridges at Fox and the related segment of the right-wing media, and she burned her bridges at NBC and all of the mainstream media,\" Feldstein says.\n\nShe would have to mend fences with Fox if she wants to return there or to Fox Nation. Margaret Sullivan, media columnist for The Washington Post, told CNN's Brian Stelter on \"Reliable Sources\" that Kelly might have to swing right again.\n\n\"What's her next chapter? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s done, but it's hard to see quite how she resuscitates herself at this point,\" Sullivan said. \"She may have to swing back right before she can come back on the air in any meaningful way.\"\n\n\"Maybe Fox won't take her now because people there felt personally betrayed by her defection,\" Feldstein says. She may have settle for a temporary lower-key job elsewhere long enough for Fox to embrace her later, he adds.\n\nModerator Megyn Kelly waits for the start of the Republican presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, in January 2016. (Photo: Chris Carlson/AP)\n\nBut no other mainstream network or media operation (say, Netflix) will want to take a chance on her if it will be seen as tolerating the kind of remarks that got her fired from NBC, Thompson says. \"None of them are going to want to send a message that 'our standards are lower,'\" he says.\n\nA syndicated show might work, with her Oprah ambitions, but building a network of affiliates is easier said than done, Thompson says: \"Many are called to be Oprah, few are chosen.\"\n\nAnd it would still be seen as a step down for her \u2013 unless it was spectacularly successful the way, say, Jerry Springer was successful.\n\n\"Something designed for her would be what she was doing at Fox, so maybe she could take what she learned from the NBC experience and try to adjust that and come up with a 'new' Megyn Kelly show that is more like Megyn Kelly,\" Thompson says.\n\n\"It could be the next pathway to Oprah-dom. ... But given what she struggled with at NBC, what makes anyone think she wouldn\u2019t struggle with it again?\"\n\nMegyn Kelly interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin for her short-lived NBC Sunday night show, in June 2017 in St. Petersburg, Russia. ORG XMIT: XAZ134 (Photo: Alexei Druzhinin,/Sputnik/Kremlin Pool/via AP)\n\nAnother consideration for potential Kelly employers is that, aside from her blackface remarks, \"Megyn Kelly Today\" just wasn't that successful as a morning show as demonstrated by the ratings.\n\nThe most successful morning hosts are warm and fuzzy; Kelly is cool and sharp. If she thought she could rebrand herself, she was wrong \u2013 and so was Andrew Lack, the NBC News president who hired her. It's a lesson for her and for other potential employers.\n\n\"You can't take someone from Fox who is attractive and had following there and drop her into something else that doesn\u2019t suit her,\" Muller says. \"And if she makes a stupid mistake, they all wonder what went wrong?\"\n\nThe reason for Kelly's falling ratings was obvious, Thompson says: \"That show was sometimes painful to watch,\" he says. \"She wanted to do an Oprah-style show, and she did it really, really badly.\n\n\"As good as she was at the (prime-time) format she had at Fox, if I were an NBC executive watching, I would put a big part of the (calculus for firing her) at the ratings not being good and the show not being good.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/05/whats-next-megyn-kelly-she-might-have-limited-options/1831838002/", "bad url", "bad url", "", "Todd Gurley deserves his due as he continues to have what might end up being one of the greatest statistical seasons for a running back in NFL history.\n\nBut we need to step back for a moment and focus on his teammate, Johnny Hekker.\n\nHekker, in case you\u2019re not aware, makes his living as a punter for the Los Angeles Rams.

Napoli will face Paris Saint Germain in a Champions League, Group C soccer match Tuesday. (Cesare Abbate/ANSA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nROME (AP) \u2014 When Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti looks at Paris Saint-Germain, he sees a squad transformed from when he became the first big-name hire by the club's Qatari owners.\n\n\"There are many differences. Back then the squad was still being constructed. Whereas now the project has reached the final phase \u2014 winning the Champions League. PSG is now among the best squads in Europe,\" Ancelotti said Monday, a day before Napoli hosts PSG.\n\nAncelotti led PSG to the French league title in 2013, the first of five championships in six years. With a squad featuring two of the world's top players in Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, the only cup missing for the big-spending Qatari owners remains the Champions League.\n\nHaving also coached Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich in recent seasons, Ancelotti raised some eyebrows when he returned to Italy for this season with Napoli, a club that hasn't won Serie A since Diego Maradona led the team to its only two titles in 1987 and 1990.\n\nWhile challenging eventual champion Juventus in Serie A last season, Napoli looked like a poor shadow of itself in Europe.\n\nLast season, Napoli finished third in its group behind Manchester City and Shakhtar Donetsk and was relegated to the Europa League.\n\nPrevious Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri openly discussed his preference for Serie A over the Europa League and the Partenopei were promptly eliminated from the second-tier competition by Leipzig.\n\nAncelotti has restored Napoli's pride in Europe, as evidenced by a 1-0 win over Liverpool and a 2-2 draw at PSG two weeks ago in a match that Napoli dominated.\n\n\"Facing the big clubs is never easy,\" Ancelotti said. \"It was a bit easier in the first leg because we played well, and now we want to repeat that performance at the San Paolo stadium.\"\n\nLiverpool leads Group C with six points, followed by Napoli with five, PSG with four and Red Star Belgrade with one.\n\n\"During the draw we were considered the third force,\" Ancelotti said. \"Now we're in position to qualify.\"\n\nIn a match featuring an unusually high number of connections between former players and teammates, PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will mark his Champions League return after a three-match ban in his native Italy against Ancelotti, who coached him at the beginning of his career at Parma.\n\n\"It's always a pleasure to see him and to see that he's motivated despite his age,\" Ancelotti said of the 40-year-old Buffon. \"I have great respect for him as a professional and great affection for him as a friend.\"\n\nPSG striker Edinson Cavani scored 104 goals for Napoli in all competitions between 2010 and 2013 \u2014 good for fourth on the club's all-time list \u2014 and is now PSG's all-time leading scorer with 176 goals.\n\nWhat's more is that Cavani's two sons still live in Napoli with his former wife \u2014 and the boys support Napoli.\n\nCavani has been nursing a slight muscle injury but is expected to play, amid reports that he is considering a return to Napoli for next season.\n\nAngel Di Maria, who scored PSG's late equalizer in the first meeting with Napoli, won the Champions League under Ancelotti at Real Madrid in 2014.\n\nPSG midfielder Marco Verratti was a teammate of Napoli striker Lorenzo Insigne when they won Serie B with Pescara in 2012 \u2014 a season in which Insigne scored 18 goals and created 14 assists.\n\nPromoted to more of a pure striker role under Ancelotti in a 4-4-2 formation, Insigne has thrived with nine goals in 13 matches in all competitions this season.\n\nSo has fellow striker Dries Mertens, who scored a hat trick in a 5-1 win over Empoli in Serie A on Friday.\n\nAncelotti had been using Mertens in a bench role.\n\n\"The truth is that it's difficult to leave out a duo like Insigne-Mertens,\" Ancelotti said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That\u2019s led to a sudden surge in some markets where nonstop flights to Iceland proliferated practically overnight.\n\nIn Cleveland, for example, the midsized U.S. market went from having no nonstop flights to Europe to suddenly having two to the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik after WOW and Icelandair announced flights only about 24 hours apart. And in Dallas/Fort Worth, the airport went from having no nonstops to Iceland to having three after WOW, Icelandair and hometown carrier American all announced new Reykjavik flights in just a two-month span.\n\nIcelandair is more of a traditional full-service carrier, offering business-class seats and amenities more in line with traditional airlines. WOW, on the other hand, is part of a new breed of \u201cultra low-cost carriers\u201d that charge extra for everything beyond boarding the plane.\n\nGiven their different niches in the market, Icelandair says the companies will continue to operate as standalone brands.\n\nAVIATION PHOTOS: 32 cool Boeing 757 pics (story continues below)\n\n\u201cWOW air has in recent years built a strong brand and enjoyed great success in the company\u2018s markets to and from Iceland and across the Atlantic,\u201d interim Icelandair CEO Bogi Nils Bogason says in a statement. \u201cThere are many opportunities for synergies with the two companies, but they will continue to operate under their own brands and operating approvals.\u201d\n\nBogason's statement also touched on the importance tourism plays in Iceland's economy.\n\n\u201cThe tourism industry is one of the cornerstones of the Icelandic economy and it is important that flights to and from Iceland will remain frequent,\u201d he added.\n\nAt WOW, CEO and founder Sk\u00fali Mogensen developed a reputation as something of a maverick as he tried to find success by rapidly expanding his budget model to long-haul flights between North America and Europe.

It is used to treat pain in cancer patients but the street version is often mixed with heroin and cocaine, and ingested by the user unknowingly.\n\nAlcohol also slows the breathing rate, while cocaine, a stimulant, can cause a lethal heart rhythm. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says the combination of an opioid with cocaine creates an intense rush that is said to combine the highs of both drugs while suppressing the negative qualities of both drugs.\n\nHowever, that pairing, known as a speedball, can prove a fatal combination, as in the case of comedian John Belushi, whose 1982 death resulted from taking them intravenously. Miller's autopsy report noted the absence of needle marks but did mention the presence of a powder-crusted $20 bill, which suggested he snorted the drugs rather than injecting them.\n\nAccording to the report, Miller was found unresponsive, kneeling on his bed in a \"praying position\" at his Los Angeles-area home on Sept. 27 by his assistant, who called 911 and was instructed to perform CPR until paramedics arrived. They pronounced him dead of an apparent overdose at the scene at 11:51 a.m. PDT.\n\nThe report also noted that Miller, whose real name was Malcolm James McCormick, had a history of abusing prescription and street drugs as well as alcohol, relapsing as recently as three days before his death.\n\nThe Pittsburgh native's death came just a few months after his breakup with longtime girlfriend Ariana Grande and just weeks after the release of his well-received album \"Swimming.\"\n\nHe was remembered at a public vigil in Pittsburgh in September and a tribute show in Los Angeles last week.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/05/mac-miller-overdosed-fentanyl-cocaine-alcohol-coroner/1891524002/", "CLOSE A look at Tuesday's midterms from the late night comics.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 Paris Saint-Germain has challenged UEFA in court after a club finance panel reopened its investigation into the French champion, and can assess transfer deals for superstar forwards Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Monday the appeal case is confidential at the request of PSG and UEFA and gave no further details.\n\nQatar-owned PSG has long been a target of UEFA rules designed to curb so-called financial doping by wealthy backers of clubs which qualify for the Champions League or Europa League.\n\nThe Financial Fair Play program requires clubs to approach break-even on soccer-related business, such as player trading and wages, and also assesses the fair market value of sponsorship deals.\n\nPSG forfeited 20 million euros ($22.8 million) of Champions League prize money in a 2014 settlement. Then, Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City got the same deal from UEFA in signature cases from the first round of FFP sanctions.\n\nDetails of tough 2014 negotiations between both clubs and UEFA's then-leaders were revealed at the weekend by European media. Published emails included legal threats by the clubs trying to prevent possible bans from the Champions League worth tens of millions of euros per season.\n\nIn April 2017, UEFA released PSG and Man City from their settlement deals for complying with three years of stricter monitoring.\n\nPSG then spent heavily in that offseason, breaking soccer's transfer record to buy Neymar from Barcelona for 222 million euros ($253 million). A loan deal was agreed with Monaco for Mbappe that became a 180 million euros ($205 million) purchase this year.\n\nUEFA opened an investigation soon after the Mbappe loan, and warned PSG in June this year to raise cash quickly from player sales to balance its 2017-18 accounts. UEFA also said some sponsor deals, including from Qatar, were overvalued.\n\nStill, investigators for UEFA's Club Financial Control Body closed their scrutiny of PSG's accounts for the year through June 2017 \u2014 before the Neymar signing.\n\nThe UEFA panel's judging chamber reviewed the decision and in September sent the case back for a \"deeper investigation.\" It is that move which PSG is challenging at CAS.\n\nThe sports court's judges must first decide if it is admissible to appeal a procedural step rather than a final ruling.\n\nJoining PSG in a similar situation, Galatasaray was also placed under further investigation by the UEFA panel last month. It is unclear if the Turkish club has appealed to CAS.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Account balances at the end of September were nearly double the average balance of $56,900 401(k) back in the third quarter of 2008 during the financial crisis, Fidelity said.\n\nThe average IRA balance also notched a record, climbing to $111,000, more than double the $52,000 balance from the third quarter of 2008.\n\nStocks, however, have turned volatile in the final quarter of 2018. In October, the benchmark U.S. stock index, the Standard & Poor's 500, briefly fell into correction territory, defined as a 10-percent drop from a prior high. Heading into Monday's trading session, the S&P 500 was down 7.1 percent from its record.\n\nOne of the positives of the financial crisis was that it motivated investors to educate themselves about the steps they should take to \"protect and grow\" their retirement savings, said Kevin Barry, president of workplace investing at Fidelity.\n\n\"We've seen an increasing amount of positive savings behavior over the last 10 years, which helped put many people back on track for their retirement savings goals,\" he said.\n\nSavers have also benefited from new 401(k) plan benefits, such as automatic enrollment as well as employers placing workers that don't select specific types of investments into so-called default options like target-date funds. These funds have skyrocketed in popularity. They have a more aggressive mix of assets \u2014 including a bigger helping of stocks \u2014 when people are younger but they become more conservative as workers near retirement.\n\nMore Money: Trade wars, taxes, immigration among top economic issues for voters in midterm elections\n\nMore Money: Amazon drops $25 minimum for free shipping through holiday shopping season\n\nMore Money: Wall Street bids goodbye to \"Red October\" and confronts more uncertain future for stocks\n\nOther highlights from Fidelity's latest retirement savings analysis:\n\nRecord number of 401(k), IRA millionaires\n\nThe number of Fidelity 401(k) holders with balances of more than $1 million increased to 187,400 at the end of the third quarter, up 41 percent from a year earlier and topping last quarter's prior record of 168,000. The number of IRA millionaires rose to a record 170,400, 25 percent more than a year earlier.\n\nMore Money: 401(k) millionaires at Fidelity jump 41 percent in third quarter to record 187,400\n\nContribution levels from women notch record\n\nFemale investors contributed a record 8.5 percent of their pay, on average, to their 401(k)s in the quarter ended in September. What's more, 32 percent of women with 401(k)s increased the amount of money they set aside in their accounts over the past year, up from 14 percent in the 12-month period ended in the the third quarter of 2008.\n\nTarget-date funds gain bigger following\n\nThe popularity of target-date funds, or funds that take more risks when savers are younger and fewer when workers near retirement, continued to grow. For the first time, more than half (50.4 percent) of 401(k) savers had all of their retirement savings in target-date funds.\n\nJust over 30 percent of all 401(k) assets were invested in target-date funds at the end of the third quarter, up from 9.8 percent 10 years earlier. And a little more than half (51 percent) of all new investments in 401(k)s was deposited into these funds.\n\nBalances of consistent millennial savers on rise\n\nThe average balance for members of the millennial generation who have been invested in their 401(k) plans for five straight years topped $80,000, up from $20,600 five years earlier.\n\nNest eggs of long-term 401(k) savers swell\n\nThe average balance for Fidelity 401(k) investors who have stayed invested in their 401(k) accounts for five consecutive years reached $221,200 at the end of the third quarter, up from an average of $103,700 five years ago.\n\nAnd the average account balance for investors that have been saving continuously in their 401(k) plans for 10 years reached $305,400. That balance was nearly five times the $65,700 amount for this group 10 years ago.\n\nWorkers who have been saving in their 401(k) since the third quarter of 2003, or for fifteen straight years, have seen their average balance increase to $400,300, up from $47,800 back in 2003.\n\n\"These groups of long-term savers are great examples of how a consistent approach to retirement savings can lead to significant financial gains over the long run,\" Fidelity's Barry said.\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/05/401-k-account-balance-hits-record/1890029002/", "Former New Orleans Saints wideout Joe Horn did see Michael Thomas recreate his touchdown celebration from 2003, in which he hid a cell phone in the padding of a Superdome goal post and made a \u201ccall\u201d after scoring.\n\nIn a pair of interviews, he talked about the emotional reaction that he had while watching from a gym in Mississippi the score and celebration in the Saints\u2019 win over the Los Angeles Rams (which included an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, just like Horn did back when he did it).\n\nHere\u2019s what he had to say on Sunday hours after the celebration, via NOLA.com:\n\n\u201cWhen I saw him bring out that cellphone, I teared up,\u201d Horn said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that some kids don\u2019t do, to pay homage to an old soul.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNovak Djokovic returned to No. 1 on Monday after a two-year absence and is assured of becoming the first man in the history of the ATP rankings to finish a season at the top spot after being outside the top 20 during that season.\n\nThat's because the man he overtook, Rafael Nadal, is done for 2018. Nadal withdrew from the ATP Finals on Monday, citing an abdominal injury, and announced he was having arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle.\n\nDjokovic will be the ATP's year-ending No. 1 for the fifth time, pulling even with Roger Federer and Jimmy Connors for the second most since the computer rankings began in 1973. Pete Sampras holds the record of six.\n\n\"Reflecting on what I've been through in the last year, it's quite a phenomenal achievement,\" said Djokovic, who was No. 2 last week and hadn't been No. 1 since November 2016. \"And, of course, I'm very, very happy and proud about it. Five months ago, if you told me that ... it was highly improbable at that time, considering my ranking and the way I played and felt on the court.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old from Serbia fell to No. 22 in May after beginning the year with a 6-6 record while recovering from surgery on his right elbow. He hadn't been ranked that low since he was 22nd in 2006 as a teenager.\n\nBut Djokovic has gone 43-5 since, including Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open after reuniting with Marian Vajda, the longtime coach with whom he had split.\n\nDjokovic raised his haul of major trophies to 14, tied with Sampras for third most in men's tennis history behind Federer with 20 and Nadal with 17.\n\nThe last man to go from outside the top 20 to No. 1 within a single season was Marat Safin, who was No. 38 and No. 1 in 2000, before ending that year at No. 2.\n\n\"What Novak has achieved this season has to go down as one of the great sporting comebacks,\" ATP Executive Chairman Chris Kerned said. \"It's been a phenomenal return to form that would have been hard to imagine just six months ago.\"\n\nNadal said on Twitter on Monday that he was still bothered by the stomach muscle issue that forced him to withdraw from last week's Paris Masters.

Here\u2019s what we learned in Week 8\u2026\n\n1. Browns GM John Dorsey wasted a lot of money last offseason\n\nWhile the early returns on Dorsey\u2019s first draft in Cleveland have been positive, the general manager\u2019s class of veteran acquisitions isn\u2019t doing so hot. The Browns splashed a lot of cash during the offseason in order to field a competitive team, and they don\u2019t have much to show for it after the team fell to 2-6-1 on Sunday following a loss to Dorsey\u2019s former employer. And we\u2019re starting to see why the Chiefs may have parted ways with him.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at all the veterans Dorsey brought in\u2026\n\nBrowns veteran additions this offseason:\n\n* QB Tyrod Taylor\n\n* WR Jarvis Landry\n\n* RB Carlos Hyde\n\n* LB Mychal Kendricks\n\n* CB T.J. Carrie\n\n* DB Damarious Randall\n\n* CB EJ Gaines\n\n* TE Darren Fells\n\n* OT Chris Hubbard\n\n* DE Chris Smith\n\n* DB Terrance Mitchell\n\n* WR Jeff Janis \u2014 Field Yates (@FieldYates) June 4, 2018\n\nTo recap:\n\nTaylor was benched after three starts.\n\nHyde was traded last month. Landry has produced only 528 yards on 94 targets.\n\nKendricks was released after being charged with insider trading.\n\nCarrie has been mediocre.\n\nGaines hasn\u2019t seen much of the field and hasn\u2019t been all that productive when he has.\n\nHubbard isn\u2019t helping a line that has struggled to protect Baker Mayfield.\n\nMitchell was placed on IR after a rough first month.\n\nSmith still hasn\u2019t registered a sack.\n\nAnd Janis was released before the season.\n\nThe trade for Damarious Randall was the only move for a veteran that can be considered a success. In all, the Browns are paying around $56.6 million for all of their veteran acquisitions, and what do they have to show for it? Not a whole lot. Cleveland got Randall, two backup quarterbacks (including Drew Stanton, who is making $2.5 million this year to model team apparel on the sideline), a solid slot receiver, an average tackle and a handful of mediocre defensive backs.\n\nThis was Dorsey\u2019s M.O. in Kansas City: He was great at finding studs in the draft but did not know how to manage the cap. Not much has changed in Cleveland.\n\n2. The Steelers are going to run away with the AFC North\n\nA few weeks ago, the Steelers were falling behind the Bengals and Ravens in the AFC North standings and the defense looked like an unmitigated disaster. Things change quickly in the NFL, though. Pittsburgh defense is playing good football \u2014 it now ranks 15th in points allowed after a disastrous start \u2014 and the team looks primed to run away with the division after a convincing victory in Baltimore on Sunday.\n\nThe Steelers\u2019 lead in the division isn\u2019t insurmountable by any means. They lead the Bengals by a half-game and the Ravens by two-and-a-half. But both Cincinnati and Baltimore are trending down \u2014 they\u2019re a combined 1-5 over their last six \u2014 and their schedules don\u2019t get any easier over the second half of the season. The Bengals play the Saints at home next week and still have trips to Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Los Angeles left on their slate. The Ravens have road games against the Chiefs, Falcons and Chargers scheduled after a Week 11 matchup with Cincy.\n\nPittsburgh has a daunting schedule ahead, too. They\u2019ll play the Panthers, Patriots, Chargers and Saints over the next two months, but those first three games are at home.\n\n3. Bill Belichick is still in a class of his own\n\nNobody should have been surprised by Cordarrelle Patterson\u2019s breakout game as a running back on Sunday night in a 31-17 win over the Packers. We actually called it back in April.\n\nRelated How the Patriots can finally turn Cordarrelle Patterson into a fantasy football star\n\nThis is what Belichick does. Give him a player with some skills, and he\u2019ll find a way to turn him into a useful player. Everybody laughs when Belichick praises a seemingly mediocre player during press conferences, but his ability to see the best in a player is one of the many reasons that he is, far and away, the best coach in the NFL. Belichick is so good at recognizing a player\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and carving out a role for that player based around what he does best.\n\nTake Patterson for example. He is a bad route-runner but can do serious damage with the ball in his hands. So Belichick and his staff have put him in positions where he can get the ball in his hands without having to get himself open. The easiest way to do that? Just hand him the ball on a running play. Against the Packers, Patterson needed only 11 carries to rack up 61 yards and a touchdown. As crazy as it sounds, the receiver is probably the team\u2019s best short-yardage option going forward. Who would\u2019ve thought? Belichick. That\u2019s who.\n\nThe Patriots roster is never overly impressive. There are a handful of stars and then a bunch of guys who do one thing really well. Belichick just doesn\u2019t ask those other guys to stray too far out of their comfort zone. Patterson is no different.\n\n4. The Marcus Peters trade is officially a disaster\n\nThe Rams spent the offseason collecting star players like they were Infinity Stones. While the strategy has mostly worked, it seems to have backfired in at least one instance: Marcus Peters has been awful.\n\nLooking back, this shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise. The former Chiefs star isn\u2019t the best fit for what Wade Phillips wants to do on defense, which, so far in 2018, has been playing press man coverage. In Kansas City, Peters was at his best in off-coverage, where he was able to keep his eyes on the quarterback. That\u2019s when he made the bulk of his splash plays.\n\nHis coverage skills have been exposed in Los Angeles. He was roughed up by Michael Thomas in the Rams\u2019 45-35 loss to the Saints. Thomas went for 211 yards and a score with Peters shadowing him for much of the game.\n\n#Saints WR Michael Thomas vs. Rams 12 Rec | 211 YD | 1 TD Had CB Marcus Peters looking like DeVante Harris reincarnated pic.twitter.com/2GUpQnTtN4 \u2014 Brandon Varnam (@BravoVictor03) November 5, 2018\n\nIt was another bad performance in a season full of them. Coming into Week 9, quarterbacks targeting Peters had compiled a passer rating of 138.7, per Pro Football Focus. That number will only go up after Drew Brees and Thomas picked on him all afternoon.\n\n5. The NFC playoff field is nearly all set, and the 3-4-1 Packers are still very much alive\n\nSo we have the Rams running away with the NFC West; the Panthers and Saints will represent the NFC South in the playoffs with the runner-up taking the first wild-card spot; the North is the Vikings\u2019 to lose (sorry Chicago); and the NFC East will come down to two late-season matchups between the Eagles and Redskins. That leaves one wild card spot for the East and North runners-up plus the Falcons, Seahawks and Packers to battle it out for.\n\nNFC Playoff picture as of right now with Dallas playing tonight pic.twitter.com/KoyOsszYJD \u2014 vaughn mcclure (@vxmcclure23) November 5, 2018\n\nHere\u2019s how I see that race playing out: The Vikings will take control of their division over these next two months as the Bears fall victim to a tough schedule that includes two against Minnesota and games against the Rams and Vikings. The Seahawks will also fall out of the race after a brutal stretch that includes away games against the Rams and Panthers and home tilts with the Packers, Chiefs and Vikings.\n\nThat leaves Green Bay, Atlanta and the loser of the Eagles-Redskins matchups to battle it out for the last playoff spot. The Falcons still have two matchups with Carolina and New Orleans left on the schedule, as well as a trip to Lambeau. That could be an elimination for both teams. Washington has the easiest schedule of these teams, so Philadelphia may have to sweep the series to have a shot at the division. Even if they do, the defending champs still have to go on the road to play the Rams and Saints. It will be tough for the Eagles just to get to 10-6.\n\nBased on the schedule, the Redskins and Packers should have the inside track to those last two playoff spots that are up for grabs.", "A bronze statue of Liverpool striker Mohammed Salah is on display in a conference hall at an international youths gathering, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

(AP Photo/Paul White) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 After only two games, Santiago Solari is making Real Madrid fans forget about the search for a new coach.\n\nAnd Madrid may very well give it up if he keeps succeeding.\n\nSolari has done well since taking over from Julen Lopetegui, pleasing players and fans, and increasing his chances of taking over the squad permanently.\n\nDiscussions about Antonio Conte and Roberto Martinez have faded since Solari took control and quickly put Madrid back on track. In his short time in charge, Solari boosted the squad's confidence and got the victories that had eluded the team.\n\nThe former Madrid player arrived with the club in crisis and enduring a run that included five losses in seven matches in all competitions, including a demoralizing 5-1 loss to Barcelona at Camp Nou.\n\nThe 2-0 win over Valladolid on Saturday halted the team's five-match winless streak in the Spanish league. Madrid had entered the match at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium having lost four of its last five games in the competition, including three straight.\n\n\"Real Madrid needed the victory. It's not easy to win when you are going through a difficult moment,\" Solari said. \"Football is all about state of mind, emotions, self-confidence.\"\n\nIn the Argentine's first game in charge, Madrid routed third-division club Melilla 4-0 in the Copa del Rey, scoring the same number of goals that Lopetegui's team had netted in the seven previous matches.\n\nTRUSTING VINICIUS JUNIOR\n\nOne of the right moves made by Solari was to give more playing time to Vinicius Junior, the young Brazilian forward who arrived amid high expectations but had been relegated to the \"B'' team under Lopetegui.\n\nVinicius Junior was the man of the match against Melilla and helped open up the game when Madrid struggled against Valladolid. He came off the bench in the 73rd minute and 10 minutes later scored the team's opening goal.\n\n\"We'll keep going step by step to try to get back to where we deserve to be,\" Vinicius Junior said.\n\nThe decision to give more chances to Vinicius Junior was highly popular, helping Solari earn credit with the tough Madrid crowd and further increase his chances of staying on the job.\n\nSOLID DEFENSE\n\nSolari also didn't hesitate to use young fullbacks Alvaro Odriozola and Sergio Reguilon in defense while the regular starters were injured. Lopetegui thought differently and often improvised players at the back when needed.\n\nThe defense improved under the Argentine coach, with two consecutive clean sheets. Madrid had conceded 10 goals in its last seven matches under Lopetegui.\n\nAWAY CHALLENGES\n\nSolari will be fully tested in a stretch in which Madrid will play four consecutive games away from the Bernabeu, starting on Wednesday at Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League.\n\nThe team then plays at Celta Vigo and at Eibar in the Spanish league, and finishes the month with a Champions League match against Roma in Italy.\n\nIf Solari survives and is still in charge by then, it will mean Madrid's search for a new coach will likely be over.\n\nFLIRTING WITH RELEGATION\n\nWhat started as a promising season has turned into an endless struggle for Villarreal and Valencia.\n\nThe two clubs finished fourth and fifth in the league a year ago, and both had high hopes entering this season.\n\nNeither team can get things going, though, with Valencia in 15th place and Villarreal in 16th.\n\nValencia, with only one win in 11 league matches, is two points from the relegation zone. Villarreal, with two wins, is one point away.\n\nThey are just in front of Athletic Bilbao, another struggling team which usually contends for the positions near the top of the table.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Pure Michigan)\n\nIn addition to its moniker as the Great Lakes State, Michigan is also a state of many peaks. As soon as peak summer solstice hits, many Michiganders are already counting down the days until peak winter wonderland. The reason being, they know the litany of adventurous activities that await them when the seasons change.\n\nMichigan is a magical place after a few inches of heavy snowfall. But outside its major cities, where nature is beautifully allowed to take its course, it really shines. From wine tours, snowshoe trails, skiing and sled dog races to breakfast in bed or by the fire, a winterized Michigan is a sight worth seeing. Here\u2019s what to do when you get there.\n\n1. Wine-ter in Traverse City\n\nMichigan boasts plenty of wineries that operate all winter long. (Photo: Pure Michigan)\n\nThe perfect pairing to the Michigan-made wines produced on Traverse City\u2019s numerous vineyards are the bespoke brands of cheeses produced on its nearby farms. During winter, local wine tours receive a festive makeover. Visitors can sip cool climate wines while walking through snow covered groves \u2014 or, take your wine inside to one of the city\u2019s many bed and breakfast manors. For a romantic getaway choose a (kids-free) inn like A Breath of Heaven Bed and Breakfast or go family-friendly at the popular Inn at Chateau Grand Traverse.\n\n2. Get away from it all in Gaylord\n\nSnowmobiling in Gaylord, MI is a popular winter activity. (Photo: Pure Michigan)\n\nGaylord natives take full advantage of the areas wide open spaces, as evidenced by the town\u2019s annual Snowmobile fun run. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with snowmobiles, don\u2019t worry, the race is equally as fun to watch from the sidelines. More comfortable on two wheels? Take advantage of Gaylord\u2019s fat tire biking trails. The picturesque 5k trail at Treetops Resort is open year-round, which means you can get your thrills no matter the season.\n\n3. A winter worth two thumbs UP\n\nEach year, 200 sled dogs race to the finish line in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. (Photo: Pure Michigan)\n\nNature has the upper hand in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, and its residents prefer it that way. In January and February, the Michigan Audubon club will host a tour of the Peninsula\u2019s birds, which includes, snowy owls, gyrfalcons, hoary redpolls and much more. In place of watching birds up above, you\u2019ll find most Yoopers gearing up for the UP 200 sled dog race in February. The race attracts spectators from around the world and has a culminating celebration in downtown Marquette, Michigan. Another hot ticket in the cold season is the I-500 snowmobile race in St. Sault Marie. The Upper Peninsula\u2019s \u201cNASCAR on ice\u201d will leave your heart racing from the sidelines.\n\n4. A walk to remember in St. Ignace\n\nPeruse through perfect powder trails in St. Ignace, Michigan. (Photo: Pure Michigan)\n\nThe snowshoe trails of St. Ignace offer you a chance to see the outdoor wilderness as natives did: slow and steady. The shoes are essential to navigate the areas deep snow banks, and you\u2019d be surprised how quickly you can catch on to the rhythm of moving in the shoes. Stop in at Timmy Lee\u2019s Pub off US-2 in St. Ignace for some comfort food, and you\u2019ll be warmed and ready to take on another trek.\n\n5. Summer redux at Boyne Falls\n\nIce fishing on Deer Lake is a popular winter pastime in Michigan. (Photo: Pure Michigan)\n\nDon\u2019t feel like you had the proper chance to really enjoy the lake this summer? Take your water recreation inside at the Avalanche Bay Indoor Waterpark in Boyne Falls, located in the heart of Boyne Mountain Resort. The park\u2019s numerous waterslides and pools are ideal for a family-friendly getaway, featuring indoor golf and a spa for adults. Avalanche is touted as the largest indoor water resort in Michigan at 88,000 square feet, but you\u2019ll find it\u2019s the resort\u2019s prime location that really hits the ball out of the park. Ice fishing at the nearby Deer Lake is available if you want to relive trying to hook a summer catch. Or you can sit and sip hot cocoa from the shore and watch the local ice fishing professionals show you how ice fishing is done.\n\n6. Celebrate the season at Mackinac Island\n\nMackinac Island is especially magical in winter. (Photo: Pure Michigan)\n\nAlthough Mackinac Island may seem quiet and serene when you arrive during the island\u2019s off season, it\u2019s very much alive inside the many toasty taverns and hospitable hotels in the winter.\n\nArrive a little before December, and you can catch the Christmas Bazaar, happening Dec. 1-3, 2018. Or wait until the holiday hustle and bustle is over and celebrate the season at the Mackinac Island Winter Festival in February. You\u2019ll feel like you have the island to yourself with a few hundred of your new closest friends. The most reliable way to get there is via ferry \u2013 but once the water completely freezes, there are flights to the island from the nearby city of Pellston, Michigan. Check with one of the local flight services such as Great Lakes Air or Air Services Inc. for a schedule of flights to and from the island. Or, if you\u2019d rather get your lake legs, check with the local coast guard to see when it is safe to travel across the frozen lake safely.\n\nMichigan winters offer something for every type of traveler. Whether you\u2019re looking for a leisurely getaway, natural wonder or outdoor adventure, there\u2019s lots to do, see and explore in the Great Lakes State.

Here\u2019s what we learned in Week 8\u2026\n\n1. Browns GM John Dorsey wasted a lot of money last offseason\n\nWhile the early returns on Dorsey\u2019s first draft in Cleveland have been positive, the general manager\u2019s class of veteran acquisitions isn\u2019t doing so hot. The Browns splashed a lot of cash during the offseason in order to field a competitive team, and they don\u2019t have much to show for it after the team fell to 2-6-1 on Sunday following a loss to Dorsey\u2019s former employer. And we\u2019re starting to see why the Chiefs may have parted ways with him.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at all the veterans Dorsey brought in\u2026\n\nBrowns veteran additions this offseason:\n\n* QB Tyrod Taylor\n\n* WR Jarvis Landry\n\n* RB Carlos Hyde\n\n* LB Mychal Kendricks\n\n* CB T.J. Carrie\n\n* DB Damarious Randall\n\n* CB EJ Gaines\n\n* TE Darren Fells\n\n* OT Chris Hubbard\n\n* DE Chris Smith\n\n* DB Terrance Mitchell\n\n* WR Jeff Janis \u2014 Field Yates (@FieldYates) June 4, 2018\n\nTo recap:\n\nTaylor was benched after three starts.\n\nHyde was traded last month. Landry has produced only 528 yards on 94 targets.\n\nKendricks was released after being charged with insider trading.\n\nCarrie has been mediocre.\n\nGaines hasn\u2019t seen much of the field and hasn\u2019t been all that productive when he has.\n\nHubbard isn\u2019t helping a line that has struggled to protect Baker Mayfield.\n\nMitchell was placed on IR after a rough first month.\n\nSmith still hasn\u2019t registered a sack.\n\nAnd Janis was released before the season.\n\nThe trade for Damarious Randall was the only move for a veteran that can be considered a success. In all, the Browns are paying around $56.6 million for all of their veteran acquisitions, and what do they have to show for it? Not a whole lot. Cleveland got Randall, two backup quarterbacks (including Drew Stanton, who is making $2.5 million this year to model team apparel on the sideline), a solid slot receiver, an average tackle and a handful of mediocre defensive backs.\n\nThis was Dorsey\u2019s M.O. in Kansas City: He was great at finding studs in the draft but did not know how to manage the cap. Not much has changed in Cleveland.\n\n2. The Steelers are going to run away with the AFC North\n\nA few weeks ago, the Steelers were falling behind the Bengals and Ravens in the AFC North standings and the defense looked like an unmitigated disaster. Things change quickly in the NFL, though. Pittsburgh defense is playing good football \u2014 it now ranks 15th in points allowed after a disastrous start \u2014 and the team looks primed to run away with the division after a convincing victory in Baltimore on Sunday.\n\nThe Steelers\u2019 lead in the division isn\u2019t insurmountable by any means. They lead the Bengals by a half-game and the Ravens by two-and-a-half. But both Cincinnati and Baltimore are trending down \u2014 they\u2019re a combined 1-5 over their last six \u2014 and their schedules don\u2019t get any easier over the second half of the season. The Bengals play the Saints at home next week and still have trips to Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Los Angeles left on their slate. The Ravens have road games against the Chiefs, Falcons and Chargers scheduled after a Week 11 matchup with Cincy.\n\nPittsburgh has a daunting schedule ahead, too. They\u2019ll play the Panthers, Patriots, Chargers and Saints over the next two months, but those first three games are at home.\n\n3. Bill Belichick is still in a class of his own\n\nNobody should have been surprised by Cordarrelle Patterson\u2019s breakout game as a running back on Sunday night in a 31-17 win over the Packers. We actually called it back in April.\n\nRelated How the Patriots can finally turn Cordarrelle Patterson into a fantasy football star\n\nThis is what Belichick does. Give him a player with some skills, and he\u2019ll find a way to turn him into a useful player. Everybody laughs when Belichick praises a seemingly mediocre player during press conferences, but his ability to see the best in a player is one of the many reasons that he is, far and away, the best coach in the NFL. Belichick is so good at recognizing a player\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and carving out a role for that player based around what he does best.\n\nTake Patterson for example. He is a bad route-runner but can do serious damage with the ball in his hands. So Belichick and his staff have put him in positions where he can get the ball in his hands without having to get himself open. The easiest way to do that? Just hand him the ball on a running play. Against the Packers, Patterson needed only 11 carries to rack up 61 yards and a touchdown. As crazy as it sounds, the receiver is probably the team\u2019s best short-yardage option going forward. Who would\u2019ve thought? Belichick. That\u2019s who.\n\nThe Patriots roster is never overly impressive. There are a handful of stars and then a bunch of guys who do one thing really well. Belichick just doesn\u2019t ask those other guys to stray too far out of their comfort zone. Patterson is no different.\n\n4. The Marcus Peters trade is officially a disaster\n\nThe Rams spent the offseason collecting star players like they were Infinity Stones. While the strategy has mostly worked, it seems to have backfired in at least one instance: Marcus Peters has been awful.\n\nLooking back, this shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise. The former Chiefs star isn\u2019t the best fit for what Wade Phillips wants to do on defense, which, so far in 2018, has been playing press man coverage. In Kansas City, Peters was at his best in off-coverage, where he was able to keep his eyes on the quarterback. That\u2019s when he made the bulk of his splash plays.\n\nHis coverage skills have been exposed in Los Angeles. He was roughed up by Michael Thomas in the Rams\u2019 45-35 loss to the Saints. Thomas went for 211 yards and a score with Peters shadowing him for much of the game.\n\n#Saints WR Michael Thomas vs. Rams 12 Rec | 211 YD | 1 TD Had CB Marcus Peters looking like DeVante Harris reincarnated pic.twitter.com/2GUpQnTtN4 \u2014 Brandon Varnam (@BravoVictor03) November 5, 2018\n\nIt was another bad performance in a season full of them. Coming into Week 9, quarterbacks targeting Peters had compiled a passer rating of 138.7, per Pro Football Focus. That number will only go up after Drew Brees and Thomas picked on him all afternoon.\n\n5. The NFC playoff field is nearly all set, and the 3-4-1 Packers are still very much alive\n\nSo we have the Rams running away with the NFC West; the Panthers and Saints will represent the NFC South in the playoffs with the runner-up taking the first wild-card spot; the North is the Vikings\u2019 to lose (sorry Chicago); and the NFC East will come down to two late-season matchups between the Eagles and Redskins. That leaves one wild card spot for the East and North runners-up plus the Falcons, Seahawks and Packers to battle it out for.\n\nNFC Playoff picture as of right now with Dallas playing tonight pic.twitter.com/KoyOsszYJD \u2014 vaughn mcclure (@vxmcclure23) November 5, 2018\n\nHere\u2019s how I see that race playing out: The Vikings will take control of their division over these next two months as the Bears fall victim to a tough schedule that includes two against Minnesota and games against the Rams and Vikings. The Seahawks will also fall out of the race after a brutal stretch that includes away games against the Rams and Panthers and home tilts with the Packers, Chiefs and Vikings.\n\nThat leaves Green Bay, Atlanta and the loser of the Eagles-Redskins matchups to battle it out for the last playoff spot. The Falcons still have two matchups with Carolina and New Orleans left on the schedule, as well as a trip to Lambeau. That could be an elimination for both teams. Washington has the easiest schedule of these teams, so Philadelphia may have to sweep the series to have a shot at the division. Even if they do, the defending champs still have to go on the road to play the Rams and Saints. It will be tough for the Eagles just to get to 10-6.\n\nBased on the schedule, the Redskins and Packers should have the inside track to those last two playoff spots that are up for grabs.", "bad url", "bad url", "Prince performs his first of three shows onstage during 'One Night...

We'll publish them every Monday morning.\n\nDA races hinge on changing incarceration in Oklahoma\n\nThe state with the nation's highest incarceration rate may be on its way to reform \u2014 and it could be voters who push it there this week. On Tuesday, nearly a third of the state's 27 district attorney seats are being challenged. And Oklahoma's powerful DAs (many of whom run on tough-on-crime platforms) are far \"behind the will of the people\" when it comes to prison reform, according to Rep. Cory Williams, one of those DA candidates.\n\nThe numbers back him up. According to Pew research, Oklahomans across party lines favor alternative sentencing for non-violent offenders and shorter prison sentencing in general. More than 80 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of Democrats and 85 percent of independents also favor investing state money in treatment programs and stronger probation and parole options.\n\nPrisons in Oklahoma are at 113 percent capacity, and three-quarters of the inmates are locked up for non-violent offenses.\n\nOklahoma lags behind other red or red-leaning states when it comes to prison reform. Texas, Louisiana and Georgia have already made prison policy changes that have saved money and lowered incarceration rates including improving re-entry programs and diversion for non-violent offenders.\n\nCan an apology, 24 years later, make up for police botching investigation?\n\nThey called the woman a liar. They ignored evidence. They sat on the case. More than two decades later, they apologized.\n\nIt was 1994 when the rape victim, an African-American woman, was in New York City's Prospect Park.

According to a recent survey, 51 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 37 occasionally moonlight, and 38 percent make money from side hustles at least once a month.\n\nMoonlighting\u2019s mission is to help kickstart your freelancing journey and empower you to succeed in the gig economy. So whether you\u2019re looking for ways to boost your bank account, reach a financial goal, eventually become your own boss, or simply explore a passion outside your day job, we know there\u2019s never been a better time to start your own business!\n\nAnd while no one\u2019s path to figuring out his or her side hustle is the same, these tips can help set you up for side hustle success. Here\u2019s how...\n\n1.Brainstorm ideas\n\nWhat do you love? If your day job isn\u2019t focused on your passions, look at what you love to do outside of work. Your passion for dogs, the outdoors, cooking, or even socializing could translate into extra income.\n\nWhat are you great at? In today\u2019s hyper competitive market, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll stumble into success by just being \u201cgood\u201d. You are far more likely to succeed in your side hustle by embracing the core skills and expertise you\u2019ve spent a lifetime developing than by trying to learn as you go.\n\nWhat are other people already doing to make money? There\u2019s no point in starting a side business if it\u2019s not going to be profitable \u2013 it has to make money. So make sure there is a market for it. People often mistakenly think that because a niche is already competitive that it\u2019s too saturated, but that just means there\u2019s opportunity for money to be made in that space.\n\n2.Decide which idea to pursue\n\nHow flexible and scalable is your idea? Certain side work will demand steady commitment and regular hours while others allow you to scale your hours up and down. Both options can be useful for managing your debt or boosting your savings, the latter can potentially afford a better work-life balance. Keep in mind that if you take on a gig that\u2019s too rigid and doesn\u2019t allow you to take breaks, you might get burned out.\n\nWhat is your earning potential? Some gigs pay just $10 an hour, while others can pay more than $100 an hour. Pay rates will vary based on expertise, dedication, and demand. Decide what your time is worth and how much stress you\u2019re willing to take on. Then, limit your search to jobs that pay accordingly.\n\nDoes it fit your schedule? Some side hustles will allow you to work early mornings, late nights, and weekends. Others require more of a commitment. Think about when you will have free time on a regular basis. If you can only work weekends, focus on gigs that offer more flexibility.\n\n3.Plan, focus, commit\n\nPlan out weekly and monthly goals for the first six months of your side hustle. Start at the end and work your way backwards. If your end goal is to be making an extra $500/month from your side hustle in six months, then set a one-month goal, two-month goal (and so on) to meet specific income and growth targets. This plan for measuring success will help determine the direction to go in and keep you on track as you go.\n\nOnce you have decided on your side hustle, you\u2019ll need to commit. This means being disciplined to allocating your time and other resources to working on your side hustle every day. Even if it\u2019s just 30 minutes to 1 hour, do it every day. Stick to your plan and review it daily, going over your goals and plans so you don\u2019t get distracted.\n\n4.Launch and promote\n\nIt\u2019s time to let the world know you\u2019re open for business, so you\u2019ll need a place where you can be discovered and point potential clients towards learning more about you. Create a website, get on social media, and capitalize on freelance marketplaces like Moonlighting, where people are already searching for help with projects and gigs.\n\nReach out to your personal and social networks and don\u2019t be afraid to ask them to help share your new business with their networks and ask for referrals. Now that you are the boss you get to play all of the roles in your business, including marketing and business development. It\u2019s now up to you to find and land those gigs.\n\n5.Invest in growing\n\nOnce you start your side hustle, you\u2019ll have to invest some money to grow it. You\u2019re already investing your time, but investing money into marketing, education, and outsourcing is also part of growing your business.\n\nIn your early days, pursue free or inexpensive marketing opportunities. But as you find success you\u2019ll likely need to change tactics when you\u2019re ready to scale. What gets you earning $100/month won\u2019t necessarily get you to $1,000/month. Continue to be flexible and innovative with your marketing and promotions, and know when it\u2019s time to hire professionals to support your growth.\n\nMoonlighting can not only pad your income, but create career-changing opportunities that you wouldn't have normally stumbled upon at your full-time job. Are you ready to start your own freelance business or try out a few side gigs to get the feel of freelancing?\n\nNo matter what path you choose, kickstart your side hustle by joining the amazing community of freelancers, entrepreneurs, and gig workers on Moonlighting.

(Nov. 5) AP\n\nIn this Oct. 23, 2018 photo, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks to reporters at a news conference at the State Department in Washington. The Trump administration is calling for a halt to the civil war in Yemen, including airstrikes by the Arab-led coalition supported by the United States. Pompeo is urging all parties to support U.N. Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in what Pompeo says must be \"substantive consultations\" in November in a third country. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) ORG XMIT: WX108 (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Trump administration will allow Japan, China, India and five other countries to escape U.S. sanctions against Iran, even as those nations continue to buy oil from Iran in defiance of the White House\u2019s push to block all such sales.\n\nThe decision to grant eight exemptions \u2013 including to six of Iran's biggest oil-buying customers \u2013 sparked some criticism among hardline conservatives who are normally aligned with the White House.\n\nThe White House announced the exemptions Monday as part of its broader list of U.S. sanctions targeting Iran\u2019s oil, banking, shipping and other sectors. With Monday's action, the U.S. Treasury and State departments essentially blacklisted more than 700 Iranian firms and individuals.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to starve the Iranian regime of the revenue it uses to fund violent and destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East and indeed around the world,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a news conference on Monday detailing the sanctions.\n\nPompeo defended the decision to provide waivers to several U.S. allies, arguing that those countries were working with the administration to reduce their Iranian oil imports.\n\nIn addition to Japan, China, and India, Pompeo said the U.S. also would exempt these five countries: Italy, Greece, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. China is Iran's largest oil customer, followed by India, South Korea, Turkey, and then Italy, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nPompeo said those countries received temporary waivers \"in response to specific circumstances and to ensure a well-supplied oil market.\" The administration also included waivers for humanitarian needs, and it exempted three of Iran's civilian nuclear facilities from the sanctions.\n\nCritics say the new sanctions will hurt the Iranian people, not the regime, at a time when its economy is already reeling from a drop in the value of its currency and other problems.\n\nAs Iran braced for the new sanctions, the regime's top diplomat, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview over the weekend that his government would consider fresh diplomacy if the administration offered a new approach.\n\nAt the same time, however, Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, said the U.S. economic pressure would fail, and he vowed to \"break\" the new sanctions, which he called \"unjust and against the law.\" In remarks during a meeting with his economic ministry on Monday, Rouhani called the U.S. decision to exempt China and other countries a \"victory\" for Iran.\n\n\u201cThe fact that today, the United States exempts eight countries for buying Iran\u2019s oil, while it explicitly said that it will reduce Iran\u2019s oil sale to zero, is a victory for us,\" he said, according to remarks posted on the president's official website.\n\n\u201cWe are in an economic war situation. We are standing up to a bullying enemy,\u201d Rouhani told government officials in televised remarks, invoking Iran\u2019s ruinous 1980s war with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. \u201cYesterday, Saddam was in front us; today Trump is [in] front of us. There is no difference. We must resist and win.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Pompeo left the door to negotiations even as he used harsh rhetoric to describe Iran's regime and its malign activity.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian regime has a choice. It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble,\u201d Pompeo said at Monday\u2019s news conference.\n\n\"We hope a new agreement with Iran is possible,\" he said. But the regime would have to stop its ballistic missile program, halt its funding for terrorism, and take a bevy of other steps before such talks were possible, he said.\n\nThe sanctions announced on Monday were lifted by the Obama administration as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which barred Iran from seeking a nuclear weapon. President Donald Trump withdrew from that agreement in May, triggering Monday's sanctions snapback.\n\nTop Trump administration officials have for months vowed to drive Iran's oil exports to \"zero\" with this new round of penalties. Oil is Iran's largest source of revenue, and the administration has been lobbying other countries to wean themselves from Iranian crude.\n\nPompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. sanctions are the \"toughest\" ever imposed on Iran. But the U.S. is acting alone, unlike during the Obama administration when Russia, China, and other countries joined in a multilateral pressure campaign that led to the 2015 nuclear agreement.\n\nMonday's target list includes 50 Iranian banks, along with its national oil company and other pivotal entities. Pompeo said the the U.S. would also go after any companies or countries that do business with the blacklisted entities.\n\n\"If a company evades our sanctions regimes and secretly continues ... the United States will levy severe swift penalties on it, including potential sanctions,\" Pompeo said.\n\nSome critics have questioned how effective the new round of sanctions will be. Several Republican lawmakers have chastised the administration for offering waivers to China and other countries, arguing there should be no exceptions to the sanctions. They have also sharply questioned the administration's decision not to completely block Iran from an international financial messaging system known as Swift.\n\n\"The Ayatollahs will use such access to simply wait out the Trump administration, in the hopes that a future administration will be more appeasing,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a statement Friday.\n\nA New York-based advocacy group, United Against Nuclear Iran, said the administration \"caved\" in its decision to grant waivers. \"Whatever happened to maximum pressure,\" the group tweeted. \"They caved. Big time.\"\n\nWidespread waivers granted under Iran sanctions. Whatever happened to maximum pressure? They caved.

His trial is expected to last two to four months.\n\nFederal authorities have imposed high security to prevent Guzman from slipping away yet again. He's been held in solitary confinement in a high-security federal cell in Manhattan since January 2017, when Mexico agreed to allow his extradition to the United States for trial.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge was closed to traffic each time federal officials transported him from his cell for pretrial hearings at the federal courthouse near the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Brian Cogan has said he will try to develop alternative security logistics so the bridge would not be closed twice a day during the trial.\n\nThat led to speculation Monday that Guzman would be held in a special cell deep within the Brooklyn courthouse facility.

Prosecutors say the Sinaloa Cartel, named for Guzman's home state, smuggled more than 200 tons of cocaine into the United States.\n\nGuzman's lawyers say the allegations are based on the false testimony of killers and drug dealers.\n\nProsecutors say Guzman's operation earned more than $14 billion.

The dramatic escape triggered a worldwide manhunt that ended six months later in a deadly shootout in Los Mochis, a coastal city in Sinaloa.\n\nArely G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez, Mexico's attorney general at the time, said the search drew few valuable clues until Guzman reached out to actors and producers and began planning a movie about his life.\n\nThat tipped off investigators to his location.

It has therefore at no time been used in the context of Financial Fair Play.\"\n\nMediapart reported that Rybolovlev planned to inject millions of dollars of his own money into the club's accounts \u2014 in violation with UEFA rules \u2014 through the marketing deal signed in June 2014.\n\n\"AIM was to ensure the club received annual revenues of 140 million euros for a period of 10 years,\" Mediapart said. \"It represented an extraordinary sum - higher than the club's then-annual spending of 125 million euros, but also five times more than the value of the largest sponsorship deals secured by Real Madrid or FC Barcelona.\"\n\nThe online newspaper said that Monaco had registered losses up to 170 million euros over the three previous seasons and was at risk of being excluded from the Champions League.\n\n\"The plan was for the sum to be secretly provided by Rybolovlev, using an offshore arrangement that funneled the funds via the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong,\" Mediapart wrote. \"Thus Rybolovlev's funds would appear to come from a sponsorship deal, which would meet the requirements of UEFA's financial fair play rules.\"\n\nIn its response, Monaco denied any wrongdoing and said it wanted to increase its commercial resources and sponsorship through the deal. Monaco insisted the contract was real and included \"marketing resources, sponsoring but also all revenue related to the Champions League. The agency had to find 30 million euros in additional resources.\"\n\nAccording to Mediapart, the deal ultimately collapsed because of a dispute between Rybolovlev and the head of AIM, Bernard de Roos, who reportedly threatened to reveal the scam to UEFA. Monaco said it never went through because it proved to be \"too ambitious and unachievable.\"\n\nPlaced under investigation by UEFA's Club Financial Control Body for its overspending, Monaco reached a settlement in 2015 to pay a fine of 3 million euros, plus 10 suspended. Mediapart claimed that UEFA's investigatory chamber had opened an investigation into the AIM contract but that Monaco escaped heavy sanctions through a campaign of lobbying of Andrea Traverso, the head of UEFA's financial fair play program.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In red-state America, President Donald Trump is at the very heart of the GOP\u2019s closing campaign message.\n\nIn the Tennessee Senate race alone, Republicans ran over 11,000 broadcast TV ads last month featuring Trump, who is also a regular presence in GOP Senate ads in West Virginia, Montana, Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nBut in the purple states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada, the president is nowhere to be seen.\n\nRepublicans aired almost 13,000 broadcast TV ads in those three Senate races in the month of October, and Trump was mentioned in just three of them, according to data provided to the USA TODAY Network by the nonpartisan firm of Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nThe 2018 midterms are viewed by many as a national referendum on President Trump.\n\n\"These elections aren\u2019t really about specific issues,\" GOP pollster Dan Judy said. \"They\u2019re about Donald Trump. Everything is about Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut in the multi-million-dollar campaigns both sides are waging on television, his role varies dramatically from state to state and race to race, from omnipresence to utter absence.\n\nThe October breakdown\n\nA review of the broadcast TV advertising for the month of October found that 10 percent of all the ads aired in races for House, Senate and governor mentioned Trump.\n\nAbout 8 percent of GOP ads mentioned Trump, almost all positively.\n\nRoughly 11 percent of Democratic ads mentioned Trump, most negatively. But about one fifth of the Democratic ads that mention the president invoke him in a positive light. Most of those have been aired by Democratic Senators in red states that Trump won handily in 2016, such as Indiana, Missouri, Montana and North Dakota.\n\nWhile Trump is a dominating presence and issue in this year\u2019s election, both sides have invoked the president in limited and highly targeted ways in their broadcasting advertising.\n\nRepublicans have confined their mentions of Trump almost exclusively to very conservative states and districts, using the president to motivate their party\u2019s base while steering clear of Trump in places where he\u2019s either unpopular or simply divisive.\n\nA review of the ad data shows that 98 percent of the GOP ads for House, Senate and governor that mentioned Trump last month were aired in states or districts that Trump carried in 2016. And the vast majority were aired in places he carried by landslide margins.\n\nGarrett Bourg, 10, or Rome, Ga. poses like President Trump before a Donald Trump rally in support of U.S. Rep.

Bob Corker in Tennessee.\n\nTrump has been mentioned in GOP ads for governor in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Arkansas. And he has figured heavily in GOP House ads in some conservative blue-collar areas such as West Virginia\u2019s third district, where he appeared in every Republican ad.\n\nBut the party has avoided using Trump in most classic battleground states, including states that Trump carried narrowly in 2016, such as Wisconsin and Michigan. No GOP ads for House, Senate or governor mentioned Trump last month in Wisconsin, where Trump\u2019s approval rating has lingered in the 40s. None mentioned Trump in Ohio, a state he carried by eight points two years ago. Only a tiny handful mentioned Trump in Michigan. In Florida, only a few hundred of the more than 60,000 broadcast TV ads aired by Republicans in these races mentioned Trump.\n\nSenate GOP ads take on president\n\nWhere Republicans have mentioned Trump, it has been almost uniformly positive.\n\nOnly two Republicans in House, Senate or gubernatorial races across the country tried to create some distance from Trump on the airways in October, according to CMAG data, which does not include cable or radio ads.\n\n\u201cWhen I don\u2019t agree with what President Trump does or says, I\u2019ve said it,\u201d Rick Scott, the Republican challenging Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, says in a Spanish-language ad that aired at low levels. \u201cMy only commitment is with you.\"\n\nAlthough Scott was one of the first prominent Republican politicians in the nation to embrace Trump's candidacy in 2016, he\u2019s toned down his relationship with the president since running for the Senate \u2013 especially given Trump's attacks on Hispanics and crackdown on immigration. About one in six voters in the Sunshine State is Hispanic.\n\nIn heavily Democratic New Jersey, Republican Bob Hugin released a late ad telling voters he will stand up to Trump.\n\n\u201cMarines never back down from a fight,\u201d says Hugin, who is running against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez.\n\nMendendez responded with his own ad telling voters not to believe Hugin. It showed a picture of Hugin and Trump shaking hands at the White House, argued Hugin was silent after the president made \"racist comments,\" and highlighted Hugin's role as a top New Jersey fundraiser for Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nDemocrat ads vary on Trump\n\nThe use of Trump on the Democratic side has followed a more varied pattern.\n\nFirst, there are the red states where Democrats \u2013 facing tough bids \u2013 are linking themselves to Trump.\n\nIndiana Sen. Joe Donnelly has run the most \u201cpro-Trump\u201d ads of any Democrat in the country.\n\nThe first senator to run an ad this cycle showcasing approval from Trump, Donnelly is also making Trump a big part of his closing argument in a state the president is visiting twice in the final four days of campaigning.\n\nPositive references to Trump appear in more than half of the broadcast ads Donnelly ran in October.\n\nAs Donnelly splits a log in two with an ax in one ad, he brags about splitting with his own party to back Trump\u2019s border wall.\n\n\u201cYou look at the ads, and you almost think there are three parties running in Indiana \u2013 Republican, Democrat and independent,\u201d said Paul Helmke, an Indiana University civics professor. \u201cHe\u2019s running as an independent.\u201d\n\nScreenshot of campaign ad for Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind. (Photo: Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY)\n\nDonnelly ran more than 6,000 \u201cpro-Trump\u201d ads in Indiana last month. Senate Democrat Claire McCaskill of Missouri ran more than 3,000. Democrats in Senate races in red-state Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia have run numerous ads that mention Trump positively or tout their work with the president. Some Democratic Senate candidates, such as Phil Bredesen in Tennessee, have both criticized Trump and touted working with the president in their ads.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t personally like about Donald Trump,\u201d Bredesen says in one ad. \u201cBut he\u2019s the president of the United States and if he has an idea and is pushing something that I think is good for the people of Tennessee, I\u2019m going to be for it.\u201d\n\nIn another ad, he says he can work with Trump \u2013 \u201can experienced negotiator\u201d \u2013 to get drug companies to lower the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nIn many battleground states and districts, Democrats don\u2019t mention Trump at all in their ads, either because they think their base doesn\u2019t need the reminder, or they are trying to appeal to independent voters who voted for Trump or have mixed feelings about the president.\n\n\u201cOur candidates are not talking about the president very much,\u201d Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said on NPR. \u201cNo one is going to talk about Donald Trump more than Donald Trump ... We don\u2019t need to talk about him much.\u201d\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t mention Trump in their ads for governor and senator in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, where Trump won narrowly in 2016. They barely mention him in Michigan and Ohio.\n\nBut they\u2019re airing anti-Trump ads in battleground states such as Florida (for governor and U.S. Senate) and Nevada (for Senate). They\u2019re also attacking Trump in blue-state races such as the New Jersey Senate contest and races for governor in Oregon, California, Connecticut and Illinois.\n\nThe most concentrated anti-Trump ad campaigns are in vulnerable GOP House districts where Trump was outvoted by Hillary Clinton in 2016, such as California\u2019s 45th district in Orange County and Virginia\u2019s 10th district in the suburbs outside Washington D.C.\n\nEvery Democratic ad in both races last month attacked Trump and linked the GOP incumbent to the president.\n\n\u201cBarbara Comstock may as well be Barbara Trumpstock,\u201d says an ad in Virginia for Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton. \u201cChange is coming.\u201d\n\nContributing: Ledyard King and Herb Jackson, USA TODAY Network.\n\nMore: Young voter turnout in midterm elections is often dismal.

Right now, All-Clad is having a MASSIVE sale on their factory-seconds inventory that you absolutely don't want to miss. You just need to enter an email address to access the savings.\n\nIf you don't know about this brand, here's the scoop: All-Clad makes some seriously impressive stuff for your kitchen, from frying pans to full cookware sets to handheld tools to small appliances. Here at Reviewed, we've tested many of their pots and pans, never failing to be impressed by how well they perform. All-Clad was even our top choice when we tested all the best stainless steel skillets and performed very well among all the best cookware sets.\n\nThe one downside to this otherwise incredible cookware is that it comes at a pretty high cost most of the time. That's usually the reason we name a different brand our top choice in our tests. But thankfully there are opportunities to get All-Clad at much more affordable prices. A few times a year, All-Clad holds these factory seconds VIP sales, and the last one of the year is happening RIGHT. NOW. It's an amazing opportunity to save massively on all the All-Clad you could ever want.\n\nThis sale is, according to All-Clad themselves, their biggest sale of the year. You'll find some of the best sale prices yet on over 250 items. They're even discounting products from T-fal, KRUPS, and Rowenta to name a few. Our favorite stainless steel frying pan, usually $115, is listed in the sale for $65, and there are plenty of other options for similar or bigger discounts.\n\nSo what the heck does 'factory seconds\" mean? Don't let this phrasing put you off the sale. Factory seconds are just the inventory that got a little bit dinged up during production or in transit, but are still functionally perfect. Basically, since there's some minor cosmetic damage, they can't sell these items for full price even though it's the same thing that'll happen after a little normal use anyway. So instead, they run these sales every few months to clear out their inventory, passing on crazy good savings to everyone who would love All-Clad if it weren't so dang expensive.\n\nPrices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/05/you-can-get-all-clad-cookware-amazing-prices-right-now/38371219/", "An American Eagle CRJ-200 taxis to the gate at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in May 2014.

It would give Republicans and Donald Trump incentives to come to the bargaining table.\n\nThe Capitol in Washington. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nAs Election Day nears, America\u2019s political debate is spiraling downward into increasingly tribal politics, fueled by excessive rhetoric spread through cable news and social media. While President Donald Trump has undoubtedly intensified the harshness of the debate by rubbing raw virtually every division in our country, the crisis in American democracy started long before Trump became president, or even a candidate.\n\nThe Senate, once a crown jewel in our political system, is failing America. At its best, which many Americans still remember, the Senate was the place where the parties came together, through extended debate and super-majority requirements, to find common ground to move our contentious, diverse nation ahead. It was the Senate that broke the Southern filibuster to enact the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964; fiercely debated and ultimately brought about the end of the Vietnam War; held President Richard Nixon accountable for the abuses of power known as Watergate; and played a central role in every major piece of legislation to improve life in America, including Social Security and Medicare.\n\nFormer Senator and Vice President Walter Mondale aptly described it as \u201cthe nation\u2019s mediator.\u201d To former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, it was America\u2019s \u201cboard of directors.\u201d\n\nWe need the Senate to check and balance\n\nThat Senate has been absent for many years. In the 1980s and 1990s centrifugal forces in our politics began to erode the spirit of compromise at the heart of the Senate. The long, gradual decline of that body has turned into a deep dive into hyper-partisanship and mistrust. In the past two years, the nation most needed the Senate to be the check and balance on a chaotic administration led by an erratic, overreaching, potentially dangerous president. Instead, the Senate has given us scorched earth, partisan battles over immigration, health care, taxes and the Supreme Court, inflaming our divisions rather than seeking to overcome them.\n\nWe have worked in the Senate and studied it most of our lives. We are under no illusionsthat we can return to the political environment of an earlier era when the Democrats and Republicans were each more diverse and were less divided ideologically. There was no 24/7 media, or social media amplifying partisan conflict. The world in which that Senate existed cannot be fully replicated.\n\nMore: Latino voters like me need to grab our chance to push back against Trump\n\n10 reasons you should vote for Dems and against Trump in midterm elections. ASAP.\n\nLet's vote, party and celebrate American democracy on a new holiday called Citizen Day\n\nBecause we are Democrats, it may seem like an echo of that same partisan warfare, but we urge voters to demand those checks and balances. President George Washington, in his timeless September 1796 farewell address to the nation, warned, \"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.\" He emphasized, \"The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into different depositaries, and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others...\"\n\nWe believe that our present politics would be less acrimonious and more constructive if the party out of power, the Democrats, had the majority in the Senate, forcing President Donald Trump and the congressional Republicans to reach compromises. Rather than ramming through legislation and nominations on a purely partisan basis, with abuses of customs and norms which have made our democracy work, both parties would have greater incentive to come to the negotiating table.\n\nA Democratic Senate is best step forward\n\nHistorically, previous presidents \u2014 both Republican and Democratic \u2014 claimed important legislative triumphs when working with a Congress \u2014 and particularly the Senate \u2014 of the opposite party. Richard Nixon and a Democratic Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and strengthened the Clean Air Act. George H.W. Bush and a Democratic Congress worked out the Americans for Disabilities Act. Bill Clinton signed welfare reform and a balanced budget legislation working with a Republican Congress.\n\nThose experiences demonstrated, the wisdom of Mitch McConnell\u2019s observation that only the Senate could produce legislation which commanded broad national support because the legislation resulted from the parties working together. \u201cPeople are not elected to the Senate to get everything they want,\u201d McConnell wrote in his 2016 memoir, \"The Long Game,\" \u201cthis is not an all- or -nothing place.\u201d With a Republican president and a Republican Congress, McConnell has obviously changed his view, but he had it right the first time.\n\nControl of the Senate will turn on the outcome of six to eight races which are currently too close to call. The last thing our divided country needs is more fiercely partisan Republican warriors like Kevin Cramer in North Dakota, Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, Josh Hawley in Missouri, Martha McSally in Arizona, or Rick Scott in Florida to come to the Senate to join in the Republican leadership's unthinking support of the Trump effort to use a narrow majority to enact his extreme agenda by whatever means possible.\n\nWe recognize that our argument will not convince the many Americans who believe that these elections are only about supporting or opposing President Donald Trump. But for those voters who are deeply concerned about the level of partisan warfare and the increasingly dangerous rhetoric, whether Democrats, Independents or concerned Republicans, a vote for a Democratic Senate candidate is the most promising step forward for America.\n\nIra Shapiro, a former Senate staffer and Clinton administration trade official, is the author of \"Broken: Can the Senate Save Itself and the Country?\" Richard A.

(Photo: Cory Morse/The Grand Rapids Press via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 What's at stake?\n\nDemocrats warn that the midterm elections Tuesday will undermine the future of America's democracy unless President Donald Trump's authoritarian instincts are curtailed. Republicans argue that the nation's sovereignty is at risk if Democrats prevail.\n\n\"Fear is the dominant issue, bar none,\" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.\n\nThat's particularly remarkable because the economy is strong and the nation doesn't face an instant foreign policy crisis, although there are trouble spots around the world. Instead of a sense of peace and prosperity, the final weeks of the campaign have been dominated by violence and conflict: the mass murder of worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the mailing of improvised explosive devices to more than a dozen leading Democrats, the images of a caravan of Central American asylum seekers making their way across southern Mexico.\n\nThe campaign has crystallized clashing visions of what defines the nation: America First or an increasingly diverse population?\n\n\"The character of our country is on the ballot,\" declared former President Barack Obama, back on the stump in Miami.\n\n\"If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans,\" President Trump warned at a rally in Missouri, \"you better vote Republican.\"\n\nSince his inauguration two years ago, the president has united his party and inflamed the opposing one. Though he isn't on the ballot, he is at the center of both the conflict and its consequences. The midterm results will shape the second two years of his term and set the landscape for the re-election campaign that already is underway.\n\nMore: Election Day is almost here. Here's what you need to know before you cast your midterm ballot.\n\nAlso: Here are the candidates poised to make history Nov. 6\n\nRelated: These Democrats could make Trump's life miserable if they win the House in the midterms\n\nMost combustible midterm in a generation\n\nCalamitous language isn't exactly new to American politics, and the assertion that just about every election is crucial has become a political trope. But the 2018 midterms have been the most combustible in more than a generation. The arguments are fiercer and the lines more sharply drawn than even those marked by clashes over war (Vietnam in 1966, Iraq in 2006) and scandal (Watergate in 1974, impeachment in 1998).\n\n\"One electorate has its hair on fire and thinks that Donald Trump is a threat to the republic,\" Lawrence Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said of Democrats. \"For Republicans, there's an ominous warning about chaos, that the resistance movement will be the breakdown of law and order.\"\n\nBoth sides see \"cataclysmic scenarios,\" Jacobs said.\n\nOne sign of this year's high passions is the rise in early voting in states from Arizona to Wisconsin. By early Sunday, political scientist Michael McDonald of the University of Florida had counted a record 34.3 million people who had voted by absentee or mail ballot or at early voting stations. In the last midterm election, in 2014, 20.5 million voted early; this year's total may be close to double that.\n\nIn an incendiary closing argument, Trump spotlighted a web video created by his campaign that accused Democrats of complicity in the deaths of two California sheriff's deputies who were killed by an undocumented Mexican immigrant, who is shown mocking police in court. \"Who else would Democrats let in?\" the ad asks. (Court records show his case was handled primarily by Republicans.)\n\nCritics accused Trump of exploiting the nation's racial divisions, exaggerating the threat from undocumented immigrants and misusing the powers of his office by vowing to ban birthright citizenship by executive order and by dispatching thousands of military troops to the southern border to repel the immigrants' caravan, which \u2013 traveling on foot \u2013 is weeks away from reaching the USA.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., in line to chair the Homeland Security Committee if Democrats win control of the House of Representatives, called the president's threats \"a political stunt aimed at whipping up fear and xenophobia just days before the election.\"\n\nThe election returns will direct but won't dissipate the nation's political heat. If Democrats win a majority in the House, as nonpartisan analysts and strategists on both sides predict, they will gain the authority to launch vigorous congressional oversight of the Trump administration in general and the president in particular.\n\nDemocrats hope to win governorships held by Republicans in Rust Belt states that were key in electing Trump \u2013 Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A half-dozen other states that have GOP governors have competitive contests, from swing states such as Florida and Iowa to traditional Republican strongholds in Georgia and Kansas.\n\nVictories in state capitols will have repercussions for congressional redistricting after the 2020 Census and during the 2020 campaign, when presidential nominees could benefit from friendly governors' statewide standing and their political organizations.\n\nOne thing at stake in this election, then, is the next one.\n\nMore: Midterms: Races for governor, statehouses will help decide control of Congress for a decade\n\nA difference in battlegrounds\n\nTrump and other Republicans are increasingly optimistic that the GOP will maintain control of the Senate, perhaps even bolstering its 51-seat majority. \"I know we're doing well in the Senate,\" Trump boasted, though on Friday, he acknowledged for the first time that Republicans could lose the House. \"It could happen,\" he said at a rally in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nTen Democratic-held Senate seats on the ballot are in states that Trump carried in 2016, some by double-digit margins. That has put Democrats on the defensive in Indiana, Missouri, Montana and North Dakota, and it has made winning Senate control an uphill struggle.\n\nIn contrast, many of the most crucial House battlegrounds are in suburban districts where many college-educated voters, especially women, have been repelled by Trump's disruptive rhetoric and his hard-line policies toward immigrants and others. Democrats need a net gain of at least 23 seats to take control.\n\nThe split decision \u2013 if Democrats flip the House while Republicans hold the Senate \u2013 would give each side bragging rights. GOP partisans would focus on the Senate outcome as \"a huge validation\" of Trump, Charlie Cook of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report predicted, and Democratic partisans would argue that the House takeover was \"a huge repudiation\" of him.\n\n\"Everybody wakes up the next morning happy because they heard what they wanted to hear,\" Cook said.\n\nUp for election Tuesday are all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. Governors will be elected in 36 states and three territories, as will state legislators across the country. Mayoral contests will be held in 27 of the nation's 100 biggest cities, among them Louisville, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; Newark, New Jersey; Phoenix; Reno, Nevada; San Francisco; and Washington.\n\nMore: Young voter turnout in midterm elections is often dismal. This year could be different\n\nWhat's at stake for both parties?\n\n\u2022The power to probe. Democrats will get more than a gavel if they win control of the House. They'd gain the ability to set the agenda and the authority to convene hearings, call witnesses and issue subpoenas. Many of the prospective new chairmen already are making plans. At the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said he would investigate corruption accusations against Trump and allegations of sexual misconduct and perjury against newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he would pursue alleged fraud and abuse at the White House and in agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in line to chair the Intelligence Committee, said he would revive the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who interfered in the 2016 election.\n\n\u2022A Senate safety net. Maintaining Republican control of the Senate would make it easier for the White House to win confirmation of judicial nominees and officials in the Cabinet, where turnover is likely. It would make it harder for Democrats, even if they ruled the House, to pass legislation that Republicans didn't support or that put the White House on the spot.\n\nIn the most cataclysmic scenario for Trump, if the House considered articles of impeachment against the president, a GOP-controlled Senate could be a backstop in a trial over whether to remove him from office.\n\n\u2022The demography of democracy. The midterms have broken ground in the gender, race, religion and sexual orientation of candidates, mostly Democrats. Among the competitive races, Georgia could become the first state to elect an African-American woman as governor. Kansas and New Mexico could send the first Native American women to serve in Congress. Michigan and Minnesota are poised to elect the first Muslim women to Congress.\n\nAn unprecedented number of women have been nominated by the major parties for office this year, in part spurred by opposition to Trump and by the #MeToo movement. Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics reported records at every level: 23 female nominees for the Senate, 237 for the House, 16 for governor. Though women are partisans, to be sure, some academic studies found that female officeholders tend to govern differently than male ones. If the number of women in office significantly increases, they could change the issues that get traction and the way some political coalitions are forged.\n\nMore: 2018 midterms: Racial justice motivating factor for young voters of color, poll finds\n\nAlso: Midterm elections 2018: From climate change to conservation, environmentalists shift green battle to states\n\nThe democratic bargain\n\nFor some, this year's midterms raised fundamental questions about the way our democracy works, or doesn't work.\n\nLeon Panetta has a long perspective. He was elected to the House from California in 1976; served as President Bill Clinton's chief of staff through the Democrats' catastrophic midterm election in 1994; and joined President Obama's Cabinet in 2009, heading the CIA, then the Pentagon. The debate in the country today feels ominous to him, in his view a test of the need to restore checks and balances on the president.\n\n\"In the past, while there's been a lot of the politics and the ugliness we see today, I always felt it was, in the end, about the future of the country and what needed to happen,\" Panetta said. \"This one lacks that sense of where this country needs to go in the future, and it's more about trying to tear down the institutions that are there. It gives you the feeling that this country in many ways is at a real turning point.\"\n\nA study sponsored by the Baker Center for Leadership & Governance at Georgetown University found that Americans view even basic institutions through a partisan lens: Democrats tend to trust the FBI and the news media; Republicans don't. Republicans tend to trust the executive branch; Democrats don't. With a Republican in the White House, more than three of four Republicans say they are satisfied with how democracy works; fewer than half of Democrats agree.\n\nAnd there's this: One-third of Democrats and of Republicans say they believe members of the opposing party are a \"very serious threat to the United States and its people.\"\n\nThough some of the findings simply reflect the state of hyper-partisanship, political scientist Joshua Tucker of New York University said the risk is that \"common touchstones\" are being eroded and the basic bargain of democracy \u2013 that it's acceptable and to be expected that the other side will sometimes prevail \u2013 is being challenged. \"The percentage who think the other party never has the interests of the country at heart at all?\" he said. \"That is going to translate to making it harder to govern.\"\n\nThat would be after Election Day.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/05/midterm-elections-2018-donald-trump/1816824002/", "", "PSG's Kylian Mbappe, left, reacts with PSG's Neymar, celebrating after he scored his side's second goal during the League One soccer match between Paris Saint-Germain and Lille at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 Less than two weeks after its biggest loss under coach Diego Simeone, Atletico Madrid will get a chance to make amends.\n\nThe Spanish team will host Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday in the Champions League, 13 days after the Bundesliga leaders beat Atletico 4-0 in Germany.\n\nDortmund is unbeaten in 15 competitive games under coach Lucien Favre and can advance from Group A with another victory. An upcoming Bundesliga match against Bayern Munich on Saturday could provide some distraction, however.\n\nThe 4-0 loss on Oct. 24 equaled Atletico's worst result in the competition, while it was the team's first four-goal loss in 391 games with Simeone in charge. Despite the result, Atletico can also advance to the knockout stage with a win if Monaco draws with Club Brugge in the earlier group game.\n\nA look at the four Champions League groups on Tuesday:\n\nGROUP A\n\nAtletico is unfamiliar with big losses but can take heart after bouncing back in the past.\n\nThe team twice lost to city rival Real Madrid 3-0 in 2016-17, but responded with three wins and a draw on both occasions, while it claimed four consecutive victories after a 3-0 loss at Villarreal.\n\nAtletico has also only lost once (to Chelsea) in 19 European games at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, and the club hasn't lost at home to a German team in eight games since a 1-0 defeat to Dortmund in 1996-97. Dortmund went on to win the trophy that season.\n\nMonaco and Club Brugge have only faint hopes of progressing, each with a point from three games so far.\n\nMonaco is a far cry from the side that reached the semifinals in 2017. Radamel Falcao returned from injury to come off the bench in Saturday's 1-0 loss at Reims, which was a fourth match without a win for Thierry Henry since he took charge.\n\nGROUP B\n\nBarcelona visits Inter Milan with hope that Lionel Messi can return after recovering from a broken arm.\n\nMessi was expected to be out for another week or so, but he recovered well and practiced with the rest of the squad in recent days.\n\nMessi missed Barcelona's 2-0 home victory over Inter last month. He missed three other matches since breaking his right forearm in a league match against Sevilla.\n\nA win at the San Siro will guarantee that Barcelona advances to the next round as Group B winner. Barcelona has nine points after three matches, three points more than Inter, which can advance with a win if Tottenham and PSV Eindhoven draw in London.\n\nIt's win-or-bust for Tottenham, which has only one point and must defeat PSV to maintain any realistic chance of reaching the knockout stages.\n\nHopes of doing so rest on Erik Lamela. The Argentine forward has been involved in 11 goals in his last 12 appearances and scored in Saturday's 3-2 Premier League win at Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nGROUP C\n\nParis Saint-Germain may well need goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon at his best against Napoli, considering the form Dries Mertens is in.\n\nThe Belgium forward scored a hat trick in Friday's 5-1 victory over Empoli and has netted six goals in his past four matches, including one in the 2-2 draw at PSG.\n\nPSG is in third place with four points in Group C and needs to win, but it can also count on considerable firepower of its own in Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. They both scored against Lille on Friday with Mbappe taking his season's league tally to 11 in only eight games.\n\nPSG coach Thomas Tuchel has a big decision to make on whether to select striker Edinson Cavani against his former club. Cavani is PSG's all-time leading scorer but has fallen behind Mbappe and Neymar.\n\nGroup leader Liverpool needs to be more ruthless in front of goal at Red Star Belgrade, according to Juergen Klopp. The Liverpool manager was unhappy with his team's finishing in a 1-1 draw at Arsenal. But he may be worrying for nothing considering Red Star's defense has conceded 10 goals in three games.\n\nGROUP D\n\nPorto can close in on advancement with a win at home against Lokomotiv Moscow, which has three losses and only one goal scored.\n\nInjured forwards Jefferson Farfan and Fyodor Smolov are back in the Russian team's squad, though Farfan lasted only 45 minutes in the 3-1 win against Arsenal Tula on Saturday and Smolov was an unused substitute.\n\nPorto has hit form at the right time with five straight wins. The Portuguese champions have outscored opponents 17-3 in that run, which started after a loss to rival Benfica in the league.\n\nSchalke, which is two points behind Porto, hosts Galatasaray in the other group game. The Turkish champions are only a point behind Schalke and can look back on a 3-2 away win over the German team in 2013.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This is what we do not know yet and we will find it out,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the meeting with family members, Tjahjono had said that information downloaded from the jet\u2019s flight data recorder was consistent with reports that the plane\u2019s speed and altitude were erratic after takeoff on its final flight. Searchers are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nRusdi Kirana, Lion Air\u2019s co-founder, was not invited to speak by Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi, who moderated the meeting between relatives and the officials who are overseeing the search effort and accident investigation.\n\nBut he stood and bowed his head after angry and distraught family members demanded that Kirana, who with his brother Kusnan Kirana founded Lion Air in 1999, identify himself.\n\n\u201cLion Air has failed,\u201d said a man who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor in a district on the island where the flight was headed.\n\n\u201cI want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the time of the crisis, I was never contacted by Lion Air. We lost our child, but there was no empathy that Lion Air showed to us.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from reporters.\n\nMany families face an agonizing wait for missing relatives to be identified. Police medical experts have received nearly 140 body bags of human remains and have identified 14 victims.\n\nRelatives questioned why the plane had been cleared to fly after suffering problems on its Bali to Jakarta flight on Oct. 28 that included a rapid descent after takeoff that terrified passengers.\n\n\u201cLion Air said the problem was fixed, is it true the problem was cleared?\u201d asked Bambang Sukandar, whose son was on the flight. \u201cIf not, technicians in charge must be responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law is absolute, because they have stated that the plane was cleared to take off again. These bad technicians must be processed by law to prevent plane accidents from continuing in Indonesia.\u201d\n\nTjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the relatively small area the debris was found in showed the plane hit the water at a very high speed.\n\n\u201cThe plane was intact when it plunged to the sea, it did not explode in the air, and the aircraft engine was running when it touched the water at high RPM \u2013 it\u2019s marked by the loss of all blades of the turbine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan.

As someone who works full-time on mitigating the increasing polarization that divides our nation, I see intense disagreement every day. This was something else entirely \u2014 heartbreaking, appalling and shocking. These attacks and an increase in incendiary rhetoric have further exposed the festering divisions in our country. But they also spurred a bipartisan call for civility.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-AZ, expressed how we need to \u201ctone down the rhetoric. Both sides. We\u2019ve got to see people as opponents, not enemies.\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tweeted a statement saying, \u201cDespicable acts of violence and harassment are being carried out by radicals across the political spectrum \u2014 not just by one side. Regardless of who is responsible, these acts are wrong and must be condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike. Period.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, I will join Americans in voting for members of both chambers of Congress. In 36 states, my New York included, we are voting for governors as well. Only 38 percent of Americans say the United States is heading in the right direction, and an annual poll tracking discourse shows 93 percent say America has a civility problem. It is evident. The divisive, angry tone of our public discourse is increasingly dangerous and too often perpetuated by those we elect to public office.\n\nVote for those who will find common ground\n\nYour vote has the power to reverse the deepening abyss of destructive politics if you divert from voting along ideological lines and choose candidates who prioritize making progress on key issues over attacking the opposition. Cast a ballot for those who are not only capable of finding common ground, but who also seek opportunities to repeatedly reach across the aisle.\n\nIf we don\u2019t vote common ground before party, the pernicious effects of incivility following the midterm elections will only intensify.\n\nTo be sure, I am not advocating voting for \u201cnice\u201d people. The best leaders never compromise their fundamental principles. But our country needs leaders who are aware that their default approach needs to be finding common ground, not solely standing their ground. When they do dig their feet in on an issue, good leaders attribute their firm stance to their principles, not flaws in their opponent\u2019s character.\n\nAs you research candidates before heading to the polls, look for those with a track record that demonstrates a bias toward making progress on issues, not destroying the other side. Utilize the Lugar Center\u2019s Bipartisan Index and the Allegheny College\u2019s Prize for Civility in Public Life to learn more about politicians known for working civilly with their opponents to find common ground. Ask candidates to describe how they work with members of other parties to move forward on issues you care about \u2014 whether that is health care, guns or immigration \u2014 then cast your ballot for those you believe will work across party lines to solve those problems. In other words, vote common ground.\n\nMore: Bipartisan crusade against corruption? Elizabeth Warren, Ben Sasse could be leading edge\n\nWater Infrastructure Act is a bipartisan win for all Americans, from farms to cities\n\nWhy are we politicizing hurricanes, the environment?: Today's talker\n\nUse your vote to shift our political climate from destructive to constructive. Vote for candidates who understand that impactful and long-lasting solutions come only from a wealth of input from voices who bring different experiences and views to the table. Today, our politics are rooted in the mindset that the other\u2019s perspective is, at best, a \u201ccheck the box\u201d consideration. This approach is unproductive. Just look at how the Senate voted along party lines for the Affordable Care Act and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The minority party vowed to significantly change or repeal these bills once they resumed power. In the case of ACA, they did just that.\n\nWe need leaders in office who will stand tall on the two or three issues that matter most to them and their constituents yet prioritize working with others with differing views, not to check a box but because it is necessary to bring lasting change.\n\nHistorically, politicians have worked across party lines. President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich found common ground on welfare reform. Sens. John McCain and Russ Feingold joined forces in regulating the financing of political campaigns. Though harder to find, it\u2019s happening today, too.\n\nA Democratic gubernatorial candidate in South Dakota chose a Republican as a running mate. Ohio politicians reached across party lines to create the Congressional Civility Caucus so Congress can reach results, not fight. Politicians like Donna Brazile, Michael Steele, John Sununu and Barney Frank took part in public forums hosted by the Common Ground Committee, an organization I co-founded that inspires action on polarizing issues by bringing prominent leaders with opposing views together to find common ground.\n\nWe can still fix polarization\n\nWe are not past the point of no return. According to a recent study on polarization, 77 percent of Americans say the differences between us are not so big that we cannot come together. Regardless of your political affiliation, it is crucial you vote. Vote and help others vote common ground as well.\n\nIn a recent heated election, rather than vote for ideology, I made the decision to vote for the candidate who earned my respect for strength of character, and in previous positions, demonstrated an ability to work with opponents. Fighting along ideological lines has buried us deep in this political quagmire. Let\u2019s wield the power of our democracy and use our vote to move in a new direction, one that puts the country\u2019s need for common ground and progress before ideology and party.\n\nBruce Bond is co-founder of the Common Ground Committee, a citizen-led initiative focused on demonstrating productive public discourse.

USA TODAY\n\nKyle Vogt, founder of self-driving car company Cruise, which is owned by General Motors, stands in his company's San Francisco garage, home to some 180 Cruise autonomous cars currently testing throughout the city. (Photo: Marco della Cava, USA TODAY)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kyle Vogt was 14 when he saw the light, sitting behind the wheel of his father\u2019s car as it crossed the arrow-straight highways of the American Southwest.\n\n\u201cI had my learner\u2019s permit, and as I was driving from our home in Kansas to Las Vegas for a remote-controlled battle-bot competition and I thought, \u2018Surely this can be done by robots, just read the lane markers and keep the wheel steady,\u2019\u201d Vogt says with a laugh. \u201cSo that was the beginning.\u201d\n\nNearly two decades later, Vogt, 32, has made that epiphany his mission in life.\n\nAs founder and CEO of Cruise, a self-driving automotive tech company that General Motors bought for $1 billion in 2016, Vogt has sped to the front of the autonomous car pack thanks most recently to a big partnership deal with Honda.\n\nThere are dozens of car companies and tech startups tackling the self-driving car space, given that ride-hailing fleets with no drivers promise untold riches assuming tech costs and car ownership both decline.\n\nBut Cruise arguably has only one main competitor: Alphabet-owned Waymo, which has been at this for a decade, and for a year now has been busily testing hundreds of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans in Phoenix.\n\nMore: What's it like to run errands in a self-driving car? Some Phoenix regulars are sold on Waymo\n\nMore: Waymo will give shoppers rides to Walmart with its self-driving cars\n\nWaymo is aiming to make its beta-testing program public this year.\n\nCruise is aiming to start picking up passengers here in its Chevy Bolt-based self-driving cars sometime in 2019.\n\nVogt is vague on whether the program will be limited to a select group of riders at first, in an echo of Waymo\u2019s current beta program.\n\nBut he wishes to make one thing clear: Cruise\u2019s testing across this hilly, traffic-snarled city will ultimately yield more capable robot cars.\n\nThat\u2019s because since 2016, Cruise has deployed a small group of cars (at first 50, now 20) on what he describes as the comparatively easy-to-navigate streets of Phoenix.\n\nThe interior of General Motors' self-driving taxi, called the GM Cruise. GM expects to begin mass-producing the Cruise in 2019. (Photo: General Motors)\n\n\u201cJust look at construction zones, for one,\u201d Vogt says during an interview with USA TODAY inside a spartan conference room at Cruise, whose headquarters just south of downtown San Francisco seems as heavily guarded as Fort Knox.\n\n\u201cThose (zones) pop up 30 to 40 times more often for our cars in San Francisco than they did when we were testing our own cars in Phoenix,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means as an engineer working in Phoenix, you can just write that off as a problem. But we\u2019re dealing with that, with emergency services vehicles, with bicyclists. It\u2019s a lot more challenging.\"\n\nVogt also likes to highlight how the software and hardware in Cruise vehicles is fully integrated thanks to Cruise being wholly owned by GM, a comparison perhaps to Waymo's vehicle partnerships with Fiat Chrysler and Jaguar Land Rover.\n\n\"Look at these sensors, they've all got air- and water-cleaning nozzles built into the housing, and all the connections and wiring to our computers are auto-grade materials,\" he says during a brief tour of Cruise's cavernous engineering facility.\n\nOne floor down is another key part of the Cruise self-driving service plan: a room that has echoes of an air-traffic control center, with glowing screens and about a dozen workers on headsets.\n\n(Photo: General Motors)\n\nThis is where video and data comes in from a self-driving car that is momentarily stumped by its surroundings and is requesting remote-control help.\n\n\"The cars off-load to humans about 0.1 percent of the time during the (test) rides, but we still want to have this here to build trust with our users,\" Vogt says. \"Besides, if we're driving one mile, we want to get the maximum value, the maximum knowledge, from that mile.\"\n\nQuality, not quantity, of test miles\n\nMost mobility experts say that the race toward autonomy is not a winner-take-all proposition. In the end, much like the airline industry has big players like Boeing and Airbus providing planes for travelers to fly on, a few big companies will be making the self-driving cars that shuttle us around in the decades to come.\n\nBut in the short run, Vogt is indeed implying that the self-driving fleets that win over those early-adopters (polls show that half of respondents remain nervous about riding in autonomous cars) will be companies that have demonstrated an ability to handle extreme urban road conditions and, eventually, extreme weather.\n\nGiven that self-driving ride-hailing fleets remain largely a mobility vision of the future, the company that dominates this space will need brilliant minds and lots of money.\n\nWhile Waymo\u2019s funding appears unlimited, Cruise will have to keep an eye on its cash pile, says Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and self-driving expert with MIT AgeLab.\n\n\u201cAs part of Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Waymo has a limitless budget and no concerns about immediate financial returns. Cruise has GM\u2019s resources, the recent ($2.25 billion) investment from (tech investors) SoftBank, and now the Honda deal ($2.75 billion over 12 years). We\u2019ll see if it\u2019s enough,\" he says.\n\nA Waymo self-driving minivan. (Photo: Waymo LLC)\n\nVogt acknowledges that challenge and adds that the cost of a self-driving car ride has to come down quickly to guarantee enough consumer adoption to make the program financially viable.\n\nStartup and automaker combo\n\nCollaboration will be critical to that goal, says Karl Brauer, publisher of Cox Automotive. He says companies that go it alone in this space risk lagging behind.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s better than one automaker aligning with a tech company like Cruise? How about two automakers, GM and Honda,\u201d says Brauer. \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly impressive is that Cruise has avoided becoming a subdivision of GM. That could have torpedoed their success. But Vogt has steered clear of that.\u201d\n\nMore: GM, Honda to collaborate to deliver self-driving cars for 'global deployment'\n\nMore: 5 best freeway corridors for self-driving trucks\n\nVogt credits GM CEO Mary Barra with letting Cruise stay in San Francisco, where the company has been hiring feverishly \u2013 the company has 1,000 employees and expects to add hundreds more in 2019.\n\n\u201cMary came in and said, \u2018We know what you do is different, and we don\u2019t want to stifle that,\u2019 and that didn\u2019t come without risk on her part,\u201d says Vogt, noting that where GM\u2019s success is predicated on \u201cfollowing a game plan to the letter, we have to celebrate the failures as well as the successes, so it\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nCruise CEO Kyle Vogt, shown here speaking at a technology conference, made his first millions by selling video game streaming site Twitch to Amazon for nearly $1 billion, and later Cruise to General Motors for $1 billion. (Photo: Cruise)\n\nCruise\u2019s decision to use San Francisco to test its 180 Bolt-based electric cars \u2013 which in the future will be joined by a new Cruise-branded vehicle made jointly by GM, Honda and Cruise \u2013 hinged on that fact that urban centers, with their high Uber and Lyft usage, can support higher prices for those initial self-driving car rides.\n\nBut the calculus that drives Vogt and his investors involves a scenario where self-driving vehicles are circulating 24/7 in major U.S. cities and are charging a fraction of what a current Uber or Lyft ride commands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to draw your attention to the size of the market,\u201d Vogt says, eyes narrowing. \u201cThere are 3 trillion miles driven each year in the U.S. now, and Uber and Lyft only access about a half a percent of those miles, because having a human chauffeur you around is still very expensive, so most people prefer to have a car.\n\n\u201cBut when autonomous cars drive down that cost-per-mile number, and people decide to save on car and insurance and gas payments, we see us capturing 50 percent of those miles,\u201d he says. \u201cEven at a dollar per mile, when you\u2019re in the trillions of miles, that\u2019s big money.\u201d\n\nLooking for societal impact\n\nVogt adds that he\u2019s not in it for money. Rather, he decided five years ago that his next venture had to have a huge positive impact on society. The safety and ecological benefits of populating the planet with autonomous electric cars fit that bill.\n\nThe young entrepreneur certainly can afford to such idealism. After attending MIT, where he honed his robotics skills, Vogt detoured into the San Francisco startup scene, co-founding Justin.tv, which morphed into the video game streaming site, Twitch. Amazon bought Twitch in 2014 for $970 million.\n\nGM president Dan Amman, right, with Cruise Automation co-founders Daniel Kan and Kyle Vogt in 2016. Ammann led GM's effort to acquire Cruise and has overseen its growth since. (Photo: General Motors)\n\nVogt and his family (the couple has a 4-month old, \u201cwhich is all I do now when I\u2019m not at work 11 hours each day,\" he jokes) live in a $21 million Pacific Heights mansion and, by any measure, would be fabulously wealthy for centuries even if Vogt never lifted a pencil again.\n\nBut that prospect bores Vogt.\n\n\u201cLife is short as it is; you\u2019re only awake 16 hours a day,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a lot of people, a few hours of that is wasted each day commuting, just sitting in a car. What a waste of human potential. To get back your time, that\u2019s a gift. It's something worth working for.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Nation Writer @marcodellacava\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/05/gm-honda-cruise-founder-kyle-vogt/1819138002/", "CLOSE Multiple award-winning Chicago chef Stephanie Izard talks about a day in the life of a chef.

USA TODAY\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Harley Rouda (CA-48), left, greets supporters at a Latinx campaign canvass launch on November 1, 2018 in Costa Mesa, California. Rouda is competing for the seat against Republican incumbent Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. Democrats are targeting at least six congressional seats in California, currently held by Republicans, where Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election. These districts have become the centerpiece of their strategy to flip the House and represent more than one-fourth of the 23 seats needed for the Democrats to take control of the chamber in the November 6 midterm elections. (Photo: Mario Tama, Getty Images)\n\nThe economy isn\u2019t the biggest topic on Katherine Cousins\u2019 mind as Tuesday midterm elections draw closer.\n\nIt\u2019s the Trump administration\u2019s tone and policies, which she says have lowered the country\u2019s standing around the globe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about the election primarily from an economic standpoint,\u201d says Cousins, 45, who lives in Newburyport, Massachusetts. \u201cI\u2019m so shocked by how much our country has declined over two years in terms of what we stand for.\u201d\n\nYet she says the economy \u2013 specifically Trump\u2019s escalating trade war and the rise in health care costs \u2013 still ranks high and will be an important reason she\u2019s voting for Democratic candidates.\n\nHer view of the economy\u2019s role in Tuesday\u2019s vote captures the sentiment of much of the country on both the left and right of the political spectrum as voters digest the best U.S. economy and labor market in more than a decade.\n\nWith unemployment at a near 50-year low, the share of Americans mentioning the economy as the nation\u2019s most important problem was near the lowest on record in October at 13 percent, according to a Gallup poll. That\u2019s down from a peak of 86 percent during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 and as high as 53 percent in 2014.\n\n\u201cThis time around it may very well be, \u2018It is not the economy, stupid! It is other issues,'\u201d says Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u201cEveryone is pretty happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe average Joe and Jane isn't worrying too much about a recession,\" Yardeni adds. \"From their perspective, if they lose their job or quit a job they can go find another one.\u201d\n\nMore Money: Economy adds robust 250,000 jobs in October in last employment report before election\n\nMore Money: Here are the cities where the most people live alone\n\nMore Money: 'Colossal collapse' in gas prices expected heading into midterm elections\n\nYet the economy still ranked fourth among top election issues, behind health care, immigration and taxes, and the deficit, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll in October. That beat 14 other issues, from gun control to the opioid crisis.\n\nSeventy-four percent of voters \u2013 including 85 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of Republicans \u2013 say the economy is \u201cvery important\u201d to their votes, according to a Pew Research Center survey in late September.\n\nThis time, however, it\u2019s not all about jobs, jobs, jobs. The trade war, taxes, the impact of immigration policy on the labor market and rising health care costs were the top economic issues cited by voters interviewed by USA TODAY. Some voters appear not as deeply partisan as in past elections, saying they\u2019ll likely pick both Democratic and Republican candidates, depending on their stances on specific issues.\n\nTake a 'wrecking ball' to economy\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from casting the election in far more dire economic terms. \u201cAt stake in this Election is whether we continue the extraordinary prosperity we have achieved \u2014 or whether we let the Radical Democrat Mob take a giant wrecking ball to our Country and our Economy!\u201d Trump tweeted this week.\n\nAt stake in this Election is whether we continue the extraordinary prosperity we have achieved - or whether we let the Radical Democrat Mob take a giant wrecking ball to our Country and our Economy! #JobsNotMobspic.twitter.com/POhRivI1BZ \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2018\n\nThat warning doesn\u2019t square with many economists\u2019 analyses. Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase notes the federal tax cut passed late last year \u2013 which Trump touts as his biggest accomplishment \u2013 is a done deal and won\u2019t be modified even if Democrats gain control of both the House and Senate because the president would veto the measure. And Trump\u2019s rollbacks of many regulations were carried out by executive action rather than legislation.\n\nAll of the possible outcomes of the election are \u201cunlikely to generate legislation that would have a major economic impact,\u201d Feroli says.\n\n\u201cWe would guess if this election is a referendum on President Trump it is going to be more about the man's style, love him or hate him, the overall tone of his governance and less about what he has done in terms of policy or what measures he has taken to boost the economy,\u201d says Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, a Tokyo-based global bank with offices in New York.\n\nVoters worry trade war will cost jobs\n\nVoters do have concerns. Cousins is an executive with a consumer products company and frets that Trump\u2019s tariffs could sharply raise costs on the firm\u2019s goods made in China, battering profits.\n\n\u201cPeople at the company are really worried about their jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe trade wars are the best way to find compromise or common ground.\u201d\n\nOn health care, she says, \u201cI worry about rising costs and declining coverage. The U.S. should move to a system of universal health care ... and Democrats are more willing to take that on.\u201d\n\nThe economic ramifications of Trump\u2019s efforts to chip away at the Affordable Care Act are striking a nerve across the country, says Tom Block, a Washington policy strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors. \u201cPeople are concerned about losing parts of Obamacare, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nRay Tyc, 64, of Montgomery, Alabama, is a supporter of Trump and Republican candidates, and he, too, is focusing mostly on noneconomic issues \u2013 namely support for a pro-life ballot measure and candidates who back that amendment. \u201cI think the economy is going along quite well as it is,\" says Tyc, a postal clerk and retired Air Force officer.\n\nHe likes Trump\u2019s tough stance toward China, and that has helped solidify his support for Republican candidates.\u201dI think it needs to be handled,\u201d he says of China\u2019s trade and business practices.\n\nImmigration is also near the top of his list. \u201cWe are a nation, and we have to protect our borders,\u201d he says. Many voters fear immigrants will take their jobs, Rupkey says.\n\nTyc adds, however, \u201cWe need immigrants and their labor pool.\u201d\n\nEconomists say immigrants comprise large portions of the agriculture, construction and hospitality industries.\n\nTyc says Trump's crackdown on legal and illegal immigration is likely \u201cgoing too far.\u201d But he adds, \u201cIt needs to go too far at the moment. We need some bold moves on some of these things right now.\u201d\n\n'I'm voting on taxes'\n\nFor some Americans, economic issues don\u2019t divide neatly across partisan lines. Rick Vaccarelli, 67, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, says rising state and local taxes are making it tougher to meet expenses on his retirement income\n\n\u201cThis election I\u2019m voting on taxes,\u201d says Vaccarelli, a former vice president of sales. \u201cThey continue to spiral out of control.\u201d\n\nBut, the registered Republican adds, \u201cI will not be voting straight Republican.

Fear how their health care cuts will affect you and your family.\n\nIn Los Angeles on Feb. 25, 2017. (Photo: David McNew)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies would like the midterms to be a vote you cast based upon dread and anxiety. All his energy and much of the Republican Party's message have centered on playing to what GOP consultants see as your worst fears: A caravan of lepers coming to invade. Innocent men branded as sexual harassers. The government taking away your health care.\n\nAnd there\u2019s evidence this has worked for them. Film a TV commercial, set it to ominous music with dark shadowy figures, and exploit the biggest fear you can create. The 2010 campaign was about fear of death panels ready to sentence your grandmother to die. Didn't happen. In 2014, the government was going to let Ebola kill usall. That didn\u2019t happen, either. All of this was an offshoot of the Republicans\u2019 original Willie Horton formula in 1988, designed to scare the public into thinking the Democrats were set to parole dangerous criminals.\n\nI\u2019d love to tell you to vote your hopes, not your fears. That\u2019s how we will build a better country.\n\nMedicaid essential for elderly, opioid treatment\n\nBut if you are inclined to vote your worst fears, you should vote on the things you really have to fear, not what you\u2019re told to fear. Don\u2019t start with scary commercials but what politicians have actually promised to do if they win. One easy place to look for that is health care.\n\nThe Republicans, for example, have proposed shrinking Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Chief White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell both recently reiterated the party's desire for such cutbacks.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not an abstract fear. Medicare pays for health care for seniors, and Medicaid is the primary payer for more than six in 10 nursing home residents.\n\nBefore Medicare, Medicaid and other help for the elderly, more than half of seniors had no health insurance and 35 percent lived below the poverty level. Growing old couch surfing your relatives or living in your car, unable to afford to care for yourself \u2014now that\u2019s something to fear.\n\nMore: Medicaid expansion is popular. Dems should build on it in midterms and beyond.\n\nSanders: Trump and GOP want to cut Social Security. We should expand it instead.\n\nDonald Trump erodes Social Security and Medicare solvency while blaming Democrats\n\nMany Republicans, with help from Trump, are suing to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and make its consumer protections \u2014 guaranteed insurance for pre-existing conditions, a ban on lifetime limits and limits on insurance company profit limitations \u2014 illegal. Trump recently allowed states a variety of ways to duck the ACA law and offer insurance that doesn\u2019t cover mental health, cancer treatment, prescriptions or even lengthy hospital stays, and still call it insurance. Should they have the votes,Arizona Senate candidate Martha McSallysays the GOP will still aim for repeal.\n\nShould you fear Trump\u2019s and Republicans' repeated effort to repeal these protections? Consider this: 42 percent of Americans diagnosed with cancer burn through their life savings within two years.\n\nDeaths from drug overdoses are affecting all of us. Sadly, many of us have either been touched directly or know people who have been. Treatment exists for those who can be reached and can afford it, but it's hard to find. Today, a third of all treatment is paid for by Medicaid. Republicans would like to cut that program and require many recipients to showproof that they are working sufficient hours. Some evenpropose a drug test to qualify.\n\nCutting funding for treatment during an epidemic when seven people are dying every hour of every dayshould scare you. It\u2019s one reason why many across the country, including in red states such as Utah, Nebraska and Idaho, are pushing to expand Medicaid \u2014 not cut it.\n\nReal votes and proposals fuel health care fears\n\nThese fears of significant cuts to our health care system are all too real because they don\u2019t come from a scary political commercial put together by political consultants, but a multiyear voting record and live proposals from the administration and Republicans in Congress.\n\nA sound defeat of these ideas will not only lessen the fears faced by millions of Americans, it could also usher in reasons for hope. Hope that Trump receives a stinging message that his attempts to gut health care must stop. Hope that we can close the long chapter of trying to repeal the ACA and start working on commonsense solutions to reduce prescription drug costs and insurance premiums. And hope, ultimately, that we can find better, more comprehensive ways to make sure everyone can afford health care.\n\nIf Americans vote their fears on Tuesday, it may just work out differently than the fearmongers think.\n\nAndy Slavitt, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

A team that was expected to be among the Eastern Conference contenders is only 6-5, and the 76ers are 0-5 outside Philadelphia.\n\n\"We are not, right now, at this present moment, amongst the royalty in the East and we understand that,\" coach Brett Brown said. \"And it's a badge that we want. It's in us. But at this moment, after 11 games, that's not where we are. And that's OK.\n\n\"This group does have fight, this group does have pride and we will find a way to move on, move up, move forward and that's my job.\"\n\nThe 76ers were routed at Toronto, Milwaukee and Boston, but those are three of the top teams in the conference. The loss in Brooklyn, their most lopsided of the season, was such a pitiful performance \u2014 Brown called it \"unacceptable\"\u2014 that the coach made sure to stress that it was an outlier for his team.\n\nThe 76ers handed the Nets 39 points off their miscues, which contributed to Brooklyn's whopping 40 more shot attempts.\n\n\"It's not Golden State. We shouldn't lose a game to Brooklyn by that many points,\" said Joel Embiid, who finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds but got only eight shots and was pulled midway through the fourth quarter. \"We didn't compete.\"\n\nBrown knows the Sixers have to change their ways to have any success away from home.\n\n\"To win on the road, you better not turn it over at the rate that we've been turning it over. You better have an incredible focus on rebounding,\" Brown said. \"Historically, like, those are the tenants of road wins.\n\n\"And I think that togetherness, that toughness, the ability to take punches and still come out on the other side, that is part of growth. We don't have that right now.\"\n\nPhiladelphia was 22-19 on the road last season, when it won its last 16 games overall and went 52-30 before reaching the second round of the playoffs behind Embiid and Ben Simmons.\n\nThat strong finish has been followed by a shaky start, and players agreed with Brown's tough talk about their effort Sunday. But he insisted afterward the 76ers wouldn't overreact and would move on.\n\nThey'll try to do that Wednesday at Indiana, another team ahead of the 76ers in the East. A victory smooths out a rough road that's left them puzzled.\n\n\"I don't know what it is,\" Simmons said, \"but I think we just need to step it up.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTom Brady didn't have to beat Aaron Rodgers in only their second head-to-head matchup to prove he's the best quarterback of all time.\n\nThe GOAT did it, anyway.\n\nBrady threw for 294 yards and one touchdown to lead the New England Patriots to a 31-17 victory over Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night.\n\nRodgers had 259 yards passing and two TDs.\n\nIt wasn't a vintage performance for either quarterback. Brady tossed six straight incomplete passes at one point, and he couldn't get the Patriots in the end zone on four tries from the 1 with the score tied in the third quarter. Still, he posted a passer rating of 99.0 on a night when he didn't have star tight end Rob Gronkowski and leading rusher Sony Michel.\n\nThe game was billed as the most talented QB vs. the most accomplished QB. Some considered that statement a slight against Brady. It's not. Rodgers is immensely gifted with a strong, accurate arm and scrambling ability. He makes plays with his legs that Brady can't. He makes throws few players ever could make, whether he's on the run like the 24-yard pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling on a third-and-1 late in the third quarter, or if he's flat-footed, falling down, throwing across his body or heaving desperation passes into the end zone.\n\nBrady has a different style. He's a drop-back passer with underrated pocket mobility and perfect mechanics, and he simply outsmarts everyone else on the field. He fooled a pair of defenders with his eyes by looking as if he was throwing a screen pass and instead fired deep for a 55-yard TD pass to Josh Gordon to seal the win.\n\nBut John Elway and Steve Young also belong in the \"most talented\" conversation, so it's not even a slam dunk that title belongs to Rodgers. Michael Vick wasn't nearly as well-rounded, but he could throw a 70-yard touchdown pass with a simple flick of his left wrist or he could sprint 70 yards for a score at any point in a game. He has a case for the \"most talented\" debate if it's based purely on physical skills. It won't be long before Patrick Mahomes has to be considered, too.\n\nHowever, the \"greatest of all time\" argument ended when Brady rallied the Patriots from a 28-3 third-quarter deficit against the Falcons to win his fifth Super Bowl title on Feb. 5, 2017.\n\n\"He's got five championships,\" Rodgers said earlier in the week when asked the GOAT question. \"I think that ends most discussions.\"\n\nRodgers is one of the best to play the game and he may be the \"most talented,\" but he doesn't belong in the \"greatest of all time\" conversation. It's Brady. Then Joe Montana. Peyton Manning deserves a mention. So does Drew Brees.\n\nBrady has eight Super Bowl appearances. He won his third regular-season MVP award last year at age 40 and he has four Super Bowl MVP awards in his trophy case. He's still at the top of his game at 41, seven years older than Rodgers.\n\nOver 19 seasons, Brady has set numerous records and he notched another milestone against the Packers when he surpassed Manning for the most combination passing, rushing and receiving yards in the regular-season and playoffs.\n\nSo while the Sunday Night Football crew enjoyed hyping the matchup and even got Michael Jordan involved by having the six-time NBA champion record a promo saying \"the best way to settle this debate is to play it out head to head,\" Brady already earned the title way before helping New England (7-2) to its sixth straight win.\n\nBrady is the greatest quarterback of all time and he's still proving it every week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The NBA is on pace this season to make about 27,300 shots from 3-point land.\n\nNow, not even three full weeks into this season, five teams have broken their own franchise record for 3s in a game. The most recent entry into that club was Milwaukee, which connected on 22 3s \u2014 on 56 tries, as opposed to 39 from inside the arc \u2014 in its 144-109 win over Sacramento on Sunday. The Bucks used 13 players, with everyone trying at least one shot from 3-point range and 11 connecting on at least one triple.\n\nIt was the second time this season the Bucks tried more 3s than 2s.\n\nNumber of times in Bucks history that happened before this season? Zero.\n\n\"We'll just hopefully keep pushing that record, whatever it is,\" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \"See if we can get more. ... Good for us to know that we're pushing that envelope and we want to be great behind that 3-point line.\"\n\nThe Bucks aren't alone in their quest for 3-point greatness.\n\nBoston, which has had 3-point stars like Larry Bird, Paul Pierce, Antoine Walker and Allen in its rich history, made a team-record 24 3-pointers last week against the Bucks. The Celtics came into this season with 19 3s in a game being their franchise mark; they've made 19 or more twice already this season.\n\n\"We took what the defense gave us,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after the barrage of 24 3s.\n\nFueled by Thompson's 14 3s in Chicago, the Warriors set a team record that night with 24 makes from deep. Atlanta set a team mark with 22 3-pointers against Cleveland, and Utah connected on its record of 19 in a loss to Golden State.\n\n\"This is the NBA right now,\" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nCurry is shooting more 3s per game than ever, making more 3s per game than ever \u2014 and doing it more accurately than ever. He's already made 59 3s through the Warriors' first 10 games, and is shooting 51 percent from deep.\n\nCurry is fifth all-time in 3-pointers made with 2,188. Allen is the record-holder with 2,973, a mark Curry is on pace to get in about two years.\n\nMUST GET 100\n\nIn this NBA, if a team doesn't score 100 points, they're not winning.\n\nThen again, getting to 100 doesn't guarantee anything either.\n\nTeams that score 100 points or more are 134-99 this season, meaning they win 57.5 percent of the time. Those who don't score 100 are 5-40, or winning 11.1 percent of the time.\n\nThat's a big change from recent years.\n\nLast season, teams over 100 won 62.2 percent of the time, and teams that didn't score 100 won 20.8 percent of the time. A decade ago, those scoring 100 won at a 69.4 percent clip, and those not reaching the century mark won 30.8 percent of the time.\n\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\n\nA six-pack of games to watch this week ...\n\n\u2014 Minnesota at L.A.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Only days after he stood up to key players for turning up late to a team talk, another incident underlined how Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel needs greater backing from his club over disciplinary issues.\n\nTuchel felt let down by midfielder Marco Verratti, who was stopped by police for driving over the alcohol limit late Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\n\"It's not possible to do that two days before a match, what he did isn't good,\" Tuchel said after Friday's 2-0 home win against Lille. \"In my opinion it's something for the club to regulate. The club needs to regulate this because I need to control the dressing room and sporting things.\"\n\nTuchel already has his hands full in the Champions League, and he can't afford being distracted by player ill-discipline.\n\nBut twice within the space of a few days, his patience was tested. This, with a huge game coming up at Napoli on Tuesday, when defeat could leave PSG perilously close to elimination from the Champions League group stage.\n\nThe previous weekend, Tuchel left out star striker Kylian Mbappe and midfielder Adrien Rabiot for turning up late to a pre-match team talk before the game at Marseille.\n\nFive days after being dropped, Mbappe arrived at the stadium for Friday's home game against Lille wearing a face mask from a Netflix series. So did Neymar, walking ahead of him.\n\nWith Tuchel at pains to insist the French league is not too easy for PSG despite 12 straight league wins, star players arriving wearing masks before playing against a team sitting No. 2 in the league sends out the opposite message \u2014 and one of domestic complacency.\n\nWould they do the same for a big game in the Champions League, for example?\n\nWhat Tuchel really needs is a better response on the field in big matches. Key players lacked composure against Napoli in a 2-2 home draw last month, scraping a draw late into injury-time. It left PSG on four points from three matches, with Champions League runner-up Liverpool still to visit PSG.\n\nSimilar frailties, in terms of attitude, were exposed last season against defending champion Real Madrid in the last 16.\n\nA little more than a week before the first leg in Madrid, Neymar threw a lavish birthday party with about 250 guests present, including the club's president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and then-coach Unai Emery.\n\nVideos of the players partying and dancing late circulated on social media. The videos angered Sochaux captain Florian Tardieu, who said it was a lack of respect since PSG was playing Sochaux in a French Cup game 48 hours later.\n\nEmery said at the time: \"It's good for our collective mindset to have shared this moment with Neymar.\" Then his team lost 3-1 in Madrid and 2-1 at home.\n\nThere was a perceived lax code of conduct behind the scenes at times last season, with striker Edinson Cavani and midfielder Javier Pastore rebuked by captain Thiago Silva for returning late from the mid-season winter break.\n\nTuchel is not the only coach who has been faced with star power at PSG. In previous seasons, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was allowed days off to go hunting in Sweden.\n\nComplacency has also been a problem.\n\nIn 2017, PSG routed Barcelona 4-0 at home.\n\nThen, two days before the return leg, the club released a video on YouTube called \"Supper Club\" with four players sitting around a table. As they ate pizzas and slurped soft drinks, former midfielder Blaise Matuidi and Verratti were joined by Julian Draxler and Thomas Meunier.\n\nThey discussed the game ahead.\n\n\"The first 20 minutes are going to be tough, eh Marco? The field is really big,\" Matuidi said.\n\nDraxler told Matuidi \"You will need to run a lot\" and they both laughed when Matuidi retorted: \"I'll need you to as well.\"\n\nThe casual tone smacked of taking Barcelona lightly. PSG lost 6-1, becoming the first team in Champions League history to go out after winning the first leg by four goals.\n\nTuesday night will be another test of PSG's composure on the biggest stage.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe first football weekend of November featured salivating matchups, division foes facing off in key races, and a historical showdown of two of the game\u2019s best to ever play.\n\nHere are the Week 9 winners and losers:\n\nWinners\n\nTom Brady: He lost the first matchup against Aaron Rodgers in 2014, but he comfortably took the second, as the Patriots beat the Packers, 31-17, in a showdown that didn\u2019t quite live up to the hype. Still, it was a victory in which his connection with receiver Josh Gordon (five catches for 130 yards and one score) took the next step. That Brady and the offense clicked despite not having tight end Rob Gronkowski, running back Sony Michel and guard Shaq Mason showed that New England is steadily improving as the year wears on. In fact, with the game tied at 17 after three quarters, Brady posted a perfect passer rating of 158.3 in the fourth quarter on 6-of-6 passing for 104 yards and one touchdown. Now, the Pats are 7-2 and keeping pace with the AFC-leading 8-1 Chiefs.\n\nNew Orleans Saints: A masterful five-for-five day in the red zone sparked the Saints to a massive 45-35 victory against the previously undefeated Rams. Running back Alvin Kamara tied a career high in touchdowns (three) before halftime. Drew Brees was surgical. New Orleans\u2019 defense stepped up and its offense \u2014 behind Brees, Kamara, receiver Michael Thomas and coach Sean Payton\u2019s innovative play calling \u2014 might be the most dangerous in the league. This game could very well be a tiebreaker that determines home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. And in the Superdome, the Saints are close to unstoppable.\n\nBrees finds Michael Thomas for the dagger! #LARvsNOpic.twitter.com/yhayoE2tEz \u2014 New Orleans Saints (@Saints) November 5, 2018\n\nWinners of division games: Four of the seven early slate games were between division opponents, and in particular, victories for the Steelers (over the Ravens), Panthers (over the Buccaneers) and the Vikings (over the Lions) were pivotal for their playoff runs. With the Bengals on bye, Pittsburgh (5-2-1) snuck into first place. With the Saints' win over the Rams to move to 7-1, the Panthers (6-2) needed to keep pace in the NFC South and wild-card chase. And Minnesota \u2014 thanks to a franchise-best 10 sacks against Matthew Stafford \u2014 now has a chance to potentially claim first place in the NFC North after its bye next week when it faces the division-leading Bears in Week 11.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: They lost two of their first three games, but have now won five in a row \u2013 after beating the Seahawks, 25-17, on the road \u2014 for their best start (6-2) since 2006. Quarterback Philip Rivers is efficiently spreading the ball all over the field, running back Melvin Gordon is carrying the load and the defense is improving with each week \u2014 even without defensive end Joey Bosa, who is nursing a foot injury. If it wasn\u2019t for the Chiefs and their blazing start to the year, more people would be talking about the Chargers. But make no mistake, they\u2019re a team to worry about down the stretch. Now, if they could only fix their kicking woes.\n\nPANIC BUTTON? Ravens might need to consider drastic changes\n\nRAZZLE-DAZZLE: Patriots get creative to separate from Packers for win\n\nFLIP PHONE FUN: Saints WR replicates Joe Horn's famous cellphone celebration\n\nLosers\n\nBaltimore Ravens: They\u2019ve now lost three in a row and four of the last five after dropping their game against the Steelers, 23-16. An NFL Network report suggested coach John Harbaugh could be fired soon. Baltimore\u2019s deep passing game that helped it burst to a hot start this season disappeared and its defense has yielded a steady stream of explosive plays over the past several weeks. The Ravens can move on from quarterback Joe Flacco at the end of the 2019 season, Eric DeCosta will replace Ozzie Newsome as general manager at the end of this year, and if a coaching change does come down, this could be a team in a full rebuild.\n\nDirk Koetter: He fired his offensive coordinator, benched his supposed franchise quarterback, and even went for a fake punt that failed from the Buccaneers\u2019 own 26-yard line in a 42-28 loss against the Panthers. Koetter appears to be trying anything to spark some change, but nothing is working. Turnovers (the Bucs committed two, didn\u2019t force any and have the league\u2019s worst TO margin at minus-15) continue to be an issue, Tampa fell to 3-5, and Koetter looks more and more like a head coach whose job is in danger.\n\nNew York Jets: Speaking of coaches potentially in danger of losing their jobs, Todd Bowles\u2019 Jets looked lifeless again in a 13-6 loss against the Dolphins. In particular, it\u2019s New York\u2019s offense \u2014 and the stagnant development of rookie quarterback Sam Darnold \u2014 that\u2019s troubling. The Dolphins picked Darnold four times (one of which was returned for a TD) and prevented him from throwing a score. In the past three games, Darnold has thrown just two touchdowns versus seven interceptions. His 14 interceptions are most in the NFL. He looks uncomfortable in the pocket and his struggles are sending the Jets plummeting down the AFC East.\n\nRedskins\u2019 defense: They entered Week 9 ranked fourth in the NFL in total defense (322.4 yards a game), second in rushing defense (80.1 yards a game), and fifth in scoring defense (19.1 points a game). By early in the third quarter of its 38-14 loss against the Falcons, Washington allowed Atlanta to eclipse all three of those figures. The Falcons finished with 491 total yards and 154 rushing. Cornerback Josh Norman was exploited all game long, and Washington\u2019s dud could be disastrous. If the Cowboys win Monday night, both Dallas and the Eagles \u2014 who were on their bye \u2014 would be just one game back in the NFC East.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

As John Harbaugh rumors grow, Ravens might need to consider drastic changes\n\nMore: Patriots get creative to separate from Packers for win\n\nLegendary would best describe both Thomas\u2019 body of work (12 catches on 15 targets for a franchise-record 211 yards and a touchdown) and the offensive output of the Saints\u2019 and Rams\u2019 tilt. The teams combined for 80 points and 970 yards while confirming their reputations as two of the league\u2019s elite teams.\n\nAfter trading touchdowns to start, the Saints scored 21 straight points to take a 35-14 lead. But the Rams countered with their own barrage to tie the game at 35-all with nine minutes left to play.\n\nFor all the attention on each squad's offense, the contest came down to a handful of defensive performances - not from the star-studded unit in which the Rams have invested so heavily, but rather from the less-heralded Saints.\n\nFor New Orleans, three second-quarter stops paid off in a big way.\n\n\u201cThat turned the tide in our favor,\u201d Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan said.\n\nDuring that swing, the Saints notched a turnover on downs and then snagged an interception. New Orleans\u2019 offense then cashed those possessions in for three straight touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWe talk about the ability of our defense to make those turnovers,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were emphasizing all week. We let them get a couple big plays that we would like to take back, but we have another week to make those corrections. \u2026 As for this one, we got a turnover and made a couple stops.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what they needed.\n\nJordan and his defensive teammates certainly established credibility with their strong second quarter and the manner in which they closed the door on Los Angeles' offense late in the fourth quarter. Coming out on top is sure to bring the team as a whole more attention, too.\n\nDespite the six-game win streak they brought into Sunday's game, the Saints remained somewhat in the shadow of the previously unblemished Rams.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s victory proved that the Saints actually are the more complete of the two and just might be the most complete team in the NFC as a whole.\n\nBoth sides are led by brilliant offensive-minded head coaches (Sean Payton and Sean McVay), with each leader creating opportunity after opportunity with their play calls. And both have talented quarterbacks, although Brees is a future Hall of Famer and Jared Goff is still ascending.\n\nBut it became apparent that the Saints hold the edge over the Rams in several key areas.\n\nThe Saints' offensive front surrendered only one sack and paved the way for 141 rushing yards. And while Todd Gurley is a MVP candidate, New Orleans found ways to limit his impact (19 touches for 79 total yards). Alvin Kamara (116 total yards and three touchdowns) and Mark Ingram, meanwhile, give the Saints a versatile tandem that makes for the league's most complete rushing attack. A defense may find a way to limit one, but it\u2019s hard to take away both.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Thomas, whose twitter handle is rightfully @Cantguardmike. The Rams have nice weapons, but none of their wideouts can match the Saints' top option. Fortunately for Los Angeles, however, McVay can scheme his receiving options open.\n\nBut the Rams do have areas to address, particularly on defense where they\u2019re missing top cornerback Aqib Talib and still need better play from their edge rushers. The Saints exposed these vulnerabilities.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say these issues will remain come January, when these teams could meet again in the playoffs. But for now, the NFC\u2019s road to the Super Bowl runs through New Orleans.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "Chelsea's Alvaro Morata celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the English Premier League soccer match between Chelsea and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge stadium in London, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Just a month ago, Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata wore a dejected expression and looked bereft of self-belief.\n\nUnreliable with his back to goal and the ball at his feet, it seemed as though Chelsea playmakers Eden Hazard, Willian and Pedro preferred to work with the steadier, less combustible figure of Olivier Giroud as a target man up front.\n\nThere was media speculation that Chelsea, uncertain whether it could maintain its English Premier League title challenge with a non-goalscoring center forward, would be offloading Morata in the January transfer window.\n\nThe transformation has been extraordinary in the last four weeks.\n\nMorata appeared sharp, busy and hungry on Sunday as he took his tally to four goals in four league games, one more than in his previous 23 games in the competition, with two goals in Chelsea's 3-1 win over Crystal Palace.\n\n\"I am really very happy for Alvaro,\" Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri said. \"He improved in the last month in confidence and personality. He improved also from a tactical and technical point of view.\"\n\nSarri believes Morata is finally showing the form that persuaded Chelsea to pay a club record fee of about 60 million pounds ($78 million) to tempt the Spanish striker away from Real Madrid 18 months ago.\n\n\"Potentially he can be (a top striker),\" Sarri said. \"He has great potential physically and technically. He can improve more. Sometimes he is a little bit fragile.\"\n\nHazard also seems delighted with Morata's recent resurgence. The Belgium forward sported a wide grin when he hugged his teammate after producing the free kick that led to Morata's second goal against Palace.\n\nMorata almost ended up with three goals but was unable to lift the ball over Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey when he went clean through in the closing stages.\n\n\"I could have scored a hat trick, so it was not the perfect day,\" Morata said. \"I am improving and I want to keep helping my team to win. It is very hard because the Premier League is the most competitive league in the world. When you have a bad period, it takes long to recover. But now I am good. It is nice to be scoring.\"\n\nHIGH HOPES\n\nFormer Manchester City manager Mark Hughes knew his Southampton team was in deep trouble at the Etihad Stadium when two of the opposition's smallest players were coming out on top in aerial duels in attacking areas.\n\n\"When you've got David Silva and Raheem Sterling winning headers in your own box, that cannot happen,\" Hughes said after Southampton was crushed 6-1 by league leader City.\n\n\"Seeing that I thought, 'Come on, we need to be more aggressive, more determined, in our defensive play.' That was a frustration for me because we talked a lot before the game about what we were going to do, but very quickly our game plan went out of the window.\n\n\"City ask different questions of you, they keep knocking on your door and they pick you off. You can come here and put everyone behind the ball and try to see out 90 minutes, but I've done that before and still got beaten.\"\n\nIt was the 12th time that City has scored five or more goals in a league game since Pep Guardiola took over as manager 2 1/2 years ago. No other team has achieved the feat on more than six occasions in the same time.\n\nSergio Aguero became the ninth player to score 150 Premier League goals when he netted against Southampton. It came in his 217th appearance and only Alan Shearer, in 212 matches, has reached the landmark in fewer games.\n\nThe other eight to have netted 150 Premier League goals are: Shearer (260 goals), Wayne Rooney (208), Andy Cole (187), Frank Lampard (177), Thierry Henry (175), Robbie Fowler (163), Jermain Defoe (162) and Michael Owen (150).\n\n___\n\nMore AP English soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/PremierLeague and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Cam Fowler joked it had been a long, long time between scoring hat tricks.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks couldn't have been blamed for feeling that way about winning, too.\n\nFowler completed his first career hat trick 36 seconds into overtime to help the Ducks end a seven-game losing streak, 3-2 over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday night.\n\n\"It was a product of being in the right place at the right time tonight, and I'll take it,\" the defenseman said. \"I'm not complaining, but the main thing is our team found a way to win the game and kind of find a way to get off this losing streak.

Joonas Korpisalo made 27 saves.\n\nFowler scored on a one-timer from Adam Henrique to end Anaheim's losing skid. It was Fowler's 56th career goal, tying Francois Beauchemin for second-most by a Anaheim defenseman all-time.\n\nFowler also became the seventh defenseman in NHL history to cap a hat trick with an overtime winner. Anaheim defensemen are responsible for the past three such hat tricks, with Hampus Lindholm doing so on Dec. 21, 2017 and Lubomir Visnovsky on March 4, 2011.\n\nDubois earned a point for Columbus by scoring with 31.3 seconds remaining in the third period to tie the game at 2, but Fowler said the Ducks did not get down on themselves after conceding late.\n\n\"It sounds silly, but it was pretty positive,\" Fowler said. \"We've been through a lot as a team right now and I think it shows a lot about our group because we didn't panic. We played a great hockey game, it would have been easy to get a little bit down after giving up a late goal like that. But luckily we regrouped and found a way to get a big two points.\"\n\nHenrique and Ducks coach Randy Carlyle each praised Fowler for his leadership and offensive contributions, which took on an added importance after captain Ryan Getzlaf was a late scratch because of an upper-body injury.\n\nFowler scored twice in the second period, tying it at 1 at 9:09 during 4-on-4 play and putting the Ducks ahead 2-1 at 18:26. He has three goals and two assists during a three-game point streak.\n\n\"You can't put a bigger exclamation mark on Cam Fowler than what he was able to accomplish tonight,\" Carlyle said. \"I'm not saying he's going to score three goals in every hockey game, but he drives a lot of puck possession and he's got a lot of responsibility on the power play. On the other side, we ask him to play defense and defense is hard work.\"\n\nGetzlaf is considered day to day, but Carlyle did not know if he would be available to play at Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nThe Blue Jackets ended up earning three of a possible six points during the road trip, which coach John Tortorella considered a positive result for a team he said is lacking in confidence right now.\n\n\"Anything offensively will help us, and that's a big point,\" Tortorella said. \"We leave the California trip .500 with a team that has zero confidence, so we'll take those points and just try to keep on building ourselves up.\"\n\nThe power play has been the most visible representation of Columbus' recent struggles, as the Blue Jackets went 0 for 6 with the man-advantage and are 2 for 38 in their past 10 games. Artemin Panarin appeared to have scored a power-play goal early in the third period, but it came immediately after Alexander Wennberg tripped Ducks defenseman Jacob Larsson.\n\nTortorella thought it was a sign of progress that the Blue Jackets were able to put the puck in the net, even if it was waived off.\n\n\"We had opportunities to score, had a couple of rebound chances that we just missed,\" Tortorella said. \"Yeah, if they score a goal, sure it helps us. But we'll take baby steps right now as far as just having them feel the puck and feel comfortable making plays. It's a crazy dynamic with athletes.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Serge Ibaka outscored the Lakers by himself in the first quarter, and he didn't miss a shot until the third. He beat LA inside and outside on the way to the biggest offensive game of his career.\n\nThanks to Ibaka's brilliance for the Toronto Raptors, Kawhi Leonard wasn't missed by anyone except the Lakers fans who might have been hoping to entice him home.\n\nIbaka made his first 14 shots on the way to a career-high 34 points, and the Raptors didn't need an injured Leonard in a 121-107 victory over Los Angeles on Sunday night.\n\nIbaka had 10 rebounds and didn't miss a shot until 5:16 remained in the third quarter, finishing 15 of 17. He was overpowering while the Raptors jumped to a stunning 31-point lead in the first quarter, and he returned in the final minutes to close out Toronto's eighth consecutive win over the Lakers.\n\n\"I was just focused,\" Ibaka said. \"I knew Kawhi was out tonight, so I just wanted to go out there and do my best.\"\n\nWith the Lakers' small lineups struggling to contain Ibaka early on, he became the first player to start a game 14 of 14 from the field since Shaquille O'Neal did it in February 2006, according to the NBA.\n\n\"That's pretty cool,\" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. \"The best thing is he's doing it with some real good composure. He's getting in there and taking his time. He's using his size, his power, and using pretty good footwork, so it's something we can go to.\"\n\nKyle Lowry added 21 points and 15 assists for the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors, who haven't lost to the Lakers since 2014.\n\n\"We really wanted to put some pressure on them and guard the ball,\" Nurse said. \"We got off to an unbelievable start. We looked athletic and fast all over the place tonight.\"\n\nToronto didn't let its huge lead dwindle significantly until the final minutes, when the Lakers' youngster got the margin down to 117-107 with LeBron James on the bench. Toronto was forced to re-insert its starters in the final minutes to preserve the win.\n\n\"They've been playing like they're the best team in the Eastern Conference so far,\" said James, who finished with 18 points and six assists. \"They just came out and hit us right in the mouth, and it's going to be very hard to make a game of that when you're trying to expend so much energy to get back into it.\"\n\nKyle Kuzma scored 24 points and Brandon Ingram added 16 for the Lakers, who are 4-6 after their first 10 games with James after this defeat on the tail end of a back-to-back set that began with a gritty win in Portland on Saturday night.\n\n\"In my experience, unfortunately, most of the time when a player like Kawhi sits out, that team ends up winning,\" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. \"There's a sense of freedom and joy that comes when a top player like that is out. We tried to explain that that's part of how this works, but it doesn't seem like we took that to heart.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nRaptors: Leonard has sat out three of his first 10 games with Toronto, missing two games last month to manage his workload coming back from last season's injury struggles.

The Lakers would love to sign a second superstar like Leonard, who grew up in the Inland Empire area, one hour east of Los Angeles.\n\nBAD START\n\nThe Lakers' first quarter was shockingly bad.

Trysta Krick recaps a loaded Week 9 that saw New Orleans and New England continue their dominance. USA TODAY\n\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (12) celebrates a touchdown during the first quarter against the Green Bay Packers at Gillette Stadium. (Photo: Stew Milne, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2013 Turns out that the most pivotal pass at Gillette Stadium on Sunday night didn\u2019t come from the arm of Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers.\n\nIt came from Julian Edelman.\n\nThe much-anticipated, rare showdown between the 12s \u2013 Brady and Rodgers \u2013 certainly didn\u2019t lack for drama that matched the hype. But it was Edelman\u2019s 37-yard completion to James White off a double pass with the game tied early in the fourth quarter that sent the Patriots on their way to a 31-17 victory against the Packers.\n\nThe razzle-dazzle connection \u2013 Brady threw a long lateral to Edelman, who found his target streaking down the left sideline on the other side of the field -- gave New England (7-2) a huge jolt of momentum and set up White\u2019s 1-yard scoring plunge two plays later.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see the throw,\u201d said Edelman, flattened by a defender after releasing the pass.\n\nSurely, it had to remind him of his days as a quarterback at Kent State, before he converted to receiver in the NFL.\n\n\u201cIt was a good throw?\u201d he asked.\n\nTold that it was a strike, he added, \u201cJames made a good play.\u201d\n\nBrady later connected with Josh Gordon for a 55-yard touchdown that padded the lead.\n\nIt was New England\u2019s sixth consecutive victory and 10th in a row at home. But even with Brady passing for 294 yards and a TD, it was hardly ordinary as the Patriots sought creative measures \u2013 such as the surprise call for a former college quarterback to heave the football deep - to account for the absence of injured tight end Rob Gronkowski and rookie running back Sony Michel.\n\nEdelman had 136 total yards, including his pass. White had 103 yards from scrimmage. Cordarrelle Patterson led the team in rushing, finishing with 61 yards on the ground and a score.\n\nSimply put, the Patriots find a way.\n\nYet for all of the wrinkles on offense, New England\u2019s defense may have produced its best game of the season when considering the quality of competition. In addition to creating a huge turnover to open the fourth quarter (Lawrence Guy forced the Aaron Jones fumble that Stephon Gilmore recovered), the Patriots held Rodgers to a season-low 259 yards passing while keeping him under constant duress.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats and Information, Rodgers (sacked just once) was pressured or hit (19 times) more than in any game this season.\n\nSo, for all of the anticipation, both of the marquee quarterbacks were upstaged.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Brady, tipping his hat to the Patriots defense. \u201cThe defense played spectacular, and (allowing) 17 points against that offense is great \u2026 It looked like they had to work for every yard, and I know when they\u2019re working for every yard, it\u2019s a good night for our defense.\u201d\n\nRodgers threw for two TDs and, as usual, improvised to make some incredible throws. But he left the place knowing the Packers needed a bit more. For the second consecutive week, Green Bay (3-4-1) came up short on the road against one of the better teams in the NFL. A week earlier, the Packers fell 29-27 against the then-unbeaten Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Rodgers said, recalling the 27-26 lead in the fourth quarter that slipped away at L.A., and the fumble on Sunday night that killed a drive that had already reached field goal range with the game tied.\n\n\u201cI say it all the time, every year you have to learn how to win again and we have to learn now to win on the road.\u201d\n\nThree other things we learned:\n\n1. Cordarrelle Patterson is a great match for Bill Belichick\u2019s resourcefulness\n\nNo Gronkowski. No Michel. And for a brief time, a hobbling White. Yet no crisis. The Patriots merely found something else for their versatile returner-receiver to do.\n\nAfter White went to the sideline with an apparent foot injury late in the second quarter, Patterson lined up in the I-formation and ripped off runs of 10 and 17 yards on back-to-back plays. Then he finished the drive by plowing into the end zone for a 5-yard TD that provided the halftime lead.\n\nPatterson has had spot duty in the backfield throughout the season, but his most extensive work \u2013 and first rushing TD \u2013 came on Sunday night. He\u2019s also scored TDs this season as a receiver (two) and on a kickoff return. Some people wondered whether Patterson, who underwhelmed in Minnesota and Oakland, would flop in Foxborough. It figures that Belichick would find a way to use him.\n\n2. The Packers have another star target on the horizon\n\nRookie Marquez Valdes-Scantling put up his second 100-yard game in three outings with three receptions for 101 yards. A fifth-round pick from South Florida, he was pressed into duty earlier this season due to a rash of injuries in the recieving corps. Yet with his production and big plays, including a 51-yard grab on Sunday night, he is poised to earn even more snaps.\n\n3. Brady tops Peyton\n\nThe Patriots icon didn\u2019t have a classic game, so to speak, but he still managed to leave another marker in the record book. Brady set an NFL record for most total yards, regular season and postseason combined, topping a mark held by Peyton Manning. With a 17-yard completion to Phillip Dorsett in the fourth quarter, Brady raised his total to 79,990 yards.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.", "Hi\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nAlready a print edition subscriber, but don't have a login?", "New England Patriots running back James White, right, celebrates his touchdown run with Joe Thuney, left, during the first half of an NFL football game against the New England Patriots, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Foxborough, Mass.

(AP) \u2014 Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers spent the week telling anyone who asked that the other guy was the better quarterback.\n\nIn the second matchup between the future Hall of Famers, it was the one with five Super Bowl rings who walked off the field with the victory.\n\nBrady threw for 294 yards and a touchdown, and James White ran for two scores to lead the New England Patriots to a 31-17 victory over Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night.\n\nIt was the sixth straight victory for the Patriots (7-2).\n\n\"We made some plays in the fourth quarter when we needed to,\" Brady said. \"Anytime you beat a good football team it feels good. So, 7-2 is a long ways from 1-2 where we were.\"\n\nRodgers completed 24 of 43 passes and two touchdowns but failed to rally his team after tying the game in the third quarter. Rodgers won the first matchup with Brady at Lambeau Field in 2014.\n\n\"If you play long enough, and you have the sustained greatness that Tom has had, there's going to be a lot of records,\" Rodgers said. \"He's been the gold standard at quarterback for two decades.\"\n\nIt was 17-all late in the third quarter when Aaron Jones fumbled for Green Bay (3-4-1).\n\nNew England receiver Julian Edelman hit White on a 37-yard catch-and-run to set up White's second score, a 1-yard run. On the Patriots next possession, Brady connected with Josh Gordon for a 55-yard TD.\n\nGordon caught five passes for 130 yards, the 12th 100-yard receiving game of his career.\n\nWith tight end Rob Gronkowski out with a back and ankle injury and leading rusher Sony Michel out for the second straight week with a knee issue, Brady and the Patriots had to get creative.\n\nThey again turned to receiver Cordarrelle Patterson to help carry the load in the backfield.\n\nPatterson was effective for the second straight week, rushing 11 times for 61 yards and a touchdown .\n\n\"So much of our team is guys being in roles that maybe they didn't sign up for,\" Brady said. \"But they're asked to do it. ... A lot of guys down and you're short at certain spots. Obviously, we have a lot of trust in him that when he's got the ball in his hands good things are going to happen.\"\n\nHe worked in tandem with White to keep the Packers defense guessing. White took advantage and found space to turn short completions into first downs.\n\nNew England also capitalized on a pair of long flea-flicker passes to set up scores.\n\nRodgers was on target in the first half. He was elusive in the pocket and extended plays with his feet, keeping the Patriots' secondary off balance long enough to create space downfield or some big gains.\n\nThe longest was a 51-yard pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in the third quarter that helped set up Rodgers' 15-yard TD pass to Jimmy Graham that tied the game at 17. But the pocket got smaller in the second half as the Patriots defense sped him up, hitting him six times and sacking him once.\n\nBrady completed 16 of his first 22 passes but had six straight incompletions in the third quarter.\n\nThere wasn't a turnover in the game until Green Bay's Jones was stripped by Lawrence Guy early in the fourth quarter. The fumble was recovered by Stephon Gilmore on the Patriots' 24.\n\nNew England quickly capitalized, using four straight completions by Brady and a 37-yard pass from Julian Edelman to get to the Packers' 2. White scored from a yard out two plays later to put the Patriots back in front 24-17.\n\n\"It was obviously a big play in the game,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \"That was a turning point.\"\n\nThe Patriots' defense tightened on Green Bay's next drive. It culminated on third down when Adrian Clayborn and Trey Flowers dropped Rodgers for a 9-yard sack and forcing a punt.\n\nIt proved costly.\n\nOn just the third play of the ensuing drive Brady found Gordon over the middle. Packers cornerback Tramon Williams had a shot at a tackle, but whiffed, springing Gordon for his 55-yard touchdown .\n\nTOSSED\n\nPackers safety Jermaine Whitehead was ejected in the second quarter.\n\nWhitehead was trading shoves with Patriots center David Andrews when second year defensive back from Auburn spun around and slapped Andrews in the face.\n\nHe was called for unnecessary roughness and tossed. Whitehead was the replacement for Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, who was traded to the Washington Redskins last week.\n\nINJURIES\n\nPackers: WR Geronimo Allison was inactive for the Packers with a groin injury.

(AP Photo/Steve Dykes) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Life is good for the Portland Trail Blazers 10 games into the season.\n\nJusuf Nurkic had 19 points and 12 rebounds and led the Trail Blazers to a 111-81 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night.\n\nto improve to 7-3 on the season.\n\n\"When everything go well, it go well,\" Nurkic said after the win pushed the Blazers to 7-3. \"We came ready after back-to-back and a bad loss.\"\n\nBlazers star guard Damian Lillard said the team's start likely has surprised some.\n\n\"To be sitting where we are now, I'm sure people didn't expect it,\" Lillard said. \"I think we're playing good basketball. We've been pretty consistent with the things that we need to do to win games and it's showing.\"\n\nMeyers Leonard had a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. Following a game Saturday in which their bench struggled against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Trail Blazers' reserves bounced back Sunday and outscored the Wolves subs 44-23.\n\n\"I was happy for Meyers,\" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of his reserve big man. \"Got a little chant going, that was fun. I thought in the first half he played very well.\"\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns finished with 23 points for Minnesota. It was his fourth straight game scoring 20 points or more. But scoring was not the issue for the Wolves on Sunday, as the Blazers got plenty of points at the free-throw line.\n\n\"Defensively, the penetration really hurt us,\" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said.\n\nPortland, the league's best free-throw shooting team, took advantage of its free-throw attempts in the first two quarters for a 61-45 halftime lead. In the game, the Trail Blazers shot 28 for 32 from the line.\n\nThe Blazers continued the onslaught in the third quarter, pushing their lead to as many as 28 points.\n\nFor the second straight game, the Blazers struggled from beyond the arc (7 for 28), but it didn't matter against the Wolves.\n\nThe timeout helped as Minnesota stormed back, even taking a brief two-point lead on a 3-pointer from rookie guard Josh Okogie.\n\nPortland, however, took control of the game on the strength of their subs.\n\nTowns already had his knees wrapped up before the 4th quarter even started, knowing his night was over.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTrail Blazers: In each of last three seasons, Portland's CJ McCollum has averaged over 20 points per game. But despite a league-wide scoring boom, McCollum has actually seen his scoring average drop to 19 points. While McCollum is sacrificing some individual glory, the Blazers have a 7-3 record and entered Sunday with the third-ranked offense in the NBA.\n\n\"I think obviously having Evan (Turner) out there with them, playing more minutes with Damian (Lillard) affects how much the ball is in his hands. His numbers are probably down a little bit but not significantly,\" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of the adjustment for McCollum. \"The emphasis this year was, again, passing and incorporating the team more and less off the dribble. That's how we are playing right now. I think everybody was on the same page. Not just talking to him but to everybody.\"\n\nTimberwolves: Disgruntled Wolves forward Jimmy Butler sat out of Sunday night's game in Portland, due to what the team deemed \"precautionary rest.\"\n\nButler did not play in the Wolves game Wednesday, but did play Friday at Golden State\n\nThibodeau did confirm to reporters before the game that Butler was with the team, clearly trying to downplay Butler's absence in light of the star forward's trade request.\n\nThe Wolves were also without point guard Derrick Rose on Sunday, who was a late-scratch after being deemed a game-time decision by his coach.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTrail Blazers: Home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday.\n\nTimberwolves: On the road against the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Gene Page, AMC)\n\nSpoiler alert: This story contains significant details from Sunday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d was touted by AMC as \u201cRick Grimes\u2019 Last Episode.\u201d By the end, however, the zombie action-thriller\u2019s leading man appears to be 180 degrees from the show\u2019s title: He isn\u2019t walking, but he isn\u2019t dead, either.\n\nWhat that means for Rick, since this is the last series episode for the character and the actor who plays him, Andrew Lincoln, is anybody\u2019s guess. But a series of three TV movies will continue his story, AMC announced Sunday.\n\nAt the end of last week's episode, viewers saw Rick impaled on rebar jutting from a concrete slab after his spooked horse threw him as a swarm of walkers approached. But there was no way Rick was going to end up as zombie chow, which would have been an ignominious demise for the walker-slaying hero.\n\nAs Sunday\u2019s episode opens, Rick is back in the hospital room where the series began. It's clear he's in a hallucinatory state as he\u2019s talking to his bedridden earlier self, who had awakened from a coma to find the zombie apocalypse had started.\n\nRick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is in bit of a pinch after being impaled on rebar after his horse threw him on AMC's 'The Walking Dead.' (Photo: Jackson Lee Davis, AMC)\n\nBack in the real world, the resourceful lawman pulls a MacGyver, throwing his belt over another piece of rebar and pulling himself up from where he had been pinned. He escapes on the suddenly calm horse and, in true selfless form, attempts to lead the walker horde away from his comrades\u2019 camps even while bleeding profusely.\n\nAt the same time, junkyard Jadis (Pollyanna MacIntosh) \u2013 who has abandoned her alter ego Anne \u2013 is trying to escape from Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam), Rick and the other survivors after her secret partnership with a mysterious group that owns a helicopter is found out.\n\nShe has made a deal for exfiltration; she has to deliver a survivor, although she can\u2019t bring herself to take Gabriel, with whom she has developed an emotional and romantic bond. The Jadis back story will play a significant role later in the episode. (There\u2019s also an important Negan story pitting Michonne against Maggie, but Rick\u2019s fate is the main event.)\n\nThe action shifts back to the main stage as fading Rick, his blood staining his horse\u2019s white coat, starts to hallucinate again, taking longtime fans back to memorable moments and characters. In a fitting flashback, viewers see Rick in a famous shot from the first season in which he\u2019s riding a horse on a highway outside Atlanta, with thousands of walkers in the picture.\n\nWith zombie walkers in pursuit, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) mounts a horse after extricating himself from a rebar puncture on AMC's 'The Walking Dead.' (Photo: Jackson Lee Davis, AMC)\n\nRick comes to again \u2013 he jumps back and forth between consciousness and unconsciousness \u2013 just in time to escape the ghoulish masses, taking refuge in an abandoned house where he fashions cloth into a bandage for his side. He drifts off. During his hallucination, he runs into a familiar face, former sheriff partner Shane (Jon Bernthal), who became a rival killed by Rick way back in Season 2.\n\nWhen Rick says he\u2019s searching for his family, Shane says it could be his, since Rick has long believed that his daughter, Judith, is really Shane\u2019s child from a relationship started with Rick's wife, Lori, when they thought he was dead.\n\nSuddenly, Rick revives from his trance as a walker is about to bite him. He escapes from the house. The horse, of course, is standing right there. As Rick is riding, he passes out again and finds himself on a beautiful farm with the long-dead Hershel, Maggie\u2019s father and a wise mentor for Rick. As Rick explains he needs to find his family, Hershel (Scott Wilson, who died in early October) sagely advises that he doesn\u2019t before warning him to wake up \u2013 because the zombies are approaching!\n\nIn his next hallucination, Rick is back in the first hospital, walking through the doors that were barred to hold back walkers. He enters an area strewn with bodies, including ones that look from behind like his son, Carl, and Hershel's daughter, Beth, who both died earlier in the series. Suddenly, another deceased survivor, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green, perhaps beaming down from \u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d) rises and tells an upset Rick that all is OK despite the bodies.\n\nAnne (Pollyanna McIntosh), or is it Jadis again, becomes intertwined in Rick Grimes' saga as he attempts to escape the survivors on AMC's 'The Walking Dead.' (Photo: Jackson Lee Davis, AMC)\n\n\u201cYou did your part, like I did mine. They gave us the strength that we needed to do what we had to do for the others. The others draw strength from us. We change each other, we help each other, we make each other better, and it never ends,\u201d she says.\n\nSasha then tells hallucinating Rick to wake up, just as he\u2019s falling from his horse in reality. He fights off a few walkers, then heads toward the bridge that he had been so focused on repairing during early episodes this season.\n\nWhen he gets to the bridge, he imagines his allies \u2013 Daryl, Carol, Eugene and his beloved partner, Michonne \u2013 coming to his rescue, but they\u2019re not really there. He revives again, but the hope that the bridge might collapse under the horde\u2019s weight doesn\u2019t materialize.\n\nThe zombies approach, as do Daryl and the others \u2013 this time for real \u2013 but they can\u2019t save Rick. A walker knocks over some dynamite on the bridge, and Rick chooses his final option. He shoots the explosives, blowing up many zombies \u2013 and apparently himself \u2013 as other walkers fall into the river.\n\nToddler Judith (Chloe Garcia-Frizzi) undergoes quite the transformation by the end of Sunday's episode of AMC's 'The Walking Dead.' (Photo: Jackson Lee Davis, AMC)\n\nMichonne silently screams as Maggie and Carol try to console her. A despondent Daryl walks away.\n\nThe scene cuts to Jadis, still awaiting her own evacuation, as she watches dead zombies float downstream before seeing Rick, barely alive, on the shore. The helicopter, seen in an earlier episode, flies them both away. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be OK,\u201d Jadis tells Rick, who lies on a stretcher. \u201cI\u2019m going to save you.\u201d\n\nThe action cuts to a new scene where strangers are struggling to stave off another group of walkers, who are enjoying their greatest amount of screen time in ages this season. An unseen sniper shoots some walkers, allowing the people to get away.\n\nThe shooter is Rick\u2019s daughter, Judith, but she\u2019s no longer a toddler. She\u2019s at least a few years older, a young authority figure wearing her dad\u2019s hat, her brother's favorite accessory, and armed with a gun, a reminder of her father, and a katana sword, the symbol of Michonne, who has become her stepmother.\n\nIt\u2019s the future. And Rick is no longer there. But the first of the new films will \"explore the story of where Rick is taken and what he faces in a new corner of the zombie apocalypse.\"\n\nIn a statement accompanying the announcement of the films, the first of which begins production next year, Lincoln said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the beginning of the end, it\u2019s the end of the beginning. And I like the idea that we get to tell a bigger story, maybe with a sort of wider vista. \u2026 Maybe it\u2019s the start of a bigger story.\u201d\n\nAMC also says \"The Walking Dead\" universe will expand further with other specials, series, films and digital content.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/05/andrew-lincoln-rick-grimes-make-final-stand-amc-walking-dead/1853110002/", "SCOREBOARD\n\nMonday, Nov. 5.\n\nTennessee at Dallas, 8:15 p.m. Amari Cooper makes his debut for the Cowboys (3-4) after being acquired by Oakland on Tuesday, giving Dak Prescott a new No. 1 wide receiver and potentially giving a boost to a passing game that ranks a lowly 29th in the NFL.

It's not unusual for players to share secrets about their former team after being released or waived, but it is difficult to recall anyone talking about it publicly. \"When I came in I had the playbook and said, 'It will be on my desk and what you do with it is on you,'\" Smith recalled. Smith said the playbook was missing from his locker for a couple of days before it was returned and he took it home. Smith said he had a copy of the Panthers' playbook because it was given to him by another player who was cut a couple years before he was released by the team. Smith said he thought the playbook might be helpful if he got into coaching after his playing career.\n\n___\n\nFITTING TRIBUTE\n\nPittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger wore cleats emblazoned with a Star of David in response to the late-October shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.

During the heyday of the Purple People Eaters, the Vikings had nine sacks in a game in 1968, 1969 and 1970. They also did it in 1993. But this was the record-setter, thanks to a well-timed mix of blitzes called by coach Mike Zimmer and the relentless rush by Danielle Hunter, who had 3\u00bd, and his friends up front.\n\n___\n\nSWING AND A MISS\n\nLos Angeles Chargers kicker Caleb Sturgis missed two extra points and a 42-yard field goal attempt in a 25-17 win at Seattle. Sturgis is the first kicker with a missed extra point and missed field goal in three straight games since Raiders kicker Jim Breech in 1979.\n\n___\n\nHAPPY HOMECOMING\n\nBrandon McManus missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired, leaving Demaryius Thomas a winner in his homecoming as the Houston Texans escaped Denver with a 19-17 win over the Broncos. Thomas finished with three receptions for 61 yards, but two of them were back-to-back for 31 and 18 yards on the Texans' opening touchdown drive. Thomas had started all 114 games for the Broncos since Jan. 8, 2012, when he caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Tim Tebow on the first snap of overtime to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 29-23. This time, he drew loud ovations when he emerged from the tunnel for pregame stretch and again during a video tribute after \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Outside the stadium, the Broncos put up a giant \"Thank you, D.T.\" banner at the bottom of a 10-story-high image of Thomas next to one of Von Miller.\n\n___\n\nHELLO?\n\nMichael Thomas caught a late 72-yard touchdown reception and then celebrated with a cellphone in a throwback to another famous New Orleans play, and the streaking Saints handed the Los Angeles Rams their first loss of the season with a 45-35 win. Thomas' long TD came on a pivotal third-down play with about four minutes to go, when the Rams seemed to expect the Saints to run a play closer to the first-down marker. Thomas ran free behind Marcus Peters, caught Brees' long throw virtually in stride and ran straight to the goal post, where he got out an old-school flip phone \u2014 reminiscent of Joe Horn's Sunday night TD celebration in 2003. Like Horn, Thomas was penalized, but the Rams never threatened after that.\n\n___\n\nSIDELINED\n\nCleveland defensive backs Denzel Ward and E.J. Gaines left with injuries in the first quarter of a loss to Kansas City. Ward was sidelined by a hip injury, and Gaines sustained a concussion. Linebacker Christian Kirksey also departed with a hamstring injury, and the short-handed Browns allowed 499 yards in a 37-21 loss to Patrick Mahomes and the high-scoring Chiefs. ... Already without left tackle Trent Williams after right thumb surgery, Washington lost left guard Shaun Lauvao to a left knee injury and right guard Brandon Scherff to a left shoulder injury. Lauvao got hurt on the third play of the game and was taken off the sideline in a wheelchair. ...

(AP Photo/Scott Eklund) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Russell Wilson missed a wide-open Jaron Brown for a potential touchdown. He reverted to a problem from earlier this season taking too many sacks. Most costly, he misread coverage and threw a pass that was intercepted and returned for a touchdown midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nYet for all those issues, Wilson was a slightly deflected pass away from leading a remarkable comeback and getting the Seattle Seahawks into overtime against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.\n\nEncapsulating Wilson's performance in Seattle's 25-17 loss to the Chargers is not simple. At times, he showed the same brilliance as a week ago against Detroit when he posted the first perfect passer rating in team history. In other moments, Wilson looked uncertain \u2014 especially with Seattle's run game working only in spurts because of a hip injury to starter Chris Carson.\n\nHe'll be lauded for giving Seattle a chance to force overtime on the final, untimed play of regulation following a pass interference penalty against Tyler Lockett in the end zone. But he'll also lament Chargers safety Jahleel Addae getting the tip of his finger on the throw and deflecting it just enough that David Moore couldn't make a clean catch.\n\n\"I knew it was a tight window and we tried to get it in there,\" Wilson said. I think it maybe got tipped a hair. It was tough. David has done a great job all year making those plays.\"\n\nWilson's day mirrored Seattle's as a whole. Their offense was great on the opening possession, only to face problems with penalties and sacks that put them in difficult down-and-distance situations and caused the offense to stagnate. Defensively, the Seahawks allowed the Chargers to average 10 yards per play in the first half, and rush for 7.3 yards per carry for the game. Melvin Gordon ran for 113 yards on just 16 carries, averaging 7.1 yards per rush.\n\nBig plays were a problem, too. Seattle allowed a 34-yard touchdown run by Gordon, a 28-yard run by Keenan Allen, a 54-yard pass to Allen and a 30-yard TD toss to Mike Williams.\n\n\"I feel like we got in our own way a lot,\" Seattle defensive end Frank Clark said. \"When you look at the past few weeks, you watch how much we've improved from where we started. It's obvious. The stats don't lie. The rankings don't lie where we placed. But at the end of the day, we didn't come to show that today. We didn't show up and show out at the end of the day and that's what you've got to do in this league.\"\n\nDespite those issues on the defensive side, it comes back to the play of the quarterback as usual. Seattle's intended style worked to perfection on the opening drive when Wilson used up more than half of the first quarter and capped the 13-play drive with a 10-yard TD pass to Brown.\n\nFrom there is where Wilson and the Seahawks struggled. Of Seattle's next nine possessions, none gained more than 49 net yards and only one \u2014 finishing off the first half \u2014 ended in points when Sebastian Janikowski hit a 44-yard field goal. Wilson was sacked three times and while he was 15 of 20 passing for 148 yards during that stretch, many of those completions came with Seattle facing long down-and-distance situations. Seattle had just 53 yards rushing in the second and third quarters combined after running for 45 yards on the opening drive of the game.\n\n\"We got behind the sticks today and it hasn't happened for about a month now. ... It changes everything. That's not the way we've been playing,\" Seattle coach Pete Carroll said.\n\nDespite all that, Wilson nearly pulled off another fourth-quarter rally. Wilson hit Nick Vannett on a 6-yard TD with 1:50 remaining to cut the Chargers' lead to one score. Seattle got the ball back with 1:24 left at its own 22 and after two completions and a roughing the passer penalty on Melvin Ingram, the Seahawks were at the Chargers 44 with 50 seconds left.

(AP Photo/Noah K. Murray) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Henrik Lundqvist was in vintage form in helping the New York Rangers get a big win.\n\nLundqvist stopped 39 shots and Jimmy Vesey scored twice to lead New York to its third straight victory, 3-1 over the Buffalo Sabres on Sunday night.\n\n\"Hank was outstanding tonight,\" Rangers coach David Quinn said. \"We managed a way to get it done. I thought the third period we did a pretty good job of managing the puck and getting it behind them.\"\n\nNeal Pionk also scored for New York, and rookie Brett Howden picked up his sixth assist of the season before leaving with an injury in the second period.\n\n\"I think we earned this type of game,\" Lundqvist said. \"Then in the third, I think we played our best period. Tonight, we made some really strong plays at the right time.\"\n\nLundqvist was stellar while picking up his fourth win of the season and 435th of his career, moving just two behind Jacaues Plante for seventh place on the NHL's all-time list.\n\nConor Sheary scored for Buffalo and Carter Hutton made 19 saves.\n\nThe Rangers made the most of their first two shots in the middle period, scoring twice within 19 seconds.\n\n\"We capitalized on a few chances we had and that was the difference in the game,\" Vesey said.\n\nPionk scored 41 seconds into the period when his wrist shot sailed past Hutton. Vladislav Namestnikov and Mika Zibanejad assisted on the play. On the Rangers' next shot, Vesey snapped off a wrist shot from the slot to make it 2-0. Howden made a nifty drop pass to set up his linemate.\n\nHowden crashed hard into the boards later in the second before being helped off the ice with about 6 1/2 minutes remaining. He did not return.\n\nLundqvist appeared to be injured late in the second when Rasmus Dahlin, the first overall pick in June's NHL draft, collided with his Swedish countrymate. However, after an extended look from the trainer, Lundqvist remained in the game.\n\nSheary took advantage of a turnover by Brendan Smith to pull the Sabres within one as he scored off his own rebound at 6:07 of the third.\n\n\"I really liked the way we played from start to finish,\" Sabres coach Phil Housley said. \"We would like to take two or three shifts back in the second period. ... It's just important in those situations when it's a tight hockey game you can't take a shift off. You can't let your guard down and they capitalized on some soft coverage. It's a good lesson to be learned.\"\n\nThe Rangers had allowed a tying or go-ahead goal in the final minute of their previous three games on the west coast trip but managed to win the last two with the help of a shootout. Sunday, Vesey tallied an empty-netter to seal the deal.\n\nBuffalo finished 0 for 4 on the power play, and New York was 0 for 1.\n\nThe Sabres' top line of Jeff Skinner, Jack Eichel and Jason Pominville has been one of the best trio's in the NHL since being put together. After combining for 38 points in the previous seven games, they were held scoreless by the Rangers.\n\nNOTES: F Pavel Buchnevich returned to the Rangers' lineup after being a healthy scratch for the second time this season. ...

(Photo: Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 Tony Stewart has spent two decades in NASCAR and still doesn\u2019t grasp some of the series\u2019 rules, a topic that became an issue when seven-time series champion Jimmie Johnson was mistakenly penalized moments before Sunday\u2019s AAA Texas 500.\n\n\u201cYou have to make it simpler,\u201d said Stewart after one of his drivers, Kevin Harvick, won the race to clinch a spot in the Championship 4. \u201cHalf the time, you don\u2019t know what the penalties are supposed to be and I\u2019m a car owner.

There were only two. In that case, the 48 should not have started in the back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. It\u2019s not something you can fix during the race, unfortunately.

(Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nFor the first eight weeks of the NFL season, there were two certainties among the pass-catching ranks: Adam Thielen would have 100 receiving yards and Julio Jones would not get in the end zone.\n\nBoth streaks were broken on Sunday as the Atlanta Falcons star caught seven passes for 121 and his first TD of the season.\n\nDespite his lack of scoring, Jones was the No. 14 fantasy wide receiver on the season with 53 catches for 812 yards. He trailed only Devone Bess of the 2009 Miami Dolphins for the most yards in a season before scoring a TD.\n\nBut with 3:45 to play in the game, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan hit Jones for a 35-yard score.\n\nIT HAPPENED. Julio Jones finally scored a touchdown, and his Falcons teammates were pumped. https://t.co/ABX3LyRprCpic.twitter.com/YFLtFi1MXv \u2014 For The Win (@ForTheWin) November 4, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, the Minnesota Vikings didn't have starting wideout Stefon Diggs for their game against the Detroit Lions. That should have made Thielen \u2014 fantasy's No. 1 wide receiver by a mile -- an even better play.\n\nInstead, the game turned into a defensive struggle and Thielen was held to four catches for 22 yards. But he did get into the end zone to salvage his fantasy day.\n\nLiving up to the hype\n\nFantasy owners anxiously awaited what figured to be a high-scoring affair between the New Orleans Saints and Los Angeles Rams. In some places, the projected over/under in points scored was 60 \u2014 the first game of the season to go that high.\n\nThe players did not disappoint.\n\nThe Saints produced the week's two highest overall scorers as wide receiver Michael Thomas caught 12 passes for 211 yards, including a game-breaking 72-yard touchdown (with a special cell-e-bration at the end).\n\nWhat\u2019s better, the play by Michael Thomas or his Joe Horn-inspired celly? pic.twitter.com/lp3fWSYa67 \u2014 USA TODAY Sports (@usatodaysports) November 5, 2018\n\nRunning back Alvin Kamara had 82 yards and a touchdown on the ground to go with four receptions for 34 yards and another score. Benjamin Watson and TreQuan Smith also added TD catches.\n\nOn the Rams side, Todd Gurley didn't hit 20 fantasy points for the first time all season, finishing with 19.9 on 79 total yards, six receptions and a touchdown. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp finished with the exact same fantasy point total (five catches, 89 yards, TD), while wideout Brandin Cooks led L.A.'s skill players with six grabs, 114 yards and a touchdown for 23.4 FP.\n\nAnd of course, quarterbacks Drew Brees and Jared Goff finished 1-2 at the position in fantasy points for the week.\n\nBroad Shoulders Award\n\nHowever ... our weekly honor for the player who single-handedly carried his fantasy owners to victory goes to Atlanta Falcons running back Tevin Coleman.\n\nDespite Jones' heroics, Coleman carried the load for Atlanta. He ran the ball 13 times for 88 yards and caught five passes for 68 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nFour other players tallied more than Coleman's 32.6 fantasy points (PPR scoring) but those were every-week starters: Thomas, Kamara, Kareem Hunt and Christian McCaffrey.\n\nColeman was likely a RB2 or a flex starter -\u2014 and getting that kind of production out of a secondary lineup spot made a huge impact for fantasy owners with Coleman in their lineups (and those who left him on their benches).\n\nDefenses make a difference\n\nDefenses rarely get much attention in fantasy football. Only two teams entered the week averaging more than 8.5 fantasy points per game on defense.\n\nHowever, several defenses came up big in Week 9. The Chicago Bears (29 FP) led the way with a pair of touchdowns against the Buffalo Bills and quarterback Nathan Peterman (although neither score was Peterman's fault).\n\nThe Miami Dolphins also returned an interception for a touchdown, one of four picks on the day, on their way to 24 fantasy points.\n\nAnd the Minnesota Vikings' Danielle Hunter was an IDP monster with 3.5 sacks and a fumble return for a touchdown against the Detroit Lions. The Vikes set a team record with 10 sacks.\n\nEarly waiver wire\n\nLooking ahead to Week 10, four more teams will be on a bye. So fantasy owners will need to continue to be vigilant in finding plug-and-play starters.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Adam Humphries made a strong case for himself by catching all eight of his targets for 82 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran the ball once for 7 more yards. While the Bucs' star wideout, Mike Evans, caught just one of 10 targets, Humphries finished with the second-highest fantasy point total among wide receivers.\n\nIn the same game, Carolina Panthers wideout Curtis Samuel also showed off his rushing and receiving skills. He had a magnificent 33-yard touchdown on a reverse and also caught two passes for 25 yards and a score.\n\nCurtis Samuel covered a total of 103.8 yards on his 33-yard double-reverse TD run against the Buccaneers in the 2nd quarter.\n\n\n\nThis is the longest distance covered as a ball carrier on a rushing play this season. #TBvsCAR#KeepPoundingpic.twitter.com/R3Cen6ACep \u2014 Next Gen Stats (@NextGenStats) November 4, 2018\n\nThe Washington Redskins didn't have perhaps their best wide receiver, Jamison Crowder, so Maurice Harris raised his game. The third-year pro caught a career-high 10 passes for 124 yards \u2014 and he gets to play the Buccaneers next week.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks' top running back, Chris Carson, exited early with an injury \u2014 which left Mike Davis with the majority of the workload. He totaled 107 yards from scrimmage and caught seven passes. Davis could have a similar role next week if Carson's injury lingers.\n\nAnd Broncos tight end Jeff Heuerman was targeted 11 times (he caught 10) for 83 yards and a touchdown.

Not at the current moment, anyway.\n\nMcManus sailed a 51-yard field goal try wide in the final seconds as the Broncos lost 19-17 to the Houston Texans on Sunday. Denver fell to 3-6 with barely flickering playoff hopes and a coach on the hot seat heading into a bye week.\n\n\"We just have to stick together,\" safety Justin Simmons said. \"It's harder in terms of guys want to start pointing the fingers and there's always blame going around.

They went 5-11 a season ago that included a string of eight straight losses.\n\n\"I don't have a problem with how we're coaching and how we're playing,\" Joseph said after losing for the sixth time in seven games. \"We've just got to finish games better.\"\n\nThe play-calling in the final minute could lead to some second-guessing. The Broncos had the ball at the Texans 37 with about 43 seconds remaining. Case Keenum completed a 5-yard pass to tight end Jeff Heuerman and instead of sprinting up to the line, the Broncos took their time, before running back Phillip Lindsay lost a yard on a run up the middle.\n\nSo instead of getting it closer, they settled for a 51-yard try with 3 seconds remaining. It sailed right as McManus hung his head in frustration after his second miss of the game. He also had a 62-yard attempt sail wide right in the first half \u2014 giving the Texans time to move into field-goal range.\n\n\"There's no pointing fingers. B-Mac is a great kicker,\" said rookie receiver Courtland Sutton, who wore a No. 88 Demaryius Thomas jersey after the game in a tribute to a teammate that was traded to the Texans on Tuesday. \"We all know that. ...

But there were quite a few miscues: Sutton had a TD slip through his hands, Devontae Booker fumbled and the defensive backs had a costly miscommunication when DeAndre Hopkins hauled in a 16-yard pass from Deshaun Watson in the second quarter.\n\n\"Snake bitten? No. Unlucky? No,\" Sutton said. \"We just have to make sure we're putting ourselves in a situation where we're not trailing at the end of the game like that.\"\n\nThe Broncos have lost six games by an average of 7.8 points.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. \"You lose and you know you're capable of beating this team. We had them. I pride myself on being able to make game-changing plays and be able to change the game.\"\n\nOn the touchdown play to Hopkins, the Broncos had double coverage only for him to sneak in between Simmons and Adam Jones.\n\n\"The error is so small for our team. We can't mess up like we did today and have a chance to win,\" Harris said. \"We've got to damn near play perfect.

Now, it's very hard. It's very hard to come back out of this.\"\n\nStill, his message for his teammates over the break is simple: Clear the mind.\n\n\"Get ready to finish the year strong,\" Harris said. \"I've got my mind right to finish strong.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Bill Feig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 When the time came to dial up a big play for Michael Thomas, the Saints' leading receiver answered the call.\n\nHe even had a flip phone planted in the padding of each goal post, just in case.\n\nThomas caught a late 72-yard touchdown reception and then celebrated with a cellphone in a throwback to another famous New Orleans play, and the streaking Saints handed the Los Angeles Rams their first loss of the season with a 45-35 victory on Sunday.\n\n\"I loved the celebration myself, and I think it was the perfect time when I did it,\" Thomas said. \"We love our fans and we always want to bring them back great memories.\"\n\nDrew Brees passed for 346 yards and four touchdowns in New Orleans' seventh straight win, and Thomas finished with a club-record 211 yards receiving. But what happened after the last of his 12 receptions stole the show in a wild shootout between two of the NFL's best offenses.\n\nThomas' long TD came on a pivotal third-down play with about four minutes left. The Rams (8-1) seemed to expect the Saints (7-1) to run a play closer to the first-down marker and double-teamed dynamic running back Alvin Kamara.\n\nBrees recalled thinking, \"Kamara's doubled, Mike's singled, Mike's by him, here we go.\"\n\nThomas ran free behind Marcus Peters, caught Brees' long throw virtually in stride and ran straight to the goal post to begin his reprise of Joe Horn's Sunday night TD celebration against the New York Giants in 2003.\n\n\"I paid a tribute to him, tried to get the crowd going a little bit more, set the tone, have fun out there, giving people a show,\" said Thomas, who eclipsed Wes Chandler's club record of 205 yards receiving against Atlanta in 1979. \"You got to have fun. All these guys just catching touchdowns and celebrating with each other, having fun, getting the crowd involved. I felt like I had an opportunity to make it happen.\"\n\nLike Horn, Thomas was penalized, but the Rams never threatened again.\n\nP.J. Williams, who forced a fumble and had an interception for a touchdown in New Orleans' previous victory at Minnesota, broke up a fourth-down pass intended for Brandin Cooks, virtually sealing the result. The former Saints receiver, who caught six passes for 114 yards and a TD, fell to his knees in frustration.\n\nKamara scored three times, twice on runs and once on a 16-yard catch-and-run \u2014 all in the first half.\n\nRams defensive players lambasted themselves for poor tackling at inopportune times, particularly on Kamara, who gained 116 yards from scrimmage. But coach Sean McVay sought to put the season's lone loss in a positive light.\n\n\"We're good. We love it. You find out about yourself when you have a little bit of adversity,\" McVay said. \"I know that everybody in that locker room is going to respond the right way. Sometimes setbacks can be setups for comebacks \u2014 and that's the way we look at it.\"\n\nCOMEBACK BID\n\nJared Goff, who passed for 391 yards and three TDs, nearly led the Rams to an extraordinary comeback amid the din of the Superdome.\n\nLos Angeles rallied to tie it at 35 with 21 unanswered points in less than 21 minutes, starting with Greg Zuerlein's 56-yard field goal as time expired in the first half.\n\nThe Rams opened the second half with an 11-play touchdown drive capped by Malcolm Brown's 18-yard catch in which he hopped over safety Marcus Williams along the sideline and kept his balance long enough to reach the ball across the goal line.\n\nAfter another Los Angeles field goal, the Rams forced a second straight punt and tied it on Cooper Kupp's 41-yard catch-and-run along the sideline.\n\nThe Saints regained the lead on Wil Lutz's 54-yard field goal, and then forced the Rams' first punt of the game with about five minutes left.\n\nSCORCHING START\n\nBoth teams scored touchdowns on each of their first two possessions, starting with Kamara's 11-yard run and Todd Gurley's 8-yard score.\n\nGurley's score have him a TD in a Rams-record 12 straight games, passing Hall of Famer Elroy Hirsch.\n\nThe tenor changed when outside linebacker Samson Ebukam stripped Saints running back Mark Ingram and defensive Aaron Donald recovered on the Saints 22. But four plays later, Johnny Hekker was ruled down just short of a first down on a fake field goal.\n\n\"We're an aggressive, attacking-type team, and if we feel like some of these looks present themselves to try to do that, we have confidence in our players,\" McVay said. \"Unfortunately, it didn't work out.\"\n\nThe Saints responded with Brees' quick hit over the middle to rookie Tre'Quan Smith from 4 yards out for the first of three successive New Orleans touchdowns.\n\nAfter Zuerlein missed a 51-yard field goal attempt, the Saints scored on Brees' 13-yard pass to Ben Watson with just more than a minute left in the half.\n\nAlex Anzelone's diving interception of Goff's pass over the middle set up Kamara's short TD run with 26 seconds left in the half.\n\n\"We as a defense didn't play well enough,\" Rams defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh said. \"The first half, we gave up way too many points and put ourselves in a bad position.\"\n\nINJURIES\n\nRams edge pass rusher Matt Longacre was being evaluated for a concussion during the second quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRams: Host Seattle on Sunday.\n\nSaints: Visit Cincinnati on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He didn't see David Moore running open behind him in the back of the end zone, and as the pass floated past, Addae reached out his right arm as far as he could.\n\n\"I got my last fingernail on it,\" Addae said. \"I barely snipped it.\"\n\nAnother last-second challenge for the Los Angeles Chargers defense. Another victory for the surging Chargers, holding off Wilson's late rally for a 25-17 win over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.\n\nThe Chargers won their fifth straight, putting a capper on Philip Rivers' 200th consecutive start with another clutch defensive stand. Rivers threw two touchdowns, Melvin Gordon ran for 113 yards, yet those two were standing on the sideline watching after a pass interference call against Michael Davis on the final play of regulation gave Seattle an untimed down and a chance to force overtime.\n\nAnd just like they did in London when the Chargers denied Tennessee's 2-point conversion attempt to preserve a 20-19 win, the defense came through again.\n\n\"It shouldn't have come down to that but it did,\" Rivers said. \"We found a way to win. These kinds of wins are huge.\"\n\nRivers threw touchdown passes of 12 yards to Tyrell Williams and 30 yards to Mike Williams, and let the Chargers defense stymie Wilson until the final minutes. Seattle had won four of five following a 0-2 start.\n\nDesmond King provided the deciding points for Los Angeles (6-2) by stepping in front of Wilson's pass for Moore and returning it 42 yards for a touchdown with 6:44 remaining to give the Chargers a 25-10 lead.\n\nWilson managed to make the final minutes nervous for Los Angeles.\n\n\"We had a chance to win a game that's right there for us,\" Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \"It was going to be dramatic, but we're OK about that.\"\n\nWilson hit Nick Vannett on a 6-yard TD with 1:50 remaining to cut the Chargers' lead to one score. Seattle got the ball back with 1:24 left at its own 22 and after two completions and a roughing the passer penalty on Melvin Ingram, the Seahawks were at the Chargers 44 with 50 seconds left. Wilson scrambled for 16 yards to the Chargers 28 and, after a spike, Seattle had 30 seconds left.\n\nSeattle (4-4) got a break when Davis was called for pass interference in the end zone on the final play of regulation against Tyler Lockett, putting the ball at the 1 for an untimed down. Seattle's J.R. Sweezy was called for false start backing the play up to the 6, and Wilson's final attempt for Moore in the back of the end zone was partially tipped by Addae and fell incomplete.\n\n\"It's like winning a playoff game,\" Chargers defensive lineman Brandon Mebane said. \"That was like a playoff game.\"\n\nWilson was 26 of 39 for 235 yards, and threw a 10-yard TD pass to Jaron Brown on Seattle's opening drive.\n\nRivers became the fourth quarterback in league history to start 200 straight games, joining Brett Favre, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning. Favre started an NFL-record 297 straight times in the regular season. This wasn't like his 2010 performance in Seattle when Rivers threw for 455 yards, but he made key throws at important times, especially in the first half. The Chargers averaged 10 yards per play in the first half and scored touchdowns on three of their five possessions, the last one taking just 55 seconds to find the end zone on a 30-yard catch-and-run by Mike Williams.\n\nGordon averaged 7.1 yards per carry and ran through huge holes in the second half. His 34-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter gave him 34 TDs in his past 36 games after going scoreless in his first 14 games.\n\nSeattle also didn't have answers for Keenan Allen, who had 124 yards on six receptions.\n\n\"It's great, any time we can go on the road, loudest place in the league and get a win the way we did,\" Allen said. \"I thought it was dominating, outside the points we missed, but pretty great.\"\n\nUNBEATEN NO MORE: Saints bring Rams' perfect run to an end in wild shootout\n\nPANIC BUTTON?

(AP) \u2014 Ryan Fitzpatrick played well enough to retain starting the quarterback job in Tampa Bay for another week.\n\nNow if \"Fitzmagic\" can figure out how to keep the Buccaneers from digging themselves such a big hole early in games.\n\nFitzpatrick replaced the struggling Jameis Winston and threw for 243 yards and four touchdowns, but it wasn't nearly enough for the Buccaneers to overcome a 28-point first half deficit as they lost 42-28 to the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. Fitzpatrick threw two interceptions, including one in the first quarter to Eric Reid that led to Carolina's first touchdown.\n\n\"Ryan did some good things today,\" said coach Dirk Koetter, who confirmed Fitzpatrick will start against the Redskins on Sunday. \"We've got to play better across the board.\"\n\nThat includes on defense, where the Bucs have gone five games this season without forcing a turnover. They haven't had an interception since Week 3.\n\n\"If you're not getting any help, you better not be turning it over on offense,\" Koetter said.\n\nFitzpatrick didn't get much help from his top receivers Mike Evans and DeSean Jackson, who were essentially non-factors.\n\nEvans was blanketed all day by cornerback James Bradberry and managed just one 16-yard reception on 10 targets. Jackson saw limited playing time and caught just two passes for 32 yards against rookie Donte Jackson, who intercepted Fitzpatrick on a downfield heave late in the fourth quarter to seal Carolina's third straight win.\n\nIt was slot receiver Adam Humphries and tight end O.J. Howard who did most of the damage. Humphries had eight catches for 82 yards and two touchdowns, while Howard hauled in four catches for 53 yards and two more scores.\n\nDespite the loss, Humphries said Fitzpatrick never gave up \u2014 and wouldn't let his teammates, either.\n\n\"He's a veteran, and he knows how to bounce back and handle adversity,\" Humphries said. \"Even after the pick, he wasn't shaken up at all. You could just tell he was composed and was able to put a couple good drives together.\"\n\nSaid Fitzpatrick: \"Yeah, there was a lot of time left in the fourth quarter there when we brought it within seven. The thing I think about in our huddle is there is always that optimism and confidence, no matter who we are playing, no matter what the score is, winning or losing, we know what we are capable of. That is always a great feeling to know that, that huddle has that kind of confidence.\"\n\nAlthough the Bucs (3-5) have lost four of their last five and are four games behind the Saints and three behind the Panthers in the NFC South, Fitzpatrick remains upbeat that they can turn things around in the second half of the season.\n\nTampa Bay hosts Washington next week and then visits the New York Giants, giving them a shot to get back to .500 on the season.\n\n\"We know we have the talent. We can't keep digging ourselves into these holes,\" Fitzpatrick said.\n\nFitzpatrick got the starting nod after Winston turned the ball over 11 times in the previous 3 \u00bd games after returning from a league-imposed three-game suspension. He nearly rallied the Bucs back last week against Cincinnati after replacing Winston, but the comeback fell short with the Bengals holding on for a 37-34 win.\n\n\"We go out, we get behind, we get killed in the second quarter, then rally like (heck) in the third quarter and then everybody thinks we're back in it and then we fade off at the end,\" Koetter said. \"That's definitely the pattern that we're in. If I knew one thing to fix it I'd do it right now, but I don't know what that is.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He threw three interceptions \u2014 one returned for a touchdown \u2014 to up his career total to 13 interceptions in just 153 passing attempts, including playoffs.\n\nBackup tight end Jason Croom lost a fumble , which was returned for another score.\n\nThe Bills (2-7) were held to under 10 points for the fifth time this season, and have managed just 96 in nine games.\n\nAnd the only bright side was Peterman's mean-nothing 1-yard touchdown run scored with 5:41 remaining to end Buffalo's touchdown drought at 187 minutes and 19 seconds. It was the Bills' eighth TD of the season, and first since Peterman's 16-yard pass to Zay Jones in the fourth quarter of a 20-13 loss at Houston three weeks ago.\n\n\"It was like a domino effect today,\" receiver Kelvin Benjamin said. \"It just kept stacking up on us. We really couldn't catch back up.\"\n\nHe was referring to a second quarter in which the Bears scored 28 points in span of 12:20, included Eddie Jackson's 65-yard fumble return and Leonard Floyd returning a pass that tipped off of Jones' hands 19 yards for a score.\n\n\"I don't have the exact answer for it,\" Jones said. \"I don't think I see anybody that's not trying to give it their all. That's the most discouraging thing about the whole situation right now is that the effort is there.\"\n\nFrustration is setting in on a team that has lost four straight and, off to its worst start since losing eight of its nine first games in 2010.\n\nThe Bills had no choice but to start Peterman , with rookie Josh Allen missing his third straight game with a sprained right elbow and Derek Anderson sidelined by a concussion.\n\nThough Peterman's struggles were anticipated, the Bills have no solutions in spurring a running attack that is suddenly regressing.\n\nA week after LeSean McCoy had 13 yards on 12 carries in a 25-6 loss to New England , the running back was limited to 10 yards on 10 carries against the Bears.\n\nMcDermott even made the decision to sit McCoy for a majority of the second half while he tinkered with his offensive line. Rookie Wyatt Teller saw playing time at left guard, while Jeremiah Sirles eventually split time at right tackle.\n\nMcDermott was vague in saying he sat McCoy because of what the Bears were doing schematically.\n\nMcCoy, meantime, didn't stick around to share his thoughts. He was spotted exiting the locker room before reporters were allowed to enter.\n\nThough Peterman will bear the brunt of the blame, not all the interceptions were his fault.\n\nNewly signed receiver Terrelle Pryor caught Peterman's pass and lost control as he turned up field, with the ball landing in defensive back Adrian Amos' hands. Three snaps into Buffalo's next possession, Peterman's hard pass over the middle struck Jones in the hand and bounced directly to Floyd, who returned it for a touchdown.\n\nPeterman finished 31 of 49 for 189 yards and sacked four times in an outing reminiscent of his previous meltdowns. Peterman lost the starting job after faltering midway through a season-opening 47-3 loss at Baltimore. And then there were the five interceptions he threw in a 54-24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers a year ago.\n\n\"I think I don't feel snake-bitten. I never feel like a victim or anything like that,\" Peterman said. \"It's life. Things don't always bounce your way.\"\n\nBenjamin rallied to Peterman's support, saying it's unfair to pin the blame on him.\n\n\"We know how the outside world works. They're going to bash him and try to break his confidence. But Nate's a good dude,\" Benjamin said. \"Unfortunately, bad things keep happening.

(Photo: Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA highly anticipated matchup between the NFC\u2019s elite did not disappoint. The Saints came in with a six-game win streak and extended it to seven, outgunning the Rams 45-35 to hand Los Angeles its first loss of the season.\n\nHere are three things we learned in this game.\n\n1.) The Saints\u2019 defense is underrated\n\nThe Saints and Rams' offenses drew much of the attention entering this game given the units' video-game-like explosiveness, elite-level passers and big-play running backs and receivers. But the Saints won Sunday's game over the Rams thanks in large part to their defense.\n\nNew Orleans' unit entered the game ranked in middle-of-the-pack in several categories, and it appeared to be particularly vulnerable to the pass. But the Saints\u2019 defenders delivered huge stands for their team late in the first half and again with the game on the line in the fourth quarter. Three strong stands in the second quarter led to a turnover on downs and an interception. New Orleans\u2019 offense then cashed those possessions in and notched three straight touchdowns, which gave them a 35-17 halftime lead.\n\nThe Rams did come back in the second half and tied the score 35-35 with nine minutes left. But that\u2019s when the Saints buckled back down on defense and held the Rams\u2019 scoreless the remainder of the game thanks largely to key pass breakups and quarterback pressures. In contrast, the Rams\u2019 defense did well in the third quarter but then wilted in the fourth. The group struggled on third downs for much of the game and failed to deliver much-needed stops.\n\nMore: Michael Thomas replicates ex-Saints WR Joe Horn's famous cellphone celebration vs. Rams\n\n2. The Rams miss Aqib Talib\n\nThe Rams have invested heavily in their defense, but it\u2019s evident that the absence of No. 1 cornerback Aqib Talib, who is still rehabbing from ankle surgery, is no small thing. Marcus Peters did well in the first two games of the season, but he has struggled while having to fill that top role. On Sunday night, he had one of his worst games as Michael Thomas hauled in 12 catches for 211 yards and a touchdown on 15 targets. Thomas\u2019 biggest play came when he torched Peters for a 72-yard touchdown pass that put the Saints up 44-35 with 3:42 left in the game.\n\nLos Angeles' pass rushers didn\u2019t generate as much pressure as they would have liked, but they didn\u2019t have much help from the secondary in preventing Brees from making quick throws. The Rams haven\u2019t revealed a return date for Talib, but they hope to get him back late in the season. His healthy return will be crucial, particularly in the playoffs given the strong possibility they will see the Saints again.\n\n3. The Saints are the most complete team\n\nThe Rams have the more star-studded defense, but it\u2019s clear that the Saints are the most complete team in the NFC. Sean Payton and Sean McVay share a mutual admiration for each other and often study each other's film and game plans in hopes of learning something that will help their own offenses operate better. Payton and McVay both delivered electrifying performances as play-callers, but it was the Saints leader who got the best of the younger coach this time.\n\nGive the Saints\u2019 offensive line much credit: Not only did they pave the way for a strong rushing attack, but they didn\u2019t surrender a sack to a vaunted Los Angeles front. And despite MVP candidate Todd Gurley's obvious value, New Orleans had the edge at running back due to the versatility they have with Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram.

He didn't see David Moore running open behind him in the back of the end zone, and as the pass floated past, Addae reached out his right arm as far as he could.\n\n\"I got my last fingernail on it,\" Addae said. \"I barely snipped it.\"\n\nAnother last-second challenge for the Los Angeles Chargers defense. Another victory for the surging Chargers, holding off Wilson's late rally for a 25-17 win over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.\n\nThe Chargers won their fifth straight, putting a capper on Philip Rivers' 200th consecutive start with another clutch defensive stand. Rivers threw two touchdowns, Melvin Gordon ran for 113 yards, yet those two were standing on the sideline watching after a pass interference call against Michael Davis on the final play of regulation gave Seattle an untimed down and a chance to force overtime.\n\nAnd just like they did in London when the Chargers denied Tennessee's 2-point conversion attempt to preserve a 20-19 win, the defense came through again.\n\n\"It shouldn't have come down to that but it did,\" Rivers said. \"We found a way to win. These kinds of wins are huge.\"\n\nRivers threw touchdown passes of 12 yards to Tyrell Williams and 30 yards to Mike Williams, and let the Chargers defense stymie Wilson until the final minutes. Seattle had won four of five following a 0-2 start.\n\nDesmond King provided the deciding points for Los Angeles (6-2) by stepping in front of Wilson's pass for Moore and returning it 42 yards for a touchdown with 6:44 remaining to give the Chargers a 25-10 lead.\n\nWilson managed to make the final minutes nervous for Los Angeles.\n\n\"We had a chance to win a game that's right there for us,\" Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \"It was going to be dramatic, but we're OK about that.\"\n\nWilson hit Nick Vannett on a 6-yard TD with 1:50 remaining to cut the Chargers' lead to one score. Seattle got the ball back with 1:24 left at its own 22 and after two completions and a roughing the passer penalty on Melvin Ingram, the Seahawks were at the Chargers 44 with 50 seconds left. Wilson scrambled for 16 yards to the Chargers 28 and, after a spike, Seattle had 30 seconds left.\n\nSeattle (4-4) got a break when Davis was called for pass interference in the end zone on the final play of regulation against Tyler Lockett, putting the ball at the 1 for an untimed down. Seattle's J.R. Sweezy was called for false start backing the play up to the 6, and Wilson's final attempt for Moore in the back of the end zone was partially tipped by Addae and fell incomplete.\n\n\"It's like winning a playoff game,\" Chargers defensive lineman Brandon Mebane said. \"That was like a playoff game.\"\n\nWilson was 26 of 39 for 235 yards, and threw a 10-yard TD pass to Jaron Brown on Seattle's opening drive.\n\nRivers became the fourth quarterback in league history to start 200 straight games, joining Brett Favre, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning. Favre started an NFL-record 297 straight times in the regular season. This wasn't like his 2010 performance in Seattle when Rivers threw for 455 yards, but he made key throws at important times, especially in the first half. The Chargers averaged 10 yards per play in the first half and scored touchdowns on three of their five possessions, the last one taking just 55 seconds to find the end zone on a 30-yard catch-and-run by Mike Williams.\n\nGordon averaged 7.1 yards per carry and ran through huge holes in the second half. His 34-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter gave him 34 TDs in his past 36 games after going scoreless in his first 14 games.\n\nSeattle also didn't have answers for Keenan Allen, who had 124 yards on six receptions.\n\n\"It's great, any time we can go on the road, loudest place in the league and get a win the way we did,\" Allen said. \"I thought it was dominating, outside the points we missed, but pretty great.\"\n\nINJURIES\n\nCarson didn't play much after the first quarter, spending most of the time on the sideline with a wrap on his upper left leg due to a hip injury. Carson had 40 yards on eight carries before going to the bench. ... Seattle played the second half without starting strong safety Bradley McDougald due to a knee injury. He had been questionable on the final injury report. ... Guard D.J. Fluker injured a leg in the fourth quarter.\n\nREMEMBERING PAUL\n\nSeattle played a lengthy tribute video honoring owner Paul Allen who died on Oct. 15 due to complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. They also had a moment of silence for Allen and had the \"12 Flag\" that's raised before every game lowered to half-staff.\n\nSeattle also had logos added to the field reading \"PGA\" similar to the patches the team had added to its uniforms.\n\n\"We love the spirit that he stood for,\" Carroll said. \"He affected all of us... his wisdom and his charity and his love for this area.\"\n\nKICKING WOES\n\nChargers kicker Caleb Sturgis might be looking for a new job after missing two extra points and a 42-yard field goal attempt.

But from a bunker right of the green on the par-3 17th, Cantlay was fooled by the amount of sand under his ball and flubbed the shot.\n\nOne hole behind him, DeChambeau rolled in his long eagle putt from just off the green and celebrated with a big uppercut.

But this time I've got the double kind of winning feeling, so it might be a bit more fun to celebrate it at this time.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old from England needed help from Li, who closed with a 71 and lost the playoff with a three-putt bogey from just inside 10 feet.\n\n\"It's a tough day for me,\" Li said. \"I think I played well the whole week, but didn't hole a few putts on the last and that was it.\"\n\nRose does not plan to play the next Rolex Series event in South Africa and was not planning to play in DP Tour World Championship that wraps up the Race to Dubai.\n\nLPGA TOUR\n\nSHIGA, Japan (AP) \u2014 Local favorite Nasa Hataoka shot a 5-under 67 to win the Japan Classic for her second LPGA title of the season.\n\nHataoka offset a pair of bogeys with seven birdies at the Seta Golf Club to finish at 14-under 202, two strokes ahead of compatriots Momoka Ueda, Saki Nagamine and Spain's Carlota Ciganda, who all shot 68.\n\nThe 19-year-old Hataoka also won the Arkansas Championship in June.\n\nSouth Korean players Jin Young Ko (66) and Ji-Hee Lee (68) tied for fifth at 11 under.\n\nOvernight leader Minjee Lee struggled with her game and had back-to-back bogeys on Nos. 7 and 8 as part of a 78 that left her tied for 15th.\n\nThe LPGA stop in Japan is the fourth of five consecutive tournaments across Asia.\n\nOTHER TOURS\n\nShaun Norris closed with a 3-under 69 for a one-shot victory over Daisuke Kataoka in the Heiwa PGM Championship on the Japan Golf Tour.

Watt said of Thomas, whom the Texans (6-3) acquired five days earlier from the Broncos (3-6).\n\nOnly, Thomas lost the coin flip and didn't exactly walk off the field a winner \u2014 he sprinted.\n\n\"I think that's the fastest I ran all day,\" Thomas said. \"I ran inside. We got that W.\"\n\nDeShaun Watson targeted Thomas three times and Thomas caught all three for 61 yards, including back-to-back grabs for 31 and 18 yards on Houston's opening touchdown drive.\n\nBut he stood to be the goat after a series of fourth-quarter follies that including a false start, lining up in the wrong spot \u2014 even having to run over and ask Watson what to do \u2014 and having to burn a timeout.\n\n\"I messed up a couple of times and I felt like it would have been on me if we didn't get that W,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"He was hearing one thing and doing the opposite,\" Watson said. \"I had to make sure he was on the same page as me.

It backfired when the Texans got the ball in Broncos territory and 18 seconds left in the first half and Ka'imi Fairbairn nailed a 46-yard do-over for a 16-10 Houston halftime lead after his errant attempt was wiped away because Joseph had called timeout to ice him.\n\nJoseph said he didn't try to get closer for McManus' game-winning attempt because the Broncos had already reached their \"line to go\" inside the 35.\n\n\"I was totally confident in Brandon,\" Miller said. \"From 62 and 51, my money's on Brandon. He's our sniper. He's our brother. It's one of the hardest positions in pro sports. Sometimes you just can't put it through the uprights.\"\n\nSaid Keenum: \"I knew Brandon was going to make it and I still know he's going to make it when we give him that chance again. I think he's the best kicker in the league.\"\n\nKeenum threw a 5-yard pass to tight end Jeff Heuerman, who had a career-best 10 catches for 83 yards and then running back Phillip Lindsay lost a yard, leaving McManus with a 51-yard attempt.\n\nAfter the Broncos took a 17-16 lead on Keenum's 12-yard dart to Heuerman between two defenders, Fairbairn put the Texans back ahead with a 37-yard field goal with 14:06 remaining.\n\nIt turned out to be the game-winner when McManus missed again.\n\n\"Seeing the kick go wide right was a breath of fresh air,\" Texans safety Tyrann Mathieu said.\n\nParticularly for Thomas.\n\nTHOMAS TRIBUTE\n\nThomas had started all 114 games for the Broncos since Jan. 8, 2012, when he caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Tim Tebow on the first snap of overtime to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 29-23.\n\nThis time, he drew loud ovations when he emerged from the tunnel for pregame stretch and again during a video tribute after \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nOutside the stadium, the Broncos put up a giant \"Thank you, D.T.\" banner at the bottom of a 10-story-high image of Thomas next to one of Von Miller, who said last week it was \"super weird\" not having Thomas as a teammate anymore.\n\nAfter Thomas lost the coin toss, Denver deferred and Thomas went right to work , catching consecutive passes covering 31 and 18 yards as the Texans took a quick 7-0 lead on Watson's 7-yard TD pass to tight end Jordan Thomas .\n\nWatson's 36th career TD throw was a 16-yarder to DeAndre Hopkins that put Houston ahead 13-3.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions were at a disadvantage, playing in a deafening stadium against a daunting Minnesota defense that's rounding into form at midseason.\n\nThe departure of their leading pass-catcher in a trade earlier in the week left the Lions with one less way to attack the Vikings, but the absence of Golden Tate became an afterthought while the team struggled to protect its quarterback. Matthew Stafford was culpable, too, often hanging onto the ball too long.\n\nDanielle Hunter had 3 1/2 of Minnesota's franchise-record 10 sacks plus a fourth-quarter fumble return for a touchdown , making for a miserable afternoon for Stafford and the Lions in a 24-9 victory by the Vikings on Sunday.\n\n\"That's a very, very, very, very talented front,\" left guard Frank Ragnow said. \"Dudes on every single position. So credit to them, but it's all on us. I think we all know we need to play better than that.\"\n\nHunter also was credited with nine tackles and four hits on Stafford as the Vikings (5-3-1) limited the Lions to a season-low 214 total yards and stopped their streak of 14-plus points at 25 straight games. The last time the Lions scored in single digits was a 17-6 loss to the New York Giants on Dec. 18, 2016.\n\nThe Lions assembled only two drives that netted more than 30 yards. Tate was certainly missed \u2014 the Lions went just 4 for 15 on third down \u2014 but the Vikings dominated this game on the line of scrimmage.\n\n\"You're going to play some teams that are going to have some really elite rushers and who are really elite players,\" left tackle Taylor Decker said. \"We know in our division, we're going to get that every week. It's a tough pill to swallow, but we have to play better.\"\n\nThe previous high sack total of Stafford's 10-year career was seven, against the Vikings in 2015. He has been sacked five times or more on 15 different occasions, six of those by the Vikings. The Lions are 3-12 in those games.\n\n\"We need to learn how to be consistent all the way across the board with everything we do,\" coach Matt Patricia said. \"There have been some weeks we have been consistent from the start of the week through the games, and some weeks haven't been consistent. Things change on gameday pretty quick depending on the opponent and what they're doing, and being able to handle some of those changes affects that.\"\n\nThe Vikings effectively mixed in blitzes to keep the Lions off balance, but nine of the 10 sacks were registered by their defensive linemen. Three of them came inside Minnesota's 20, over two different possessions that ended with a field goal by Matt Prater.\n\nDefensive tackles Sheldon Richardson and Tom Johnson switched places on a perfectly executed stunt that ended with them sharing a sack of Stafford on third-and-goal from the 8 early in the second quarter. Everson Griffen pushed Decker back toward Stafford, too, in a complete collapse of the pocket.\n\n\"If we go into the red zone and we score touchdowns there, then the score of the game would've been a lot different,\" Stafford said. \"We've got to get better.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Richard) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The coach changed. Everything else with the Cleveland Browns stayed the same.\n\nUnable to slow Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City's thrill-a-minute offense, the Browns were soundly beaten \u2014 and beaten up \u2014 in a 37-21 loss on Sunday in Cleveland's first game under interim coach Gregg Williams.\n\nMahomes threw two touchdown passes to Cleveland native Travis Kelce and Kareem Hunt, another local kid who drove past FirstEnergy Stadium almost every day, scored three TDs as the Chiefs (8-1) overpowered the banged-up Browns (2-6-1) while sending them to their fourth straight loss.\n\nIt doesn't figure to get better anytime soon for Cleveland, which had three more defensive starters get injured.\n\nThe pain isn't going away.\n\n\"We have to keep going \u2014 next man up,\" defensive end Myles Garrett said. \"We have to do the best with what we have.\"\n\nThe loss ended another tumultuous few days for the Browns, whose promising 2-2-1 start has dissolved into more disarray.\n\nStill, rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield managed to extract some positives. He passed for 297 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"Offensively, I think there was a lot more good in this game than we had in the past,\" said Mayfield, who twice connected with running back Duke Johnson on scores. \"There is a lot to build on, but there is obviously so much more room for improvement. When you are playing a team like that, you have to stay in the game.\n\n\"You have to give yourself chances. You have to do the little things right. You have to chip away, take time off of the clock just because of the offense that they have. There was a lot of good on offense, but we just have to keep getting better.\"\n\nCleveland's hopes of staying with the Chiefs took a major hit when defensive backs Damarious Randall (groin), E.J. Gaines (concussion) and Denzel Ward (hip) were sidelined by injuries. Randall was scratched before the kickoff, and after Gaines and Ward went down in the first quarter, linebacker Christian Kirksey (hamstring) got hurt.\n\nStopping the Chiefs with a full roster is tough.\n\nShort-handed, it's impossible.\n\nThe Browns were already missing Pro Bowl linebacker Joe Schobert, who sat out his third game in a row with a hamstring injury.\n\n\"The biggest thing that really affected us was that we lost two of our starting corners in the first drive,\" cornerback T.J. Carrie said. \"That definitely put us in a different situation. We practice with those guys throughout the week, and when those guys go down, it changes the game plan. They are a high-powered offense, and I don't think we did a good job at all stopping their momentum.\"\n\nThe injuries put more pressure on Williams, who did not relinquish his duties as defensive coordinator after being asked to replace Hue Jackson, who was fired on Monday along with offensive coordinator Todd Haley.\n\nThe Browns may have been outmanned by the more talented Chiefs, but Williams liked how his players fought through a week full of adversity.\n\n\"I never saw any flinch,\" he said. \"Never saw a flinch today. Never saw body language poor today. You have to build on that. This is the National Football League. There are no excuses. You have to continue to get better. You have to. We all have to.\"\n\nWilliams set an early tone for his shell-shocked team with a fourth-down gamble on Cleveland's first possession. The Browns converted then, but Williams' choice to go for a 2-point conversion in the second quarter resulted in the Browns chasing points all afternoon.\n\nCleveland went 0 for 3 on conversion tries.\n\nFollowing the game, Mayfield and Mahomes met at mid-field and shared a hug and some words of encouragement. They've been friends for years, college rivals and part of the NFL's next wave of young quarterbacks.\n\nWhile Mahomes appears to have it all \u2014 more talented teammates, a stable franchise \u2014 right now, Mayfield doesn't think the Browns have to try to replicate Kansas City's offense.\n\n\"What we do is perfectly fine,\" he said. \"We just have to be better at it. They have guys who are making their plays. Their quarterback is putting it in the right spot. He is giving them a chance to win. We just have to be better. We are not going to abandon ship with what we are doing and try to do the Chiefs offense. We just have to trust our guys, trust our playmakers and do our job.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Lately, though, those chances inside the 20 have resulted in field goals.\n\nTwice in the first half, the Ravens drove deep into Pittsburgh territory and had to settle for field goals.\n\n\"It's frustrating because in these types of games, you don't get that many plays and that many opportunities, and obviously, scoring touchdowns is the name of the game,\" quarterback Joe Flacco said.\n\nIn the first half, Pittsburgh scored two touchdowns and the Ravens got two field goals. That put Baltimore in a hole from which it could not recover.\n\n\"It helps if you can run it in,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nThe Ravens have yet to get their running game on track. On Sunday, they finished with 61 yards rushing \u2014 including two attempts for 4 yards after halftime.\n\n\"I think we can turn it around,\" wide receiver John Brown said. Brown was Flacco's go-to guy early in the season, but his effectiveness has been negated by frequent double teams.\n\n\"Things happen. We have to find a way to get it right,\" Brown said.\n\nBut a struggling offense is only one of Baltimore's issues.\n\nThe NFL's most dominant defense has suddenly become vulnerable to the pass, particularly the underneath routes that elongate drives and turn short throws into big gainers.\n\n\"They kept us on the field for a lot of long drives, just grinding us down,\" defensive end Brent Urban said. \"You can't win like that.\"\n\nSince blanking the Titans 21-0 in Week 6, the Ravens have yielded 82 points in three defeats. Sixty-seven of those points came in a stretch of six periods through halftime of Sunday's loss.\n\n\"That's not up to our defensive standard,\" defensive back Anthony Levine said. \"We know what our standard is, and that isn't it.\"\n\nWith the Ravens struggling at the bye and in danger of missing the postseason for the fourth year in a row, it's only natural that Harbaugh would start fielding questions about job security. He said Sunday he wasn't concerned with being fired.\n\n\"I've never been someone who's worried about keeping a job,\" he said. \"It's always been, for me, (about) doing the job.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Team owner Steve Bisciotti admitted in February that he weighed dismissing Harbaugh after last season, when a loss in the regular-season finale extended the Ravens' playoff drought.)\n\n\"I haven't seen that, I don't know,\" Harbaugh replied when asked if he's on the hot seat. \"I've never been somebody that worried about keeping a job.\n\n\"We'll keep fighting, and that's what we do.\"\n\nYet beyond that, Harbaugh seemed like a man grasping for answers.\n\n\"I just told (the players), 'You know, we lost three games in a row. What does that mean we need to do?' They all said, 'We gotta win three games in a row,' \" he said. \"That's what we need to do. There are seven games left in the season. There's a lot of football left to be played.\"\n\nMore: Bills QB Nathan Peterman takes inauspicious place in NFL history in rout by Bears\n\nHarbaugh cited the need for a week off, hoping a roster that had 10 players on the injury report emerges healthier after the break. Starting tackles Ronnie Stanley and James Hurst were both out against the Steelers, who limited the Ravens to a season-low 268 yards and 23:31 time of possession.\n\nDefensively, Baltimore couldn't get off the field, allowing Pittsburgh to convert 10 of 16 third-down attempts on the way to surrendering 395 yards, in excess of 100 more than it concedes on average. The Ravens' top-ranked defense hadn't allowed more than six third-down conversions in any other game this season.\n\n\"We're gonna look hard at what we can do,\" added Harbaugh, who lost to a division opponent at home in November for the first time in his career (previously 7-0). \"We've got to score more points, get more yards \u2014 especially \u2014 score in the red zone. We were scoring in the red zone really well early in the year, and that's dried up.\"\n\nAll true certainly, especially in regard to a team that began the season by scoring a record 12 touchdowns in its first 12 trips inside the opposing 20-yard line. The Ravens were 1-for-4 inside the red zone Sunday while Pittsburgh was 3-for-4.\n\nGame. Set. Match.\n\nBut it may be time to hope for more than better execution in crucial situations, rejuvenated troops and fanciful win streaks.\n\nWould firing Harbaugh in a bid to spark the team work? Seems doubtful at this juncture given that kind of gambit rarely pays dividends in the NFL. The players also broadly seem to support a coach who led the franchise to its second Super Bowl victory to cap the 2012 season.\n\n\"This team believes in him,\" said safety Eric Weddle \u2014 who is clearly open to new ideas himself given the drastic trim to his trademark beard.\n\n\"He's an unbelievable man.\"\n\nMaybe it's time to try Ty Montgomery, inactive Sunday after being acquired from the Packers at the trade deadline, to spark a largely dormant ground attack (61 yards Sunday).\n\nThe more drastic move would be to bench struggling quarterback Joe Flacco in favor of rookie Lamar Jackson, the final first-round pick made by outgoing general manager Ozzie Newsome.\n\n\"I'd like to see him out there more,\" Harbaugh said of Jackson, citing the success New Orleans had in Baltimore two weeks ago while using quarterbacks Drew Brees and multi-dimensional Taysom Hill.\n\nHarbaugh didn't signal any desire to sit Flacco, who's clearly still the more effective passer even as his tenure as the starter looks to be winding down. Yet the Jackson packages seem to produce little in the way of explosive plays \u2014 he completed one pass for 12 yards Sunday, and gained only 10 yards on five carries.\n\nAnd his presence seems almost counterproductive as he cycles in and out of the huddle. Flacco \u2014 yes, he was operating behind a decimated line \u2014 was never in rhythm against Pittsburgh and missed a wide-open Jackson for a potential touchdown on one drive that ended in a field goal and Michael Crabtree in the flat on another play that could have produced seven points when the Ravens ultimately settled for three.\n\nMaking Jackson a regular component of the offense would certainly result in rookie mistakes. Yet it would also force defenses to spy on him and could open up things not only downfield, but on the ground, where run-pass options could become a more effective element.\n\nAs it is, when Jackson enters the game, Flacco inevitably splits out wide as a decoy no defender is falling for \u2014 especially given Flacco, who has seemed exasperated by the lack of flow, hardly tries to sell any notion he's actually an option.\n\n\"We'll look at everything, we always do in the bye week,\" said Harbaugh.\n\nThe players seem resolute, refusing to panic amid the struggles nor paying heed to the rumor mill.\n\n\"Let them keep talking,\" said cornerback Brandon Carr. \"We have everything we need in this locker room.\"\n\nSaid Harbaugh: \"We'll determine our own fate.\"\n\nUntil someone else does it first.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "CLOSE \"UglyDolls\" unveils its first trailer, featuring Kelly Clarkson as the wonderfully weird Moxy.
