(AP Photo/Butch Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Alabama's offense didn't put up the video game-like numbers that had seemingly become commonplace. The defense played so well, again, that it didn't matter.\n\nThe top-ranked Crimson Tide had its second straight shutout in a 24-0 victory over No. 18 Mississippi State on Saturday, while Josh Jacobs ran for a touchdown and caught a scoring pass.\n\nWith quarterback Tua Tagovailoa still battling a gimpy right knee, the Tide (10-0, 7-0 Southeastern Conference, No. 1 CFP) turned to defense for another vintage performance.\n\n\"I think in this day and age, you not only get judged on whether you win but you get judged on how you win,\" Tide coach Nick Saban said. \"I never thought I'd ever be in position to say that you get style points but the way our system is, that may be the way it is.\"\n\nThe offense had already banked plenty of style \u2014 and real \u2014 points along the way.\n\nAlabama raced to a fast start but mostly stalled from there against the Bulldogs (6-4, 2-4) and the nation's No. 2 scoring defense.\n\nTagovailoa started the fourth quarter on a stationary bike after getting his right knee checked out in the medical tent following a low hit. He didn't return and wasn't needed, mainly because of a defense that was overshadowed by an offense that had led the nation in scoring much of the season.\n\nSaban said Tagovailoa could have returned if needed.\n\n\"He got hit low a few times out there today,\" Saban said. \"He got hit in the front of the knee and not the back, which is where his problem was. I think he's OK.\"\n\nFresh from a 29-0 victory over No. 9 LSU, the Tide defense hasn't allowed a point in nine-plus quarters. It's the first time Alabama has had consecutive shutouts since beating Western Carolina and Auburn to end the 2012 regular season.\n\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Tide linebacker Dylan Moses said. \"It means we got the job done.\"\n\nAlabama had five sacks and Mississippi State had four in a rough day for both quarterbacks against two talent-rich defensive lines.\n\nTagovailoa was 14 of 21 for 164 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He also lost a fumble on a botched exchange with Damien Harris.\n\nBackup Jalen Hurts missed his second straight game with an ankle injury.\n\nJacobs ran for 97 yards on 20 carries as Alabama. He scored on a 1-yard run and a 14-yard catch.\n\nThe Bulldogs stuffed Harris on the goal line on a late fourth-down attempt.\n\n\"I think certainly, defensively, we continue to play well,\" Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said. \"We continue to fight our tails off. We held them under 350 yards. It was most prominent bowing their back on that last drive and keeping them out of the end zone. That's the type of pride and physicality we play with defensively. We certainly gave ourselves an opportunity with how we played.\"\n\nNick Fitzgerald was 11 of 20 for 125 yards for Mississippi State, which gained just 44 yards on 30 rushes.\n\nAlabama scored touchdowns on its first two drives, consuming more than 10 minutes combined with 156 yards. The Bulldogs mostly held the Tide's prolific offense in check after that.\n\nAlabama outgained Mississippi State 305-169 in total yards.\n\nThe Tide's third TD was set up by a fumbled punt return at Mississippi State's 27 in the second quarter.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMississippi State: Penalties helped cost opportunities to make this game close as Bulldogs couldn't cash in on several promising drives. Kylin Hill had a 38-yard run but the running game couldn't get much going beyond that.\n\nAlabama: Didn't have a play longer than 25 yards on offense. Defense had 10 tackles for loss and Alabama didn't commit a penalty. Guard Deonte Brown went down with turf toe.\n\nHOME STREAK\n\nAlabama matched the school record with its 24th consecutive home victory. The mark was initially set from 1971-74 at Legion Field and Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\n___\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMississippi State hosts Arkansas in another SEC West matchup.\n\nAlabama hosts The Citadel in what should amount to a break before the Auburn game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Right after, he dropped to a knee and asked for his girlfriend's hand in marriage.\n\nA sterling performance that turned into a diamond experience.\n\nThe script couldn't have gone anymore smooth for the Air Force sophomore tailback as he had a career-best 99 yards rushing in leading the Falcons to a 42-24 win over New Mexico on Saturday.\n\nHis pre-engagement jitters turned into postgame nerves once time expired.

Pittsburgh won 52-22.(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Qadree Ollison looked at the line of scrimmage, looked at the Virginia Tech end zone 97 long yards away and turned to good friend and fellow Pittsburgh running back Darrin Hall.\n\n\"I asked him if he thought I could run that far and he was like, 'I don't know,'\" Ollison said with a laugh.\n\nThe answer unfolded over 17 seconds that began with textbook blocking at the snap, included a vicious stiff-arm at midfield and ended with Ollison flipping across the goal line to finish off the longest offensive play in the program's 114-year history to provide a giddy exclamation point as the Panthers took a massive step toward their first ACC Coastal Division title with a dominant 52-22 victory over the reeling Hokies on Saturday.\n\n\"It was perfect,\" Ollison said after finishing with 235 yards and three touchdowns. \"It parted like the Red Sea and as a running back it's my job to make a guy miss. It's my job to run a guy over, not let one guy tackle you and after (breaking free), I did.\"\n\nYet it's what happened in the immediate aftermath that the Panthers believe speaks volumes about their team and the bond Ollison and Hall have formed over the last four years while taking turns atop the depth chart. Ollison's record-breaking sprint broke the previous record of 92 yards set by Hall set last season against Duke. And Hall couldn't have been happier.\n\n\"I'm glad he got it,\" said Hall after running for 186 yards and a touchdown of his own on Senior Day. \"It's a blessing because he deserves it for everything he's done for this university.\"\n\nThe Panthers (6-4, 5-1 ACC) rolled up a school-record 654 total yards, 492 coming on the ground, the second-most ever given up by the Hokies (4-5, 3-3).\n\n\"Obviously, we had trouble and they ran the ball awfully well,\" Virginia Tech head coach Justin Fuente said. \"Kind of a weird deal ... we didn't play as well as we would've liked to.\"\n\nRyan Willis threw for 231 yards and three touchdowns for the Hokies (4-5, 3-3), two of them to Eric Kumah, but Virginia Tech's defense offered little resistance. A season that began with such promise now finds the Hokies needing to win each of their final two games if they want to extend their bowl streak to 26 seasons.\n\n\"It's not foremost in my mind,\" Fuente said. \"I've got plenty of other things to worry about right now.\"\n\nPitt's concerns are far different. The team that found itself floundering at 2-3 at the end of September after getting blown out by Central Florida now needs to win just one of its final two games to earn a trip to the ACC title game on the first Saturday in December.\n\n\"I know everyone wanted to jump ship after that (UCF) game but there was no doubt in my mind,\" Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett said. \"We showed it with our play and how confident we are in each other.\"\n\nDespite the stakes, the Panthers insisted they were focused on avenging a 20-14 loss at Virginia Tech last November. Pitt had four chances from just outside the goal line in the final seconds to pull out the victory at Lane Stadium only to get stopped short, a setback that ultimately prevented the Panthers from earning a bowl bid.\n\nStill, Pitt head coach Pat Narduzzi said he wasn't worried about his team's ability to deliver if put in a similar spot, and the Panthers spent four quarters putting on a clinic. Hall and Ollison spent most of the afternoon roaring through gaping holes and responding in the second half whenever Virginia Tech attempted to get back in it.\n\n\"Whatever we wanted, we got,\" Pickett said. \"So it was a good day.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVirginia Tech: The Hokies don't appear interested in tackling anybody. Defensive coordinator Bud Foster hoped his young group would have learned after getting run over in losses to Georgia Tech and Boston College. Instead it was more of the same. Pitt's offensive line bullied Virginia Tech on a day the Panthers averaged 13.9 yards per play.\n\nPitt: The Panthers have developed a hard-earned reputation for stumbling when given an opportunity to produce a true breakthrough moment. It looked like the latest edition of \"Pitt-ing\" might come in the second quarter when Pickett fumbled going into the end zone, Virginia Tech recovered for a touchback and then went down and scored to draw within 17-7. This time, however, the Panthers didn't panic. Pickett directed two touchdown drives before the end of the first half to put the Panthers up 31-7 at the break. The Hokies never drew closer than 16 the rest of the way.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVirginia Tech: Welcomes Miami to Lane Stadium next Saturday.\n\nPitt: Travels to Wake Forest next Saturday in the first meeting between the two schools since Pitt joined the ACC in 2013.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Up ahead, another week with national title hopes in the Big House.\n\n\"The one thing I think we do a really good job of is not getting distracted by where we are now,\" Patterson said, \"and don't let that distract us from where we want to be.\"\n\nThe Wolverines (9-1, 7-0, No. 4 CFP) remain in first place in the Big Ten's East Division. They have a final tuneup against Indiana next weekend before closing the regular season at No. 8 Ohio State.\n\nMichigan hasn't lost since the season opener against No. 3 Notre Dame and would have to beat the Buckeyes for just the second time in 15 years to keep any hope at a national title alive.\n\nPatterson kept his focus and Michigan reaped the rewards.\n\nThe Wolverines showed no signs of any slipup against lowly Rutgers (1-9, 0-7), holding the Scarlet Knights without a yard passing on the stat sheet until the third quarter. The Wolverines took the field on a chilly night in front of thousands of fans in blue-and-maize winter hats and jackets who turned Rutgers into a Big House East.\n\nMichigan's win was never in doubt \u2014 it was a 38 1/2-point favorite and had outscored Rutgers 162-30 over their last three meetings. Michigan's 78-0 win two years ago in Piscataway was perhaps the most horrifying defeat of Rutgers' 149 seasons.\n\nThe only upset Saturday came in the total time it took Michigan to score. The Wolverines didn't take the lead until Higdon's 1-yard run with 45 seconds left in the first quarter.\n\nRutgers tied it at 7 when Isaih Pacheco took off for an 80-yard TD run, the longest rushing score for a freshman in program history. He finished with 142 yards on 16 carries.\n\nA few thousand Rutgers fans were suddenly pumped, but the threat of a monster upset was quickly wiped out. Higdon gave Michigan a 14-7 lead on a 1-yard run, and Patterson hit Collins for a 36-yard score. Collins was comically open \u2014 the Rutgers students in the end-zone seats were closer to him than any defender \u2014 and it was clear at that point the Wolverines were rolling.\n\nPatterson continued to play like the quarterback the Wolverines have been missing in search of a national title for the Jim Harbaugh era. Patterson, named a finalist this week for the Davey O'Brien award, is on the board at Las Vegas with the third-best odds to win the Heisman Trophy. He didn't necessarily play like the best player in college football against Rutgers, but the Mississippi transfer didn't have to be at his best.\n\nPatterson has thrown a touchdown pass to seven receivers this season and No. 7 was Oliver Martin in the third quarter. Martin's 16-yard haul was his first career touchdown.\n\nPatterson had his fifth three-touchdown game of the season when he found Collins again for a 10-yard score and a 35-7 lead.\n\n\"That was a really tough night to throw the ball,\" Harbaugh said. \"It reminded me of my days back in Soldier Field playing in some of those windy conditions. He made some throws that were just unbelievable.\"\n\nMichigan waved its oversized \"M'' flag, and Rutgers fans said goodbye as they flocked toward the exits.\n\n\"They're probably playing as good as any team in the country,\" Rutgers coach Chris Ash said.\n\nPatterson again got a boost in the backfield from Higdon, who ran for 42 yards and became the first Michigan running back to top 1,000 yards rushing since Denard Robinson in 2012.\n\nChris Evans had a 61-yard touchdown run in the fourth for a 42-7 lead.\n\n\"It's unfortunate we gave up the long run at the end,\" Ash said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan: The Wolverines are the only undefeated Big Ten team in conference play and are looking for their first conference title since 2004. Their first national championship since 1997 certainly remains within reach.\n\nRutgers: Artur Sitkowski had a 16-yard pass completion in the third quarter to give Rutgers 16 yards passing. That's how bad the Scarlet Knights were in their toughest test to date. The only number more impossible to believe than the 0 in the yards passing column at halftime was the announced crowd of 43,786 in the stands.\n\nCALLING FOR BACKUP\n\nWith the game out of hand, Michigan gave backup quarterback Joe Milton some snaps.\n\nINJURY LIST\n\nMichigan cornerback Lavert Hill was treated for a possible concussion.\n\nWHO ARE YOU?\n\nHarbaugh might need a scorecard the next time he refers to Ash.\n\n\"Rob does a really good job with them,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan: Head home to play the plucky Hoosiers.\n\nRutgers: The Scarlet Knights host No. 21 Penn State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Andy Clayton-King) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Known for his catchphrases, Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck had one for his defense that he repeated often in the week after firing defensive coordinator Robb Smith: sound, simple fast.\n\nThe Gophers' maligned defense looked each part as it held Purdue to season-lows in yards and points for a 41-10 win against the Boilermakers in the cold and snow on Saturday.\n\nQuarterback Seth Green had a touchdown rushing and passing, and redshirt freshman Mohamed Ibrahim ran for 156 yards for Minnesota, which played its first game under interim defensive coordinator Joe Rossi.\n\nThe Gophers entered the game allowing 43.2 points and 507.7 yards per game, but linebacker Blake Cashman forced a fumble and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown as Minnesota (5-5, 2-5 Big Ten) held Purdue to 233 total yards and 0 of 12 on third down.\n\n\"Sound, simple, fast,\" Fleck said of the defensive philosophy. \"We didn't change our defense. The defense is the defense, and the defense works. We got back to us.\"\n\nSenior quarterback David Blough was 20 of 31 for 142 yards passing for the Boilermakers (5-5, 4-3), who entered the game second in the Big Ten scoring with 35.8 points per game.\n\n\"Really, just some selfish things that are going on that can't happen,\" Purdue coach Jeff Brohm said. \"Too many people that have patted themselves on the back too much, and listened to others instead of working their tail off and finding ways to improve, and understanding that all the little things matter, and realizing that the team comes first.\"\n\nFleck fired Smith a day after giving up 646 yards in a loss to Illinois last week. Rossi was the team's defensive line coach this season.\n\nThe announced 21-degree weather was the third-coldest start for a game in the 10-year history of TCF Bank Stadium. A light snow fell during much of second half in which Minnesota took control.\n\nCashman's fumble return for a touchdown on the opening drive started the half. The Gophers capped their first three offensive possessions of the second half with a touchdown.\n\n\"Simplified the game plan, which allows guys to play loose, play fast, give them that confidence out there,\" Cashman said of Rossi's impact. \"That's really important because I think we lost some of that against Illinois when they came out and hit us in the mouth early.\"\n\nThe longest drive for Purdue, which entered with 485.2 yards per game in Big Ten play, was 30 yards until midway through the fourth quarter when Blough connected with Moore for a 9-yard touchdown pass to cap a 75-yard drive.\n\n\"They run the same coverages, a few minor changes, but we couldn't get the run game going,\" Blough said. \"We weren't on all cylinders on the pass game, and it made it easier for them to kind of tee off on us.\"\n\nONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK\n\nAfter beating then-No. 2 Ohio State 49-20 on Oct. 20, Purdue went on the road and lost to Michigan State 23-13, with their previous worst offensive performance in Big Ten play. The Boilermakers were coming off a 38-36 win against then-No. 19 Iowa last week.\n\n\"I'll take full responsibility for it,\" Brohm said. \"We didn't have our guys ready to play. I think we somehow just thought we could just come out there, and the ball would bounce our way, and good things would happen.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nPurdue: The Boilermakers' chance to win the Big Ten's West division took a big hit with a second straight loss on the road. For any shot, Purdue will likely have to beat Wisconsin next week and hope for help against Northwestern. Of more concern is the bowl outlook gets cloudy as well. Purdue will need at least one win out of Wisconsin and Indiana.\n\nMinnesota: The defensive improvement sure changes the perception. The Gophers had allowed at least 30 points in every Big Ten game this season prior to Saturday. Beating Purdue gets Minnesota one game closer to bowl-eligible.

(AP) \u2014 There were no fireworks, no drama and that was exactly what Kermit Davis wanted in his Mississippi head coaching debut Saturday as the Rebels defeated Western Michigan 90-64.\n\n\"I'm really pleased. Really pleased. We played with energy, shared the ball and got on them defensively,\" Davis said. \"We got off to a good start and took a well-coached team out of what they wanted to do.\"\n\nTerence Davis scored 17 points to lead four in double figures for the Rebels (1-0), who led 43-22 at halftime and by as many as 29 points in the second half.

(AP) \u2014 Charlotte senior point guard Jon Davis said he never had a doubt that his game-winning 3-pointer off the glass with 0.6 left in the game was going in.\n\n\"Even if it did, I wouldn't tell you,\" Davis said with a grin.\n\nDavis scored a game-high 27 points, including five points in the final 4.2 seconds as Charlotte erased a 24-point deficit in the final 14 minutes to stun Oklahoma State 66-64 on Saturday and give Ron Sanchez his first win as the head coach.\n\nThe Cowboys led by three with 7 seconds left and tried to foul Davis to put him on the line for a 1-on-1 rather than allowing him to attempt a potential tying 3-pointer \u2014 a strategy that is often debated among college coaches. However, after the foul, officials gathered at the monitor at midcourt and called Oklahoma State's Lindy Waters for a flagrant foul.\n\nDavis made two free throws and Charlotte got the ball on the side with a chance to win.\n\nOn a designed play, Davis came off a screen and buried a jumper from 25 feet off the glass with two defenders in his face. As the crowd erupted, Davis ran back down court and pumping his fist.\n\n\"I put in a lot of work over my four years of college and put in a lot of work in basketball my whole life and honestly I believe every shot that I take is going in,\" said Davis, who made game-winning shots as a sophomore to beat Texas-San Antonio and Old Dominion.\n\nSanchez said the inbounds play was designed for Davis.\n\n\"He said he wanted to win it,\" Sanchez said of Davis. \"I said, 'You want to go win it. Well, go win it.'\"\n\nOklahoma State coach Mike Boynton was humble after the stunning loss, saying it was hard to tell if it was a flagrant foul.\n\n\"As I sit here right now I can't imagine that call being made at that time,\" Boynton said. \"But if it was a flagrant, it was a flagrant. It's a judgment. He went to the monitor and thought it was. It's an unfortunate thing to happen.\"\n\nBoynton said he did not receive an explanation for why they made the call.\n\nMalik Martin had 13 points and Dravon Mangum 12 for the 49ers (1-1).\n\nOklahoma State was led by 17 points from Cameron McGriff, who made six clutch free throws down the stretch. Thomas Dziagwa scored 15 points on five 3-pointers. Waters had 15 points and Isaac Likekele added 13 for the Cowboys (0-1).\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOklahoma State: Losing a 24-point lead is never good for a team's confidence and that is something that may cause issues for the Cowboys in close games down the stretch particular with such a young team. \"We played like a fairly immature team,\" Boynton said. \"We got a big lead and relaxed. And that's what happens. It's hard to win on the road. It really is. It was a concern of mine coming in playing six freshmen and no seniors.\"\n\nCharlotte: The 49ers had 18 turnovers in the first 30 minutes before settling down. They showed incredible heart coming back from 24 down to win. Freshman Cooper Robb didn't put up big numbers, but made some key plays for the 49ers. It's a big win for Sanchez, who was hired away from Virginia in the offseason.\n\nGUTSY WIN\n\nSanchez was thrilled with how his team hung in there and didn't get down emotionally after trailing by 24.\n\n\"Being good isn't pretty, it's not sexy,\" Sanchez said. \"You got to get dirty. When you don't feel like you have any more, you have to be willing to dig in. And they did. They didn't lay down. They just fought.\"\n\nTURNOVER CENTRAL\n\nCharlotte won despite turning the ball over 22 times, something Sanchez said needs to be corrected.\n\nCOLD FINISH\n\nOklahoma State missed 11 of its final 12 shots from the field, but McGriff did make six free throws in the closing minutes including two to put the Cowboys up by three with 4.2 seconds left.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOklahoma State: Hosts Texas-San Antonio on Wednesday.\n\nCharlotte: Hosts James Madison on Friday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Nick Potts/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 Undisputed world cruiserweight champion Oleksandr Usyk successfully defended his four belts and sent Tony Bellew into retirement by knocking out the British fighter in the eighth round in Manchester on Saturday.\n\nUsyk took control when he sent Bellew to the canvas by following up a straight right with a looping left. The referee got to a count of six before calling off the fight.\n\nIt was the Ukrainian boxer's 16th straight win as a professional and his first defense since becoming the unified champion in July. He could now move up to heavyweight \u2014 the level he won at which he won an Olympic gold medal in 2012 \u2014 and his promoter, Alexander Krassyuk, said in the ring Usyk could fight three-belt heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua.\n\n\"He's an exceptional champion,\" Bellew said. \"Anyone who faces him is in trouble. Only the very best and very biggest will beat him.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old Bellew, who had already said this would be his 34th and last fight, had the better of Usyk early in the fight as he picked his moment to counter with his powerful right jab and even showboated at times.\n\nBut Bellew began to get worn down by the sixth round, at the end of which the Liverpool native got caught with a big left hook on the bell as he dropped his gloves.\n\nUsyk backed Bellew onto the ropes in the seventh round and, with blood streaming from his nose, the challenger was wobbling just before he was knocked down midway through the eighth.\n\n\"I can't remember what round that was,\" Bellew said. \"I don't even remember half of the fight.\"\n\nBellew will be remembered as a loudmouth fighter who upset the odds to become world cruiserweight champion in 2016 and then went up to heavyweight to earn successive victories in a grudge match against fellow Briton David Haye.\n\nAs for Crimea-born Usyk, he has an even brighter future ahead of him. The southpaw has risen virtually untouched through the professional ranks since leaving his amateur days behind him after the London Olympics. Twelve of his 16 wins have come inside the distance. As an amateur, he was also a world and European champion.\n\nUsyk fought three times in 10 months in the World Boxing Super Series \u2014 beating Marco Huck, the then-WBC champion Mairis Briedis, and most recently Murat Gassiev in July \u2014 to become undisputed cruiserweight champion and has now seen off the third-ranked fighter in the division.\n\n\"I had the most difficult year in my life,\" Usyk said, in comments translated by Krassyuk. \"I want to relax and spend time with my family.

Rivers decided to stay with him in the closing seconds.\n\n\"These type of guys are different,\" Rivers said. \"They think every miss means they're closer to making 10 in a row.\"\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's running dunk tied it at 126 with a minute left.\n\nRookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander missed a pullup jumper for Los Angeles, but he blocked Eric Bledsoe's driving floater.

Danilo Gallinari's potential winning shot for Los Angeles missed at the buzzer, sending both teams to their first overtime of the season.\n\n\"I've got to do a better job of making better reads, especially down the stretch,\" Bledsoe said. \"Knowing when to attack, knowing when to pass. I was really indecisive.\"\n\nPatrick Beverley had 21 points for Los Angeles, and Harris finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nThe Clippers blew a 15-point lead early in the second. The Bucks fought back with seven 3-pointers \u2014 Brook Lopez hit four \u2014 and they outscored Los Angeles 37-20 to take a 64-62 lead into halftime.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nBucks: Lopez tied his career high with six 3-pointers. ... They have lost three in a row to the Clippers.\n\nClippers: Gallinari's consecutive free throw streak ended at 55 when he missed a technical foul shot in the third quarter. He came up just short of the franchise record of 58 set by Jamal Crawford in 2012. ...

He said he's more concerned about the affected residents than his own project. ... G Avery Bradley (left ankle sprain) missed his third straight game and F Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee) sat out his eighth in a row.\n\nMOMENT OF SILENCE\n\nThere was a moment of silence to remember the victims of the recent bar shootings in Thousand Oaks. Both teams wore black T-shirts with \"Enough\" on the front and the names of the 12 people shot to death on the back.\n\n\"There can only be so many prayers and thoughts that can go out,\" Harris said. \"Action has to be taken.\"\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\"We're a blacktop team.

(AP) \u2014 Crashes in consecutive weeks had backed Christopher Bell into a corner that jeopardized his strong rookie season in the Xfinity Series.\n\nBut Bell thrives in must-win moments, and Saturday at ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix was another example of the young driver delivering when everything was on the line. Bell won \u2014 the only result that would have advanced him into the championship round \u2014 and will now race for a second NASCAR national championship.\n\nBell won the Truck Series title last year, moved to the Xfinity Series this season in a Toyota from Joe Gibbs Racing, and his victory Saturday was a series-high seventh of the season. Had he not won, though, two weeks of bad luck would have wiped out his season.\n\n\"The pressure was on and I am just one of those guys who does really well in those situations,\" Bell said. \"Everything is on the line and I am just thankful I pulled through for my team. These guys are the ones who build the race cars that are going to win, whether I am driving them or not.\"\n\nThe Gibbs organization is indeed the most dominant in the Xfinity Series but was in danger of missing out on the title race at Homestead-Miami Speedway had Bell not won Saturday. Bell started the race seventh in the standings and the win gives him a chance to add more hardware to his decorated first season. Bell's seven wins are the most for an Xfinity regular since Dale Earnhardt Jr. also won seven times in 1998.\n\nThe championship four next Saturday are Bell, Cole Custer, Daniel Hemric and Tyler Reddick. The group represents all three manufacturers with a Ford driver, Toyota driver and two Chevrolet drivers, and come from four teams. Bell drives for Gibbs, Custer for Stewart-Haas Racing, Hemric for Richard Childress Racing and Reddick for JR Motorsports.\n\nWhile Reddick did move on to insure a JR Motorsports car will race for the title, the organization missed out with drivers Justin Allgaier and Elliott Sadler. Allgaier was the regular-season champion with five victories, but a late-race tire problem spoiled his finish and he dropped below the cutoff line.\n\nSadler, who was second in the standings at the start of the race, finished 11th and also dropped out of contention. The veteran is retiring after next week's finale and had hoped to close his NASCAR stint with a shot at the championship that has eluded him his entire career.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Jordan Naughton, a projected starter, hasn't played this season and is likely out for a month with a knee injury, according to the Casper Star-Tribune. His replacement in the lineup, Hunter Thompson, suffered a concussion after starting in Wyoming's season opening 76-66 loss to UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday.\n\nOregon State: The Beavers might have something in junior college transfer Kylor Kelley. After getting three blocks in the season opener, the 7-footer had four against Wyoming. He also had 12 points and eight rebounds. .Tinkle has a great all-around game, but has said he wants to improve his outside shooting this season. So far, so good. After going 2 for 4 on 3-pointers in the season opener, he shot 3 for 6 on Saturday.\n\nMATCHUP NIGHTMARE: Hollins had a dud of an opening night, scoring two points and grabbing one rebound. But he bounced back with aggressive play on Saturday. \"What Al is continuing to learn and understand is what a nightmare he is matchup wise. Bigger guys can't guard him on the perimeter, smaller guys can't guard him around the basket,\" Wayne Tinkle said.\n\nSCORING HELP: Wayne Tinkle said he knows the team is going to get scoring from his son and the Thompson brothers, \"But we have to get more than that.\" So it was huge for Hollins and Kelley to step up, he added.\n\nALL-AROUND TALENT: James has been told by Wyoming coaches and outside talent evaluators that he needs to do more than just score this season, and the senior has responded well, Edwards said. \"One assist away from a triple-double. That's unheard of in the college game,\" he added. \"We're a little banged up, but once everybody gets healthy, there are a little more veteran pieces to put around him so his game can flourish even more.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOregon State plays Old Dominion at the U.S. Virgin Islands Paradise Jam on Saturday.\n\nWyoming hosts Grambling on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Having already locked up a spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game, the Bulldogs (9-1, 7-1, No. 5 CFP) couldn't afford to slip up against the Tigers.\n\nThe Bulldogs trailed 10-6 with the first half winding down. But, facing third-and-4 from the Auburn 14 and the prospect of bringing on kicker Rodrigo Blankenship for the third time, Jake Fromm connected on a TD pass to Tyler Simmons that pushed the home team ahead with 2:47 remaining.\n\nAuburn (6-4, 3-4, No. 24 CFP) went three-and-out, taking only 47 seconds off the clock, and Georgia got a chance to add to its lead. Swift broke off a 24-yard run before two short completions left the Bulldogs facing fourth-and-3 at the Tigers 38.\n\nCoach Kirby Smart let the clock run down before calling timeout with 29 seconds remaining.

They took a safety that appeared intentional, giving Ohio State a 9-6 lead. The ensuing free kick went out of bounds, giving the Buckeyes the ball at the 50, and then Chrisman pinned Michigan State back again.\n\nOhio State capitalized on that punt when a shotgun snap by Michigan State hit the man in motion. Dre'Mont Jones recovered the fumble in the end zone, giving Ohio State a 16-6 advantage.\n\nNO. 9 LSU 24, ARKANSAS 17\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark.

(AP) \u2014 Sam Reinhart returned after getting his lip stitched up to lead the Buffalo Sabres in a comeback victory.\n\nReinhart tied it with 1:47 left in regulation, 40 seconds after he set up Jeff Skinner's goal, and Jack Eichel and Casey Mittelstadt scored in the shootout to lift the Sabres over the Vancouver Canucks 4-3 on Saturday.\n\n\"We always felt like we were in the game and that's something we've really changed this year,\" said Reinhart, who spent the latter half of the first period in the dressing room getting stitches in his upper lip.\n\nBuffalo has won all eight games this season in which Reinhart has a point, while going 1-6-2 when he has not gotten on the scoresheet.\n\n\"Reino played awesome,\" Eichel said. \"I thought this was one of the best games I've ever seen him play. He was dominant.\"\n\nEichel also went to the dressing room to get treated for an undisclosed injury midway through first period but returned eight minutes into the second.\n\nWith goalie Carter Hutton pulled for an extra attacker, Reinhart set up Skinner for his team-leading 12th goal with 2:27 left, then tied it when he put back a rebound from Rasmus Ristolainen's slap shot at the left edge of the crease.\n\nNathan Beaulieu also scored, and Ristolainen and Rasmus Dahlin each had two assists in the Sabres' second straight overtime win.\n\nHutton made 36 saves and stopped two shots in the shootout, including a final denial moments after Mittelstadt's go-ahead score.\n\n\"The resiliency in this group, that never-out-of-it attitude, the ability to continue to fight, it's tremendous,\" Eichel said.\n\nLoui Eriksson had a goal and an assist for the Canucks, who are 4-0-2 in their last six games.

Pettersson entered Saturday leading all rookies with 10 goals and 17 points. ... Buffalo traded D Taylor Fedun to Dallas for a conditional seventh-round pick in the 2020 draft. The pick is conditional on Fedun playing at least 25 regular season and playoff games for the Stars. Fedun has played with the Sabres' minor league club this season. ... Gudbranson extended his career-best point streak to five games. ... Sabres F Zemgus Girgensons was a healthy scratch for the first time this season.

They also promoted receiver Robert Foster from the practice squad and released linebacker Ramon Humber.\n\nBuffalo (2-7) has lost four straight and is off to its worst start since losing eight of its first nine games in 2010.\n\nThe game between the two AFC East teams will feature a matchup of backups rather than first-round picks.\n\nThe Jets (3-6) are starting 39-year-old Josh McCown with rookie Sam Darnold sidelined by a strained right foot. Darnold was drafted third overall, four spots ahead of Allen.\n\nBarkley is on his sixth team in six seasons since being selected by Philadelphia in the fourth round of the 2013 draft. He was most recently in Cincinnati before being cut by the Bengals in September after hurting his knee in a preseason game.\n\n\"It hasn't maybe been the plan I signed up for when I thought of going to the NFL,\" Barkley said of his pro career, which came after he set numerous school records as a four-year starter at Southern California. \"But from what I've been able to learn along the way, I think I'm in a great spot right now.\"\n\nOverall, Barkley has gone 159 for 266 for 1,911 yards passing with eight touchdowns and 18 interceptions in 11 NFL appearances.\n\nThat's much better than Peterman's production since being selected in the fifth round of the 2017 draft.\n\nPeterman has thrown seven interceptions in four appearances this season, including three in a 41-9 loss to Chicago last weekend. Overall, he's thrown 12 interceptions in eight appearances and is best remembered for getting picked off five times in the first half of a 54-24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers a year ago.\n\nThe Bills offense has struggled no matter who's started this season.\n\nBuffalo has scored a league-worst 96 points and just two touchdowns in its past four games. The quarterbacks have combined for just three touchdowns passing and 16 interceptions, including five by Allen.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I felt in control of my ball striking. I felt in control of driving, the iron play, the putting. It's been a great three days.\"\n\nKuchar saved par from just off the green at the 18th to keep his four-shot margin over Whee Kim, who had a 66.\n\nThe last time Kuchar had a four-shot lead going into the final round was the 2014 Houston Open, and he wound up losing in a playoff when Matt Jones made a 45-foot birdie putt on the last hole and then chipped in from 40 yards in a playoff.\n\nThe other two times Kuchar had the 54-hole lead, he won the Memorial in 2013 one week after losing a one-shot lead at Colonial.\n\n\"You know the deal, though. You have to go play good golf,\" Kuchar said. \"I can't go out there and think a whole bunch of pars are going to get me in the winner's circle. I've still got to make a good number of birdies, and with that, somewhat have the pedal down.\"\n\nRichy Werenski and Danny Lee each shot 67 and were five shots back, followed by a group that included PGA Tour rookie of the year Aaron Wise (63) and Cameron Champ (69). Champ, who played in the final group with Kuchar and Lee, already won this season at the Sanderson Farms Championship.\n\nKuchar has been piling up birdies at El Camaleon Golf Club, and he began to pull away with four birdies on the front nine. Just like Friday, however, one hole gave him stress. It was the 12th hole in the second round, when he had to make a 35-foot bogey putt. On Saturday, it was a tee shot on the 14th. Kuchar took a penalty from the hazard, and dropped in a good lie a few inches next to the cart path.\n\nInstead of taking relief into deeper rough, he hit with his feet on the path and picked it clean so his fairway metal wouldn't smack into the cement. It came up just short of the green, and he chipped to 5 feet and made the bogey putt.\n\nKuchar responded with a tee shot to 4 feet on the par-3 15th to restore his margin to four shots, and he caught a break on the last hole when he pulled his approach, but it struck a tree and came down in light rough to set up a simple up-and-down.\n\nChamp was trying to get into the final group for Sunday with a par on the last hole, but his wedge came out hot from the rough and rolled through the green, his chip came out heavy and he three-putted for double bogey.\n\nRyder Cup captain Jim Furyk had a 66 and was at 13-under 200. Also seven shots behind was Anirban Lahiri of India, who was tied with Kuchar early on the front line and still in the mix until a double bogey on the 14th hole and a bogey on the 16th. He had to settle for a 69.\n\nKuchar's last PGA Tour victory was at Hilton Head in 2014. He won the Fiji International with his dad caddying for him late in 2015, but struggled to contend this year and failed to reach the third FedEx Cup playoff event for the first time in nearly a decade. He also did not make the Ryder Cup team for the first time in 10 years.\n\n\"So 2018 has not been my best year, has not been a highlight for me, been a disappointing year,\" Kuchar said. \"But it's got signs now of righting the ship and turning into a great start to ... maybe it's a great finish to '18, great start to '18-19, however you want to classify the calendar.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Harvick's bid for a second NASCAR title suffered a massive setback when he was stripped of his berth in the championship race after series inspectors found his winning car from Texas Motor Speedway had been deliberately altered to give him a performance advantage. (AP Photo/Mary Schwalm, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The mood in the desert is tense headed into the final elimination race before NASCAR's championship, a title Kevin Harvick is determined to win.\n\nThe 2014 champion is on a mission to lead his Stewart-Haas Racing team into the title race, prove they honestly are the best group in the garage and that a wave of adversity cannot unravel their success . NASCAR said the No. 4 team cheated in last weekend's victory at Texas by building their own spoiler and passing it off as one supplied by the required vendor. The punishment was severe and put Harvick in danger of not qualifying for the championship.\n\nBut the road to the final four goes through ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix. It's a track where Harvick has won nine times previously, including this year \u2014 a week after a different No. 4 Ford was found to be illegal following a victory. This track was critical in Harvick's run to his first title four years ago when he had to win, and did, at Phoenix to advance to the championship round.\n\nA win isn't required Sunday, and Harvick needs only to avoid any on-track issues to secure his ticket at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nOnly a quiet Sunday drive is not Harvick's style.\n\nHe arrived in Phoenix without his crew chief and car chief, both suspended for the final two races of the season . The berth he'd earned into the final four by winning last week at Texas had been stripped away as punishment by NASCAR. His team has been branded a cheat.\n\nThe situation is less than ideal, and Harvick is disinterested in discussing the penalty or the plight of his race team. He's instead letting his performance speak for itself.\n\nHe went out and won the pole .\n\nThen he was fastest in both of Saturday's practices.\n\nIt's quite clear Harvick came to Arizona with every intention of rolling over the competition on his way to Homestead. The penalty is old news to him and he's not looking back.\n\n\"I show up and do the best that I can,\" Harvick said. \"The best thing that shows up are results on the race track. I drive and try to do the best that I can and we go from there.\"\n\nHe's one of seven drivers racing Sunday for three remaining spots in the finale. Only Joey Logano is locked in \u2014 and it is no coincidence he's the most relaxed playoff driver right now \u2014 and all three of Harvick's teammates are vying for slots. The penalty issued Wednesday against Harvick not only cost him his automatic berth to Homestead but the points deduction left him only three points above the cutline.\n\nLurking right behind him is teammate Kurt Busch, who recognized the opportunity Harvick's penalty opened for the last driver to win the Cup title in a Ford.\n\n\"This week with the penalty, it's like we won two stages without even firing up the engine on our car,\" said Busch, champion in 2004 in the first year of NASCAR's playoff system. \"Now we're equal and the job now is to get stage one, stage two and to see how things pan out for the end of the race. We know our job is going to be tough, but we just have to go after it.\"\n\nWhile Harvick was laying the groundwork for a rout on Sunday, his competition was preparing for an intense push for those final three berths.

Kyle Busch, Truex and Harvick were NASCAR's so-called Big Three this year as they dominated the regular season yet none are guaranteed to race for the title.\n\nSo it left Logano as the only relaxed driver and feeling mighty confident about his title chances.\n\n\"When the playoffs started, I kind of felt like we were an underdog,\" Logano said. \"The last six or seven weeks we've led a lot more laps, we've won a lot of stages, won a race, was fast at Kansas, was fast at Texas and you know what? I think we're the favorite now to win.\"\n\nLogano bumped Truex out of his way in the final turn at Martinsville Speedway two weeks ago to win the race and earn the automatic berth. Locking in allowed Logano to take a singular focus on Homestead.\n\n\"We're focused in on one race for the last two weeks, and other teams really have to focus in on getting there first,\" Logano said. \"Instead of working on just one car, they had to work on three cars to get in and then another one on top of that for Miami.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Duke won 42-35. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Daniel Jones kept Duke moving to big yardage totals, while the Blue Devils' defense provided help when the offense stumbled.\n\nThat has the Blue Devils keeping the Victory Bell after another rivalry win against North Carolina.\n\nJones accounted for a program-record 547 total yards and four touchdowns to help Duke beat UNC 42-35 on Saturday, earning the program's third straight win in the longtime series of nearby neighbors.\n\nJones threw for 361 yards and three touchdowns for the Blue Devils (7-3, 3-3 Atlantic Coast Conference). He also ran for a 61-yard touchdown and had a 68-yard keeper in a 186-yard rushing day, helping Duke finish with a season-high 629 yards.\n\nAnd there was no shortage of praise for the redshirt junior's performance.\n\n\"Daniel Jones played as well as a quarterback can play,\" said Duke coach David Cutcliffe, who has had a few notable pupils in his coaching career that includes a couple of guys named Peyton and Eli Manning.\n\n\"I know I'm not the fastest guy on the field,\" Jones said of his runs. \"I was trying to run as fast as I could. Both of those long runs, I'm not sure I really got touched, and I think that's a credit to those guys up front.\"\n\nJones' 547 yards of total offense were also the most ever allowed by UNC, surpassing the record of 525 yards set last year by reigning Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson of Louisville.\n\nAfter taking a 35-28 lead into the break following a shootout of a first half, Duke pushed to a two-possession lead when Jones' 68-yarder set up a short TD run by Quentin Harris. The Tar Heels (1-8, 1-6) got back in it with Nathan Elliott's 13-yard TD throw to Thomas Jackson with 75 seconds left.\n\nThen, after a late stop, UNC had a final drive for the tie and pushed to the Duke 39 with 6 seconds left. But Duke's Brandon Feamster ended it by knocking down the end-zone pass from Cade Fortin \u2014 a strong-armed freshman brought in for the final heave in his first appearance since being injured against Virginia Tech.\n\n\"We're throwing a jump ball to tie the game up,\" UNC coach Larry Fedora said. \"They're a good football team. Our guys continue to fight. There's no question about that, who they are and what they're made up of. I'm proud of them for that fact.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUNC: The Tar Heels had another uneven performance, the kind of fix-one-thing-and-something-else-breaks issues frequently seen this season. Michael Carter (148 yards and a TD) and the ground game couldn't be stopped before halftime while the defense struggled, only to reverse roles with the defense coming up with a blocked field goal and two takeaways after halftime as the offense went into a 28-minute slumber. UNC fought to the final play, but still ended with a 20th loss in 25 games.\n\n\"We're not just trying to get through it,\" Fedora said. \"We're trying to win a football game. I'm not worried about their morale. I'm not worried about what they're made up of. They've already shown that for us this entire year. They could've shut it down a long time ago.\"\n\nDuke: Jones grabbed the headlines with the total-offense record (set in 1988) and the biggest rushing day by a Duke quarterback (set in 1976). But the defense came up big, too, by turning the Tar Heels away repeatedly after halftime.\n\n\"The reason we were able to fight that off is the fight of our entire team,\" Cutcliffe said. \"There was no one part \u2014 offense, defense or kicking \u2014 that enabled us to win. It was every part that enabled us to win.\"\n\nINJURY NEWS\n\nDuke was already down several injured starters this year when starting safety Dylan Singleton limped off the field in the first quarter. Cutcliffe said he will have surgery Sunday without specifying the nature of the injury.\n\nKEEPING THE BELL\n\n\"There's just so much emotion in that rivalry, and especially toward the end it got a little closer than you'd like,\" Duke left guard Zach Harmon said. \"So it's just a huge payoff of relief at the end, it couldn't feel better.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUNC: The Tar Heels step out of league play to host Western Carolina next Saturday.\n\nDuke: The Blue Devils draw the toughest of cross-divisional matchups, traveling to No. 2 Clemson next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Fisher called a timeout just before the kick, which sailed wide right.\n\nThe Aggies pushed the lead to 10 points when Mond found Quartney Davis on a 5-yard touchdown pass with about five minutes left.\n\nOle Miss (5-5, 1-5) got within a touchdown when Logan made a 24-yard field goal with about two minutes remaining.\n\nAn onside kick was called by Ole Miss after that, but A&M recovered it and Williams ran 46 yards for a touchdown on the next play to put the game out of reach.\n\n\"They kept their poise and executed,\" Fisher said.\n\nAfter their recent struggles in the fourth quarter, the Aggies knew they couldn't let up after they got the lead late on Saturday.\n\n\"That was really our main focus ... instead of just focusing on winning we wanted to dominate,\" Mond said.\n\nJordan Ta'amu threw for 373 yards and a touchdown for the Rebels, who lost their third straight game and have won just one conference game. A.J. Brown had 127 yards receiving and DaMarkus Lodge added 122 yards receiving with a touchdown.\n\n\"We couldn't get to a rhythm offensively; give those guys credit, they made the plays that we didn't,\" Ole Miss coach Matt Luke said.\n\nWilliams had 31 carries for 228 yards in his second 200-yard game this season to give him 1,159 this season.\n\nWillie Hibbler knocked the ball out of Mond's hands on the first series of the second half and Zedrick Woods scooped it up and rumbled 96 yards for a touchdown to make it 21-14.\n\nMond was intercepted by Ken Webster on Texas A&M's next drive, but the Rebels couldn't move the ball and punted it back.\n\nThe Aggies finally put together a clean drive after that, driving 72 yards in nine plays capped by a 10-yard touchdown reception by Davis to tie it at 21-21.\n\nTexas A&M led 7-0 when Ole Miss tied it on the first play of the second quarter when Ta'amu connected with Lodge on a 44-yard TD pass.\n\nThe Rebels took a 14-7 lead when Ta'amu scored on a 1-yard run later in the second\n\nLodge made a 51-yard reception with less than five minutes left in the second quarter. But Ta'amu fumbled two plays later and the Aggies recovered to get one more possession before halftime.\n\n\"We had a big turnover in the red zone and had a chance to put us up 10 right there; that was big in the first half,\" Luke said.\n\nTexas A&M took advantage of the miscue when Camron Buckley scored on a 21-yard reception that left it tied at 14-all at halftime.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMississippi: With just two games left the Rebels will have to figure out a way to win a conference game if they hope to become bowl eligible.\n\nTexas A&M: The Aggies moved the ball well at times, but Mond will need to take better care of the ball after committing four turnovers in the last two weeks for Texas A&M to finish the season strong.\n\nMILLER RETURNS\n\nFormer Texas A&M star and current Denver Bronco Von Miller was honored during a break in the second quarter. Highlights of the outside linebacker's career with the Aggies were played on the Jumbotron before he was introduced and received a loud ovation from the crowd.\n\nMiller, whose Broncos have a bye on Sunday, played at Texas A&M from 2007-10 and was named MVP of the Super Bowl in the 2015 when he helped the Broncos beat the Panthers 24-10.\n\nRECORD-SETTER\n\nBrown became the school's all-time leading receiver with his performance on Saturday.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) \u2014 When Missouri kicker Tucker McCann missed a 31-yard field goal to the left with 1:48 remaining in the game, the possibility opened up that Missouri could lose its third last-second contest of the season.\n\nThe Tigers were up 33-28. Quarterback Kyle Shurmur led Vanderbilt 55 yards down the field, setting up for a play on Missouri's 25-yard line with five seconds remaining.\n\nWhen the final pass came down untouched, Missouri had won its sixth game, becoming bowl-eligible for the second season in a row. The Tigers exhaled.\n\n\"I instantly just fell down on my knees and said 'thank you God',\" Missouri running back Damarea Crockett said.\n\nMissouri's defense bent but didn't break during Vanderbilt's final drive.\n\n\"I was wishing it was over before then,\" Missouri head coach Barry Odom said. \"But I had trust in what was called. I'm proud that our team ended up winning it on that last play.\"\n\nIn the end, the Tigers (6-4, 2-4 Southeastern Conference) are going bowling, and the Commodores (4-6, 1-5) will need to win both its remaining games to guarantee bowl eligibility.\n\nVanderbilt had led all game until Missouri running backs Crockett and Larry Rountree III fueled a 99-yard drive to start the fourth quarter. The drive started after Vanderbilt failed to convert a 4th-and-goal opportunity on Missouri's 1-yard line.\n\n\"Not putting the ball in the end zone on fourth-and-1 was the most critical play in the ballgame for us,\" Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \"Not getting that done cost us momentum.\"\n\nFrom there, the Tigers trekked down the field for a 14-play drive that lasted 5:38. Quarterback Drew Lock trotted three yards into the end zone to give Missouri its first lead of the game - 33-28 with 9:18 remaining.\n\nShurmur outplayed Lock for the majority of the game, with 249 yards and three touchdowns on 24-for-35 passing. Lock, a former Heisman hopeful, passed for 253 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions on 22-for-33 passing.\n\nCrockett bolted for 122 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries and Rountree added 92 yards on 21 rushes.\n\n\"Those guys put the game on their back,\" Lock said. \"Our o-line blocked their butts off.\"\n\nVanderbilt's Ke'Shawn Vaughn ran for 182 yards and one touchdown on 15 carries, good for 12.1 yards per carry.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVanderbilt: The Commodores showed promise on offense in the first half and proved that they could compete on the road. The victory would have immensely helped the team's bowl chances, but Vanderbilt can still clinch eligibility with wins in home games against Ole Miss and Tennessee.\n\nMissouri: It wasn't as pretty as the Tigers' 38-17 victory over No. 13 Florida, but Missouri is officially going bowling. After a rough first half, the defense locked down and offense stepped up in the second half. Finally winning a close game should help the Tigers' spirits.\n\nFOURTH QUARTER FUTILITY\n\nBeginning with the failed fourth-and-goal attempt from the 1-yard line, Vanderbilt missed out on multiple opportunities in the fourth quarter. Vanderbilt was flagged on an unsportsmanlike conduct, which turned a 3rd-and-1 to a 3rd-and-16, which it didn't convert.\n\nThe Commodores picked off Lock on the ensuing drive, putting themselves on Missouri's 35. They managed just one yard on four plays.\n\n\"It's been the same story all season,\" said Vanderbilt tight end Jared Pinkney, who had five catches for 88 yards. \"We can't finish, for whatever reason.\"\n\nON THE RIGHT SIDE\n\nMissouri has lost a pair of last-second contests this season, 37-35 to South Carolina and 15-14 against No. 12 Kentucky. After winning on a last-second play, Odom and his players acknowledged how much better it feels to be on the good side of thrillers.\n\n\"Down to the last play, I'm kind of tired of those,\" Odom said. \"Excited for our team to show the resolve, the toughness and the grit when it wasn't very pretty early on.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVanderbilt returns home to play Ole Miss.\n\nMissouri goes on the road to face Tennessee.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP-Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Drue Chrisman's first punt of the day was an embarrassment, a 4-yarder at the end of Ohio State's first possession.\n\n\"I don't know where it ranks in Ohio State's worst punts in history, but it was definitely my worst punt,\" Chrisman said. \"I was just like, 'Man, I've got to ball after this one.'\"\n\nChrisman made up for that early blooper, keeping Michigan State pinned back with a sensational second half of punting. Eighth-ranked Ohio State pulled away for a 26-6 victory over the 24th-ranked Spartans on Saturday, largely because of what Chrisman did to Michigan State's field position.\n\nIn a tight defensive struggle, Chrisman's punts forced Michigan State (6-4, 4-3 Big Ten, No. 18 CFP) to start its first five drives after halftime from its own 5, 6, 3, 1 and 2-yard line. On the fourth of those possessions, the Spartans took an intentional safety instead of punting out of their own end zone. That decision gave Ohio State a 9-6 lead but wasn't enough to flip the field position.\n\nThe ensuing free kick went out of bounds, giving the Buckeyes the ball at the 50, and then Chrisman pinned Michigan State back again. Ohio State (9-1, 6-1, No. 10) capitalized on that punt when a shotgun snap by Michigan State hit the man in motion. Dre'Mont Jones recovered the fumble for the Buckeyes in the end zone, giving Ohio State a 16-6 advantage.\n\n\"We just kept playing the field-position game,\" Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer said. \"We always talk about the offense's job in a game like this \u2014 get two first downs, get the ball to midfield and let's get the ball down inside the 10-yard line.\"\n\nBoth offenses found the going tough. Michigan State was 2 for 16 on third down. The Spartans used both Brian Lewerke and Rocky Lombardi at quarterback but never reached the end zone.\n\n\"It's not easy to call plays off the goal line,\" Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said.\n\nChrisman's day began with his 4-yard punt, but Michigan State couldn't take advantage.\n\n\"I almost benched him, but I didn't have anybody else to go with,\" Meyer said.\n\nOhio State opened the scoring late in the second quarter on a 1-yard pass from Dwayne Haskins to Parris Campbell. It was 7-3 at halftime.\n\nThe Spartans had a third-quarter touchdown called back for a penalty. They settled for a field goal on that drive to make it 7-6, but that was as close as they got.\n\nMichigan State has dealt with significant injury problems at the punter position this year, and that was a factor in Dantonio's decision to take the safety . The Spartans were soon right back against their own goal line. That was when the fumble on the snap turned the game in Ohio State's favor for good.\n\n\"Sent the motion a little early,\" Lombardi said. \"We just didn't connect on it. ... I've got to fix it.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOhio State: This was likely the Buckeyes' toughest remaining challenge before a late-November showdown with Michigan. Ohio State remains very much in contention for the Big Ten title after shutting down Michigan State's offense and winning the special teams battle. The Buckeyes have won seven straight road games in this series.\n\nMichigan State: Lombardi appeared to give the Spartans a spark late in the first half, but Michigan State's offense couldn't sustain any momentum, thanks in part to all the bad field position. The Spartans' top-ranked run defense looked the part, but they weren't able to move the ball well enough.\n\nSTAREDOWN\n\nIn the final minute of the first half, Michigan State lined up as if to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the Ohio State 26. Then the Spartans called a timeout.\n\nThen the Buckeyes called one. Then Ohio State called another.\n\nThen Michigan State took a timeout.\n\nThe Spartans finally gave in and kicked a field goal.\n\nMOVING UP\n\nHaskins threw for only 227 yards, but that was enough to move him ahead of J.T. Barrett and past Bobby Hoying on the school's single-season list. Joe Germaine, who passed for 3,330 yards in 1998, tops the list but is only 50 ahead of Haskins.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nMichigan State will likely drop out of the Top 25, while Ohio State can hope a solid win on the road will impress the voters and the playoff committee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOhio State: The Buckeyes face Maryland next Saturday in their final road game of the season.\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans also play their last road game, at Nebraska.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Nebraska won 54-35. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Nebraska's high-powered offense made Illinois pay for its many mistakes Saturday.\n\nThe Cornhuskers converted four of the Illini's five turnovers into 24 points while pulling away for a 54-35 win, their third in four games after an 0-6 start.\n\n\"We got some good breaks today. We were probably due for some good breaks,\" Nebraska first-year coach Scott Frost said. \"They made a couple mistakes and got us some good situations. You can't take advantage of those if you're not doing the right thing.\"\n\nThe Huskers (3-7, 2-5 Big Ten) did plenty right. Wearing alternate uniforms to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, the Huskers rolled up 606 total yards on a raw afternoon when the wind chill dipped to 13 degrees. Illinois amassed 509 yards in the meeting of the Big Ten's worst defenses.\n\n\"There early on in the game, watching our offense executing, man, it's fun calling plays; it was a thing of beauty,\" Frost said. \"Those guys were executing everything we were calling.\"\n\nAdrian Martinez threw for 290 yards and accounted for four touchdowns and Devine Ozigbo ran for 162 yards and three scores.\n\nIllinois (4-6, 2-5) had three turnovers in the first half \u2014 two muffed punts and a fumble by quarterback AJ Bush. Those led to 17 points for Nebraska, which led 38-21 at half.\n\nBush moved the Illini into Nebraska territory on the opening series of the second half but was intercepted when his pass went through Dominic Stampley's hands into safety Aaron Williams'. The Huskers embarked on a 17-play, 82-yard drive that chewed nearly 8 minutes off the clock, with Ozigbo scoring his second touchdown for a 24-point lead.\n\n\"When you turn the ball over like that, it's tough to win,\" Illini coach Lovie Smith said. \"When you continue to give up big runs on the defensive side of the football, run and pass, it's tough duty. When you have a couple mishaps like we did in the special teams game against a team like this at home, it's tough to win.\"\n\nMartinez was 24 of 34 and threw for three touchdowns, and he ran 13 times for 55 yards and a TD. His 345 yards of total offense pushed his season total to a school freshman-record 2,747.\n\nOzigbo broke a career-long 66-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and went 60 yards for another TD in the fourth.\n\nBush, playing against the school where he spent the first two years of his college career, threw for 126 yards but was intercepted twice. Nebraska couldn't stop Bush as a runner, though. He rushed for a school quarterback-record 187 yards and three touchdowns on 25 carries.\n\n\"It's cool, but I didn't get the most important stat I wanted,\" Bush said. \"You ball out, but LeBron scores 60 and they lose. It's like that.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIllinois: Five turnovers can't be overcome when the defense has no answer for an offense that's rolling like Nebraska's. It was the second straight week the Illini have had three or more turnovers and third time in four games.\n\nNebraska: The Huskers have scored at least 30 points in five straight games, including four straight in conference play for the first time since 2001, and have gone over 450 yards of total offense in seven straight games for the first time in program history. They're averaging 537.9 yards over those seven games.\n\n\"I firmly believe we can move the ball on anybody,\" Ozigbo said, \"and we should score every drive.\"\n\nNUMBERS TO NOTE\n\nOzigbo is 42 yards short of becoming the Huskers' first 1,000-yard rusher since 2014. ...

(AP Photo/Chris Knight) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Trace McSorley and Penn State went back to a familiar formula Saturday \u2014 a steady diet of elusive Miles Sanders.\n\nThe resurgent running game put the Nittany Lions offense back on track, and got McSorley a milestone victory, too.\n\nSanders ran for 159 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries, McSorley matched Todd Blackledge's program record with his 29th win at quarterback and No. 21 Penn State beat Wisconsin 22-10.\n\nIf Sanders had been irritated that his rushing totals had fallen off along with the Nittany Lions' offensive output lately, he hadn't shown it. He considers himself a patient tailback, and he channeled some pent-up energy into running over the Badgers.\n\n\"People may say that at times (Sanders) had been frustrated, but you never saw that,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said. \"Would we love to rush for more yards week in and week out? No doubt about it.\"\n\nPenn State (7-3, 4-3 Big Ten, No. 20 CFP) racked up 200-plus rushing yards in each of the first six games but had averaged just 120 over the last three. Meanwhile, McSorley \u2014 a key part of the team's rushing attack \u2014 has been dealing with a sore right knee.\n\nMcSorley completed 19 of 25 passes for 160 yards and a TD. He appeared to hurt his left knee in the first half but got some relief watching Sanders juke through the Badgers with his shifty running style.\n\n\"Something that I don't think he gets enough credit for is the balance he has,\" McSorley said. \"He's able to take on a hit and shake it off, maintain his balance and keep going.\"\n\nThe Badgers had no balance with starting quarterback Alex Hornibrook out with a concussion.\n\nJonathan Taylor ran 20 times for 185 yards and a touchdown for Wisconsin (6-4, 4-3), but backup quarterback Jack Coan completed just 9 of 20 passes for 60 yards with two interceptions and was sacked five times. The Badgers have lost three of their last five games.\n\n\"We've got to execute better,\" Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst said. \"We knew coming in, it's a good defense.\"\n\nDeAndre Thompkins caught a touchdown pass for Penn State, and the Nittany Lions held the Badgers to 125 yards in the second half.\n\nJake Pinegar made three field goals for Penn State while Wisconsin kicker Rafael Gaglianone added the Badgers final points midway through the third quarter.\n\nWisconsin broke through first when Taylor ran 71 yards to the end zone on the Badgers' first possession.\n\nBut McSorley led back-to-back scoring drives to give the Nittany Lions the lead for good. He hit Thompkins for a 14-yard touchdown pass to cap an eight-play drive, then led the offense just past midfield to set up Pinegar's 49-yard field goal.\n\nSanders added a 1-yard touchdown run midway through the second.\n\nPRESSURE GALORE\n\nBeaver Stadium was more difficult than usual for a quarterback to make his first career road start Saturday. Freezing temperatures were made worse by a constant wind powered by gusts up to 40 miles per hour.\n\nAt times, it looked like Penn State's defensive line was playing that fast. Shareef Miller and Wisconsin native Robert Windsor each turned in two sacks, and Coan was hurried or hit a handful of times.\n\nYOUNG WIDEOUTS\n\nThe Nittany Lions have been looking for more options in the passing game all season. Aside from KJ Hamler, who was targeted on six of Penn State's first 12 plays, another consistent playmaker has yet to emerge.\n\nBut a handful of underclassmen saw their most extended playing time yet. Jahan Dotson, Cam Sullivan-Brown and Justin Shorter combined to play season-high snap counts and contributed a combined four catches for 51 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWisconsin: The Badgers were limited on offense without Hornibrook. Coan attempted just four passes in the first half and completed two for 10 yards. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions were able to load up the box and keep Taylor from getting into the end zone following his first big run.\n\nPenn State: Offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne stuck with the running game and fed Sanders the ball, going back to what worked for Penn State earlier in the season as McSorley deals with a sore knee. The offensive line was solid, and the strategy worked well. It was Sanders' first 100-yard rushing game since Oct. 13.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWisconsin travels to Purdue.\n\nPenn State visits Rutgers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It's why we're winning,\" West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen said. \"You're only as good as your next one, so these guys have to continue doing that.\"\n\nFour of West Virginia's six touchdown drives took less than 1:30.\n\n\"When we get going, we're dangerous,\" West Virginia tight end Travon Wesco said. \"We've got to come out like that and know that we have to have that mentality every time we touch the ball.\"\n\nTCU (4-6, 2-5) was held to a season-low 222 yards of offense, the third time in four games it's gained fewer than 300. The Horned Frogs are in jeopardy of missing a bowl for just the third time under Patterson.\n\n\"We've been on the other side of these many times,\" Patterson said. \"You've got to find a way to score points and you've got to find a way to stop people.\"\n\nIt also marked the fewest yards allowed this season by West Virginia, who allowed 520 yards in a win at Texas a week ago.\n\nTCU's Mike Collins had some success throwing to sophomore Jalen Reagor, but not much else worked. Collins completed 22 of 37 passes for 229 yards. Reagor had a career-high 11 receptions for 150 yards. His 28-yard scoring catch gave him a TD in five straight games.\n\nCollins also was flagged for intentional grounding in the end zone in the third quarter and West Virginia was awarded a safety.\n\n\"We're not good enough right now to make up for mistakes,\" Patterson said.\n\nGrier followed that by finding Marcus Simms with a 53-yard pass to set up Kennedy McKoy's 1-yard scoring run for a 33-3 lead.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTCU: The Horned Frogs must win their final two games to become bowl eligible. Not impossible, but TCU must find the resolve to finish out a challenging season.\n\nWest Virginia: Grier didn't get a ton of opportunities to throw downfield, relying on a diet of short- to medium-length passes and completed 10 of them to his tight ends and running backs. Wesco finished with five catches for a team-high 86 yards, including a 32-yard score.\n\nHE'S NO. 2\n\nHolgorsen moved into second place in school history with 61 wins, one ahead of Rich Rodriguez. Hall of Famer Don Nehlen holds the mark with 149 wins.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe effort will be good enough to move West Virginia up in the AP Top 25 if a higher-ranked team loses.\n\nUNBEATEN AT HOME\n\nWest Virginia improved to 5-0 at home with the Nov. 23 regular-season finale remaining against Oklahoma. The last time the Mountaineers went unbeaten at home in a season was in 2009.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTCU plays at Baylor next Saturday.\n\nWest Virginia plays at Oklahoma State next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Feleipe Franks placed his index finger across his lips after both touchdown runs, sending a message to a home crowd that booed him earlier.\n\nAfter the second one, there was nothing Franks could have done to silence the Florida faithful.\n\nFranks accounted for three touchdowns, including the go-ahead score with a little more than four minutes remaining, and the 19th-ranked Gators rallied to beat South Carolina 35-31 Saturday and end a two-game losing streak.\n\n\"I'm a super emotional player,\" Franks said. \"That what makes it a two-way street. Lots of people are going to like me and lots of people aren't going to like me. Maybe that's something I shouldn't have did. But at the same time, I'm an emotional player. I want to win as much as anybody in the world. I'm an emotional guy. That's the way I play my game. I do apologize for that.\"\n\nFranks dived across the goal line on fourth down from inside the 1-yard line to put the Gators (7-3, 5-3 Southeastern Conference, No. 15 CFP) ahead for the first time all day and for good.\n\nCoach Dan Mullen said he didn't hesitate to go for it even though a short field goal would have tied the game. The Gators overcame a 17-point deficit in the second half to prevent former Florida coach and current South Carolina coach Will Muschamp from getting a win in his second trip back to Gainesville.\n\nC.J. Henderson sealed the victory when he intercepted Jake Bentley's third-down pass on the ensuing drive. Muschamp has dropped eighth of his last 10 games in the Swamp.\n\n\"It's a hard, tough loss,\" said Muschamp, who is 0-2 against his former team in Gainesville. \"We had our opportunities. Give Florida credit. They made plays they had to at the end. ... When you go on the road in our league and have the opportunities in front of us, to lose the game, it's gut-wrenching.\"\n\nFranks completed 15 of 21 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 36 yards and two scores a week after getting benched for the third time in two seasons.\n\nMullen opened up the quarterback competition during the week, but backup Kyle Trask broke a foot in practice Wednesday and is out for the remainder of the regular season. That left Franks as Mullen's only viable option against the Gamecocks (5-4, 4-4).\n\nStill, the home crowd turned on Franks quickly Saturday by booing him after consecutive plays on the first series in which he fumbled and badly overthrew a receiver.\n\nFranks responded after his first TD run.\n\n\"He's an emotional kid,\" Mullen said. \"I told him he's going to get booed. ... I also told him don't worry about anything that's not going to help us win the football game. Score a touchdown and get off the sidelines so we can coach you.\"\n\nSouth Carolina (5-4, 4-4) scored touchdowns on its first two possessions and looked like it would roll on the road \u2014 much like Missouri did last week. Jake Bentley had TD passes to end both drives, but did little down the stretch.\n\nBut Franks and the Gators responded.\n\nThe Gators ended up with 367 yards rushing. Jordan Scarlett had 159 yards on the ground. Lamical Perine added 107 yards and two scores. Dynamic receiver Kadarius Toney chipped in 51 yards on four carries.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSouth Carolina: After being up 17 points late in the third quarter, the Gamecocks found themselves in another nail-biter late. It was the team's fifth consecutive game decided by four points or less. They are 3-2 in those.\n\nFlorida: The Gators still have hopes of making a big-time bowl game and reaching 10 wins for just the second time in the last six seasons.\n\nMUSCHAMP CONNECTION\n\nAlthough Muschamp will forever be tied to Florida, he won't have many connections to his former school after this game.\n\nThe Gators have six fifth-year seniors who signed with Florida before Muschamp's final season in 2014. Florida also has one more payment to Muschamp to fulfill his severance, a $787,500 deposit later this month. That will complete his $6.3 million buyout.\n\nMISSING MEN\n\nFlorida was without three key players: guard Brett Heggie, safety Brad Stewart and receiver Freddie Swain. Heggie and Swain were injured last week against Missouri. Stewart has missed two of the last three games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouth Carolina hosts Chattanooga of the FCS, a welcome break after eight consecutive conference games.\n\nFlorida concludes a three-game homestand against Idaho, also an FCS team.

(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 No. 11 UCF is becoming predictable as the Knights pursue another undefeated season.\n\nThe defending American Athletic Conference champions keep on winning while insisting they aren't listening to chatter about whether they will be deserving of a berth in the College Football Playoff if they remain unbeaten when the four-team field is picked in December.\n\nNow, coach Josh Heupel and his players say they're turning their focus to No. 25 Cincinnati, which comes to Florida next week for a crucial AAC test.\n\nA victory over the Bearcats will clinch a spot in the conference championship game.\n\n\"At the end of the day, if you're doing it right inside of your program, each game becomes bigger,\" Heupel said Saturday after McKenzie Milton threw for two touchdowns and ran for a third to key a 35-24 victory over Navy that extended the nation's longest winning streak to 22 games.\n\n\"That's what we want. That's the type of program we're trying to build,\" Heupel added. \"I have great respect for Cincinnati. We're going to enjoy this one today and move on to Cincinnati tomorrow.\"\n\nUCF (9-0, 6-0) finished as the only unbeaten team in the Football Bowl Subdivision a year ago, but was not included in the CFP. The Knights currently are one of four FBS teams that remain undefeated, along with the top three teams in the latest CFP rankings \u2014 Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame.\n\nAlthough Heupel reiterated the Knights are only concerned with trying to go \"1-0 every week,\" the first-year coach said he's growing tired of playoff talk.\n\n\"No, we want to be in that conversation. We want to be in it every single year,\" Heupel said. \"We're building this program to have sustained success.\"\n\nMilton completed 17 of 21 passes for 200 yards without an interception for the Knights, who've scored at least 30 points in every game throughout its long winning streak.\n\nDredrick Snelson scored on receptions of 34 and 12 yards, Greg McCrae ran for 101 yards and one TD, and the Knights finished with 297 yards rushing to stay atop the AAC East Division standings\n\nThe Knights are 12th in the latest CFP rankings. Beating Navy (2-8, 1-5), which has lost seven straight games, won't exactly silence critics who feel the defending AAC champions are undeserving of a higher ranking because of the strength of their schedule.\n\n\"Obviously, it's (disappointing) to lose again,\" Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \"That's a really good team, though. They have won a ton of games. ... There's no consolation prizes for coming close, but I was proud of the way our guys fought.\"\n\nTRIPLE OPTION\n\nA week after being limited to a season-low 124 yards rushing in a 42-0 road loss at Cincinnati, Navy got one of the nation's most productive running attacks back on track. The Midshipmen rolled up 374 yards total offense, all of its rushing.\n\nQuarterback Zach Abey scored on runs of 5 and 8 yards, finishing with a team-best 85 yards rushing on 26 carries for Navy. He attempted two passes, both incompletions and was sacked once trying to throw.\n\nTre Walker ran for 82 yards on seven attempts, and Mike Martin ran for 51 and a fourth-quarter TD.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen finished a three-week stretch in which they lost to Notre Dame, Cincinnati and UCF, who were a combined 25-1 entering Saturday. Their chances of slowing UCF's potent offense hinged on getting its own running game going and dominating time of possession to keep Milton off the field.\n\nUCF: Milton was sharp in his second game since sitting out a road win over East Carolina with an undisclosed injury. The junior from Kapolei, Hawaii, hit 10 of his first 11 passes for 106 yards, completing throws to seven different receivers. He has at least one TD pass in 22 consecutive games.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Knights dropped two spots in the Top 25 after yielding 670 yards and 40 points in a 12-point home victory over heavy underdog Temple. They don't figure to earn any style points this week, either, after allowing the Midshipmen to hang around until the fourth quarter.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nNavy: Home vs. Tulsa, Saturday.\n\nUCF: Hosts No. 25 Cincinnati in key AAC matchup, Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA widely anticipated study has concluded that neither vitamin D nor fish oil supplements prevent cancer or serious heart-related problems in healthy older people, according to research presented Saturday at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions.\n\nResearchers defined serious heart problems as the combined rate of heart attacks, stroke and heart-related deaths.\n\nAlthough hundreds of studies of these supplements have been published over the years, the new clinical trial \u2013 a federally funded project involving nearly 26,000 people \u2013 is the strongest and most definitive examination yet, said Dr. Clifford Rosen, a senior scientist at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute who was not involved in the research.\n\nDoctors have been keenly interested in learning the supplements\u2019 true value, given their tremendous popularity with patients.\n\nTwenty-six percent of Americans age 60 and older take vitamin D supplements, according to a 2017 study. Twenty-two percent take pills containing omega-3 fatty acids, a key ingredient in fish oil.\n\nThe new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, also suggests there\u2019s no reason for people to undergo routine blood tests for vitamin D, said Rosen, who co-wrote an accompanying editorial.\n\nThat\u2019s because the study found that patients\u2019 vitamin D levels made no difference in their risk of cancer or serious heart issues, Rosen said.\n\nEven people who began the study with clear vitamin D deficiency got no benefit from taking supplements of 2,000 international units a day, equal to one or two of the vitamin D pills typically sold in stores.\n\nVitamin D testing has become a huge business for commercial labs \u2013 and an enormous expense for taxpayers. Doctors ordered more than 10 million vitamin D tests for Medicare patients in 2016 \u2013 an increase of 547 percent since 2007 \u2013 at a cost of $365 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop\u201d vitamin D testing, Rosen said. \u201cThere\u2019s no justification.\u201d\n\nMore: Vitamin D: The sunshine hormone\n\nMore: Power up your vitamin D source now that summer sun is here\n\nMore: Vitamin D deficiency tied to miscarriages, study says\n\nDr. JoAnn Manson, the study\u2019s lead author, agrees that her results don\u2019t support screening healthy people for vitamin D deficiency. But she doesn\u2019t see her study as entirely negative.\n\nManson notes that her team found no serious side effects from taking either fish oil or vitamin D supplements.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already taking fish oil or vitamin D, our results would not provide a clear reason to stop,\u201d Manson said.\n\nManson notes that a deeper look into the data suggested possible benefits.\n\nWhen researchers singled out heart attacks \u2013 rather than the rate of all serious heart problems combined \u2013 they saw that fish oil appeared to reduce heart attacks by 28 percent, Manson said.\n\nAs for vitamin D, it appeared to reduce cancer deaths \u2013 although not cancer diagnoses \u2013 by 25 percent.\n\nBut slicing the data into smaller segments \u2013 with fewer patients in each group \u2013 can produce unreliable results, said Dr. Barnett Kramer, director of the cancer prevention division at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe apparent links between fish oil and heart attacks \u2013 and vitamin D and cancer death \u2013 could be due to chance, Kramer said.\n\nExperts agree that vitamin D is important for bone health. Researchers in these papers didn\u2019t report on its effect on bones in these papers. Instead, they looked at areas where vitamin D\u2019s benefits haven\u2019t been proved, such as cancer and heart disease.\n\nPreliminary studies have suggested vitamin D can prevent heart disease and cancer, but more rigorous studies have disputed those findings.\n\nManson and her colleagues plan to publish data on the supplements\u2019 effects on other areas of health, including diabetes, memory and mental functioning, autoimmune disease, respiratory infections and depression, in coming months.\n\nConsumers who want to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease can follow other proven strategies.\n\n\u201cPeople should continue to focus on known factors to reduce cancer and heart disease: Eat right, exercise, don\u2019t smoke, control high blood pressure, take a statin if you are high risk,\u201d said Dr. Alex Krist, a professor of family medicine and population health at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

(AP) \u2014 Still perfect at home, not so perfect on the field. Army coach Jeff Monken will take it \u2014 grudgingly.\n\nDarnell Woolfolk rushed for 69 yards and two touchdowns, Calen Holt and Kelvin Hopkins Jr. each scored on short runs, and Army beat Lafayette 31-13 on a windswept Saturday.\n\nIt was the sixth straight victory for Army (8-2), which has won 12 in a row at home. Lafayette (3-7), which plays in the Championship Subdivision, fell behind early and was doomed by a blocked punt to start the second half.\n\n\"I challenged our team this week to try and play our very best football, to play the best that we can play,\" Monken said. \"At this point in the season we really need to be doing that if we're going to accomplish the goals that we've still got out there. I don't think we did that today, but it was good enough to win. We made some plays.\"\n\nArmy dominated the opening half, running twice as many plays as the Leopards, outgaining them 256-63, and holding the ball for nearly 22 minutes to gain a 17-6 lead. The margin could have been greater if not for a turnover and two false start penalties in a three-play sequence with the ball inside the Lafayette 10 that forced Army to kick a field goal on the game's first drive.\n\n\"Our mentality is every game we play is the hardest game we have,\" Woolfolk said. \"We knew that we couldn't get complacent. The talk around, 'Oh, you guys are playing an FCS team.' We just had to come out and execute, be perfect on our fundamentals. We were off and on on that.\n\n\"If we want to be the team that we want to be, we have to be perfect every drive, cap every drive off with a touchdown. Our team is capable of that. We need to meet our standards and be that team we all want to be.\"\n\nThe Leopards' loss was sealed after a blocked punt on the first possession of the second half. Jacob Bissell's rugby-style kick slammed off the helmet of Army's Andy Davidson and Mike Reynolds recovered for the Black Knights at the Lafayette 1 to set up Woolfolk's second TD. It was his 34th rushing touchdown, fifth all-time at Army and one more than Carlton Jones.\n\n\"It gives them an easy score,\" Lafayette coach John Garrett said. \"It was an impactful play in the game, unfortunately in their favor.\"\n\nThe Leopards tied it late in the first, taking advantage of an Army gaffe. Lafayette generated nothing on its first possession, punting after three downs. But Reynolds fumbled the kick after it bounced once and Lafayette's Yasir Thomas recovered at the Army 23. After losing 2 yards in three plays, Jeffrey Kordenbrock kicked a 42-yard field goal.\n\n\"We just fought until the end,\" said Lafayette running back Mike Dunn. \"We made them earn every yard.\"\n\nThe Black Knights scored their first touchdown early in the second. Hopkins hit a wide-open Glen Coates along the right side, and he broke a tackle and bulled his way to the Lafayette 1 for a 35-yard gain, a career best. Woolfolk scored on the next play for a 10-3 lead.\n\nAnother nice punt by Bissell pinned Army at its own 6-yard line, but Artice Hobbs got the Black Knights out of trouble quickly with a nifty 18-yard run right after a pitch from Hopkins on the first play of the drive.\n\nThe Black Knights then used the pass to strike again and put Lafayette in a deep hole. With the Leopards intent on trying to stop the run, Hopkins found a wide-open Holt for a 32-yard gain. Holt scored on an 8-yard run to the right off another pitch with 41 seconds left in the second quarter, giving Army a 17-3 lead.\n\nKordenbrock's 43-yard field goal as time expired gave the Leopards a boost going into the break. It was short-lived for a team that was averaging 14 points a game and found little give in the Army defense. Lafayette converted just 2 of 8 third-down tries while Army converted all but one of its 13.\n\n\"We were able to drive it fairly consistently ... out of our spread formations,\" Garrett said. \"We just weren't able to convert on third down. It was there periodically, but they're a good defense. There were some times where we got behind on the chains against the wind, so it's hard to throw it when it's third-and-13.\"\n\nIn honor of Veterans Day, the Leopards had special decals on their helmets to honor the military .\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLafayette: The Leopards, like most of the teams in the Patriot League, are in a down year but can salvage a measure of respect with a win next week against Lehigh in the most-played football rivalry in the nation. The teams have played 153 times since 1884.\n\nArmy: The Black Knights have become a force in their home stadium, going unbeaten last year and raising their record this year to 5-0 with one game left.\n\nNO PASSING FANCY\n\nArmy ranked second nationally in rushing entering the game, averaging 306.6 yards, and racked up 313 on Saturday. But Hopkins again demonstrated that teams have to respect his arm with the two key completions.\n\nLEOPARDS GROUNDED\n\nLafayette scored its lone touchdown in the fourth quarter when QB Sean O'Malley finally got untracked. He had completions on screen passes of 23 yards to CJ Amill and 10 yards to Dunn and hit Tim Payne over the middle for 19 yards to set up a 3-yard scoring toss to Will Eisler. The Leopards had four first downs on the drive and only nine for the game to 23 for Army.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nLafayette hosts Lehigh next Saturday.\n\nArmy hosts unbeaten Colgate in the season finale at home next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Keatts said he and Steere had a discussion Friday about Steere's future in the program. \"I told him to sit back and give it a couple of days and decide if this is the best fit for him or if there's another place that he feels like he could go,\" Keatts said.

And it's not the first time. USA TODAY\n\nepa07155655 Members of the caravan of Central American migrants prepare to leave Mexico City and resume their journey to the United States, in Mexico City, Mexico, 10 November 2018. After failing to get the UN to provide free transportation, the thousands of migrants from the caravan of Central Americans camped in Mexico City agreed to prepare to leave the capital on Saturday and resume their march on foot to the United States. Groups of migrants, mostly young, did not comply with this decision and left early in the morning for Queretaro, north of the capital, although most of the approximately 5,000 people in the caravan remained in the camp, following the indications of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the organization that accompanies them. EPA/Sashenka Gutierrez EPA-EFE/SASHENKA GUTIERREZ ORG XMIT: AME1802 (Photo: SASHENKA GUTIERREZ, EPA-EFE)\n\nMEXICO CITY - The caravan of Central American migrants set out on Saturday on foot from Mexico City as more migrants winding their way through southern Mexico were expected to converge on the national capital in the coming days.\n\nBundling up on a cool morning and toting backpacks with blankets and sleeping cushions, thousands of migrants trudged along Mexico City\u2019s perimeter highway and through its northern suburbs, hoping to hitch rides to take them more than 120 miles to the city of Quer\u00e9taro. The main migrant caravan, destined for Tijuana, remains a long way from the U.S. southern border. And they face a new asylum policy that went effect Saturday that does not allow anyone to apply unless they come through a border entry point. The ACLU and others are challenging the move in court.\n\nMany migrants had been hoping to obtain transportation to take them through some of Mexico\u2019s most troubled states to the U.S.-Mexico border. But the buses failed to materialize, prompting impatience for many \u2013 including a group of several hundred migrants, who left for Quer\u00e9taro Friday morning.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay in one place for too long,\u201d said Honduran migrant Jorge P\u00e9rez, 29, as he left the Cuatro Caminos subway station and started walking the thoroughfare out of town.\n\n\u201cMexico is taking care of us, but our objective isn\u2019t to stay here,\u201d he added after spending four nights at a sports stadium provided for by Mexico City for the caravan travelers. \u201cThe goal is to go northward.\u201d\n\nMexico City marked a milestone for the caravan, which covered more than 1,000 miles after leaving San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on Oct. 12. The caravan has crossed closed borders, pushed past police blockades and became a prop in the U.S. midterm elections \u2013 though most of the migrants carried little knowledge of the U.S. political storm.\n\nThe original caravan is expected to travel 1,750 miles toward Tijuana, passing through Guadalajara and going north along Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast. The road is rife with risks and passes through the drug cartel heartland of Sinaloa state.\n\nCaravan coordinators had demanded the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide buses to take them to Tijuana \u2013 and some 200 migrants marched to the UN office in the posh Polanco district of Mexico City to press their unsuccessful claim.\n\nThe UN said in a statement Friday that it was accompanying the caravan and supporting the Mexican government with processing asylum claims, but it was not in a position to provide transportation because it was the responsibility of government authorities.\n\n\u201cThe UN turned their backs on us worse than anyone,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has vowed that the caravan will not cross into the United States and has ordered the deployment of up to 15,000 troops to the border ahead of its arrival. Many in the caravan didn\u2019t seem dissuaded by Trump\u2019s threats, nor plans announced Thursday to limit asylum requests to only those presenting themselves at an authorized port of entry \u2013 with those crossing into the country illegally being subject to detention and expedited deportation.\n\nMore: Why Central Americans are fleeing their countries in migrant caravans\n\n\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have a heart. He speaking as if he didn\u2019t have a family, didn\u2019t have children,\u201d said Gabriela L\u00f3pez, 20, a Honduran migrant heading north with an 11-month-old baby.\n\n\u201cI want to work and work hard and be able to build a house for my mother\u201d back in Honduras, she said. \u201cGod\u2019s been guiding me every step of this journey and providing for us.\u201d\n\n102918-migrant caravan-map_Online (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nThe first caravan\u2019s progress into the heart of the country has encouraged more caravans to form. Two caravans traversing southern Mexico merged as one after arriving in the town of Mat\u00edas Romero, some 415 miles from Mexico City, according to Mexican media reports.\n\nObservers studying Central American migration say the caravans offer protection in numbers because Mexico can be perilous for most migrants. Human rights organizations are providing oversight as the caravans progress through Mexico. It also costs less as migrants can skip paying a \u201ccoyote\u201d to take them north.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to take the trip [north,] but didn\u2019t dare to do it alone,\u201d said L\u00f3pez, who added she made little money selling clothes in a market and that extortion demands from gangs have eroded her meager earnings. She also noted that coyotes were asking for $6,000 to get her to the U.S, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t have that kind of money.\u201d\n\nMexico has offered temporary work visas to caravan participants, along with healthcare and the chance for them to enroll their children in school. The Mexican government says 2,697 temporary visas have been issued to individuals and families as they wait for the 45-day application process for legal, permanent status.\n\nSome of the applicants for asylum appear to have left the city of Tapachula near the Guatemala border, where their claims were made, and have joined the caravan still in southern Mexico, the Mexican newspaper El Universal reported Friday.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nMore: ACLU goes to court to challenge Trump\u2019s new asylum ban\n\nMore: President Trump denies asylum for immigrants at U.S. border who enter outside ports of entry\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/10/migrant-caravan-donald-trump-immigration-southern-us-border-mexico-honduras-asylum/1956952002/", "BUFFALO, N.Y.

USA TODAY\n\nWhile the Saints appear to have lost Dez Bryant, they still have star receiver Michael Thomas. (Photo: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA quick glance at items of interest as NFL Week 10 rolls on \u2026\n\nWho\u2019s hot\n\nMichael Thomas. The production that Thomas has had as the primary wide receiver target for Drew Brees (70 catches, 880 yards, five TDs) is even more impressive when considering the Saints have been challenged to establish a complementary wideout. Regardless of the coverage and defensive schemes, Brees just keeps connecting with Thomas \u2013 whose rise as an elite player in his three NFL seasons is fortified by dedicated, professional work habits.\n\nHis franchise-record 211 yards and game-sealing, 72-yard TD in the big win against the Rams last weekend further illustrated his impact. Good idea, Sean Payton, to add a hungry Dez Bryant to the mix. Too bad it appears Bryant is done before he ever got started, with what is feared to be a torn Achilles tendon, another of the injuries (Ted Ginn, Cameron Meredith) that have depleted the wideout options. With a potential shootout looming at Cincinnati, Brees has other premium options in the passing game, such as running back Alvin Kamara. But to keep the flow going, the Saints (7-1) are going to need Thomas to keep beating the schemes designed to take him away.\n\nPressure\u2019s on\n\nJason Garrett. It\u2019s rather remarkable that the Cowboys have maintained such dynamic appeal. They are still the NFL\u2019s top TV draw, with annual meltdowns \u2013 and a potential beatdown from the similarly desperate Eagles on Sunday night at the Linc -- featured in prime time. The Cowboys are the most valuable franchise in sports, lead the NFL in merchandise sales and in overall attendance. Yet they are on the verge (3-5) of another deflating campaign. And so used to it.\n\nIn nearly 23 years since the franchise\u2019s last taste of Super Bowl glory, Dallas has won two playoff games. No, that\u2019s not all on Garrett (0-2 playoff record), but the pattern of uninspiring mediocrity continues on his watch \u2013 so much so that Cowboys legend Troy Aikman, mindful of the intensifying heat on Garrett, suggests a \u201ccomplete overhaul\u201d of the organization. Sure, Jerry Jones, on his sixth coach since Jimmy Johnson, has heard that theme before amid the franchise\u2019s funky culture for winning \u2026 and vibrant culture for making money. But maybe even Jones wonders: How much longer can my franchise remain so popular, with these sorry results?\n\nKey matchup\n\nBill Belichick vs. Malcolm Butler. As expected, in the days leading up to New England\u2019s visit to Tennessee, the Patriots\u2019 coach shed no new light on his Super Bowl LII benching of Butler (in a setback where they could have used more coverage). But at least Butler \u2013 who joined forces with former Patriot Mike Vrabel, the new Titans coach \u2013 can prove a point with his performance. It won\u2019t be easy, with Josh Gordon and likely Rob Gronkowski needing to be covered, and with Tom Brady slinging the rock. But it\u2019s a test both ways as Tennessee has the NFL\u2019s best red-zone defense, with a 31.8-percent TD rate. Brady gave Butler the truck he won as MVP of Super Bowl XLIX, which was sealed by the crafty cornerback\u2019s goal-line interception.\n\nNext man up\n\nJosh McCown. Sure, over the course of a 16-game season, he\u2019s been here before. Yet McCown (73 career starts) will step in for the first time this season, as Jets rookie franchise quarterback Sam Darnold nurses a foot injury and Buffalo visits. What if McCown lights it up? No controversy. The Jets are committed to Darnold for the long haul. Yet given growing pains for Darnold, who has thrown an NFL-high 14 interceptions while operating behind a spotty O-line, there is no reason to rush him back.\n\nMORE: NFL Week 10 matchups to watch: Will Golden Tate burn Cowboys in Eagles debut?\n\nMORE: USA TODAY Sports' Week 10 NFL picks\n\nRookie watch\n\nSaquon Barkley. The big-play running back is like the consolation prize for another season that has gone off the rails for the Giants (1-7). Barkley has a shot at achieving the rare feat of hitting the 1,000-yard mark for both rushing and receiving, which validates the talent that moved the G-men to draft him No. 2 overall, but makes you wonder whether all of that production is being wasted. Nonetheless, the production offers hope. And Barkley, second in the NFL for yards from scrimmage (1,016) and for percentage of his team\u2019s TDs (33.2 percent), heads into Monday night\u2019s game at San Francisco carrying a streak of three consecutive games with at least nine receptions.\n\nIf the playoffs were today \u2026\n\nThe Chargers would be a team you don\u2019t want to play. Los Angeles (6-2) will be hard-pressed to overtake the Chiefs for the A-West title, but with a five-game winning streak, it has established positioning for the AFC\u2019s top wild-card slot \u2013 and that will be a tough out. Amid a banner season from Philip Rivers (19 TDs, three INTs), they have rocked with big plays. The yardage on his last eight TD passes, over four games: 30, 12, 55, 75, 29, 45, 13, 44. Big plays. Perhaps by January they\u2019ll have Joey Bosa in the flow, too. With Bosa yet to play this season due to a foot injury, the Chargers have gone heavier on blitzes to help generate a rush good for 15 sacks during the winning streak.\n\nStomach for an upset\n\nJaguars at Colts. With Andrew Luck\u2019s comeback looking better by the week, Indianapolis (3-5) has a Top-10 offense again and has won consecutive games for the first time since 2015. That\u2019s part of the reason the Colts are favored at home against their division rival. Another reason has been the meltdown of the defending AFC South champions. The Jags still have a No. 2-ranked defense (by yards), but they\u2019ve also been undone by Blake Bortles\u2019 turnover issues. Yet look who\u2019s poised to return: Leonard Fournette, who has started just two games this season (and finished none) due to a lingering hamstring injury. If he can handle a full load, the formula for Jacksonville changes for the better.\n\nDid you notice?\n\nThe Texans (6-3), on a bye this weekend while leading the AFC South, are the first NFL team to follow an 0-3 start with a six-game winning streak since the 1970 New York Giants.\n\nStat\u2019s the fact\n\nIn his six games since returning, Carson Wentz has passed for 300 yards three times \u2013 and the Eagles are 0-3 in those contests. When Wentz hasn\u2019t hit the 300 mark, the Eagles are 3-0.", "", "Minnesota Timberwolves guard Jimmy Butler (23) gets around Sacramento Kings guard Buddy Hield (24) for a basket during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Sacramento, Calif., Friday, Nov. 9, 2018. (AP Photo/Steve Yeater) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJimmy Butler has his wish: He's out of Minnesota.\n\nAnd just like that, Philadelphia has a new Big Three \u2014 one that could make serious noise in the Eastern Conference.\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation said Saturday that Butler is being traded to the 76ers in a package that will send Dario Saric and Robert Covington to the Timberwolves. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade had not yet been announced by either team and was still pending NBA approval, which is not expected until Monday.\n\nJustin Patton will also be sent to Philadelphia, and Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick are also going to Minnesota, the person said.\n\nThe Athletic first reported the agreement.\n\nBecause the trade was not official, Sixers coach Brett Brown had little comment.\n\n\"I can't speak much about it. I'm sorry,\" he said before the Sixers played Memphis.\n\nSixers guard T.J. McConnell said he learned of the deal through social media.\n\n\"I didn't think it was true until more reports started coming out,\" McConnell said. \"It's kind of that feeling in your stomach of just like, I mean, you can't really explain it. I was in disbelief.\"\n\nPhiladelphia's \"Process\" led it to the second round of the playoffs last season behind two of the game's youngest, brightest stars in big man Joel Embiid and point guard Ben Simmons. Butler, an elite wing player and outstanding defender, will join them in a quest to rule the Eastern Conference now that LeBron James is out West with the Los Angeles Lakers following eight straight trips to the NBA Finals with Miami and Cleveland.\n\n\"I think they were a contender before,\" James said, giving his reaction to the deal Saturday. \"So it only enhances what they're able to do. I mean, they've got Ben and Joel and now you're adding Jimmy. I think that's a very, very good team.\"\n\nThe first order of business will be making the trade official, so Butler can debut for Philly either Monday at Miami or Wednesday at Orlando. The next step for Philadelphia will be coming to an agreement on an extension for Butler, a pending free agent who made clear to Minnesota that he would not be re-signing there in 2019.\n\nTranslated: The Wolves had to trade him, or they would lose him for nothing.\n\nThe drama has been constant from Butler's first practice with the Wolves this season, and the team's start while waiting for this inevitable move has been lousy. Minnesota finished a 0-5 road trip with a loss in Sacramento on Friday night and is 4-9 overall \u2014 winless in eight games on the road.\n\nButler played in 10 of those games, averaging 21.3 points. It was a peculiar arrangement; the Timberwolves were still running things through him often, even while the worst-kept secret in the NBA was that he wanted a change of address. Plenty of teams were mentioned along the way \u2014 Houston, the Los Angeles Clippers, Miami among them \u2014 as top candidates.\n\n\"I think him getting a fresh start on a team like ours will be beneficial to both sides,\" McConnell said.\n\nButler, 29, has been an All-Star in each of the last four seasons. There are also concerns, though they clearly didn't put off Philadelphia. Butler has missed at least 15 games in four of the last five seasons, including a career-high 23 games last year while dealing with a knee injury.\n\nPhiladelphia, who had just nine available players against the Grizzlies in part because of the pending move, will become Butler's third team, after Chicago and Minnesota. He's a career 16.5 point-per-game scorer, though that is skewed by his first two seasons, which were meager on the scoring front. He's on pace this season to average at least 20 points for the fifth consecutive year.\n\n\"Welcome to the best sports city in America,\" quarterback Carson Wentz of the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles tweeted to Butler.\n\nSaric is in his third season and averaging 11.1 points, shooting only 36 percent. Covington had been a starter for Philadelphia for the bulk of the last four-plus seasons and is averaging 11.3 points per game this year.\n\nPhiladelphia and Minnesota don't meet until Jan. 15. Butler's return trip to Minnesota this season would be March 30, when he's sure to be showered with boos from a Target Center crowd that jeered him at the beginning of the home opener before quickly letting up. Butler had 33 points on 10-for-12 shooting from the floor in 36 minutes that night against Cleveland, a reminder amid the drama why coach Tom Thibodeau was so eager to acquire him the year before.\n\nThibodeau swung a draft-night deal with Chicago that sent Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and a first-round pick that became Lauri Markkanen to the Bulls for Butler and a later first-rounder Minnesota used on Patton. In the wake of that move, long-frustrated Wolves fans figured they were finally on their way to contending in the Western Conference for the first time since the Kevin Garnett era ended.\n\nPaired with Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, the first overall picks in the 2015 and 2014 drafts, respectively, Butler immediately provided the experience, tenacity and defense the Wolves were missing, in addition to his scoring touch. He loved playing for Thibodeau, his coach for his first five seasons with the Bulls, and they helped Minnesota get to the playoffs last spring for the first time in 14 years.\n\nBut the roster never truly meshed. And now, a new start awaits them all.\n\n___\n\nAP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami, AP Sports Writer Dave Campbell in Minneapolis and freelancer Clay Bailey in Memphis, Tennessee, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It can be your neighbor or co-worker. It can be your friend. Security threats are everywhere and nowhere \u2013 in America and around the world.\n\nSecurity experts agree that the menace from terrorism, hate crimes and other forms of extreme violence can\u2019t be fully eradicated any more than the threat from, say, armed robbery. Vulnerability is hard-wired into the human experience.\n\nBut the attack on the dance floor of a California nightclub late Wednesday that left 13 dead, the 11 worshipers killed by a gunman Oct. 27 at a Pittsburgh synagogue and the Oct. 26 pipe bomb suspect\u2019s arrest for targeting prominent Democrats \u2013 raise profound questions about what if anything can be learned from other countries used to dealing with radical domestic terror and violence.\n\nMore: What we know about the fatal mass shooting at a Thousand Oaks, California, dance bar\n\nMore: Suspect in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting pleads not guilty\n\nMore: For accused pipe bomber Cesar Sayoc, life was a stage where the truth was a bit player\n\nIn Israel, it's hard to enter a supermarket or a bus station without passing through a metal detector. Britain responded to years of politically motivated bombing campaigns by Northern Ireland's paramilitaries by installing closed-circuit television cameras on every street corner. Today, the country has a CCTV camera for every 11 people.\n\nArmed guards, police security patrols, safe rooms and sophisticated surveillance systems are now routine measures deployed by Jewish synagogues, schools and restaurants in France following a wave of anti-Semitic attacks that began decades ago.\n\nHungarian synagogues are linked by a centralized, rapid \"early warning system\" that alerts Jewish prayer houses in the rest of the eastern European nation of an attack.\n\nJapan removed trash cans from subway stations and local parks following a Sarin gas attack by one of its citizens that killed 13 people and sickened thousands. Its security officials concluded they were a good place to hide incendiary devices.\n\nAustralia made sweeping gun control measures after a man killed 35 people with a semi-automatic weapon in a popular tourist area in 1996. The country banned rapid-fire guns and offered to buy prohibited firearms. Research suggests it's worked.\n\nHigh cost of security\n\nOphir Revach, the CEO of a security center attached to the European Jewish Congress, a Brussels-based group that represents Jewish communities across the Continent, said it would take more than a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars before American houses of worship \u2014 synagogues, mosques, churches \u2014 or private firms, which includes nightclubs, would be able to match the security arrangements in Europe.\n\n\"It takes a lot of effort to analyze each building and see what type of security it needs,\" he said. \"We started this in Europe over 50 years ago and we\u2019re still not finished,\" Revach said, noting that American synagogues and minority communities, in general, could take an easy, first step: ensure their entrance doors are closed.\n\nMourners visit the memorial outside the Tree of Life Synagogue on October 31, 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pa. Eleven people were killed in a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood on Oct. 27. (Photo: Jeff Swensen, Getty Images)\n\nRobert Bowers, the truck driver charged with shooting 11 Jews to death in Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue, burst through an open door. Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old white supremacist who was convicted of the 2015 murder of nine African-American worshippers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. walked straight into the building. Details about what happened Wednesday night at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, outside Los Angeles, are still emerging. Eyewitness accounts suggest former Marine Ian David Long threw a smoke grenade into the bar before opening fire with a handgun, killing at least 12 people.\n\nMany inside the bar mistakenly thought the gunshot sounds were fireworks.\n\n\"Most of the front doors in American synagogues are being left open,\" Revach added.\n\nLimiting the damage\n\nErik Prince, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and Trump ally who founded the Blackwater private security firm and is now chairman of Frontier Services Group, which does security across Africa mostly for Chinese firms, said that organizations of all kinds should develop an immediate response system to limit the damage a killer can cause.\n\n\"Logic shows that the most effective preventative measure possible is defensive security as close to the point of danger as possible: that when mass killers are confronted by armed force, the attack ends quickly,\" he said. \"That happened at a school in North Carolina in 2006, in Salt Lake City in 2007, and at a shop in upstate New York in 2010.\"\n\nLogic, and data, also show the USA has more mass shootings than any other country and there is a strong correlation between the number of mass shootings and high rates of gun ownership. According to a 2016 study by criminal justice professor Adam Lankford of the University of Alabama, between 1966-2012, a third of worldwide mass shootings took place in the USA. Americans own over 40 percent of over 650 million civilian firearms worldwide, says the Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based group.\n\nThe California incident was the 307th mass shooting in the U.S. during 2018, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, an online database. In all, 328 people died in those incidents, and 1,251 were injured, according to the data. A mass shooting is defined as an incident in which four or more people were shot and killed.\n\nStill, Prince, like gun rights advocates, appears to agree with Trump, who said the \u201cresults would have been far better\u201d if the Pittsburgh synagogue had an armed guard. There are examples, however, where the presence of an armed guard has not prevented tragedy and some studies suggest that armed guards can actually increase the likelihood of violence.\n\nThe gunman in California on Wednesday shot a security guard on the way into the dancehall and live music venue. A sheriff\u2019s deputy was slain responding to the attack.\n\nWhen Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas last year, he did so by shooting at them while perched on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. In February, a police officer failed to confront a shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Florida, in a massacre that left 17 students and staff members dead. Video footage shows the police officer not entering the school building.\n\nStill, Revach, of the European Jewish Congress, which has offered its help to American Jewish communities following the Pittsburgh attack, pointed to the example of Dan Uzan, a volunteer guard at a Danish synagogue whose intervention in 2015 preventing an armed extremist from carrying out an attack inside the building saved dozens of lives, apart from his own. Uzan slowed down the assailant. He never made it inside the synagogue. Police were able to shoot him. Uzan died in the process.\n\nBut Prince stressed that this should not be a top-down, dictated federal solution.\n\n\"States, counties and municipalities are in a better position to adapt practical defensive solutions adapted from best practices. Wyoming will certainly handle this differently than Pittsburgh or Connecticut would. Some will depend on resilient faculty or parents, while some will opt for armed contracted guards. The most important thing is to be practical, not emotional, about what actually works,\" he added.\n\nDifferent countries, different responses\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear that looking to what other nations are doing is all that useful, according to Michael Payne, a global security advisor at WorldAware, a risk-management firm.\n\nCountries have different risk profiles consisting of different threat variations, vulnerabilities, risk appetites and protective capabilities, he said. \"In the U.S., 85 percent of critical infrastructure sectors are owned and operated by private organizations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, violent \"homegrown\" extremists have been active in the USA for decades.\n\nIn one of the deadliest attacks in American history, Timothy McVeigh, an anti-government radical, set off a truck bomb in front of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 that killed 168 people. (The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by foreign nationals.)\n\nIn late Oct., Gregory Bush, a white man, was charged with killing two African-Americans in a racially motivated murder at a grocery store in Kentucky. Bush had previously tried to enter a predominantly African-American church in the same area.\n\nSince the 9/11 attacks, at least 225 people have died on U.S. soil at the hands of violent extremists, according to the U.S. Extremist Crime Database. The number of attacks by the far-right has outnumbered those by radicalized Muslims by about 3-to-1.\n\nJewish leaders across America have been reassessing the steps they need to take to enhance protections in the wake of the Pittsburgh shootings, including increased vigilance for threats that originate on the Internet and social media and backing a standardized definition of anti-Semitism for all government agencies and universities.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, an international Jewish organization, said anti-semitism in the USA is becoming \"normalized\" and that while recent polls have shown the majority of Americans do not hold anti-Semitic feelings \u2014 about 14 percent do \u2014 acts of vandalism, violence and harassment directed at Jewish organizations and individuals have increased sharply: up 57 percent this year.\n\nFred Dobb, a rabbi at the Adat Shalom Reconstructionist Congregation, outside Washington, said that staff at his synagogue have already taken steps to ensure worshippers' safety that also doesn't \"turn our sanctuaries into fortresses.\"\n\n\"Like most communities we want members and guests to feel and be safe ... and everyone to continue to feel welcome,\" he said. \"That is our sacred balancing act.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/10/mass-shooting-california-pittsburgh-synagogue-terrorism-global-hate-crimes-extreme-violence/1831200002/", "CLOSE Dr. Seuss' classic Christmas tale \"The Grinch\" returns to the big screen this holiday season.

By the end, the transformed Grinch goes so mushy that he utters a profound apology to the citizens of Whoville for his past wicked ways.\n\n\"I'm so very sorry for everything,\" he says as he returns all the toys and decorations he has stolen to ruin their celebration.\n\nCumberbatch, who has played the full spectrum of antisocial, rude characters \u2013 from Smaug the dragon to Sherlock Holmes \u2013 loved the journey.\n\nMore: 'The Grinch' Benedict Cumberbatch gets cranky about Christmas sweaters, standards on repeat\n\nRelated: There's a new version of 'You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch': Our hearts grew three sizes\n\n\"You find out more about why the Grinch is the way he is. Then you can enjoy his meanness,\" Cumberbatch says. \"We get insight into what makes him tick. So it is not just the villain without having some understanding of where it\u2019s all coming from.\"\n\nDirectors Yarrow Cheney and Scott Mosier spent four years bringing Theodor Seuss Geisel's (aka Dr. Seuss) character to life on the big screen. They knew they were going to have to expand the Grinch beyond the pages and the faithful TV special to make an 95-minute movie.\n\nThe Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) plays the organ with a little help from his dog Max on drums in \"The Grinch.\" (Photo: ILLUMINATION/UNIVERSAL PICTURES)\n\nThey start with the full-nasty Grinch. (He knocks a child's snowman over, then nails the shocked kid with a snowball. Double Grinch points!) But the sensitive moments sneak in.\n\nThe Grinch stress-eats (good explanation for the paunch), dons a Lycra workout bodysuit (nice irony) and plays a moving version of \"All By Myself\" on the pipe organ.\n\nThere's a new backstory: The Grinch grew up without a family in an orphanage, and he became bitter about the joyful Christmas holiday.\n\n\"We wanted to start him out with his fun Grinchiness, the Grinch we know and love,\" Cheney says. \"But we go on the entire journey with him. He\u2019s this character in denial, with a worldview constructed to protect himself.\"\n\nThe original Grinch (voiced by Boris Karloff) from the 1966 TV special \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" (Photo: ABC)\n\nProducer Christopher Meledandri, who has worked with Dr. Seuss' widow, Audrey Geisel, since adapting \"Horton Hears a Who!\" in 2008, says the author's family supported the sensitive transformation.\n\nIn his mind, the green Grinch masks childhood pain from his desolate cave.\n\n\"For me, it's a metaphor for how we deal with early emotional wounds, developing coping mechanisms. The Grinch had sequestered himself away from any sort of hurt,\" Meledandri says. \"The cynical, grumpy attitude was really a protective wall.\"\n\nIn the original \"Grinch,\" the evilness melts away upon hearing the town singing joyfully even without toys. The Grinch saves his precariously overloaded sleigh of loot, triumphantly sails back into Whoville to return the booty, then cuts the Christmas roast beast as an honored guest. No \"sorry\" is uttered.\n\nRon Howard's critically derided 2000 live-action \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" featured Jim Carrey's Grinch giving his mea culpa to the Whos and ugly-crying (way, way too much).\n\nThe new Grinch apology is simple and eloquent. Mosier says the small peeks into the hurt heart that heals add a fuller explanation, while the Grinch fundamentals are firmly intact.\n\n\"There\u2019s a little Grinch in all of us,\" Mosier says. \"The reason why the Grinch is timeless is because you can make subtle alterations and still have the same essence and, ultimately, give the same message.\"\n\nCLOSE USA TODAY spoke with Benedict Cumberbatch about channeling Dr. Seuss' \"brilliant\" Grinch.

(Joe Giddens/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLEICESTER, England (AP) \u2014 The soundtrack to Leicester's sporting fairytale now carries a mournful melody.\n\nOn the streets where improbable success was toasted two years ago, the \"Champions of England\" chant reverberated again on Saturday, this time as the chorus for thousands of fans marching with players to the scene of unthinkable tragedy.\n\nA melancholic lyric has been added to honor the owner who made one of the greatest sporting underdog successes possible: \"Champions of England. You made us sing that.\" It is why Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha will always be held in deep regard by the people of Leicester, where soccer returned for the first time since the Thai entrepreneur's death.\n\n\"The Boss\" was the simple message on many T-shirts as up to 20,000 people embarked on a mile-long walk to the stadium where two weeks ago the 60-year-old Vichai died when his helicopter spiraled out of control shortly after taking off from the center circle.\n\nIt is the field where Vichai lifted the English Premier League trophy in May 2016, the culmination of an incredible journey taking an unglamorous team from the second tier to the pinnacle of English soccer. That was the day when tears of joy followed as tenor Andrea Bocelli serenaded manager Claudio Ranieri.\n\n\"Time to Say Goodbye\" carried a new sorrowful significance on Saturday when a recording of Bocelli was played in King Power Stadium after Saturday's 0-0 draw against Burnley. Vichai's son, vice chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, led the players around the field to thank fans who held aloft white scarves emblazoned with \"Forever in our hearts.\" Clutching a Thai flag, Aiyawatt was embraced by goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel at the end of a lap of appreciation as the team and supporters applauded.\n\nWatching on, Ranieri looked close to tears on his return to Leicester. The Italian, whose reign ended nine months after the 5,000-1 longshot's title win, returned to mourn the late chairman along with his predecessor and successor as manager.\n\n\"His love and his passion helped us to achieve something amazing,\" Ranieri said. \"Something that will be remembered forever.\"\n\nThe billionaire bought the struggling club in 2010 while in the second tier. In an era of mega-rich super clubs winning the English top-flight seemed unattainable for unfashionable teams like Leicester. With investment in the squad, but not vast sums, Vichai made the impossible dream possible.\n\n\"You don't support Leicester City to win things. Other people do that with other teams,\" fan Glyn Morgans, who has been coming to Leicester games since 1969, said on the 5,000-1 walk named after Leicester's title odds. \"Leicester people support Leicester because they are local people who love their local team.\"\n\nNow, though, Leicester is a name that resonates around the world.\n\n\"Even when we are on holiday people come up to us and say they are so pleased Leicester did it, a small club like Leicester,\" fan Margaret Bennett said as sunshine gave way to a downpour on the march to the stadium that was led by injured players, including defender Harry Maguire.\n\nThe hundreds of jerseys and floral tributes that amassed outside the stadium within days of the tragedy have been moved to an open space close to where Vichai's helicopter crashed in a ball of flames after the Oct. 27 night game against West Ham.\n\nGoalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was still in the stadium an hour after the final whistle when he watched Vichai's blue aircraft take off as normal from the field, and he waved off the chairman. It was soon spiraling out of control and Schmeichel raced to the fire in a carpark.\n\n\"What happened next will stay with me forever,\" Schmeichel said in a 100-page matchday magazine dedicated completely to the five victims of the helicopter crash. \"It has replayed through my head every minute since, wishing there was something more I could have done. I stood for a long time at the police cordon at the back of the carpark ... tears streaming down my face.\"\n\nSchmeichel was among the players who flew briefly to Thailand a week ago to pay respects to Vichai at a Bangkok temple during a weeklong funeral ceremony.\n\nNow the entire club could commemorate Vichai on matchday. The stadium fell silent for five minutes before kickoff as a video tribute to Vichai was played on big screens before chants of \"Vichai\" broke out. The day carried an additional poignancy as wreaths were also laid and an additional minute's silence held to mark 100 years since the end of World War I.\n\n\"This week has been hard,\" Leicester winger Marc Albrighton said. \"Leicester fans have been brilliant for us and we need them. It's going to be a tough road. The lads are emotionally drained. Today was one of the hardest games I have ever played.\"\n\nBefore the game, club officials including Aiyawatt viewed the area that has become a makeshift memorial to his father a few minutes' walk from the stadium. The Leicester vice chairman, who is also known as Top, inspected the carpet of flowers that have been formed in front of a picture of Vichai and the word \"boss\" in blue and white flowers. Of the hundreds of soccer jerseys from Leicester and rival clubs that were placed outside the stadium in the days after the disaster, some now encircle the pitch while others have been placed on railings near the stadium.\n\nFans who traveled from the northwest city of Burnley added their only tributes and took inspiration from the 2016 success.\n\n\"Everyone was a Leicester fan that year,\" Burnley fan Roy Addison said. \"It showed to a small club anything is possible. Nothing is impossible.\"\n\nGrief will, however, forever be associated with the glory here.\n\nPremier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore found a flicker of optimism at a dark moment. Supporters gathering in English streets holding banners of team owners usually signals discontent and protest. In Leicester, they have only affection for Vichai.\n\n\"The reaction showed a huge tolerance,\" Scudamore said in the days after Vichai's death. \"It's probably put to bed the idea there are foreign owners and there are English owners, and all the foreigners are bad and all the English owners are good.\"\n\nNow Leicester, with Claude Puel as coach, has to look to the future on the field with the team 10th in the 20-team standings.\n\nAlthough the 32,184 attendance on Saturday was the biggest crowd of the season, the owner's death two years after the title win seems like the closing of a chapter to some fans.\n\n\"Games are a bit weird now we've had all that success,\" 21-year-old season ticketholder Sam Collins said. \"When you win and lose now it doesn't mean as much anymore because we've been to the pinnacle.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Those storylines about his interceptions from training camp were very overblown, but those are the types of stories that grab attention. The ones about Mahomes completing passes from end zone to end zone were considered a fairy tale if you didn\u2019t see it with your own eyes.\n\nI don\u2019t expect any considerable drop-off from Mahomes. We\u2019ve seen a bad Mahomes game this season. He threw two picks and no touchdown passes against the Jaguars. He also had a near 60 percent completion (rate), over 300 yards passing and a rushing touchdown. I think that\u2019s about as bad as you\u2019ll see from him this season.

He's proving it at the Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nThe Mercedes driver clocked the lap record at Interlagos in qualifying to earn pole position for the 10th time in 20 races this year.

Hamilton's pole was the 100th for the team.\n\nThe Brazilian race is the penultimate GP of the season, with Abu Dhabi closing it on Nov. 25.\n\nAfter confirming his pole position, Hamilton celebrated with local fans by punching the air and showing off the back of his helmet. It has the same colors as the one used by his boyhood hero and three-time world champion Ayrton Senna.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be in Brazil,\" a relaxed Hamilton said. \"I appreciate the love I get here.\"\n\nStands at Interlagos are expected to be filled on Sunday, mostly cheering for Hamilton, as there will be no Brazilian driver on the grid for the first time since 1970.\n\nVettel, who led the last practice on Saturday, did not sound frustrated after losing the pole for the race he won last year.\n\n\"It was good fun,\" the four-time world champion said. \"It was very close (to get the pole) but just a bit too much.\"\n\nBut he was later reprimanded and fined 25,000 euros ($28,300) for damaging the scales in a weighbridge incident during qualifying.\n\nVettel did not comment after the sanction.\n\nAnother incident that didn't cause any punishments involved Hamilton and Williams' Sergey Sirotkin, whom the world champion accused of being \"disrespectful\" by passing him on an out-lap. The two almost crashed at Interlagos as Hamilton was slowing his car. Sirotkin managed to avoid the Mercedes car by very little.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen, who won the Mexican GP two weeks ago, was fifth, and teammate Daniel Ricciardo sixth.\n\nRicciardo, however, will start five positions behind because of a penalty after his team had to replace his turbocharger for the sixth time this season.

(Photo: TCL)\n\nIf you've wanted to upgrade to 4K, but the thought of spending over $500 is just out of the question, you should check out the TCL Roku 4K TV. Not only is it an Amazon best-seller, but we've tested the TCL S Series and think very highly of it. For the price, this is an impressive TV. While it won't stand up to high-end alternatives in terms of brightness and contrast, it will make the average viewer happy with the purchase. I recently bought the 43-inch and I knew it was better than the price suggested, but I have been thrilled so far.

He signed for a 1-under 71 and 10 under overall. Oosthuizen made birdie on the last to finish with a 72 and two off Garcia when he was four behind on the last tee.\n\nThomas Detry, Mikko Korhonen and two-time Nedbank winner Lee Westwood are tied for third, three shots off the lead on 7 under. Ross Fisher is a further shot back.\n\nGarcia birdied his second and third holes but found it tough at the back end of his round again, with his wayward approach to the last green flying high into the rows of spectators up on the stands.\n\nOosthuizen took advantage with just his second birdie of the day, although he benefited from a fortunate kick off the right fringe of the green to set up his birdie putt.\n\nGarcia is seeking a second straight win after triumphing at home at the Andalucia Valderrama Masters last month, and a victory by the Spaniard would be the second wire-to-wire success of the season after Eddie Pepperell at the British Masters. Garcia has won twice at Sun City, but the last of those two titles was in 2003.\n\n\"I think if I can manage to shoot somewhere in the 60s, maybe 70 might be enough,\" said Garcia, who opened the tournament with an 8-under 64 before carding 71 and then 71 again on Saturday. \"I'm going to see if I can shoot below 70 and see if that's good enough.\"\n\nDetry is in contention after the young Belgian produced another birdie-filled back nine as he picked up shots on four of his last six holes for his 68.

Jefferson Graham reports on #TalkingTech Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY\n\nThe new Series 4 edition of the Apple Watch has a bigger, more colorful screen and one really cool new feature.\n\nIf you fall to the ground and don't get back up within 60 seconds, it will call 911 and get help on your behalf, automatically.\n\nBut what will it do about the cracked screen of the watch itself? Or more specifically, the screen that fell to the ground this week as I was adjusting the band and got destroyed?\n\nGetting a broken smartphone screen fixed is rather easy. Any shopping mall and most city centers have kiosks and store fronts eager to take care of all us klutzes who drop our phones and get screens easily replaced. One of the largest firms, uBreakIFix, has nearly 500 stores and says it fixes some 60,000 phones monthly, mostly due to broken screens.\n\nBut uBreakIFix won't touch the current edition of the Apple Watch. Neither does rival iCracked, or even Best Buy's Geek Squad.\n\nThe Apple Watch that fell to the ground and cracked (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nThe reason, Apple tells me, is that the Watch is designed in a more complicated fashion. It's not like the technicians can just remove one screen and replace it with another. They would need to take the entire watch apart to fix it. As Justin Wetherill, a uBreak co-founder said, \"The part alone on the Series 4 Watch costs me $180, and that's before adding in labor.\"\n\nThe bottom line, as I learned: You break an Apple Watch, you might as well buy a new one. The device starts at $399, and Apple's flat rate fee to fix a screen is $299. If you bought AppleCare (for $79), Apple will give you up to two fixes of \"accidental damage,\" at $69 a pop. Or in other words, you'd spend around $150 (Apple Care, plus the fee) to fix a watch you spent $400 on, or 37.5 percent of the initial cost.\n\nThese prices aren't that much higher than what Apple charges to fix iPhones \u2013 until you look at it on a percentage basis. Apple charges a hefty $329 to replace a cracked screen of the flagship 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max (or $29 if you spring $199 for AppleCare,) versus $279 for the smaller 5.8-inch XS, $199 for the 6.1-inch XR and just $149 for last year's 4.7-inch iPhone 8.\n\nIn other words, you know you will crack your iPhone screen at some point. Not buying AppleCare for protection of what's often a $1,000 investment is foolish.\n\n\"My general counsel bought the new Apple Watch and cracked it within 24 hours,\" Wetherill says. \"And we couldn't fix it. He brushed it against a staircase, and it was gone.\"\n\nMost people, knowing how fragile phones are, usually buy a case to protect their device at a cost of anywhere from $25 to $100.\n\nFor the Watch, Apple doesn't sell cases. But many third-party vendors do. In fact, a simple search for Apple Watch Series 4 cases on Amazon showed a cottage industry devoted to rather inexpensive looking $10 to $25 bumper protectors for the Watch. This wouldn't have saved me, as the screen fell straight to the ground, but who knows \u2013 maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWe reached out to Apple, which declined to comment.\n\nLongtime readers of the Talking Tech newsletter know that I've been consistent in asks for Apple when it comes to new features. Don't tell me about more power, augmented reality or anything else fancy; just give me an all-day battery and unbreakable glass. That's all I need.\n\nBut clearly, Apple doesn't want to make devices with unbreakable screens, or it would. Consider this: What's a good motivator for people to upgrade to new phones? Something is wrong with the current model, as in, a cracked screen. Fix the glass issue, and Apple won't sell as many new ones.\n\nIn diving into the world of smartwatches and cracked screens this week, I think back to the old tag line Timex used once upon a time for its watch: \"It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.\"\n\nThe Apple Watch won't keep on ticking. It needs to be charged, and it certainly won't take a licking. But hey, did a Timex ever call 911 when anyone fell down?\n\nThis week we spent several hours in wild Venice Beach, California in search of the definitive photo essay of one of Southern California most popular photography spots.

(Photo: Gary Garth for USA TODAY)\n\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK, N.D. \u2013 An hour or so before sunset, the landscape reflects a refracted prism hue. The colors are a pale rainbow in scattershot, with pinks, blues, reds, purples, yellows and endless variations reflecting from the rocks, which are something of a time capsule in vertical.\n\nThe Badlands sweep across the horizon in a freeze frame, the result of an eon of erosion. They are dazzling anytime but shimmer when the sun touches the horizon. It\u2019s prettier than I\u2019m describing.\n\nIf you don\u2019t count the wind, all is silence, reflective and lonesome but without a trace of loneliness.\n\nThat\u2019s not why Theodore Roosevelt came in September 1883, a 24-year-old New Yorker brimming with confidence. He came to hunt buffalo, which he did with success. He also bought a ranch and decided to become a cattleman and a cowboy. The newly installed Western businessman then returned to New York, where heartbreak awaited.\n\nA few months later, on Valentine\u2019s Day 1884, both Roosevelt\u2019s mother and wife died. Later that year he returned to the Dakota Territory, not to hunt, but to heal in the land\u2019s silence and solitude.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt National Park is spread across three North Dakota tracts that swallow 70,477 acres of natural wildness. The park is named for the president who established five national parks and birthed the country\u2019s conservation movement. It\u2019s a fitting monument.\n\nThe North Unit covers a little more than 24,000 acres, adjoins Highway 85 and is split by the Little Missouri River, which, depending on rainfall and runoff, ranges from rivulet to torrent. The South Unit is about 70 miles due south, is nearly twice as large at 46,159 acres and attracts more visitors thanks to Interstate 94, which hugs the park on the south side.\n\nThe 218-acre Elkhorn Ranch Unit, a spot on the Little Missouri River Roosevelt purchased for $400 in 1884 and about halfway between the North and South units, became his Dakota home, which Roosevelt recalled fondly.\n\n\u201cMy home ranch-house stands on the river ...\u201d he recorded in his book \"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman.\" \u201cThis veranda is a pleasant place in the summer evenings when a cool breeze stirs along the river and blows in the faces of the tired men, who loll back in their rocking-chairs ... gazing sleepily out at the weird-looking buttes opposite, until their sharp outlines grow indistinct and purple in the after-glow of the sunset.\u201d\n\nRoosevelt found what he was seeking in the work, the hunting, the scenery and the solitude.\n\nHe made several trips to the ranch before departing for good in 1890.\n\nHe left a changed man. Great things awaited, including a stint in the White House. Conservation became a cornerstone of his presidency. It was a devotion and commitment that would be traced back to this hard, lonesome, rugged, character-forming place.\n\n\u201cIt was here,\u201d he is famously and oft-quoted, \u201cthat the romance of my life began.\u201d\n\nIt can still have that effect on visitors.\n\nRoosevelt National Park remains largely undeveloped, just as Teddy would have it. More than 40 percent (29,920 acres) of the park\u2019s 70,447 total acres are designated wilderness.\n\nThe North Unit includes a small visitors center; a splendid, isolated campground; miles of hiking trails; a couple of CCC-era structures; buffalo; elk; a handful of longhorn cattle and other game. The Little Missouri River splits the stunning, Badlands landscape.\n\nThe single road into the unit ends at the Oxbow Overlook, from which the serpentine Little Missouri displays how the river has and does alter the landscape.\n\nThe surprisingly colorful Badlands terrain is dry, rough and rugged; a result of wind and erosion that erases soft sediment, scrubbing the land to a polish. It\u2019s worth a visit.\n\nIf you go\n\nRoosevelt National Park is open year-round. Around 600,000 people visit the park annually, the vast majority of which arrive in June, July and August.

(Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAs he looks to find his place within the Philadelphia Eagles' offense, Golden Tate has the benefit of making his debut against a team he knows how to burn.\n\nPlaying in his first game with Philadelphia since he was traded to the defending champions last Tuesday, Tate will be squaring off against the same Dallas Cowboys team against which he recorded eight catches for 134 yards and two touchdowns in October as a member of the Detroit Lions. In his second of what will be three turns against the Cowboys this year, Tate might hold the key to how both Sunday's NFC East tilt and the rest of the divisional race will unfold.\n\nAdding another weapon for the second half of the season was a crucial move for an Eagles offense that has been uneven. Running back Darren Sproles was expected to make his return this week, but he aggravated a hamstring injury and has already been ruled out.\n\nTate, however, can step in and turn short throws into big gains. Long viewed as one of the game's most dynamic threats with the ball in his hands, he ranks second among all wide receivers with 289 yards after the catch this season.\n\nUsing Tate on an assortment of screens and run-pass options should help integrate him into the offense and afford him opportunities without relying on him to master all the complexities of the playbook after just a week and a half. His skill set should also be welcome for an attack that has had protection issues (giving up 26 sacks in eight games) and could be without right tackle Lane Johnson, who is listed as questionable.\n\nDallas ranks fifth against the pass (217 yards allowed per game) and has mostly fared well in preventing big gains, having given up the fewest plays of at least 20 yards (24) of any team in the NFL. Yet the Cowboys have plenty of evidence of what not to do with Tate after this season's first matchup.\n\nOne of the key takeaways will be not affording him room underneath to operate, as the Eagles are likely content to get the ball in his hands on early downs and let him make a play in the open field. Tate got the best of cornerbacks Chidobie Awuzie and Jourdan Lewis as well as safety Xavier Woods, so Dallas might have to consider using breakout cornerback Byron Jones on him if he once again proves to be a problem. But the Cowboys also have to account for Alshon Jeffery.\n\nHere are four other matchups that will define Week 10 in the NFL:\n\nPatriots' wide receivers vs. Titans CB Malcolm Butler\n\nAhead of a showdown with his former team, Butler is in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The cornerback who rapidly rose to fame has experienced a similarly accelerated tailspin this season, ranking last at his position with the most catches (39), receiving yards (618) and touchdowns (seven) allowed, according to Pro Football Focus. Monday night's showing against the Cowboys was particularly trying, as he gave up two scores while in coverage.\n\nEven though Butler appears to be the weak link on the league's stingiest scoring defense (17.6 points per game), Titans coach Mike Vrabel is sticking by his starter. Yet that decision could be exploited by Bill Belichick and the Patriots. Josh Gordon is coming off season best totals for New England (five catches for 130 yards and a touchdown in a 31-17 win over the Packers), and Tom Brady might be inclined to pick on Butler rather than repeatedly take chances against Adoree' Jackson and Logan Ryan, another former Patriot.\n\nSaints RB Alvin Kamara vs. Bengals' linebackers\n\nThere are plenty of interesting subplots when New Orleans' second-ranked scoring attack takes on Cincinnati's last-ranked defense, including how cornerback William Jackson III handles shadowing wide receiver Michael Thomas and whether defensive linemen Geno Atkins and Carlos Dunlap can thwart Drew Brees. But Kamara is the figure most capable of determining the landscape of the game. The second-year back is on pace to set a franchise record with 24 touchdowns and is averaging 114.6 total yards from scrimmage per game.\n\nKamara's all-purpose ability would pose a problem for even a Bengals defense that has given up 4.9 yards per carry on the year and allowed at least 100 yards rushing in five of its last six games. But the linebacking corps will be without one of its best coverage assets in Nick Vigil, as well as Vontaze Burfict. If Vincent Rey and Jordan Evans are shaky in containing Kamara, Cincinnati could lose ground as it chases Pittsburgh in the AFC North.\n\nSeahawks' offensive line vs. Rams DT Aaron Donald\n\nDonald has confounded the Seahawks throughout his career, with his eight sacks against Russell Wilson in nine games representing his highest total against any other quarterback. But in Los Angeles' 33-31 win in October, Wilson was sacked just twice (once by Donald) and threw for three touchdowns. Perhaps even more notably, the Seahawks rushed for 190 yards as their long-maligned offensive front more than held its own against the Rams' vaunted line. Offensive guard D.J. Fluker boasted afterward that \"we literally kicked their (expletive) up front.\"\n\nRegardless of the fallout from Fluker's remark, winning up front will be vital for both teams in Sunday's rematch between the NFC West rivals. The Seahawks need their third-ranked rushing attack not only to pace the offense and keep the Rams off the field, but also to set Wilson up for big gains via play-action. Los Angeles, meanwhile, has to establish a push up front to help cover for a secondary that was repeatedly burnt last week when giving up a season-high 45 points and 487 yards of offense in the team's first loss of the season to the Saints.\n\nColts' offensive line vs. Jaguars' pass rush\n\nWhen Jacksonville notched 10 sacks against Indianapolis in a 27-0 shutout win last October, the game seemed like an inflection point for both franchises. Despite the absence of Andrew Luck, the Colts had to address the reality that their system and offensive line issues were proving lethal to their passing game. The Jaguars, meanwhile, appeared to have the building blocks in place for the league's next dominant defense.\n\nFast forward a year, however, and the two teams' fortunes appear to have flipped. Luck has been sacked just 10 times total this season and hasn't been taken down in his last 160 dropbacks. And though Jacksonville has still been able to generate pressure and is giving up the fewest yards through the air (190 per game) of any team, the pass rush hasn't finished with the same frequency it did last year, with the unit ranking 25th with just 19 sacks.\n\nIndianapolis ranks as one of the league's most pass-happy teams, and it doesn't seem likely that new coach Frank Reich will wilt in the face of the Jaguars' front. But Luck might need to rely on more of the short-area throws that were his early-season staple rather than taking the chances he did in recent weeks with improved protection.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "21.

USA TODAY\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Saturday. (Photo: LUDOVIC MARIN, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPARIS \u2013 While preoccupied with issues at home, President Donald Trump sat down Saturday with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron to discuss differences that revolve around Trump's more nationalist approach to global problems.\n\n\"We want to help Europe, but it has to be fair,\" Trump told Macron just hours after he and his French host clashed over American defense commitments in Europe. \"Right now, the burden sharing has been largely on the United States.\"\n\nMacron, who has proposed creating a \"European army\" because of what he sees as wavering U.S. support, told Trump his idea backs up the American's call for more burden sharing by Europe.\n\n\"We need more European capacities, more European defense,\" Macron said, speaking in both French and English.\n\nAfter Trump arrived at Elysee Palace on a gray and rainy morning, he and and Macron shook hands (briefly), smiled, and gave photographers thumbs-up signs, the morning after their very public clash about U.S. defense commitments in Europe.\n\nThings looked more tense before the actual meeting; Trump sat grim-faced as Macron smiled and gestured toward the U.S. president.\n\nWhile Trump traveled to Paris for World War I commemorations this weekend, his nationalistic criticism of long-standing global alliances \u2013 many of them built from the ashes of both world wars in the last century \u2013 has hovered over the proceedings.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and President Donald Trump meet at the Elysee Palace ahead of the international ceremony for the Centenary of the WWI Armistice of Nov. 11, 1918.

(Photo: Christophe Petit Tesson / POOL, EPA-EFE)\n\nJust before Air Force One landed in Paris on Friday night, Trump tweeted criticism of Macron for his European army proposal, and again complained that European partners in the NATO military alliance are not paying enough for their own defense.\n\nThe president is among some 60 world leaders in France to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. In an early morning tweet, Trump said, \"is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?\"\n\nThe bilateral Macron-Trump meeting came a day before celebrations kickoff at the Arc de Triomphe for a ceremony to honor the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nOther World War I ceremonies are taking place throughout France and Europe this week, some involving Trump \u2013 though he canceled a trip Saturday to the Ainse-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial due to what a White House statement called \"scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather.\"\n\nAn American delegation led by Chief of Staff General John Kelly and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford attended the cemetery ceremony instead.\n\nOn Saturday night, the U.S. president and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend a ceremonial dinner at Musee D\u2019Orsay, the former train station turned into an iconic Impressionism art museum on the banks of the Seine river.\n\nDomestic issues are also on the president's mind, less than a week after Democrats won control of the U.S. House in congressional elections on Tuesday, and after Trump dismissed Attorney General Jeff Sessions the next day.\n\nBefore departing for Elysse Palace and his meeting with Macron, Trump tweeted support for his new acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the subject of criticism for his attacks on the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump tweeted complaints about California wildfires, saying the reason is that \"forest management is so poor.\"\n\nWhile Macon has made a priority of getting along with the U.S. president, the French leader has also criticized Trump for pulling out of international agreements, including the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate change accord.\n\nOfficials in Europe have also questioned Trump's desire to befriend Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is threatening other countries and seeking to undermine the western alliance.\n\nIn recent days, Macron criticized Trump's decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), a 1987 arms control deal designed to prohibit Russia from developing mid-range missiles capable of reaching Western European cities.\n\nCLOSE As he departed for Paris Friday morning, President Trump insisted that a White House-released video depicting contact between a staffer and a CNN reporter wasn't altered, and he again attacked a number of journalists, calling one \"a loser.\" (Nov. 9) AP\n\nThat move inspired Macron's call for a European army. In an interview with Europe 1 radio, he said such a force may be needed because \"we have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\u201d\n\nTrump's tweeted response while landing in Paris: \"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nRichard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said Macron's idea is reasonable because Trump has questioned the need for NATO's \"Article 5\" requirement that all members of the alliance will come to the aid of any member that is attacked.\n\nIt \"is not insulting but rather what you get when the Potus raises doubts about NATO\u2019s Article 5, slaps tariffs on allies, calls the EU a foe, cozies up to Putin, signals support for the National Front, and unilaterally breaks w int\u2019l pacts,\" Haass tweeted.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is Trump's self-proclaimed \"America First\" foreign policy, and his claim that he is a \"nationalist.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron greets President Donald Trump upon his arrival at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Saturday.

Most famously, at their first meeting in 2017, Trump and Macron appeared to engage in a macho handshaking contest to determine who could make the toughest grip.\n\nSaturday's handshakes looked brief and pro forma, even as photographers snapped shots of clasped hands.

They need to be stopped once and for all.\n\nMarine Corps Corporal Joaquin Aranda with his military dog Donna in Houston on June 21, 2014. (Photo: Andrew Buckley)\n\nDogs have a long history of military service, dating back to ancient times. Here in the U.S., canines have been used as scouts and trackers and to guard prisoners and deliver messages on the front lines since the Civil War. More recently in Iraq and Afghanistan, these four-legged heroes have employed their remarkable sense of smell to sniff out improvised explosive devices and weapons caches. In fact, these incredible dogs have given us their best. They have put their own lives on the line to protect and defend us.\n\nSo it is at once shocking and inconceivable that the front lines may be safer for dogs than the medical center laboratories of the Veterans Administration. Indeed, the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2014 still striving to recover from massive scandals involving its (mis)treatment of human patients \u2014 is now becoming embroiled in another controversy, this one involving its (mis)treatment of canines.\n\nNews reports published last week in this paper and elsewhere found that the VA is continuing to conduct invasive experiments on dogs as part of its medical research program, experiments that result in the euthanasia of the animals. According to the reports, there are currently nine active experiments at four VA facilities, including in Milwaukee, where researchers are removing parts of the dogs\u2019 brains to test neurons that control breathing prior to killing them by lethal injection, and in Cleveland, where doctors are measuring dogs\u2019 cough reflexes by placing electrodes on their spinal cords. When done, the cords are severed, killing the dogs.\n\nVA maintains that studies on dogs are necessary\n\nSadly, the VA is not alone in using dogs in the name of scientific research. Just as other institutions have defended this practice as critical to medical breakthroughs, officials at the VA maintain that their canine experiments are ethically sound and can lead to discoveries that can positively impact veterans suffering from paralysis, heart ailments and breathing problems. They cite prior studies on dogs that resulted in the invention of an implantable cardiac pacemaker and procedures that led to the first successful liver transplant.\n\nBut that argument holds less water than what fits into a Yorkie\u2019s bowl, because according to the VA\u2019s own website, those discoveries date back more than a half-century to the 1960s.\n\nIn an act of compassion, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation last year to defund the VA\u2019s canine experimentation program, but the measure stalled in the Senate. Nevertheless, earlier this year a federal bill was passed that requires the Secretary of Veteran Affairs to first grant approval before any funding can be allocated to this research. And just prior to his dismissal, Dr. David Shulkin, the then VA Secretary, issued a moratorium on any new experiments moving forward without permission and that all ongoing studies had to go through a formal review process by VA research leadership.\n\nMore: On K9 Veterans Day, honor heroic military working dogs for saving soldiers' lives\n\nFifty years after my military service, a sea change on veterans and war\n\nFormer Navy physician: The VA doesn't need to experiment on dogs\n\nBut these barriers haven\u2019t precluded or impeded the VA from conducting what may be painful and is definitely fatal research on dogs.\n\nPlease know that we are not advocating that all research be prohibited, because as one of us (Lois Pope) has learned from producing a new documentary, \u201cMade for Each Other,\u201d with award-winning filmmaker Ric Burns, there are enormously important groundbreaking studies being conducted at Duke University, using fMRI technology to determine dogs\u2019 cognitive abilities, with the goal of improving the ways they are bred and trained to help humans as service and therapy dogs. Also, because dogs can get the same diseases as humans, scientists at Cornell University are using canine DNA to improve the effectiveness of new immunotherapy treatments for cancer. These are but two examples of dogs being used safely in research that could beneficial to humans.\n\nAmerican Humane, the country\u2019s oldest national humane organization, is supportive of positive prevention studies designed to keep animals and people healthy, and advocating in any work it funds that no animals are harmed, there is no induction of illness or injury, and they are not euthanized.\n\nDogs serve us in so many other ways\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a scientist to know that dogs can and do play an essential role in bettering the lives of all of us, and particularly our military and our veterans. Through our decades of activism and support of animals and disabled veterans alike, we have seen first-hand how dogs provide much needed assistance and therapy for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. They also act as guide and service dogs for veterans who have been blinded or disabled in combat.\n\nWorking side-by-side with the men and women of our armed forces while putting their own lives on the line for our country, military dogs take loyalty to a whole new level through such service. By doing so, they have saved countless thousands of lives.\n\nNow it\u2019s time that we do something to save their lives and those of all our four-footed friends by immediately stopping and banning all harmful VA research involving dogs. We know we\u2019re not barking up the wrong tree in saying that since dogs are our best friends, we can\u2019t be treating them like our enemies.\n\nLois Pope created the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial and championed the establishment of a National Day of Honor for disabled veterans.

He has seen Twitter engagement turn nasty because he is black, but is adamant he does not let it bother him. Nor will he use it as a way to differentiate himself from the rest of the field. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Bubba Wallace does not care about the way things used to be done in NASCAR, and he is not interested in how veterans believe he is supposed to drive.\n\nThe rookie behind the wheel of Richard Petty's iconic No. 43 has already defied odds by becoming the only black driver at NASCAR's top level. Reaching the pinnacle of the sport is just the start of what Wallace hopes to accomplish.\n\n\"I'm different, I'm not like anybody in this sport, and that's not based on skin color,\" Wallace said. \"I have an I-don't-give-a-damn filter, and there are a lot of guys still stuck to an old system that's been the same thing for them the last 20 years. Well, that's boring. That's super boring.\n\n\"I do my own thing and think, 'Why are we doing it this old way still?' Throw the old system out the window. People are afraid of change, but I want to change everything.\"\n\nWallace has two races remaining in a rookie season with a storybook beginning at the Daytona 500. He finished second, the highest ever for a minority in NASCAR's version of the Super Bowl, and it launched Wallace into the national spotlight.\n\nBut Daytona is unlike the bulk of NASCAR's schedule so when the high of Daytona subsided, Wallace found himself trying to keep his head above water. His Richard Petty Motorsports team switched from Ford to Chevrolet during the offseason, aligned with a new team partner and hired a new driver in Wallace. The seat was open because Aric Almirola moved to Stewart-Haas Racing, and primary sponsor Smithfield left with him.\n\nA mid-level team undergoing so much change could not avoid struggling and it's been that way all year for RPM and its eager young driver. The loss of funding has made it feel as if the team is sometimes running uphill.\n\nWallace heads into Sunday's race at ISM Raceway near Phoenix ranked 28th in the Cup standings. He has led 19 laps and had two top-10 finishes, but hasn't been close to a strong finish since Daytona back in February. It's a slow climb and securing funding remains a top priority for Wallace, who was born in Alabama and grew up in suburban Charlotte, the North Carolina home of most NASCAR teams.\n\n\"We are still trying to do the best we can, the goal is still to try to get more sponsorship for the next two years, at least,\" Wallace said. \"I don't know CEOs or company mindsets in how they go about sponsoring, but I'm super competitive and if you only see the results sheet and see how we are running, it's hard for me to show that there is more to it than that. It becomes a challenge to showcase why we are a better fit for some sponsors and a better fit than other teams.\"\n\nThe Air Force is Wallace's sponsor at Phoenix in honor of Veteran's Day. The Air Force has partnered with RPM for 10 consecutive seasons and is typically on the car around patriotic holidays.\n\nWallace has made bonding with his sponsors a priority and has visited four different Air Force bases this year. He has participated in various drills and allowed The Associated Press to accompany him to Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina, where he flew in an F-16 with the 77th Fighter Squadron, known as the \"Gamblers.\" He went through flight training before Maj. Gen. Scott Zobrist led him into the air. Captain Jack Howard, a rookie pilot, flew Wallace's jet, reaching over 9Gs.\n\nIt was an adrenaline rush, even for a driver who has had more than his share of hard crashes this season. Wallace was even disappointed to learn the G forces he and Howard pulled ranked only second on the squadron board for guests.\n\nPushing for the most he can get is the same way Wallace races, and he pointed to a recent race in Dover, Delaware, as an example of how he is an anomaly in NASCAR. Wallace figured he was four laps down in his version of the Dover story during a late restart that put him near the front of the field. Because he wasn't on the lead lap, Wallace said other drivers believed he should move out of their way.\n\nHe refused.\n\n\"After the race you hear all these guys complaining, 'There goes Bubba racing again,'\" Wallace said. \"You are damn right. I am not going to roll over. ... Go race. We aren't here to ride around and put on a dog and pony show. I am not going to layover for you. If you think I was tough to pass, well, sorry bro, drive harder. I'm going as fast as I can.\"\n\nCelebrated for being the rare minority to make it to NASCAR's big leagues, Wallace recognizes that his race will always be as important to some as the way he races. He has seen Twitter engagement turn nasty because he is black, but is adamant he does not let it bother him. Nor will he use it as a way to differentiate himself from the rest of the field.\n\n\"Until we get more drivers of color, the color of my skin is going to be an issue for a long time,\" he said. \"I know I am Bubba Wallace. I don't pull the race card. I've had some haters on Twitter and I will respond back, and then fans quickly go to the race side. I didn't mention that \u2014 this was about me running 30th \u2014 you mentioned race. I'm here to win races and be me. If someone doesn't like me, that's not my problem.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Drew Nash/The Times-News via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Boise State quarterback Brett Rypien etched his name in the Mountain West record books as the conference's all-time leading passer in both yards and completions. But the pro-style passer needed his feet almost as much as his arm to beat the nation's second-best scoring defense.\n\nRypien engineered a fourth-quarter comeback, finishing with 269 yards passing with a touchdown and one interception, along with 30 yards rushing on eight carries that included scrambles for three first downs, in leading Boise State to a 24-17 upset over No. 16 Fresno State on Friday night.\n\n\"(Rypien) ran the ball well tonight,\" Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said. \"He moved and scrambled and all those little plays, they don't seem like much at the time but they add up throughout the game. And that's why we won the game tonight.\"\n\nTrailing 17-10 late in the third quarter, Rypien scrambled on third down for a 10-yard gain to set up a game-tying 1-yard run by Alexander Mattison.\n\nAfter the game, Rypien shrugged off his fleet-footed prowess.\n\n\"It's just me trying to make a play,\" Rypien said. \"There were some third-down situations in there where I felt like their eyes were off me and I had to take off and make a play.\"\n\nEven Fresno State coach Jeff Tedford could only shake his head afterward when recalling Rypien's running plays.\n\n\"They have a good offense and Rypien killed us with his legs a little,\" Tedford said.\n\nRypien's legs complemented his clutch throws, none bigger than a 49-yard scoring strike on another third down play when he hit Khalil Shakir in stride with 9:22 remaining in the fourth quarter to give the Broncos a 24-17 lead.\n\n\"On the touchdown pass, (Rypien) stepped up and slid and delivered a perfect ball in that situation,\" Harsin said. \"With all that was going on, when you can deliver a perfect throw in that moment in a tight ball game \u2014 it takes a lot of hard work for that guy to do that.\"\n\nBoise State (8-2, 5-1 Mountain West), which hasn't lost to Fresno State at home since 1984, beat a ranked team for the first time in November in program history to keep its conference title aspirations alive.\n\nIt was also the first time since 1999 that the Broncos were an underdog at home for a regular season game.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be tough,\" Rypien said. \"Being an underdog on the blue, that's never a good feeling, especially since we haven't been in a long time. And some guys in the locker room took that kind of personally.\"\n\nMattison rushed for 144 yards on 30 carries and two touchdowns, the most any single running back has tallied against the Bulldogs' this season.\n\nFresno State (8-2, 5-1) had only given up three touchdowns in conference play before facing the Broncos and had only been in one game decided by one score or less all season.\n\nFollowing another bitter loss to the Broncos, Tedford remained upbeat.\n\n\"We'll bounce back,\" Tedford said. \"Our guys played hard right down to the end. I've still got a lot of confidence in this team.\"\n\nFresno State Marcus McMaryion, who struggled against Boise State in the Mountain West title game last December, was 24-of-35 passing with a touchdown. However, McMaryion couldn't pull off any late-game heroics after the Bulldogs fell behind, as the Broncos held Fresno State on its final two drives before running out the clock to secure the victory.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nFresno State: The Bulldogs' faint hopes to emerge from the Group of 5 and earn a berth in a New Year's Six bowl dimmed with the loss. However, they still have a chance to win the West division and get back to the conference title game.\n\nBoise State: With the season hanging in the balance, the Broncos showed they have the fortitude to do what it takes to win close games for the second straight week. The Broncos still have plenty of work to do in order to get an opportunity to defend their conference title, including a home date in two weeks against Mountain division leader No. 14 Utah State.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nFresno State will fall after the close loss on the road, but not far enough to drop out of the poll altogether. Boise State, which hasn't been ranked since the third week of the season, might have a chance to crack the top 25 again with some help on Saturday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFresno State: The Bulldogs return home Saturday to face San Diego State with a berth in the conference title game on the line.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos will travel to New Mexico on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Kings coach Dave Joerger didn't like most of what he saw from his team in the first half against Minnesota.\n\nThe second half was an entirely different story and had Joerger beaming afterward, even though Sacramento nearly blew a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nWillie Cauley-Stein had 25 points, Nemanja Bjelica scored eight in a row during a big run late in the third and the Kings beat the slumping Timberwolves 121-110 on Friday night to spoil a huge game for Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\n\"I didn't think we played very well in the first half and still had a two-point lead,\" Joerger said. \"We're growing. This is a very good win for us. I think you saw maybe we wore them down a little bit in the second half.\"\n\nComing off back-to-back losses to East powers Milwaukee and Toronto, the Kings led by 15 early in the fourth but had to hold off a late surge by Minnesota to end a three-game losing streak to the Timberwolves.\n\nSacramento's high-tempo offense was pivotal on both ends, as Minnesota eventually got tired in the second half.\n\n\"We just keep running,\" De'Aaron Fox said. \"Even if they score, we're not worried about that. We're getting the ball up and down the court.\"\n\nFox had 16 points and 10 assists for Sacramento. Iman Shumpert scored 17 and Bjelica finished with 14 points and eight rebounds.\n\nTowns had a season-high 39 points and 19 rebounds on a night when Minnesota's inconsistent offense sputtered.\n\n\"To win you have to play with a certain intensity level and we're not playing well right now,\" coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"It's not any one particular person. It's not any one particular thing. It's all things.

Butler was a game-time decision but played 41 minutes and had 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n\nThe Timberwolves are 0-8 on the road.\n\n\"We just didn't play transitional defense,\" Towns said. \"That's what we need to do. That's why we get hit with another 'L' on this trip and haven't found a way to win.\"\n\nSacramento missed 11 of its first 14 shots and fell behind by 12 early in the first quarter. Cauley-Stein helped rally the Kings in the second, scoring eight points as Sacramento took a 63-61 halftime lead.\n\nTowns made his first five shots and was 7 of 9 in the first quarter as Minnesota jumped out to a 12-point lead. He cooled off a bit in the second but made two 3s and had 29 points and eight rebounds by halftime.\n\nDELAYS, DELAYS\n\nThe first half ended on a strange note when the Kings were called for two fouls with 0.6 seconds left, both coming as Minnesota tried to inbound the ball.

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Long road trips can be daunting for any team, yet the Minnesota Wild are making it look easy.\n\nThe Wild, who are on a franchise-record, seven-game trek, got their fourth win in six stops, defeating the Anaheim Ducks 5-1 on Friday night.\n\nMinnesota got two goals and an assist from Mikael Granlund as it won its ninth in its last 11.\n\n\"We're playing good right now. We're playing much better with the puck,\" said Granlund, who leads the team with nine goals and has eight points (four goals, four assists) during the road trip. \"We got a couple goals. It was one of those games where we found a lot of space.\"\n\nMinnesota, which defeated Los Angeles 4-1 on Thursday, had a 43-21 advantage in shots as it dominated throughout. Coach Bruce Boudreau said Friday's game ranks up there with his club's best game this season.\n\n\"I was a little worried about the first period because I thought they would come out knowing we played last night really hard and it was the opposite. We took it right to them and took their spirit away,\" Boudreau said.\n\nJason Zucker, Jonas Brodin and Jordan Greenway also scored for the Wild. Alex Stalock stopped 20 shots for his third win of the season.\n\nPontus Aberg had the Ducks' goal, and John Gibson made 38 saves. Coach Randy Carlyle said his team was flat, but his players were more direct.\n\n\"It was just embarrassing. There's really nothing to break down,\" left wing Andrew Cogliano said.\n\nCaptain Ryan Getzlaf said the Ducks lacked mental focus and added \"we were losing pucks everywhere. Everything was going off the toe, and that's up top.\"\n\nThe Wild opened the scoring less than two minutes into the contest when Joel Eriksson Ek was able to keep possession of the puck along the boards before finding Greenway in front of the Ducks' goal for his second of the season.\n\nZucker and Granlund's goals four minutes apart in the second were scored in the same fashion, with each getting great feeds from behind the net. Granlund didn't face any pressure behind the net three minutes into the period when he passed it to Zucker, who fired it under Gibson's pads for his second. Granlund then scored his team-leading eighth when he was able to get it under Gibson's glove on a pass from Zucker.\n\nAberg put Anaheim on the board with his fifth in his last seven games. The Ducks were on the power play when Hampus Lindholm found Aberg in the right faceoff circle as the left wing then fired it past Stalock. It was Anaheim's first goal with the man advantage in its last 16 chances.\n\nBrodin put the Wild back up by three goals midway through the third when he fired one into the top corner of the net for his third. Ganlund completed the scoring when he was able to take advantage of a rebound off Gibson.\n\nNOTES: It is the first time Minnesota has won both games of a back-to-back set this season. ... Greenway has two goals and two assists on the road trip. ... Minnesota had a 19-5 shots advantage during the first period. ... It is the seventh time Anaheim has allowed 40 shots or more. It came into the game allowing a league-worst 36.5 shots per game. ...

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Gordon Hayward got a cold reception in Utah. He was booed every time he touched the ball, and his Boston Celtics left town with a loss.\n\nJoe Ingles matched his career high with 27 points and added a season-best seven assists to help the Jazz beat the Celtics 123-115 on Friday night in Hayward's return to Salt Lake City.\n\nHayward had 13 points and seven assists in 25 minutes during his first game back in Utah since leaving the Jazz as a free agent to sign with the Celtics after the 2016-17 season. He broke his left ankle in Boston's opener last season.\n\nThe star forward spent his first seven NBA seasons with the Jazz after they drafted him ninth overall in 2010. He averaged 15.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists for Utah, but took the hostile reaction from Jazz fans in stride.\n\n\"I kind of expected some of that,\" Hayward said. \"They were booing me from the get-go, so it's part of the game.\"\n\nBoston trimmed a 20-point deficit to four by the fourth quarter.

I think over the past couple of games, we've done that.\"\n\nTerry Rozier scored a season-high 22 points, making his first start in place of Irving, and Jayson Tatum added 21 for the Celtics.\n\nBoston lost for the third time in four games after allowing Utah to shoot a season-high 56 percent from the field.\n\n\"As good as we were defensively in the first nine games, I don't think we've been as good the last three,\" coach Brad Stevens said. \"I thought we actually did an OK job on the initial drives in isolation, but we didn't get rebounds in a lot of cases. Our pick-and-roll defense, we just have to really shore it up.\"\n\nThe Jazz started to pull away when they hit 3-pointers on each of their final four possessions of the second quarter to take a 58-51 halftime lead. Ingles accounted for the first three long-distance baskets, highlighting a 20-point first half for him.\n\nUtah opened the third quarter on a 17-6 run. Mitchell ignited the spurt by draining three free throws and driving for a layup on back-to-back possessions. Derrick Favors kept it going with back-to-back baskets that gave the Jazz a double-digit lead and finished the run off with a pair of free throws that put Utah ahead 75-57 just four minutes into the quarter.\n\n\"Defensively, we didn't pay attention to details,\" Rozier said. \"We just didn't have a presence out there, so they played freely.\"\n\nThe Jazz built their lead to 83-63 on a layup by Crowder before Boston rallied in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Celtics scored on four straight possessions, culminating in Tatum's layup, to ignite a 15-4 run.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) \u2014 Maryland's shots were clanging off the rim, and suddenly the Terrapins found themselves in a tie game with Navy.\n\nTime to crank up the defense.\n\nMaryland limited the Midshipmen to six baskets over the final 14\u00bd minutes and pulled away to a 78-57 victory Friday night.\n\nAnthony Cowan scored 24 points and Darryl Morsell added 15 for the Terrapins, who won despite never really getting into a solid groove offensively.\n\n\"I was proud of my guys tonight. We really played well the last 14 minutes or so,\" coach Mark Turgeon said. \"We were great defensively.\"\n\nMorsell made two free throws to put Maryland (2-0) in front for good, 41-39, and Cowan buried a 3 to give the Terrapins a bit of separation.\n\nMinutes later, Morsell had a dunk and a layup in a 10-3 spree that made it 54-44.\n\nDespite going 5 for 23 from 3-point range, Maryland outscored Navy 23-12 at the foul line and forced 17 turnovers.\n\nSooner or later, the youthful Terps will find their shot. Until then, they're going to try to win by playing hard on the other end of the court.\n\n\"We haven't shot the ball well these first two games, but we're still locked in defensively,\" Morsell said. \"It shows a lot about this team. When we start hitting shots, it's going to be fun. That's all I can say.\"\n\nCam Davis scored 12 for the Midshipmen (0-2), who ultimately couldn't keep up with the faster, taller Terrapins.\n\nIn the opener of the fifth annual Veteran's Classic, Wichita State beat Providence 83-80. The nightcap was competitive well into the second half.\n\nNavy returned from halftime with a 7-0 run to close to 33-32, causing Turgeon to call a timeout with just over two minutes elapsed.\n\n\"The biggest thing we had going for us was energy,\" Davis said. \"When we came out at halftime, we did everything we needed to do.\"\n\nNot long after that, however, the Terrapins finally pulled away.\n\n\"We wouldn't figure out the zone, so we just spread it out and drove it because we couldn't make a shot,\" Turgeon said.\n\nMaryland led 33-25 at halftime despite a 10-for-32 shooting performance that included 12 misfires from beyond the arc.\n\nNavy missed 10 of its first 11 shots and fell behind 16-6. Soon after that, the Terrapins' shooting touch went awry, too.\n\nThe Midshipmen were fortunate to be within striking range after going 7 for 26 from the floor with nine turnovers.\n\nADMIRAL IN THE HOUSE\n\nFormer Navy star David Robinson was in attendance and introduced to the sellout crowd during the first half.\n\nPrior to this game, the last time Maryland faced Navy on the basketball court was in the second round of the 1985 NCAA Tournament, when Len Bias and the Terps bested Robinson and Navy 64-59.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMaryland: The Terrapins are 2-0 and haven't looked good in either victory. Fortunately, they've got plenty of time to grow and work out the kinks with a succession of home games against lesser foes before hosting Virginia on Nov. 28.\n\nNavy: Playing out of their league, literally, the Midshipmen didn't have the height or talent to match up against a Big Ten foe. Fortunately for Navy, the competition in the Patriot League is not quite as formidable.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMaryland: The Terrapins host North Carolina A&T on Monday night, the first of six consecutive home games through Dec. 1.\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen host another Maryland school, Coppin State, on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Skara is showing he can score, too.\n\nSkara had 16 points and No. 22 Clemson opened a large early lead in cruising to a 71-51 victory over North Carolina Central on Friday night.\n\nIt was Skara's second consecutive game in double figures after doing it just once in 26 contests last season.\n\n\"Last year I struggled a bit offensively,\" said Skara, who averaged only 3.3 points per game a year ago. \"This year I feel a lot more comfortable. The shots are coming. My teammates are finding me and that helps to get my confidence up.\"\n\nBrownell said Skara, a 6-foot-8 transfer who played his first two seasons at Valparaiso, simply wanted to blend in with last season's talented team and not step on any toes.\n\n\"David's such a good guy that the last thing he wants to do is upset the apple cart,\" Brownell said.\n\nThis time around, Skara has been more assertive in looking for his shot. He's made nine of 14 field goal attempts and four 3-pointers in two games.\n\n\"He felt (last year) he was a much better player,\" Brownell said.\n\nThat was apparent against the Eagles (0-1). Skara made two of Clemson's eight straight baskets to start the game as the Tigers (2-0) opened a 23-11 advantage about eight minutes in and quickly took control of this matchup between 2018 NCAA Tournament teams.\n\nWhile the Tigers reached the Sweet 16, Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Tournament champion North Carolina Central lost to Texas Southern in a First Four matchup.\n\nNCCU coach LeVelle Moton said his team made too many mental mistakes early and was moving too slow to hang with a Top 25 opponent.

The Eagles trailed 40-20 at halftime.\n\nRaasean Davis, the Eagles' leading scorer at 15 points per game last season, was held to four on 2-of-5 shooting in the opening period.\n\nHe finished with 14 points, and Zaccary Douglas had 12.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nNCCU: The Eagles will do a lot of flying the next couple of weeks with trips to Cincinnati, Bowling Green and George Mason. North Carolina Central hopes the rough opening schedule will make it ready when Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference play starts.\n\nClemson: The Tigers came out fast and did what they needed to take control of the game.

They caused some of the penalties, because we were antsy to get out of our stance.\"\n\nNeal scored from two yards out following an interception by linebacker Kielan Whitner.\n\nAndre Szmyt hit field goals of 39 and 35 yards following two more Cardinal mistakes.\n\nThe win was the fourth straight for the surging Orange while Louisville lost its seventh straight. The eight wins tied the most victories for Syracuse in a regular season since 1998.\n\nDungey was 14 of 27 for 192 yards and gained 62 yards on the ground. His rushing touchdowns gave him 12 for the season.\n\nLouisville's three quarterbacks were a combined 14 of 31 for 210 yards.\n\nRECORD BREAKER:\n\nPlacekicker Andre Szmyt's 18 points makes him Syracuse's single-season scoring leader with 132.

The largest crowd of the season \u2014 42,797 \u2014 turned out for Senior Night.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals head home for their final two games of the year, but the season is lost. Big changes loom for the Cardinals and the future of coach Bobby Petrino is very much in doubt.\n\nSyracuse: These are great times for Orange football. Six wins and a bowl game would have been considered a successful season, but Syracuse now has loftier goals. Next Saturday's matchup against No. 3 Notre Dame is the program's biggest game in years, and the Orange's high-powered offense gives them a chance for an upset.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals host North Carolina State on Saturday. The No. 22 Wolfpack will be smarting from their loss to Wake Forest.\n\nSyracuse: The Orange travel to Yankee Stadium on Saturday to play Notre Dame in a game that will go a long way in determining Syracuse's \u2014 and Notre Dame's \u2014 postseason destination.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Blue Jackets won 2-1. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Columbus Blue Jackets are finally starting to feel confident on the power play, and that could be dangerous for the rest of the NHL.\n\nColumbus' league-worst power play scored twice and Sergei Bobrovsky made 33 saves in a 2-1 victory over the defending Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals on Friday night.\n\nOliver Bjorkstrand scored in his return to the lineup and Anthony Duclair had his seventh goal of the season for the Blue Jackets, who have three power-play goals during their two-game winning streak.\n\n\"We're working as a five-man unit,\" said Duclair, who scored from a sharp angle to tie Artemi Panarin for the team lead with seven goals. \"We know the type of skill of talent we have on both units, and if we just put the work into it, I think they're going to start going in.\"\n\nThe Blue Jackets entered the night 7 of 59 on the power play, an 11.9 percent conversion rate that was last among the league's 31 teams. After his penalty kill went 4 for 5 against Washington, coach John Tortorella pointed out Columbus has kept its head above water with shaky special teams and could finally develop some consistency if those units round into form.\n\nBobrovsky is certainly there. The 2013 and 2017 Vezina Trophy winner was far more dialed in Friday than during the first round last spring against the Capitals when Columbus blew a 2-0 series lead.\n\nThe Russian goaltender who can be a free agent after the season was at his best early in making 15 first-period saves and then late on two third-period penalty kills that helped the Blue Jackets win in regulation and take over sole possession of first place in the Metropolitan Division.\n\n\"I felt pretty good again,\" said Bobrovsky, who faced 34 shots and never looked out of a play. \"I know that the Washington is a really good team, and if you relax too, too much they're going to score a goal right away. So, you have to respect them and compete against them. It's so much fun to beat them.\"\n\nCaptain Nick Foligno thought the Blue Jackets respected the Capitals too much, sitting back and leaning on Bobrovsky to win them the game. He allowed only a power-play goal to Matt Niskanen, who was wide open when he blasted home a shot from the point.\n\nWashington's Braden Holtby, who won the Vezina Trophy in 2016, was on top of his game in stopping 34 of the 36 shots he faced. The Capitals' two-game winning streak came to an end, but they haven't allowed an even-strength goal in their past three.\n\n\"Right now, we just can't seem to kill a penalty,\" Niskanen said. \"In a tight game, that hurts.\"\n\nBjorkstrand rewarded Tortorella for putting him on the top line and the power play in place of right wing Cam Atkinson, who missed the game with an illness. Niskanen scored his goal from the point on Washington's top power-play unit in place of defenseman John Carlson, who's listed as day-to-day with lower-body injury.\n\nNOTES: Referee Brad Meier left in the first period after losing an edge and appearing to twist his right knee. Meier needed help getting off the ice, and the NHL said he had a lower-body injury. The game finished with three officials. ...

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Louisville coach Jeff Walz was scrambling to find games to fill his schedule after a December tournament was unexpectedly cancelled. Chattanooga had an opening, but Mocs coach Katie Burrows insisted on playing on her team's home court.\n\nThe experience benefited both.\n\nAsia Durr scored 24 points as the fifth-ranked Cardinals, opening the season with five games away from home, used another third-quarter burst to pull away and beat Chattanooga 75-49 on Friday night.\n\n\"I think it's good. I've never been a big fan of buying a bunch of home games because I think coming to places like this is good for our game,\" Walz said. \"And then I want to find out how my kids can handle being on the road, what their mentality is going to be. It's easy to play at home when 10,000 people are cheering for you.\"\n\nAfter a closely played first half, Louisville (2-0) outscored Chattanooga 30-10 in the third quarter to take control. In their season-opening win at Western Kentucky, the Cardinals outscored WKU 31-8 in the third quarter.\n\nBionca Dunham scored 12 points for Louisville while Sam Fuehring had eight. Louisville assisted on 21 of its 28 made field goals.\n\nDurr, who scored 33 points against Western Kentucky, shot 7 for 14 from the field \u2014 including 5 for 0 on 3-pointers \u2014 against Chattanooga. It was the senior guard's 39th game with at least 20 points.\n\nLakelyn Bouldin finished with 11 points for Chattanooga (1-1), which shot 31.4 percent from the field (16 of 51).\n\n\"I can't make that little round thing go through the basket. I wish I could. I wish I could telepathically make it do what I wanted it to do,\" Burrows said. \"But these girls against a team like (Louisville) \u2014 bigger, faster, stronger \u2014 they make you speed up a little bit because they will come at you hard and close out on you hard, so you have to get that shot off a little bit quicker.\"\n\nBoth teams struggled shooting from the start, combining to go 3 for 23 through the first four minutes. Bouldin gave Chattanooga an offensive spark by banking in a hook shot and making a 3-pointer from the corner to give the Mocs an 11-7 lead.\n\nFueled by turnovers and Durr's scoring, Louisville went on a a run to end the half. The senior guard hit a 3-pointer and finished a layup on the break to give the Cardinals a 28-20 lead.\n\nLouisville came out of the halftime break with renewed energy on defense and quickly built their lead. The Cardinals started the third quarter on an 8-0 run, and never looked back. Durr made back-to-back 3s to give Louisville a 51-27 lead, and capped the third quarter with a 40-foot shot at the buzzer.\n\n\"We just really talked about pushing the tempo and trying to create as many scoring opportunities as we could and I thought we did a really nice job of that,\" Walz said of the third-quarter run. \"We ran the floor and got two layups from our post players right out of the gate, which kind of opened things up for everybody else.\"\n\nAfter busing home for a short break, Louisville travels to play at Boise State on Nov. 19 before heading straight to Las Vegas for games against No. 23 Arizona State and Hartford at the Southpoint Shootout.\n\nDurr is glad to have been pushed by the Mocs early to help prepare for the future.\n\n\"Chattanooga made some great plays. They had some great players and went on some great runs. They made us work,\" Durr said. \"We will go back and watch this film to see what we can take from it and become better.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals need to find ways to score in the half-court when Durr isn't. Louisville struggled to generate points in the first half while Durr was contained by Chattanooga's defense or sitting on the bench. Louisville's pressure defense helped alleviate the problem in the second half by getting points in transition.\n\nChattanooga: In their first big test under new coach Katie Burrows, the Mocs weren't afraid and hung with Louisville through the first half. But Louisville's pressure finally wore Chattanooga down. The experience will serve the Mocs well the remainder of the season against less-heralded opponents.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nChattanooga outshot Louisville 52-51, but Louisville made 28 field goals, including eight 3-pointers. Chattanooga hung with Louisville on the boards, getting outrebounded only 35-29.\n\nCLOSER TO HOME\n\nThe trip to Chattanooga was a bit of a homecoming for Louisville assistant coach Sam Purcell. He was born in Dalton, Georgia, which is 35 miles away from Chattanooga.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLouisville: At Boise State on Nov. 19.\n\nChattanooga: At Hampton on Nov. 16.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Zaquavian Smith had 17.\n\nSavannah State, playing only its third game against in-state rival Georgia, and its first since 2005, tested the Bulldogs by setting a fast pace. The Tigers, who led the nation in 3-point attempts and 12.2 3-pointers per game last season, continued their relentless long-range attack against Georgia.\n\n\"I've never played a team that shot the ball like that,\" Crump said. \"We expected it, but I've never seen it like that in my life.\"\n\nCrump said Crean remained calm when Georgia's lead began to shrink in the second half.\n\nCrump said Crean's message was \"keep fighting, execute the offense. Everything will take care of itself.\"\n\nCrean has promised the Bulldogs also will spread the floor and rely heavily on 3s \u2014 though not at Savannah State's pace. Georgia made 11 of 27 3s.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSavannah State: The Tigers rely on 3-pointers, and the results can be ugly when the shots aren't falling. Savannah State missed its first 12 shots from the field, including eight 3-pointers, while falling behind 14-0.\n\nGeorgia: The Bulldogs spread the floor and opened room for inside baskets early, including on back-to-back jams by Claxton to open the game. There was ample evidence the Georgia players are still learning Crean's offense. Bad passes played a big role in 23 turnovers.\n\nSTRONG START\n\nGeorgia's 59 first-half points were its most in a half since scoring 60 in the second half against Jacksonville State on Nov. 9, 2007, also a season-opener.\n\nCAREER HIGHS\n\nClaxton posted his first career double-double while setting career highs for points and rebounds.

(AP) \u2014 Three of the veterans that led Kansas State to the Elite Eight last season spent the past week shuffling in and out of practice, each of them dealing with a nagging early season injury.\n\nBarry Brown and Dean Wade were good enough to play against Kennesaw State on Friday night.\n\nXavier Sneed wound up sitting out the game.\n\nMost of the way, the No. 12 Wildcats could have used him.\n\nIt wasn't until Brown and Wade helped to trigger a run midway through the second half that Kansas State finally established a comfortable cushion. Brown finished with 15 points and Wade added 13 as the Wildcats persevered for a 56-41 victory in their season opener.\n\n\"We were our worst enemy when it came to missing a layup, making a turnover,\" Wildcats coach Bruce Weber said. \"I hope they left with a sour taste in their mouth and come back and practice better tomorrow, but it's good that we made some plays at the end.\"\n\nMakol Mawien added 15 points and Austin Trice had 12 rebounds in his debut for the Wildcats, who led just 31-27 at halftime before leaning on their stingy defense to go on that late run.\n\nIt was enough to help the Wildcats win their 24th consecutive non-conference game at Bramlage Coliseum even without Sneed, who sprained his ankle in practice and was held out as a precaution.\n\n\"If we were playing Kansas tonight,\" Weber said, \"he's playing. We just have a big stretch coming up, Monday and then going to the Virgin Islands. We all felt it was better to rest him.\"\n\nKosta Jankovic had 10 points to lead the Owls (1-1), who committed 21 turnovers and were no match athletically for their Big 12 foe. Kansas State had a 42-12 edge inside and 24-4 in transition.\n\n\"I mean, shooting 1 for 13 from 3 isn't good,\" Wade said of the Wildcats' offensive struggles, \"but it starts with defense. You get a couple stops, some easy layups, it gets everybody's confidence up. It all starts on the defensive end.\"\n\nStill, the Wildcats probably could have used Sneed most of the way.\n\nWade was trapped and double-teamed inside throughout the first half, rendering him mostly ineffective, and nobody else could execute well in the half-court. That left the Wildcats' offense to come almost entirely on the fast break, where Brown proved most successful at running the court.\n\nTrice also got into the act early, making a highlight play by blocking Kennesaw State's Pietro Agostini and taking the rebound to the other end for a scooping layup.\n\nBut otherwise, the Wildcats scraped and clawed their way through the first 20 minutes.\n\nMost of their second 20 wasn't a whole lot better.\n\nKennesaw State answered every time Kansas State tried to go on a run, and Kyle Clarke bookended a basket by Tyler Hooker to get the Owls within 41-37 with 9 \u00bd minutes to go.\n\nCartier Diarra finally sparked the Wildcats by taking a run-out, spinning in the lane and getting a layup to go. Wade added a putback, Mawien converted in the paint and Brown scored on yet another fast break as the Wildcats ripped off eight straight points to take a 49-37 lead.\n\nKansas State slowly added to its advantage in the closing minutes.\n\n\"Like our coaches said in the locker room, we still won,\" Brown said. \"We're 1-0 right now and that's all that really matters.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nKennesaw State: The Owls proved they can hang tough for 30 minutes, but the Wildcats' superior depth began to show in the second half. Kennesaw State also hurt its upset bid with a series of sloppy turnovers, including four in a span of just a few minutes in the second half.\n\nKansas State: Diarra and Kamau Stokes, the Wildcats' two primary ball handlers, were shut out in the first half. Each finished with two points, going a combined 2 for 10 from the floor, putting some extra pressure on the rest of the team to score.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKennesaw State: Visits Samford on Monday night.\n\nKansas State: Plays Denver at Bramlage Coliseum on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college basketball: http://collegebasketball.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 St. Louis Blues goalie Chad Johnson swears he wasn't in a special zone or mindset. The San Jose Sharks might disagree.\n\nJohnson made 33 saves for his first shutout with St. Louis, helping the Blues beat the Sharks 4-0 on Friday night.\n\n\"I don't really think about being locked in or on,\" Johnson said. \"I don't think about how I feel. You kind of go out there. You prepare. I prepare the same way every day. I just try to feel the same way or not feel at all.\"\n\nAlex Pietrangelo, Ryan O'Reilly, Jaden Schwartz, and Alexander Steen scored. The Blues have won four of five games after winning just two of their first eight to start the season.\n\n\"We're rolling four lines good,\" Pietrangelo said. \"We're using everybody in every situation. There just seems to be good jumps, so when every line is getting out there, it seems like there's a lot of energy.\"\n\nJohnson started just his third game of the season, but his second straight. He improved to 2-2-0 with his first shutout since November 2016 with the Calgary Flames.\n\n\"We've kind of been leaving our goalies out to dry,\" Pietrangelo said. \"They'll make the first save. It's our job to take care of the second ones. We're doing a great job right now taking care of them.\"\n\nPietrangelo roofed a shot past goalie Aaron Dell with both teams down a man to open the scoring in the first period. Dell allowed four goals on 31 shots to fall to 1-2-2.\n\n\"It's been horrible,\" Sharks center Logan Couture said about the team's defense. \"It's not just the d-men, it's forwards. It's not good. It's not good enough in American League level. It's ugly right now.\"\n\nSan Jose lost its second consecutive game and was shutout for the second time this season.\n\n\"The last two games haven't been good,\" Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said. \"We're not going to make more out of it than it is. We were playing some pretty good hockey up until the last two games.\"\n\nIn the second period, O'Reilly buried a feed from Jaden Schwartz for his team-leading eighth goal of the season to give him points in a career-best nine consecutive games. He is the first St. Louis player to register a nine-game point streak in his first season with the team since Doug Weight accomplished the feat Oct. 4-25, 2001.\n\n\"He does the right thing in his preparation,\" Blues coach Mike Yeo said. \"He's working hard. He's prepared. Mentally and physically he's prepared to play the game.\"\n\nLater in the second, Schwartz snapped a four-game scoring drought when he beat Dell on a pass from Tyler Bozak for his second goal of the season.\n\nSteen scored his fourth of the season 12:21 into the third period to push the St. Louis lead to 4-0.\n\nSt. Louis failed to convert on four power play opportunities snapping a streak of six straight games with a power play goal.\n\nNOTES:\n\nBlues RW Vladimir Tarasenko extended his points streak to a season-best six games (four goals, four assists). ...

Indiana won 80-35. (AP Photo/AJ Mast) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Indiana coach Archie Miller watched his team put on another defensive clinic Friday night.\n\nIf the Hoosiers keep it up, there's no telling how much better they could be this season.\n\nJuwan Morgan had 14 points, 11 rebounds and three assists, Justin Smith added 13 points to help the Hoosiers roll past Montana State 80-35 \u2014 the second-fewest points Indiana has ever allowed at Assembly Hall.\n\n\"Our defense has to be a quick, tenacious defense that flies around,\" Miller said. \"We don't have a lot of size but we have length, we have speed and we have a lot of it.\"\n\nThe Bobcats (0-2) found out the hard way as they lost their ninth straight.\n\nMiller kept trying to send his defense-first message last season, getting mixed results in his first season with the Hoosiers.\n\nNow, though, players seem to have embraced the philosophy. Indiana has given up just 90 points and eight 3-pointers in its first two games while allowing opponents to shoot 28.7 percent from the field and forcing 45 turnovers.\n\nIt marked the first time since an 80-37 victory over Morehead State in December 1978 that any opponent failed to score at least 40 points on the Hoosiers' home court and only Notre Dame, which lost 94-29 in the first game ever played at Assembly Hall on Dec. 18, 1971, finished with fewer points.\n\nThe timing couldn't be better, either.\n\nAfter starting 2-0 for the 10th time in 11 seasons, the young Hoosiers have four days to prepare for their first serious test against Marquette, a team Miller called one of the best offensive teams in the country.\n\nIndiana is eager to see how it measures up.\n\n\"We try to not play down to and we try not to play up the competition. We try to stay at a steady level,\" Morgan said. \"I think just going through it in practice, making the practices harder than games, I think they will be ready.\n\nThey certainly came to play Friday, turning the game into an early blowout.\n\nThe Hoosiers broke to an 8-2 lead, extended the margin to 24-12 and put it away with a 10-0 run that made it 36-13 late in the first half. Montana State missed 10 straight shots during the stretch.\n\nNot enough? Indiana opened the second half by scoring the first eight points to make it 51-19, steadily extending the lead to as much as 47.\n\nKeljin Blevins was the only Montana State player to score in double figures \u2014 he finished with 13 \u2014 but coach Brian Fish thought his undermanned team did the best it could.\n\n\"They played good (defense), but I like some of the shots we got and they didn't go down,\" he said. \"But I think they had a lot to do with that and we can learn from it.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMontana State: The Bobcats couldn't match Indiana's size, strength or depth and it showed. But the road should get a little easier for Montana State.\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers cruised, as expected, on a night the highly-touted freshman class was mostly held in check. Still Indiana demonstrated how much progress it's made under Miller.\n\nSTAT PACK\n\nMontana State: The Bobcats have lost their first two games by 30 and 55 points. ... They had 25 turnovers and were 14 of 55 from the field and 3 of 26 on 3-pointers. ...

It's more of an underlying effect that's causing him some pain.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMontana State looks to end its skid Sunday when Presentation College, an NAIA school, visits Bozeman.\n\nIndiana welcomes Marquette to Bloomington on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Naz Reid and Tremont Waters came through big on the offensive end for No. 23 LSU. The Tigers needed all of their production to hold off North Carolina-Greensboro.\n\nReid scored 29 points and Waters had 21 points and 10 assists as LSU beat North Carolina-Greensboro 97-91 Friday night.\n\nThe Tigers (2-0) led by 16 points with seven minutes remaining in the game, but they needed to withstand a late rally by the Spartans. UNC-Greensboro went on a 22-11 run to pull to 93-88 with 13 seconds to play.\n\nSkylar Mays and Waters each made a pair of foul shots in the final seconds to preserve the victory for LSU. The Tigers made 28 of 31 foul shots in the game. Ja'vonte Smart joined Reid and Waters in double figures for the Tigers with 13 points.\n\n\"The two things that saved us obviously were our rebounding and making more free throws than they attempted,\" LSU coach Will Wade said. \"It's really tough to win when you give up 19 3s and turn the ball over 17 times. It is also hard to score 97 points when you turn it over like that. Give our guys credit.\"\n\nGreensboro made 19 shots from behind the 3-point line, including 13 in the second half. That outside shooting enabled the Spartans to cut into a sizeable LSU advantage. Kyrin Galloway made four 3-pointers in this stretch to spark the Spartans rally.\n\nLSU came up with a couple of stops in the final seconds. Then, both Skylar Mays and Waters sank a pair of foul shots to preserve the victory for LSU. The Tigers made 28 of 31 foul shots in the game.\n\nGalloway finished with a career-high 32 points for Greensboro (1-1). Francis Alonso added 20 points, while Isaiah Miller had 13 and Demetrius Troy 11.\n\n\"LSU proposed a lot of challenges on the defensive end of the floor,\" Greensboro coach Wes Miller said. \"I was happy with the way we shot the ball from 3 and some of the shots we created with our offense. You make 19 3s and lose tells you that you're not doing things defensively and rebounding.\"\n\nLSU trailed for most of opening 11 minutes. Alonso scored eight points to help Greensboro move out to an 11-5 lead. LSU stayed within striking distance of the Spartans and tied the score at 23 on a basket by Kavell Bigby-Williams with 9:35 remaining before halftime.\n\nAfter a 3-pointer by Alonso put Greensboro ahead 27-25, the Tigers answered with 12 consecutive points. A three-point play by Mays gave LSU the lead at 30-27. Reid's 3 capped the 12-0 run and put the Tigers on top 37-27 with 5:05 remaining in the first half.\n\n\"That run was really big for us,\" Reid said. \"We just need to get more stops. That is something we will work on more. I didn't really realize how well I was shooting. My teammates did a good job getting me the ball and I was able to put it in the basket for them.\"\n\nLSU added on to its advantage over the final minutes of the opening half. Waters converted a three-point play and Marlon Taylor made a 3 to help the Tigers go ahead 49-36 at the half.\n\nHOT SHOOTING\n\nLSU was quite accurate all night against the Spartans. The Tigers shot 56 percent from the field (30 for 54), including 50 percent on 3-pointers (9-of-18). LSU made its first 22 free throw attempts before Emmitt Williams missed one with 2:39 remaining in the game. The Tigers made 90 percent of their foul shots (28 of 31). Mays was the only Tigers player who did not make at least 50 percent of his field goal attempts.\n\nSWAPPING ROLES\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Reid made four of his six shots from behind the 3-point line. The 5-11 Waters made only two 3s. Waters was able to get to the rim against the Greensboro defense. Waters was 5 for 7 at the foul line. Waters' 10 assists were one shy of his career-high which came last season against Arkansas.\n\nCAREER NIGHT\n\nAlonso, who scored 23 points in the Spartans' season-opening victory against North Carolina A&T, had a productive game against LSU. Alonso shot 7 for 12 from the field, including 5 for 9 on 3s, as he scored 20 points. But, it was Galloway, who led the Greensboro comeback. Galloway scored 25 of his 32 points after halftime. Galloway made eight of his 10 3-point shots. Galloway had never made more than two 3-pointers in a game. He had never scored more than 15 points for the Spartans.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLSU: The Tigers have opened the season with victories against two mid-major teams who won conference championships last season. LSU defeat Southeastern Louisiana, which won the Southland Conference title, in its first game. Greensboro won the Southern Conference championship last season.\n\nUNC Greensboro: The Spartans fell behind by double digits late in the first half, but they made things close in the final minutes due to their 3-point shooting.

Just play basketball. I even had jitters myself.\"\n\nLast year, Texas played in 17 games that were decided in the final minute or overtime. They were 8-9 in those games, and that became an offseason focus - changing the outcome of those games.\n\n\"We've emphasized all offseason long what goes into winning close games,\" Texas coach Shaka Smart said. \"A little bit here midway through the first half our guys probably felt like this wasn't going to be a close game, but it was.\"\n\nRoach led Texas (2-0) with 18 points, followed by Jericho Sims with 14 and Dylan Osetkowski with 11 and 13 rebounds. Texas led by double figures, and often by eight or nine, in the first half, and it led 36-30 at the break.\n\nArkansas (0-1) got a game-high 20 points from center Daniel Gafford, who also had a double-double with 12 rebounds. Joe added 17 points for the Razorbacks, while Jalen Harris and Mason Jones each had 11.\n\n\"This was our very first game,\" Arkansas coach Mike Anderson said. \"I thought they came to play. They kept that mindset. Even as Texas went up, double figures, 9, 10, whatever it was, our guys stayed the course. They got connected defensively and tried to make Daniel (Gifford) a big part of what we were doing.\"\n\nArkansas trailed 36-30 at the half, but a 10-0 run midway through the second half allowed the Razorbacks to take a 49-47 lead after a 3-pointer by Joe.\n\nThe Razorbacks outscored Texas 33-27 in the second half, but free-throw shooting kept the Longhorns in it. They went 14-for-20 shooting from the line in the second half and 4 of 6 in overtime. That allowed Texas to overcome cold shooting, including a stretch of 9:47 without a field goal in the second half.\n\nA dunk by Gafford put Arkansas ahead 62-59 with a minute to play. After an airball by Texas, Osetkowski made 1 of 2 free throws to make it 62-60. Gafford then missed the first of two free throws to push the lead to three, setting up Roach II's tying 3-pointer with 1 second left that forced overtime.\n\nIn overtime, the teams traded points and Arkansas led 71-70 after a pair of free throws by Harris. But Courtney Ramey banked in a floater to regain the lead for Texas, and Elijah Mitrou-Long added a free throw to seal it.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFriday's game was a look at two teams who are NCAA postseason regulars.\n\nArkansas began its pursuit of a third consecutive NCAA tournament berth. The Razorbacks, who were one of eight SEC teams in last year's NCAAs, have made the tournament three times in the past four years, and are looking to add to that with the nation's No. 25-ranked recruiting class. Arkansas was picked 10th in the preseason SEC poll.\n\nTexas played in its earliest season opener Friday. The Longhorns, who also made the NCAA tournament last season, return four of five starters from last year's team. Texas was picked fourth in the Big 12 preseason rankings. The Longhorns feature last year's No. 8-ranked recruiting class.\n\nFOR THE TROOPS\n\nFriday's game was more than a year in the making, and both teams were excited about the opportunity.\n\n\"You can't put a price on that,\" Arkansas' Anderson said. \"That was breathtaking for our guys to spend some time (here). It's an honor to come in and play in front of these guys. ... It was a great experience.\"\n\nRoach echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"The experience here was great,\" he said. \"I got family in the military. It was just wonderful here. We went to the training simulators. We shot fake guns, the simulator of being on the top of a tank and shooting. It's like real life Call of Duty here. It was real life that these people go through every day. We play basketball, but it's really life or death for them. We really appreciate the mentality they have protecting our country.\"\n\nNICE THREADS\n\nBoth teams were playing on Veteran's Day weekend in uniforms that had a military look, which camouflage and military-style letters and numbers. But there were no player names on the back - just \"USA\" on the jerseys of both teams.\n\nGYM TIME\n\nThe game was played at Fort Bliss' Soto Gym, which seated 1,200 for the game. The intimate environment, and bright lights much closer to the court, gave the game the feel of an old-time contest played in an armory. The bleachers around the court were only six rows deep.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTexas: The Longhorns continue their non-conference schedule with a home game Monday against Louisiana Monroe, followed by a home game on Friday against The Citadel.\n\nArkansas: The Razorbacks get Saturday and Sunday off before hosting UC Davis on Monday, which is part of the Hardwood Showcase event. All games are at Bud Walton Arena. Arkansas will play Indiana (Nov. 18), Montana State (Nov. 21) and UT Arlington (Nov. 23) in its other games in the Showcase.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college basketball coverage: http://collegebasketball.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Sept. 14) AP\n\nA Yemeni motorcyclist rides past burning tires in a street during a protest against inflation and the rise of living costs in the southwestern Yemeni city of Taez on Oct. 2, 2018. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned last month that the currency depreciation was likely to make another 3.5 million Yemenis food insecure, in addition to 8.4 million people who already need emergency food assistance. (Photo: AHMAD AL-BASHA, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Under increasing pressure from Congress, the Trump administration will curb its assistance to Saudi Arabia's deadly military campaign in Yemen, officials confirmed Friday.\n\nThe Defense and State departments said Friday that the U.S. would stop refueling Saudi fighter planes as the regime undertakes bombing campaigns that have resulted in thousands of civilian casualties.\n\nThe New York Times first reported the decision, casting it as a move by the administration to punish Saudi Arabia for its role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who had been critical of the Saudi regime. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey last month, after trying to obtain documents he needed to marry his finance.\n\nKhashoggi's death sparked international outrage, as well as intense scrutiny of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. President Donald Trump and other top administration officials have until now resisted calls to end arms sales to Saudi Arabia or otherwise penalize the regime for Khashoggi's death, citing the royal family's assistance in U.S. efforts to counter Iran.\n\nThe State Department did not comment on the decision but referred reporters to a statement from the Saudi government's official news agency. That statement said the Saudis no longer needed the Americans' assistance to refuel its planes because of its own military advances.\n\n\"Recently the kingdom and the coalition has increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refueling in Yemen,\" the Saudi government statement said. \"As a result, in consultation with the United States, the Coalition has requested cessation of inflight refueling support for its operations in Yemen.\"\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis said in a statement late Friday that he supported the Saudi's decision to use its \"own military capabilities to conduct inflight refueling in support of its operations in Yemen.\" He said the U.S. was focused on supporting a United Nations-led resolution to the conflict.\n\nThe announcement came just hours after two key senators called on the Trump administration to end its refueling of Saudi planes.\n\nMore: \u2018Stop starving people as instrument of war.' One Republican\u2019s blunt message to Saudis \u2014 and Trump\n\nMore: Amid increased pressure, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushes for end to Yemen conflict\n\n\"We call on the Trump administration to immediately end U.S. air refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft in Yemen,\" Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Todd Young, R-Ind., who both sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement earlier Friday.\n\n\"If the administration does not take immediate steps, including ending U.S. refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft, we are prepared to take additional action when the Senate comes back into session,\u201d the bipartisan pair wrote.\n\nLast week, Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo both called for a cease-fire and a negotiated solution to the conflict. Pompeo urged the warring parties to support the U.N.-led effort to broker a political resolution to the war \u2013 an effort that has proved unsuccessful over three years of bloody conflict.\n\nBut in the wake of that public pressure, the Saudis mounted fresh attacks on a key Yemeni port, and the Houthis also escalated their activity in the region \u2013 moves that threatened to worsen an already horrific humanitarian situation. Some foreign policy experts said the new aggressions amounted to a slap in the face to the Trump administration.\n\nAnd with Congress scheduled to reconvene next week, the likelihood of a contentious political showdown on Yemen seemed increasingly likely.\n\nThe U.S. has also provided military intelligence to the Saudis in the Yemen war, and there was no indication that would end. And some in Congress suggested they were not satisfied with Friday's announcement.\n\n\u201cBy finally ending refueling missions for Saudi bombers, the Trump administration is admitting our joint operation in Yemen has been a disaster,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a statement.\n\n\"So why only cut off refueling support? Why are we still helping the Saudis with targeting? Why are we still selling them the bombs at a discount?\" Murphy asked. \"Now that it's no longer a secret that the war in Yemen is a national security and humanitarian nightmare, we need to get all the way out. I will join several other colleagues to introduce a resolution in the coming weeks to do just that.\u201d\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., said halting U.S. refueling of Saudi plans was the right move, but he argued that other U.S. assistance to the Saudis should continue, given \"the ongoing threats from al-Qaeda, ISIS and the Houthis in Yemen.\"\n\nStill, Royce said the Trump administration should increase pressure on both the Saudis and the Houthi rebels to work out a political solution to the conflict.\n\n\"Millions of Yemenis are in desperate need of relief. Cholera and famine are widespread,\" the GOP lawmaker said. \"The Trump administration should look for more leverage to push both sides to find a peaceful solution.\"\n\nThe State Department did not comment on the New York Times' report that the U.S. would soon impose sanctions on more than a dozen Saudi officials deemed to be involved in Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe war in Yemen is a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and its arch enemy in the region, Iran. Iran has backed the Houthi rebels who overthrew Yemen's previous government. Saudi Arabia, as well as the U.S., fears that Iran is using the war in Yemen to expand its reach in the region.\n\nThe war has killed or injured at least 17,000 civilians, including hundreds of children, according to the United Nations. It has also put more than 8 million Yemenis on the brink of starvation.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/09/trump-administration-curb-military-support-saudi-led-yemen-war/1949821002/", "Buffalo guard Davonta Jordan (4) drives up court while being defended by West Virginia guard James Bolden (3) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Morgantown, W.Va.

(Cloe Poisson/Hartford Courant via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Jim Calhoun heard all the speculation that he would be a kinder, gentler coach at Division III University of Saint Joseph.\n\nHe is 76 years old, with health issues and no desire to offend the nuns at a small Catholic school that had only accepted women until this semester.\n\nBut a kinder, gentler Jim Calhoun?\n\n\"Wrong,\" he said. \"When we are in the battle, we are fighting all together.\"\n\nSix years after retiring from UConn, the Hall of Famer was in vintage form in his return to the sideline Friday night, knocking down chairs and confronting referees as his Blue Jays overcame a 13-point deficit in the second half to beat William Paterson 79-74 in the first men's college basketball game for St. Joe's.\n\nWith his team trailing 4-0 just 40 seconds into the game, Calhoun jumped from his seat, called his first timeout and loudly sent forward Mike Sagay to the bench. Sixteen minutes in, Calhoun picked up his first technical foul.\n\nDown 41-30 at halftime, he told the ESPN crew making a documentary about his return to coaching that it would not be able to air what he was about to say in the locker room.\n\n\"These are my guys. This is my team,\" he said. \"I told them, 'I take this stuff seriously.'\"\n\nHis players responded, going on a 23-2 run and outscoring William Patterson 49-33 in the second half.\n\n\"The way they came back was really special to me,\" Calhoun said. \"Sometimes you wonder why you coach the game. That's why I coach the game.\"\n\nCalhoun, who retired from UConn in 2012 with three national titles, has spent the last year building this program from scratch. He recruited the team (17 freshmen and three transfers), put together the schedule and has led fundraising for a new gym.\n\nThe current one holds about 350 people. The school played Friday's game at nearby Trinity College to accommodate the 1,800 fans who braved a pouring rain to see Calhoun's career record improve to 874-380.\n\nSt. Joe's has an undergraduate enrollment of just more than 900 students, with 94 freshmen men, many of whom learned about the school when it was announced that Calhoun would be in charge of the fledgling basketball program.\n\n\"There is no question about it, the visibility that we got from having Jim Calhoun associated with the men's basketball program is priceless,\" school president Rhona Free said.\n\nCalhoun had worked over the past six years as an ESPN analyst and a consultant at UConn. But he said he has missed coaching and it didn't take much for him to say yes when he was asked to come to Saint Joseph by the school's athletic director, Bill Cardarelli, once an assistant under Calhoun at UConn.\n\n\"Look at him,\" Cardarelli said as the Blue Jays were making their second-half run. \"He's so happy. You can see he's back where he belongs.\"\n\nCalhoun said his language Friday was a bit less salty. But he didn't spend much time sitting on the high-back stool he was given, even though he's acknowledged having a serious health problem, which he has declined to detail.\n\nBeing back coaching college kids, it appears, is just what the doctor ordered.\n\n\"When you see a group of people kind of bond together ... that's pretty special,\" Calhoun said. \"It's what I missed.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nVC Defense, a gun shop on Friday, Nov. 9, 2108, in Thousand Oaks, Calif. (Photo: Rob Schumacher, The Arizona Republic-USA TODAY Network)\n\nThe Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, site of the nation's latest major deadly mass shooting, rests just north of a residential neighborhood in this normally placid California enclave.\n\nThe horror that erupted there late Wednesday night brought out Brandon Simone and his neighbor, Molly, who live in apartments down the street from the bar.\n\nMolly, who asked that her last name not be used for her own safety, opened up her apartment and meager first-aid kit to survivors suffering broken bones, open gashes and mental anguish while they awaited medical treatment.\n\nFollowing that sleepless night, Simone and Molly drove together three miles down the road to VC Defense, the only brick-and-mortar gun store in town.\n\nSimone, 35, is a single father who previously vowed never to have a gun in the same home as his kid. But while his teenage son Ethan skateboarded outside, he asked the shop's owner what he needed to do to buy a 9-millimeter pistol.\n\nMolly filmed VC Defense\u2019s handgun display with her phone and sent the video to her boyfriend, insisting that he immediately buy one.\n\nFor John Von Colln, VC Defense\u2019s proprietor, the duo were among an unusually steady stream of customers that day. Many of them expressed the same sentiment: they had come to the gun store because no place feels safe anymore, and they felt ill-equipped to confront the next mass shooter or armed home invader.\n\nThere\u2019s a documented phenomenon in America following mass shootings in which gun enthusiasts stream to dealers to buy up contested accessories like bump stocks before they are made illegal. Von Colln\u2019s customers on Thursday didn't appear to be those types, at least not during the couple of hours he allowed a reporter to hang out in his store and speak with customers.\n\nThey weren\u2019t driven by a collector\u2019s desire to hoard guns and accessories, but by raw fear.\n\nSome were small business owners suddenly feeling vulnerable. Many were first-time buyers suddenly seeking weapons for self-defense. Von Colln had to turn at least one customer away because he didn\u2019t have proper paperwork fulfilling California\u2019s stringent identification requirements.\n\nA banker wearing business casual, designer glasses and a gold Rolex inquired about concealing a sidearm under a tucked-in dress shirt.\n\n\u201cI need more holsters because I am not going anywhere without my piece now,\u201d he announced.\n\nMore: What we know about Thousand Oaks gunman Ian David Long, a Marine veteran\n\nRelated: Tracking apps offer hope, dread for families in Thousand Oaks shooting\n\n3 minutes of terror: How the Thousand Oaks shooting unfolded\n\nAsking only to be identified as John for his safety, the banker said his son was outside the bar during the shooting, and that two of his son\u2019s friends were killed. His own fear, he said, is being caught unprepared at a mall targeted by another madman with a gun.\n\nVon Colln\u2019s salesman, a burly long-haired man in a black beanie who stood before a wall of rifles, counseled him on an ankle holster. If he ever found himself in a shoot-out at the mall, the banker could quickly unholster and unload while lying on his back.\n\nVon Colln said he knew he was in for an unusual day at the office when he threw on his work outfit of a \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d T-shirt and cargo shorts Thursday morning, less than twelve hours after gunman Ian David Long opened fire on the crowded bar. The crime scene just up the 101 Highway was still a chaotic carnival of law enforcement and media as several helicopters buzzed overhead.\n\nA television reporter called to ask whether he had sold Long his weapon of mass murder. Von Colln found, to his relief, that a check of his database showed the former Marine had never been a customer.\n\nVon Colln allows customers into his small gun shop by pushing a button which releases a heavy front gate. By noon Thursday, he could barely finish paperwork on a previous sale or bring out a new gun for a customer to handle before having to return to the button to let somebody else in.\n\nAs new customers cycled through the store, the constant chatter \u2013 besides general expressions of hatred for the shooter \u2013 was about the six unarmed, off-duty law enforcement officers who were reportedly at the bar during the shooting. Their lack of weapons was a presumed consequence of a California law barring firearms in bars.\n\n\u201cAt least there could\u2019ve been a chance\u201d of preventing the shooting if they were armed, said Von Colln.\n\nA former engineer who turned his gun hobby into a livelihood, Von Colln described California\u2019s ever-tightening gun laws as the work of out-of-touch politicians creating a labyrinth of irrational rules so complicated even his clients in law enforcement can\u2019t follow them.\n\nA relative of police officers, he teared up while describing his cousin\u2019s shooting death on duty. \u201cI take this very seriously, what we do,\u201d said Von Colln. \u201cSome people would love to have all gun shops done, but without a legal way people are going to be doing it illegally.\u201d\n\nResidents have long regarded this city as a serene little community forty miles away from the crime and blight of Los Angeles. But the shooting this week drove home a creeping feeling that the outside world is encroaching on Thousand Oaks.\n\nMike Rowan, a former corrections officer who teaches gun handling courses at nearby Trigger Burst Training Center, said he fielded calls all Thursday from potential clients motivated to get gun permits following the bar shooting.\n\nSome of his teachings focus on fending off an active shooter, and Rowan said he expected an uptick in business similar to the one he experienced after the Las Vegas concert massacre last year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just frightened,\u201d Rowan said of this new client base. \u201cUnfortunately these mass shootings are good for business, and I say that very solemnly.\u201d\n\nRowan described a discreet, and distinctly Californian, clientele. They pull up to his range in Priuses and Teslas and never tell their friends they own a gun.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of closet liberals, people who normally would never want anything to do with a firearm, and I train them and they secretly own firearms,\u201d Rowan said.\n\nSimone, who drove with his neighbor to VC Defense following the shooting, would have previously counted himself among the anti-gun crowd. He used to believe that the danger of having a gun in his home with his son outweighed any protective value, but the shooting shifted his thinking.\n\nCLOSE Residents near Thousand Oaks, California already reeling from the shock of a mass shooting were confronting wildfire dangers Friday as a fast-moving blaze swept through the area - threatening homes and forcing evacuations. (Nov. 9) AP\n\nHis neighbor Molly was less equivocal. She openly questioned her boyfriend\u2019s manhood if he continued to hesitate to buy a gun. She was ready to buy one herself.\n\n\u201cThirteen people would have not died\u201d if people who were trained with firearms were armed on Wednesday night, she said.\n\nSimone described gun-opposing friends and family who were also \u201ccoming around\u201d to this line of thinking, asking him to keep them posted on the process of buying a firearm in California.\n\nHe believes that the real issue causing gun violence isn\u2019t the ease of buying firearms but the lack of ready treatment for mental health problems.\n\nSimone used himself as an example. He said he has recently sought counseling following the deaths of several loved ones but has been stymied in receiving help by delays and bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cWhat if I was that guy?\u201d Simone said of Long, the shooter. \u201cI\u2019m the farthest from those guys. But I empathize with them.\u201d\n\nFor his teenage son Ethan, who skated around in the parking lot, it had been a surreal and frightening twelve hours in Thousand Oaks. He had been awoken by gunshots and then evacuated from school following a gun threat there, while just northward huge smoke clouds billowed from a raging brush fire in the hills.\n\nHe chimed in with his opinion on gun control. \u201cNo matter how hard they make it to get a gun, they\u2019re going to get one,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI\u2019m a kid and I don\u2019t know anything but I know that.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/09/thousand-oaks-following-ian-long-shooting-borderline-bar-and-grill-fearful-residents-buy-guns/1947476002/", "POMONA, Calif.

All that mattered to the Wildcats was proving they could regroup from a blowout loss and get their first victory.\n\nIt certainly took everything for them to scrape past Southern Illinois.\n\nKeldon Johnson and Immanuel Quickley each scored 15 points, Nick Richards grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds and the Wildcats rallied in the second half to beat the Salukis 71-59 on Friday night.\n\nKentucky (1-1) managed to bounce back from Tuesday night's 118-84 shellacking by No. 4 Duke, its most lopsided loss under coach John Calipari. It left the Wildcats a lot of room for improvement, but the biggest question was whether they could shake the disappointment of being pounded by the Blue Devils on a national stage.\n\nThe Wildcats did, but they had to work hard in the second half to overcome sloppy play and the veteran Salukis, who led 44-37 before Quickley and Quade Green (14 points) made consecutive 3-pointers to spark a 10-2 run for a 47-46 lead with 12:19 left.\n\n\"Our energy and effort was off the charts,\" Quickley said. \"This team's really good with that. We just have to keep getting better every day, individually and as a team.\"\n\nSIU didn't quit, but the Wildcats slowly extended their lead to 61-52 on consecutive three-point plays by Johnson and Green. Kentucky went on to win, and Calipari saw the effort as progress no matter how it looked.\n\n\"I just said, be happy we won and figure it out,\" said the coach, who has won all 10 home openers with Kentucky. \"I've got a pretty good idea of how I'm going to do this now, and I'm just glad that we really got smashed, so there's no question.\n\n\"If you demand a lot, you get a lot.

The sophomore forward had as many boards as the Salukis combined, surpassing his previous best of 15 last season against Fort Wayne. His total matched the highest by a Kentucky player since Michael Kidd-Gilchrist grabbed 19 against Louisville in December 2011.\n\n\"My team just needed to get rebounds with Reid (Travis) out of the game,\" said Richards, who also had three blocks. \"Just playing my game and guys were just playing better, just trying to play harder as team to get the 'W.'\"\n\nThe Wildcats also shot 47 percent after halftime and limited SIU to 1 of 7 shooting from long range.\n\nAaron Cook had 18 points and Kavion Pippen 16 for the Salukis (0-1), who opened against their first ranked team since No. 13 Illinois in 2010.

Tennessee won 87-65. (AP photo/Wade Payne) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee's Grant Williams has some bad news for the rest of the Southeastern Conference. The league's preseason player of the year has added a 3-point shot to his arsenal.\n\nWilliams scored 31 points, pulled down 10 rebounds and shot 3 of 4 from 3-point range Friday as No. 6 Tennessee breezed to an 87-65 victory over Louisiana-Lafayette. His output Friday matched his 3-point total from all of last season, when he shot 3 of 25 from beyond the arc.\n\n\"I'm definitely way more confident,\" Williams said. \"It's definitely reinforced confidence as well. My teammates are encouraging me to take more and be more confident in shooting them. (Jordan) Bone was probably the biggest one telling me, when he was getting to the crack, he was throwing it back and he literally screamed, 'Shoot it!' one time.\"\n\nWilliams shot 11 of 15 overall to lead five Tennessee players in double figures. Williams' big performance came one day after receiving a stern message from Tennessee coach Rick Barnes, who wanted the 6-foot-7 junior forward to rebound better.\n\nBarnes said assistant coaches Rob Lanier and Michael Schwartz predicted Thursday afternoon that Williams would respond by scoring 30 points. Williams did even better than that.\n\n\"One thing about Grant, we can have some pretty serious, intense talks and some guys will fold up and go in a shell, (but) he's not going to do that,\" Barnes said. \"He's not that kind of person. He'll listen. Sometimes it gets to a point where he knows I'm going to tell him what I think.\"\n\nWilliams said Barnes' words had an impact.\n\n\"He really got into me yesterday, and it really affected me tonight, something I probably thought of the entire night last night,\" said Williams, who was selected by SEC coaches as the league's player of the year last season. \"I was sitting there just in my room thinking about what he was saying. He was being honest. He's the type of guy that's going to challenge you. He's not going to sugarcoat anything.\"\n\nAdmiral Schofield had 15 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for Tennessee (2-0). Kyle Alexander, Jordan Bowden and Bone added 10 points each. Bone also matched a career high with eight assists.\n\nJaKeenan Gant scored 18 points, Marcus Stroman had 11 and Justin Miller added 10 for Louisiana-Lafayette (1-1).\n\nTennessee took the lead for good less than seven minutes into the game during a 20-2 run that turned a 13-10 deficit into a 30-15 advantage. The Vols maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way.\n\n\"We started taking some bad shots, got some turnovers against us and then they pushed out and hit for a great percentage, got us on the offensive boards and got the crowd into it,\" Louisiana-Lafayette coach Bob Marlin said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLouisiana-Lafayette: The Ragin' Cajuns are testing themselves early as they try to build off a 2017-18 season in which it went 27-7 and won the Sun Belt regular-season title. Louisiana-Lafayette follows this game by visiting No. 1 Kansas on Nov. 16.

The schedule gets tougher next week as Tennessee hosts Georgia Tech before heading to the NIT Season Tip-Off in New York. Tennessee plays Louisville in its first NIT game before facing either Kansas or Marquette.\n\nPONS POWER\n\nYves Pons wasn't one of the Tennessee players to score in double figures, as he had just four points in 18 minutes. But the sophomore swingman's defense was one of the key factors in the game, according to Barnes.\n\n\"Yves will be a player that we'll really watch grow up right in front of us this year,\" Barnes said. \"He changed the game when he came in and started guarding the point guard.

(AP) \u2014 Even Stanford coach Jerod Haase knows that the Cardinal's early season schedule might be a bit much.\n\nSophomore KZ Okpala had 23 points and Stanford scored 17 unanswered first-half points to take control and beat UNC Wilmington 72-59 on Friday night, the first of two games in North Carolina amid a November full of cross-country flights.\n\nCormac Ryan added 14 for the Cardinal (2-0), who traveled about 2,500 miles to become the first power-conference team to visit the Seahawks in nearly a decade. After traveling to No. 8 North Carolina to return a game after the Tar Heels visited them last year, the Cardinal will come home for one game, then head back east for the three-games-in-three-days Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas during the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n\"It's all about frequent-flier miles,\" Haase quipped to The Associated Press afterward.\n\nStanford trailed by eight midway through the first half but held the Seahawks (0-2) without a basket for the final 7\u00bd minutes before halftime to take a 39-25 lead at the break. Stanford quickly pushed that margin to 18, and UNCW got no closer than eight again.\n\nDevontae Cacok and Jeantal Cylla each scored 14 for the Seahawks (0-2), who were hosting a power-conference opponent for the first time since losing to Wake Forest from the Atlantic Coast Conference in December 2009. There was a connection that helped get this one scheduled: the teams are coached by former Kansas teammates and North Carolina assistant coaches under Roy Williams in Haase and UNCW's C.B. McGrath.\n\nUNCW, from the Colonial Athletic Association, is slated to return the visit next season.\n\n\"I'm appreciative of him coming on the road,\" McGrath said. \"Not too many coaches at a (power-conference) school would do that. I really appreciate him bringing his team, letting the fans see what Stanford looks like, a Pac-12 school.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nStanford: The November miles will add up quickly. Haase will certainly learn a bit about his team's maturity in handling this opening stretch, as well as a nonconference schedule that includes a visit to top-ranked Kansas on Dec. 1.\n\n\"I want to be part of the Atlantis tournament because it's a special deal,\" Haase said. \"I want to go back and play at Kansas because it's a special deal. Now, as we've done that, we've created a schedule that's pretty insane \u2014 and probably a little more aggressive than I would like to, more travel that I would like.\n\n\"But it's also part of the process right now. The guys have to learn how to play on the road.\"\n\nUNCW: Things haven't been easy for the Seahawks in recent months. They didn't have a typical preseason after having to relocate early practices to Chapel Hill with the campus closed in the wake of damage and flooding to the region from Hurricane Florence in September, including damage to some parts of Trask Coliseum and other campus buildings. They've now started with two turnover-filled games, first with 18 turnovers that led to 25 points in Tuesday's overtime loss at Campbell.\n\nThey struggled to take care of the basketball against Stanford's length, finishing with 20 turnovers that Stanford converted into 26 points.\n\n\"It all comes down to having focus,\" Cacok said. \"We've got to take care of the ball. When we have turnovers, we don't get shots up. When we don't get shots up, we don't score the ball.\"\n\nOKPALA'S START\n\nIt was the second straight big game for the 6-foot-9 Okpala, who had a career-best 29 points to go with 10 rebounds and five assists in the season-opening win against Seattle. He was also aggressive, getting to the foul line 11 times.\n\n\"I'm just playing hard, just playing within myself,\" he said, \"just executing what we're supposed to do.\"\n\nTHEFT\n\nStanford had 15 steals, its best total in any game since swiping 15 against Oregon State in January 2006.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nStanford: The Cardinal will practice in Wilmington on Saturday, then travel to eighth-ranked UNC for Monday's game.\n\nUNCW: McGrath gets another Tar Heels reunion Tuesday with a visit from UNC Greensboro and Spartans coach Wes Miller, who played for UNC from 2004-07 during McGrath's time on Williams' staff.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: http://apnews.com/collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Freshman E'Mya Price made the biggest impact and led the Eagles with 11 points. Graham managed nine points and 13 rebounds.\n\nCoppin State had few answers for the Terrapins' taller frontcourt and was outrebounded 71-39.\n\n\"We have so many weapons inside and out,\" Charles said. \"We need to be able to utilize that so we can be good as a team and go far.\"\n\nMaryland was never threatened and a late free throw by Austin provided a 48-20 lead at the break.

The Terrapins have sharp-shooters up and down the roster and Frese is confident they can routinely make shots from beyond the arc. ... Maryland also had 20 assists and just eight turnovers.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nCoppin State: The Eagles suffered their second straight lopsided loss after falling to No. 25 West Virginia 78-37 loss on Tuesday. However, the tough nonconference schedule should have them battle-tested for lesser-caliber opponents in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.\n\nMaryland: The Terrapins won at least a share of the Big Ten championship in each of their first three seasons before finishing second last year.

North Carolina won 116-67. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nELON, N.C. (AP) \u2014 No. 8 North Carolina opened an in-state neighbor's arena by putting up some numbers that will be tough for other teams to surpass.\n\nThe Tar Heels routed Elon 116-67 on Friday night behind 21 points apiece from Cameron Johnson and freshman Nassir Little.\n\nFreshman Coby White added 14 points to help the Tar Heels (2-0) sweep their two-game, season-opening barnstorming tour of regional mid-majors. They beat Wofford 78-67 on Tuesday night in Spartanburg, South Carolina, before having a much easier time against the Phoenix, who christened their new $40 million on-campus arena.\n\nThe point total matched UNC's highest in 16 seasons under Roy Williams and was the program's most in a decade. North Carolina also scored 116 against UNC Asheville in 2008.\n\n\"It was a nice night for us,\" Williams said. \"It was a nice night, I hope, for Elon, except for the score.\"\n\nLittle was 9 of 13 while Johnson finished 7 of 11. The Pittsburgh transfer has reached double figures in both games since having offseason hip surgery, and had 16 points in the first half.\n\n\"I felt like I was in a good place against Wofford, and I felt like I was in a good place today in warm-ups, and that kind of carries on over to the court,\" Johnson said. \"I'm not thinking about too much \u2014 just playing.\"\n\nSterling Manley added 11 points and Luke Maye finished with 10 rebounds for North Carolina, which shot 52 percent \u2014 including 56 percent during a defense-optional first half that ended with the Tar Heels leading 63-45.\n\nThey finished with a 60-31 rebounding edge and outscored Elon 56-22 in the paint, pushing their lead into the 20s for good on White's 3-pointer barely a minute into the second half and going up by 30 on Little's dunk with less than 14 minutes to play.\n\nSheldon Eberhardt scored 16 points, Steven Santa Ana added 14 and Tyler Seibring finished with 10 for the Phoenix (1-1). They haven't beaten North Carolina since 1918 and remained winless against Top 25 opponents since moving to Division I in the late 1990s.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNorth Carolina: Playing before a lively road crowd didn't rattle the Tar Heels' two highest-profile freshmen. White, who earned a second straight start at point guard, looked more comfortable than he did against Wofford, scoring in double figures for the first time. So did Little, who by far was the most athletic player on the court and scored 10 points during that high-scoring, tone-setting first half.\n\nElon: Getting the Tar Heels to make the 35-mile trip west was a big deal for the Phoenix \u2014 the schools haven't played here since 1950. But they didn't have enough offensive firepower to handle an up-and-down game with a UNC team that went nearly a dozen men deep. That won't be as much of a problem once Elon gets into Colonial Athletic Association play.\n\n\"We know in playing (Power) Five opponents, we have a chance to play against the best, but you may be exposed,\" coach Matt Matheny said. \"You learn a lot from this experience. ... You take away as much as you possibly can. ... Tonight, when we didn't box out, we got exposed.\"\n\nKEY STAT\n\nWhen Elon was shooting, North Carolina simply controlled the glass.

UNC had 29 second-chance points to 10 for Elon.\n\nCAM'S BIG NIGHT\n\nOnly once as a Tar Heel has Johnson had a higher-scoring game: He had 32 in a January loss at Clemson. He did have three games with at least 21 points during his 2016-17 season at Pittsburgh.\n\nKENNY'S ROUGH NIGHT\n\nIt's not been a great start for UNC guard Kenny Williams, whose lone points this season came on a free throw in the first half of this one. Williams missed all seven of his field goals \u2014 including five 3-pointers \u2014 in 20 minutes against Elon, bringing his season shooting total to 0 for 10 in 49 total minutes.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\"He got over in front of our bench and wiped up the water, so I told him he got something accomplished tonight \u2014 he turned into a manager,\" Roy Williams, on Kenny Williams' shooting struggles.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorth Carolina: Plays its home opener Monday night against Stanford, led by former Williams assistant Jerod Haase.\n\nElon: Plays host to Milligan of the NAIA on Nov. 15.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Friday night, the Keydets set out to take that away, but it didn't take long for the Panthers to adjust.\n\nWith VMI hanging back, Pitt senior Jared Wilson-Frame scored 20 points in his season debut, and the Panthers drained 13 3-pointers in a 94-55 victory.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the game, Wilson-Frame was a weapon from the outside. After the Keydets (1-1) scored the first basket, Wilson-Frame hit a trio of 3-pointers as Pitt (2-0) raced out on a 19-3 run.\n\n\"We talk about making that first hit; punching someone in the mouth first,\" Wilson-Frame said. \"It's really important to us.\"\n\nHe also hit a leaning, long-range 3-pointer just before the first-half buzzer to send the Panthers into the break with an 18-point lead. Wilson-Frame finished shooting 5 of 9 from 3-point range and 6 of 10 overall. It was the fifth time he scored 20 points or more in his Pitt career.\n\n\"He hit some deep shots,\" Earl said. \"We were attempting to pack it in a little bit, but know where he was. ...

The reigning Southern Conference freshman of the year scored 16 after putting up 23 in VMI's season opener. Parham will have to shoulder some of the load outside until Vereen can return.\n\n\"Other teams look at a stat sheet and go, 'OK, that kid can score a little bit and do some things, let's try to take him out,'\" Earl said. \"That's another sign of growth.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPitt will continue its five-game homestand against Troy on Monday.\n\nVMI will host Division III Goucher College on Sunday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Joe Skipper) ORG XMIT: FLJS106 (Photo: Joe Skipper, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON - Many Americans knew days ago who their elected officials would be following Tuesday midterm election.\n\nBut things have moved slower in several states due to razor-thin races. Some Republicans are claiming voter fraud. Democrats are vowing to make sure every ballot is counted.\n\nThe increasingly tense situations in Florida and Arizona have included lawsuits, protests, possible recounts, and even comments from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe tight races for Senate in Arizona, along with governor and Senate in Florida, have gotten tighter over the days as more ballots were counted. But the legal bickering has gotten ugly and soured already bitter races in a divided nation.\n\n\"It is incredibly troubling,\" said David Becker, a former Justice Department voting-rights lawyer. \"These counties haven't even finished counting ballots. This is all about winning and nothing about fraud, but it comes at the cost of delegitimizing our own democracy.\"\n\nThe drama in Florida\n\nWelcome to the Sunshine State, where the dramatic elections live.\n\nThe increasing tense race between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Bill Nelson in Florida's Senate race spurred lawsuits from both candidates. All but two counties have finished counting ballots, but those counties have caused the margin of Scott's lead in the race to fall drastically, from 60,000 to about 15,000.\n\nScott filed a lawsuit alleging \"rampant fraud\" in the counties that heavily favor Democrats. Scott requested an investigation and questioned whether Democrat-led counties had been taking longer to count ballots in some sort of effort to inflate the Democratic vote.\n\nCLOSE Florida Governor and Senate candidate Rick Scott says he is asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections offices in Palm Beach and Broward counties, questioning whether they were trying to inflate the Democratic vote. (Nov. 9) AP\n\nHe didn't include any proof of the accusations, but the message took hold with Republicans across the state, even reaching the White House.\n\n\"Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they 'found' many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \u201c'The Broward Effect.' How come they never find Republican votes?,\" President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter Friday.\n\nThe lawsuit led to a Broward County Circuit judge on Friday ordering Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes to release records requested by Scott and the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee related to voting tabulations. The ruling did not include anything about the accusations of fraud.\n\nThe Broward County Canvassing Board was to meet in the early afternoon, and about 30 Republican protesters had gathered outside by midday.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t steal our election!\u201d they shouted in chants alternated with songs including \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nCLOSE The Palm Beach County Canvassing board is still reviewing ballots with irregularities 3 days after the midterm elections (Nov 11). AP\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign says it\u2019s readying for a possible recount. Gillum conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis on Tuesday night, though the race has since tightened. DeSantis led Gillum by 0.47 percentage point as of Thursday afternoon. That's under the 0.5 percent threshold for a recount.\n\nThe deeply purple state will learn Saturday whether there will be recounts in both races when unofficial vote counts are due.\n\nArizona catching Trump's attention\n\nU.S. Senate Candidates Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema (Photo: The Republic)\n\nA similar scene is playing out in Arizona, where results continue to pour in for the Senate race between Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, tightening an already close race.\n\nMcSally held the early lead but Sinema, as of Friday evening, was ahead by more than 21,000 votes.\n\nStill, 266,000 ballots need to be counted.\n\nAmid the tally, Republicans accused the state of election fraud, alleging there was voting irregularities. They did not provide any proof of the claims.\n\nPresident Donald Trump stoked fears about the issues, calling the process corrupt and questioning whether another election was needed.\n\n\u201cJust out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cElectoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!\u201d\n\nCLOSE Candidates for Arizona's U.S Senate seat are only separated by one percentage point. USA TODAY\n\nMcSally, Sinema and their allies poured tens of millions of dollars into advertising to help lock down the seat. Although Republicans maintained control of the Senate in this week's midterm elections, any seat picked up by a Democrat would eat into their narrow margin.\n\nOn Friday morning, the Arizona Republican Party accused Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes of \"premeditated destruction of evidence\" after \"voting irregularities\" in the election.\n\nLocal Republicans have brought a legal case against Fontes and other county recorders over the verification of signatures on some early ballots.\n\nFontes has argued that verifying the signatures ensures all legitimate votes are counted. Republicans say the practice is inconsistent because other county recorders don't try to verify ballots with mismatched signatures beyond Election Day.\n\nAssertions of election fraud in Arizona ricocheted through talk radio and Republican Facebook groups Thursday night and Friday morning, as some perpetuated the idea that McSally's reversed lead was the result of a fraudulent or unfair process.\n\nWhy are the counts taking so long?\n\nVotes are still being counted across the country but most Americans don't realize it because the races weren't close enough and thus, were already called.\n\nThe closer the race, the longer it can take to figure out the winner, Becker said.\n\nThere are a million reasons why ballots continue to be counted days after the election. Absentee ballots, provisional ballots and signature verification are among the most common reasons for delays.\n\n\"I think people have trouble realizing sometimes there are just close elections,\" Becker said. \"You can have a big state like Arizona or Florida where people are split, and there's a process for that.\"\n\nIn Arizona, a large number of voters cast early ballots. These must be signature-verified and opened by a bipartisan board of election workers. That means many ballots turned in at the last minute take days or weeks to count.\n\nIn Florida, Broward County election officials have been adding early in-person votes and absentee ballots to the count over the last several days.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Broward and Palm Beach counties were the only counties in the state that had yet to complete vote-by-mail absentee counts and report them to the state, according to the Florida Department of State website. In addition to those, Broward had yet to completely report early voting ballots to the state.\n\nBecker said the delays are normal and anything but rare, pointing to a Senate race in Minnesota, a Washington governor's race and of course, Florida's counting debacle in the 2000 presidential race.\n\nHe said the use of the word fraud was dangerous and could have an impact on voters in future elections.\n\n\"It doesn't reflect well on us as Americans that we want to win so bad that we're willing to tear down our institutions to do so,\" he said. \"Sometimes our candidate loses a race. That's how the process works and it's up to all of us to respect it.\"\n\nContributing: Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Jessica Boehm of the Arizona Republic; Michael Collins of USA TODAY; Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/09/florida-and-arizona-elections-why-republicans-claiming-voter-fraud/1947000002/", "The Rockets\u2019 decision to sign Carmelo Anthony to a one-year, $2.4 million deal back in August always looked like a modest gamble, and as Houston has stumbled to a 4-6 start to the season, it\u2019s clear that Anthony likely won\u2019t be able to deliver vintage performances on a consistent basis.

Two weeks later it seems to happen again. That can not be the reality of our world today. We want to make sure that we don\u2019t just go about our lives.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Desmond King is showing signs of developing into a complete player for the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe second-year cornerback, who was used mainly as a blitzer last season, is being used more in man coverage while also getting some opportunities on special teams as a returner.\n\nKing has three interceptions in the Chargers' past three games. He is the AFC's defensive player of the week after returning an interception 42 yards for a touchdown in last Sunday's 25-17 win at Seattle . It is the second straight year that King has had a pick-six (he had a 90-yard interception for a TD last season at Dallas).\n\nHe is one of eight players in the conference with three picks as the Chargers (6-2) travel to Oakland on Sunday looking to extend their five-game winning streak.\n\n\"He doesn't have the height, the weight, the speed and all that, but if you look at Desmond he's always been a very productive player and that's not going to change when you get to the NFL. It's just a pattern of success,\" Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nKing won the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given to the nation's top corner, when he was a junior at Iowa in 2015. He returned for his senior season but wasn't drafted until the fifth round last year.\n\nKing has lined up as a slot corner the past two seasons, but he has improved this year in man coverage. He said he hardly played that at Iowa due to the scheme but that it is something he worked on during the offseason.\n\n\"I feel like I am doing a pretty good job with that this year,\" King said. \"It's not that much harder than transitioning from a zone team.\"\n\nDefensive coordinator Gus Bradley has noted that King has always been a physical player who can tackle in space, but that his comfort level with the defense has grown, which has allowed him to be more consistent.\n\n\"He's anticipating and he's making plays. There's a couple plays that took place (against Seattle) that it wasn't really his responsibility, but he identified it and played a pass and eliminated a big play for us,\" Bradley said.\n\nKing was used plenty as a blitzer last season and he had four sacks. First-round pick Derwin James is being used as a blitzer this season but Bradley said he might still use King in that role during the second half of the season.\n\nKing has also been used more on punt returns due to wide receiver Travis Benjamin being injured for most of the season. Lynn said this week that with Benjamin finally healthy, he is planning on using both players.\n\nWith last week's score, King joined Roy Williams as the only defensive backs in NFL history to have at least four sacks and two INTs for TDs their first two years. He also doesn't mind being challenged covering opposing teams' slot receivers.\n\n\"I feel like playing inside is harder than playing outside. A lot of people say you need size and speed to play outside but anyone can play it,\" King said. \"As long as we are having success, have your cover guys cover and have your blitzers blitz.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bill Nelson, D-Fla. in November (Photo: Wilfredo Lee (AP)/John McCall/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Two Florida races that were among the most closely watched political contests in the country appeared headed for a recount amid lawsuits and charges of election fraud.\n\nThree days after the election, no winner had been declared in the state\u2019s races for governor and U.S. Senate. Both remained too close to call with lots of ballots still to be counted.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\nLikely recounts\n\nRazor-thin margins in both races are raising the possibility of recounts.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign says it\u2019s readying for a possible recount. Gillum conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis on Tuesday night, though the race has since tightened. DeSantis led Gillum by about 36,000 votes on Friday. That's a difference of 0.44 percent, just under the 0.5 percent threshold for a recount.\n\nIn the Senate race, the Republican challenger, Gov. Rick Scott, claimed victory just before midnight Tuesday, when he held a lead of about 0.8 percentage points with a handful of precincts to be counted. But the incumbent, Democrat Bill Nelson, never conceded the race.\n\nAs the ballot counting continued, Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson shrank \u2013 from 60,000 votes to around 15,000 as of Friday. That's a difference of 0.18 percent. An automatic hand recount is triggered when the difference reached one-quarter of one percent of the vote, or about 20,413 ballots.\n\nLawsuits filed\n\nDuring a Thursday night news conference, Scott announced he is suing the Palm Beach and Broward county supervisors of elections, saying \u201cthere may be rampant fraud\u201d in the counties that heavily favor Democrats. He\u2019s asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate.\n\nScott asked the courts to order Broward County Supervisors of Election Brenda Snipes to turn over several records detailing the counting and collection of ballots.\n\nWithout citing any evidence of wrongdoing, Scott also asked Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections offices in both counties, questioning whether they have been taking too long in some sort of effort to inflate the Democratic vote.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, officials in Broward were still tallying early voting and absentee ballots, according to the state's election website.

Patrick Riley, patrick.riley@naplesnews.com; 239-263-4825\n\nA federal judge Friday set a hearing in the middle of next week following a request to include ballots with mismatched signatures in a possible recount. After a half-hour telephone conference with attorneys on both sides, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle told them to prepare written briefs over the weekend \u2013 despite the state\u2019s statutory deadline for all counties to submit complete, unofficial vote totals to the Secretary of State's office by noon on Saturday.\n\nNelson\u2019s lawyers pleaded that, if mailed ballots with signatures not matching those on registration records are excluded from the unofficial count, those votes would not be counted toward a recount of the Senate race. But Hinkel said they could still be counted after noon Saturday if he subsequently grants Nelson\u2019s request.\n\nHinkle set a hearing for 1 p.m. next Wednesday in his Tallahassee courtroom.\n\nIf he succeeds, Nelson could get thousands of ballots back into the final count, which he needs to overtake Scott\u2019s slim advantage.\n\nTrump tweets fraud accusation\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in on the race in a series of tweets on Friday.\n\nTrump blasted South Florida elections officials and Democrats over the counting of votes in Broward and Palm Beach counties, which are home to hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters.\n\nTrump tweeted. \"[Republican Senate candidate] Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u201cfound\u201d many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \u201cThe Broward Effect.\u201d How come they never find Republican votes?\u201d\n\nRick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u201cfound\u201d many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \u201cThe Broward Effect.\u201d How come they never find Republican votes? \u2014 Donald J.

Bush or Al Gore would lead the country.\n\nBut a lot has changed since then. Election supervisors say the numerous changes implemented after that disputed election should make this year\u2019s recount much smoother. The lines of authority are more clearly drawn and procedures standardized.\n\nPaul Lux, president of the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections, vividly remembers the efforts 18 years ago and how results were hampered by Florida counties using a half-dozen different methods of voting.\n\nNow, he said the state-wide system is more \u201charmonized\u201d and administratively he expects few problems with a machine recount and the hand count of over and under votes, where required.\n\nBut the current political environment in which the recount will be held is a different story, Lux said.\n\n\u201cGovernor, U.S. Senate, a Cabinet seat,\u201d Lux said. \u201cThis is going to make the (political) environment we operated under in Bush v.

Volunteers were calling voters whom they believed cast provisional ballots and urging them to go to their county boards of elections and make sure their vote was counted.\n\nVoters cast provisional ballots when their eligibility can't be determined at their polling place. Elections officials review the ballots to determine eligibility. All legitimate votes were to be counted by Friday.\n\nThe campaign also organized voters to tell their stories.\n\nTate Delgado of Gwinnett County, a sophomore at the University of Southern California, said he requested an absentee ballot, but his application was rejected due to a signature mismatch.\n\nHe said the rejection letter was sent to his home address in Georgia. By the time it was rerouted to his residence in California, it was too late to address the matter.\n\nDelgado, who flew to Georgia for the press conference, called the rejection of applications and ballots voter suppression.\n\n\"If you look at the people who specifically were not allowed to vote there is a very clear demographic,\" he said. \"It's definitely very targeted at young people and at minorities.\"\n\nLawyers for the Abrams campaign prevailed in a complaint filed Thursday involving absentee ballots in Dougherty County.\n\nThe lawyers said delivery of ballots in the county was delayed in part by Hurricane Michael. A judge ruled Friday that the county must accept all absentee ballots received by Friday. The ruling was expected to impact a few dozen votes.\n\nAll counties in Georgia are required to certify their election results by 5 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nWroh-Gargo said the Abrams campaign will fight beyond that deadline if necessary.\n\n\u201cOur pursuit of ensuring every vote is counted will continue for as long as it needs to be,\" Wroh-Gargo said. \u201cAnd all options are on the table for additional litigation to ensure that that is the case.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/09/georgia-governor-election-republican-brian-kemp-democrat-stacey-abrams-vote/1944123002/", "Injured Iowa State guard Lindell Wigginton sits on the bench before an NCAA college basketball game against Missouri, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Ames, Iowa.

Unveiled in 2016, Harmony is just a tad smaller than Symphony of the Seas at 226,963 tons. (Photo: Michel Verdure)\n\nIt's official: The new world's largest cruise ship is now sailing out of the world's largest cruise hub.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's giant Symphony of the Seas late Friday departed from PortMiami for the first time on a four-night voyage to Mexico. The sailing began just 15 hours after the 228,081-ton vessel pulled into Miami for the first time.\n\nThe departure was marked by celebrations both on and off Symphony, which soars 18 decks high and is nearly 1,200 feet long. Fireworks lit up the sky over Miami's waterfront and a fire boat sprayed water high into the air as the vessel glided down PortMiami's Main Channel toward the Atlantic Ocean. Royal Caribbean fans lined the ship's top decks, tweeting out photos and video.\n\nUnveiled earlier this year in Europe, Symphony is built on the same platform as Royal Caribbean's 2-year-old Harmony of the Seas, the previous size leader in cruising. But it eclipses its sibling by more than 1,000 tons and offers several new features.\n\nAmong additions are a first-of-its-kind, two-deck-high family suite with a slide between floors, a revamped Boardwalk amusement area, a new laser tag attraction and a new-for-Royal Caribbean seafood restaurant. Symphony also has more cabins than Harmony.\n\nWhile Symphony spent its first few months sailing in Europe, it only was a temporary assignment. The resort-like vessel has long been scheduled to sail out of Miami year-round starting this month. The ship arrived in Miami on Friday after a 12-night voyage from Barcelona. The arrival came a day after the vessel made a brief stop at Port Canaveral, Florida \u2014 its first call in North America.\n\nSymphony's official coming out party in North America will take place next Thursday in Miami when it is christened by actors and mega-cruise fans Carlos and Alexa PenaVega, along with their one-year-old son Ocean.\n\nRELATED: Five things to love about Symphony of the Seas | Why we love giant cruise ships like Symphony | Yes, an even bigger sister to Symphony is on the way\n\nDesigned for vacationers who love big, bustling mega-resorts, Symphony boasts one of the highest concentrations of attractions for both adults and children at sea. Like its sister Harmony, it has a record-breaking thrill slide that plunges nearly 100 feet and a \"bionic bar\" with a robot bartender. It also offers three main pool areas, a water slide complex, an adults-only solarium, an ice skating rink, two rock climbing walls, a basketball court and a mall-like indoor promenade with shops, bars and eateries. Like Harmony, it also has an open-air, tree-lined area called Central Park with restaurants, bars and upscale shops such as Bulgari.\n\nSymphony can hold up to 6,680 passengers and sails with a crew of 2,200, meaning that on busy weeks it can be home to nearly 9,000 people. It was constructed over three years at the giant Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in St. Nazaire, France \u2014 the same shipyard that built Harmony. Its reported cost was more than $1.3 billion.\n\nSymphony and Harmony are the latest, biggest vessels in Royal Caribbean's Oasis Class series. Two other Oasis Class ships, Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, debuted in 2009 and 2010, respectively.\n\nThe Oasis Class vessels have made waves in the cruise industry since they began debuting in 2009. All of the Oasis Class ships are in excess of 225,000 tons \u2014 more than 30% larger than the next largest cruise vessels.\n\nWith the addition of Symphony of the Seas, Royal Caribbean has 25 ships.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/11/09/symphony-seas-largest-cruise-ship-ever-begins-trips-miami/1942918002/", "CLOSE Matthew Whitaker was previous Jeff Sessions' chief of staff. Sessions submitted his resignation on Wednesday, one day after the 2018 midterm elections. USA TODAY\n\nAs dean of the Belmont University School of Law, Alberto Gonzales, the former U.S. attorney general, tells \" 'Don't go to Washington thinking you'll be treated fairly.' I tell them, 'Go in with your eyes open and your armor on.' \" Here, Gonzales addresses the Tennessee YMCA Youth in Government at the state capitol on Friday, March 20, 2015, in Nashville. (Photo: George Walker IV, The Tennessean)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Two former attorneys general are questioning the propriety of Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general, suggesting that President Donald Trump may have skirted established rules of succession to install the former Iowa federal prosecutor.\n\nIn interviews with USA TODAY, Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, who both served in the George W. Bush administration, aligned themselves Friday with a contingent of legal analysts who assert that the post should have been filled by a Justice Department official who has been confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cEven Richard Nixon didn\u2019t put in somebody as acting attorney general who had not been confirmed,\u201d Mukasey said, referring to the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, when Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned after defying Nixon\u2019s order to fire special Watergate prosecutor Archibold Cox. Solicitor General Robert Bork ultimately agreed to carry out Nixon\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cThe successor needs to be a confirmed person, in my view,\" Mukasey said.\n\nGonzales said questions over Whitaker\u2019s authority will likely have to be resolved in court.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the (Trump) administration did the Justice Department any favors\u201d by installing Whitaker. \u201cBeyond the legal questions, I don\u2019t think it was a good idea.\u201d\n\nWhitaker, who had been serving as chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was appointed to the interim position Wednesday following the ouster of Sessions.\n\nWhile Sessions' departure was long-expected because of a fractured relationship with the White House, Whitaker's installation has drawn increasing scrutiny both because his position is not subject to Senate confirmation and for his past public statements questioning the legitimacy of the ongoing inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWhitaker, in his new interim role as the chief law enforcement officer in the country, now has oversight of the Russia inquiry headed by Justice special counsel Robert Mueller. Until Whitaker's appointment, the Mueller investigation was being managed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nWhite House departures: Who's been fired and who resigned\n\nJeff Sessions out as attorney general: Here's what we know\n\nRelated: Court presses DOJ on how Sessions ouster could affect Mueller probe\n\nThe duty fell to Rosenstein last year after Sessions recused himself because of his work for the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Justice Department Friday maintained that Whitaker's appointment was appropriate.\n\nQuestions about Whitaker's authority, however, began emerging immediately after his elevation was announced in a tweet by the president.\n\nBefore joining the department last year, Whitaker had been a vocal surrogate for Trump while variously calling for Justice to limit the scope of the Mueller investigation. The past criticism, including his suggestion that Justice could choke off funding for the probe, prompted concerns from Democrats and some Republican lawmakers who have since thrown threw support behind proposed legislation to shield the special counsel.\n\nAt the same time, legal analysts \u2013 including Neal Katyal, an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, and George Conway, spouse of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway \u2013 seized on Whitaker's appointment as bypassing the Senate confirmation processed required of Cabinet officials.\n\n\"Because Mr. Whitaker has not undergone the process of Senate confirmation, there has been no mechanism for scrutinizing whether he has the character and the ability to evenhandedly enforce the law in a position of such grave responsibility,\" Katyal and Conway wrote in a New York Times column.\n\n\"The public is entitled to that assurance, especially since Mr. Whitaker's only supervisor is Mr. Trump himself, and the president is hopelessly compromised by the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nIronically, one of the most recent leadership shuffles at Justice occurred during the early days of the Trump administration, when then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a Senate-confirmed holdover from the Obama administration, was fired by Trump for refusing to defend the president's travel ban.\n\nThe post was filled by Dana Boente, a confirmed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nShould he recuse?\n\nMukasey and Gonzales, who both questioned Whitaker's standing as a non-confirmed appointee, disagreed over whether the acting attorney general should recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller inquiry.\n\n\"I don't think he should recuse,\" Mukasey said. \"These are past statements. The question is whether he is suited for the job.\"\n\nGonzales, who faced his own political storm over the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in a dispute that triggered his resignation, said Whitaker's past statements potentially create the \"appearance of bias\" in the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"Any appearance of bias hurts the department,\" he said. \"If it were me, I would step away,\" Gonzales said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, sent mixed signals on Whitaker on Friday.\n\nBefore departing to France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, Trump claimed not to know his new Justice chief.\n\nMore: Donald Trump: 'I don't know Matt Whitaker'\n\nRelated: Kellyanne Conway's husband calls Trump's promotion of Whitaker 'unconstitutional'\n\n\"I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump said in his first public remarks since the appointment. \"Matt Whitaker has a great reputation, and that's what I wanted.\"\n\nTrump's remarks directly contradicted comments he made a month ago when he heaped praise on Whitaker.\n\n\"I can tell you Matt Whitaker's a great guy,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News. \"I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\"\n\nTrump claimed Friday that he had no contact with Whitaker regarding the Russia investigation, which the president has repeatedly derided as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"I didn't speak to Matt Whitaker about it,\" Trump told reporters on the White House lawn.\n\n\"When Sessions left, what I did, very simply, is take a man who worked for Sessions,\" the president said. \"He's a highly respected man, especially by law enforcement.

(Photo: Brad Rempel, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Joe Mauer is retiring after 15 major league seasons, six All-Star games, three Gold Glove awards, three batting titles and 2,123 career hits, all with his hometown Minnesota Twins.\n\n\"Thank you, Minnesota Twins, and thank you, fans, for making my career as special and memorable as it was,\" Mauer wrote in a full-page ad that will run Sunday in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. \"Because of you I can leave the game I love with a full and grateful heart.\"\n\nMauer's eight-year, $184 million contract expired the day after the World Series ended, creating a natural parting from the game he grew up with in St. Paul, less than 10 miles from the downtown Minneapolis ballparks he called home with the Twins.\n\n\"The decision came down to my health and my family,\" Mauer wrote. \"The risk of a concussion is always there, and I was reminded of that this season when I missed 30 games as a result of diving for a foul ball. That's all it took this time around and it was all I need to bring me back to the struggles I faced in 2013.\"\n\nJoe Mauer has announced his retirement. Here's the letter the Twins have released to the fans from their long-time star: pic.twitter.com/YD6GqGE7Xf \u2014 Mark Feinsand (@Feinsand) November 9, 2018\n\nThe first overall pick in the 2001 draft out of Cretin-Derham Hall High School, the same program that produced Hall of Famer Paul Molitor, Mauer made his debut at the Metrodome on April 5, 2004, two weeks before his 21st birthday. He signed his megadeal three weeks before the Twins began playing at Target Field.\n\nMauer acknowledged down the stretch this season he wasn't sure yet whether he was interested in continuing to play, with twin 5-year-old daughters at home and a third child on the way for him and his wife, Maddie. Then came the final game of the season on Sept. 30, when he doubled in his last at-bat and donned his catcher's gear to symbolically take one more pitch in the top of the ninth inning as he tearfully waved to the adorning crowd. Not many players could experience a farewell more poignant than that.\n\nWhat made the moment so emotional was the fact that Mauer hadn't been behind the plate since Aug. 19, 2013, when a foul tip banged off his mask and triggered a concussion that forced him to move to first base\n\n\"The concussion I experienced that season not only changed my life professionally with a move to first base, but changed me personally as well,\" Mauer wrote.\n\nWhile his athleticism \u2014 he had a scholarship waiting for him to play quarterback at Florida State and was a sharpshooting guard on the basketball team in high school \u2014 allowed for a relatively smooth transition on defense, the effects of the head injury robbed him of his prowess at the plate for most of the next three years.\n\nAs a catcher, easily the game's most demanding and dangerous position, Mauer's offensive ability was Hall of Fame-worthy. In 2006, he became the first catcher to lead the league in batting average since 1942. He did so again in 2008 and in 2009, when he hit .365 with a .444 on-base percentage and a .587 slugging percentage to top the AL in all three categories and win the MVP award. In Mauer's last 10 games as a catcher before the concussion in 2013, he went 17 for 43 with three doubles, three homers and nine RBIs.\n\nStaying healthy became a challenge, however, and his popularity lessened some in a state usually fiercely proud of homegrown players due to the size of his contract and the amount of his absences.\n\nA knee injury limited his rookie season to 35 games, and a strained left quadriceps had him on the disabled list for more than a month in 2007. Back trouble sidelined him for all of April in 2009, when Mauer still managed to hit 28 home runs, by far his career high. In 2011, soreness and weakness in both of his legs kept him out for more than two months.\n\nMore: MLB owners to vote next week on commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s future\n\nMore: Bryce Harper will sign with the Phillies. You can bank on it.\n\nMoving to first base allowed him to play more often, but between 2014 and 2016 his cumulative average was just .267 and the three highest strikeout totals of his career came in each of those seasons.\n\nHis renaissance came in 2017 as the Twins went from 59-103 to 85-77 and a spot in the AL wild card game, batting .305 with 36 doubles, the second-highest total of his career. That made it easy to see Mauer playing beyond 2018, but in the end he opted to walk away with a .306 batting average and a place in the top five on the team's career lists in a clear majority of offensive categories. Mauer is their all-time leader in doubles and times on base and second in hits behind Kirby Puckett.", "", "", "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Historically, Tom Brady has been hesitant to express satisfaction when it comes to the Patriots' offense.\n\nHis approach has remained unchanged this season about a group that only recently has started to find consistency after a 1-2 start. The passing attack particularly has suffered during that time because of his lack of cohesion with a new group of receivers.\n\nBrady didn't eclipse 300 yards passing in any of New England's first three games, averaging 208 yards through the air with six total touchdowns.\n\nThings have changed during the Patriots' current six-game win streak, in which Brady has averaged 308 yards per game and thrown 11 TDs.\n\nIt's progress, Brady said, but what he hopes is only a glimpse at where they can be as the Patriots prepare for Sunday's matchup at Tennessee.\n\n\"I don't think we're there. Certainly not. I think we need some more time together,\" he said Friday. \"We need to be kind of battle-tested in these games.\"\n\nWhile Brady credits the entire offense's dedication in the film room and its attention to detail in game plans, the acquisition of receiver Josh Gordon in Week 3 and return of Julian Edelman after missing last season with a torn right ACL have been big factors.\n\nGordon has shown a different facet of his athleticism each week. He posted his best game in a Patriots uniform in last week's win over the Packers, finishing with five catches for 130 yards and a touchdown. The score came on a 55-yard catch-and-run that gave New England some needed distance on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter. It was his second 55-yard catch this season.\n\nIn six games with New England, Gordon has 22 catches for 396 yards and two TDs.\n\nLikewise, Edelman has started to look like the go-to target Brady has depended on in recent years. He followed his first 100-yard receiving game of the season at Buffalo in Week 8 with six catches for 71 yards against Green Bay.\n\n\"I think his mental and physical toughness are just unmatched in a lot of ways,\" Brady said of Edelman. \"I have so much confidence in him. He really does all the dirty work for us, you know? He's so scrappy and goes in there and blocks hard, catches balls over the middle. We put him in a lot of different positions and he always seems to come through for us.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of his trade Gordon said he had no doubt he was going to take advantage of the opportunity with the Patriots following a tumultuous tenure with the Browns that included his receiving treatment for drug and alcohol dependence, and several suspensions.\n\nHe has flourished in New England's strict environment, which he called comfortable and \"a real home.\" He's also benefited from building a quick rapport with Brady.\n\n\"It's great that he has a certain amount of trust in me to put it in my direction,\" Gordon said. \"And, I just want to come down and make a play on it.\"\n\nBrady said Gordon, who debuted in the Week 4 win over Miami, has exceeded expectations.\n\n\"I think he's done really everything the coaches have asked him to do. Here early, stays late, always getting extra reps at practice, takes as many reps as he can, and it's been fun to see,\" he said.\n\nIt's all helped mask a drop-off in production this season by tight end Rob Gronkowski, who has missed two of the last three games with ankle and back injuries. He has 29 catches for 448 yards, but has only one TD on the season.\n\nGronk is officially listed as questionable for Sunday after being limited in practice all week. He declined to say if he thought he was physically ready to play, adding the decision of whether he traveled to Nashville or suited up was not his own.\n\n\"It's up to the coaches,\" he said.\n\nWhatever personnel Brady has available to him, he is adamant that there's still another level for this offense to reach before season's end.\n\n\"Things that we do well we're going to keep building on, and things that we're not doing well, you try them maybe a different year or different players,\" he said. \"We're still trying to figure those things out.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Robert Franklin) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Notre Dame didn't need any heroics from Arike Ogunbowale in its season opener. Three efficient quarters was more than enough.\n\nOgunbowale scored 30 points in 25 minutes before sitting out the fourth quarter as the top-ranked Irish opened their national title defense with a 103-58 victory over Harvard on Friday.\n\nOgunbowale, who hit two buzzer-beaters last spring at the Women's Final Four to give the Irish their second national championship under coach Muffet McGraw, made 10 of 21 field goals and all nine free throws in 25 minutes, and she's not dwelling on last season, which earned her an ESPY award and an appearance on \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\n\n\"It's going to be nice to see it (the national championship banner) up there, but we need to move on,\" Ogunbowale said.\n\nJessica Shepard had 28 points on 12-of-16 shooting to go with eight rebounds before joining Ogunbowale on the bench in the fourth quarter after playing 27 minutes. Brianna Turner, who sat out all of last season with an ACL injury, had 11 points and 11 rebounds in 21 minutes. Forward Mikayla Vaughn, another player returning from ACL surgery, finished with 12 points.\n\n\"We've still got a long way to go,\" said McGraw, who now has 801 wins as she begins her 32nd season in South Bend. \"I thought Jess was hard to guard inside, I think we can get the ball to Bri more and Arike got a lot of good shots off ball screens.\"\n\nSydney Skinner, whose 3-pointer in the first minute gave Harvard its only lead, led the Crimson (0-1) with 15 points, all from long distance.

She went without it in the second half.\n\nHarvard: The Crimson finished 18-11 last season and received a berth in the WNIT for their 14th postseason appearance, the most of any Ivy League team. Harvard was picked to finish third in an Ivy League preseason poll behind first choice Princeton and Penn. Four of last year's five top scorers return, led by co-captains Skinner and Madeline Raster.\n\nSTATS\n\nThe Irish outrebounded the Crimson 55-30, had six blocks (four by Vaughn) and made 24 assists on their 37 baskets with Young and Ogunbowale having five each. For the game, Notre Dame shot 55.2 percent (37 of 67).\n\nWhat really pleased McGraw was Notre Dame's defense. The Irish held the Crimson to 29.2 percent shooting (21 of 72) though Harvard went 11 of 34 (32.4 percent) from 3-point range.\n\nOgunbowale, who guarded Skinner, did hear it from her coach.\n\n\"Coach told me I couldn't guard her,\" Ogunbowale laughed. \"So I tried to step it up in the second half.\"\n\nUNHAPPY HOMECOMING\n\nRaster played prep basketball two miles south of the Purcell Pavilion at Saint Joseph High School. It was not a good homecoming for Raster, who was kicked in the head by Turner going for a loose ball in the third quarter. After being examined, she went to the bench and did not return. She finished with five points in 13 minutes.\n\n\"She's going to be fine \u2014 she's tough,\" Delaney-Smith said. \"Yeah, it was pretty unfair because we needed her. But that's OK. Life isn't fair sometimes, right?\"\n\nT'D UP AND TEED OFF\n\nDelaney-Smith, who has been Harvard's head coach for 37 seasons, finally had enough with what she thought was a disparity in the personal fouls called. So with 1:45 left to play, she let the officiating crew know about it \u2014 and received a technical.\n\n\"I honestly believe the imbalance in the foul calls was an atrocity,\" she said. \"All I said to the official was 'home cooking.' That's ridiculous. Ironically, after I said it, we got five calls. I need to learn to get a technical sooner.\"\n\nThe Crimson finished with 27 fouls to Notre Dame's nine.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHarvard: Visits Purdue Sunday before returning home to play La Salle on Wednesday.\n\nNotre Dame: Penn visits Monday, when the Irish will hoist their 2018 NCAA championship banner.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy ended his near two-week silence by saying he wanted to keep his frustrations to himself in what's been a miserable season.\n\n\"I was just upset how everything's been going, 2-7,\" McCoy said Friday, referring to the Bills' record. \"That's frustrating. I want to win games, so I just kind of took that approach. Just kind of upset. But my mindset is just try to get better.\"\n\nThe comments were the first from McCoy since a 25-6 loss against New England on Oct. 29. He's ducked interview requests ever since, including canceling his weekly news conferences each of the past two Wednesdays after combining for 23 yards rushing on 22 carries over two games.\n\n\"There's plays to be made and we're not making them. Got to play smarter. Got to play better. Simple as that,\" McCoy said. \"Can't complain or pout about it. Just got to find ways to win games and make it happen.\"\n\nWhat bothers him even more is that at 30 , McCoy is beginning to realize he's running out of time to achieve various objectives. They include winning a championship and establishing himself as one of the NFL's premier running backs by becoming just the 17th player to reach 12,000 career yards rushing.\n\n\"Oh, it'll take a little longer than I expect now,\" said McCoy, whose 267 yards rushing this season have upped his career total to 10,359.\n\n\"The urgency is up. I want to win now. I want to add on to my legacy of course, a chance to get a ring. And those things are on my mind,\" McCoy said. \"So the frustration about losing, all them things, every player has a clock.\"\n\nIn getting off to the worst start of a season in his 10-year career, McCoy hasn't reached the end zone since scoring twice in a 24-17 win over Miami on Dec. 17. And he hasn't topped 100 yards since finishing with 156 on a snow-covered field in a 13-7 overtime win against Indianapolis on Dec. 10.\n\nAt the rate the Bills' anemic offense is producing in having scored an NFL-worst 96 points, McCoy wasn't making any promises when the droughts might end with Buffalo preparing to play at the New York Jets on Sunday.\n\n\"I don't have the answers, why and when, but I just look forward to getting there,\" he said. \"Just got to find a way to do it.\"\n\nMcCoy didn't want his frustrations to be interpreted as him being unhappy to still be in Buffalo after the NFL's trading deadline passed on Oct. 30. And he's pleased to hear general manager Brandon Beane say McCoy remains in the team's plans through the final year of his contract next season.\n\n\"They've been good to me. I'm a loyal person, and I'm happy here,\" said McCoy, in his fourth season in Buffalo since being acquired in a trade with Philadelphia. \"I think sometimes people get that mixed up with the frustrations of losing. But for me to be in their plans, I like the way that sounds.\"\n\nBeane told The Associated Press this week he maintains his confidence in McCoy's ability.\n\n\"We don't see a guy who's a declining player. We see a guy who's still playing well, and he's one of the better players at his position in the league,\" Beane said. \"He is working hard. He's trying to be the best he can. And he's going to continue to do that. And if he wasn't, then we probably would've moved on.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Khalil Mack will save some secrets for the Detroit Lions on Sunday at Soldier Field.\n\nAsked if he would be 100 percent healthy or hindered by the sprained right ankle he suffered Oct. 14, the Chicago Bears' pass rusher smiled on Friday, but hedged.\n\n\"You want me to give up everything?\" Mack said. \"When I get there, I'm going to try to be myself.\"\n\nIf that means 100 percent healthy, it could be a problem for Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford \u2014 especially after the Lions (3-5) gave up 10 sacks to the Minnesota Vikings last week.\n\nMack has been out two weeks but practiced Friday to complete three straight days of full work.

Sage bundles, along with other herbs or incense, have been traditionally burned in many cultures as part of religious ceremonies. Burning sage (sometimes called \u201csmudging\u201d) is a part of some Native American ceremonies and has been widely adopted by others as a part of their own private spiritual practices.\n\nBeing of mixed Mexican and Yaqui heritage, Cano-Murillo\u2019s family has always embraced their Native culture. A meaningful part of that, she says, is making and burning sage bundles at special times throughout the year, with their good intentions centered around love and respect for the ceremony\u2019s roots.\n\nBurning sage is considered sacred. If you are inspired, Cano-Murillo encourages you to research the origins. If you decide sage burning is not appropriate for your family, here are some alternatives to creating your own special practice of attracting good energy and releasing the negativity this holiday season:\n\nLight a candle of good faith\n\nBurn sweet-smelling incense\n\nWrite down affirmations and share them with your family\n\nHere is how Cano-Murillo makes her sage bundles.

(AP) \u2014 Packers receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling turned to Twitter to give a tutorial about how to pronounce his first name.\n\nGet it straight: It's \"mar-QUEZ\" and not \"mar-KEZ.\"\n\n\"It happens all the time,\" Valdes-Scantling said this week about the mispronunciation. \"So there is no 'k' in my name.\"\n\nKeep making highlight-reel plays and announcers will catch on soon enough and get it right.\n\nThe fifth-round selection out of South Florida is about to get more consistent playing time after Geronimo Allison went on injured reserve this week. Green Bay hosts the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.\n\nThis is quite the impression that Valdes-Scantling has left the last few weeks, with breakaway speed and a 6-foot-4 frame that allow him to snare jump balls.\n\n\"The biggest thing is just him gaining the trust of (quarterback Aaron Rodgers) as fast as he has,\" veteran wideout Randall Cobb said. \"It's really impressive that Aaron wants to come to him in certain situations. He's making those plays for him.\"\n\nTo the tune of 17 catches for 358 yards and two scores so far for Valdes-Scantling, plus a team-high 21.1 yards per catch. He has touchdown catches in two of his last four games, with 100 yards receiving in each of the other two games during that span.\n\nThe production increase is in part due to helping fill in for Allison and Cobb while each player missed a few games with hamstring injuries. Cobb is questionable again for the Dolphins game because of hamstring trouble.\n\nThat leaves more opportunities for Valdes-Scantling to be the second receiver behind Davante Adams.\n\nThe process of gaining Rodgers' trust, though, isn't easy. It requires more than just making catches.\n\n\"It's not going to happen in one day. You've got to learn the plays, you've got to know the plays,\" Valdes-Scantling said. \"He's going to quiz you in practice, so you've just got to know all those things. It just happens over time.\"\n\nProof of the payoff came late in the third quarter of last week's loss at New England, with the game tied at 17. Deep in Packers territory, Rodgers rolled right, where he quickly found two defenders trying to close in on him for a sack.\n\nThe two-time NFL MVP threw a high pass that traveled about 30 yards to Valdes-Scantling at around the 36. The rookie adjusted near the sideline to the throw while on the run. With a defender a couple steps behind him, Valdes-Scantling turned and jumped high for the catch .\n\nHe's the breakout contributor of the three receivers taken by the Packers in the draft.\n\nFourth-rounder J'Mon Moore has just one catch for 10 yards. Sixth-rounder Equanimeous St. Brown has seven catches for 143 yards, and moves up in the depth chart behind Valdes-Scantling.\n\n\"At the end of the day, (Valdes-Scantling) has been given some opportunities, probably more than we all anticipated due to the injury, and he's just delivered,\" coach Mike McCarthy said. \"So you can see with the success and the production he's had, his confidence grows more and more each week.\"\n\nNOTES: RT Bryan Bulaga (knee) and LB Blake Martinez (ankle) are also questionable for Sunday.

Pittsburgh (6-2-1) set a record for the most points by an NFL team in the 17-year history of Heinz Field while rolling to a fifth straight victory. The reward? Five days off to rest up before starting a daunting final stretch that begins on Nov. 18 in Jacksonville in a playoff rematch that saw the Jaguars stun Pittsburgh at home in January.\n\n\"Last year is last year,\" Steelers cornerback Mike Hilton said. \"We're a different team just like they're a different team.\"\n\nIf anything, Pittsburgh looks much better than while getting pushed around by Leonard Fournette and Blake Bortles in a confidence-shaking 45-42 setback that led to an exodus in both the secondary and portions of the coaching staff.\n\nRandy Fichtner took over for Todd Haley as offensive coordinator and, even with star running back Le'Veon Bell sitting out due to concerns with his one-year contract, has put together an attack that looks as dynamic and varied as anything in the league.\n\nJames Conner, Bell's replacement, already has 11 touchdowns through nine games, as many as Bell has scored in any full season. Roethlisberger spread the ball all over the place on a night he finished with more scoring passes (five) than incompletions (three).\n\n\"We've got a lot of weapons on this team and Ben showed it tonight getting the ball to all of them,\" DeCastro said.\n\nRoethlisberger's only complaint is that Fichtner may get a little too loud in the headset because he's so pumped up about the next play call.\n\nPittsburgh's defense kept Carolina's Cam Newton under wraps, sacking him five times while limiting the Panthers to 242 yards, the fourth straight game an opponent has finished with 275 yards or less. Save for a couple of early communication breakdowns that allowed Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey to get loose, the Steelers kept things tight.\n\n\"I don't think it's a come-to-Jesus moment where something miraculously just happened,\" defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. \"I think everybody got back to work. It showed on the practice field and it showed ever since. This is a big win, but it's not like we don't have games after this. We'll enjoy it for tonight and enjoy it for the weekend, but when we get back in we have to get back to work.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

More than 10 million people yearly come to visit this only-in-LA attraction, according to the local Chamber of Commerce, which says Venice is the No. 2 tourist draw in Southern California to Disneyland.\n\nAnd why not? A visit for four to Disneyland could easily top $450 before the family has even walked through the gates. In Venice, the show is free \u2013 as long as you can snag a parking spot (it can be done) or set aside $10 or $20 for a parking lot.\n\nAmong Venice's highlights for visitors: body builders on Muscle Beach, the former home of future action star and governor Arnold Schwarzenegger; the skate park, the only one we know of with an ocean view; and street performers, including everyone from the guy who dons his roller skates every morning and patrols up and down Ocean Front Walk playing the electric guitar to a team of acrobats doing multiple somersaults.\n\nAnd for those who like old-fashioned beach activities, there's always the surf, a popular pier and walks in the sand.\n\nVenice Beach is also a haven for art lovers. The more outgoing neighbor to tony Santa Monica is an art show in itself and beyond what you see in the storefronts and product booths. Look up and you'll also find a dizzying array of colors and hues everywhere. There are murals depicting former Venice Beach notables such as the late Jim Morrison, the lead singer from the Doors, to Venice founder Abbot Kinney, shown against a backdrop of his man-made canals and bridges. You'll find giant portraits of dogs on the outside of homes, giant flowers painted over a dry cleaning store, wild collections of images and characters jumping out on local walls and a depiction of the Orson Welles 1958 film \"Touch of Evil\" (which was partially shot in Venice) in a parking lot.\n\nIn fact, there's so much to see in Venice, we had to break it up into two separate photo tours. See the slideshow above for the colorful street scenes and people watching, and you'll find an assortment of evocative murals and street art below.\n\nBut a quick word of caution: Be careful on your visit. While Venice is fun and exciting, it also has a very large homeless population and more crime than its neighbors in Santa Monica and Marina del Rey.\n\nVenice looks cool at night but is perhaps safer during the day.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/11/09/venice-beach-california-street-scenes-public-art/1898383002/", "Arizona State running back Eno Benjamin (3) runs by Utah defensive back Jaylon Johnson (1) for a touchdown in the second half during an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Tempe, Ariz. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 After consecutive wins over USC and Utah, Arizona State finds itself in the thick of the Pac-12 South race. The Sun Devils need a victory over UCLA on Saturday to stay there.\n\nArizona State (5-4, 3-3) would win the Pac-12 South title by beating UCLA, Oregon and Arizona in its final three games of the season.\n\nFirst come the Bruins (2-7, 2-4), who have struggled in their first season under coach Chip Kelly and are coming off a 42-21 loss at Oregon in Kelly's return to Eugene, where he once led the Ducks to national prominence.\n\nArizona State coach Herm Edwards, also in his first year on the job, said his team faces a big challenge.\n\n\"I told our players after the (Utah) game that they have never won three straight. That was the challenge I offered to them,\" he said. \"I did not know what they were all excited about because they had not won three in a row. Maybe I should be giddy, but it is always the next game for me.\"\n\nThis will be the final home game for 16 Arizona State seniors, including quarterback Manny Wilkins. It also likely is the last at home for dynamic wide receiver N'Keal Harry, one of the best in the country who is widely expected to leave school for the NFL.\n\n\"N'Keal Harry is probably the best receiver that we'll face all year long and we faced some really good ones at Oklahoma,\" Kelly said, \"but he's a really difficult matchup because not only is he athletic, he's the biggest guy we're going to play.\"\n\nHere are some things to ponder when the Bruins meet the Sun Devils in an early start (noon, MST) on Saturday.\n\nEXPLOSIVE TRIO: Wilkins, Harry and running back Eno Benjamin all had big games in Arizona State's 38-20 victory over then-No. 16 Utah last weekend.\n\nWilkins completed 19 of 24 passes for 285 yards and three touchdowns, with one interception. Harry caught nine passes for 161 yards and those three TDs. Benjamin gained 175 yards and scored two TDs in 27 carries.\n\nIn all, Arizona State gained 536 yards, by far the most given up this season by the Utes, who entered the game with the No. 1-ranked defense in the Pac-12.\n\nWHO'S THE QB?: Freshman Dorian Thompson-Robinson, bothered by a shoulder injury, returned to start against Oregon but didn't finish the game. Senior transfer Wilton Speight is the other option. Thompson-Robinson returned to practice this week. Kelly said Thompson-Robinson is medically cleared to play but wouldn't say who would start.\n\nSpeight completed 12 of 25 for 147 yards and a touchdown against Oregon. Thompson-Robinson was just 9-of-23 for 135 yards and a TD, with one interception, before leaving the game.\n\nBENJAMIN RUNS: Expect to see a lot of Benjamin against the Bruins, who rank 107th in the nation in rushing defense. Two games ago, Utah's Zack Moss rushed for 211 yards and three touchdowns in the Utes' 41-10 win at UCLA.\n\nBenjamin, meanwhile, has rushed for 1,113 yards this season, with three games to go. He needs only 117 yards to pass Ryan Torain's mark for most yards by an Arizona State running back in the school's Pac-12 era.\n\nWILKINS CAREER: Wilkins is a three-year starter who's had four offensive coordinators.\n\nHe said it will be an emotional day playing in his final game at Sun Devil Stadium.\n\n\"I've put (in) a lot of hard work, a lot of dedication, and I grew up tremendously here,\" Wilkins said. \"This place will forever be special to me. I know when I walk out of that tunnel for the last time it's going to be hard to comprehend it.\"\n\nBRUINS OFFENSE: As one-sided as the score was, UCLA did outgain Oregon 496 yards to 492. The difference was three turnovers \u2014 one interception and two lost fumbles.\n\nThe Bruins' Joshua Kelley rushed for 161 yards and a touchdown in 26 carries.\n\n\"This is a good football team,\" Edwards said. \"They can move the ball. They can do some things on defense to discourage you. We have to be prepared, there are a lot of distractions like Senior Day. All these things become part of how do you deal with that, and I think so far I think our players are focused on football on the field.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Fans of River and Boca Juniors are preparing for the two-leg Copa Libertadores final that will be played on Nov. 10 and Nov. 24. Argentine media have called it: \"The Game of the Century.\" (AP photo/ Luis Andres Henao) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Gonzalo Raffo is a die-hard Boca Juniors fan. His wife, Delfina Foramitti, passionately roots for River Plate.\n\nThey watch every soccer game together wearing the colors of the clubs that are known for holding one of the most intense rivalries in the world. Sometimes they bet: whoever loses must do all the house chores. The winner gets to relax. They also taunt each other. Sometimes, the trash-talk gets so heated at home that they'll end up in an argument. But the stakes are higher than ever now.\n\nIt's the first time that Argentina's two biggest teams will meet in the final of the Copa Libertadores, South America's equivalent of the Champions League. Like many Argentines, the married couple agrees that the final is nothing but historic. But they also fear that these two clubs that divide a nation could also divide their own family.\n\n\"This is more intense than the World Cup,\" Foramitti said, sitting next to her husband on the white couch where they religiously follow the games on TV.\n\n\"Of course I'm nervous because I'm a huge fan of River, but I'm more worried about him because the dishes will fly in this house (if Boca loses) and I can't take his bad mood.\"\n\nRaffo chimed in: \"As long as Boca wins, nothing's going to happen!\" he said, laughing.\n\nThink Red Sox vs. Yankees, Celtics vs. Lakers and Barcelona vs. Real Madrid all rolled into one, and you still might not be doing it justice.\n\n\"Think of the two biggest teams playing in the Super Bowl and it would still be half of this. Argentines are mad about soccer and these are the two greatest clubs of Argentina,\" Raffo said.\n\nThe couple felt silent, and then reflected: \"It will be a new country the day after,\" he said, solemnly. \"I'd say this could destroy families. Divorce is on the line,\" she said, half-jokingly.\n\nThe first leg will be played Saturday at Boca's home stadium, an intimidating ground known as \"La Bombonera\" \u2014 \"The Chocolate Box\" \u2014 for its tightly enclosed shape that looks like boxes stacked on top of each other. The second leg will be on Nov. 24 at River's Monumental de Nunez Stadium, where Argentina won its first World Cup in 1978.\n\n\"Every Boca-River game is important but this is truly the game of the century,\" said 70-year-old Carlos Zinola, who has owned the Don Carlos restaurant in front of Boca's stadium for nearly 50 years and who has attended countless derbies. \"It's the eternal glory for the winner or the clamorous failure for the loser.\"\n\nVisiting fans will not be allowed at either match because of the fear of violence. It's been that way since 2013 and not even a plea from Argentine President Mauricio Macri, a former Boca president, could change it. But that has not kept Macri from giving his views as a Boca fan. He said it will take \"20 years\" to recover from a defeat, and he even heated up the game when he recently called River coach Marcelo Gallardo by a vulgar term.\n\nThe rivalry is everywhere: A couple named their newborn Enzo \"River Plate\" Bejarano. Cardiologists warned against a game that could be too dangerous for the faint of heart. A man reportedly said he was ready to postpone his marriage because it coincided with the game. Another one prepared for the final by painting his dog in his club's colors.\n\nUnconfirmed reports said Russian President Vladimir Putin will arrive before a planned G20 meeting in Buenos Aires just so he can watch the final that Argentine media have called \"The Game of the Century.\"\n\nArgentina's most successful teams originated in the docks of the southern working-class Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca and their rivalry dates back to the early 20th century.\n\nBoca was founded by a group of Italian immigrants who chose the blue and yellow club colors after the flag of a Swedish ship that arrived in port. River, with its white shirt and diagonal red stripe, moved to a northern affluent neighborhood during the league's beginnings. The derby's gritty play, with its passionate fans and colorful celebrations, was once ranked by British newspaper The Observer in its top spot of the 50 sporting things you must do before you die.\n\n\"This is like having a child \u2014 you can never abandon a child,\" said Matias Chamorro, 33, a hardcore River fan who posed for a picture showing the club tattoo on his right shoulder while he paid for his monthly club fee at the stadium ahead of the game. \"You save money to eat, pay for electricity and (natural) gas bills, and you come watch River.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Call Odell Beckham Jr. the eternal optimist.\n\nWhen the New York Giants' flashy wide receiver was asked Friday what he hoped his 1-7 team would do for the remainder of the season, Beckham didn't pull any punches.\n\n\"I think the goal is to win eight games, go 9-7 and go to the playoffs,\" Beckham said.\n\nEven though no NFL team has ever pulled off such a comeback?\n\n\"It's not an easy task,\" Beckham added. \"But that's the goal. We want to win every game and I want to do everything I can to help that. The Giants have been there before, gone 9-7 and got into the playoffs. Anything is possible. It's not impossible to win eight games. It wasn't impossible to lose seven. Anything can happen.\"\n\nBeckham remained upbeat as his team prepared to face the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, California on Monday night. He was certain his team is ready to turn it around, albeit in miraculous fashion \u2014 provided the Giants do a better job of scoring touchdowns.\n\n\"We've lost a lot of close games that we just didn't pull through,\" Beckham said. \"We know what situations we're in when we are in those close games. We just haven't found a way to pull them through. It's easy to sit up here and be like we want to win eight games knowing that it's very tough to do. You just got to pull it all together now.\n\n\"I know we're not in a very good situation, but you just got to make the most out of that.\"\n\nBeckham signed a five-year, $95 million contract, with approximately $65 million guaranteed, during training camp in August, so he's the new face of the franchise moving forward. He was asked if he felt he had any pressure to be the one who kick-starts the offense.\n\n\"Not any more than I ever have,\" said Beckham, who has caught 61 passes for 785 yards and two touchdowns this season. \"Hopefully I can start catching some of these things and start taking them to the crib, making bigger plays. I put more on myself. Whatever happens is what's going to happen, but I know that my mentality is not going to be to quit. I'm not going to be out there not trying to go hard every play. Any chance that I get, that's just always how I'm going to be.\"\n\nBeckham was also asked if the Giants could eliminate some problems in scoring touchdowns once they get inside the opponent's 20-yard line.\n\n\"I think that any chance I get, and all of us get a chance to take something to the house, it's time to go,\" he said. \"There's no more holding back, playing it safe, or waiting for the next play, because you don't know if you're going to have a next play, and that's just the mentality we have to take. Any chance I get now, and I catch one of these slants, there's no motion wasted. It's just got to be somebody has got to come catch me. You trust your training, you trust your speed \u2014 somebody has got to come catch me. I'm trying as much as I can to make these plays, explosive plays, and we all need to do that.\"\n\nFellow wideout Sterling Shepard also recognizes his team's struggles in the red zone.\n\n\"Explosive plays are always good themselves, but if you can take them all the way, then that obviously is better for the team,\" said Shepard, who has 40 receptions for 542 yards and two touchdowns. \"You just take them as they come and some of them will pop, some of them won't, but an explosive play all around is good for the team. I think it's we're just not being assignment sound. I feel like one guy is always off or two guys off when we get into the red zone, and that can kill your chances of scoring.\"\n\nBeckham Jr. is befuddled why the Giants aren't scoring more.\n\n\"Not to say that the opportunities haven't been there, but they've been limited,\" he noted.\n\nBut Beckham feels the tide is about to turn for him personally.\n\n\"I don't know, but towards the back end of the season, I feel like I do better,\" Beckham said. \"As the season goes on, people's bodies start to break down. I really try to maintain and I really try to be better than I was in Week 1 or Week 10. I feel a lot stronger going in towards the back end of the season. I feel like I'm in the best shape of my life. Now, it's just time to do that.\"\n\nNOTES: Coming off a bye, the Giants had a full team at practice Friday. WR Jawill Davis (concussion), who had been out, returned to practice, so he will more than likely be the Giants' main return option on punts and kickoffs Monday. Starting LB Alec Ogletree (hamstring) returned to practice, as did OT Chad Wheeler (ankle). . Olivier Vernon said that there was no difference in preparing to face 49ers QB Nick Mullens, who will be making the second start of his pro career. \"We have to disrupt him and make him feel uncomfortable,\" Vernon said. \"There's not a whole lot of film to watch on him, so we just have to have the mindset to get after him and get him out of a comfort zone.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: SAEED KHAN, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence leaves Sunday for a week-long tour of Asia, his third trip to the region where the administration has ongoing trade disputes and military issues.\n\nThe White House announced in August that Pence would replace President Donald Trump at a round of economic and security meetings in Singapore and Papua New Guinea, prompting questions about Trump\u2019s commitment to the Indo-Pacific region where China\u2019s influence dominates.\n\nPence took an aggressive stance against China in an October speech in which he accused the Chinese government of orchestrating a military, economic and political campaign to expand its influence inside the United States and across other regions of the world.\n\nDuring next week\u2019s trip, Pence will \u201chighlight American leadership in the region\u201d and reaffirm Trump\u2019s commitment to denuclearizing North Korea, according to spokeswoman Alyssa Farah.\n\n\u201cHe will also deliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression and the disregard for other nations\u2019 sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States,\u201d Farah said.\n\nSome foreign policy experts have suggested the Trump administration is firing up a new cold war with China, though officials in both countries appear to be trying to tamp down tensions now. On Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis held talks with their Chinese counterparts in Washington.\n\nDuring a joint press conference after their closed-door meeting, Pompeo said he raised the U.S. concerns about China\u2019s aggression in the South China Sea and its widespread repression of religious minorities, particularly Muslims in China's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.\n\nBut, Pompeo said, \u201cthe United States is not pursuing a cold war or containment policy with China.\"\n\nMattis called the diplomatic and security talks a \u201cproductive and positive dialogue.\u201d He said the two countries were working on a \u201ccrisis communication and deconfliction network\u201d to avoid accidental military clashes in the waters around the South China Sea.\n\nChinese Politburo Member Yang Jiechi told reporters that the situation in the South China Sea was \"trending toward greater stability\" but warned the U.S. to stop sending its vessels and military aircraft into the region.\n\nFriday's meeting at the State Department was a preview for Trump's own session with Chinese President Xi Jinping, set for later this month when they are expected to talk on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina.\n\nTrump has a tendency to undercut his own top officials. Weeks after Pence took a tough stance against North Korea during a February visit to South Korea, for example, Trump agreed to an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un.\n\nAsked how much authority Pence has to speak for Trump, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified, said there should be zero question that Pence speaks for the administration.\n\nThe official, who previewed the vice president's trip on a call with reporters, said Pence will unveil substantive initiatives, including bilateral agreements involving the digital economy, energy and infrastructure.\n\nTrump last year pulled out of a sweeping Asia-focused trade deal that President Barack Obama negotiated in part to serve as a counterweight to China's rising economic power. Trump is now in the middle of a trade war with China.\n\nIn his October speech, Pence accused China's Communist Party of using rewards and coercion to influence American businesses, universities, think tanks and government officials. He said, for example, that China threatened to deny a business license for a major American corporation unless it spoke out against the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies.\n\nHe linked those alleged activities to China's broader effort to extend its military and economic power across Asia and Africa.\n\nThe administration is betting that countries in the Indo-Pacific region will benefit more from private investment by American companies than through direct help from China, which has lavished countries across Asia and Africa with billions of dollars in investment and loans.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/09/vice-president-pence-representing-president-trump-asia/1945203002/", "Black Friday 2018: Sears and Kmart announce holiday plans\n\nSears will still have plenty of great Black Friday sales, despite store closings.

(AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The NFL has fined Tennessee Titans safety Kevin Byard $10,026 for celebrating his end-zone interception on the Dallas Cowboys star logo at midfield.\n\nByard said Friday the fine was actually worth it as the interception helped change momentum by denying the Cowboys a possible touchdown. The Titans outscored the Cowboys 28-7 after the interception en route to a 28-14 victory Monday night.\n\n\"I actually kind of expected it to be more with all the crazy fines that are going on in the league right now,\" Byard said. \"I expected it to be more than $10,000. But I feel like it was worth it. I kind of knew it was coming, but I didn't know the amount. ... It was a momentum changer. If it was $10,000 it was worth it, because I'll make that up on the back end.\"\n\nThe 2017 All-Pro safety copied what Terrell Owens did 18 years ago in a win over the Cowboys in old Texas Stadium. The interception was the second this season for Byard and his 10th since the start of the 2017 season, tying him for the most in the NFL in that span.\n\nTitans coach Mike Vrabel talked with Byard after the game and again Tuesday. Vrabel also talked to the rest of the team Wednesday to make sure they understand what is expected of them when celebrating.\n\n\"That's not what we want as an organization, and that's not what I want as a head coach,\" Vrabel said. \"I want our guys to play as hard as they possibly can for each other, between the whistle, and as physical and aggressive and as clean as they possibly can.\"\n\nVrabel said he wants players to celebrate with a teammate.\n\n\"Find somebody else in a Titans uniform. Find a coach, and celebrate with them,\" Vrabel said. \"But we don't need to do that. It's not what we want to do. ... That's not what I want, and if that's what they want, then we see it very differently.\"\n\nNotes: The Titans (4-4) will be without right tackle Jack Conklin (concussion protocol) against the New England Patriots (7-2) on Sunday.

(AP Photo/Don Wright) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Panthers coach Ron Rivera wants his players to get away from football, just for a little while.\n\nA day after a humiliating 52-21 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Carolina's eighth-year coach said it may just be what the Panthers need.\n\n\"Sometimes the best medicine is to forget about it and then come back ready to roll,\" Rivera said Friday, adding that they should focus on something other than football.\n\nThat advice doesn't apply to Rivera and his coaching staff.\n\nRivera said coaches will spend the next few days pouring over game film, looking for solutions and making adjustments, particularly on the offensive and defensive lines where the Panthers were overwhelmed by the Steelers in the road loss. The coach wouldn't say if he's considering any changes to the starting lineup.\n\nQuarterback Cam Newton was sacked five times and threw a crucial pick-six out of desperation to avoid taking a safety in the end zone, while the defense never was able to stop Ben Roethlisberger, who turned in a perfect QB rating (158.3) after throwing for 328 yards and five touchdowns. The 52 points allowed tied the most in franchise history.\n\nThe Panthers (6-3) are still in good shape in the NFC playoff picture, but Rivera expressed concern knowing the NFL is a copycat league and upcoming opponents will look to simulate what the Steelers did against them.\n\n\"It is a beg, borrow and steal league,\" Rivera said. \"Guys are going to look at this tape and see what (the Steelers) did and have answers. We as coaches, as I said, are not done evaluating tape and going through it and trying to correct things.\"\n\nPittsburgh's defense brought more pass rushers than the Panthers were able to block, often resulting in 5-foot-11, 210-pound running back Christian McCaffrey desperately trying to pick up linemen who outweighed him by almost 100 pounds. That didn't go well.\n\nRivera said the Steelers defense threw some new looks at Carolina's revamped offensive line and the guys up front didn't recognize or adjust to them.\n\n\"Sometimes you see things for the first time, things that they do a little differently, with a little twist to them, it makes things difficult,\" Rivera said. \"We have to be able to handle those things. We have to stick to our rules, our base fundamentals.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Carolina's defense failed to generate much of any pressure on Roethlisberger. There were times he danced around in the pocket untouched for nearly 10 seconds.\n\nRivera said that has to change.\n\nHe plans to continue to rotate defensive linemen in and out of the lineup \"until we find something that clicks on the pass rush side.\"\n\nCarolina's stadium was noticeably quiet and somber on a dark, gray afternoon.\n\nAfter what he called a \"very humbling experience to be beat the way we were,\" Rivera still gave players four days off \u2014 as previously planned before the game \u2014 beginning Friday. They'll return to practice Tuesday to begin preparations for the Nov. 18 game at Detroit.\n\nFor some, that wasn't by choice.\n\nTight end Greg Olsen said after the game Thursday night that he wishes the Panthers had a four-day week this week and he could get back on the field to wash this loss out of their mouths instead of waiting 10 days for the next game.\n\n\"We just got thoroughly beaten in a game that we were looking forward to, a game that we thought we could really measure ourselves against one of the better teams in the league,\" Olsen said. \"We got that answer. We got a lot of work to do.\"\n\nNOTES: Rivera said he plans to ask the league for a clarification on why safety Eric Reid was ejected Thursday night after hitting a sliding Roethlisberger on a downfield scramble. Rivera said he agreed Reid should have been penalized, but felt he shouldn't have been kicked out of the game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It's against our ideals to sideline people who want their voices heard.\n\nVoters line up as the polls open at David Park Community Center Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018 in Hollywood, Fla. (Photo: Susan Stocker, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, via AP)\n\nThe hallmark of every true democracy is fair, free and accurate elections. It's what separates us from the dictatorships and totalitarian regimes of other countries. The American people have faith that when they head to the polls to cast a ballot, that vote will be properly accepted and counted.\n\nThe state of Florida is no stranger to close elections. We are still ridiculed in political circles for the debacle following the 2000 presidential election in which Al Gore and George W. Bush battled over hanging chads and butterfly ballots all the way to the Supreme Court. In my very own election to Congress in 2012, it took ballot retabulations and weeks of legal wrangling before I was declared the victor by just over 2,000 votes \u2014 a slim 0.6% margin.\n\nAnd now Florida voters are faced with recounts for three statewide races that are each separated by less than half of a percent \u2014 governor, senator and closest of all, agriculture commissioner, in which the margin between the candidates is in the hundredths of a percent. If it wasn't obvious already, it should be crystal clear that every vote counts.\n\nExcept mine didn't.\n\nMy absentee ballot was declared invalid over my signature\n\nAfter it became clear that several races were too close to call on Tuesday, I decided to check my absentee ballot status on the Palm Beach County elections website \u2013 only to find that my ballot had been rejected because of an \"invalid signature\" mismatch. I've been a registered voter for over 15 years, and an active Palm Beach County voter for six, and yet that wasn't enough to get my ballot added to the official tally.\n\nVoters who get notice in time can sign and return an affidavit that has to be received by 5 p.m. the day before the election. But my vote wasn't actually logged until Election Day, according to the Palm Beach elections website. There is no remedy to my situation after the fact, so unless that's changed by the county canvassing board or a legal challenge filed by Sen. Bill Nelson, the judgment call made by an unelected county employee to reject my vote will stand.\n\nMore: Make voting easier for everybody, not tougher\n\nRepublicans are rigging elections to win. They're anti-voter and anti-democracy.\n\nAfrican-Americans fought, bled and died so we could vote. Shame on us if we don't\n\nI wonder, how many others across the state has this \"mismatch\" scenario affected without their knowledge? Would the single parent working two jobs or the snowbird heading out of town to see family for the holidays see this notice in time to make the correction? For races being decided in the hundreds of votes out of more than 8 million cast, the decision to summarily reject a validly cast ballot is unfathomable.\n\nWe must work to reform this system \u2014 now.\n\nJust this week we made great strides in expanding the right to vote in another important way. Nearly 65% of Floridians chose to extend the franchise to ex-felons who have paid their debt to society. It is refreshing that after President Donald Trump tried to suppress the vote with a nonsensical voter fraud commission, Florida voters from across the political spectrum chose to veer in the opposite direction and encourage more people to participate in the political process.\n\nTreat voting as the most sacred right of all\n\nBut in other ways our system \u2014 not just in Florida, but across the nation \u2014 continues to actively discourage voting. Polling places are shuttered at college campuses purely for political reasons. Early vote centers are underfunded and understaffed to the point where lines are hours long, snaking around city blocks. And voters are often purged from the rolls for missing an election or having minor errors in the spellings of their names or addresses. This is completely antithetical to the democratic ideals that we, as a nation, have fought for.\n\nMy vote on Nov. 6 may not end up being counted. But we have too much at stake at this time in our nation's history \u2014 from the threat of climate change to the disappearing middle class to the scourge of gun violence \u2014 to unfairly push people to the sidelines who want their voices heard. It is imperative that we treat the right to vote as the most sacred right of all.\n\nDemocrat Patrick Murphy represented Florida's 18th Congressional District from 2013 to 2017.

Stone Cold Steve Austin revealed on his podcast, the Steve Austin Show, that he\u2019s stopped drinking to focus on his health.\n\nVia Sports Illustrated:\n\n\u201cMy eating program is going fantastic. [I\u2019m] sticking to my exact macros. [I\u2019ve had] zero alcohol for right at 14 days now\u2026. No alcohol, and when you hit the weights on a consistent basis and eat what you\u2019re supposed to, it is amazing the difference that you can make.\u201d\n\nThere are countless drinking stories from Austin\u2019s days in WWE, but nothing tops the \u201cbeer bash\u201d Austin had with the Dudley Boyz during a trip to Japan.\n\nVia PodcastOne:", "CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Whenever senior defensive tackle Cortez Broughton mentioned the American Athletic Conference championship over the summer, he'd get a look that said, \"Yeah, right.\"\n\nThe Bearcats won only four games each of the last two seasons, so expectations were low heading into coach Luke Fickell's second season. All that has changed.\n\nA 6-0 start got Cincinnati (8-1, 4-1) back into the Top 25 and changed a lot of perceptions. They're in the title chase as mid-November approaches.\n\n\"At the beginning of the season, people didn't think we could go for a championship,\" Broughton said. \"People would ask me, 'What's your goal this year? Win six games? Eight games?' I'd say: conference championship.\"\n\nA victory on Saturday night over South Florida (7-2, 3-2) would keep them in contention. They're second in the AAC East, a game behind UCF (8-0, 5-0). The Bearcats play at UCF the following week in a game that could amount to a showdown for the division \u2014 if they can first get past South Florida.\n\n\"Really, we've talked about putting ourselves in this position,\" Fickell said. \"I think this is what guys are more excited about. It's November and we've put ourselves in position to play for a championship.\"\n\nThey're coming off a 42-0 win over Navy that was perhaps their best all-around game of the season and an encouraging way to open the final month. The young Bearcats don't appear to be feeling any pressure in their chase for a title.\n\n\"Last week was as clean a game as we've played as a team, just really, really clean,\" Fickell said.\n\nThe Bulls wish they could say the same. After a 7-0 start, they've gotten leveled in back-to-back losses that raised questions about their depleted defense. They gave up a school record in points during a 57-36 loss at Houston, followed by a 41-15 drubbing at home against Tulane last week.\n\n\"So much happens in November, and you never know what's going to happen,\" coach Charlie Strong said.\n\nSome things to watch at Nippert Stadium:\n\nBABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE: Temperatures are forecast in the low 30s and upper 20s during the game. The Bulls haven't kicked off a game in temperatures below 40 degrees since a 31-6 loss at Rutgers on Dec. 7, 2013. Fickell doesn't think it will be much of an advantage even though the Bearcats are practicing in the cold.\n\n\"I'll tell you this: It could be 10 degrees, it could be 5 degrees,\" Fickell said, \"but if you've got the momentum and you've got the energy because you're running down the field and scoring or stopping them on defense, I don't care if you're from South Florida or Alaska \u2014 it doesn't bother you nearly as much.\"\n\nBEST D: Cincinnati got its second shutout of the season against Navy, the first time since 1981 that the Bearcats have blanked more than one opponent. They also beat Miami of Ohio 21-0. The Bearcats lead the league in total defense, scoring defense and stopping the run, with a veteran line anchoring a unit that's showing more versatility as it gets deeper in the season.\n\n\"It's encouraging,\" Broughton said. \"You see the puzzle pieces getting put together and having an outcome that's unmatched.\"\n\nRUNNING FOR RECORDS: Michael Warren II has run for at least one touchdown in eight of Cincinnati's nine games. He has 14 touchdown runs, third-most in school history. David Small holds the record with 17 in 1993. Warren has run for 931 yards, putting him in line to become the school's 12th 1,000-yard rusher and its first since George Winn in 2012. Fickell isn't concerned about leaning on him too heavily.\n\n\"Mike's built for this,\" he said. \"Mike's built for November.\"\n\nOUT OF COMEBACKS: The Bulls overcame double-digit deficits three times while winning their first seven games. They've fallen apart in the last two, resulting in their first back-to-back losses in conference play since 2014. They haven't beaten a ranked team on the road since 2011 at Notre Dame.\n\n\"We're 7-0 (entering the Houston game) and we've just been skating by, skating by, skating by,\" Strong said. \"And then how good really are we? There was so much left and so much was there for us to go get, and then we don't go out and compete.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Fred Goodall contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Courtesy of White Coat Waste Project)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The new secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs is rejecting a call for the agency to suspend invasive and ultimately fatal experiments on dogs because he says they could potentially advance medical research and lead to breakthroughs that could help veterans.\n\nSecretary Robert Wilkie said Friday that the VA only has 92 dogs involved in the controversial VA studies, while thousands of dogs are euthanized every day across the country.\n\n\u201cI love canines, I was raised with them,\u201d he said during an appearance at the National Press Club. \u201cBut we have an opportunity to change the lives of men and women who have been terribly hurt, and until somebody tells me that research is not helping that outcome, then I\u2019ll continue.\u201d\n\nThe VA previously told USA TODAY in a statement that his predecessor, David Shulkin had approved the continuation of the experiments, a contention Shulkin denies.\n\nWilkie\u2019s comments are the first he has made publicly on the issue since he was sworn in July 30. He said he is prepared to reauthorize the experiments and signaled he may approve new ones.\n\nAn anti-testing organization, White Coat Waste Project, called last week for a suspension of the controversial experiments until the National Academy of Sciences finishes a study evaluating the need for dogs as research subjects. The VA commissioned the $1.3 study in August. It;\u2019s not due to be finished until 2020.\n\n\u201cI think it calls into question the integrity of the VA\u2019s intentions if it is going to continue funding and conducting dog experiments that it has just paid an organization over a million dollars to scrutinize,\u201d Justin Goodman, a vice president at White Coat Waste, told USA TODAY last week.\n\nMore: VA: Fatal dog experiments moving ahead despite criticism from Congress, veterans groups\n\nThe VA currently has nine studies at four VA facilities that involve surgeries on dogs\u2019 hearts, brains and spinal cords with hopes of advancing medical science to help veterans and others suffering from cardiac problems and spinal cord injuries.\n\n\u201cMy charge is to make life easier for those who have borne the battle,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cThere is nothing more tragic to me (that in) 2018, (at) this stage of development of medicine, that they haven\u2019t been able to find that cure to address spinal cord injuries, paralysis and early deaths from that.\u201d\n\nCritics have said the most recent breakthroughs from the dog testing cited by the VA date to the 1960s, including research that led to the invention of the implantable cardiac pacemaker and procedures that paved the way for the first successful human liver transplant.\n\nCongress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law strict restrictions on the VA dog research in March, mandating that the tests be \u201cdirectly approved\u201d by the VA secretary to receive agency funding.\n\nThe move came after revelations last year that researchers had botched surgeries on dogs at the VA facility in Richmond, Virginia, and amid continued questions among lawmakers and veterans advocates about whether they needed to use dogs at all.\n\nGoodman, from White Coat Waste, blasted the secretary for authorizing continued experiments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that Secretary Wilkie is siding with entrenched bureaucrats who torture dogs for tax dollars over veterans by backing a failed and widely-criticized program that wastes public resources desperately needed for veterans\u2019 care and services,\u201d he said.\n\nMore: VA tightens oversight after outrage over conducting experiments on dogs, then killing them\n\nRobert Wilkie testifies June 27, 2018, at his Senate confirmation hearing in Washington, DC.

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola raised the prospect Friday of soccer authorities punishing the Premier League champions over attempts to circumvent financial fair play rules.\n\nCity is leaving Guardiola to field questions about the leaked internal correspondence published by European media outlets, while executives decline comment. The club has not disputed the authenticity of internal messages showing how it used companies linked to the Abu Dhabi ownership to boost revenue in an attempt to curb losses and comply with UEFA regulations.\n\n\"If there's something wrong we'll be punished,\" Guardiola said at a news conference ahead of Sunday's derby against Manchester United.\n\nCity, which has been owned by Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mansour for a decade, was punished by UEFA in 2014 for breaching the \"Financial Fair Play\" program. The settlement agreement eventually saw the club only forfeit 20 million euros ($23 million) in Champions League prize money. UEFA this week has not said how aware it was of City's schemes, reported by German magazine Der Spiegel, to hide expenses and evade monitoring of spending on players.\n\n\"At the end, UEFA, FIFA, English federation has to say if we were wrong,\" Guardiola said. \"If we were wrong (we) will accept it but I hear what my club said to me and I trust a lot of them.\"\n\nThere was no response to an email sent to three City media officers seeking comment on Guardiola discussing the possibility of the club facing further punishment. City did, however, send an emailed statement announcing a new contract through 2023 for winger Raheem Sterling on Friday.\n\nCity has also not responded to questions from The Associated Press about Guardiola's contract, specifically whether he receives income from entities in Abu Dhabi or other teams owned by Sheikh Mansour. The Football Leaks group published details showing how Roberto Mancini, who managed City from 2009 to 2013 and won the Premier League title in 2012, received more pay from a team Sheikh Mansour owns in Abu Dhabi to work as a consultant than from the Manchester club.\n\nCity has faced a week of damaging headlines about its conduct and financial arrangements since the first leaks were published a week ago.\n\nDer Spiegel showed how the team's holding company \u2014 state-backed Abu Dhabi United Group \u2014 sent cash to a shell vehicle which was created to supposedly buy the right to use players' images in marketing campaigns. This helped turn almost 30 million euros ($34 million) into revenue instead of a cost, for the purpose of UEFA's investigation of club accounts as the club tried to avoid being banned from European competitions for overspending.\n\nWhile City said it \"will not be providing any comment on out of context materials,\" Guardiola was more open to discussing information related to the Football Leaks investigation. Real Madrid was revealed to be working with consultants on a 16-team Super League to kick off in 2021, effectively replacing the Champions League and outside the control of UEFA.\n\n\"I would like to know the ideas,\" said Guardiola, who is in his third season coaching City. \"But, for me, the Premier League, local leagues, are so important, with all the history.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Then she did something more: she helped John get a job. (Photo: Militarykind)\n\nAfter 31 years of dealing with PTSD all alone, veteran John Tipton decided it was time to get help. That help came in the form of a lab-terrier mix named Daisy.\n\nHaving spent 22 years in the Marine Corps and being deployed to places like Lebanon, Grenada, and serving in the first Gulf War, John was no stranger to the trauma of war. He\u2019s one of many veterans who reap the benefits of now having a service dog.\n\nDespite the positive impact Daisy has had on John\u2019s life, he noticed one downside: he was having a hard time finding a job, and he thinks it's because potential employers weren't too keen on him having a service dog. He spent three years searching for a job that would allow Daisy to come work with him, but had no luck. Then he heard from a casino in California that had a unique hiring policy.\n\nRobert Krauss is the Vice President of Public Safety at Pechanga Casino & Resort, and is a Marine Corps veteran himself. \u201cA mutual friend of [mine and John\u2019s] who works here was telling me John couldn\u2019t find a job and was really having a rough time. So I told him to get us in touch with each other and I invited John for coffee,\u201d says Krauss. \u201cThe rest is history. After meeting with John for a few minutes, I knew we had to do something. I had heard and seen the same story too many other times.\u201d\n\nKrauss initiated a six-legged security program at the casino, in which Krauss hires veterans and their service dogs as public safety specialists. John and his shelter-rescue dog Daisy are the inaugural human-canine duo. The casino plans to add 60 legs to the security team, hiring 10 more veterans and their service dogs. Future four-legged candidates will be evaluated by John, who is especially knowledgeable about service dogs because he spends time volunteering with \u201cNext Step Service Dogs,\u201d the very non-profit from which he got Daisy.\n\nAfter years of growing anxiety and depression, now that John has his service dog Daisy and a job, he finally feels like his life is his own again.\n\nSalute to Veterans Series Airs on Veterans Day, offering insightful discussion, resources and solutions for the ongoing issues our military veterans face daily.

(Photo: Richard Russell/YouTube via AP)\n\nA 29-year-old Seattle airport baggage handler intentionally crashed an empty commercial plane following a harrowing 75-minute ride that ended in his death, the FBI concluded Friday.\n\nBefore stealing the Bombardier Q400 in August, Richard Russell had no formal flight training, though the FBI inquiry revealed that the Horizon Air employee had researched flight instruction videos on the Internet.\n\n\"Russell was a properly credentialed employee of Horizon Air, had access to the exterior and interior of the aircraft in the regular course of his duties and did not appear to have violated any security measures or protocols until the theft of the plane,\" the FBI concluded, adding that the Washington man also \"had knowledge regarding the operation of the aircraft's auxiliary power unit and familiarity with tow equipment and maneuvering.\"\n\nAn examination of the flight data recorder, however, revealed that the \"final descent to the ground appears to have been intentional.\"\n\nMore: Family members 'stunned and heartbroken'\n\n\"If the pilot had wanted to avoid impact with the ground, he had time and energy to pull the (steering) column back, raise the nose and initiate a climb,\" the report stated. \"Instead, the column remained in a position forward of neutral and moved further forward about six seconds prior to the end of the (flight recording data).\"\n\nThe final data recording corresponded to the time of the 8:45 p.m., Aug. 10 fatal crash on nearby Ketron Island, Washington, the report found.\n\nThe incident immediately raised questions about gaps in aviation security, years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nAt the same time, authorities determined that the Seattle incident had no link to terrorism.\n\nInstead, Russell appeared to take care not to endanger others when he declined entreaties from air traffic controllers that he attempts a landing at nearby McChord Field. In an exchange captured by the cockpit voice recorder, Russel feared that he might 'mess something up.\"\n\nThroughout the flight, Russell engaged in a running commentary with controllers, some of it veering to dark comedy.\n\n\"You think if I land this successfully, Alaska will give me a job as a pilot? he said at one point, only to later acknowledge that he was \"just a broken guy.\"\n\nIn a separate statement Friday, the federal Transportation Security Administration said an airport security review found no violations related to the incident.\n\nBut the TSA said it was working with the aviation industry to \"look at ways to collectively strengthen security in all aspects of the airport environment.\u201d\n\n.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/09/richard-russell-seattle-baggage-handler-intentionally-crashed-plane/1944186002/", "FILE - In this March 29, 2016, file photo, BYU's Nick Emery (4) stand on the court during the second half of an NCAA basketball game against Valparaiso in the semifinals of the NIT in New York. The men\u2019s basketball program at Brigham Young University must vacate wins over two seasons and received two years of probation from the NCAA after one of its players received extra benefits. The NCAA said Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, that Nick Emery received more than $12,000 in benefits from four boosters, which included travel to concerts and an amusement park along with the use of a new car.(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPROVO, Utah (AP) \u2014 The BYU men's basketball program was placed on probation for two years and must vacate 47 wins under sanctions imposed Friday by the NCAA in an improper-benefits case involving guard Nick Emery.\n\nThe NCAA said the player received more than $12,000 in benefits from four boosters, including travel to concerts and an amusement park and the use of a new car. The NCAA also accepted the university's self-imposed penalties of reducing one scholarship, disassociation of one of its boosters and a $5,000 fine.\n\nBYU said in a statement that the university, the coaching staff and the athletic department had no knowledge of the infractions and that they disagreed with vacating wins. The NCAA didn't identify Emery by name but the university's statement said the case involved him.\n\nThe university also said that it plans to appeal the decision because it considers the vacating of wins to be too harsh and not consistent with recent cases.\n\n\"This sanction includes the most severe vacation-of-record penalty ever imposed in the history of NCAA Division I basketball for infractions that included no institutional knowledge or involvement,\" the statement said. \"In addition, in the case most similar to this situation, appropriate penalties were imposed, but no wins were vacated.\"\n\nCougars coach Dave Rose said in a statement that he was disappointed by the ruling and supported the university's plan to appeal.\n\nEmery withdrew from school last season due to personal problems and the reports of improper benefits. The 6-foot-2 guard returned to the program in April and has been reinstated by the NCAA but is sitting out the first nine games of this season. He served as a captain during the 2016-17 season and was third on the team with 13.1 points per game and second with 75 3-pointers.\n\nEmery said on Twitter on Friday that \"my intentions were never to hurt the program or university.

He also missed 11 games in December with a sprained right ankle.\n\nCurry missed the first round of the playoffs then returned for Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Pelicans as the Warriors went on to win a second straight championship and third title in four years.\n\nQuinn Cook, who filled in last season when Curry was hurt for a long stretch, will start against the Nets. He was promoted from the G League as a two-way player and received a two-year contract ahead of the playoff run.\n\n\"For me to start a lot last year late and play big playoff games ... that did a lot for our confidence,\" Cook said. \"Just staying ready, you've just always got to work \u2014 come in early, stay late.\"\n\nFellow All-Star Draymond Green also will miss Saturday's game, the second straight game that he'll be sidelined by a sprained right foot and toe. Key reserve guard Shaun Livingston missed his sixth straight game and eighth in the last 10 with a sore right foot, but was able to do some scrimmaging Friday. He will have to do that several times before Kerr is ready to put him back on the floor in a game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Tibbets was fired as deputy commander of the Air Force Global Strike Command this fall following allegations of sexually suggestive comments to women, failure to report suicide attempts by airmen and improper use of vehicles. (Photo: Master Sgt. Greg Steele/USAF )\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Air Force cashiered a rising star and grandson of a legendary World War II pilot for sexually suggestive comments he made in public, according to a recently released report.\n\nBrig. Gen. Paul Tibbets IV, namesake of the pilot who dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, was fired as deputy commander of the Air Force Global Strike Command this fall. Tibbets had been scheduled for promotion to major general. Instead the Air Force Inspector General\u2019s findings forced his early retirement, scheduled for Dec. 1, for \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general also found that Tibbets had failed to report suicide attempts by airmen in his command and improperly used vehicles for rides to the airport.\n\nTibbets\u2019 dismissal is the latest in a series of actions taken against senior officers as the military responds to sexual misconduct and the #MeToo movement. Earlier this year, the Marine Corps fired a general for making light of sexual harassment claims by two civilian women. Last month, the Marines forced the retirement of the officer accused of harassment.\n\nTibbets, through Air Force spokesmen, declined to comment for this story. Tibbets has been assigned to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. Like his grandfather, Tibbets is a decorated bomber pilot. Tibbets has flown the B-1 and B-2 stealth bombers. He flew combat missions in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the Balkans.\n\nWhile on the ground, however, investigators found his conduct unbecoming.\n\nTibbets, investigators found, had publicly humiliated an enlisted woman with whom he had regular contact. Investigators found Tibbets and the woman had a \"relationship that was beyond what was customary for a 1-star General and a 1-stripe Airman.\"\n\nThe woman mentioned that Tibbets \"sometimes put his arm around her and state(d) that he loved her.\" She added that she came to resent his attention.\n\nThe woman, whose name is redacted in the report, recalled that Tibbets asked her repeatedly why she had been demoted. She told him in confidence that she had lost rank because of an affair with a married man, a violation of military law.\n\nAt a farewell party for Tibbets at Royal Oaks Golf Course at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, Tibbets, who had been drinking, told others that the woman was \u201csuch a beautiful young lady,\u201d adding, \u201cIf only she didn\u2019t sleep with married men.\u201d\n\nThe woman told investigators she believed that Tibbets had not treated her with dignity and respect.\n\n\"I felt like all the other comments that he had made about me being a good airman and everything were just irrelevant because I felt like that comment that he made was how he truly felt,\" she told investigators.\n\nInvestigators also remarked that the woman was \"calm, confident\" in recalling his comments, while Tibbets appeared \"nervous, more agitated, his complexion became flushed, and he couldn't speak without a water.\"\n\nIn a separate incident, an Air Force captain and technical sergeant told investigators that Tibbets, in uniform and drinking at a Kansas City Chiefs football game on Nov. 6, 2016, had made a coarse reference to a woman's breasts and commented on how \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201chot\u201d she looked. Tibbets and other airmen from Whiteman Air Force Base had attended the game as part of the NFL's \"Salute to Service.\"\n\nOne airman, whose name was redacted, told investigators that Tibbets was joking with others and was \"not a huge football fan, so he doesn't watch the games really and then out of the blue, he basically started talking about (the woman whose name is redacted) and this other lady and how attractive they were.\"\n\nThe airmen felt they had to steer Tibbets clear of trouble. One of them noted that Tibbets had had two or three drinks, Bloody Marys or beer.\n\n\"On a professional level, it made me leery, I guess, in a sense that, 'Okay, if he starts getting, you know, couple drinks in him, what's he going to say?'\"\n\nTibbets recalled having one or two drinks and talking to a woman. He may have said she was attractive, beautiful or hot, Tibbets told investigators. But he did not recall making a vulgar comment about her body, saying those aren't words he uses.\n\nThe inspector general found it likely that Tibbets had used \"inappropriate and unacceptable comments\" about the women and had \"made a comment about breasts.\" The report substantiated that Tibbets had exhibited \"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\"\n\nThe report also found that Tibbets had failed to report to Air Force officials, as required by regulation, four suicide attempts that had occurred by airmen under his command in 2017 at Whiteman Air Force Base. An Air Force official told investigators that Tibbets had pressured an official, whose name is redacted, not to report suicide attempts because in Tibbets' opinion the attempts would not have succeeded.\n\nOne of the cases involved an airman who had been admitted to the hospital multiple times for taking pills and alcohol. Tibbets did not want the airman's attempt on Jan. 17, 2017, to be classified as a suicide attempt, challenging a medical diagnosis, according to the report. It was not reported as a suicide attempt.\n\n\"And we note (airman's name redacted) committed suicide on 26 Jun 2017,\" the inspector general's report found.\n\nIn the end, the investigating officer found Tibbets \"derelict in the performance of his duties when he failed to report attempted suicides of Whiteman AFB personnel.\"\n\nFinally, the inspector general found that Tibbets misused government transportation by taking unauthorized trips to Kansas City International Airport at least 27 times.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/09/air-force-fires-general-sexual-comments-hiding-airmen-suicide-attempts-misuse-vehicle/1936620002/", "DAVIE, Fla.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams canceled practice Friday after a wildfire forced about 20 players and coaches to evacuate their homes.\n\nThe Rams (8-1) will cram their normal Friday preparations into a workout at the University of Southern California on Saturday before they face the Seattle Seahawks at the Coliseum on Sunday.\n\nJust one day after the Rams were stunned by a mass shooting less than five miles from their training complex in Thousand Oaks, they were forced to make big changes in their normal game-week routine by two wildfires burning in Ventura and Los Angeles counties.\n\n\"I don't think anybody's house has been specifically affected, but they did have to leave the areas,\" coach Sean McVay said. \"It's still a scary thing, and extremely unfortunate that they had to go through this. ... We just felt like the most important thing was for people to be with their families.\"\n\nAbout 45 Rams employees were evacuated from neighborhoods south of the Rams' training complex, although McVay doesn't believe any homes have been lost. Those forced to leave their homes Friday included defensive coordinator Wade Phillips and defensive line coach Bill Johnson.\n\nSome of the evacuees moved early into the downtown hotel used by the Rams on the night before games. McVay will hold morning meetings at the hotel Saturday, followed by a practice at USC.\n\nThe Rams already installed most of their game plan for the Seahawks, McVay said. On Saturday, his team will follow a plan that they used in September during their short week of preparation for a Thursday night game against Minnesota.\n\n\"Hopefully things will get under control in the next day, and then we'll get our work done (Saturday) in a little bit of a condensed fashion,\" McVay said. \"But our guys have always been able to adjust and adapt in a good way.\"\n\nThe Rams will hold a moment of silence before Sunday's game in honor of the 12 victims of the massacre at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night.\n\n\"If anything, the last couple of days give you that perspective that we talked about (Thursday),\" McVay said. \"Most importantly is having our players and our organizational people be able to be the leaders of their family as they go through a little bit of adversity. ...

We\u2019ve reached the point where a loss could be so damaging to a team that it won\u2019t be able to recover as if it\u2019s still early in the season.\n\nAlthough the current College Football Playoff picture features Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame with solid grasps on their top-3 spots and Michigan occupying the fourth, nothing is for sure, everything can change and that is why we love this sport.\n\nAs a 16-point favorite, Notre Dame will almost certainly beat a 4-5 Florida State team, and we\u2019re not expecting Rutgers will steal its first Big Ten win of the season against Michigan and its No. 1 defense.\n\nAnd with the way Clemson has manhandled its ACC opponents recently, suffering an upset to Boston College \u2014 even if they\u2019re both top-25 teams \u2014 seems highly unlikely with the Tigers going north as 19.5-point favorites. This battle for the ACC Atlantic division is, however, a prime time game Saturday night (8 p.m. ET, ABC) and where ESPN\u2019s College GameDay show will set up camp.\n\nThose games aren\u2019t quite compelling enough to make our must-see list for the week, but here are four with big playoff implications that we\u2019ll definitely have our eyes on.\n\n1. No. Ohio State (8-1) at No. Michigan State (6-3)\n\nGame time: Noon ET\n\nChannel: Fox\n\nAs ESPN college football analyst Paul Finebaum recently told us, the Buckeyes have the best outside shot at the College Football Playoff. They\u2019re currently No. 10 in the rankings and have just a 16 percent chance to end up among the final four. But if they win out and claim another Big Ten championship, the selection committee will have no choice but to ignore their 29-point loss to Purdue and let them compete for a national championship.\n\nThe problem is Ohio State has been trending down lately with its loss to the Boilermakers sandwiched between wins over Minnesota and Nebraska that were far more difficult than they should have been for a playoff contender. So going on the road against Michigan State won\u2019t be easy \u2014 the Buckeyes are only a 3.5-point favorite \u2014 especially if the Spartans can keep them off the board early.\n\nMichigan State is out of the Big Ten East conversation, but a win would ruin Ohio State\u2019s playoff chances and send Michigan competing for a conference championship (and likely to the playoff).\n\nThe Spartans are banged up, but their No. 1 rushing defense will force the game onto quarterback Dwayne Haskins\u2019 shoulders. And that could mean trouble because the last time that happened, Haskins had 73 passing attempts against Purdue, and we know how that ended. The Buckeyes just haven\u2019t impressed lately, so this one could wind down to the final possession.\n\n2. Auburn (6-3) at No. 5/5 Georgia (8-1)\n\nGame time: 7 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: ESPN\n\nThe Bulldogs are in the SEC championship game with Alabama, and nothing that happens in the final few weeks of the regular season will change that. But if they don\u2019t win out, they\u2019re not going to the playoff, barring any chaos among the other hopefuls. Their best case scenario for the playoff is to win out and upset the Crimson Tide in the conference title game, while the minimum would be win out, lose a close one to Alabama and get help from other teams if the Big Ten and Big 12 implode.\n\nAuburn is having a strange season with a big win last week over Texas A&M but a loss to Tennessee in October. It also lost to LSU earlier in the year, and so did Georgia. The difference is the Tigers lost to the other Tigers by just a point, while the Bulldogs got blown out by 20 points for their only loss so far. It doesn\u2019t seem like Georgia will cruise to victory in this one but maybe sneak away with a one-score game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rivalry game. I mean so many of our kids were recruited by them and so many vice versa. It\u2019s always a rivalry game, and I think that a big part of that is being at your best when your best is needed,\u201d Georgia coach Kirby Smart said, via ESPN. \u201cThe challenge for our guys. We\u2019re playing at home, at night, in our stadium, which I think is really important to our fans, important to our players to protect our home turf, and we want to put our best effort forward.\u201d\n\nGeorgia is a 14-point favorite and has a 40 percent chance of making the playoff still.\n\n3. Mississippi State (6-3) at No. 1/1 Alabama (9-0)\n\nGame time: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: CBS\n\nOK, so given Alabama\u2019s track record so far, we\u2019re probably not going to keep an eye on this one for long. The first half \u2014 maybe even the first quarter \u2014 will tell us whether or not the second half is worth watching. But with a team dominating like Nick Saban\u2019s squad is this year, everyone\u2019s waiting for an actual upset possibility. It\u2019s probably not happening this week, but even a one-loss Alabama team is still making the playoff.\n\n4. Oklahoma State (5-4) at No. 6/6 Oklahoma (8-1)\n\nGame time: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nChannel: ABC\n\nNo. 6 in the playoff rankings, the Sooners still have a 34 percent chance to be among the final four title contenders, but they can\u2019t do it alone. Winning the rest of their games \u2014 including the Big 12 championship game \u2014 is a given prerequisite. But they also need to hope the Big Ten has a two-loss champion (which is still a possibility if either Ohio State or Michigan lose to the winner of the Big Ten West or if Michigan loses one of its next two games but beats Ohio State).\n\nYes, Oklahoma enters as a 21-point favorite, but this Bedlam matchup is still a rivalry game with Oklahoma State looking for its first win since 2014. The Cowboys have been out of the conference championship race for a while, but they could play the spoiler if they score early and often against the Sooners\u2019 just OK defense.\n\nThe problem will be silencing Kyler Murray, Oklahoma\u2019s quarterback who\u2019s still in the Heisman Trophy conversation. He\u2019s leading the nation\u2019s second-best offense and averaging 12.34 yards per attempt with a completion percentage higher than 70 percent \u2014 better than Alabama quarterback and Heisman frontrunner Tua Tagovailoa.", "No. 9 LSU (7-2, 4-2 SEC, No. 7 CFP) at Arkansas (2-7, 0-5), 7:30 p.m. EST (SEC Network)\n\nLine: LSU by 13\u00bd.\n\nSeries record: LSU leads 39-22-2.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\nThe Tigers are out of the Southeastern Conference title race and, even with that lofty CFP ranking, the playoff race.

The Thunder won 95-86.(AP Photo/Tony Dejak) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 This painful season isn't subsiding for the Cavaliers. If anything, it's getting worse.\n\nCleveland, which already has the worst record in the NBA at 1-10, will be without yet another starter on Saturday night in Chicago after forward Cedi Osman was ruled out with back spasms.\n\nHe's the latest Cavs player to join an injury list that includes All-Star forward Kevin Love, point guard George Hill and Sam Dekker, who began the season as a reserve but moved into the starting lineup because of all the injuries.\n\nThrow in a coaching change, some off-court drama and this Cleveland season is sinking fast.\n\nOsman was forced to leave Wednesday's loss to Oklahoma City in the first quarter, and the Cavs were hoping rest would allow him to face the Bulls. However, coach Larry Drew said Osman will sit out against the Bulls \"and we'll see how he is after the game tomorrow.\"\n\nThe rash of injuries has put even greater stress on Drew, who took over after Tyronn Lue was fired following a 0-6 start. Drew asked the team to restructure his contract for the remainder of the season, knowing this rebuilding season would be a challenge.\n\nHe never imagined this challenging.\n\n\"I don't know about snake bit,\" he said when asked about Cleveland's run of bad medical luck. \"Injuries are part of the NBA. When you lose players, other people have to step up. With our situation with K. Love out and then Dekker, now George Hill and Cedi, we're looking at four starters that are out. That's just what it is. But we're not going to hang our heads.\"\n\nDrew's had to adjust his starting lineup and rotation several times already this season, and now he's going to have to do it again.\n\nDrew is running out of options and he's particularly limited up front with three forwards on the shelf. Drew has been resistant to use forwards Larry Nance Jr. and Tristan Thompson together, but may no longer have a choice.\n\nHe got good minutes from center Ante Zizic, who scored 10 points and added nine rebounds while playing a season-high 17 minutes against the Thunder.\n\n\"With two big guys out there, it does give us a little flexibility as far as some of the things we can do on both ends of the floor,\" Drew said. \"Z played well the other night, so I think between the three of those guys, moving forward we could see a combination of either because they do give me flexibility.\"\n\nDrew sees potential in the 6-foot-11 Zizic, who came to Cleveland from Boston in the blockbuster 2017 trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Celtics.\n\n\"He's got great hands,\" Drew said. \"If you throw the ball anywhere around his vicinity, chances are he's going to get it. He does some very, very intriguing things when he's on the floor. I'm going to do everything in my power to get him those playing minutes because when he's in the game, good things happen for us and it's very obvious.\"\n\nWith healthy bodies dwindling, the Cavs signed guard Andrew Harrison to a two-way contract.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Harrison made 64 starts over the past two seasons for Memphis. The Grizzlies waived him after one game this season, and he's found a new home with a Cleveland team that needs him.\n\n\"We really needed to add another ball handler,\" said Drew, adding Harrison will likely play Saturday. \"I'm really excited about him because at that point guard spot he gives us some size. That was one of the intriguing things about him. I remember just playing against him, how he's played well against us. I'm real excited to have him.\"\n\nPer league rules, Harrison can spend only 45 days with the Cavs before they must sign him to an NBA contract.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The American Civil Liberties Union is seeking a court injunction to block President Donald Trump's new restrictions on asylum, arguing in a lawsuit filed Friday that the policy violates federal immigration law.\n\n\u201cThe new asylum ban is flatly unlawful and may result in many people being sent back to danger,\" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project.\n\n\u201cNeither the President nor the Attorney General may override the immigration laws enacted by Congress,\u201d Gelernt said. The ACLU, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Center for Constitutional Rights, filed the lawsuit on behalf of several refugee and immigrant advocacy groups in federal court in Northern California on Friday.\n\nThe Trump administration said the president had acted with \"clear legal authority\" and blasted the lawsuit as defending the rights of immigrants to enter the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"The president has the right to suspend the entry of aliens if he determines it to be in the national interest \u2013 and that is what President Trump has done,\" the Justice and Homeland Security departments said in a joint statement Friday evening.\n\nTrump made the policy official on Friday by signing a proclamation that denies asylum to immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally, rather through a port of entry \u2013 a move aimed at a caravan of Central American migrants moving toward the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn its legal challenge, the ACLU argues that Trump's move flouts a 1965 law that says any foreigner who arrives in the U.S. \u2013 \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival\" \u2013 may apply for asylum. In addition, the suit charges the president with violating a 1946 law that spells out how the Executive Branch can develop and issue regulations.\n\nThat administrative law allows courts to nix any actions that are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" or contrary to constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cEver since the horrors of World War II, the world\u2019s nations have committed to giving asylum seekers the opportunity to seek safe haven,\" said Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. \"The Trump administration cannot defy this most elementary humanitarian principle, in violation of U.S. and international law, with a flip of a presidential pen.\u201d\n\nUnder the new White House policy, immigrants who enter illegally would be placed into expedited deportation proceedings instead of being granted access to the asylum process, according to a posting by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security on the Federal Register late Thursday.\n\n\u2018Flooding our country\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re flooding our country, we\u2019re not letting them in. But they\u2019re trying to flood our country,\" Trump said Friday after signing the proclamation.\n\nAsylum is a form of protection granted to people who fear persecution in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. From 2000 to 2016, the United States granted asylum to an average of 26,651 foreigners a year, according to Department of Homeland Security data.\n\nGelernt said there are already long lines at the legal ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border, forcing desperate migrants into extended limbo as they seek to plead their case for asylum. Most of the migrants have already made arduous journeys to reach the U.S. border.\n\nThe long waits at legal ports of entry have driven some to attempt illegal crossings and request asylum that way. When the last caravan reached the US in April, 401 presented themselves at ports of entry, as the administration has urged them to do, but 122 entered the country illegally to request asylum, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nTrump and other White House officials have claimed there is \"rampant abuse\" in the nation's asylum system, which saw an increase in claims from 5,000 in 2008 to 97,000 in 2018, mostly fueled by Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.\n\n\u201cOur asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it,\u201d Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a joint statement on Thursday previewing Friday's proclamation.\n\nOn Friday, Trump blamed Democrats for blocking reform that he said was needed to fix \"obsolete\" and \"incompetent\" immigration laws.\n\n\"They are the worst laws any country has anywhere in the world, and it's only because we don't have the Democrats' votes,\" he told reporters before leaving for a trip to Paris. \"We need Democrat votes so we can change immigration, and we'll have no trouble whatsoever at the border.\"\n\nTrump restrictions \u2018shortsighted\u2019\n\nRep. Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat who is poised to become chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the next Congress, called Trump\u2019s asylum restrictions \u201cshortsighted.\u201d He said the new Democratic majority will examine Trump\u2019s actions on a broad range of issues, including immigration.\n\n\"The president has the wrong attitude when it comes to immigration or new people coming to this country. He\u2019s afraid of them,\" Engel said. \"I don\u2019t know why. We are a nation of immigrants,\" he added, noting his own grandparents immigrated to the U.S. 110 years ago.\n\nSen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, was more blunt.\n\n\"The president\u2019s xenophobic effort to exploit the suffering of desperate mothers and children legally seeking asylum is clearly intended for crude political distraction from his own failures,\" the New Jersey Democrat said.\n\nTrump's policy would create \"a bottleneck at ports of entry, which will effectively shut the door on vulnerable individuals seeking asylum,\" he added. \"I refuse to stand by as this administration continues to systematically undermine asylum and refugee protection.\"\n\nFriday\u2019s action follows several other steps taken by the administration to halt the caravan. The Pentagon dispatched more than 7,000 active-duty military troops to the border. And U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials have repositioned agents from around the country to line the southern border to prevent illegal entries.\n\nDuring a trip to the border, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said he viewed the oncoming caravan as a \"law enforcement situation\" and his officers could not speed up the process to interview asylum seekers.\n\nOfficials with the departments of Justice and Homeland Security said they are negotiating with Mexico about accepting deported migrants. Mexico has already agreed to grant asylum to immigrants moving north from Central America, largely from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nU.S. officials say that's the preferred location to receive asylum from persecution, but many migrants want to come to the United States.\n\nMore: President Trump denies asylum for immigrants at U.S. border who enter outside ports of entry\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/09/donald-trump-migrant-caravan-aclu-federal-court-immigration-immigration-border-central-americans/1940528002/", "", "CLOSE People who know Cesar Sayoc said they were shocked he's suspected of mailing at least 14 explosive packages through the mail, targeting Democrats.

(Photo: Daniel Pontet, AP)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Pipe bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc has been indicted on charges of using weapons of mass destruction for allegedly mailing 16 improvised explosive devices to prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a 30-count criminal indictment filed Friday in federal court, prosecutors accused Sayoc of threatening to injure his intended targets, violating federal law by sending the devices through the U.S. Postal Service and other charges.\n\nIf found guilty on the most serious charges, he could be sentenced to life in prison.\n\n\"Sayoc's alleged conduct put numerous lives at risk,\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. \"It was also an assault on a nation that values the rule of law, a free press, and tolerance of differences without rancor or resort to violence.\"\n\nThe packages Sayoc is accused of mailing to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former CIA director John Brennan, actor-director Robert De Niro, former national intelligence director James Clapper contained photos of the recipients that were marked \"with a red 'X,'\" prosecutors said.\n\nA similar package sent to the billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros contained a red X over a printout of his name, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictment did not include federal prosecutors' previous allegations that Sayoc mailed similar bomb-laden packages to former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIt was not clear whether the indictment would eventually be superseded by a new filing with additional charges. The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment.\n\nThe federal law definition of a weapon of mass destruction includes destructive devices such as bombs, grenades or rockets that are \"designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury.\"\n\nBefore the indictment, Sayoc had been accused in a criminal complaint that included five federal charges, including illegal mailing of explosives and making threats against former U.S. presidents and others.\n\nNo one was injured. Federal investigators, alerted by postal workers and others, recovered the packages before the devices could explode.\n\nPreliminary FBI analysis found forensic evidence that links Sayoc to 11 of the 16 packages, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office said Friday.\n\nThe indictment calls for Sayoc to forfeit all assets used to conduct or conceal the alleged crimes \u2014 and called for similar forfeiture by \"any entity or organization engaged in planning or perpetrating\" the alleged mail bomb spree.\n\nFederal investigators arrested Sayoc on Oct. 26 in Plantation, Florida, just west of Fort Lauderdale. They said they had linked him to fingerprint and DNA evidence the FBI Crime Lab recovered from some of the packages.\n\nHe has been held without bail since his capture.\n\nSayoc had been scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday for a hearing on the earlier charges. The indictment means that hearing is no longer necessary. A new hearing to arraign Sayoc on the indictment charges has not yet been set.\n\nSayoc's swift identification and capture by federal investigators capped a week of heightened national alarm about potential terrorism as the mysterious explosive-carrying packages were found across the country.\n\nSayoc was estranged from relatives and was living in his van while holding a series of jobs as a food delivery person and disk jockey, investigators said. His white van was covered with pro-Trump and anti-Democrat stickers \u2013 including one showing cross-hairs across an image of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe investigators said a laptop found in the van contained lists of addresses that matched those found on the bomb-carrying packages mailed from South Florida.\n\nCesar Sayoc's van, covered in political stickers supporting Donald Trump and opposing the president's critics.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormer Cleveland Browns offensive lineman Joe Thomas gets ready to head out on a pheasant hunt with veterans during the Heroes Hunt at LEEK Hunting & Mountain Preserve. (Photo: The Brand Amp)\n\nOSWAYO, Pa. \u2014 On a windy afternoon in a remote part of northern Pennsylvania, Joe Thomas and Brett Rogers trudged through a patch of thorny bushes and dense trees, searching for the buck that Thomas had shot with a crossbow a few hours before.\n\nWith a group of people clad in camouflage and neon orange right behind them, the two men followed traces of blood until they found the deer's body in some grass near the creek. They pulled the animal into a nearby clearing and flipped it on its side. Thomas gave Rogers a fist bump.\n\n\"Hell of a morning,\" he said with a smile.\n\nIt's been eight months since Thomas retired from the NFL after 11 seasons \u2014 and 10 Pro Bowl appearances \u2014 with the Cleveland Browns. And it's been about five years since Rogers was medically retired from the Army, returning home from Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries, among other damage.\n\nThey met on an otherwise nondescript Thursday a few weeks before Veterans Day to hunt deer and pheasants at LEEK Hunting & Mountain Preserve, a volunteer-run retreat built specifically for wounded and handicapped veterans. Thomas joined a group of eight veterans from multiple military branches on the hunt. Rogers, 34, was his guide.\n\nFor Thomas, this \"Heroes Hunt\" hosted by off-road vehicle brand Polaris Ranger was an opportunity to merge two of his post-retirement passions: Hunting, and helping the military community.\n\n\"Being able to get all those guys back together in the outdoors, sleeping in bunks \u2014 it kind of gives them that sense of \u2018team\u2019 that they had when they were overseas,\" Thomas said. \"(It's) an opportunity to sort of get out in the woods with each other and share a common experience, talk about the great things about being home, talk about the difficulties of adapting to life after the military and just get an opportunity to relax and let go a little bit.\"\n\nMORE: Jerry Jones, Roger Staubach weigh in on Troy Aikman\u2019s 'dysfunction' comments about Cowboys\n\nMORE: Why Pittsburgh Steelers should leave Le'Veon Bell on bench if he reports\n\nThomas has long been passionate about the veterans community; he regularly set aside season tickets for active-duty military members so they could attend Browns games with their families, and he traveled to the Middle East in 2010 to meet with troops. He's also long been an avid hunter, which is one of the things that drew him to LEEK.\n\nLEEK founder Ed Fisher was quick to admit that the preserve, which sits on more than 100 acres near the Pennsylvania-New York border, is not \"a high-fenced operation.\" He said he and his wife self-funded the organization for the first few years, and it's still run entirely by volunteers, many of whom are veterans.\n\n\"It\u2019s a place where warriors, injured and wounded, can come to heal,\" said Fisher, who himself is a 27-year Army veteran. \"I always tell people that while these men and women are healing in the best hospitals in the world \u2014 and bar none, we have the best. ... But you also have to heal spiritually.\"\n\nBuoyed largely by support within the local community, Fisher said LEEK has been hosting roughly six hunts per season for 11 years now \u2014 reaching approximately 250 wounded veterans along the way. And it's made a lasting impact on participants like Rogers, who was so moved by his hunting experiences that he has since moved his family to the area so he can serve as one of LEEK's guides.\n\n\"When you get back, you don\u2019t really feel like people cared that much about what you did over there and all the sacrifices that you made,\" Rogers said. \"When you come here, you just feel really appreciated for it. The people here make you feel special.\"\n\nOn this particular Thursday, Rogers' role as a guide took him to a hunting blind with Thomas, who arrived at LEEK a little after 5 a.m. The two men share a familiarity with Ohio \u2014 Rogers was born in Columbus and said he has Browns season-ticket holders in his family \u2014 and Thomas said they quickly found themselves \"talking like we've been friends for 20 years.\"\n\nWithin the hour, Thomas had seen his first Pennsylvania buck and shot it in the torso from about 60 yards away. Then it was time for lunch, and an afternoon pheasant hunt. Thomas answered questions from some of the veterans about the Browns' turnaround, what it was like to play on the offensive line and the state of modern quarterback play. It might not seem like much, but for Thomas, it was a small way to say thank you.\n\n\"To me, vets have given the ultimate sacrifice with service, giving everything they have up to, and including, their life to their country,\" Thomas said. \"I think people that have the ability to give back and thank them should, because they deserve it.\"\n\nTo learn more about LEEK Hunting & Mountain Preserve, visit www.leekpreserve.org\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "MURFREESBORO, Tenn.

Kansas State takes on TCU on Saturday. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Kansas already knows that David Beaty will be on the sideline for his final Sunflower Showdown when the perpetually rebuilding Jayhawks visit Kansas State on Saturday.\n\nWhat nobody knows is whether Bill Snyder will also be coaching against Kansas for the final time.\n\nBeaty was fired by athletic director Jeff Long on Sunday after a blowout loss to Iowa State left him 6-39 in three-plus seasons. The search for a replacement is under way even as Beaty continues to lead the Jayhawks (3-6, 1-5 Big 12) through their final three games.\n\nThe 79-year-old Snyder's future has also come into question after the Wildcats (3-6, 1-5) lost a nail-biter to TCU. Snyder insisted this week that he doesn't listen to outside chatter, but those close to the program wonder whether this disappointing season might well be his last.\n\n\"I would imagine people are upset about the fact that we are whatever our record happens to be,\" Snyder said. \"The most significant thing is what takes place in this vicinity, how players are responding. What we as coaches can do and how we can right the ship. How we can get the team back to being as competitive as we can be.\"\n\nThe Wildcats have had bright spots, including a blowout win over Oklahoma State. But they were also routed by Oklahoma and Mississippi State while struggling to beat lower-division South Dakota.\n\n\"All you can do is look forward,\" Kansas State wide receiver Zach Reuter said. \"Focusing on what could have been does nothing.\"\n\nThat is the same approach the Jayhawks are taking.\n\nBeaty acknowledged this week the challenge in keeping his team motivated knowing that he would soon be replaced. But he also insisted that he owed it to his players to stick with them through the end of the season, and that's why he accepted Long's offer to do so.\n\n\"It's going to be one of the funnest games that we get to play in,\" Beaty said. \"I know our guys are really excited about it, and we simply will not allow any distractions to come into our view. Everything that we have and want is still right in front of us, and we expect to get those things accomplished starting with this week.\"\n\nBy that, Beaty means become bowl-eligible. Both teams need to win to keep that faint hope alive.\n\nHOME COOKING\n\nDespite losing records, the Sunflower Showdown remains meaningful to those players on both rosters from Kansas.\n\n\"It's huge,\" said Jayhawks linebacker Joe Dineen Jr. \"You grow up in Lawrence and it's K-State, and you don't like K-State very much. That's just kind of how it goes. I had a few buddies that were K-State fans and on days like Saturday, you weren't friends with them, and stuff like that. It's a real rivalry. It's a lot of fun to play in.\"\n\nTIT-FOR-TAT\n\nKansas safety Mike Lee delivered a jarring shot to Kansas State running back Alex Barnes when the teams met previously, and it's safe to say they haven't made up.\n\n\"We had a little argument (on Twitter), back-and-forth,\" Lee said. \"I know he don't like me and \u2014 I'm not going to say I don't like him. Just the game of football.\"\n\nDUKE'S DISRUPTION\n\nKansas State cornerback Duke Shelley, who had missed the last two games with an injury, is facing internal discipline after he was arrested this week for traffic violations. Shelley had been the Wildcats' best defensive back with 33 tackles and three picks before his injury.\n\nQB CALCUATIONS\n\nBoth teams have shuffled quarterbacks much of the season but both pictures have cleared up. The Jayhawks appear intent on finishing the season behind Peyton Bender, and the Wildcats are relying on Alex Delton after an injury to Skyler Thompson.\n\n\"He's a threat with his feet,\" Jayhawks defensive tackle Daniel Wise said. \"Our goal is to keep him in the pocket.\"\n\nBOOM OR BUST\n\nKansas State's offense has at times looked dominant and disastrous, and offensive lineman Adam Holtorf said that may be his biggest disappointment.\n\n\"When you look at the tape,\" he said, \"that's something that's plagued us all year. Speaking from an O-line standpoint, guys take turns messing up, one here, one there. At the end of the day, those add up and really hurt.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Darnold was injured during the Jets' 13-6 loss at Miami last Sunday, but finished the game. (AP Photo/Dennis Waszak Jr.) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Take a seat, Sam. You're sitting this one out.\n\nNew York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold was listed as doubtful Friday for the team's game against Buffalo on Sunday, making it highly unlikely he will serve as Josh McCown's backup.\n\nWhile coach Todd Bowles left open the possibility Darnold could still dress for the game, the rookie did not practice all week after straining his right foot last Sunday in the Jets' 13-6 loss at Miami. He wore a boot on his foot and watched from the side during practice.\n\nDavis Webb is likely to be signed from the practice squad to the active roster to provide insurance for the 39-year-old McCown, who will make his first start of the season.\n\n\"How he feels, how we think he compares as to having Davis as the backup,\" Bowles said of what will go into the decision on Darnold. \"We'll think about a lot of stuff.\"\n\nThe Jets (3-6) will have a bye-week break after they play the Bills, with their next game on Nov. 25 against New England. That would give Darnold three weeks to heal \u2014 although Bowles said the timing didn't factor in the team sitting him for McCown.\n\n\"He's just not healthy right now,\" Bowles said of Darnold.\n\nBowles said on Thursday that Darnold will move back into the starting role once he's healthy, regardless of how McCown is playing.\n\nMcCown was the starter last season and had a career year before missing the final three games with a broken left hand. He played limited snaps in the preseason, but Bowles isn't concerned about potential rust.\n\n\"He looks like a spring chicken right now,\" the coach said. \"He hasn't played in a while, so he's very camp fresh right now. He should be fine.\"\n\nDarnold leads the NFL with 14 interceptions and his play took a bad turn during New York's three-game losing streak. He has two touchdown passes and seven INTs in that span while working with a supporting cast that has been hit hard by injuries and inconsistency.\n\nMcCown will likely be without one of his key receivers, with Robby Anderson doubtful to play after not practicing all week with an ankle injury.\n\nAnderson has been dealing with it the past few weeks, but played last Sunday against Miami after sitting out against Chicago.\n\n\"It just didn't get any better,\" Bowles said. \"He didn't suffer anything (more). It kind of just didn't get any better.\"\n\nIt appeared wide receiver Quincy Enunwa would also be uncertain to play after missing the first two days of practice, also with an ankle injury. But, he was a full participant Friday and is expected to start.\n\nThis will be the first regular-season game in which Enunwa, who leads the Jets with 25 catches, will play with McCown. Enunwa sat out all last season with a neck injury and was limited this summer while recovering from that before injuring a thumb.\n\n\"I didn't really play in camp because I was hurt, so I didn't really get much (time) with Sam,\" Enunwa said. \"But I still ended up having a good rapport with him to start the season off. So, I'm going to go at it the same way. I'm just going to be where I need to be at, be in the right spot and be where he needs me to be so it's easy for him so we automatically kind of have that connection.\"\n\nThere's a good chance McCown will be taking his snaps from backup center Jonotthan Harrison because Spencer Long was listed as doubtful with knee and finger injuries that held him out of practice all week.\n\nFor several weeks, Long has been dealing with the injury to the middle finger on his right hand, which has affected his shotgun snaps. He had at least six wayward snaps against the Dolphins before being pulled.\n\nHarrison started for Long two weeks ago at Chicago, and Bowles said he's \"very comfortable\" with him at center.\n\n\"We know he's very fast, he's athletic, extremely smart and he does a good job,\" Bowles said. \"He can play multiple positions as well, so it won't be strange having him in there.\"\n\nTight end Neal Sterling will miss his second straight game with a concussion, while nose tackle Steve McLendon is questionable with an ankle injury.\n\nTop cornerback Trumaine Johnson is set to return after missing five games with an injured right quadriceps. He fully practiced on Thursday and Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Penn State needs more out of its offense or the 21st-ranked Nittany Lions might not get much more out of their season.\n\nThe team started the year with Big Ten championship and playoff hopes and had averaged 49 points over a 24-3 stretch. But the Nittany Lions have hit a wall with Wisconsin (6-3, 4-2 Big Ten) up next.\n\nPenn State (6-3, 3-3, No. 20 CFP) will try to erase last week's humiliating loss in Ann Arbor where its offense was held to single digits for the first time since 2014.\n\n\"It's going to be very important that we find a way to establish the run game,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said. \"So there's not so much on the shoulders of Trace McSorley.\"\n\nThe Nittany Lions averaged 252 yards rushing through the first six weeks of the season and had 200-plus on the ground in nine straight games, dating back to last year. They'll take to Beaver Stadium on Saturday looking for a spark after averaging just 120 rushing over the last three games.\n\nRunning back Miles Sanders has remained diligent. He said the backs paid a visit to the offensive line room this week to let the linemen know they have faith in them.\n\nFranklin does, too.\n\nHe's seen them crack open holes for Sanders, whose patient approach can quickly become big plays \u2014 like a 48-yard touchdown sprint through multiple tacklers against Michigan State four weeks ago.\n\nBut those chunk runs have been rare, especially as McSorley, the other cog in the two-headed rushing attack, has dealt with a sore right knee.\n\n\"Miles has shown that he can be a big-play back in this conference and that he can carry the load and get you the tough yards, as well as the big plays,\" Franklin said.\n\nThe Badgers have one of those star backs, too. Jonathan Taylor leads the nation in rushing with 151 yards per game and is a critical facet for the Badgers' slow-burn offensive approach.\n\nRB DEPTH\n\nThe Badgers' running back group goes beyond Taylor.\n\nTaiwan Deal is an effective backup who can spell Taylor for a series, while Garrett Groshek has turned into the primary third-down back with his ability to run, catch passes and block. Fullback Alec Ingold is also a threat in short-yardage situations. He's surprised defenses at times this season with clutch receptions out of the backfield.\n\nONE WIN AWAY\n\nMcSorley is one victory away from tying Penn State's record for wins by a starting quarterback (29).\n\nHe's expected to start despite a right knee injury suffered against Iowa two weeks ago. While McSorley returned to that game and started against the Wolverines last week, he didn't have the same mobility that helped him seize the program's all-time yardage record.\n\n\"He's tough as hell and he's battled through a lot for this team, so we are going to put it all on the line for him,\" Taylor said.\n\nBackup Tommy Stevens entered the game last week and scored Penn State's lone touchdown late. He's expected to play as well.\n\nSTURDY FRONT\n\nFrom the backend of Penn State's defense, safety Garrett Taylor has had a good viewpoint for the development of a handful of defensive linemen.\n\nHe believes Jonathan Taylor will be running into fierce competition all afternoon.\n\n\"They are a talented team up front and he's a very talented back. But you know, I've been saying for a long time, I think we're really talented as a defense. I think you've got to look at guys like Shareef (Miller), Yetur (Gross-Matos), and Kevin (Givens), our front seven are playing really well right now,\" Garrett Taylor said.\n\nMiller, Gross-Matos and Givens have combined for 27 tackles for loss.\n\nDOWN A MAN\n\nWisconsin will play the rest of the season without nose tackle Olive Sagapolu, who was the anchor of the defensive front.\n\nCoach Paul Chryst said the athletic senior had surgery for his right arm injury suffered two weeks ago against Northwestern.\n\nThe Badgers will turn to freshman Bryson Williams to replace Sagapolu, joining a line that already had a freshman and sophomore starting. Sagapolu regularly drew double teams that helped free up standout inside linebackers T.J. Edwards and Ryan Connelly to make plays.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Duffey is expected to get his second start on Saturday against Texas. (AP Photo/Brad Tollefson, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) \u2014 No. 15 Texas has gone from Big 12 leader and College Football Playoff contender to conference chaser after consecutive losses by a combined four points.\n\nTexas Tech has also lost its last two games, and their freshman quarterback took another hard shot last weekend. But the Red Raiders (5-4, 3-3 Big 12) can get bowl eligible with a win Saturday night over the Longhorns, just like they did last year in a regular-season finale last November that most likely saved coach Kliff Kingsbury's job. This game is also the final home game for Tech's seniors.\n\n\"You want them to have that moment, that memory,\" said Kingsbury, the former Tech quarterback in his sixth season as coach. \"Three of those guys have been here every day I've been here. We have a lot of fifth-year seniors that have been through some ups and downs, and going through a lot to get to where they are at.\"\n\nIt is another primetime game in Lubbock, just like last week when Tech lost 51-46 to No. 6 Oklahoma. Freshman quarterback Alan Bowman, one of the nation's top passers, sustained a partially collapsed lung for the second time this season. He was hospitalized for four nights, and dual-treat Jett Duffey is expected to get his second start as Tech looks to get consecutive wins over Texas for the first time in 20 years.\n\nTexas (6-3, 4-2, No. 19 CFP) likely has to win its last three games and get some help to get into the Big 12 championship game. The Longhorns are coming off a 42-41 loss to West Virginia, when Will Grier ran for a 2-point conversion in the final minute. The Mountaineers had more than 500 total yards, like Oklahoma State a week earlier in a 38-35 win.\n\n\"Playing a bit tentative. I think for whatever reason we haven't cut it loose at times,\" coach Tom Herman said of the Texas defense. \"That's on us to figure out why. Maybe it's an uncertainty. Yeah, just playing tentative at times.\"\n\nIt doesn't help that Texas is banged up on defense. Senior defensive end Breckyn Hager (dislocated elbow) was hurt last week but was able to return to practice this week and could play Saturday. Senior cornerback Davante Davis (neck) also could return. Junior safety Brandon Jones (ankle) is questionable to play while Hager's backup, Marquez Bimage is out with a shoulder injury.\n\nHOOK'EM DOWN\n\nPenalizing West Virginia players for taunting for flashing downward \"Hook'em Horns\" hand signals raised new questions over whether the Longhorns get special treatment. Kingsbury this week told his players not to risk it and has issued similar instructions in the past. Texas players call it disrespectful and things could get chippy if a Red Raiders player does it in the heat of the moment. The Red Raiders were penalized for it in Tech's win in Austin last year.\n\n\"It bothers us a lot because we take pride in what we do and that logo,\" Texas wide receiver Lil'Jordan Humphrey said.\n\nRUNNING RED RAIDERS\n\nWhile Texas Tech has one of the nation's top passing games and leads the Big 12 with 376 yards a game, the Red Raiders' 25 rushing touchdowns are second in the league behind Oklahoma's 26.\n\n\"The quarterback and receivers get a lot of the publicity, if you will,\" Herman said. \"You better be able to stop the run or you're going to bleed a slow death. They do it well enough to make you have to defend it.\"\n\nEMERGING EHLINGER\n\nDespite the two-game losing streak, Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger keeps getting better. He had one of his best career games last week with 354 yards passing and three touchdowns and ran for another score. He leads Texas with nine rushing touchdowns. His long TD pass to Devin Duvernay gave Texas the lead with less than 3 minutes left. Ehlinger hasn't thrown an interception in since the first game, but he had a bad one late against Texas Tech last season that set up the Red Raiders' winning touchdown.\n\nHELLO OLD FRIEND\n\nRed Raiders defensive back John Bonney played 37 for Texas the past three seasons before going to Texas Tech as a graduate transfer in August.\n\n\"John's a graduate of the University of Texas and gave us four years of his blood, sweat and tears and we're very thankful for that,\" Herman said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Jim Vertuno contributed to this report from Austin, Texas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray has followed in Baker Mayfield's footsteps in more ways than one.\n\nSure, Mayfield won the Heisman Trophy last season, and Murray is one of the top contenders this season. But Mayfield also played mind games with the best of them, and it appears Murray was a willing apprentice.\n\nAmong other things, Mayfield wore a handlebar mustache the week of games against Oklahoma State, declaring a new sheriff was in town. With Oklahoma State visiting the sixth-ranked Sooners on Saturday, Murray stirred the pot like his predecessor. In his media availability this week, he started off by seemingly downplaying the Bedlam rivalry game.\n\n\"I'm just ready to play another game, honestly,\" Murray said. \"Another great opportunity for us as a team against a good team. Obviously, there's a rivalry. Obviously, it will be intense on Saturday. But for us, we still have to execute and play well.\"\n\nThen, he started delivering jabs.\n\nOklahoma State (5-4, 2-4 Big 12) leads the nation with 3.67 sacks per game, and defensive end Jordan Brailford leads the Big 12 with nine. Oklahoma (8-1, 5-1, No. 6 CFP) rarely allows Murray to get touched. When asked about Oklahoma State's pass rush, Murray said, \"I don't really have a comment on them right now.\"\n\nHe was asked if he had relationships with Oklahoma State's players, he replied, \"Not really. I mean, I was recruited by Oklahoma State. Other than that, I don't really know them.\"\n\nWhen asked who recruited him, he claimed he couldn't remember Oklahoma State offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich's name, then mispronounced it. When asked if he liked Yurcich, Murray simply said, \"I'm not a fan of Stillwater,\" the location of Oklahoma State's campus.\n\nOklahoma State has a chance to become bowl eligible with a win and provide a highlight for an up-and-down season that includes wins over Texas and Boise State and an ugly loss to Kansas State.\n\n\"It's a special weekend for everybody,\" Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. \"It always has been. Everybody wears orange or red this week. It's a big game. I think that works to our benefit. I know they (Oklahoma State's players) will be riled up, too. They will be excited to play in this game.\"\n\nOklahoma needs a win to stay within reach of a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Sooners also are trying to keep their place atop the Big 12 standings with West Virginia.\n\nSECOND HALF SOONERS\n\nOklahoma has been strong defensively in the second half of games since Ruffin McNeill took over as interim defensive coordinator after the loss to Texas. The Sooners gave up 24 points in the first half against TCU, but three in the second half. They allowed just seven in each half against Kansas State, then allowed 31 in the first half against Texas Tech, but just 15 in the second half of a 51-46 win .\n\nANOTHER SHOOTOUT?\n\nOklahoma defeated Oklahoma State 62-52 last year in the highest-scoring game in Bedlam history. Mayfield passed for a school-record 598 yards and tossed five touchdown passes. Oklahoma's Marquise Brown broke out with a school-record 265 yards receiving. A similar shootout could ensue this year \u2014 Oklahoma ranks second nationally in total offense, while Oklahoma State is 10th.\n\nDELIVERING JUSTICE\n\nOklahoma State's running back has 3,504 yards rushing in his career, seventh in school history. The junior needs 277 yards to move past Ernest Anderson for sixth place, and 294 yards to move past Barry Sanders for fifth. He ran for 228 yards in last year's game against Oklahoma.\n\nSERMONATOR\n\nOklahoma running back Trey Sermon ran for career highs of 26 carries, 206 yards and three touchdowns against Texas Tech last week. He leads the team with 722 yards rushing and eight touchdowns.\n\nWALK-ON STARS\n\nOklahoma receiver Lee Morris and Oklahoma State quarterback Taylor Cornelius are semifinalists for the Burlsworth Trophy, given to the nation's best player who started his career as a walk-on. Morris has eight touchdown receptions. Cornelius has passed for 2,622 yards and 20 touchdowns.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 The big question facing Utah when it hosts Oregon is whether Jason Shelley can pick up where Tyler Huntley left off.\n\nShelley, a redshirt freshman, will make his first career start Saturday against the Ducks in place of Huntley, who broke his collarbone in the third quarter of Utah's 38-20 loss last week to Arizona State.\n\nShelley struggled after being thrown into action against the Sun Devils. He threw for 59 yards and an interception on 4-of-11 passing. With a full week of taking reps as a starter in practice, and having the game plan adjusted to fit his individual strengths, Utah's coaches are confident Shelley can produce better results against the Ducks.\n\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham said Shelley is similar to Huntley in his running and passing skill set. Whittingham said the freshman also brings a fearless attitude that will help the offense adjust to Shelley quicker.\n\n\"One thing is he's very calm under pressure,\" Whittingham said. \"Not that Tyler is not, but his demeanor is very even-keeled. He doesn't panic and doesn't press.\"\n\nThe Utes will need Shelley to adjust to his new role quickly after losing Zack Moss to a knee injury. Moss suffered the injury at practice Wednesday and now will require season-ending surgery.\n\nIt's a big blow to the Utah offense. Moss ranks third in the Pac-12 in rushing yardage with 1,092 yards. His 6.1 yards per carry are second-best among running backs in the league.\n\nOregon expected Moss to be the top concern for its defense Saturday. Even with the Utes missing a pair of key playmakers, the Ducks don't count on it making things go any smoother with Utah.\n\n\"With Utah, which is a great football program, it starts and ends with their physicality on both sides of the ball,\" Oregon coach Mario Cristobal said. \"Up front, by the truck load, they have big powerful guys that set the tone for the game. That's always been part of their identity.\"\n\nThe Ducks will give Utah's defense plenty of things to worry about as well.\n\nJustin Herbert is one of the league's better passers. He has thrown for 2,333 yards and 22 touchdowns while completing 59 percent of his passes. The junior lit up the Utes two years ago in a 30-28 win for Oregon in Salt Lake City, throwing for 324 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHerbert's top target, Dillon Mitchell, leads the Pac-12 with 833 yards and six touchdowns on 56 catches. Mitchell has tallied at least 500 yards more than any other Oregon receiver this season and has a league-best 735 receiving yards on 50 catches in Pac-12 play.\n\n\"We'd like to spread it around more, but Dillon just does a great job of getting open,\" Herbert said. \"He runs great routes and is able to identify the coverage and adjust and do things that get him open.\"\n\nOther things to note ahead of this week's game between Oregon and Utah:\n\nCOVEY'S IMPACT: Oregon needs no introduction to how Britain Covey can impact a game. Covey played a huge role in lifting Utah to a 62-20 road victory over the Ducks in 2015. He had a pair of touchdown receptions and also famously faked out Oregon to set up a punt return touchdown.\n\nCovey leads Utah this season with 555 yards on 50 receptions. He has tallied 85 yards on 10 carries and has thrown for 71 yards and two touchdowns on 3-of-3 passing.\n\nDAVEY O'BRIEN SEMIFINALIST: Herbert was named one of 16 semifinalists for the Davey O'Brien Award. He and Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew are the only semifinalists from the Pac-12. Herbert made his 24th career start in Oregon's 42-21 win over UCLA and became the fastest Ducks player to reach 6,000 career passing yards in terms of starts.\n\nPROVIDING A SPARK: Ugochukwu Amadi's versatility is invaluable to Oregon on defense and special teams. Amadi is the only FBS player to score touchdowns off a punt return and an interception return this season. He has returned two interceptions for touchdowns and is tied for second in the Pac-12 with three interceptions. Amadi is also tied for the FBS lead with two punt returns over 50 yards. The senior has gained 20 or more yards on four of eight punt returns.\n\nRED ZONE LOCKDOWN: Scoring in the red zone has been hit or miss for the Ducks at times this season. Their conversion rate (31-of-38) ranks ninth in the Pac-12. It could play in Utah's favor. The Utes lead the nation in red zone defense. They have allowed 15 scores on 27 attempts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Even taking a one-shot penalty for an unplayable lie was not an easy option. If his drop settled between rocks, he would have to play that or take another penalty.\n\nFinally, he found a spot and the drop landed in enough soft soil for him to pitch out of trouble, through the fairway and into the rough. He got his fourth shot onto the green and made the long putt to escape with bogey.\n\n\"That was great,\" Kuchar said. \"I knew I had a par 5 following it, and I figured I was probably going to make double there and birdie on the next. I ended up making bogey there and par on the par-5 13th, so still felt like I was very much in control.\"\n\nWhat put Kuchar in good shape were the five straight birdies on the front nine, and then he took the lead for the first time with a birdie on No. 11 before his wild adventure on the 12th hole. Tied again for the lead, he added two birdies coming in for his two-shot cushion.\n\nChamp already is the talk of the tour for the speed of his swing and how far he hits the ball, though there is more to his game than length. El Camaleon Golf Club is all about location \u2014 preferably the fairway \u2014 more than smashing it as far as possible.\n\nTwo weeks after winning the Sanderson Farms Championship in Mississippi, he worked on a few tweaks in his swing and was in full control of where the ball was going. For the second straight day, Champ missed only two fairways, key to good scoring at Mayakoba.\n\n\"It's not a bomber's course,\" Champ said. \"You have to place it off the tee, and some holes the rough is very thick and you've just got to whack it out. This course I feel like is very suitable for everyone. Just to be able to place my ball right in the fairways and on the greens and make the putts when I needed is great.\"\n\nAn area renowned for its wild weather \u2014 rain out of nowhere, plenty of wind \u2014 has seen sunshine and calms for two days, and it's reflected in the scoring.\n\nThe cut was at 4-under 138. The weekend will not include Jordan Spieth.\n\nThe three-time major champion missed the cut in his final event of the year after a 69. Spieth managed only eight birdies in good scoring conditions and will have the weekend off for the seventh time this year. Next up is his wedding over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nKuchar, meanwhile, has more than Champ to worry about the next two rounds.\n\nThe seven players at 11-under 131 included defending champion Patton Kizzire, past Mayakoba champion Brian Gay and Anirban Lahiri of India, who has played in the last two Presidents Cups. Eighteen players were within five shots of the lead.\n\nRickie Fowler (68) and Tony Finau (65) were at 8-under 134, along with their Ryder Cup captain, Jim Furyk, who had a 65.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Sam Mustipher gets to run out of the home tunnel one final time for No. 3 Notre Dame on Saturday night against Florida State.\n\nThe graduate center just never thought he'd be snapping the ball to senior Brandon Wimbush again.\n\nWith Ian Book nursing an injury, Wimbush is expected to be the starting quarterback when the Fighting Irish (9-0, No. 3 CFP) face the Seminoles (4-5).\n\nCoach Brian Kelly indicated Wimbush has been getting the majority of Mustipher's snaps this week with the No. 1 offense and that freshman Phil Jurkovec has increased his work load after Book suffered an upper-body injury while accounting for 399 total yards and a victory-securing touchdown run in Notre Dame's 31-21 win last week at Northwestern.\n\nThe Irish believe they can continue their quest for their first national championship in 30 years with Wimbush running things \u2014 and he is likely to run if he can. Mustipher reminisced this week about Wimbush's breakout performance \u2014 207 rushing yards and four touchdowns in a 49-20 victory last season at Boston College.\n\n\"(Wimbush) took over that game,\" Mustipher said. \"He made some moves I've never seen a quarterback make in a game. He's a great player and a great young man. He'll be successful in whatever he decides to do in life.\"\n\nThe Irish, of course, just want Wimbush to be successful against a Seminoles defense that has been stingy against the run.\n\nOpponents are averaging just 2.84 yards per carry (sixth-best nationally) and 111.1 yards per game (17th) against end Brian Burns (13.5 tackles for loss) and behemoth tackles Demarcus Christmas (6-4, 305), Fredrick Jones (6-2, 304), Marvin Wilson (6-5, 317) and Cory Durden (6-5, 290). The Seminoles have piled up 25 sacks.\n\n\"I don't think their offense is going to change much,\" Florida State coach Willie Taggart said. \"They have a capable backup quarterback that's played a lot for them and won some games for them, too.\"\n\nFlorida State has been vulnerable through the air, allowing 282.6 yards per game and Wimbush averaged just 196.3 yards per game while throwing for one score in the three victories before he was replaced by Book, who averaged 301.8 yards and had 15 TD passes in the six victories.\n\n\"Brandon has handled it better than anybody else I know could have being put in that position,\" said senior wide receiver Miles Boykin, who leads the Irish with 40 receptions for 624 yards and seven touchdowns. \"I haven't seen him hang his head once.\"\n\nTALE OF TWO QBs\n\nTaggart has a little quarterback dilemma of his own: whether to start junior Deondre Francois, who has completed nearly 61 percent of his passes for 2,039 yards and 13 touchdowns before leaving the 59-10 Clemson loss with a concussion, or sophomore James Blackman, who replaced Francois and threw for 421 yards and four touchdowns in Florida State's 47-28 loss at North Carolina State.\n\n\"We'll see on Saturday,\" Taggart said.\n\nFrancois, who has been receiving most of the snaps with the No. 1 unit during the open portions of the team's morning practices this week, believes it will be him.\n\n\"I'm still the No. 1 guy \u2014 coach Taggart continues to make that clear,\" Francois said. \"James understands that, but James is always ready to go if anything happens to me.\"\n\nBABY, IT'S (GOING TO BE) COLD OUTSIDE\n\nThe Seminoles, who have been practicing in summer-like conditions, may see snow upon their arrival in South Bend, where the wind chill for Saturday night's kickoff is expected to be 23 degrees.\n\n\"I've been through tougher times than this,\" said the 6-foot-5, 181-pound Blackman, who has been through hurricanes in his native Florida. \"Ah, man, it's football. I ain't going to let the weather get to us.\"\n\n\"I've played in some pretty cold games,\" said middle linebacker Dontavious Jackson, who played high school ball near Houston. \"Never played in the snow \u2014 I'm looking forward to it. People think we're not because we're Southern boys, but I'm actually looking forward to it.\n\nGAME OF THE CENTURY\n\nFlorida State holds a 6-2 edge (and has won the last three) in the series that has seen six games decided by seven points or less. Perhaps the best of the bunch came on Nov. 13, 1993, when Lou Holtz's second-ranked Irish were a touchdown underdog at home against Bobby Bowden's top-ranked Seminoles. In that \"Game of the Century,\" the Irish took a 31-17 lead late into the fourth quarter before eventual Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward mounted a late comeback. The quarterback connected with Kez McCorvey on a fourth-and-20 play for a touchdown with 1:39 remaining.\n\nAfter the Irish went three-and-out, Ward got his team to the 14 with three seconds remaining. But Shawn Wooden, playing with a torn knee ligament, knocked down Ward's pass in the end zone to preserve Notre Dame's 31-24 victory. The No. 1 Irish lost 41-39 to Boston College the following week, clearing the way for the Seminoles to earn their first national title with an 18-16 victory over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.\n\n___\n\nBob Ferrante, a freelance reporter for the AP Tallahassee bureau, contributed to this preview.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nLong lines of cars on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. (Photo: Chris Woodyard)\n\nMALIBU, Calif. \u2013 As the morning began, the surf beckoned and the skies were a brilliant blue, signaling another idyllic day, but within hours one of California\u2019s most fabled playgrounds Friday would be under threat of a massive wildfire.\n\nRaging wildfires roared Friday across California, killing at least five people and sending 157,000 people from their homes. In tony Malibu, cars snarled Pacific Coast Highway as residents faced a mandatory evacuation order covering the famous beachside enclave. Some lined up five deep at a gas station for a chance to get fuel. All were being directed south toward the safety of Santa Monica as the sky above turned an inky black.\n\nAt the Point Dume Village shopping Center north of the famed Malibu pier, business was brisk Friday morning at a coffee bar, the Cafe De La Plage. Customers wore T-shirts, shorts and sandals. Many of them were evacuees, having fled their nearby homes the night before in the belief Malibu would be a safe haven.\n\n\u201cI am just very unhappy,\u201c said James Collins, 48, from the small community of Cornell. He said he had been evacuated at 4 a.m., but he was taking it in stride, noting the rest of the nation has had its share of natural disasters recently.\n\n\u201cOther people have rain. We have fire,\u201c said Collins.\n\nGlynn Palmer, 55, and his son Truman, 15, were also trying to make the best of the evacuation. Unable to return to their home in Oak Park, they were plotting on how to make good use of the scuba equipment they had in their car to turn the day into something a little less scary.\n\nA pair of Dutch bicyclists in a trek from Vancouver, British Columbia, to San Diego were trying to stay ahead of the flames. They had gotten on the road before the highway closures and were peddling as smoke billowing in the hills nearby.\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid,\u201d said one of them, Twan Goense, 24, of Delft, the Netherlands.\n\nMore: Fires across California have forced 157,000 people from their homes; at least 6 dead\n\nRelated: 'Destroyed': In Paradise, California, entire community of 27,000 was ordered to evacuate\n\nAlso: After the fire comes the bill: The rising cost of fighting California blazes\n\nOne man was also taking it all in stride. Victor Adams, nursed a drink with his yellow Labrador Dale at his side.\n\n\u201cI just hope for the best,\u201d Adamo said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through it before.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Anthony said she was glad she evacuated when she did, at 7:20 a.m., from her home on Point Dume in Malibu. She was still driving 2 \u00bd hours later on Pacific Coast Highway, inching along in gridlock traffic with her two dogs and a car full of keepsakes.\n\n\u201cI feel good that I\u2019m away from this huge plume of smoke,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nA few neighbors told her they were staying. She evacuated on her own, with her family out of town.\n\n\u201cWhen the firefighters say go, I go,\u201d she said.\n\nHer husband, Pete Anthony, said it was hard to be away from home.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s stressed out as hell. But she has the dogs,\u201d Anthony said of his wife, adding that he has fire insurance. \u201cWe\u2019re covered.\u201d\n\nThe drive from Malibu either north or south meant nearly standstill traffic and some evacuees were caught by surprise as they tried to get gas to leave the area. The power abruptly went out at an Arco gas station near Point Dume where there had been lines of people filling up their tanks. Fearful of running out of gas, they were exchanging information on where they might find the closest open station.\n\n\n\nSome gawkers stopped in their luxury cars at closed shopping centers to shoot photos of flames that appeared to be as high as 20 feet as they marched down the hillsides. All the while, winds were gusting up to 50 miles an hour at the top of the hills. Farther north, the sky was black with smoke.\n\nSusan Cain Tellem, who runs American Tortoise Rescue, wrote on her Facebook page: \"Time to leave,\" with a photo of a plume of smoke looming over Malibu.\n\nTellem and her husband have rescued or re-homed 4,000 turtles and tortoises since 1990. Many of the animals live on their Malibu property, including goats, chickens, turtles and tortoises.\n\nBy phone at Zuma Beach in Malibu, Tellem said she loaded up as many of her animals as she could with her husband Marhsall Thompson, but had to leave several of the larger tortoises behind.\n\n\"I don't know if we are safe or not. Our home is right above where I am standing and it doesn't look happy,\" Tellem said before the cell phone signal dropped.\n\nA wildfire in Malibu was heading straight for a local beach Friday afternoon. (Photo: Chris Woodyard)\n\nBy 3 p.m., the fire was burning along Pacific Coast Highway, only a 100 yards or so from Malibu\u2019s sprawling surf. At one point south of Encinal Canyon, power poles were burning, threatening to topple and drop their wires across the highway.\n\nThe fire was within a quarter-mile of opulent homes on the highway\u2019s inland side and was poised to consume the beachside villas on the other side.

The flames were encroaching on the club and houses across the street, including Ventura County fire station 56.

(AP) \u2014 Austin Cindric and Ross Chastain have landed the full-time rides in the Xfinity Series, and both will be driving the best cars of their careers.\n\nChastain was named driver of the No. 42 Chevrolet at Chip Ganassi Racing on Friday. DC Solar will sponsor Chastain, an eighth-generation watermelon farmer from Florida who got his big break when the CEO of the company noticed how hard the driver was working to chase his dreams.\n\nCindric will drive the No. 22 Ford next season for Team Penske. MoneyLion will expand its Penske relationship as Cindric's primary sponsor for 18 Xfinity races. MoneyLion also signed on to sponsor two Cup races for Joey Logano, one for Ryan Blaney and has pledged to give its members 5 percent cash back on certain NASCAR purchases.\n\nBoth Chastain and Cindric will both start next season as championship contenders for the Xfinity Series, the stepping stone to NASCAR's big leagues.\n\nFor Chastain, it's a remarkable breakthrough. DC Solar CEO Jeff Carpoff said he noticed Chastain working on a bus in the motorhome lot at the track, asked about it and learned Chastain was doing various side hustles to fund his racing.\n\n\"I thought, man, this kid really wants to drive and that inspired me. I started following closely the performance that Ross was doing on the track,\" Carpoff said. \"Here at Phoenix earlier this year, I saw Ross in the driver meeting and I told him I was going to try to do something for him. I didn't know what, but I wanted to do something.\"\n\nCarpoff, already a sponsor at Ganassi, pushed the team owner to take a look at the 25-year-old, even though Chastain had nothing remarkable on his resume.\n\n\"I could not have picked Ross out of a lineup of tall women and him,\" Ganassi said. \"I repeatedly told Jeff to get the hell out of here, leave the drivers to me.\"\n\nCarpoff persisted and Chastain got a shot in the Ganassi Xfinity car at Darlington, where he won the pole, led 90 laps and wrecked with Kevin Harvick while racing late in the race for the lead. Two weeks later, back in the Ganassi car at Las Vegas, Chastain scored his first career NASCAR national victory.\n\nNow he'll have a chance to race for a title next season.\n\n\"I am just trying not to throw up,\" Chastain said about his new opportunity.\n\nCindric moves to Team Penske, where his father is president of the organization. The 20-year-old has split his time this season between both of the Team Penske Xfinity entries, and a car from Roush Fenway Racing. That will end next year as Cindric gets a consistent ride.\n\n\"I feel like everything I've been able to learn and put together has been leading up to this,\" Cindric said. \"It's a huge opportunity. Without MoneyLion this wouldn't be possible. As a young driver these are the opportunities you live for, you work for and you hope come around.\"\n\nCindric is currently eighth in the Xfinity standings and needs to win Saturday at ISM Raceway near Phoenix. Cindric has one career win in the Truck Series and he made the championship four in that series last season.\n\nTeam Penske will continue to run the No. 12 Xfinity car on a limited basis in 2019 with Brad Keselowski, Logano, Blaney and Paul Menard as drivers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Buffaloes are hoping for a big boost with the possible return of star sophomore Laviksa Shenault Jr. when they host 10th-ranked Washington State on Saturday. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOULDER, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Star sophomore Laviska Shenault Jr . indicated on Instagram that he'd be back on the field Saturday when slumping Colorado hosts No. 10 Washington State.\n\nHis return would provide a big boost for the banged-up Buffaloes (5-4, 2-4), who were once the last remaining unbeaten team in the Pac-12 but now face the possibility of missing out on a bowl berth that was in their grasp two weeks ago before they blew a 28-point second-half lead to lowly Oregon State.\n\n\"The return of 2Live ..\" Shenault posted Sunday night.\n\nBuffaloes coach Mike MacIntyre was more cautious, saying Shenault \"did a little bit\" in his return to practice Monday but labeling him \"still day to day.\"\n\n\"Hopefully we'll get him back sometime before the year is over,\" MacIntyre said.\n\nThe Buffs were 5-0 when Shenault got hurt at USC, and Colorado lost that game and the next three without the superstar receiver who had six TD receptions and five TD runs before getting injured.\n\nShenault was a Heisman hopeful as he piled up 780 yards on 60 receptions and 87 yards on 15 rushes, and his return took on more urgency when Buffaloes receivers Jay MacIntyre (concussion) and K.D. Nixon (hip) got hurt last week at Arizona.\n\nSo, Shenault's social media post was an encouraging sign as the Buffs prepared for the Cougars (8-1, 5-1, No. 8 CFP) who are the Pac-12's last remaining hope for a College Football Playoff berth.\n\nCoach MacIntyre doesn't want to make excuses, but acknowledges Shenault's injury was a backbreaker.\n\n\"I think when you take a Heisman Trophy candidate out of the picture, it's a big deal,\" MacIntyre said. \"If you had taken Rashaan Salaam off the '94 team, I don't know they might still have been really good, they had a lot of great players. But you take a Heisman Trophy candidate out at the time he left, he was leading the country in every category kind of like (Washington State QB Gardner Minshew).\n\n\"If you take Minshew out, it might change Washington State. We haven't had our best football player on the field since halfway through the USC game, so he only played five and a half games.\"\n\nOther subplots in the 12th meeting between the Cougars and Buffaloes:\n\nCLOSE CALLS: The Buffs' losses during their skid have come by a total of 40 points and include two one-score heartbreakers.\n\n\"All four losses were close games,\" Colorado linebacker Rick Gamboa said. \"It's not like we've gotten blown out or anything. In all games, we had a chance to win. Just little things and corrections we need to make. We are preaching that in practice.\"\n\nMAGIC MINSHEW: Minshew is the nation's leading passer with 3,517 yards, 27 TDs and seven interceptions.\n\n\"He makes all the right throws,\" MacIntyre said. \"He's from Brandon, Mississippi, I know right where he's from. I used to recruit in that area when I was at Ole Miss. That's a football area right there, right outside of Jackson. He has mobility, he's making throws.\"\n\nCOUGARS O-LINE: MacIntyre said the unsung heroes of the Cougars' Air-Raid offense is the O-line.\n\n\"Nobody hardly gets near him very much. They do an excellent job. The offensive line is big and athletic, they've done a good job with those guys,\" MacIntyre said. \"I've been very impressed with their offensive line, that's helping it flow like they want it to.\"\n\nPOINTS OF PRIDE: A week after winning a shootout against Stanford, Washington State bogged down and needed a late touchdown catch by Easop Winston Jr. to edge Cal 19-13 last week. They converted just 4 of 12 third downs and scored just two TDS in five red zone trips.\n\n\"I'm proud of my team,\" Cougars coach Mike Leach said. \"Those are very tough opponents.

Bears players were the first team to collectively commit to donating more than $250,000 to social justice initiatives.\n\nThe players formed a social justice committee consisting of Acho, tight end Trey Burton, defensive lineman Akiem Hicks, quarterbacks Chase Daniel and Mitchell Trubisky, and four front office staff members. But more than 40 players have been involved and provided donations.\n\nEXPECTING TWINS\n\nSaints veteran tight end Ben Watson was resting easy this week knowing he wouldn't be fined $10,000 for celebrating a touchdown against the Rams last Sunday by telling the world he and his wife, Kristen, are expecting twins.\n\nWhen Watson scored, he stuffed the football under the front of his jersey, and then at first held up five fingers on one hand as he often does to honor his five children, after which held up two more fingers on his other hand in honor of the twins on the way.\n\nWatson, 37, said he similarly stuffed the ball under his jersey after scoring in 2009, when Kristen was close to full term with their first child, Grace. Soon after, he was fined for using the ball as a prop.\n\n\"So the cool thing is I will be able to say (to his twins) that, 'When I did it for Grace, I had to pay. When I did it for you all, the league had changed,'\" Watson said. \"What a difference nine years make.\"\n\nBut only so much of a difference. That same game, Watson's second-quarter celebration was upstaged by receiver Mike Thomas pulling a cell phone out of the goal post padding after his fourth-quarter score. He used a flip phone like that used in a similar celebration by former Saints receiver Joe Horn. Thomas was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\n\"Where did he get a flip phone?\" Watson said. \"I said (to Thomas), 'Do you even know who Joe Horn is? You must have been in elementary school back then.' But that was pretty good. I've got to give him props on that one.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Watson said it looked like his celebration inadvertently caused his wife, a Baton Rouge native, to miss much of the game.\n\n\"I'm looking up at her and she's just got her head down the whole time because people were just blasting her with text messages and she was trying to respond,\" Watson said.\n\nWatson, who is active on social media, said he also was surprised by the volume of responses from fans.\n\n\"We didn't expect so many people to, I guess, notice,\" Watson said. \"It was pretty public. It was. But I'm thinking, I'm looking at her. It's a shout-out to her. ... I guess it just means that people love babies, man. People love babies.\"\n\nTOUCHDOWN TODD\n\nRams running back Todd Gurley, last year's Offensive Player of the Year, leads the NFL with 16 touchdowns. the fourth-year pro has scored at least one touchdown in each of the Rams' nine games this season.\n\nWith a touchdown against Seattle on Sunday, Gurley would join Pro Football Hall of Famers O.J. Simpson (1975), Lenny Moore (1964) and Elroy \"Crazy Legs\" Hirsch (1951) as the only players to score a touchdown in each of their team's first 10 games of a season.\n\nSimpson and Moore had at least one touchdown in each of their team's 14 games during their respective record seasons.\n\nFLIPPING PERFECT\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid has sent his captains to midfield before kickoff nine times this season, and nine times they have trotted back to the sideline having won the coin toss.\n\nThe absurd streak, which trails the Lions' NFL record of 14 straight coin-flip wins during the 2004-05 season, has become a running sidebar in the Chiefs' locker room. Nobody talks about it, much like a pitcher in the midst of a no-hitter, lest the streak come to a crashing end.\n\n\"I don't want that pressure on me, for sure,\" quarterback Patrick Mahomes says. \"I joke about it, it's one of the most nervous parts of the game for me. Everyone knows the coin-toss thing is going.\"\n\nThe Chiefs have called heads in each of their first four away games and won, and their opponents called tails in their first two home games and lost. The Chiefs also won the flip the last three weeks against the Bengals, Broncos and Browns and elected to defer each time.\n\n\"It's ridiculous,\" Reid said, \"but on the other hand, if one goes the other way you have to be ready to go. You can't have a letdown or something with the coin toss.\n\n\"We get a kick out of the thing going on,\" Reid added, \"but you have to be ready to roll.\"\n\nDAD'S LEGACY\n\nSix-year veteran Kenny Stills will play at Lambeau Field for the first time Sunday when the Miami Dolphins visit Green Bay, but his family has a history there.\n\nStills' father, Ken, played for the Packers in 1985-89.\n\n\"If you go on YouTube, there's a video of him kind of cheap-shoting somebody after the play \u2014 the Bears-Packers rivalry,\" Kenny Stills said.\n\nThe video from Lambeau shows flags flying when Stills hit blocker Matt Suhey after the whistle. The elder Stills will be at the game Sunday with divided loyalties.\n\n\"There are no hard feelings there,\" the younger Stills said. \"I definitely think he's rooting for the Dolphins. Maybe he'll have a split jersey \u2014 half Dolphins, half Packers.\"\n\nTHE NEXT FRIDGE\n\nThe Eagles could use 6-foot-8, 346-pound offensive tackle Jordan Mailata at running back.\n\nMailata is more athletic than William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry, who had three rushing TDs for the 1985 Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears, including one in the title game. Mailata was an Australian rugby player before the Eagles selected him in the seventh round in April.\n\n\"He's definitely used to carrying a larger football. I don't know what they call it, that ball (in rugby),\" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \"Very athletic guy. It's intriguing. I mean, it's not out of the question.\"\n\n___\n\nPro Football Writers Barry Wilner and Rob Maaddi, and Sports Writers Dave Skretta and Joe Kay contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jay Westcott/The News & Advance via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nVirginia is stepping out conference play this weekend when the Cavaliers host Liberty.\n\nIt's a scheduling oddity for Virginia, which is in contention for the ACC's Coastal Division title and the Cavaliers say they will not look past the Flames on Saturday.\n\n\"Just the next-week mentality,\" linebacker and tri-captain Chris Peace said of digesting a loss to Pittsburgh and moving forward. \"After the NC State loss, I was just like, 'OK, it happened. You're never going to get it back. Just focus on the next week. That's all you can do.' And I pointed out, we're not too ahead from last year. We're 6-3, just like we were last year at one point. Now, however, we want to finish.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers (6-3) and Liberty (4-4) have never met on the football field, but Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said his team has plenty to work on both sides of the ball with the Flames bringing an explosive offense to Scott Stadium.\n\n\"What stands out is production,\" he said. \"Liberty is ninth nationally in throwing the football, I think 26th in scoring offense, and so the statistics jump out. Not hard to see on film that they have some talented players, a nice scheme design and are very clear about what their identity is and the speed in which they want to do it.\"\n\nVirginia, meanwhile, got away from what it wants to do in a 23-13 loss to Pittsburgh. The Panthers contained Bryce Perkins and sacked him five times, which highlighted the need to be less reliant on the quarterback.\n\n\"Our run game can't just be Bryce on zone read pull and then quarterback scramble,\" Mendenhall said of Perkins, the team's No. 2 rusher. \"That can't be the majority of the yards. That can be complementary, but it has to come off of run game execution off our core plays. Right now it's shifting in reverse order.\"\n\nGetting it fixed against the Flames should be less difficult. While they are scoring 36.9 points per game, they also are allowing 38.2 points per game, and opponents have run for an average of 238 yards against them.\n\nLiberty coach Turner Gill expects Perkins and Co. to offer a significant challenge.\n\n\"He starts it off,\" Gill said of Perkins. \"Very, very talented dual threat guy. ... He makes a lot of things happen with his legs as he's making throws and also, he can just take off running. He breaks a lot of tackles.\"\n\nLast week, they allowed 777 yards in a 62-59 triple-overtime loss to Massachusetts.\n\nHere are some other things to watch when Liberty visits Virginia:\n\nTRIPLE OPTIONS\n\nPerkins' running ability is supposed to open things up for tailback Jordan Ellis, wide receiver Olamide Zaccheaus and others, but none of that happened against Pitt. Ellis carried just 10 times (for 46 yards) and the fleet-footed Zaccheaus, the school's career receptions leader, touched the ball only five times all game.\n\nFOCUS\n\nMendenhall said this week that the rare late non-conference game can present a challenge, and Virginia has seemingly overcome the focus issues that have affected recent teams. Doing it again against the Flames, and preparing to close the season on the road at Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech, will show further growth.\n\nRECORD WATCH\n\nJunior quarterback Stephen Calvert has 62 career touchdown passes, three shy of breaking Robby Justino's career record at the school. He's also one of just three FBS juniors with over 7,000 passing yards and 60 TD throws and has 46 completions for 20 yards or more this season, including 20 to Antonio Gandy-Golden (51 catches, 9 TDs).\n\nSACK EXCHANGE\n\nBoth programs have defensive players who specialize in getting to the quarterback. Virginia linebacker Chris Peace has six sacks this season, and Liberty DE Jessie Lemonier has nine, including six in the last two games.\n\nSEND 'EM OUT RIGHT\n\nMendenhall hopes the surge in fan support Virginia has seen this season continues.\n\n\"I would love to have a great outing at home to finish this season,\" he said. \"Very appreciative of our fans, and a noticeably different feeling in Scott Stadium this year to me in terms of the energy, the support, the student section. There is a noticeable difference. For me to notice it on the sideline is pretty significant.\"\n\nVirginia will honor 27 fourth-, fifth- and sixth year players in Senior Day ceremonies prior to the game.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It also reduces pain and increases milk production, they believe.\n\nOne of the most common ways mothers consume placenta is to have it dried and made into pills. It can be eaten raw, dehydrated into a jerky-like food, cooked, roasted and made into smoothies or elixirs.\n\nSome health advocates warn it could be dangerous\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said mothers should be especially careful of the practice after an Oregon mother unwittingly gave her newborn a Group B Streptococcus, a serious infection which called for hospitalization, after eating her dehydrated placenta. The mom was clear of the bacteria, so it took days for doctors to test and realize it was inside the placenta capsules she was eating.\n\nResearch published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology said benefits of placentophagy (the medical way to say eating placenta) is likely a result of the placebo effect.\n\n\u201cWe found that there is no scientific evidence of any clinical benefit of placentophagy among humans, and no placental nutrients and hormones are retained in sufficient amounts after placenta encapsulation to be potentially helpful to the mother postpartum,\u201d authors of the report said.\n\nLike All the Moms?

(Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt\u2019s Week 10 of the fantasy football season. If you are looking for an unexpected roster replacement or an inexpensive starter for your daily fantasy lineup, here are players who could help.\n\nThese deep sleepers are players flying under the radar whose matchups suggest they could have a big game in Week 10. Just remember, they are risky fantasy plays given the other options likely available.\n\nQB Andy Dalton, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nDalton is ranked in the lower tier of quarterbacks, despite a favorable matchup against the New Orleans Saints, who allow 325 yards and more than two passing touchdowns per game. While the Bengals will try to establish the run with star receiver A.J. Green out, inevitably Dalton will throw the football. He has the potential for a top-10 finish.\n\nFantasy rankings: How players stack up at each position in Week 10\n\nRB Austin Ekeler, San Diego Chargers\n\nAfter a hot start to the season with 410 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns, Ekeler has disappointed with 162 yards and zero touchdowns in the last three games -- even with starter Melvin Gordon missing one game.\n\nThings will change this week against an Oakland Raiders run defense that's consistently been one of the worst in the league. There will be plenty of work for Ekeler -- including in the red zone, where the Raiders allow the most touches to running backs. Ekeler should eclipse 80 all-purpose yards and post a score.\n\nRB Kapri Bibbs, Washington Redskins\n\nThe Redskins should game-plan a run-heavy offense this week against a Tampa Bay Buccaneers team that can run up the score. The Bucs lead the league in touchdowns allowed to running backs. Adrian Peterson will need an occasional breather and Bibbs will benefit to the tune of 50 to 70 all-purpose yards and a touchdown.\n\nWR Danny Amendola, Miami Dolphins\n\nDanny Amendola has been the most consistent player on the Dolphins over the past four games, especially in PPR leagues, where he\u2019s totaled 24 receptions for 233 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe Dolphins play a Green Bay Packers pass defense that has sustained its fair share of injuries in recent weeks. In the past three games, they've allowed an average of over 200 yards and one touchdown to wide receivers. Look for Amendola to post his first 100-yard receiving game and get back into the end zone.\n\nTE Mike Gesicki, Miami Dolphins\n\nBig things were expected from the second-round draft pick, but he hasn\u2019t been incorporated into the Dolphins offense as expected. This week, Gesicki should have his best game of the season against a Packers defense that does not defend tight ends well.\n\nIn the past two games, the Packers have allowed 424 yards, three touchdowns, and the most red zone targets to tight ends. Gesicki should post 60 to 80 yards and his first touchdown of the season.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers defense/special teams\n\nA fringe defense this week for many prognosticators, the 49ers have been one of the best over their past two games, totaling 11 sacks and 21 points allowed, and limiting opponents to an average of 281 yards of total offense per game.\n\nThe 49ers play a New York Giants team allowing the second most sacks (seven in their last game) and averaging under 20 points per game. The 49ers defense is primed for a top-10 finish in a game that could turn into a defensive battle.\n\nJim Saranteas, aka \"The Fantasy Greek,\" is a contributing writer for Ourlads.com, part of the USA TODAY Network.", "CLOSE Tens of thousands of people fled a fast-moving wildfire Thursday in Northern California, as they abandoned vehicles ahead of the flames that forced the evacuation of an entire town and destroyed hundreds of structures.

(Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun)\n\nThree separate wildfires are ravaging communities and forests across California, with hundreds of thousands forced to evacuate their homes.\n\nThe Camp, Hill and Woolsey fires are expected to continue burning for days. The flames from the Camp Fire in Butte County, California, were spreading at 80 acres per minute Thursday, which is equivalent to burning an entire football field every second, according to UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain.\n\nHow have the flames spread so quickly in California? USA TODAY breaks it down:\n\nThe Santa Ana Winds\n\nA high pressure system moving over the Great Basin, a watershed that covers parts of Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and California, is creating \"Santa Ana winds,\" according to the National Weather Service. The pressure moves winds over California and toward the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\"When you have an easterly flow, especially associated with Santa Anas like we've seen in the last day or so, you get a desert air mass that gets shoved westward towards the coast,\" Accuweather Meteorologist Brett Rossio said.\n\nWinds have reached 50 mph in some parts of the state, according to fire officials. This makes it difficult to contain the perimeter of the fire as it spreads in multiple directions, Accuweather reported. The wind gusts are also making it difficult to contain the fire from above with planes or air tankers, Fire Capt. Stan Ziegler told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nWinds are expected to diminish Saturday as the pressure system weakens, but they will return Sunday as another front moves toward California, according to the NWS.\n\nA 'fuel bed'\n\nDry conditions are contributing to the spread of the flames as well, according to Butte County CalFire Chief Darren Read.\n\n\"Basically, we haven\u2019t had rain since last May or before that,\" Read said in a news conference Thursday. \"Everything is a very receptive fuel bed. It\u2019s a rapid rate of spread.\"\n\nRossio said dry climates can be a catalyst for wildfires. \"If you don't have any rainfall to moisten up the soil, moisten up the vegetation, then it creates a more susceptible pattern for fires to occur,\" Rossio said.\n\nBut Rossio said the rain California saw prior to May is also contributing to the fires.\n\n\"Over the last few years we actually have had a lot of rain across California, but what that does is create a lot more vegetation for fires.\" Rossio said. \"It's a cycle.\"\n\nMore: Evacuation ordered for much of Malibu as raging fires drive 157,000 from their homes\n\nMore: 'Destroyed': In Paradise, California, entire community of 27,000 was ordered to evacuate\n\nMore: After the fire comes the bill: The rising cost of fighting California blazes\n\nDrying phenomenon\n\nThe fires are also spreading due to low humidity and high temperatures across California, spurring on flames.\n\n\"When you raise your temperature, you're also lowering your relative humidity,\" Rossio said. \"That's why this is happening. It's a drying phenomenon.\"\n\nBut the Santa Ana winds are making the low humidity even lower, according to Rossio.\n\n\"When you have very low humidity from the desert moving over an area that has vegetation, you're drying the air mass,\" Rossio said. \"You're drying the vegetation out. So any vegetation there becomes kindle for fires to develop.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/09/california-wildfires-why-have-flames-spread-so-quickly/1941342002/", "Bayern's Joshua Kimmich, left, Bayern's Jerome Boateng, background right, and Freiburg's Lucas Hoeler challenge for the ball during the German Bundesliga soccer match between FC Bayern Munich and SC Freiburg in Munich, Germany, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018.

(AP Photo/Eugene Tanner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOGAN, Utah (AP) \u2014 Slowing down the blistering pace of Utah State's offense has become a virtually impossible task for nearly every opponent that's faced the Aggies this season.\n\nThe No. 14 Aggies enter their regular-season home finale against San Jose State on Saturday entrenched among the nation's best teams at finding the end zone.\n\nUtah State (8-1, 5-0 Mountain West) ranks second nationally in scoring offense (50.1 points per game), trailing only Alabama, and 14th in total offense (4,371 yards). The Aggies also have a knack for piling up points and yards fast. They rank second among FBS teams with 19 scoring drives under a minute.\n\n\"What we do on offense is very hard to replicate during the week in practice for scout teams,\" Utah State coach Matt Wells said. \"It's extremely hard at the pace that we're playing.\"\n\nSophomore quarterback Jordan Love ranks among the top 30 nationally in passing efficiency (156.4), completion percentage (.651), and passing touchdowns (19). He has thrown for 2,185 yards in nine games.\n\nUtah State is averaging 6.68 yards per play \u2014 which ranks 14th nationally. Twenty different players have scored a touchdown this season for the Aggies.\n\n\"You don't ever sit around and imagine scoring this many points,\" Wells said. \"We're in a good rhythm, our guys are very confident in what we're doing and again, it goes back to our philosophy. It's what we do and how we do it.\"\n\nUtah State will have a chance to rewrite some school records against the Spartans.\n\nThe Aggies have scored 58 touchdowns this season and need three more to surpass the school record of 60 set in 2011. With 451 points, they also need only four more points to top the school record of 454 points scored in 2012.\n\nStrong first quarter starts have helped Utah State fill up the stat sheet. The Aggies have led at the end of the first quarter in all nine games this season and have outscored opponents 138-32 in the first 15 minutes.\n\n\"They're outstanding on defense,\" San Jose State coach Brent Brennan said. \"Their quarterback is playing at a really high level. They're very good in the kicking game. It really is the most complete team that we've played this year.\"\n\nThe Spartans (1-8, 1-4 Mountain West) could be in for a long afternoon trying to keep up with Utah State.\n\nSan Jose State ranks among the bottom 20 FBS teams in scoring defense (36.1 points per game) and total defense (462.1 yards per game). The Spartans have had equal trouble generating offense, averaging just 22.9 points and 324.1 yards per contest to rank near the bottom of the Mountain West in both categories.\n\nOther things to note going into this week's game between San Jose State and Utah State:\n\nLOVE EXPECTED BACK: Utah State suffered a scare when Love did not play the final two series of the first half or the entire second half of last week's 56-17 win over Hawaii after he took a knee to the helmet. Wells said he has no concerns about Love's health and expects that he'll be ready to go Saturday. Love led the Aggies to touchdowns on their first four drives and finished with 127 yards and a touchdown on 10-of-13 passing.\n\nTHE 100 CLUB: Three different San Jose State receivers have a shot at reaching 100 career receptions on Saturday. Justin Holmes enters the game with 99 receptions, Tre Huntley has 95 and Josh Oliver has 91. All three players are seniors. Oliver is the team's leading receiver this season with 580 yards on 49 catches.\n\nSNAGGING TAKEAWAYS: A tough defense is making Utah State's offense feel even more formidable by creating good field position. The Aggies have forced 23 turnovers (14 interceptions, 9 fumbles) in nine games. They lead the Mountain West and rank second nationally behind Georgia Southern in the category. Utah State is also second nationally with four defensive touchdowns.\n\nGETTING KICKS: San Jose State kicker Bryce Crawford is the only FBS player to rank in the top 30 nationally in field goals made per game and punting average. The senior has made seven straight field goals and averages 1.4 makes per game. He is averaging 43.96 yards per punt.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

No player in the NFL hit both of those marks over the entire 2017 season.\n\n\"With Earl Thomas out for the year, it's easy to see Smith as the top safety in the league.\"\n\nThe AP voters overwhelmingly agreed. Smith received 97 points in a 10-points-to-one-point system, garnering eight of 10 first-place votes. He finished second on one ballot and third on the other to easily outdistance the New York Giants' Landon Collins, who had 69 points.\n\n\"Not only is Smith the clear leader at this position, particularly with his skills in coverage,\" said New York-based writer Barry Wilner, \"but he's probably Minnesota's most valuable defensive player.\"\n\nThat's saying a lot, particularly with a team that includes defensive end Danielle Hunter, who leads the NFL with 11\u00bd sacks.\n\n\"Smith is an elite pass defender who can bat away a throw or pick off a pass on one play, then sack the QB on the next,\" Washington-based Howard Fendrich said.\n\nSmith finished second in last year's voting, with Thomas winning. The injured Seahawks star, who's out for the season with a broken left leg, had 59 points \u2014 and received one first-place vote, from Bay Area-based Josh Dubow \u2014 to finish third this year.\n\n\"Thomas is still the benchmark at safety despite a season-ending injury,\" Dubow said.\n\nThere were 28 players who received at least one vote, but Smith and Collins were the only safeties to appear on all 10 ballots.\n\nCollins jumped up two spots after finishing fourth last year. He doesn't have any interceptions yet this season, but has firmly established himself as one of the best at his position.\n\n\"Yeah, he's on a team with one win (entering Week 10), but Collins is strong tackler and pass defender,\" New York-based Simmi Buttar said.\n\nTennessee's Kevin Byard is fourth with 54 points, but received the other first-place vote from Nashville-based Teresa M. Walker.\n\n\"Byard is just getting better with every game,\" Walker said, \"and he was pretty good in 2017 when he was an All-Pro who tied for the league lead with eight interceptions and led the NFL with 10 takeaways.\"\n\nByard has two interceptions this season, and caused quite a stir with his star turn on his most recent pick.

Upstairs is the headquarters for app Whisper.com, and next door (see the sliver?) is the former home of actress Angelica Huston. Jefferson Graham", "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 George Aston has seen a lot in five years at Pittsburgh. Two coaching staffs. A handful of big-time upsets that hinted at a turnaround. Just as many baffling losses that have ultimately prevented it from happening.\n\nStill, the burly fullback hasn't seen this: it's November and the Panthers are in first place in the ACC's Coastal Division heading into a visit from Virginia Tech. Pitt's first trip to a conference title game is within reach, an achievement that Aston and the rest of the 19 seniors who will play their final game at Heinz Field on Saturday know would leave a tangible lasting legacy.\n\n\"We haven't been in this position this late in the season before,\" Aston said. \"It's pretty late in the season, we control our own destiny. We've just got to win.\"\n\nSomething the Panthers (5-4, 4-1) have managed to do with regularity over the last month, reviving what threatened to be a lost season. Pitt has won three of four \u2014 the lone setback a narrow 19-14 nonconference loss to unbeaten Notre Dame on the road \u2014 to move into the driver's seat in the typically unwieldy Coastal, which could have its sixth different champion in as many years.\n\n\"I felt like we put our mind to it, this team can do a lot of different things,\" defensive end DeWayne Hendrix said. \"Just us going through adversity as a team, losing games that we weren't supposed to and now we're finally starting to get into a groove. We always knew we should be winning those games. We just didn't know when it was going to happen.\"\n\nThis might be the year. Emphasis on might. The Panthers, however, are wary. As promising as the last month has been, it can come undone very quickly. A team built on running the ball and defense understands it has little margin for error. Still, they like their chances.\n\n\"A lot of people doubted us,\" Hendrix said. \"People are going to doubt you when you're losing but when you're winning, they're going to jump on the bandwagon. We know how good we can be but we can't be sidetracked on that. We've got to go out and grind each week just like everybody else.\"\n\nSomething Virginia Tech (4-4, 3-2) has been unable to do during a stretch in which it has dropped three of four. Still, the Hokies can revive their own chances at capturing the Coastal \u2014 and salvaging an uneven year \u2014 by beating the Panthers for the third straight time.\n\n\"It's not our job to be frustrated, it's our job to try to fix, coach and mentor,\" Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente said. \"Continuing to try to push these guys forward so that they can execute on a more consistent basis so that as a team we have a chance to have more consistent play against very good people.\"\n\nVIVID MEMORY\n\nVirginia Tech edged Pitt 20-14 in Blacksburg last season thanks to a dramatic goal-line stand in which the Hokies stopped Pitt on four shots from inside the Virginia Tech 5 in the final minute. The loss ultimately cost the Panthers a shot at a bowl game and the near miss has come up frequently over the last 12 months.\n\n\"We all know what happened,\" Pitt sophomore quarterback Kenny Pickett said. \"We remember it clearly. It's extra motivation this week.\"\n\nROAD WARRIORS\n\nThe Hokies have been a bit of an erratic mess this season thanks in large part to an inability to get things done at Lane Stadium. Virginia Tech is just 1-3 at home \u2014 including 0-2 in the league \u2014 but has been solid on the road. The Hokies have won four straight ACC road games dating to a victory at Virginia in the 2017 season finale. Quarterback Ryan Willis has been a little more productive away from Lane Stadium. His road quarterback rating of 147.3 is a tick above what he puts up at home (134.9).\n\nTRYING THIS AGAIN\n\nIn Boston College last week, the Hokies played the team whose style most resembles the very physical approach Pittsburgh takes offensively and allowed 219 yards rushing. That came a week after they allowed 465 to Georgia Tech. With perhaps his youngest defense ever, Hokies defensive coordinator Bud Foster hopes having played the Eagles will help. \"Yeah, they're going to be similar,\" he said. \"Big and physical up front. Big, physical, athletic tailbacks. They're going to be very similar in a lot of ways. Maybe it will benefit us a little bit, but we'll see.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Hank Kurz in Richmond, Virginia contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Murray, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe New York Knicks want you to believe this front-office and coaching regime are better and different than the previous one, just like they wanted you to believe the previous one was better different from the one before that.\n\nWhat makes this front office, led by president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry, and this coach, David Fizdale, the right group and why should you believe them given the \u201cfool me once\u201d cynicism that accompanies the franchise?\n\nTo convince the faithful (and perhaps skeptical) Knicks fan and the neutral (and perhaps skeptical) observer, it will take more than a season or two of prudent front-office decisions and on-court progress.\n\nBut there are signs the Knicks are at the very least intent on sticking to a plan, starting with a shared vision between the front office and Fizdale.\n\nThere is a patient approach to building a team that can improve and possibly compete at the highest level of the Eastern Conference. They are not rushing after the next shiny object. They want Fizdale to establish a culture of hard work, player development and accountability.\n\nThink about what Utah and Philadelphia have done over the past five seasons. Or what Brooklyn is trying to do or Atlanta, which is a few years behind Brooklyn in the process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to not missing any steps,\u201d Mills said at the start of the season. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take this as a step by step process. We\u2019re focused on the guys that we have on our roster. How can we build them? How can we develop them? We\u2019re just going to continue on with our plan.\u201d\n\nThat plan was tested during training camp when Minnesota\u2019s Jimmy Butler requested a trade. The old Knicks might have gone all in on Butler, offering first-round picks for an All-NBA performer. The new Knicks didn't.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a building mode. We need to draft players. We need to build through the draft. We need to develop our young players,\u201d Mills said. \u201cWe feel comfortable organizationally where we\u2019re going and what we\u2019re developing here and when it\u2019s time for us to go after free agents, we\u2019ll be a place to attract free agents and we shouldn\u2019t use our draft picks like that to go out and attract guys.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to following a plan and not just shifting and pivoting because we see something that we think is attractive and fast track something. I\u2019ve seen that happen and go wrong too many times, and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nPerry backed that. \u201cWe really believe in this philosophy and the direction we\u2019re taking this organization and we\u2019re excited about it. \u2026 We check each other to make sure we stay on course.\u201d\n\nNow, can the front office and coach stick to that course over time?\n\nThe Knicks wanted to get more athletic, and they did in the draft with Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson and by signing undrafted rookie Allonzo Trier. They also are willing to take chances on lottery picks who were castoffs \u2013 Noah Vonleh and Mario Hezonja. Vonleh is in his fifth NBA season but just 23 years old and has three double-doubles this season. Perry, from his days in Detroit, is keen on players who blossom late.\n\nThey want to keep All-Star Kristaps Porzingis, who is recovering from a torn ACL, long term, but they held off on an extension because it will help preserve cap space next summer when the Knicks will room to sign a max player. The Kevin Durant-to-the-Knicks talk will persist, and there are league executives in the Eastern Conference who believe the Knicks are the front-runner if Durant leaves Golden State in free agency.\n\nFizdale is focused on player development and is embracing Knicks history by bringing former players to talk with the team \u2013 Bernard King, Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier and Bill Bradley among them so far.\n\nThe Knicks are 4-8 and probably won\u2019t win more than 30 games. But that\u2019s not the point, at least this season. They want to play hard, be competitive and learn what it takes to win games.\n\n\u201cWe talk in NBA circles all the time, and we feel good that the view of the Knicks is different than it was before amongst players,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThere\u2019s a different vibe about how we\u2019re trying to do things. We know it\u2019s moving in the right direction.\u201d", "FILE - In this Sept. 23, 2017, file photo, Duke coach David Cutcliffe, left, and North Carolina coach Larry Fedora speak prior to an NCAA college football game in Chapel Hill, N.C. Fedora's Tar Heels have lost 19 of 24 games dating to November 2016 entering Saturday's trip to Duke. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Duke has already secured bowl eligibility. Now coach David Cutcliffe wants a strong finish to the regular season.\n\nThe Blue Devils host rival North Carolina in Durham on Saturday knowing they're headed to a postseason game. But they haven't won two straight games since September, either.\n\n\"We can't afford to be up and down,\" Cutcliffe said. \"We've got to finish this thing out. November needs to be special for us.\"\n\nDuke (6-3, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) can match its win total for last season, which ended with a win against Northern Illinois in the Quick Lane Bowl. Beating the Tar Heels would also ensure the program's fifth winning season in six years, the first time the program's done that since the 1960s.\n\nAnd they're playing to keep the Victory Bell presented to the winner of the annual instate rivalry. Duke has won the past two meetings and four of the past six since Larry Fedora took over at UNC.\n\nThe Blue Devils are coming off a road win against Miami, and still have a cross-divisional game at No. 2 Clemson next week followed by the regular-season finale at home against Wake Forest on Nov. 24.\n\n\"You don't get hoggish,\" Cutcliffe said. \"I do know how to count to six (wins for bowl eligibility). That's important. But at the same time, this team should be focused on what lies ahead potentially. . I know that our seniors and upperclassmen in general expect more from this team and themselves.\"\n\nThings have been much tougher for the Tar Heels (1-7, 1-5), who have lost several close games and are headed for a second straight bowl-less finish. UNC is in the midst of a two-year slide that has seen the Tar Heels lose 19 of 24 games since November 2016, a stretch that began with a loss at Duke.\n\n\"It's definitely not easy,\" UNC quarterback Nathan Elliott said of staying positive. \"But these guys in this locker room and these coaches have done a great job of keeping everyone focused and moving forward.\"\n\nHere are some other things to know about Saturday's UNC-Duke game:\n\nCLOSE LOSSES\n\nThe close losses have piled up for the Tar Heels, including a mistake-filled home game to Virginia Tech and a double-overtime loss at No. 13 Syracuse. Fedora has said his team is \"extremely close\" to coming up with the play or two needed to win a game.\n\n\"It's making sure they know that every play could be the difference in the game,\" Fedora said. \"That's the way you have to play the game.\"\n\nNO OVERLOOKING\n\nDuke receiver Johnathan Lloyd said the Blue Devils won't expect an easy game despite UNC's record. Besides, there's a recent reminder from two years ago when the Tar Heels arrived with a No. 15 national ranking to face a Duke team that hadn't won an ACC game \u2014 and lost.\n\n\"They're better than 1-7,\" Lloyd said. \"You turn on the tape, they're not a bad football team. They've had some breaks go against them. . We have to come out and play, and if we don't, we can get beat.\"\n\nRED-ZONE STOPS\n\nDuke leads the ACC in red-zone defense, allowing opponents to score on 17 of 24 trips inside the 20-yard line (nearly 71 percent). Thirteen of those scores have been touchdowns, with only two through the air.\n\nTURNOVER PROBLEMS\n\nWhen asked recently what was the biggest factor in UNC's two-year slide, Fedora pointed to turnovers and failing to take care of the football.\n\nThe Tar Heels rank near the bottom of the Bowl Subdivision ranks in turnover margin at minus-1 per game, which is 13th in the 14-team ACC. Last weekend's loss to Georgia Tech offered an example of how much it has hindered the Tar Heels; they rallied from 18 down in the third quarter to tie the game, only to have Elliott throw two fourth-quarter interceptions as the Yellow Jackets went on to win.\n\nThey can't keep repeating those same mistakes if they want to win another ACC game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Miami will start redshirt freshman Perry over senior Malik Rosier for the second time this season, when Miami plays Georgia Tech on Saturday night. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Tech players have not forgotten a last-second loss at Miami last season.\n\n\"I think it was kind of the turning point of our season last year,\" said Yellow Jackets quarterback TaQuon Marshall.\n\nThe Hurricanes' 25-24 win last year helped Miami win the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coastal Division while Georgia Tech fell short of a bowl bid for the second time in three years.\n\nSaturday night's game could be similarly important for each team.\n\nGeorgia Tech (5-4, 3-3 ACC) will try to extend its two-game winning streak when it faces struggling Miami (5-4, 2-3), which has lost three straight. The Yellow Jackets, who have enjoyed a sharp increase in forced turnovers , have won four of five following a 1-3 start.\n\nOne year ago, Darrell Langham's 28-yard catch on a tipped ball on fourth down set up Michael Badgley's 24-yard field goal with 4 seconds left for the Hurricanes.\n\nIt's a bitter memory for the Yellow Jackets.\n\n\"We've been waiting on this one,\" said quarterback Tobias Oliver. \"It's one we had marked on our calendars. We've definitely been looking forward to it.\"\n\nEach team has been alternating quarterbacks. Miami coach Mark Richt announced Thursday he will start redshirt freshman N'Kosi Perry over senior Malik Rosier for the second time this season.\n\n\"I think both Malik and N'Kosi practiced well,\" Richt said. \"I think both competed well. We're just making the decision based on what we think gives us the best shot.\"\n\nMarshall, a senior, may keep the starting job for coach Paul Johnson. Oliver, a redshirt freshman, has seen his playing time increase, including in last week's 38-28 win at North Carolina .\n\nMarshall said he's confident Johnson \"is going to put the team in the best position to win.\"\n\n\"Ultimately that's what we're all here for,\" Marshall said. \"We want to win games and we want to get back to a bowl game.\"\n\nHere are some more things to know about the Miami-Georgia Tech game:\n\nLOVING ATLANTA\n\nRicht is right at home when facing off against Georgia Tech. He's a perfect 14-0 as a coach at Bobby Dodd Stadium, the Yellow Jackets' home field. Florida State was 5-0 there when Richt was an assistant for the Seminoles, Georgia was 8-0 there when he was the Bulldogs' head coach and Miami won there in 2016. Richt was a Miami player in 1978 when the Hurricanes lost at Georgia Tech.\n\nSTRENGTH VS. STRENGTH\n\nMiami ranks first in the ACC and second in the nation in total defense, allowing 264.7 yards per game. Georgia Tech leads the nation with its average of 377 yards rushing per game. Richt said it will be a challenge for his defense to contain the Yellow Jackets' option attack.\n\n\"Playing against them, for the last 10 years of my career, it is tough on an offense to be sitting there waiting, waiting, waiting for an opportunity, if it holds true to form,\" Richt said. \"But our defense has played well against them in the past and I have a lot of faith and confidence in this week.\"\n\nDECLINING ACCURACY\n\nAn interesting trend with Perry: His accuracy has dipped as games go along. He completes 61.5 percent of his first-quarter passes, 59.5 percent in the second quarter, 55 percent in the third and 33.3 percent in the fourth. Of his 105 throws this season, 99 have come at home \u2014 on the road, he's 3 for 6 with two interceptions.\n\nWHITEOUT GAME\n\nThis will be Georgia Tech's annual Whiteout game, a tradition that began with its 2008 game against Miami. The Yellow Jackets have won three of their last four Whiteout games, including a 28-27 win over Miami in 2014.\n\nCHANGE THE SCRIPT\n\nMiami has called recent players-only meetings in an attempt to salvage the season. \"Sometimes that works. Sometimes that's sort of Hollywood,\" Hurricanes defensive coordinator Manny Diaz said. \"Ultimately that is what it comes down to \u2014 the accountability falls first on us as coaches and secondly it falls on those guys to play.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

We lock our doors and tell our children to watch out for the \u201ccrazies\u201d on the streets that are unpredictable and can harm us. We gaze in astonishment at homeless men and women screaming at no apparent listener. But we fail repeatedly to take reasonable measures to protect our families and communities.\n\nProviding better protection is complicated. Our country is deeply divided. The friction between opposing parties opens gaps to be exploited not just by interest groups and lobbyists, but by fringe extremists. The right to free speech allows for the unfiltered expression of weird notions and sentiments. The First Amendment protects even the most bizarre ideas, that can go viral across social media, and bring together extremists that would not otherwise talk to each other. And, like Long and Bowers, the potentially dangerous individual has access to very lethal weapons.\n\nMore: I see the same fear I felt at Pulse in Thousand Oaks shooting survivors' eyes\n\nThousand Oaks shooting shows inaction on gun violence puts cops in the firing line\n\nThere are better ways to find the next killer\n\nForty years ago, mental health advocacy groups successfully lobbied for laws that restrict involuntary hospitalization and treatment. Compelling involuntary treatment requires showing that the patient is a clear danger to himself or others. These laws may have been a good thing, but the down side is it is not easy to prove dangerousness. The upshot is that many seriously ill men and women, both homicidal and suicidal, do not have access to mental health care.\n\nThey may be clearly paranoid and spewing bizarre and creepy ideas, but they are not certifiably dangerous to themselves and others. They mimic the public discourse heard on mainstream media and evade accountability for their talk and actions. Those on the fringe don\u2019t have the filters to think rationally about conspiracy theories and feral ideas in the public forum, or the control to restrain their fears and instincts. Paradoxically, the courts usually find such accused killers and bombers competent to stand trial and face sentences of life in prison or death.\n\nBut prison or death after the fact doesn't make our country safer. We're still left with a paranoid and emotionally unstable fringe that doesn't satisfy criteria for involuntary treatment, but has virtually unlimited access to assault weapons and guns. Politics make it almost impossible to design effective gun violence prevention policies and improve mental health services. The NRA will continue to oppose restrictions on dangerous weapons, the mental health advocacy groups will campaign to protect patients from being stigmatized, and extremists and politicians will disavow any responsibility for bad actors.\n\nWe need to update gun and mental health laws\n\nLethal gun violence, both homicide and suicide, is the danger right in front of us. It is the leading cause of death among young American men. The rate of mass shootings tripled from 2011 to 2014, the Harvard School of Public Health reports. And the environment has changed in 40 years since the first laws protecting against involuntary commitment were enacted.\n\nToday, highly lethal weapons can get into the hands of more dangerous people than ever, and they can make bombs in their basements. It is time to change the laws on involuntary treatment and enable governmental agencies to better identify potentially violent individuals.\n\nSome like Sayoc and Long have clear records of run-ins with authorities. Others like Bowers have filled the internet with their vitriol and buy the weapons to inflict massive carnage. Such men require tactful and appropriate surveillance by governmental agencies and engagement to deter them from acting. They either need to get into treatment or we need to be assured that they don\u2019t have access to weapons that kill. The evil and hatred that threatens us lives in the minds of men and women around us who need help. Gun violence is a public health crisis.\n\nStephen N.

USA TODAY\n\nThe new iPad Pro has a Liquid Retina display. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nFlirting with buying the brand new iPad Pro? The big question for most is whether the latest Apple device will get the job done.\n\nFirst things first: At $799 to start for an 11-inch model and 64GB and $999 on up for the 12.9-inch version I\u2019ve been testing, the newest power-user tablet unquestionably is Apple\u2019s best iPad yet.\n\nIt\u2019s also the most expensive by a wide margin, especially if you pile on the accessories most of you will need or crave \u2013 notably the $129 Apple Pencil stylus and a $179 or $199 Smart Keyboard Folio. Max out on storage (1-terabyte), choose a model with cellular, pick up the Pencil, keyboard and other accessories and you\u2019re spending \u2013 yikes \u2013 considerably more than $2,000.\n\nThat\u2019s a small ransom. To figure out whether it\u2019s worth it to you, you first have to consider: What will you need it for?\n\nSince Apple often compares iPads to a variety of different devices, let\u2019s examine how the new 12.9-inch Pro stacks up in a head-to-head matchup against other potential options.\n\nThe new MacBook Air. (Photo: Apple)\n\niPad Pro vs. MacBook Air\n\nIt\u2019s no secret Apple promotes the iPad as a stand-in for a laptop.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook pointed out at a launch event for both products in Brooklyn, New York, last week that iPads have outsold all the notebooks from rivals in the past year and that iPads are faster than 92 percent of the laptops sold during that time.\n\nCook was talking about competition from Windows PC vendors, not Apple\u2019s own new notebook, but the not-so-subtle suggestion is that the iPad Pro could probably sub for or replace any laptop.\n\nAs it turns out, Apple just gave its iconic MacBook Air a long overdue refresh. (Let\u2019s assume there\u2019s room in your budget for only one of these expensive new toys.)\n\nThe new iPad Pro has plenty of oomph, thanks to an A12 Bionic chip that is a speed demon. The graphics are splendid, too. And the USB-C port on the iPad Pro \u2013 yep, it\u2019s on the new MacBook Air, too \u2013 connects to a gaggle of devices, including external displays and power chargers.\n\nThat\u2019s all good. Here come the caveats:\n\n\u2022 Dongles and external devices: Be prepared to pony up more cash for the dongles you\u2019ll need to deal with this new USB-C port ecosystem. It\u2019s no coincidence Apple included a few such dongles with my review unit, including one that lets you connect a pair of corded headphones to the tablet now that the standard headphone jack is gone, just as it has disappeared on iPhones. Apple retained the jack on the MacBook Air.\n\nHere\u2019s another bummer. Because of software incompatibilities, you cannot connect external storage drives to the iPad Pro via USB-C because the tablet can\u2019t decipher any of the files on the drive. Score one for your regular laptop.\n\n\u2022 Bye-bye, tangle of cables: In going with USB-C on both the iPad Pro and MacBook Air, Apple also said so long to the Lightning port on the Pro and regular USB on the MacBook Air. That may mean at least semiretirement for the many cords and adapters you\u2019ve been using for years.\n\n\u2022 Face vs. Touch: The iPad Pro also followed the lead of the recent iPhones in ridding itself of the home button and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor in favor of Face ID facial recognition. The learning curve is minor. In this alternate universe, the new MacBook Air doesn\u2019t have Face ID, but it does sport Touch ID.\n\n\u2022 The screen: A quick word about the beautiful high-resolution displays you\u2019ll find on both Apple devices. The screen on the iPad Pro, as with other iPads, relies on the touch-friendly iOS 12 operating system; the new MacBook Air as with all other Macs, lacks a touch screen. In making your tablet or laptop choice, that is something to consider.\n\n\u2022 Getting creative: If you are an artist or architect or other creative professional, your best option likely is the iPad Pro because you can draw or write with the optional pencil. If you want such a capability on a more traditional laptop, consider any number of Windows 10 notebooks that support touch computing, since that is not a stunt for the MacBook Air.\n\n\u2022 Size: Both the iPad Pro and MacBook are obviously thin and small enough to travel with. But if you\u2019re looking to lighten the load in your backpack, the iPad Pro at a little more than a pound comes out your winner.\n\n\u2022 Typing options: The reverse is true if your primary decision rests with the keyboard. Whatever you think of the butterfly-style keyboard on the Air \u2013 I think it\u2019s fine; not everyone will agree \u2013 it is better than the keyboard found on the optional Smart Keyboard Folio. And the Folio doesn\u2019t have a trackpad either, while the one on the Air is silky smooth and more spacious.\n\n\u2022 Keyboard cover: A quick note about some improvements Apple made to the Smart Keyboard Folio for the iPad Pro, which doubles as a protective cover. That cover now protects both sides of the tablet. It is also slightly more versatile in that you can prop up the iPad with the cover from two viewing angles. But other tablet/laptop hybrids \u2013 I\u2019m thinking Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro and Google\u2019s upcoming Pixel Slate \u2013 let you stand up the devices from infinite angles.\n\n\u2022 My bottom line: This is a terrific iPad for those of you who need the tablet, but for most computing tasks, stick with a laptop.\n\nPresident of 2K Sports, Greg Thomas, speaks about the new iPad Pro during an Apple special event at the Howard Gilman Opera House at the Brooklyn Academy of Music before the start of an Apple event in New York, Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018. (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE)\n\niPad Pro vs. gaming console\n\nIn Brooklyn, Apple told all of us that the graphics on the iPad Pro measure up to those delivered on an Xbox One S. And to help punctuate the point, they brought out an executive from 2K Games to show off \u201cNBA2K19.\u201d\n\nHis bold onstage claim: The iPad Pro provides an \u201cexperience that rivals consoles for the very first time.\u201d\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, this may be true, but the claim still feels like a stretch. Even among gamers, anyone spending this much money for an iPad is going to do so for a host of other reasons.\n\nAll this aside \u2013 and I\u2019m more of a casual gamer than a junkie \u2013 I was impressed with the visuals, textures and smooth animations during my own go at \u201cNBA2K19.\u201d The 12.9-inch display provides a generous-sized window into the action, with fairly detailed graphics covering everything from the tattoos on players arms to the cheering spectators in the arena dressed up in hometown fan gear.\n\nI played using thumbs, not a great substitute for an actual game controller, but had fun just the same \u2013 even if the LeBron James-led Los Angeles Lakers team I controlled got thumped by a Denver Nuggets team.\n\nSwitching pastimes, I also enjoyed steering cars by tilting the iPad Pro every which way to race inside the \"Gear Club\" app.\n\n\u2022 My bottom line: Yes, we get that it\u2019s almost silly to suggest that the gaming experience on an iPad is going to match that of an Xbox connected to the wall-sized TV in your home. That said, the games I tried were fun and looked great. But if you're looking exclusively for a dedicated gaming experience \u2013 without all the iPad bells and whistles \u2013 you may want to stick with a console or portable option such as the Nintendo Switch, or even play on your smartphone or PC.\n\n(Photo: Apple)\n\niPad Pro vs. other iPads\n\nAs I mentioned above, the latest iPad Pro is the greatest iPad to date. But it being the best of the lot doesn\u2019t mean it is the best iPad for you.\n\nAll current iPads run the same iOS 12 software, so the steep bump up in price mostly has to do with speed, performance, screen size and quality, and storage capacities, which may be overkill for many of you.\n\nApple\u2019s tablet lineup is pretty broad these days, with an entry level $329 (on up) model with a 9.7-inch display and 32GB of storage that is a perfectly fine choice for the students it was originally pitched to. This iPad even supports a version of the Apple Pencil that used to be reserved just for Pro models. (Important note: We\u2019re talking about the older $99 Pencil, not the newer magnetic variety introduced with the new iPad Pro).\n\n\u2022 My bottom line: If you do need a more robust tablet but don\u2019t want to go all in on the latest models, you can still get an older generation iPad Pro for the last generation Apple Pencil. And Apple stills sells a perfectly capable and an older 10.5-inch mode for $649 on up.\n\nDid you buy or try the iPad?

Alabama won 29-0. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Santos Ramirez is under no illusion about how disappointing this season will be remembered for Arkansas.\n\nThe senior safety is just hoping at this point for one final memorable moment to cap his career in Fayetteville, a chance he will have when Arkansas (2-7, 0-5 Southeastern Conference) hosts No. 9 LSU on Saturday night.\n\n\"No matter what nobody says, we're still men and we're going to show that,\" Ramirez said. \"You can't come in here and think we're just going to lay down for you just because we're 2-7. You've got to come up in here and fight.\"\n\nRamirez has plenty of reasons to put forth his best effort against the Tigers (7-2, 4-2), even though Arkansas is already well on its way to missing a bowl game for a second straight season. He is from Shreveport, Louisiana, and he's more than eager to put an end to a two-game losing streak to LSU.\n\nIt will be a tall task for a Razorbacks team that hasn't won an SEC game since last season and is the lone school in the league without a conference victory this season.\n\nEspecially against an LSU team that is still holding on to hope \u2014 no matter how remote \u2014 that it can climb back into the College Football Playoff picture after its second loss of the season last week \u2014 a 29-0 defeat at the hands of No. 1 Alabama. The Tigers will be playing their first road game in more than a month. Of more concern is how they'll bounce back after investing so much emotion into the shutout loss against the Crimson Tide.\n\n\"This is going to be a very tough road game after a disappointing loss to Alabama, but our team is going to bounce back and we'll be ready to go,\" LSU coach Ed Orgeron said.\n\nDEFENSIVE INJURIES\n\nOrgeron said safety John Battle will dress for Saturday's game, but that he would only play in an emergency situation. The senior was injured on the first play of last week's loss, and he has 37 tackles and three interceptions this season for the Tigers. Also, Orgeron said starting defensive lineman Breiden Fehoko won't play after not practicing all week because of an injury.\n\nGROUND GAME\n\nArkansas running back Rakeem Boyd had rushed for 100 yards or more in three of the last four games, and he had 99 in the fourth game. The sophomore is one of seven SEC rushers with three 100-yard rushing games this season, and he will face an LSU defense that's allowing 147.2 yards per game on the ground.\n\nMORRIS' INTERVIEW\n\nFirst-year Arkansas coach Chad Morris once interviewed with Orgeron while the LSU coach was at Mississippi. Morris was then a high school coach in Texas and didn't get the job with the Rebels, with Orgeron hiring Hugh Freeze instead.\n\n\"I remind him every now and then when I see him that he didn't hire me,\" Morris said.\n\nTIGER PRIDE\n\nLSU is 7-0 in games following a loss under Orgeron, and the Tigers haven't lost back-to-back games since losing three straight in 2015.\n\nRETURNING HOGS\n\nArkansas linebacker Dre Greenlaw and wide receiver Jared Cornelius are expected to return after missing time with injuries in a loss to Vanderbilt two weeks ago. Greenlaw is the SEC's active leading tackler with 300 stops, but he is battling ankle injuries and only played briefly against the Commodores. Cornelius missed the Vanderbilt game with an ankle injury.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They are the Pac-12's last hope for a College Football Playoff berth. At 5-0, the Buffs were the last undefeated team in the Pac-12 and two weeks ago they were 30 minutes away from clinching a bowl berth before blowing a 28-point lead at home to Oregon State. Now they've lost four straight and are staring at the possibility of losing out (Utah, at California) and staying home for the holidays.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nCougars QB Gardner Minshew versus Colorado's patchwork secondary. Minshew is the nation's leading passer. The senior has thrown for 3,517 yards and 27 TDs and is completing nearly 71 percent of his passes, only seven of which have been picked off. He averages 52 throws a game and Colorado could be without SS Evan Worthington, who missed last week's game with a concussion he sustained against Oregon State on Oct. 27.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nWashington State: QB Gardner Minshew and WR Dezmon Patmon. Although Minshew spreads the ball around \u2014 four different players have at least 400 yards receiving \u2014 Patmon is his favorite target with 621 yards and three TDs on 44 catches.\n\nColorado: QB Steven Montez and WR Laviska Shenault Jr. \u2014 maybe. The Buffs have sorely missed Shenault, who was a Heisman Trophy hopeful before suffering a turf toe injury on his right foot against Southern California on Oct. 13. He has missed the last three games as the Buffs have continued to slide down the Pac-12 South standings. Coach Mike MacIntyre said he's still day to day, but Shenault indicated on Instagram this week that he'll play Saturday.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nThe Buffs' four consecutive losses include two one-score setbacks. ... Colorado sophomore CB/KR Ronnie Blackmon had a 59-yard punt return at Arizona last week. ... Shenault had 60 catches for 780 yards and six touchdowns when he got hurt, plus 87 yards rushing and five TDs on just 15 carries. ... The Buffs have two other injured WRs: Jay MacIntyre (concussion) and K.D. Nixon (hip), both of whom left last week's game at Arizona. ...

All visitors will be required to go through the same security checkpoint requirements as ticketed passengers, and meeting travelers at the gates will be restricted to domestic arrivals only.\n\nBeyond sending off or welcoming home a friend or family member, there are plenty of reasons to voluntarily spend time post-security at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.\n\nSEA has a world-class art collection that includes works by Robert Rauschenberg, Louise Nevelson and many other noted national and regional artists, and a live music program that features local performers seven days a week.

(Photo: James Guillory, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAre the New York Islanders a playoff team? Are the Vancouver Canucks this good? Are Bob Boughner\u2019s and Mike Yeo\u2019s jobs safe?\n\nThere is plenty we don\u2019t know early in the second month of this NHL season. But here are five things we do know less than two weeks before Thanksgiving:\n\nLet's make a deal\n\nWhen Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford took his team to task in a candid interview on 105.9 FM in Pittsburgh Wednesday, you can be sure players took notice. He will make a trade. Soon.\n\n\u201cHas this team been together too long? It\u2019s something I always have to watch for,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cWhen do you have to make those changes? The players are doing everything they can to tell me now\u2019s the time.\u201d\n\nRutherford is among the most aggressive traders in NHL history. In an era when GMs lament how difficult it is to make deals, Rutherford has made multiple trades, many having major impacts on his team. Among Penguins he acquired through trades: Phil Kessel, Justin Schultz, Riley Sheahan, Patric Hornqvist and Jamie Oleksiak.\n\nThe Penguins need defensive help and a spark up front. Rutherford said he doesn\u2019t see any desirable defensemen in the market place, but he has a history of finding what he needs. The Los Angeles Kings and Carolina Hurricanes could be willing trade partners.\n\nSwedish sensation\n\nUnquestionably, Elias Pettersson, 19, is the NHL\u2019s best rookie. The debate is whether we should already consider the Canucks forward one of the league\u2019s top players.\n\nDetroit Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill compared him to Pavel Datsyuk because of his deceptiveness. He pointed out Pettersson is more dominant than fellow Swedish countryman Peter Forsberg was at his age. He was the first player in 26 years to score nine or more goals in the first nine games of his NHL career.\n\nPettersson has 10 goals and 17 points in 11 games. He\u2019s slick, quick and magical with the puck and he\u2019s better than average defensively. How good are his hands? Look at videos online that show him juggling while riding a unicycle. As a teenager, Pettersson is already one of the league\u2019s most entertaining players.\n\nMORE NHL\n\nStanley Cup preview\n\nThe Nashville Predators and Tampa Bay Lightning are the two teams that have most lived up to expectations this season.\n\nNobody would be shocked if they ended up in the Stanley Cup Final. Both teams have a balanced roster, rich in skill and playoff experience. Nashville goalie Pekka Rinne, 36, is playing as if he is in the prime of his career. Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy is only now exploring the depths of his talent.\n\nThe Predators have the No. 1 defensive team (2.07 goals per game), and Lightning have the No. 5 defensive team.

(AP Photo/David Richard, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBy the time every NFL team has played eight games, there are some heavily established favorites for The Associated Press NFL awards that are handed out on Super Bowl eve.\n\nNot this year.\n\nMVP? Lots of candidates \u2014 and not just quarterbacks.\n\nCoach of the Year? Nearly every division has a contender.\n\nComeback Player? Some likely Hall of Famers are in the mix there.\n\nSo the AP polled a few of the 50 voters for the awards, including genuine Hall of Famer James Lofton. The theme was clear: There isn't much clarity as we head into the final eight weeks of the schedule.\n\nMVP\n\nThis honor has gone to a quarterback the past five seasons and 10 of 11. Two running backs, Adrian Peterson in 2012 and LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006, broke through the QB domination in the past dozen years.\n\nLofton and some others select Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\n\"So good you just can't take your eyes off of him,\" the CBS analyst says.\n\n\"Maybe this opinion changes next week, given the stellar competition that includes (Todd) Gurley and (Drew) Brees,\" adds USA Today's Jarrett Bell. \"Maybe not, as the kid keeps showing up. A first-year starter as quarterback? Hey, Mahomes is like the new Kurt Warner.\"\n\nPaul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News opts for Brees. Charean Williams of Pro Football Talk prefers Gurley.\n\nDon't forget about Tom Brady, Adam Thielen or Philip Rivers, and perhaps even a defensive force such as J.J. Watt.\n\nCOACH\n\nAnother wide-open field headed by, according to Jenny Vrentas of Monday Morning Quarterback, Kansas City's Andy Reid.\n\n\"I selected Andy Reid ... for his ability to seamlessly transition from Alex Smith to Mahomes,\" Vrentas explains. \"He's been so invested in Mahomes' development that he sits with him on the bench in between offensive series, going over what they see and how they'll attack the opponent next. Reid has demonstrated an ability to keep his offense fresh and tailored to his players, updating his West Coast system with spread concepts pulled from the college ranks.\"\n\nBob Glauber of Newsday points to last year's winner, Sean McVay of the Rams.\n\n\"He's one of the brightest minds in the game, and at 32, is proving not only to be a brilliant play caller, but an exceptional leader as well,\" Glauber says.\n\nNot far behind in our little poll: the Saints' Sean Payton, the Texans' Bill O'Brien, the Bears' Matt Nagy, and the Chargers' Anthony Lynn, whose team \"plays a road game every week,\" Lofton notes.\n\nCOMEBACK PLAYER\n\nRarely has there been such an impressive group vying for an award no one really wants to win considering the implications of a comeback.\n\nFrom Watt to Peterson to Aaron Rodgers, from Andrew Luck to Carson Wentz to Deshaun Watson, from Odell Beckham Jr. to Richard Sherman \u2014 WOW!\n\n\"It's either Andrew Luck or Watt,\" says Williams, \"but Watt has returned to being one of the best at his position. He is playing at an All-Pro and Pro Bowl level. Luck is not one of the top-five quarterbacks in the NFL and maybe not in the top 10.\"\n\nEric Adelson of Yahoo Sports goes for the Colts quarterback.\n\n\"Can't imagine the frustration he's faced,\" Adelson says. \"A pro's pro.\"\n\nVrentas picks Watt.\n\n\"The surgery Watt had last October to put his leg back together after a tibial plateau fracture was so complicated that the surgeons couldn't even be certain that it would work, and that his leg would be able to bear the full weight of his body while running full speed,\" she explains. \"Watt, who has nine sacks in nine games, was undeterred. He wasn't back to full strength in the season opener but has steadily gotten better each week, a scary thought for opponents.\"\n\nOFFENSIVE PLAYER\n\nAnother free-for-all, with Gurley, Mahomes, Thielen, Brees, Michael Thomas and James Conner getting consideration.\n\n\"Before it's done, he could wind up as MVP,\" Bell says of Gurley, his choice in this category. \"Ditto for Brees. Running backs don't get the same love as quarterbacks in the pass-centric environment of the NFL. But if Gurley breaks LaDainian Tomlinson's single-season TD record and the Rams keep winning big, people will have to take notice. Then again, Brees has a few records and has never been MVP.\"\n\nDomowitch, a Brees supporter for MVP, puts Mahomes here. So does Williams.\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER\n\nThis category could be a two-horse race between a pair of thoroughbreds previously honored with the award: Aaron Donald and Watt.\n\n\"Now that's a man who don't need no stinking training camp,\" Bell says of Donald.\n\nEric Adelson of Yahoo Sports prefers Donald, as well.\n\n\"A game wrecker on every down,\" Adelson says.\n\nAdds Glauber: \"Donald is a disruptive force in the middle and already has 10 sacks. The only problem for him \u2014 and the Rams \u2014 is that teams will often go to great lengths to shut him down. Thus, the constant double teams he has to fight through.\"\n\nLofton likes what Khalil Mack has done in Chicago: \"Mack turned the Bears from pretenders to contenders.\" But this train could be a runaway for Donald and Mack.\n\nOFFENSIVE ROOKIE\n\nNo contest.\n\n\"He's the only good thing going for an awful Giants team,\" Glauber says of Giants RB Saquon Barkley. \"Until the Giants figure out their quarterback situation, he'll be wasted in this offense.\"\n\nBut not lost in the awards prognostications.\n\n\"On pace for more than 2,000 total yards \u2014 on a bad team,\" Adelson notes.\n\nDEFENSIVE ROOKIE\n\nChargers safety Derwin James has gotten lots of love, but there's no runaway leader.\n\n\"Darius Leonard and Denzel Ward make this an interesting race for the award down the stretch,\" Williams says.\n\nGlauber leans to Leonard: \"Halfway through the season, he not only led all NFL rookies with 88 tackles, he led all NFL players in that category. He also has four sacks and three forced fumbles and has already won defensive rookie of the week honors twice.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And that puts Matt Barkley in the mix to start Sunday. (AP Photo/Jeffrey T. Barnes, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Bills rookie quarterback Josh Allen's status remains uncertain. Derek Anderson is out. And that means it might be Matt Barkley time for Buffalo.\n\nBarkley is suddenly in the mix to start against the New York Jets on Sunday, some 10 days after Buffalo signed the journeyman to serve as an emergency backup.\n\nCoach Sean McDermott on Friday backed off his previous commitment of having turnover-prone backup Nathan Peterman start against the Jets if Allen and Anderson can't play. Asked about the possibility of Peterman starting, McDermott sidestepped the question by saying he preferred to keep the focus on Allen.\n\nThat's a switch from Monday, when McDermott said Peterman would be the starter.\n\nAnderson will miss his second game due to a concussion .\n\nAllen is listed as questionable on Buffalo's injury report. He's been out since spraining his right throwing elbow in a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14. Allen began testing his arm last week , and practiced on a limited basis for the past three days.\n\n\"We're going to continue to take it one day at a time here,\" McDermott said of Allen. \"It comes down to No. 1, a medical decision and making sure we're doing everything right in terms of the priority of being his health and functionality from a football standpoint.\"\n\nOne consideration is Allen benefiting from an additional break with Buffalo entering its bye week after playing the Jets.\n\nA person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Barkley is being considered ahead of Peterman, but a final decision hasn't yet been made. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because McDermott did not reveal the team's plans.\n\nThe Bills are 2-7 and have lost four straight.\n\nPeterman has thrown seven interceptions in four appearances this season, including three in a 41-9 loss to Chicago last weekend.\n\nThe Bills signed Barkley on Oct. 30. He is on his sixth team in six seasons, and hasn't appeared in a regular-season game since 2016, when he started six games with the Chicago Bears. Barkley was cut by the Cincinnati Bengals in September after hurting his knee in a preseason game.\n\n\"We're all in the mix to start. You could be out there, we never know,\" Barkley said with a laugh, referring to a reporter.\n\n\"I'm a little bit surprised of how quickly I was able to pick up this stuff,\" he added, after taking additional snaps after practice and being the last quarterback to leave the field. \"It's really like riding a bike. You get a little sweat going and it's go time. You've done it for years, so I should be good to go.\"\n\nBarkley was selected by Philadelphia in the fourth round of the 2013 draft, and spent his first two seasons there. Overall, he has a 1-5 record as a starter and has gone 159 for 266 for 1,911 yards with eight touchdowns and 18 interceptions in 11 career appearances.\n\n\"It hasn't maybe been the plan I signed up for when I thought of going to the NFL,\" Barkley said of his numerous pro stops. \"But from what I've been able to learn along the way, I think I'm in a great spot right now.\"\n\nBarkley would become the fourth quarterback to start for the Bills this season, and third in three weeks.\n\nThe carousel at quarterback has contributed to the offense's season-long struggles. Buffalo has scored two touchdowns in its past four games, eight overall, and has an NFL-worst 96 points.\n\nRunning back LeSean McCoy is familiar with Barkley from when the two played in Philadelphia.\n\n\"He's intelligent. He'll have a tough time because they're a good defense and it's a fresh start, but I don't think it's nothing he can't handle,\" McCoy said. \"We'll support him. We'll be behind him. I'm sure he'll have a good game. It'll be a tough matchup. It's a good defense.\"\n\nStarting tight end Charles Clay was ruled out after hurting his hamstring last weekend. Defensive end Trent Murphy will miss his third game with a knee injury. Linebacker Tremaine Edmunds (concussion), running back Chris Ivory (shoulder) and receiver Andre Holmes (neck) are listed as questionable.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

RetailMeNot said the average a parent plans to spend in holiday gifts for their child is $247 \u2013 a larger amount than they will be spending on their parents or significant others.\n\nThis holiday shopping season is significant as retailers will no longer have to compete with former toy giant Toys R Us, which closed all its stores earlier this year.

Meanwhile, 37 percent said they will be going to department stores for their toys, 25 percent at warehouse stores that require a membership and 15 percent at a local children\u2019s shop.\n\nSkupin said the amount of people planning to shop in stores for holiday toys is \"not that surprising,\" as a strong majority of retail shopping still occurs within the brick-and-mortar shops.\n\nAs for why consumers prefer in-store shopping, Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy GlobalData, said it is an \"occasion\" to shop with children. And for shoppers who either don't have children or aren't familiar with their preferences, Saunders said \"it is probably good\" for them to shop in person to inquire about toys, see what look like and ensure they are good fits to give as gifts.\n\nThe cover for Target's toys catalog.

It will place a check and balance on President Trump's power and could tie up his agenda for the next couple of years. USA TODAY\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on May 17, 2017. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Democrats who will take charge of the House in January are planning an \u201call-hands-on-deck\u201d approach to investigating whether President Donald Trump is trying to undermine a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the lawmaker poised to lead a key oversight committee told USA TODAY.\n\nAnticipating subpoenas and multiple investigations, Trump warned on Wednesday that such probes will create a \u201cwarlike\u201d atmosphere in Washington and suggested he would retaliate by investigating Democrats.\n\nBut Rep. Elijah Cummings, who will lead the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Tuesday\u2019s election results, flipping control of the House, were a mandate from voters to provide a check and balance on the administration.\n\n\u201cThey were sending a message that those who do not want to hold this president accountable need to step aside,\u201d the Maryland Democrat told USA TODAY.\n\nDemocrats in Tuesday's midterm elections captured control of the House, though Republicans will keep their dominance in the Senate. The new Congress will be sworn in at the beginning of next year.\n\nCummings and top Democrats on Intelligence and Judiciary committees this week demanded the preservation of documents relevant to the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the forced resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions\u2019 firing could threaten Mueller\u2019s investigation into a host of issues, including whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.\n\nIn letters to administration officials, the leading Democrats wrote that committees are conducting investigations parallel to Mueller\u2019s.\n\nCummings said such investigations will be orchestrated by the House speaker, and that it will be an \u201call-hands-on-deck\u201d approach, rather than just his committee.\n\n\u201cThis is one of these situations where, if we don\u2019t stand up now, our country, our democracy is in deep peril,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nMore: These Democrats could make Trump's life miserable if they win the House in the midterms\n\nTwelve fiery moments from Trump\u2019s White House press conference\n\nTrump threatens gridlock if Democrats investigate him, says it would create a 'warlike' atmosphere\n\nThursday night, Cummings participated in one of the nationwide \u201cNobody is Above the Law\u201d protests, calling for interim Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. Whitaker has previously opined that the Mueller investigation was going too far.\n\n\u201cLet's understand that this democracy is precious,\u201d Cummings told a crowd in Baltimore. \u201cWhen we look at what the president is trying to do \u2013 attacking the FBI, attacking the CIA, attacking the ethics department, attacking our press \u2013 ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve got to fight.\u201d\n\nFrom alleged conflicts of interest to administration scandals, Democrats are looking ahead to a lengthy list of oversight investigations. Cummings said that\u2019s part of Democrats' job, regardless of who is president.\n\nHere are some issues Democrats want to pursue:\n\nTax returns\n\nDemocrats have been calling for the release of Trump\u2019s tax returns since the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nOne of the few members of Congress allowed to request them is the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, which Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts is in line to lead. Asked this week whether he\u2019ll request the tax returns, he responded, \u201cyeah, I think we will.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I hope that the president would do this on his own, largely because every president since Gerald R. Ford has voluntarily done this,\u201d Neal told reporters.\n\nThat\u2019s not likely. During his news conference on Wednesday, Trump said his tax returns were under audit and that \u201cpeople wouldn\u2019t understand it\u201d because they\u2019re so complex.\n\nIf Ways and Means obtains the documents, other committees will be interested. Cummings said he would \u201clove to see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be very helpful in determining whether there are violations,\u201d he said.\n\nNeal said he assumes the request will result in a court case.\n\nPossible conflicts of interest\n\nDemocrats are interested in possible violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars a president from accepting payments from foreign governments without consent from Congress. Among other things, they want to probe the legality of foreign government officials spending money at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump has not divested himself of his ownership interests and assets.\n\nTop Democrats on the Senate and House Judiciary committees and nearly 200 members of Congress sued Trump, alleging he violated the Constitution, and a federal judge in September allowed the case to proceed.\n\nCummings said Americans deserve to see more information relating to Trump\u2019s pledge to donate profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury.\n\n\u201cIf the president is doing things above board, he has nothing to worry about,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia\n\nLook for several committees to bite into this borscht.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat likely to chair the House Intelligence Committee, said as early as February there\u2019s \u201cample evidence\u201d the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Just before this election, he said in a statement Democrats need to \"fully assess what areas of inquiry in the Russia investigation still require a full accounting.\"\n\n\u201cThere are serious and credible allegations the Russians may possess financial leverage over the president, including perhaps the laundering of Russian money through his businesses,\u201d Schiff wrote in an Oct. 12 op-ed in the Washington Post.\n\nTrump has denied any coordination between his campaign and Russia.\n\nRep.

She went home but experienced discomfort overnight and was driven early Thursday to George Washington University Hospital, where she was found to have fractured three ribs on her left side.\n\nGinsburg was forced to miss the formal investiture ceremony for new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh at the court later Thursday morning. But by that night, she was said to be working in her hospital room, according to cast members of the upcoming RBG biopic \"On the Basis of Sex.\"\n\nCourt-watchers on the left and right are attuned to Ginsburg's health because of her status as the leader of the court's liberal wing. President Donald Trump's two high court appointees have created a solid 5-4 conservative majority for the first time in decades, and Senate Republicans have the votes to confirm his judicial nominees for the next two years at least.\n\nGinsburg, however, has shown few signs of slowing down, physically or mentally. She survived colon cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009, received a stent in a heart procedure in 2014 and has been injured in previous falls. None of those incidents have kept her off the bench.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court announced its first opinion from an argued case of the 2018 term.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 TCU coach Gary Patterson figures all those injuries that have piled up for the Horned Frogs could present a problem for No. 7 West Virginia.\n\nPatterson joked it might be difficult for West Virginia to put together a scouting plan against TCU's revolving-door defense.\n\n\"It's been a hard year for us,\" Patterson said. \"This team hasn't quit battling.\"\n\nTCU has seen 20 season-ending injuries and 36 players have missed playing time.\n\n\"I don't know if I've ever been down seven safeties in a three-safety system,\" Patterson said. \"Freshmen say they want to play, so here we go.\"\n\nPatterson and West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen have a mutual respect for each other. Their teams joined the Big 12 together in 2012. Holgorsen always pays compliments to TCU's defense when the teams meet and, injuries aside, Saturday will be no different when TCU (4-5, 2-4 Big 12) plays the Mountaineers (7-1, 5-1, No. 9 CFP).\n\nIn the high-scoring Big 12, TCU has held opponents under 20 points three times in its last five games. Despite the injuries, the Horned Frogs have the Big 12's best pass defense, allowing 194 yards per game.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who plays these spots in a Gary Patterson defense,\" Holgorsen said. \"This will probably be the stiffest test that we've had to date for our offense.\"\n\nAnd conversely, one of the toughest defensive challenges for Patterson. West Virginia's Will Grier has thrown for 28 touchdowns, including three in a 42-41 win last week at No. 15 Texas. He's averaging 327 yards per game.\n\n\"I don't know if we've played anybody at this point that throws like they do,\" Patterson said.\n\nSome other things to know about the Horned Frogs and Mountaineers:\n\nTICK TOCK\n\nTime is starting to run out on TCU's chances to become bowl eligible. The Horned Frogs must win two of their last three games to do that. They have games remaining at Baylor next week and at home Nov. 24 against Oklahoma State. TCU has missed a bowl twice in Patterson's 18 seasons, in 2013 and 2004.\n\nO-LINE KUDOS\n\nHolgorsen gushed about the play of his offensive line last week, especially after left tackle Yodney Cajuste was ejected early in the game for throwing a punch after an extra point. Kelby Wickline replaced Cajuste and saw the most action of his career. The Mountaineers finished with 578 yards of offense, including 232 on the ground.\n\nSUCCESSFUL START\n\nTCU quarterback Mike Collins got his first win as a starter last week. The 6-foot-5 sophomore transfer from Penn completed 17 of 33 passes for 218 yards in a 14-13 victory over Kansas State. Collins took over after Shawn Robinson suffered a season-ending shoulder injury.\n\nCOACHING RANKS\n\nA win would move Holgorsen into second place in school history with 61, one ahead of Rich Rodriguez. Hall of Famer Don Nehlen holds the mark with 149 wins.\n\nTRICKERY\n\nGrier's winning two-point conversion run with 16 seconds left at Texas came after he threw a conversion pass to David Sills but the play was nullified because Texas called timeout.\n\nA year ago the Mountaineers were a victim of trickery at TCU.\n\nKaVontae Turpin took a handoff and swept to the right before stopping and throwing back to Kenny Hill, who sprinted down the left sideline late in the third quarter of the 31-24 victory .\n\n\"That got us last year,\" said West Virginia defensive coordinator Tony Gibson. \"They do a really good job of attacking us.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Kentucky's dreams of a 10-win season and potential New Year's Six bowl appearance likely depend on whether it can earn a rare road victory over Tennessee.\n\nThe 12th-ranked Wildcats (7-2, 5-2 SEC, No. 11 College Football Playoff) have lost 16 straight road games to the Volunteers and haven't beaten Tennessee in Knoxville since 1984, but they head to Neyland Stadium on Saturday as six-point favorites.\n\nKentucky coach Mark Stoops said he wouldn't talk to his players about the program's history of frustration at Neyland Stadium. Kentucky already ended another long streak earlier this season when it beat Florida 27-16 after losing to the Gators for 31 straight years.\n\n\"I think just beating Tennessee is important to us,\" Stoops said. \"Whether there's a streak involved or not, why would that make a difference to our team, really? They don't know anything about 34 years ago. (To) be honest with you, they really don't care. They want to win for their team this year.\"\n\nKentucky was bidding for its first Southeastern Conference championship game appearance in school history, but that hope died with a 34-17 loss to No. 5 Georgia (No. 5 CFP) last week. Kentucky still has a shot at earning its first 10-win season since 1977. The Wildcats follow up this trip to Tennessee by hosting Middle Tennessee and visiting Louisville.\n\nTennessee defensive end Kyle Phillips believes the nature of this rivalry will assure that Kentucky doesn't have any emotional letdown over losing out on the SEC East title.\n\n\"They don't like us a lot,\" Phillips said. \"They're going to play their best game. They're going to definitely come in and play their best game.\"\n\nTennessee also has plenty at stake.\n\nThe Vols didn't reach a bowl game last season and must win two of their final three games to become bowl eligible this year. Tennessee follows the Kentucky game by hosting Missouri and traveling to Vanderbilt.\n\nAlthough Tennessee has won 31 of the last 33 overall meetings in this series, Kentucky won last year's game 29-26 . The Wildcats haven't beaten Tennessee in consecutive years since 1976-77.\n\nHere are things to know about Tennessee's matchup with Kentucky.\n\nWATCH OUT FOR ALLEN\n\nKentucky's Josh Allen has 10 sacks and 14 \u00bd tackles for loss to lead the SEC in both categories. He recovered two fumbles against Georgia last week. Allen will be facing an unsettled Tennessee offensive line that has struggled without left tackle Trey Smith, who is out indefinitely after doctors found blood clots in his lungs last month.\n\nVOLS' RUNNING WOES\n\nTennessee ran for just 20 yards on 26 carries last week in a 14-3 victory over Charlotte . The Vols are hoping leading rushers Tim Jordan and Ty Chandler will be able to play more this week after nagging injuries limited them to a combined six carries against Charlotte. They're facing a Kentucky defense that has allowed just 15.3 points per game to rank eighth nationally in scoring defense .\n\nKENTUCKY'S INJURED LINEBACKERS\n\nKentucky linebackers Kash Daniel and Jordan Jones are both playing with casts on one of their hands due to injuries. Daniel has 58 tackles to rank third on the team. Jones has 55 tackles, the Wildcats' fifth-highest total.\n\n\"I'm sure it's not comfortable for them,\" Stoops said. \"I will say this, they both did some very good things with those clubs on, and it kind of surprised me sometimes, some of the good plays they made. And there's times when you could tell when not having the grip really hurts them.\"\n\nSNELL SEEKS ENCORE\n\nKentucky's Benny Snell Jr. has rushed for 1,008 yards to lead the SEC . He ran for 180 yards and three touchdowns in Kentucky's victory over Tennessee last year.\n\nSnell will face a Tennessee defense that is allowing 4.5 yards per carry . Vanderbilt and Mississippi are the only SEC teams yielding more yards per rush.\n\nGUARANTANO'S EFFICIENCY\n\nTennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano has thrown only two interceptions all season. He has completed 67.6 percent of his passes for seven touchdowns with no interceptions in his last four games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Their offensive line hasn\u2019t lived up to the standard they set last year, and it\u2019s clearly affecting both the run game and quarterback Joe Flacco. This is a symptom of the team\u2019s refusal to keep their best offensive linemen over the years.\n\nTackle Rick Wagner, guard Kelechi Osemele and center Ryan Jensen all earned fat deals after great seasons with Baltimore, leaving the Ravens with holes they\u2019ve yet to properly fill.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s best offensive linemen this season are guard Marshal Yanda and tackle Ronnie Stanley, according to Pro Football Focus. But Yanda is 34 years old and has been injured frequently in recent seasons. It\u2019s very possible, given the little dead money on his contract next year, that Yanda could be one of the veterans cut for salary cap savings. Stanley has just one year remaining on his contract unless the Ravens pick up his fifth-year option. Considering that it will cost $12.5 million for the fifth-year option in 2019 \u2014 a year before Stanley\u2019s option \u2014 it\u2019s not all that affordable.\n\nOutside of Yanda and Stanley, Baltimore has had myriad troubles. Center Matt Skura, guard Alex Lewis and tackle James Hurst have either been injured or ineffective this season. All three have been major holes in protection, a good reason why the Ravens have struggled to run the ball effectively. And all three could have been backups had the Ravens kept their better-performing teammates.\n\nWagner got a five-year, $47.5 million deal from the Detroit Lions. According to Pro Football Focus, he\u2019s earned grades of 73.8 and 75.2 this season and last, respectively \u2014 each significantly higher than what James Hurst or Austin Howard has done at the position since Wagner left.\n\nOsemele signed a five-year, $58.5 million deal with the Oakland Raiders. Outside of this season on an awful Raiders squad, Osemele has been brilliant. His 84.9 and 76.1 overall grades from PFF would have greatly strengthened the Ravens line. Even his 55.0 rating this year is plenty higher than how his replacement, Lewis, has performed.\n\nThe only player not quite living up to his contract has been Jensen. After he signed a four-year, $42 million deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last offseason, Jensen\u2019s deal could easily be turned into a two-year one if he doesn\u2019t improve. Still, this season seems to be an outlier for him as the worst season in his four years earning a handful of snaps or more. If he could come even close to last year\u2019s 71.4 overall grade, he\u2019d be a huge improvement over Skura.\n\nWhile it wouldn\u2019t have been sane for Baltimore to dump nearly $150 million into their offensive line over five years to keep all of those guys, it goes to show they haven\u2019t been wise with the decisions. General manager Ozzie Newsome has attempted to utilize his 80/20 methodology (80 percent of the production at 20 percent of the pay) with the offensive line, and it has bitten the team in the butt this year. It\u2019s a lesson Newsome\u2019s successor, Eric DeCosta, will have to take to heart.", "Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo, of Australia, steers during the first free practice at the Interlagos race track in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 For the first time since 1970, there will be no Brazilian driver in a Formula One race in Brazil.\n\nSo fans in the racing-crazy South American nation, home to eight F1 titles by three champions, are putting all their hopes on two young test drivers who will have a bigger role in the series next year.\n\nPietro Fittipaldi, the 22-year-old grandson of former F1 champion Emerson Fittipaldi, was announced Friday as test driver for Haas starting after the season-ending Abu Dhabi GP.\n\nSergio Sette Camara, the 20-year-old who is the only Latin American driver in Formula 2, will be McLaren's test driver next year.\n\nSette Camara is sixth in the F2 standings with one race to go this season, while Pietro Fittipaldi drove as a part-time driver in the IndyCar Series. Both had their seasons marred by crashes that forced them to miss races.\n\nDespite not having the same impressive results as some of the former Brazilian drivers before they reached F1, Sette Camara and Pietro Fittipaldi are the closest the country has to F1 since Felipe Massa retired last season after a successful career in the series.\n\nThe standards are high for Brazilian fans who were used to cheering for racing greats such as Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, and more recently for less legendary names such as Massa and Rubens Barrichello.\n\n\"I hope these test drivers are better than fans expect. What are their names again?\" said 45-year-old engineer Augusto Daniel, wearing a Mercedes cap. \"I love racing regardless of seeing any Brazilian on the grid, but it is obviously disappointing not to be able to wave our flag for a local driver. It will be a strange experience this time, it will be a bit less emotional too.\"\n\nSenna was the last Brazilian to win the F1 title, in 1991. Pique won his three world titles in the 1980s, and Fittipaldi won two in the early 1970s.\n\nMassa came close with Ferrari in 2008, losing the title by one point to Lewis Hamilton in the last lap of the season-ending race at Interlagos.\n\n\"There are just too many reasons as to why we have no Brazilian drivers on the grid,\" McLaren's sporting director Gil de Ferran said. \"There is the lack of sponsorship deals for younger drivers, there needs to be a better organization of the local racing calendar, professionals need better pay. Also, the country is in a long economy crisis. It is just too many factors. We have to root for our test drivers to succeed for now.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, five-time world champion Hamilton said he doesn't know what Brazil is doing to put drivers into F1, but he can see what other nations are doing well.\n\n\"Mexico is putting a lot of money to put their drivers in F1, Russia too,\" the British driver said.\n\nHamilton said he did not know much about Sette Camara, who had just been announced as McLaren's test driver.\n\n\"But there's definitely space for Brazil, this is a country of hardcore racing fans,\" the Mercedes driver said.\n\nMexican Sergio Perez of Force India is the only Latin American driver on the F1 grid this year.\n\nSette Camara trusts Brazil's traditions in F1 to end the short drought of local drivers in the series.\n\n\"This moment will pass because we had those mavericks opening the way, we are acknowledged as a country where talent flourishes, even if our economy is not as strong as Europe's,\" he said.\n\nPietro Fittipaldi said Brazil's return to F1 could have happened earlier, as he was supposed to test for Haas before the Hungarian Grand Prix this year. He couldn't because he broke both legs in a serious accident while driving in the World Endurance Championship.\n\nHe also believes the shortage of samba on the grid will be gone soon.\n\n\"There are several young pilots, including me, Sergio. I am 100 percent sure there will be another Brazilian driver in F1 pretty soon,\" the young Fittipaldi said. \"And there is also my brother, Enzo...\"\n\nRacing specialists see 17-year-old Enzo Fittipaldi as the biggest upcoming Brazilian talent. This year he had the best performance among all Ferrari academy drivers and ended with a Formula 4 title in Italy. He and Pietro will live together in Maranello, where the youngest will be able to learn from F1 much before he ever has a chance to fight for a cockpit.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

So on his weekly radio show, Saban explained his team\u2019s mentality for that internal struggle using a peculiar analogy about smoking, though admitting he doesn\u2019t really smoke.\n\nSaban said (just after the 58-minute mark):\n\n\u201cYou going to be complacent about where you are? Are you going to continue to celebrate what you\u2019ve accomplished in the past? Are you going to pat yourself on the back? Are you going to relax and get relief syndrome because of a job well done? It\u2019s kind of like having a great meal and smoking a cigarette, for all you people that smoke. I don\u2019t really smoke. But you feel full and comfortable, and it all leads to a natural letdown.\n\nThat sort of sounds like an anti-smoking sentiment, but it\u2019s still an odd comparison. He continued:\n\n\u201cYou have an emotional game, you can\u2019t fall into that emotional trap, aight. And especially in this day and age, you are in the playoff \u2014 you are in the playoff. I mean, that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re in. It\u2019s like the NFL playoffs because if you lose a game in college football, you leave it up to the judges and everybody else, and you don\u2019t control what you can control by how you play and all that. So, this is the time that everybody needs to turn up the tension and redefine the purpose and goal for what they want to accomplish individually and collectively as a team and get sort of a sense of urgency and immediacy about how we go about things and how we get ready. \u2026 \u201cEverybody has something on our team that they can improve on. How important it is to them and how much mental intensity they have and attention to detail all starts in the mindset of how they go about what they do. So and it\u2019s their choice. It\u2019s nobody else\u2019s choice, it\u2019s their choice.\u201d\n\nNever one to overlook a conference opponent, Saban said LSU\u2019s defense last week was the best the Crimson Tide had faced all season \u2014 it was the first team this year to force Alabama to punt on its opening possession \u2014 but he thinks Mississippi State\u2019s is \u201cjust as good or better.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s fine if Saban wants to think that, but his team is a 24-point favorite going into Saturday\u2019s game, so another W seems doable.\n\nIn the second College Football Playoff rankings, Alabama is, again, No. 1 and has an 86 percent chance of making the playoff. Even if it suffers a shocking upset, it would likely still get in as a one-loss team.", "CLOSE President Donald Trump is calling acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker \"a very highly respected man\" as he faces criticism about his appointment to replace Jeff Sessions.

(AP Photo/Young Kwak) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 As Southern California piled up one victory after another in a 14-game winning streak against California, defensive supremacy has always been on the side of the Trojans.\n\nBut the Golden Bears have the far sturdier defense going into the Coliseum on Saturday, and with it comes their best chance at victory since the two programs emerged as the dominant forces in the Pac-10 during the mid-2000s.\n\nCal (5-4, 2-4 Pac-12) is reinventing itself as a team that relies on defense to win games in the second season under coach Justin Wilcox and defensive coordinator Tim DeRuyter. The Gold Bears are allowing 4.8 yards per play this season, which is tied with Kentucky for 22nd among FBS teams.\n\n\"Scheme-wise, it is just a nightmare for a quarterback,\" USC coach Clay Helton said. \"They mix it up really, really well and they are very well taught.\"\n\nCal is allowing 21.9 points per game, nearly half of what the defense conceded in its final season under coach Sonny Dykes in 2016. But that total includes six turnovers by Cal's offense that have been returned for touchdowns, circumstances that have Wilcox convinced his team can make a bowl game for the second time since 2012.\n\n\"We talk about finishing all the time in everything we do,\" Wilcox said. \"Just in how you do everything, whether it's workouts or practice or meetings. It's not about maintenance. It's about we need to play our best football. We have yet to play our best game.\"\n\nFor USC (5-4, 4-3), a return visit to the Pac-12 title game is still in play with wins in its final two conference games and help elsewhere to remove possible tiebreakers against Utah and Arizona State. USC will have to keep its run game rolling against a rush defense that ranks third in the Pac-12, allowing 3.72 yards per carry. The Trojans are averaging 193.6 yards rushing in their five wins, including a season-high 332 yards in a 38-21 win at Oregon State in their last game.\n\n\"The plays went because the line was executing and the backs were running hard,\" Helton said.\n\nHere are some other things to watch for when Cal and USC meet for the 106th time:\n\nSTILL ROTATING: Chase Garbers will start at quarterback for Cal, but Wilcox didn't rule out continuing to use redshirt sophomore Brandon McIlwain in certain situations. McIlwain is second on the team in yards rushing (402) and rushing touchdowns (4). However, the transfer from South Carolina has thrown eight interceptions and lost four fumbles. \"It goes back to trying to create another play,\" Wilcox said. \"We're still developing at that position. Both of those guys had some plays in the game they'd love to have back. The quarterback's always going to be the center of attention, but we have to help him.\"\n\nDEPLETED DEFENSE: USC has been coping with limited numbers at safety for much of this season, and now attrition has hit the cornerbacks. Senior Iman Marshall is a game-time decision because of a sprained foot and ankle, while redshirt freshman Greg Johnson will not play because of a shoulder injury. Senior Isaiah Langley and redshirt senior Jonathan Lockett would start if Marshall is not available, with freshmen Olaijah Griffin and Isaac Taylor-Stuart backing them up.\n\nTWO-WAY PLAY?: The Bears might not have weapons at wide receiver that are capable of taking advantage of USC's secondary in its current state. Cal had three receivers transfer in the offseason, and juniors Kanawai Noa, Jordan Duncan and Brandon Singleton have missed time recently because of injuries. The situation is so bad that Wilcox has considered using safeties Ashtyn Davis and Jaylinn Hawkins on offense. Senior quarterback Chase Forrest could be an option at receiver. \"We've really talked about everything in terms of what's on the table to play at that position,\" Wilcox said. \"It's not out of the question.\"\n\nCATCHING ON: With junior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. out after sustaining a shoulder injury against the Beavers, freshman Devon Williams is in line to see extensive playing time for the Trojans. Williams had three receptions for 77 yards at Oregon State, including a 41-yard touchdown catch for his first career score. Freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has a team-high 38 receptions for 505 yards, will start in place of Pittman.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The president described the people in migrant caravans as not legitimate asylum seekers. (Nov. 1) AP\n\nThe thousands of Central American migrants traveling in a caravan that President Donald Trump wants to stop at the U.S. border began arriving in the city of Juchitan de Zaragoza before dawn on Oct. 30, 2018, in the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. (Photo: Nick Oza, The Republic-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Friday that will deny asylum to immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally, a move aimed at a caravan of Central American migrants moving toward the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe departments of Justice and Homeland Security had previously announced details of the plan to dramatically cut back immigrants\u2019 ability to request asylum, a direct challenge to federal law and international conventions that Trump said is necessary to stop the migrant caravan, which is currently near Mexico City and numbers between 3,000 and 4,000 people.\n\n\u201cPeople can come in, but they have to come in through the ports of entry, and that, to me, is a very important thing,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday. \u201cWe're not letting them in, but they're trying to flood our country. We need the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe laws are obsolete, and they're incompetent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are the worst laws any country has anywhere in the world, and it's only because we don't have the Democrats' votes.\u201d\n\nImmigrants are needed to fill U.S. jobs, Trump acknowledged.\n\n\u201cWe need people in our country, but they have to come in legally, and they have to have merit,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHuman-rights groups blasted the asylum move.\n\n\u201cAsylum is not a loophole, it is a lifeline,\u201d Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International\u00b4s secretary general, said in a statement. \u201cThis policy needlessly places the lives of thousands of people in danger. U.S law states that any individual can seek asylum, whether or not they are at an official point of entry.\u201d\n\nNaidoo said the migrants are not a security threat. They are \u201cmothers, fathers, and children fleeing extremely dangerous situations enduring a perilous journey because they\u2019ve had no choice but to leave their home.\u201d\n\nImmigrants typically are allowed to request asylum whether they present themselves at ports of entry or sidestep those ports and illegally enter the country. But the rules finalized by the administration would bar those who do not enter through ports of entry from making an asylum claim. Those who try to enter illegally would be placed into expedited deportation proceedings. The rules go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. It is similar to Trump\u2019s travel ban from mostly Muslim countries.\n\nImmigrants will still be eligible for admission under the Convention Against Torture, and processing will be handled expeditiously for those having a \u201creasonable\u201d fear of persecution rather than the previous standard of a \u201ccredible\u201d fear, administration officials said.\n\nJustice and Homeland Security officials said they are negotiating with Mexico about accepting deported migrants. Mexico has already agreed to grant asylum to immigrants moving north from Central America, largely from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, which U.S. officials urge as the preferred location to receive asylum from persecution.\n\nTrump hinted at such a change in the weeks leading up to Tuesday's midterm elections as part of a broader strategy in which he focused almost exclusively on immigration in an effort to rile up the GOP base.\n\nDuring a news conference four days before the midterm elections, he said there was \"rampant abuse\" of the nation's asylum system, which saw an increase in claims from 5,000 in 2008 to 97,000 in 2018, mostly fueled by Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.\n\nDuring the year that ended Sept. 30, there were 124,511 immigrants denied admission at ports along the southern border and 396,579 immigrants were apprehended for entering illegally between ports, according to Trump's proclamation.\n\n\"The hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who have unlawfully crossed our border are posing a significant threat to the government\u2019s ability to effectively enforce our nation\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a statement Friday. \u201cPlain and simple, there are too many loopholes in our current immigration system. The vast majority of asylum claims that originated from this system are not meritorious.\u201d\n\nAsylum is a form of protection granted to people who fear persecution in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. From 2000 to 2016, the United States granted asylum to an average of 26,651 foreigners a year, according to Homeland Security data.\n\nThe 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the USA, \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival,\" may apply for asylum. A United Nations treaty signed in 1951 by the United States says \"refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry\" because extreme situations sometimes \"require refugees to breach immigration rules.\"\n\nThe administration's rule change was adopted under a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that allowed the Department of Homeland Security to limit or restrict asylum claims, which already included restrictions against immigrants who were convicted of serious crimes or were designated dangerous to U.S. security.\n\nSeveral groups have already filed lawsuits in California and the District of Columbia challenging the administration\u2019s actions to limit asylum. The latest asylum announcement will add to the litigation, which could be decided by a Supreme Court that includes two Trump appointees.\n\nTo override current rules, the administration used a rationale similar to its argument for its controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries. U.S. law allows a president to sign a proclamation suspending entry to people who are deemed \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nAs the number of immigrants requesting asylum along the southern border increased in recent years, thousands have had to wait on the Mexican side of the border, sometimes sleeping on bridges and streets, to plead their case. The Mexican government, working with nongovernmental organizations and volunteer groups, created a system by which applicants are signed up and allowed to enter U.S. ports of entry in order.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/09/donald-trump-denies-asylum-central-americans-migrant-caravan-honduras-border-immigration/1934635002/", "CLOSE Believe it or not, it isn't the Christian church that's taking issue with Netflix's new show about witchcraft and the occult.

Gruden's Redskins have established a pattern: When they get a lead, they win; when they trail, they lose.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nA look at some key fantasy football questions for Week 10:\n\nWHICH UNDER THE RADAR PLAYERS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR A BIG GAME THIS WEEK?\n\nSeveral Washington players \u2014 quarterback Alex Smith, running back Adrian Peterson, wide receiver Maurice Harris and tight end Vernon Davis \u2014 all have the potential to post big numbers this week against the Buccaneers.\n\nThe Bucs are top 6 or better in fantasy points allowed to each of the main offensive positions. Smith isn't a prototypical fantasy quarterback but the Bucs have given up multiple TDs to the position in six straight games.\n\nLook for Smith to connect often with Harris, who is coming off of a career-best performance with 10 catches for 124 yards receiving last week. With WR Paul Richardson out for the rest of the season and Jamison Crowder's status for Week 10 unclear, Harris should be heavily targeted and has an especially good matchup against a Buccaneers defense that has been torched by fellow slot receivers this season. If Crowder plays, Harris can still be productive on the outside.\n\nEven with the injuries to Washington's offensive line, Peterson should bounce back from his 16-yard performance in Week 9. Tampa Bay has allowed five TDs to running backs over the past two weeks.\n\nHe's expected to play, but tight end Jordan Reed has been limited in practices due to a back injury. He also hasn't scored a TD since Week 1 or recorded more than 43 receiving yards in five straight games. Davis caught five passes for 62 yards in Week 9 and has a favorable matchup against Tampa Bay, which has allowed the second most receiving yards to TEs.\n\nAnother QB to consider is Andy Dalton. He takes on the Saints, who've allowed an average of 354 passing yards to QBs over the past three weeks.\n\nDalton will be without his top receiver A.J. Green, but John Ross has been practicing in full this week and has an opportunity for a big game against the Saints, who have given up the most fantasy points per game (FPPG) to WRs.\n\nAt running back, if Seattle's Chris Carson is either limited or out again in Week 10, Mike Davis has an opportunity for a big game. He faces the Rams, who've allowed two TDs to RBs and at least 101 rushing yards in each of their last two games.\n\nSaints TE Ben Watson has scored TDs in two of his last three games and takes on the Bengals, who have allowed the second most FPPG to the position.\n\nHOW MUCH OF A FANTASY IMPACT WILL DEZ BRYANT HAVE WITH NEW ORLEANS?\n\nLet's face it, Bryant's skills had already been eroding for the past few seasons. It's not fair to expect too much from Bryant this season. Name recognition has put him back on the fantasy horizon. Asking a wideout who hasn't played a live NFL game since last December to step in, learn a new system and be fantasy productive right away is a bit much. Michael Thomas, Tre'Quan Smith, Watson and Alvin Kamara will all easily get more targets on a weekly basis. We all know that QB Drew Brees already loves to spread the ball around.\n\nCAN 49ERS QB NICK MULLENS BUILD UPON LAST WEEK'S PERFORMANCE AND IS HE STARTABLE IN WEEK 10?\n\nMullens has what appears to be a very good matchup in Week 10, however the 1-7 Giants have held opposing QBs to just one passing TD in each of the past two weeks. While WR Marquise Goodwin and TE George Kittle provide Mullens with potential TD makers, WR Pierre Garcon, his most targeted receiver last week, has been limited this week (knee) and his progress should be monitored. Mullens is definitely startable in two QB leagues, but he's a riskier play in other formats. He has a bye in Week 11, but if he's granted another start in Week 12, he'll take on the Buccaneers, and they've given up the most FPPG to QBs entering Week 10.\n\nWHICH COLTS TIGHT END HAS MORE FANTASY VALUE FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON, JACK DOYLE OR ERIC EBRON?\n\nIt depends on your league's scoring format. Both have value, but in point-per-reception scoring leagues, Doyle will likely out-produce Ebron. With Doyle missing five games, QB Andrew Luck targeted Ebron 15 times in the red zone, tied for the fourth most in the NFL. However, Doyle averaged just over seven targets in the three games he's played this season. In those same three games, Ebron averaged just four targets.\n\nWHICH RUNNING BACKS HAVE UPSIDE BASED ON THEIR REST-OF-THE-SEASON OUTLOOK?\n\nCardinals running back David Johnson is an excellent buy-low candidate. Four of his last seven opponents are in the top 10 in FPPG allowed to opposing running backs.\n\nBears running back Jordan Howard has quietly had a productive season. His 3.5 yards per carry is underwhelming, but he's scored five TDs through his first eight games. He is seventh in the league with 20 red zone rushing attempts, and with an average of just under 16 carries per game, Howard is a major part of the Bears offensive scheme and will continue to have ample opportunities to be fantasy relevant.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 10 fantasy tips and insights, please visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Beatles have released a new music video on Apple Music for their 1968 song, \u201cGlass Onion.\u201d The video was released Tuesday and features rare photos and performance footage. The song appeared on their self-titled ninth album, often referred to as the \u201cWhite Album,\u201d which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. (Photo: AP)\n\nReleased on Nov. 22, 1968, The Beatles' self-titled ninth album \u2013 famously known as the \"White Album\" for its blank album cover \u2013 has endured as the group's sprawling, experimental masterpiece.\n\n\"White Album\" fans will be able to celebrate the release's anniversary with a new box set featuring previously-unreleased sessions from its recording process, including 27 acoustic demos and 50 session takes alongside remastered versions of the album's 30 tracks.\n\nWith its 30 songs, the \"White Album\" tracklist spans the highs and lows of the band's catalog, from the album's throwaway tracks \u2013 \"Piggies,\" anyone? \u2013 to several of the Beatles' very best.\n\nBelow, revisit all 30 of the \"White Album\" songs, ranked from worst to best.\n\n30. \"Wild Honey Pie\"\n\nThe \"White Album\" at its most vacantly experimental, \"Wild Honey Pie\" does have its fans. The rest of us, however, just skip over it to get from the album's killer opening run of tracks to \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" an annoying distraction from an otherwise-stellar side one.\n\n29. \"Good Night\"\n\nPoor Ringo Starr, whose vocals just can't carry the album's closing track, a lovely strings composition in theory that totally failed in its execution.\n\n28. \"Revolution 9\"\n\nOne of the album's more divisive tracks is John Lennon's eight-minute composition of tape loops and mish-mashed vocals, which as the story goes, the rest of the Beatles and the band's famed producer George Martin unsuccessfully lobbied to keep off the album. They had the right instinct.\n\n27. \"Honey Pie\"\n\n\"Honey Pie\" has nothing in common with its \"Wild Honey Pie\" counterpart, except their shared distinction as two of the lesser tracks on the album, with Paul McCartney's take on British vaudeville music better left as an experimentation.\n\n26. \"Don\u2019t Pass Me By\"\n\nStarr has marginally more success with the vocals of \"Don\u2019t Pass Me By,\" though the song, his first recorded composition with the Beatles, does sound like exactly that -- someone's first song.\n\n25. \"Piggies\"\n\nBetween the harpsichord and the oinking in the background, \"Piggies\" is not George Harrison's best.\n\n24. \"Savoy Truffle\"\n\nAnother song that falls into the category of the Beatles just wasting time is \"Savoy Truffle,\" famously inspired by Eric Clapton's love of chocolate, though perhaps Clapton himself would agree that it isn't the most compelling topic for a song.\n\n23. \"The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill\"\n\n\"Bungalow Bill\" is the point on the quality scale where the \"White Album\" filler tracks start to tip from frivolous to endearing, though, like \"Wild Honey Pie,\" really didn't need to be in the album's first six tracks.\n\n22. \"Martha My Dear\"\n\nMcCartney allegedly named \"Martha My Dear\" after his dog, which is really the only memorable thing about this somewhat-forgettable \"White Album\" track.\n\n21. \"Birthday\"\n\nIn contrast, \"Birthday\" is one of the album's least-forgettable tracks, thanks to its transcendence into a happy-birthday anthem. Critiquing this song is like critiquing \"Happy Birthday To You,\" but at least the song marginally rocks.\n\n20. \"Cry Baby Cry\"\n\nWith the song buried on the album's weaker side four, it's easy to completely forget about \"Cry Baby Cry,\" with Lennon later calling his song \"a piece of rubbish,\" a harsh but not completely unfair characterization.\n\n19. \"Mother Nature\u2019s Son\"\n\nOne of the many songs inspired by the Beatles' travels in India, \"Mother Nature\u2019s Son\" features a lovely McCartney melody, though his meditations in its lyrics isn't exactly the album's most compelling songwriting.\n\n18. \"I Will\"\n\nAnother perfectly fine McCartney composition, that charms some fans and puts others to sleep.\n\n17. \"Rocky Raccoon\"\n\nThis underappreciated \"White Album\" gem deserves justice, with McCartney doing meandering folk with a wink, complete with Lennon on harmonica.\n\n16. \"Why Don\u2019t We Do It In The Road?\"\n\nYes, the song is somewhat dumb, and definitely goofy, but hearing McCartney absolutely rip into the vocals is an undeniable pleasure.\n\n15. \"Everybody\u2019s Got Something To Hide But Me And My Monkey\"\n\nA love song for Yoko Ono, Lennon's \"Everybody\u2019s Got Something To Hide\" is a ramshackle production, but charmingly so.\n\n14. \"Julia\"\n\nJohn Lennon's ode to his mother could sound a little less lethargic, but his naked emotion still makes it a classic.\n\n13. \"Yer Blues\"\n\nLennon is the opposite of lethargic on \"Yer Blues,\" written as he was spiraling into depression, articulated in the track's raw blues.\n\n12. \"Glass Onion\"\n\nHere, Lennon offered up a cheeky answer to the fans obsessed with the band's mythology, wrapped in a quintessentially Beatles-sounding track.\n\n11. \"Long, Long, Long\"\n\nApologies to \"Julia\" and \"I Will,\" but it's Harrison's love song \u2013 which he later revealed was an ode to God \u2013 that's the best on the album.\n\n10. \"I\u2019m So Tired\"\n\nAn absolute Lennon classic, written as he was sobering up (and likely going through withdrawal) in India, in which he turns his crankiness into songwriting gold.\n\n9. \"Sexy Sadie\"\n\nLennon originally wrote this track to take shots at the Beatles' associate Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, but \"Maharishi\" became \"Sexy Sadie\" in the writing process, and voila, one of the band's best kiss-off songs was born.\n\n8. \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\"\n\nYes, this song is a top ten \"White Album\" cut, because as elementary as its chorus may be, it's one of the band's best melodies, period.\n\n6. \"Revolution 1\"\n\nOf the album's 30 songs, it has seven indisputable classics, with \"Revolution 1\" kicking off the list of top-tier \"White Album\" tracks with its meandering early take on what would become one of the Beatles' most famous singles.\n\n7. \"Back In The USSR\"\n\n\"Back In The USSR\" is McCartney in rockstar mode, offering his tongue-in-cheek take on the Beach Boys' \"California Girls\" with a twist.\n\n5. \"Blackbird\"\n\nFamously known as music's most-covered song, this McCartney staple didn't get that reputation for not being a near-flawless song.\n\n4. \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\"\n\nNot quite as ubiquitous as \"Blackbird\" or \"Back In The USSR,\" \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\" is the album's best example of John Lennon making good on his most indulgent impulses, as he strings together four song snippets, one of which written on an acid trip, for a deeply enjoyable song with one of his career-best vocal performances.\n\n3. \"Dear Prudence\"\n\n\"Dear Prudence\" is the most Beatles-y track on the \"White Album,\" a song \u2013 which is actually about Mia Farrow's younger sister refusing to leave her room in India \u2013 that's the perfect ideal of the band's trademark sound.\n\n2. \"Helter Skelter\"\n\nMcCartney's best Beatles vocals come on the band's hardest-rocking tracks, with poor Ringo's cries that he has \"blisters on his fingers\" an appropriate casualty for a song this good.\n\n1. \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"\n\nThere can only be one No. 1 song, and it's Harrison's crown jewel of the \"White Album,\" a song that's come to define not just his legacy, but the band's, an embarrassment of riches contained in its tight sub-five-minute runtime.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/09/beatles-white-album-turns-50-every-song-album-ranked/1903414002/", "Fifty years ago this month, The Beatles made a splash with their self-titled album, which came to be known as the White Album due to its minimalist cover.\n\nOn Friday, the band released a deluxe version of the groundbreaking double album, filled with outtakes, demos and remastered versions of the songs.\n\nThe White Album anniversary is also an opportunity to deliver a definitive ranking of the iconic band\u2019s albums. Last year, we took on the task of ranking every songs The Beatles wrote, and although listing 13 albums is easier than putting 188 tunes in order, it\u2019s still a much-debated topic among critics, experts and fans that I\u2019m going to take a shot at.\n\nWhy me? Although I was born long after the Beatles left their mark and despite the fact that I\u2019m not a music critic, I\u2019m a die-hard fan who\u2019s listened to their albums countless times and read dozens of volumes about the band.\n\nThe rules: We\u2019ll rank the British releases only (some American records had different song lineups). No greatest hits albums, no Past Masters with their singles releases, none of the Anthology collections.\n\n13. Yellow Submarine (1969)\n\nIt feels like a cop-out listing the film soundtrack last because it\u2019s short and has two songs previously released by the band \u2014 Yellow Submarine and All You Need is Love. But other than the underrated Hey Bulldog, what else is there? Not much, although I re-discovered It\u2019s All Too Much recently and realized it\u2019s better than I previously thought.\n\n12. Let It Be (1970)\n\nThe Beatles were on their way to breaking up, with members of the band fighting with each other as they recorded the album that was meant to get them to work together again. It\u2019s a disjointed mess with a few good songs, so everyone\u2019s glad the group got together to record one more time before disbanding for good (Abbey Road was recorded after Let it Be but released before the latter). I\u2019ll always believe Phil Spector\u2019s heavy-handed producing with his \u201cwall of sound\u201d ruined it, making The Long and Winding Road corny and I Me Mine sound like a different band. The title track still stands the test of time, as does Across the Universe.\n\n11. Beatles For Sale (1964)\n\nWho could blame the Beatles for putting out a mediocre offering in the middle of the insanity that was Beatlemania, when the young group was under the white-hot spotlight of fame seemingly 24/7?\n\nThis was an album that gathered dust for me growing up. Maybe it was all the country music influences or the darker tone on certain songs. But when I came back to it later as an adult, I realized the opening trio \u2014 No Reply, I\u2019m a Loser, Baby\u2019s in Black \u2014 was so much deeper than I had realized. I\u2019ll Follow the Sun is beautiful and the cover of Rock and Roll Music does Chuck Berry justice.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a transitional album for the band, and there are a few of those albums peppered throughout the Beatles\u2019 career \u2014 ones where they\u2019re still figuring new things out just after releasing a seminal album (in this case, it\u2019s the follow-up to A Hard Day\u2019s Night) before they really get it together (Help! was up next). Nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s just not the Beatles at their best.\n\n10. With The Beatles (1963)\n\nSpeaking of which: The band\u2019s follow-up to Please Please Me still feels like they\u2019re figuring things out. The cover versions of Please Mister Postman, Roll Over Beethoven, and You Really Got a Hold on Me are solid, and All My Loving is a near-perfect pop creation.\n\nBut that\u2019s about it. The other Lennon-McCartney originals prove they were still evolving as songwriters (they would absolutely flourish on the next album). Plus, we get our first George Harrison-penned original, Don\u2019t Bother Me and it\u2019s one of the better tracks.\n\n9. Magical Mystery Tour (1967)\n\nIt\u2019s inventive, yes, but a bit all over the place and includes some singles, a few of which were previously released. There are some hits \u2014 Magical Mystery Tour, Fool on the Hill, I Am the Walrus \u2014 and some misses like Flying, Blue Jay Way and Baby, You\u2019re a Rich Man. As far as album experiences go (and that\u2019s something I weighed a lot while compiling this list), the Beatles were tighter elsewhere.\n\n8. Please Please Me (1963)\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet this is a hot take for many Beatlemaniacs, but give me a chance to convince you why this is a better album than you think. The idea of the Beatles\u2019 first recording was to capture the raw energy and sound of their live shows. And it absolutely does that!\n\nWhoever decided to kick off I Saw Her Standing There with Paul McCartney\u2019s emphatic four-count is brilliant \u2014 it immediately takes you to the stage, with no frills. Ringo Starr\u2019s singing on Boys is pure jubilation and Please Please Me was their first of countless earworm hits. And of course, it ends with the grand finale: John Lennon, giving what was left of his vocal cords to cover Twist and Shout.\n\nThere are some clunky moments \u2014 Misery and Ask Me Why are meh and I\u2019ve never been a fan of P.S. I Love You \u2014 but if you couldn\u2019t go to the Cavern Club and experience the band live before they hit it big, this is a pretty great replacement.\n\n7. Help! (1965)\n\nBy this point, the band had settled into a groove: McCartney could write a catchy love song with ease, while Lennon\u2019s Bob Dylan phase (You\u2019ve Got to Hide Your Love Away) was in full swing, along with him beginning to work some of his demons out in the studio (he really was pleading for help at a low time in his life).\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s Yesterday, a hint of the future as the band started expanding beyond the boundaries of what was possible in a recording studio.\n\nIt captures the Beatles completely conquering their genre before they would completely obliterate and redefine it on subsequent albums. In the context of the rest of this list, it\u2019s pretty incredible that Help! is this low.\n\n6. A Hard Day\u2019s Night (1964)\n\nThe band\u2019s first all-originals album brims with confidence. They\u2019re so cohesive and tight on every single tune and showed versatility. From that blast of an opening strum that wakes you up to the minor chords of I\u2019ll Be Back, they zip through different styles, even if the songs are almost all still about youthful romance.\n\nCan\u2019t Buy Me Love is bluesy, And I Love Her has a Latin feel, and I\u2019ll Cry Instead is influenced by country sounds. Listen to the album all the way through and you\u2019ll hear there are practically no weak spots in it (When I Get Home is just okay, but at least it falls in line with the rest of the lineup).\n\n5. Rubber Soul (1965)\n\nThis is where the list gets tougher to finish. How do you rank another album without any holes in it this low? But that\u2019s why they\u2019re The Beatles.\n\nThere\u2019s inventive instrumentation \u2014 a fuzz bass here, a sitar there, all of which must have been jarring to hear from a band that had just finished a pretty straightforward rock album in Help! The songwriting went into some deep, complex places (Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man, I\u2019m Looking Through You). It feels like The Beatles had grown up about 10 years in the span of months, and by the time you get to In My Life, you realize these aren\u2019t the same mop-tops anymore. This is a band that was ready to push some boundaries. It\u2019s also the start of one of the greatest three-album runs in music history.\n\n4. The Beatles, AKA \u201cThe White Album\u201d (1968)\n\nYou know it. I know it. I bet they knew it: There are too many songs that could have been cut to make it a much tighter album.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to what I said earlier. Think about the experience you had listening to this. It\u2019s a roller coaster ride! One second you\u2019re with Desmond and Molly, the next you\u2019re whisked on a children\u2019s story of Bungalow Bill before you\u2019re on the porch listening to McCartney play an acoustic guitar and tap his boots to Blackbird. There\u2019s raw emotion on Yer Blues, political commentary on Piggies, and the sound collage of Revolution 9, which would be everyone\u2019s choice to cut from the double album, but really \u2014 isn\u2019t it weirdly fascinating to listen to all the way through a few times?\n\nThere\u2019s a lullaby, the possible invention of heavy metal, a jazz tune, a clear send-up of the Beach Boys \u2026 it\u2019s exhausting. And while it probably needed pruning, you realize it\u2019s amazing just the way it is by the time you\u2019re done with it. What a trip.\n\n3. Abbey Road (1969)\n\nHow do you end a decade and a group considered the greatest rock band of all time? This seems right. The lads from Liverpool put their differences aside and made the perfect farewell.\n\nThe much-written-about second half medley that ends with, well, The End, is divine, the little Her Majesty encore is a fun little wink, and George Harrison\u2019s two contributions \u2014 Something and Here Comes the Sun \u2014 are a pair of the best tracks the band ever put together. Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer and Octopus\u2019s Garden? Not as great. But that hardly matters.\n\n2. Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)\n\nHow dare I not put that at No. 1? I hear you.\n\nWhat more can I say that hasn\u2019t already been written? The band shut the door on the first half of its career with Revolver, finished touring, and put together a stunning, innovative collection of sounds, words and images. The idea that The Beatles were putting together an album made by a different band only comes in three times on the entire 13-song masterpiece, but it works \u2014 you\u2019re transported away from Beatlemania and arrive somewhere else with these mustachioed gents in their bright uniforms.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t it No. 1, you ask? It\u2019s by a nose, a photo finish, whatever cliche you want to use. Maybe this is 1B to my 1A below, a continuation of the experimentation that began on Rubber Soul combined with psychedelic imagery. Whatever it is, Sgt. Pepper deserves all the respect for breaking down the wall and showing what rock and popular music could be.\n\n1. Revolver (1966)\n\nThe Sgt. Pepper before Sgt. Pepper that blows your mind in a million different ways. The picture painted by the symphony that was Eleanor Rigby, the haze around I\u2019m Only Sleeping with its backwards guitar track, McCartney\u2019s heartbreak waltz (For No One) and the sheer audacity of Tomorrow Never Knows, a song that I swear could be released now and would sound modern. Let\u2019s all remember they did all that without the technology that makes all of those sounds and effects possible with a mouse and a laptop.\n\nLet\u2019s put it another way: The leap from Rubber Soul to Revolver is a larger one than the one from this album to Sgt. Pepper.

Dillon.\n\nThe way Clemson is playing, it's going to take a lot more than that.\n\n\"We're in our championship phase\" of the season, co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said this week as the Tigers prepared for Saturday night's game in Chestnut Hill. \"And we're just continuing to get better.\"\n\nThe 2016 national champions, who lost to playoff winner Alabama in two other years, are in the middle of a historic streak.\n\nWith a victory against BC, the Tigers (9-0, 6-0, No. 2 CFP) would claim their fourth straight Atlantic Division title and remain on track for another playoff berth.\n\nThey already have won three straight road games by a combined 171 points, an ACC record. They have outscored their opponents by 204 points over the last four games \u2014 also a league record \u2014 including a 77-16 victory over Louisville last week.\n\n\"We've been racking off a bunch of records and things that haven't been done,\" Scott said. \"I don't believe there's been an ACC team with four (straight) division trophies since they started the two divisions. So that's something our guys will have an opportunity to accomplish.\"\n\nA BC win would leave the schools tied for the division lead, giving the Eagles (7-2, 4-1, No. 17 CFP) a chance to reach the ACC title game for the first time since Matt Ryan led them to the first of back-to-back appearances in 2007-08. For those who were here when the team went winless in the ACC in 2015, it's the payoff for the hard work through the bad years.\n\n\"Guys are playing with a little bit more of a chip on their shoulder, as you would expect with a big game coming up,\" said linebacker Connor Strachan, a fifth-year senior. \"It's exciting to play the game you love, but with a little weight behind it.\"\n\nHere are some other things to look for in Saturday night's game:\n\nWILL HE OR WON'T HE\n\nDillon, the ACC preseason player of the year after rushing for 1,589 yards as a freshman, has gained 897 yards in seven games so far this season, missing two with a left ankle injury.\n\nIn his absence, Ben Glines ran for 90 yards against North Carolina State and 107 against Louisville; David Bailey had 112 yards rushing against the Cardinals. Against Virginia Tech, when Dillon tweaked the injury but still racked up 96 yards, Travis Levy took over the responsibilities and ran 11 times for 75 yards.\n\nBC coach Steve Addazio is hoping Dillon will serve as the feature back against Clemson.\n\n\"I would say we need all of them, but certainly one guy you would like to have ready to go is No. 2,\" he said. \"A.J., God-willing, will be healthy again, and we can get 30 carries out of him.\"\n\nClemson held Dillon to 57 yards last year and a 3.2 yards per carry average that was one of his worst of his career. The Tigers lead the nation this year in rushing defense, allowing just 2.24 yards per carry.\n\n\"We're going to need that,\" coach Dabo Swinney said. \"These guys know how to run the football.\"\n\nCOLD COMFORT\n\nForecasts of temperatures near freezing aren't scaring Tigers quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who is from Tennessee and has never been north of Virginia. (Clemson's road games his freshman year have been at Texas A&M, Georgia Tech, Wake Forest and Florida State.)\n\n\"It's fun going on the road, experiencing things. New places,\" Lawrence said. \"We know it's in Boston and it's going to be cold. But once we get the adrenaline going, we'll be fine.\"\n\nFAMOUS FAMILIES\n\nThe Boston College roster includes some famous offspring, including offensive lineman Tyler Vrabel, the son of Tennessee Titans coach and former New England Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel; running back Javian Dayne, the son of 1999 Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne; defensive back Tate Haynes, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Michael Haynes; tight end Tito Pasqualoni, the son of former Syracuse coach and current Detroit Lions defensive coordinator Paul Pasqualoni; and kicker John Tessitore, the son of ESPN broadcaster Joe Tessitore.\n\n\"He is definitely in the right place for him, and he loves it there,\" said the elder Vrabel, who went to Ohio State but has been seen wearing BC gear around practice. \"I'm certainly glad he's there with Steve and their staff that can help and mentor him and coach him.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this story from Clemson, South Carolina.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Harvick's bid for a second NASCAR title suffered a massive setback when he was stripped of his berth in the championship race after series inspectors found his winning car from Texas Motor Speedway had been deliberately altered to give him a performance advantage. (AP Photo/Larry Papke, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Kevin Harvick shrugged off a cheating scandal to show he's still a legitimate title contender by winning the pole for his final crack at making the championship race.\n\nAs for what exactly happened with his race-winning car last week, Harvick didn't offer any new information after claiming the top starting spot at ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix.\n\n\"I don't build the cars. I can't tell you what's good and what's bad. I just show up and drive the cars,\" Harvick said Friday.\n\nBut his crew chief, Rodney Childers, said Stewart-Haas Racing modified the spoiler on Harvick's car because other teams were already doing similar alterations. Childers is suspended for the final two races of the season and working at the race shop in North Carolina as Harvick tries to overcome a devastating penalty issued this week for what NASCAR determined was a blatant case of cheating.\n\nHarvick won last weekend at Texas. When the spoiler was removed from his No. 4 Ford during an extensive inspection in North Carolina, NASCAR discovered the part had been altered.\n\nIt is NASCAR's belief that SHR built its own spoiler and tried to pass it off as one distributed by the vendor. The spoiler was offset to the right and NASCAR says it gave Harvick an aerodynamic advantage.\n\nSHR did not appeal the penalty and acknowledged \"NASCAR determined we ventured into an area not accommodated by its rule book.\"\n\nChilders elaborated in a series of tweets early Friday morning in which he said SHR made the decision to move the spoiler after other teams shifted their decklids and spoilers to the right in the previous 1.5-mile race at Kansas Speedway. Childers said it was too late for the team to move the decklid for the Texas race.\n\n\"This year there isn't a number or officiating on the offset of the decklid and spoiler together on the car. And at Kansas we noticed people we were racing had the spoilers and decklids further to the right than ours. And it was too late to move the decklid over more,\" Childers posted on Twitter.\n\nAdditional posts claimed the downforce advantage was \"4 counts. That's 0.04% of the total downforce of the car. If you think 4 counts is the reason we won you're way wrong.\"\n\nHe also said there were no hard feelings between NASCAR and SHR, which has all four of its drivers still eligible for the playoffs and has been the most dominant organization in NASCAR all season.\n\nHarvick leads the series with eight victories, but two were with illegal cars. His Las Vegas victory from earlier this year was disqualified, as was last week's Texas win. That disqualification cost Harvick his automatic berth into next weekend's championship race and Childers and car chief Robert Smith are suspended.\n\nHarvick is still mathematically in contention to advance into the final four and he's a nine-time winner at Phoenix, site of Sunday's final championship-qualifying event. He won at Phoenix earlier this year.\n\nHarvick, the 2014 champion, had no scheduled media availability at ISM Raceway but was required to attend a news conference after winning the pole. He was contentious as he declined to delve into the scandal surrounding his team, but praised the organization for its strong effort Friday.\n\n\"It's more about people than it is about cars and we've got a lot of good people,\" Harvick said. \"You can't drive a slow car fast and you can't beat good people.\"\n\nJoey Logano, the only driver already locked into next week's title race, was not bothered by the accusations against Harvick's team. He also said he's not wondering if SHR, or others, have been cheating all year.\n\n\"Everyone pushes hard and it's nothing new,\" Logano said. \"We like making a big deal out of it, a big stink out of it, but honestly it is part of our sport. There are a lot more items on our cars than there is in football. As competitors we push to that edge and sometimes we go a little over the edge and sometimes it's all about the way you interpret the rulebook.\"\n\nLogano missed the playoffs last year because his only victory of the season was disqualified when his car failed inspection. That infraction at Richmond in the ninth race of the season haunted Logano's team the entire season.\n\nHe's not expecting the fallout from the SHR penalty to slow Harvick, who typically elevates his game during times of crisis.\n\nHarvick's 2014 championship season had brief drama because he shoved Brad Keselowski into a scrum to trigger a melee between Keselowski, Jeff Gordon and their crews. The next week, facing elimination if he didn't win at Phoenix, Harvick dominated the race and advanced into the championship finale.\n\nHe won at Homestead to claim his first Cup title the next week.\n\nHarvick was runner-up the next season \u2014 a year in which he deliberately caused a wreck at Talladega to prevent a bad day hurting his title chances \u2014 and is trying to requalify for the finale for the fourth time in five years.\n\nLogano thinks Harvick will be steady this weekend and the biggest deficit the team is facing is not having Childers at the track to lead the team. Childers is banned from the garage but can be in communication with his crew. He said on Twitter he plans on putting in 14-hour work days at the North Carolina shop this weekend. It is possible he could be on property at Homestead-Miami Speedway for the finale.\n\n\"I think if there is going to be a hiccup, it's not gonna be on Kevin's part,\" Logano said. \"I think Kevin is the type of driver that rises to the occasion. There can be a hiccup in communication. Obviously, they'll be in communication with Rodney ... but it's not going to be very quick. You know the way things get lost in translation sometimes on the phone compared to being face-to-face.\n\n\"You are going to have those situations, and it's for the next two races. I'd say it's a big hit for them, but I'd also feel like that car is going to make it through (to Homestead) as fast as they are and going to their best race track.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMichigan is on the cusp of reaching the heights expected when it hired Jim Harbaugh.\n\nIt took four seasons and a handful of crushing defeats to get here but the fourth-ranked Wolverines (8-1, 6-0 Big Ten, No. 4 CFP) are poised to win their first conference title since 2004.\n\nStay out of the loss column, and the Wolverines could play for their first national title since 1997.\n\nRutgers (1-8, 0-6) should provide nothing more than a simple tuneup Saturday in New Jersey, as will Indiana next week at the Big House before Michigan closes the regular season at No. 8 Ohio State.\n\nThe Wolverines, who haven't lost since the season opener against No. 3 Notre Dame, would have to beat the Buckeyes for just the second time in 15 years to keep any hope at a national title alive. It might take a miracle for Rutgers to beat Michigan, but the Wolverines (48\u00bd-point favorites) also don't want to mess around and play a close game against one of the worst teams in FBS.\n\nNorthwestern was the last team to come close to beating the Wolverines, jumping out to a 17-0 first-half lead on Sept. 29. Since then, Michigan has outscored the opposition 163-48.\n\nNot bad, but consider Michigan probably could have hit that scoring mark against Rutgers the last time it traveled to Jersey: the Wolverines humiliated Rutgers 78-0 and the fear around Piscataway is that it could happen again. Michigan had nine rushing touchdowns and 600 total yards (vs. 39 for Rutgers) in the rout and Harbaugh leads an even better, dangerous team into town this season.\n\nMichigan was 111th in yards passing per game last season and the Wolverines dipped to 8-5. Former Mississippi star Shea Patterson has provided Harbaugh the quarterback he has been looking for since coming back to his alma mater. Patterson is coming off his fourth, three-touchdown game of the season and was named a finalist this week for the Davey O'Brien Award. Patterson has thrown for 1,667 yards with 14 touchdowns and is on the board at Las Vegas with the third-best odds to win the Heisman Trophy.\n\n\"I'm not surprised that the improvement has taken place,\" Harbaugh said. \"He's just getting comfortable with playing in this system. It's been all good since the first day he got here.\"\n\nPatterson just may be the QB that Michigan has needed to win the national championship.\n\n\"He brings a level of focus and mental toughness, a level of intensity to the position that few do,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nHere are other items of note for Saturday's game:\n\nYIKES\n\nHow bad is Rutgers? Kansas, which beat the Scarlet Knights 52-3 in September, will let go coach David Beaty at the end of the season. The hottest ash around Rutgers could be the hot seat that coach Chris Ash sits on as the season winds down. Ash couldn't even muster an underdog rallying cry for his team to knock off the Wolverines, simply stating he just wanted the Scarlet Knights to improve. Hey, at least a field goal will do the trick from the last home game two years ago.\n\n\"They're probably playing as good as any team in the country,\" Ash said. \"In the years that I've coached against Michigan, it's probably one of the best teams they've had.\"\n\nIT'S NOT ALL BAD\n\nHarbaugh actually didn't have to reach to pay Rutgers a compliment.\n\n\"Their kickoff coverage is really impressive,\" he said. \"One of the best in the nation.\"\n\nGuess what? It's true! The Scarlet Knights have allowed a tight 14.88 yards per kick return. Only Eastern Michigan has been stingier on stuffing teams on the kickoff.\n\nIt's the rest of the game of football that gives Rutgers fits. The Scarlet Knights are 128th in total offense and 82nd in total defense out of the 130 FBS teams. Rutgers will host a top-five opponent for the 13th time in program history. The Scarlet Knights haven't beat a ranked team since a win over No. 23 USF in 2009.\n\nJERSEY BOYS\n\nNine Wolverines are from New Jersey: OL Juwann Bushell-Beatty, OL Kraig Correll, DL Michael Dwumfour, DL Rashan Gary, DB Brad Hawkins, DL Ron Johnson, DB Hunter Reynolds, OL Cesar Ruiz and OL Jon Runyan.\n\nBACKUP PLAN\n\nIf Michigan has a big lead in the second half, the backup QB may get some much-needed snaps. Patterson's backup, Dylan McCaffrey, broke his collarbone in last week's win over Penn State. Harbaugh said Brandon Peters and Joe Milton will compete for the job, adding he would rather have Milton save his redshirt eligibility.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nOklahoma wide receiver CeeDee Lamb is tackled by West Virginia cornerback Elijah Battle during their game in 2017. (Photo: Mark D. Smith, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt seems only fitting that the weirdest arrangement in college football \u2013 a conference championship game played in a league that already has a full round-robin schedule \u2013 could feature a rematch only eight days after the teams\u2019 first meeting.\n\nWelcome to the Big 12, where in pursuit of the College Football Playoff, the zany becomes routine.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard, Oklahoma and West Virginia are barreling toward a regular-season meeting on Nov. 23 in Morgantown. But after a super-cool night kickoff on Black Friday, it\u2019s very possible the Sooners and Mountaineers could then reconvene Dec. 1 in Arlington, Texas.\n\nThat isn\u2019t set in stone, of course. With three games left, nothing is. But even as Oklahoma and West Virginia are both in the playoff conversation, the league is thisclose to what might be a nightmare scenario.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard at all to envision the Big 12, in trying to design a system that pushes teams into the playoff, instead knocking itself out of contention. And if it happens, it would all be so very Big 12:\n\nTake the best way to determine a champion \u2013 everybody plays everybody. Add a significant extra layer of difficulty with a rematch. And then, after all of that, do it the very next week.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s less than ideal,\u201d Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby says. \u201cIf it\u2019s two evenly matched teams, it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to see one game going one way and one game going the other.\u201d\n\nIf it happened this year, the playoff would go on without the Big 12.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s all just a hypothetical; Texas and Iowa State have very realistic paths into the Big 12 championship game, too. But with Oklahoma hosting Oklahoma State on Saturday \u2013 Bedlam in Norman \u2013 it\u2019s a good time to revisit how we came to the potential of Sooners-Mountaineers, Parts I and II played in a span of 192 hours.\n\nMaking the whole thing more delicious is this: When the Big 12 decided to restart its conference championship game \u2013 never mind that the league now has only 10 teams \u2013 the Bedlam rivalry was moved away from the Thanksgiving weekend slot it had occupied for about a dozen years.\n\nBowlsby says it was part of a larger philosophical decision not to pin rivalry games to certain weekends. But league insiders acknowledge the move was made because of concern that the Sooners and Cowboys, who had battled for Big 12 supremacy off and on for several years, might have to play twice in a week.\n\nThe only rivalry that\u2019s currently anchored to a spot on the calendar is the Red River shootout. Oklahoma vs. Texas must be played in October because of its tie-in with the Texas State Fair.\n\n\u201cWe made no attempt to game the system,\u201d Bowlsby says. \u201cWe just spread the rivalry games throughout the season.\u201d\n\nWhether that\u2019s a good idea, who knows? And it\u2019s worth noting the league has reversed course. For next season, at least, Bedlam moves back to its old position on the regular season\u2019s final weekend, but Bowlsby says that\u2019s not necessarily a permanent return.\n\nIn the league\u2019s current scheduling format, there\u2019s not necessarily a solution that guarantees a permanent return to the playoff. And that\u2019s what all of these gyrations have been about.\n\nBack in 2014, the first year of the playoff, Baylor and TCU finish tied atop the Big 12 with one loss apiece, but neither got in. Jeff Long, then the selection committee chairman, suggested a huge factor was the \u201c13th data point\u201d earned by Ohio State in a Big Ten championship thrashing of Wisconsin \u2013 and by the lack thereof from the Big 12.\n\nThen-Oklahoma president David Boren told everyone the league was \u201cpsychologically disadvantaged,\u201d and pushed a deep dive into whether or not to expand. After months and a process that became circus-like, the Big 12 stood pat, which was the correct decision. But it also decided to add that 13th data point.\n\nComputer modeling done by Navigate Research, the firm hired to consult during the expansion exploration, suggested the Big 12 would be 10-12 percent more likely of getting a team into the playoff with a conference championship.\n\nNext thing anyone knew, the Big 12 had a championship game. It kept the nine-game, round-robin schedule, which guaranteed a rematch. And it decided not to split into five-team divisions, instead choosing to match the teams with the best records.\n\nAll of which is admirable if the goal is to determine \u201cOne True Champion\u201d (and while that slogan was widely panned, it was actually a pretty good description of the Big 12\u2019s process). No one in any other league runs that kind of gauntlet.\n\nOn the other hand: No one in any other league runs that kind of gauntlet.\n\nAnd beyond all of that is the specter, which looms as very possible this season, of a rematch only week after the teams' regular-season meeting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough good teams, I think our balance is the best of any of the leagues,\u201d Bowlsby says. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have key matchups at the end of the year. There\u2019s a lot of good games.\u201d\n\nAnd always, there\u2019s one guaranteed rematch. Especially if it means two meetings in eight days, the Big 12 will have to hope zany doesn\u2019t become chaos.", "bad url", "CLOSE Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized after a fall in her office on Wednesday evening left her with three fractured ribs.

You have Jaylen Brown, you have Draymond Green, you have Steph Curry \u2014 other guys who have this confidence now to let their voices be heard.\u201d\n\nBut he noted that while social media has aided athletes expressing their social and political opinions, the three-part documentary on SHOWTIME digs deeper into the history of NBA players speaking out over the last several decades.\n\nAs Chopra explained to Kate Fagan on OTL:\n\n\u201cBaseball has called itself America\u2019s pastime for generations, football has had the moniker of America\u2019s game, but when you look at the NBA and basketball over the last 50 or 60 years, it\u2019s actually been the most culturally and socially relevant sport in America. So we really wanted to explore that. Of course, we live in incredibly politicized times, so I would say that did very much drive the narrative as we were working on this over the last 18 months or so. And then this past February, Laura Ingraham went on Fox News and told KD and LeBron James to \u201cshut up and dribble,\u201d and we got a great title.\u201d\n\nThe now-infamous comments from the Fox News host followed one of many of LeBron\u2019s criticisms of the White House when he said President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t \u201cgive a (expletive) about the people.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what Chopra hopes people take away from the documentary \u2014 which was in the works before Ingraham\u2019s comments \u2014 he continued:\n\n\u201cThis idea that sports and politics shouldn\u2019t mix or a lot of people want escapism (with) sports, but if you actually look at this history in not only this country but really around the planet, sports and politics are entangled. You can go back to the 1936 Olympics, the 1968 Olympics (in Mexico City). \u201cIn particular with the NBA, you had civil rights activists like Bill Russell, Spencer Haywood, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson who were not only great players but were active in terms of movements in this country. And so we wanted to explore that, and I think it\u2019s a reminder of the need to actually be engaged and participate in the conversation. And athletes now have that voice and they also have this platform with social media, so I think we kind of wanted to be part of the conversation.\u201d\n\nHere is the trailer for Shut Up & Dribble.", "CLOSE Here are the top ten trendiest cities where many consumers are drawn to and their median home prices.

Slightly more than 3 million homes nationally, or 3.6% of the total, are worth at least $1 million, up from 3.1 percent last year and 1.5 percent in 2012.\n\nNot surprisingly, many of the freshly minted million-dollar units are in California, which already boasts the most in the country.

($903,500 to $1.15 million)\n\nTrulia Senior Economist Cheryl Young attributed the big jump to widespread home price increases in recent years, with the median national home price climbing 7.6 percent the past year to $220,100. The median, or midpoint, of all home prices is up 45.3 percent since 2012.

(Photo: Jessica Forde, Amazon)\n\nHe's neither a suave James Bond nor the ruthlessly efficient Jason Bourne. Instead, John Tavner, the intelligence operative at the heart of Amazon\u2019s \u201cPatriot,\u201d is a spy defined by who he isn\u2019t.\n\nThe emotionally damaged American agent finds himself in familiar spy terrain, enmeshed in dangerous undercover work as a \"non-official cover,\" as the critically acclaimed and darkly funny drama returns for an eight-episode second season Friday.\n\n\u201cHe defies the action hero, the idea (that) they can do anything and they\u2019re the best at everything. He\u2019s not an action hero at all,\u201d says Michael Dorman, who plays the spy who would rather be a folk singer.\n\nJohn\u2019s reluctance and offbeat nature aside, \u201cPatriot\u201d checks off many boxes of the spy genre. It tells the story of a secret mission \u2013 John takes a cover job at a Milwaukee piping company with an overbearing boss (Kurtwood Smith) \u2013 to prevent Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear bomb. (The plan goes woefully awry.) Shot primarily on the streets of Paris, the second season also conveys the genre\u2019s international allure.\n\nProfessional intelligence entanglements complicate the relationship of operative John Tavner (Michael Dorman) and his father, Tom (Terry O'Quinn), in Amazon's 'Patriot.' (Photo: Jessica Forde, Amazon)\n\nBut the series differs in other ways, says creator Steve Conrad.\n\n\u201cIt fits under suspense thriller, those sorts of movies and TV shows that try so hard to be cool. But I\u2019m just really down on cool. \u2026 I see John as anti-cool, maybe that he\u2019s anti- those other\" spies, he says, pointing out one superficial signal: His hero spends most of his time in a ratty green sweater rather than a tuxedo.\n\n\"I wanted to write about (someone) who might find themselves sacrificing, but didn\u2019t get a lot of girlfriends or gadgets out of it. The set of principles that motivate this person are worth writing about, but the superficiality is embarrassing.\u201d\n\nTerry O'Quinn, left, and Kurtwood Smith are two of the stars of Amazon's 'Patriot.' (Photo: Jessica Forde, Amazon)\n\nTo that end, the idiosyncratic John, who has the dangerous tendency to reveal secret information in his autobiographical songs, is based on the late singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt, whom Conrad describes as \u201csupremely intelligent, (with) some psychological trauma.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatriot\u201d also tells a family story: John's real boss is his father, Tom (Terry O\u2019Quinn), a State Department intelligence chief, and is aided by his Congressman brother Edward (Michael Chernus). As with \u201cThe Americans,\u201d the familiar challenges of family relationships are aggravated by the exotic pressures of spy work.\n\nTom set \"Patriot\" in motion in the series premiere, asking his struggling son to take on the dangerous Iranian mission. That spun out of control when John lost a bag of money meant for the anti-nuclear operation, leading to a cascade of problems that continue to bedevil him in Season 2.\n\nJohn Tavner (Michael Dorman), right, is joined by colleagues, including over-enthusiastic amateur spy Dennis (Chris Conrad), in Season 2 of Amazon's 'Patriot.' (Photo: Jessica Forde, Amazon)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest battle for Tom: What is this doing to (John\u2019s) mind and heart?\" O'Quinn says. \"The physical danger is one thing, but what is it doing to your son when you instruct him to kill someone. I\u2019m never quite sure how to say those lines, but Tom has to say them. The consequences of this mission failing are far greater than how it\u2019s going to affect me, my son or any one family. It could affect millions of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatriot\u201d is \u201ca story about this one man\u2019s soul being extinguished and can the people who love him save him in time,\u201d Conrad says. \u201cIt\u2019s so antithetical to other (espionage) shows, where you cheer for the hero to succeed. In \u2018Patriot,\u2019 you cheer for him to quit.\u201d\n\nAs Season 1 ended, John had an exit strategy from his job if he gave the money to a European detective investigating him for a homicide. But family obligations \u2013 Edward has been kidnapped and is being held in exchange for that money \u2013 force him to continue.\n\nDebra Winger joins Amazon's 'Patriot' in Season 2, playing John Tavner's mother, Bernice. (Photo: Jessica Forde, Amazon)\n\nBut there are differences in Season 2: John is out in the open and he gets assistance from fellow operatives, both professional and amateur, in Paris. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to see his friends come back,\" Dorman says. \"You actually get to see him enjoy himself in moments. You might get to see him smile, or laugh even, and be free and easy.\u201d\n\nAnd you might get to see more of \"Patriot,\" as Conrad and Dorman would like a third season. \"There are 10 more hours of things I want to say and do,\" Conrad says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/09/amazon-spy-drama-patriot-goes-paris-season-2/1920850002/", "CLOSE If you're shopping for a new mattress, make sure to keep these 4 tips in mind.

He said it will turn a profit despite its low price \u2013 in part because Tuft & Needle, with more than $170 million in sales in 2017, is gaining cost advantages from its increasing scale.\n\nThe end result is a product that has multiple layers of open-cell polyurethane foam but few of the other features offered by more-expensive options.\n\nHe said the company expects the product to appeal to shoppers who are \"scrappy\" and have \"no interest in trading up\" or who are looking to buy a mattress for their kids or a guest room.\n\n\"If we're going to hit this price point, we do have to take out some of the features and performance, but we still want to make a really comfortable mattress,\" he said. \"We really honed in on pressure release and support \u2013 not so much on cooling technology, not so much on enhanced durability.\"\n\nTuft & Needle has been selling mattresses on Amazon since 2013. But Serta Simmons doesn't have a big sales presence there.\n\nMarino said Amazon didn't pay Tuft & Needle to develop the new mattress but is expected to help boost the product's visibility to shoppers.\n\n\"We need to be wherever our customers are, and people are starting to shift to different platforms, like Amazon,\" he said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/09/serta-simmons-tuft-needle-mattress-amazon/1931296002/", "bad url", "Emma Stone reveals her name was inspired by the Spice Girls\n\nCLOSE The Spice Girls reunion tour everyone \u2014 except Victoria Beckham \u2014 has been talking about for months is finally official.

David Alvarado, travelportland.com", "The Banyan Tree Bangkok's Moon Bar set the bar for rooftop experiences in the city. (Photo: Banyan Tree Hotels & Resorts)\n\nBangkok is one of the most exciting cities in the world. It can also be one of the most exhausting. A day at street level can result in a sensory overload of humid heat, horrendous traffic and assaultive smells. If a traveler is on a beer budget, they can dip into one of the ubiquitous 7-Elevens and buy a pre-moistened cloth towel in the cooler compartment of the store. Those even slightly well-heeled have a more appealing option: They can board an elevator to one of the city\u2019s rooftop bars. Bangkok has \u2013 perhaps out of necessity \u2013 made an art of these high-in-the-sky watering holes. Here is a handful of those most chill.\n\nLebua Skybar at lebua State Tower\n\nThe evening I ascended to the lebua Skybar, 63 floors above the city on the gold-domed lebua State Tower, I shared the elevator with a group of hip and sophisticated young Bangkokians. It was a preview of what awaited. Lebua Skybar is a thrilling experience of dramatic lighting effects, glass and steel d\u00e9cor, and what claims to be the best rooftop river views in the city. Skybar got an extra blast of attention when the bar was featured in the movie \u201cThe Hangover Part II.\u201d If feeling adventurous, order a Hangovertini composed of scotch, Martini Rosso, apple juice, and Zen green tea liqueur, topped off with a sprig of rosemary. Lebua Skybar is a popular destination so at any given time it may be crowded. I found the glass stairway can be a little disorienting so a little extra attention when walking is recommended. The good vibes can be extended by taking dinner at lebua\u2019s rooftop al fresco restaurant, Sirocco.\n\nMoon Bar & Vertigo at Banyan Tree Bangkok\n\nBanyan Tree\u2019s resorts are famous for their Zen elegance. The Banyan Tree Bangkok, in the laid-back Sathon neighborhood of the city, is no exception. Its famous early-on-the-scene Moon Bar set the bar for rooftop experiences in the city. The property\u2019s Moon Bar and Vertigo restaurant occupy the total space of the building\u2019s top 61st floor. The elongated shape of the bar, with its unobstructed views, is often compared to that of a spaceship. Guests can also enjoy an al fresco rooftop meal at Vertigo, which has also given its name to one of Moon Bar\u2019s signature cocktails, the Vertigo Sunset, a concoction utilizing Malibu Rum and a variety of fruit juices. Arrive before sunset to snag one of the prime seats on the bar\u2019s sofas. Rainstorms will drive the action one floor below, so check the weather report before setting out. As humid and hot as Bangkok can get, don\u2019t show up at Moon Bar and Vertigo in shorts and flip-flops. (This is actually good advice for visiting any of Bangkok\u2019s stylish rooftop bars. Start with a baseline of smart casual and move up from there.)\n\nThree Sixty Lounge at Millennium Hilton Bangkok\n\nAt the Three Sixty Lounge, located on the 31st floor of the Millennium Hilton Bangkok, the buzz is all about the 360-degree cupola offering panoramic vistas, with the main attention-getter being views of Bangkok\u2019s famous Chao Phraya River. The cupola is an enclosed space; those looking for a more open experience can opt for sofas located in the major area of the bar, where the curved glass windows are practically floor to ceiling. Jazz music forms a backdrop at the Three Sixty, with occasional live players, most often a vocalist accompanied by a pianist. The bar is located in Bangkok\u2019s Thornburi neighborhood which is a fair distance from the sizzling downtown area. For a more intimate and quiet rooftop bar experience, arrive early; if people-watching is your thing, arriving after 9 p.m. is best.\n\nSpeakeasy Rooftop Bar at Hotel Muse\n\nMost rooftop bars in Bangkok opt for a sleek and sophisticated look, with lots of bold lighting effects. The Speakeasy Rooftop Bar goes in another direction entirely and seeks to meld Asian style with subtle hints of a classic American 1920s-era speakeasy. As to be expected, gin is the drink of choice here, with 40 varieties to choose from. The bar is located on the 25th floor above the Hotel Muse. Entrance is made by first going to the hotel\u2019s Long Bar and then continuing on to Speakeasy through an unobtrusive painted door. Once inside, the bar affords beautiful views of Bangkok\u2019s Sukhumvit and Sathorn neighborhoods.\n\nCru Rooftop Bar Bangkok\n\nThose who want to combine shopping with a drink at a rooftop bar should consider the Cru Rooftop Bar Bangkok, which is located above the Centara Grand hotel at CentralWorld, a huge shopping complex. The bar commands the 59th floor and presents 360-degree views of the cityscape. The interior design is a chic white-on-white punctuated by a glowing circular bar set off by an illuminated arch that changes hues as the evening progresses. Champagne lovers will relish an exclusive variety of bubbly from G.H. Mumm Champagne, and if you\u2019re looking for a wow-worthy Instagram shot, order a Swallow\u2019s Nest, an Elyx vodka and Cointreau concoction with a variety of fruit juices that arrives at the table in its own dome-shaped birdcage.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/food-and-wine/2018/11/09/bangkoks-stunning-rooftop-bars/1935513002/", "", "", "Rudy Del Rio (left) a builder with David Weekley Homes, speaks with MacKenzie Manygoats (middle) and Joshua Willis of Arizona Pipeline Company during installation of gas and electric lines in the Verrado development in Buckeye Nov. 5, 2018. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic)\n\nStorm Johnson was concerned about finding work upon leaving the military after five years as a Marine. He said he had some trouble preparing job applications, largely because it was difficult to translate what he did in the military to civilian job skills.\n\nBut Johnson, who now lives in Chandler, Arizona, soon realized the process wasn't that difficult. With the assistance of a recruiting firm that helped him polish up his resume, he received a couple job offers and eventually accepted a position with a contractor that provides technical services for Intel.\n\n\"I had a job lined up before I left military service,\" said Johnson, who left earlier this year.\n\nOne of the many benefits of a strong job market is that veterans returning to civilian life are finding opportunities more plentiful than in years past. Not everyone is faring equally well \u2013 some former military enlisted personnel who lack college degrees are struggling. So are some with military-connected physical or emotional disabilities.\n\nBut overall, things have gotten better\n\nSeveral years ago, as the military was scaling back involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, the jobless rate for \"trigger pullers\" was off the charts high, said Mike Starich, CEO of Orion Talent, referring to Army soldiers and Marines trained in firing weapons but lacking in leadership or technical expertise.\n\n\"Learning how to shoot an M-16 isn't a highly transferable skill,\" said Starich, whose company helped to find jobs for Johnson and some other veterans interviewed by The Arizona Republic.\n\nNow, mirroring dramatic improvements in the overall jobless rate, former military people stand as good a chance as anyone in finding a job. Even better, perhaps. The jobless rate for former military personnel this Veterans' Day stands at 2.9 percent, below the national unemployment rate of 3.7 percent.\n\nMaking progress\n\nStarich identified a couple programs that seemed to have helped, aside from economic improvement generally. One was the \"Joining Forces\" campaign initiated under former First Lady Michelle Obama that encouraged employers to hire veterans.\n\n\"That got a lot of buy-in from companies,\" he said.\n\nAnother initiative was to include certain groups of veterans within the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, in 2014. This barred federal contractors from discriminating against protected classes of veterans and required these employers to recruit and hire recently discharged military personnel.\n\nAt the time, Gulf War veterans faced higher unemployment and earned less money than non-veterans of similar ages and education levels, with men faring worse than women.\n\n\"It's definitely working,\" Starich said of the latter program.\n\nIn a Prudential survey conducted around that time, two-thirds of veterans said they had trouble transitioning to civilian life; job hunting was listed as the top barrier. Prudential hasn't updated the survey, but with more veterans working, the obstacles have been easing.\n\nTranslating skills\n\nIt helps that scores of employers have recruited veterans in recent years. Another plus is that many companies value the skills that veterans possess.\n\n\"What employers appreciate the most is that we've been through the maturation process,\" said Justin Clark, a former Marine. He now works as a field service engineer for Southwest Medical Resources, where he maintains and repairs medical-imaging equipment, following work in aviation electronics in the military.\n\n\"We show up on time, we work hard and we're resourceful,\" said Clark, who lives in Surprise, Arizona.\n\nCompanies value veterans for their qualifications, composure, productivity and skills, according to a survey this year of more than 100 human-resources and recruiting professionals by Orion Talent.\n\n\"Veterans also can pass background and drug tests,\" said Starich. \"That's a big deal with the labor market so tight.\"\n\nHowever, the Orion study, and the earlier one from Prudential, did indicate prospective employers don't always understand the skills picked up in the military by applicants.\n\nStarich cited the example of a Navy fire-control technician.\n\n\"That sounds like it has something to do with installing sprinklers in a building,\" he said. \"But it actually controls a gun or missile system connected to radar.\"\n\nBranching out\n\nVeterans themselves aren't always sure which jobs they might qualify for.\n\n\"Nothing I learned in the military directly taught me how to build houses,\" said Rudy Del Rio, a former convoy-arranging logistics officer for the Marines and a foreign-forces adviser who helped train Afghan military personnel.\n\n\"But it gave me a foundation of skills for project management and insight for working with other people to get where we need to be.\"\n\nToday, after earning a graduate management degree from Arizona State University, Del Rio, who lives in Surprise, works as a residential construction supervisor for David Weekley Homes.\n\nRudy Del Rio (left) speaks with Drew Anderson of Southwest Residential Interiors inside a bathroom of a home under construction in the Verrado development. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic)\n\n\"The military helped me be accountable, decisive and able to lead people through unclear situations,\" he said.\n\nDel Rio's advice to job-searching veterans is not to limit themselves to their occupational specialty in the military.\n\n\"Be willing to adapt your skill sets, and don't be afraid to learn new skills,\" he said.\n\nOther adjustments\n\nFinding jobs, while easier than in the past, isn't the only obstacle facing veterans. There's also a need to learn how civilians interact in the workplace. Veterans describe civilian work atmospheres as more relaxed and casual than in the military, with lines of command often not as clear-cut.\n\nSean Passmore, a military-hiring adviser at financial-services firm USAA in San Antonio, said cultural challenges for veterans include learning how to dress in the workplace, tolerating small talk and meetings that don't always start on time, and learning to recognize which people are in charge in a uniform-free environment.\n\nManaging a career path also can be more difficult, without someone directing where you will be working, what you'll be doing and for how long.\n\nRudy Del Rio (right) speaks with masons Ignacio Pineda (left) and Rafael Aguilar, in the backyard of a home under construction in the Verrado development. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic)\n\n\"It's not always a straight-up ladder, as with the military,\" he said.\n\nWorkplace benefits, such as health insurance and 401(k) retirement plans, also can be tricky.\n\n\"The military handles a lot of your life activities, such as housing and health care, so you don't have to think of that,\" said Johnson.\n\nFor Clark, one of the biggest changes was a reduced number of vacation days.\n\n\"I went from 30 days a year to 10,\" he said. \"You also have to start thinking of costs you didn't incur in the military.\"\n\nJJ Montanaro, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who now helps former veterans deal with financial issues, doesn't see veteran personal-finance issues as substantially different from Americans overall. For example, a lot of former veterans are living paycheck-to-paycheck, as many Americans do, and they often haven't saved sufficiently for retirement, like a lot of other people.\n\nMontanaro, who also works for USAA in San Antonio, considers budgeting a key exercise for those leaving or planning to leave the military.\n\n\"They will need to add some new budget lines, such as for health-care costs and increased taxes,\" he said.\n\nImportance of preparation\n\nOne of Montanaro's key tips for service members is to build up savings before leaving the military.\n\n\"If you have a stash of cash, then you don't need to take that first job but can wait to find something that better suits your desires and needs,\" he said. \"It's all about having a plan and following it, rather than letting things happen to you.\"\n\nPlanning ahead makes sense for job seekers, too. \"Where a lot of vets fail is relying too heavily on the six to eight weeks of paid vacation they might get\" upon leaving the military, using this time to take it easy rather than searching for a job, said Johnson.\n\nRudy Del Rio (left), a builder with David Weekley Homes, speaks with MacKenzie Manygoats (middle) and Joshua Willis of Arizona Pipeline Company during installation of gas and electric lines. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic)\n\nClark suggests that military personnel begin the search well before leaving.\n\n\"Start looking even if you think you might re-enlist,\" he suggests.\n\nBut overall, as noted, things have improved dramatically for people leaving the military, with the job market this Veteran's Day among the strongest it has been in decades.\n\n\"The hidden reality is that what has happened is really good news,\" said Starich.\n\nReach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2018/11/09/job-market-brightens-veterans-returning-civilian-life/1925001002/", "All Japan's Yuki Yanagita, right, rounds third base as he is welcomed by teammates at home after hitting a walk-off two-run home-run off MLB All-Star closer Kirby Yates of the San Diego Padres in the ninth inning of Game 1 of their All-Stars Series baseball at Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018.

(Photo: NOAH BERGER, AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google is promising to be more forceful and open about its handling of sexual misconduct cases, a week after thousands of high-paid engineers and others walked out in protest over its male-dominated culture.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters\u2019 main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional, so workers can choose to sue in court and present their case in front of a jury. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after complaints from its female employees prompted an internal investigation. The probe concluded that its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you\u2019ve shared,\u201d CEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to Google employees. \u201cWe recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It\u2019s clear we need to make some changes.\u201d Thursday\u2019s email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nLast week, the tech giant\u2019s workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest what they consider management\u2019s lax treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct. The protest\u2019s organizers estimated that about 20,000 workers participated.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men\u2019s exploitation of their female subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \u201cMeToo\u201d hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle will provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct. It\u2019s requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nBut Google didn\u2019t address protesters\u2019 demand for a commitment to pay women the same as men doing similar work. When previously confronted with accusations that it shortchanges women \u2014 made by the U.S. Labor Departmentand in lawsuits filed by female employees \u2014Google has maintained that its compensation system doesn\u2019t discriminate between men and women.\n\nThe changes didn\u2019t go far enough to satisfy Vicki Tardif Holland, a Google employee who helped organize and spoke at the protests near the company\u2019s Cambridge, Massachusetts, office last week.\n\n\u201cWhile Sundar\u2019s message was encouraging, important points around discrimination, inequity and representation were not addressed,\u201d Holland wrote in an email responding to an AP inquiry.\n\nNevertheless, employment experts predicted the generally positive outcome of Google\u2019s mass uprising is bound to have ripple effects across Silicon Valley and perhaps the rest of corporate America.\n\n\u201cThese things can be contagious,\u201d said Thomas Kochan, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor specializing in employment issues. \u201cI would expect to see other professionals taking action when they see something wrong.\u201d\n\nSome employers might even pre-emptively adopt some of Google\u2019s new policies, given its prestige, said Stephanie Creary, who specializes in workplace and diversity issues at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cWhen Google does something, other employers tend to copy it,\u201d she said.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct against the creator of Google\u2019s Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest-paying executive and computer-programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google\u2019s employees worldwide, and it\u2019s lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance has created a \u201c brogammer\u201d culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/11/09/google-bows-worker-pressure-sexual-misconduct-policy/1940552002/", "CLOSE Michelle Obama's new memoir \"Becoming\" will give readers their most intimate look yet at the life of the former first lady.

USA TODAY\n\nSouthern California coach Clay Helton stands on the sideline before his team's game against Texas in 2017. (Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Spor)\n\nA mere 12 months ago, the college football industry braced for one of the largest coaching realignments in recent memory. A combustible mix of cash-flush schools, angry fan bases and antsy coaches fueled a series of moves that would ultimately result in 20% of the Power Five programs welcoming a new coach in 2018.\n\nBut this fall, college football is acting more like a New Year\u2019s Eve partygoer nursing a hangover on the couch with a bottle of Pedialyte. Everyone, it seems, needs a break.\n\nIn several conversations across the industry this week with people who spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic, a consensus on what the coaching carousel might look like has begun to emerge. Though Kansas got things started by making its long-anticipated firing of David Beaty official, the primary driver of college coaching movement is more likely to be the NFL than a rush of high-profile schools deciding it\u2019s time for a change.\n\nPart of that slowdown is, quite simply, related to money. Though some athletics directors are finally admitting the industry has been fiscally irresponsible in giving coaches guaranteed buyouts that reach into the tens of millions, they are undoubtedly an effective deterrent to schools that might otherwise have a quick trigger.\n\nBuyouts loom large this year, in particular, at Southern California, Auburn and North Carolina, none of which are expected to change coaches despite disappointing seasons and growing fan unease.\n\nOne year after handing Gus Malzahn a 7-year, $49 million contract (about 75% of which was guaranteed), Auburn was never realistically going to fire him, something athletics director Allen Greene confirmed this week to Auburn Undercover.\n\nThough the Trojans do not seem headed back to elite program status imminently under Clay Helton, Southern Cal extended him after last season\u2019s Pac-12 championship and would owe him a boatload of money, though how much exactly is unclear because his contract isn\u2019t public. Some informed speculation in the industry puts the number above $15 million. Either way, athletics director Lynn Swann is not likely to make a change \u2014 though we\u2019ll see how much the temperature changes if USC loses to UCLA and Notre Dame to end the season.\n\nNorth Carolina, meanwhile, is a job a number of rising coaches would be interested in. But even though Larry Fedora is 4-16 over the past two seasons, those familiar with the situation do not anticipate that North Carolina will spend the required $12.2 million to get out of his contract.\n\nIf those three schools stand pat, where will the movement come from?\n\nHere are some pressure points that could tilt the carousel one way or the other:\n\nThe NFL\n\nWith pro teams moving toward college concepts offensively and wanting to extract maximum value from young, cheap quarterbacks by playing them early, there is expected to be more interest than usual in college coaches.\n\nThough Oklahoma\u2019s Lincoln Riley will be a hot name for the Cleveland Browns job, particularly given his connection to Baker Mayfield, it\u2019s a long shot that he\u2019ll actually leave Oklahoma. Another college name that has bounced around the rumor mill for Cleveland is Iowa State\u2019s Matt Campbell, an Ohio native with deep roots in the state. Baylor\u2019s Matt Rhule got an interview in Indianapolis last year, and the program\u2019s improvement this season (the Bears are 5-4 going into the final three games) could inspire teams to take another look.\n\nMichigan\u2019s Jim Harbaugh will be connected to NFL openings every year until he finally takes one. And with Notre Dame currently 9-0 and possibly playoff bound, expect another round of NFL speculation to hit Brian Kelly, who has established impressive stability in South Bend after some turbulent seasons.\n\nStanford\u2019s David Shaw has shown no real inclination to make the jump to the NFL to this point, but it\u2019s worth asking if the program has gotten a little stale of late.\n\nJeff Brohm\u2019s decision\n\nWith Louisville sinking deeper into the abyss every week, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine a scenario where Bobby Petrino returns in 2019. The play here for Louisville is no secret. Purdue\u2019s Jeff Brohm is a rising star and a favorite son, and the pull to go home (particularly for his family and those around him) will be significant. By the same token, don't be surprised if Brohm winds up on some NFL lists \u2014 remember, he was a backup quarterback in the league for nearly a decade \u2014 or becomes the primary target for Notre Dame or Ohio State, should either of those jobs come open.\n\nIn other words, Brohm is going to have some options, a reality that is not lost on Purdue athletics director Mike Bobinski. While there\u2019s always a chance he could stay, Purdue\u2019s financial limits will be tested here if Louisville comes in aggressively after Brohm at the end of the season.\n\nEven in the worst-case scenario for Purdue, however, Brohm showed that it\u2019s possible to win there, and with so few schools making changes, the Boilermakers could end up as one of the better jobs on the market.\n\nThe state of Kansas\n\nMake no mistake, Jeff Long was hired this summer as athletics director for one reason: To fix football. So to think that he hasn\u2019t spent the last few months working diligently on a plan to place Beaty would be foolish.\n\nMultiple people familiar with Long\u2019s thinking insist his focus has been on experienced head coaches who are not working this season and that an announcement on a replacement could come well before the end of the season. That would allow the new staff to get a running start in recruiting, particularly with the December signing period playing such a big factor now in coaching changes.\n\nThe early speculation has focused on former LSU coach Les Miles, and for good reason. Miles and Long overlapped at Michigan in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and Long targeted Miles in 2012 when he was the athletics director at Arkansas (Miles got a contract extension, and Long ended up hiring Bret Bielema).\n\nAnother name to watch here is former Arizona State coach Todd Graham, who is an established winning college coach and would bring an exciting offense plus Texas recruiting ties. Other coaches who fit the profile include Butch Jones and Gene Chizik.\n\nThis could be a rare year where both Kansas and Kansas State change coaches.\n\nThough 79-year old Bill Snyder has amassed the power to hang on as long as he wants, his window of opportunity to stage a graceful exit is becoming smaller. Nobody will say it publicly because Snyder is such a legend, but there\u2019s been real fear about Snyder making his retirement a protracted behind-the-scenes fight, contingent on his son Sean being named his successor.\n\nWith Kansas State now 3-6 overall and 1-5 in the Big 12, longtime Kansas City Star columnist Vahe Gregorian called on Snyder to step down this week, and there seems to be more momentum behind the idea that this will be his last season. But until he announces it publicly, you never know.\n\nBielema, a former K-State defensive coordinator, could be a fit here. North Dakota State\u2019s Chris Klieman, who has three FCS national titles, has a strong connection to Wildcats athletics director Gene Taylor.\n\nOther nuggets\n\n- Nobody has a great grasp of what\u2019s going on at Maryland, where Matt Canada is 5-4 as the interim coach. Given how poorly the school handled DJ Durkin\u2019s ouster and the uncertainty surrounding key figures at the school, including athletics director Damon Evans, anything from retaining Canada to cleaning house completely is in play.\n\n- Georgia Tech (5-4) has stabilized after an awful start, but the last three games are all tough. Paul Johnson\u2019s buyout is a reasonable $4 million, and there hasn\u2019t been much juice around the program lately. How the Yellow Jackets finish could set the mood at a school that intrigues a lot of coaches.\n\n- Colorado may be worth keeping an eye on. The Buffaloes have lost four in a row after a 5-0 start and have a fairly tough close. There has been tension at times between coach Mike MacIntyre and athletics director Rick George over the years, according to people with insight into the program, but the $10 million buyout will make it difficult to change coaches even if there\u2019s a complete collapse.\n\n- Vanderbilt is on the verge of hiring an athletics director, likely within the next week or so, which could determine how the football program is evaluated. Derek Mason (22-36 overall, 7-30 SEC) has some winnable games to finish the season and perhaps get Vanderbilt to a bowl game for the second time in his five seasons. That could be important in forming a first impression for the new boss.\n\n- Some Group of Five jobs that agents are keeping an eye on include East Carolina, Western Kentucky, Charlotte, UNLV and Middle Tennessee.", "Le\u2019Veon Bell was certainly watching the Pittsburgh Steelers trounce the Carolina Panthers on Thursday Night Football, and once again, the NFL world was hanging on every word.\n\nDays after his latest barrage of weirdness on Twitter \u2014 a pair of tweets written upside down \u2014 he posted about how \u201cspecial\u201d JuJu Smith-Schuster is and seemed to be rooting for fellow running back James Conner to \u201cgo crazy.\u201d\n\nBut then there was this tweet that had everyone attempting to read between the lines.

(Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 The Steelers are cooking. So why potentially mess with a recipe that's working by introducing an ingredient that could ruin the whole meal?\n\nThough the AFC North leaders just stormed to a fifth consecutive victory Thursday night by throttling the Panthers 52-21 at Heinz Field, they'll almost certainly face a pivotal dilemma in the coming days: What to do with Le'Veon Bell, who's back in Pittsburgh, assuming he reports to his team by Tuesday \u2014 the deadline that will determine whether he plays during the 2018 season?\n\nThe possibilities may seem tantalizing.\n\nImagine an offense that appears to already be operating near maximum capacity bolstered by a dual-threat all-pro. Might Bell and James Conner be an even more imposing tailback tandem than what the Saints enjoy with Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram? Could a team averaging 35.4 points during its win streak boost that figure significantly? Would Bell's presence complete a formula that could end this franchise's decade-long quest for its \"Stairway to Seven,\" the next Lombardi Trophy \u2014 and one that would give the Steelers two more Super Bowl wins than the Patriots, Cowboys or 49ers.\n\nAnswer: I doubt it and think it might be more likely he upsets the whole ingot cart. In fact, if Bell returns, the Steelers might be better off leaving him where he's been all season \u2014 in mothballs.\n\nHere's why ...\n\nChemistry\n\nIn a league where players almost never rip peers who are handling their business \u2014 contract negotiations \u2014 Pittsburgh's locker room was shockingly critical of Bell when he diverted from last year's post-franchise tag plan by opting not to report prior to Week 1. That anger eventually morphed into staunch support and respect for Conner as he helped drive the team up the standings following a 1-2-1 start.\n\nThe latest emotion has been frustration over constant questions about the \"will he, won't he\" scenarios as they pertain to Bell's opaque plans. All-pro guard David DeCastro pretty well summed up it after Sunday's win at Baltimore: \"Honestly, no one cares anymore,\" he said of the Bell dilemma. \"Why would I? I don't want to waste the energy.\"\n\nI asked Ben Roethlisberger directly Thursday night if it would be easier or harder to try and reintegrate a star player into an attack already firing on all cylinders (457 yards against Carolina).\n\n\u201cYou know what,\" Big Ben tersely replied, \"I\u2019m not gonna comment on someone that\u2019s not in this locker room right now.\u201d\n\nNFL players are a forgiving lot, and the public message if Bell comes back might be brothers embracing one of their own. But it also seems like it might not be nearly that simple behind closed doors.\n\nTHURSDAY NIGHT ROUT: Big Ben perfect as Steelers roll\n\n'NO INTENT': Roethlisberger says Reid was apologetic after late hit\n\nWEEK 10 PICKS: Can Cowboys stop slide in Philly?\n\nBell-Conner committee? Really?\n\nIt's easy to assume Bell could just plug in alongside Conner, the NFL's second-leading rusher behind Todd Gurley entering Week 10 and a versatile weapon who has produced at a level wholly comparable with his predecessor's historic levels.\n\nThe Steelers have hit high gear with Conner as their workhorse. Yet Bell is also accustomed to being the man, getting a minimum of 336 touches in three of the past four seasons, including an NFL-high 406 in 2017. And there was no sharing last year when Conner was a rookie (he didn't catch one pass and averaged slightly more than two touches per game).\n\nBell also hasn't played in this offense under new coordinator Randy Fichtner. Asking Fichtner to incorporate an incoming player geared for a high volume of work at this stage of the season seems unusually disruptive.\n\n\"We have stuff rolling as a unit right now,\" said Steelers tight end Jesse James on Thursday. \"But Le'Veon is such a great player. We've all seen what he's done in his previous years.\n\n\"But you got to play one day at a time.\"\n\nIn sum, this isn't a situation like New Orleans, where Kamara and Ingram are used to splitting the load and even being on the field simultaneously \u2014 and a spot where Ingram was able to parachute right into Sean Payton's familiar scheme coming off his four-game suspension.\n\nThe whole prospect of a timeshare simply looms as problematic for a duo that's never had to do it in the NFL. Conner is young, hungry and hardly needs to be coddled (though he did go into concussion protocol Thursday). Conversely, Bell's camp has been hyperfocused on how much he's used heading into free agency. Yet how would a volatile veteran react if he's getting, say, 35 yards on seven touches while also trying to cement the case someone should pay him at least $15 million annually (Gurley money), and maybe closer to $17 million (Antonio Brown money) given his hybrid skills, next year?\n\nGame ready?\n\nBell essentially needed the month of September in 2017 to work his way into football shape after missing the entire offseason program, training camp and preseason. He averaged 78.7 yards from scrimmage in those first three games before settling into a groove over his last dozen when he churned out 142.5.\n\nYet how long would it take him to harden his armor and find his rhythm in a platoon role \u2014 especially since he last played competitive football Jan. 14, Pittsburgh's divisional playoff loss to Jacksonville? Certainly, given Conner's presence and output, Bell couldn't reasonably expect the 25-30 touches he's historically gotten while trying to reach his peak level.\n\nRunning backs also have an alarming track record of breaking down after holdouts. Just ask Larry Johnson, Maurice Jones-Drew, Steven Jackson or Jamal Anderson.\n\nThe Steelers might just have to put Bell through a de facto November training camp during midweek practices to get him sufficiently calloused and \u2014 potentially \u2014 ready for action. Which brings me to a final point.\n\nThe Steelers still control Bell's future\n\nBell can issue all the cryptic tweets and social media rationales he wants. But at the end of the day, he's completely mismanaged this situation. By finally showing up, he'll take home nearly $6 million the rest of the year ... and that means he will have left about $8.5 million on the table.\n\nAs for the opportunity he so desperately covets to test the open market and has tried to orchestrate? It still may not be up to him.\n\nThe Steelers could choose to franchise Bell a third time in 2019, as financially prohibitive as that might be. They could also try to slap the less pricey transition tag on him \u2014 that would theoretically invite several suitors since they wouldn't risk losing first-round draft picks to pry Bell loose \u2014 but would also allow Pittsburgh the opportunity to match any offer.\n\nAnd that could mean the Steelers might ultimately let one of those tags dictate Bell's salary (again), then find a way to fit him into next year's salary structure \u2014 Pittsburgh currently has roughly $20 million in cap space for 2019 \u2014 before finding the best deal they can while shipping him to the location of their choosing ... unless, of course, Bell wants to waste another year of his prime by sitting out.\n\nBut if the Rooney family, general manager Kevin Colbert and coach Mike Tomlin are mulling such deep state options, how much incentive would they have to expose such an asset to injury \u2014 one who's been largely motivated by self-interest in recent years \u2014 who could drastically change the organization's long-term planning calculus if he's only going to be little more than a rotational back in 2018? Seems preferable to just let Bell take some licks on the practice field \u2014 get him ready to go in case Conner suffers a significant injury \u2014 but otherwise keep the 26-year-old encased behind emergency glass.\n\nIt could be the approach that's ultimately best for all parties.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "", "NYON, Switzerland (AP) \u2014 European soccer is starting an esports version of the Champions League with a $280,000 prize fund.\n\nElectronic Arts Inc. and UEFA announced the creation of the eChampions League on Friday, a month after the English Premier League launched an ePL with the video game behemoth.\n\nThe UEFA competition will be restricted to PlayStation, which is owned by Champions League sponsor Sony.

(Photo: Philip G. Pavely, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLe\u2019Veon Bell ensured that the intrigue regarding his potential continues as he issued a couple of cryptic tweets Wednesday night, one day after he bid his offseason home of Miami farewell.\n\nBell has returned to the Pittsburgh area but still hasn\u2019t visited Steelers headquarters, per multiple reports.\n\nBut the Bell watch very well could soon end, because the disgruntled running back must report by next Tuesday if he is to play at all this season. If the all-pro does return rather than decide to remain out, coach Mike Tomlin and his staff have a predicament on their hands.\n\nMore: USA TODAY Sports' Week 10 NFL picks: Cowboys-Eagles rivalry highlights uninspiring group of matchups\n\nThe Steelers started off slow this season, but have won four consecutive games and five of their last six. Meanwhile, Bell's replacement James Conner has thrived, rushing for 771 yards and 10 touchdowns on the season after Thursday night's thrashing of the Panthers.\n\nConner, who has topped the 100-yard mark in four of his last five games, has earned the respect and confidence of his teammates and coaches alike.\n\n\u201cThe kid, to be completely honest about you, he just has a focus about him,\u201d offensive guard Ramon Foster told USA TODAY Sports when asked about Conner two weeks ago. \u201cHe wants to be good. He wants to be that guy. You can tell it\u2019s in him. I love watching him run because he has a passion about him. It\u2019s not just us.\u201d\n\nBut each week that Conner has shined, the question resurfaces: Do the Steelers really need Bell? And what happens to Conner if Bell returns?\n\nThe answer to the first question is yes. The Steelers absolutely need Bell, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, who is coming off of back-to-back seasons with at least 1,200 yards rushing and 600 yards receiving. With high-powered offenses in Kansas City and New England potentially standing in their way this postseason, Pittsburgh will need all the help it can get.\n\nThe second question, however, doesn't have to be an either/or proposition. Conner and Bell can coexist.\n\nThe Steelers first must make sure Bell is in game shape, and it could take some time for him to round into form. But once he is ready, Tomlin has a chance to field one of the most dominant backfields in the league.\n\nA two-back system can work in the NFL. Just look to the hottest team in the league, the Saints, who utilize both Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara.\n\nLast year, Ingram rushed for 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns as the bruising back. The faster Kamara provided another dimension and exceptional pass-catching ability while accounting for 1,554 yards from scrimmage (728 rushing, 826 receiving) and 13 touchdowns. And two have been tremendously effective working in tandem again this season.\n\nIngram and Kamara thrive simultaneously because coach Sean Payton understands situational football and identifies the best way to capitalize on an opponent\u2019s weaknesses. Payton rotates his backs and knows how to use one to set up the other for a big gain. There are even times when they\u2019re on the field at the same time, which can create even more headaches for opponents.\n\nLikewise, Bell and Conner have different styles and can attack defenses in a variety of ways. Pittsburgh could use Conner as the inside runner just as the Saints use Ingram. And since Bell likely will want to limit his workload and injury risk, Tomlin can deploy him as a change-of-pace back and pass-catching threat out of the backfield, just as New Orleans does with Kamara.\n\nLine them up in the back field together at times. Send Bell in motion and line him up as receiver. Do you key on Bell as a defense? Do you key on Conner?\n\nBut one thing should be clear: Conner should not lose his starting job. He has been producing all season. His teammates respect and appreciate him and know he\u2019s in this with them. Bell made the decision that he believed was best for him, and now he must work his way back into the good graces of others in the organization. If he accepts whatever role he receives, all will be well in the Steel City.\n\nGreat situation for Bryant\n\nSpeaking of New Orleans, the Saints showed that they\u2019re not satisfied with their already potent offense when they signed wide receiver Dez Bryant on Wednesday.\n\nThere are still some around the league who don't Bryant, out of work since he was released by the Cowboys in April, as a difference maker, even in a No. 2 or 3 role. Despite his track record, some former opponents have said he doesn\u2019t get off the line as well as he once did.\n\nBut Bryant still has a chance to make his mark in New Orleans. He just turned 30 and might not be a downfield burner, but he still could be a threat. Bryant does some of his best work snagging short passes and then running after the catch. Similar opportunities should arise with Drew Brees throwing to him.\n\nIt's true that Bryant hasn't had a thousand-yard or double-digit-touchdown season since 2014. But the Cowboys' offense as a whole also struggled for long stretches under offensive coordinator Scott Linehan.\n\nThe Saints also have a true No. 1 receiver in Michael Thomas. His presence means Bryant no longer will command the attention of the top opposing cornerback.\n\nBryant has one of the greatest offensive minds in the league as his head coach and a quarterback still at the top of his game in Brees. He should produce for the Saints, giving the team more balance at receiver and possibly easing some pressure on Thomas.\n\nFalcons flying high again?\n\nAfter a 1-4 start to the season, the Falcons appear to have hit their stride and now have won three consecutive games.\n\nPaving the way for their success is an offense that has netted 400 yards and averaged 31 points per game in the ongoing win streak.\n\nPeople within the organization point to two factors: stellar play from Matt Ryan and great leadership from the quarterback during the week.\n\nRyan is posting career highs in completion percentage (70.8) and yards per game (335.6). That success partially stems from his connection with his weapons beyond wide receiver Julio Jones.\n\nRyan has brought along young players like rookie wide receiver Calvin Ridley, who leads the team with seven touchdown catches, running backs Tevin Coleman and Ito Smith and tight end Austin Hooper. As a result of their extra post-practice work, the quarterback feels more comfortable with them in games and has done a better job of taking what\u2019s available to him rather than forcing the ball to Jones or Mohamed Sanu in less-than-ideal situations.\n\nThis approach has led to improvement in the red zone, where the Falcons rank seventh in the league this season, scoring on 69 percent of their trips inside the 20. That\u2019s a marked improvement over last season when Atlanta ranked 23rd, scoring just 49 percent of the time in the red zone.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "", "", "CLOSE Ventura County has set up a Family Assistance and Unification Center where shooting victims and their families can seek help after the mass shooting at Borderline Bar and Grill, Wednesday night.

(Photo: Christophe Archambault, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDays after losing control of the U.S. House and dismissing his attorney general, President Donald Trump travels to Paris this weekend for ceremonies to mark the end of World War I \u2013 an era that began a foreign policy debate revived by Trump in the current era.\n\nIn the two decades following the carnage of the First World War that ended in 1918, the United States turned inward, shunned the leadership of international organizations, and practiced economic protectionism through tariffs on other country's products.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nTo critics, Trump \u2013 and some other world leaders \u2013 are following the kind of nationalist path that, a century ago, led to economic depression and eventually a Second World War.\n\n\"We may be repeating history by returning to the kinds of polices of the 1920s and 1930s,\" said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and co-author of \"The Empty Throne: America's Abdication of Global Leadership.\"\n\n\"Out of those decisions,\" Daalder said, \"came rampant political, economic, and military nationalism that ultimately led to the re-start of war in 1939.\"\n\nTrump, who boarded Paris-bound Air Force One on Friday morning, is pursuing an \"America First\" foreign policy he says designed to make other countries treat the United States more \"fairly.\" From the campaign trail to the White House itself, Trump has argued that the United States has borne too many of the burdens of global defense, and that other nations are \"ripping us off\" through free trade.\n\n\"You have nationalists, you have globalists,\" Trump said this week at the White House. \"I also love the world \u2013 and I don't mind helping the world \u2013 but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\"\n\nAt this point, Trump's weekend in Paris is more about ceremony than substance.\n\nThe American president and some 60 other world leaders will gather at the base of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris for an Armistice Day Centennial Commemoration. It takes place Sunday at 11 a.m. Paris time \u2013 exactly 100 years after the war officially ended, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918.\n\nWhile in Paris, Trump also plans to visit a pair of American cemeteries from the World War I era, one near the site of the Battle of Belleau Wood and the other at Suresnes. The president said he will be representing \"the heroes of our country from World War I,\" and he is proud to go there.\n\n\"It should be a very beautiful period of time,\" Trump told reporters Friday, \"the 100th anniversary of the ending of World War I.\"\n\nTrump had planned to host an American military parade in Washington, D.C., this weekend to mark the centennial of the world war's end. Only after that idea fell through did he decide to attend the Paris event.\n\nIn terms of policy, Trump will also hold a bilateral meeting with his host, French President Emmanuel Macron, a critic of re-emerging nationalism on the world stage. Their agenda includes the civil war in Syria and Trump's decision to withdraw from a high-profile international agreement, the Iran nuclear agreement.\n\n'America First' stirs worry in Europe\n\nWhile he has at times seemed to have a rapport with American president, Macron has criticized the Trump administration for some its \"America First\" actions.\n\nOne focus of criticism has been Trump's decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), a 1987 arms control deal designed to prohibit Russia from developing mid-range missiles capable of reaching Western European cities.\n\nIn response, in an interview with Europe 1 radio, Macron talked about creating a \u201ctrue, European army,\" because \"we have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\"\n\nHe cited Trump's decision on the INF: \u201cWhen I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s Euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security.\u201d\n\nTrump and his aides said current Russian missile development is in violation of the INF treaty. Russia denies it.\n\nThe issue could surface in Paris. Russian President Vladimir Putin is also scheduled to be in Paris this weekend. He and Trump may well bump into each other, though no formal meeting is set.\n\nDomestic politics could also intrude on Trump's Paris mission.\n\nIt comes less than a week after congressional elections in which Democrats won control of the U.S. House of Representatives, even as Republicans maintained control of the U.S.Senate.\n\nTrump will travel two days after dismissing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a decision critics saw as a move toward shutting down a special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn visiting Paris, Trump is following a trail blazed by predecessor Woodrow Wilson. The first president to travel to Europe while in office, Wilson went to Paris to work on the peace treaty that capped World War I.\n\nIn imposing harsh reparations on Germany, and confirming new borders in middle Europe and the Middle East, the Versailles Treaty in the view of many historians sowed the seeds of future conflict.\n\nA century ago, Wilson pushed to have the Versailles Treaty include creation of a \"League of Nations\" designed to prevent future wars. But the Senate rejected U.S. participation in the league, amid protests that the American entry into the world war had been a mistake that cost too much of the nation's blood and treasure.\n\nThroughout the Jazz Age of the 1920s and the economic depression of the 1930s, the United States stayed largely aloof from world affairs.\n\n\"The close of World War I marked the beginning of a dark period in the history of the United States,\" said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a professor of international affairs at Georgetown University.\n\nThe nation proclaimed neutrality amid the rise and militarism of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan, into the breakout of another war in Europe in 1939. Neutrality did not end for the United States until Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.\n\nAfter the American triumph in World War II, presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman sought to avoid what they saw as the isolationist mistakes of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe United States created and led international efforts like the United Nations, NATO and the Bretton Woods conference to forge an international financial system that included the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.\n\nFor the next seven decades, no United States president seriously questioned America's commitment to global leadership \u2013 until Trump.\n\nHe has described NATO as obsolete, and says the United States is spending too much for the defense of Europe. He has criticized the presence of U.S. troops in places like Japan and South Korea. He attacks groups like the World Trade Organization, calling them unfavorable to the United States.\n\n\"He doesn\u2019t know much history,\" said Margaret MacMillan, professor of history at the University of Toronto and author of \"Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed The World.\" \"I think rather he sees everything like a real estate deal \u2013 for someone to win someone else has to lose.\"\n\nIn a September speech to the United Nations, Trump said that \"America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control, and domination.\"\n\nWorld affairs experts said the current risks are less a massive global conflict than nation-vs.-nation competitions that could lead to trade wars or crackdowns on political freedoms.\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has threatened or placed tariffs on China and the European Union, and they have retaliated with tariffs targeting American products.\n\nThe results have included higher prices and fears within the business community about the impact on global economic growth, though the U.S. is also involved in negotiations for new trade agreements with China and the EU.\n\n\"I don't think that one can dismiss the possibility of a return to a world that is populated by nationalists and competitive nation states,\" Kupchan said.\n\nThere is also the possibility that Trump and \"America First\" are passing phases.\n\nTrump \"doesn\u2019t care or concern himself with an international order,\" MacMillan said. \"And yes, he reflects some \u2013 but only some \u2013 of the tendencies in American thinking about the world post 1918.\"\n\n\"But,\" she added, \"lots of Americans then and now thought that a stable prosperous world where nations work together was better than the alternative.\"\n\nMore: Commemorate the Great War\u2019s centennial at the National WWI Museum & Memorial\n\nMore: Supreme Court's latest church-state conundrum: Must a 'peace cross' memorial to World War I vets come down?\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/09/donald-trump-takes-his-america-first-agenda-wwi-commemoration/1922004002/", "None\n\nVolkswagen, the maker of the Beetle, expanded its product offerings to include microbuses in 1950.

(And in this instance they can play with their food, because this DIY recipe, courtesy of Kelly Dixon at Smart School House, is entirely edible.)\n\nIngredients\n\n1 cup of pre-made frosting (vanilla or white)\n\n2 \u00be cups of powdered sugar\n\nOrange food coloring\n\nSmall craft stick for the stem\n\nVarious pumpkin accessories like green cupcake liners or whatever you have in your home\n\nVarious play dough toys or utensils from your kitchen\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd the powdered sugar to the frosting in slow increments using the mixing paddle attachment on your mixer, continually scraping the sides of the bowl. If you don\u2019t have this type of mixer, just mix in a large bowl.\n\nBefore you add all of the powdered sugar, touch the play dough and, if it feels at all sticky, add the rest of the powered sugar.\n\nAdd the orange food coloring until you reach your desired shade of orange.\n\nConsidering that it is kind of hard to measure exactly one cup of frosting, you might have to eyeball the last quarter cup of powdered sugar that is necessary for this play dough.\n\nIt WILL take a lot more powdered sugar than it looks like though (just continue to test the stickiness and say no to sticky play dough).\n\nRoll it into one big ball and make sure it is not crumbly or sticky. If, by chance, you added a little too much powdered sugar, don\u2019t worry! We aren\u2019t perfect! Simply sprinkle a little olive oil onto the play dough and BOOM! Problem solved!\n\nShape into pumpkins and add the stem.\n\nCheck out the full blog post here.\n\n4.

If you have this adorable apple turkey craft ready to go 15 minutes before all the dishes hit the table, your child will still be in their seat. This is the perfect craft to keep small hands busy so the adults can finish up last-minute preparations in the kitchen before and during the time the food is being prepped for the grown-up table.\n\nRachel, a blogger at IHeartCraftyThings.com learned to make these gobbly goodies from her mother during Thanksgiving and now she's sharing them with us.\n\nSupplies\n\nApple\n\nToothpicks\n\nSpice drops\n\nMarshmallow\n\nRaisins\n\nCandy corn\n\nRed fruit snack or red gummy candy, cut in half\n\nDirections\n\nPoke three spice drops onto several toothpicks to make the turkey feathers. Insert the ends of the toothpicks along the back of the apple. If your apple starts to teeter one way you have to counter balance it with more feathers on the other side.\n\nPoke a large marshmallow into another toothpick and poke it into the front of your apple. Fill in your apple turkey\u2019s face by poking in raisins for eyes, a candy corn beak and half of a red fruit snack for the waddle. I used a whole fruit snack for my waddle and then we decided it was too big so we cut the others in half. You decide what you like best.\n\nPoke one spice drop onto the ends of two toothpicks and then insert them into the front of the turkey for the turkey legs and feet.\n\nMORE IDEAS: 9 fun Thanksgiving crafts for kids\n\nMore: How to get your kids involved in cooking Thanksgiving dinner\n\n5.

USA TODAY\n\nLady Gaga used her acceptance speech for Artists Inspiration Award at the Patron of the Artists Awards to advocate for mental health resources. (Photo: Tommaso Boddi, Getty Images)\n\nBEVERLY HILLS \u2014 Lady Gaga pre-empted her speech Thursday night about the need for mental health programs with a warning.\n\n\"I feel very much like I do not belong here,\" the pop star-turned-Oscar-buzzworthy actress said to actors and producers at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation's annual fundraiser Patron Of the Artists Awards, where Spike Lee, Harrison Ford and Jeffrey Katzenberg were also honored.\n\n\"So I spent three-and-a-half hours writing what I was going to say. And as I\u2019ve been sitting here all night, I\u2019ve been going, \u2018Oh my God, your speech is too long and everybody\u2019s going to get bored.\u2019 \"\n\nAt about 20 minutes, the speech was long, yes. But the room of actors was riveted by what Gaga said from the podium about kindness, mental health outreach and her own struggles.\n\n\"We are losing a generation of young people who do not believe that their voices are worth hearing,\" she said, suggesting that SAG-AFTRA partner with Gaga's Born This Way Foundation to provide mental health teams for those suffering. \"The need in this world for kindness is paralyzing. The negative news and tragedies are nonstop and overwhelming.\"\n\nLady Gaga pushing for more mental health programs at #patronawards: \u201cWe are losing a generation of young people who do not believe that their voices are worth hearing.\u201d pic.twitter.com/Oomw49sgQw \u2014 Carly Mallenbaum (@ThatGirlCarly) November 9, 2018\n\nShe referenced the shooting Wednesday night at a California bar that left 13 dead, including the suspected gunman.\n\n\"We need to share our stories so that global mental health no longer resides and festers in the darkness,\" she said. \"It is dangerous and we know this, because amongst other shootings and acts of violence, just last night there was a shooting in Thousand Oaks by a veteran who was believed to have suffered from untreated post-traumatic-stress disorder (according to authorities he had an episode of erratic behavior last spring that suggested PTSD) which is a mental issue. We know that this is dangerous, we know that it\u2019s important and we have to pay attention to it.\"\n\nExperts say the actions of the California bar shooting suspect Ian David Long, 28, a Marine Corps veteran, should not be blamed on PTSD.\n\nLady Gaga continued: \"When I speak about mental health, especially when I\u2019m speaking about mine, it is often met with quietness. Or maybe, a somber line of fans, waiting outside to whisper to me in the shadows about their darkest secrets. We need to bring mental health into the light.\"\n\nAs a way of example, Gaga shared her own \"list\" of issues she's had to deal with.\n\nShe's had \"symptoms of dissociation and PTSD\" which turned into \"physical chronic pain, fibromyalgia, panic attacks, acute trauma responses and debilitating mental spirals that have included suicidal ideation and masochistic behavior.\"\n\nAfter years of saying 'yes' to every job opportunity she was offered, the word 'yes' \"became too automatic, and my inner voice shut down, which I have learned now is very unhealthy,\" she said. \"I was not empowered to say no. I began to notice that I would stare off into space and black out for seconds or minutes. I would see flashes of things I was tormented by, experiences that were filed away.\n\n\"I\u2019m telling you this, because for me it was too late,\" she said. \"I wish I had mental health resources then.\"\n\nThe evening's MC, Rachel Bloom, was so compelled by Gaga's speech that she opened up about her own mental illnesses before closing the show.\n\n\"I, too, suffer from anxiety and depression. I thank God every day for my Prozac. And part of the reason I have treatment is because I can afford it,\" Bloom said. \"I just want to say thank you to Lady Gaga for that speech.\"\n\nMore: 'I wear the pants': Lady Gaga reveals reason behind oversize suit in powerful speech\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/09/lady-gaga-mental-health-patron-awards-sag/1940329002/", "", "", "Notably, while Allure of the Seas is slightly smaller than Symphony of the Seas and Harmony of the Seas, it can hold more passengers.

It boasts three main pool areas, a water slide complex, an adults-only solarium, an ice skating rink, two rock climbing walls, a basketball court and a mall-like indoor promenade with shops, bars and eateries. Like Harmony, it also has an open-air, tree-lined area called Central Park with restaurants, bars and upscale shops such as Bulgari.\n\nSymphony can hold up to 6,680 passengers and sails with a crew of 2,200, meaning that on busy weeks it can be home to nearly 9,000 people.\n\nThe ship was constructed over three years at the giant Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in St. Nazaire, France \u2014 the same shipyard that built Harmony.

Realmuto isn't letting trade rumors become a distraction either at home or in Japan, where he is currently part of an MLB All-Star tour.\n\nMarlins president of baseball operations Michael Hill has dismissed talk about trading Realmuto, but the catcher's agent, Jeff Berry, predicted his client will be with a different team by spring training.\n\n\"It's not a discussion for me to have, honestly,\" Realmuto said Friday. \"It's not my decision whether I get traded or not.

Jefferson Graham reports on #TalkingTech USA TODAY\n\nAmazon's sponsored ads over the best-selling smartwatch from Apple (Photo: screenshot)\n\nDo a search for laptops on Amazon, and the first result might be ones made by Microsoft or HP, despite Asus being Amazon's best seller.\n\nTry for printers, and while HP and Brother top the Amazon best seller chart, the first three (sponsored) results are for a Bluedriver scanner and replacement batteries for printers made by Zebra.\n\nSearching TVs take you directly to LG and Sansui, a company probably most American consumers have never heard of, despite Amazon's best-seller category being dominated by Chinese brand TCL.\n\nThese are sponsored posts, paid by the manufacturer to get better placement on the top e-commerce site, and if you think you're seeing a lot more of these this year, your eyes are not playing tricks on you. There are more ads than ever on top of the products you are searching for, which are ranked based on sales performance and other factors.\n\nKat Eller Murray, a Los Angeles mom with a 14-month-old, shops on Amazon all the time for the baby and tries to tune out the sponsored ads. \"I won\u2019t even look at them because I know they\u2019re sponsored,\u201d she says. \u201cVery rarely are they what I want.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Amazon.com)\n\nAccording to research firm eMarketer, Amazon will bring in $4.6 billion worth of revenue for sponsored ads this year, up from $1.8 billion in 2017. The company is on track to grow these ads to $10.9 billion by 2020. As Amazon enters its busiest season, the holidays, shoppers will be confronted in their searches by products, not the best reviewed or best selling options, but the ones that manufacturers paid for to be the first thing consumers see at the top of the list.\n\nAmazon is \"littered with Sponsored Ads now,\" bemoaned Faisel Masud on Twitter recently. He's the chief operating officer of Wing, a Google company looking to bring autonomous delivery drone service to the public. Writing as a consumer, his post was accompanied with a photo of a 3-star ranked (out of 5 stars) Nerf toy that showed up at the top of his search results. \"Customers need a filter to remove poorly rated items from search results. There has to be a more customer-centric approach here to fix this.\"\n\nAmazon has many ways to filter results, showing you just products that quality for Prime shipping (as part of the $119 yearly expedited shipping and entertainment membership) only ones that have 5 star reviews and more. But cutting out the ads isn't one of your choices.\n\nThe problem for consumers is that manufacturers love the access to Amazon's front page. And as the e-commerce giant, projected to have a 49 percent market share of online transactions by the end of the year, gets bigger, sponsored posts will likely only get more prevalent.\n\n\"Amazon is benefiting from the fact that, on Google and Facebook, consumers may be researching a product, but on Amazon they have the benefit of being at the purchase decision,\" says Monica Peart, an analyst with eMarketer.\n\nJason Goldberg, senior vice-president of commerce for digital marketing firm SapientRazorfish, says manufacturers have little choice \u2013 they have to run sponsored ads on Amazon, due to the size and breadth of the company's customer base. \"No one will find you if you don't pay,\" he says.\n\nFor consumers, it's buyer beware, he adds. Know that the top results are ads, just like on Google and often all over Facebook's News Feed, and try to tune them out. \"You won't find the most popular products or the best reviewed ones there.\" However, once you've identified the product you are interested in, when you click to get more information about it, the ads won't follow you there, he says.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Amazon, but the company declined to comment.\n\nMatt Mickiewicz, the co-founder of Hired.com, vented on Twitter that shopping had become a tougher experience for him on Amazon. \"Between all the sponsored ads, and identical products being sold under 10 different brand names, it\u2019s become a frustrating experience.\"\n\nDon\u2019t companies pay for a specific shelf space in a supermarket as to attract consumers eyes?

But that's phony Republican narrative and Democrats don't have to believe it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nThe Democrats won big in the midterms, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. Between the tedious semantic discussions over whether this was a blue \u201cwave\u201d or \u201cripple\u201d or \u201ctrickle,\u201d and Trump trumpeting this election as a \u201cBig Victory\u201d for himself, one might be forgiven for thinking Democrats lost the 2016 election all over again. We just can\u2019t help being the Eeyores of the political world, seeing only our rotten tail and not the glories of the Hundred Acre Woods.\n\nFor decades, Republicans have been preternaturally deft at controlling the political narrative. They expertly frame arguments that, by their very nature, demean any counter-argument. How America views social safety nets, gun control, and, until recently, health care, is in large part the work of Republicans weaving emotionally-compelling narratives with strong imagery. Think \u201cwelfare queens,\u201d the \u201cgood guy with a gun,\u201d and \u201cdeath panels.\u201d And if the GOP is expert at storytelling, Trump is their Brothers Grimm.\n\nDemocrats scored big gains on many fronts\n\nYes, of course the horrors of American elections \u2014 the rampant voter suppression, a crumbling electoral infrastructure, general Republican corruption, media being media \u2014 became starkly apparent on Tuesday. But for, say, propagandist-in-chief Sean Hannity to call the House wins \u201cmeaningless\u201d is just more phony GOP narrative. This election was actually \u2026 pretty refreshingly predictable.\n\nThe House flipped, the Senate remains Republican-dominated, and there were lots of down-ticket wins for progressive candidates. A record 100-plus women have been elected to Congress, many of them running progressive campaigns in conservative districts. And there have been incredible \"firsts\" for women of color and LGBTQ folks \u2014 perhaps the most stunning of which is the election of Native lesbian Mixed Martial Arts-fighting lawyer Sharice Davids from Kansas.\n\nMore: America is rejecting Trump and protecting democracy\n\nTwo more years of this? Donald Trump spars with media during press conference\n\nFour midterm takeaways, including how Democrats should handle Trump\n\nEven many of the unexpected outcomes worked in Democrats\u2019 favor. Traditionally Republican districts in Texas flipped, due in part to massive progressive mobilization for losing Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. Florida\u2019s Senate and gubernatorial races were ugly, but the state also passed a ballot measure reinstating voting rights for 1.5 million former felons, which will have tremendous impact on the 2020 election. And Michigan, a hotbed of voting controversy in 2016, passed ballot measures to expand voter registration efforts and establish an independent redistricting council.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump refuses to believe he\u2019s not the winner. And in a country that still refers to its first elected leaders as \u201cFounding Fathers,\u201d it\u2019s really hard to let go of the President Dad narrative. Can Father be wrong? How can Democrats be the winners when Trump says he\u2019s the winner?\n\nWe don't have to listen to 'President Dad'\n\nThis is precisely why young adults are so important to the political landscape right now \u2014 they are rebelling against their parents in real time, and they\u2019re teaching us how to do the same. If anyone can change the narrative and teach America that we don\u2019t have to listen to Dad, it\u2019s teenagers.\n\nDemocrats have to realize that there is no going back to the heady days of 2009, after Barack Obama's victory, when we unironically said things like \u201cpost-racial.\u201d If Democrats were expecting Trump to pack up his toys and go home after this election, then we haven\u2019t grasped the enormity of this fight. We must celebrate our victories and figure out, quickly, what to fight for next.\n\nMight I suggest: riding this wave of enthusiasm for voting rights and investigations into voter suppression, fixing gerrymandered districts, and making sure these new blue-state public servants actually follow through on their promises. But most of all: it\u2019s time to finally flip the script in our own minds.

(AP) \u2014 At 43, Baylor coach Matt Rhule is far removed from a playing career. That doesn't mean he won't run the gauntlet with his guys to prove a point.\n\nWhen Rhule was helping turn around the program at Temple, he already had many of his players outfitted with XTECH shoulder pads, a revolutionary protective device that is gaining traction on all levels of football.\n\n\"I even wore the XTECH pads and went through bull-in-the-ring while I was at Temple,\" he recalls, \"and I can tell you that the next day I felt less sore than I should have felt.\"\n\nThat's the refrain from many a player, including NFL stars such as Khalil Mack, Matt Ryan, Odell Beckham Jr., and Andrew Luck \u2014 who missed an entire season because of shoulder issues.\n\n\"I had a unique history after being at the New York Giants where several players wore the XTECH pads ,\" says Rhule, who left Temple for Baylor in 2016. \"Then Muhammad Wilkerson, who played for me at Temple, was a proponent of the pads. I had a chance to see them work firsthand. When we went to Temple, we put them on several guys, and they all had positive reviews. Shoulder injuries went down. Upon coming to Baylor, we had a chance to implement the same thing. We've watched our occurrence of injuries and postseason surgeries come down subsequently.\n\n\"The pads have been shown to work at a high level, and we have had tremendous personal success with them. The vast majority of our players have enjoyed the pads and appreciated the commitment to their health and welfare. I've even had other coaches reach out to me over the years to ask about them.\"\n\nThat seems to be the reaction from high schools \u2014 famed Mater Dei in Santa Ana, California, originally bought three sets and now the entire team is wearing XTECH \u2014 to college, where company co-founder Bob Broderick says close to 500 schools across all levels have players suiting up in the pads, with virtually the entire Washington State roster using them.\n\nDozens of players at the likes of Michigan, Penn State, Syracuse, Mississippi and Notre Dame use the pads.\n\nAs for the pros \u2014 the NFL does not survey shoulder pads as it does helmets \u2014 Patriots running back James White, in the midst of the finest season of his five-year career, says: \"I like that the pads are light and give me a lot of range to move my arms. But at the same time, they give me all the protection my shoulders need. I've always given thought to my shoulder pads because as a person who runs and catches the football, I feel like you should have the right pads to help you get your job done.\"\n\nXTECH has been on the job for six years, though the work staff is small: 11 full-timers, seven part-timers. That could be increased as Broderick and co-founder Ted Monica break into the European market; there are distribution deals in place for January to expand in Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Also next year, XTECH will make available its first five-padded girdle; most states require all high school football players to wear a five-padded girdle.\n\nTheir Cover-2 Program works with NFL teams, current and former coaches and players to buy pads and donate them back to their high schools. Zach Ertz, Melvin Gordon and the McCourty brothers have done so, and the Giants donated equipment to the New York Police Department's football squad.\n\nMonica has worked in the football equipment world for nearly 38 years. He custom designs every pad, which Broderick says are the only pads made entirely in the United States.\n\nWhat makes those pads stand out?\n\nThe patented design features the only dual-cantilever system on the market, an adjustable three-piece body system that allows each pad to fit the player's body at the proper angle while creating a natural channel for the AC joint to sit in. On the performance side, a three-point swivel system allows for enhanced range of motion, and air flow occurs into the front and back to work in conjunction with uniforms, allowing for maximum ventilation.\n\nAdditionally, XTECH uses XRD Technology, which is well known in the military space and is the foam XTECH uses in the entire pad. XRD, a division of Rogers Corporation, has a multi-year exclusive partnership with XTECH for American football. Monica calls it \"smart foam,\" which is water resistant as well as highly protective and durable.\n\nThe majority of the shoulder pad industry uses foam from China and an \"air management\" system which was developed in the 1970s. Think of a pillow and every time you hit it air goes out the side, and it compresses down and is therefore less protective for the subsequent hit.\n\nAccording to many of the players using XTech's pads, that's never been a concern.\n\nRecent company addition Brooks Barnard is the vice president of sales and left Under Armour after 12 years overseeing its high school properties to join XTECH. He was attracted by XTech's implementing \"an idea that was disruptive and challenged a predictable way of thinking.\"\n\n\"As I spent time in locker rooms across the country, I noticed the XTECH brand growing in popularity with elite athletes as their choice of pads to wear on Friday nights,\" he says. \"The design of XTECH naturally captures your attention and automatically engages any football mind. It was evident that XTECH was sought by top players at the NFL and NCAA level and a groundswell was happening at the high school level. Several of the nationally ranked programs in the country already had players in XTECH and I witnessed first-hand what top recruits were saying about the pad.\"\n\nIf anyone needs a reliable shoulder pad, naturally it is Luck. The first overall selection in the 2012 draft and the Colts' franchise QB since then never suited up in 2017. He's back now and having a strong season despite a general dearth of talent around him.\n\nLuck is intrigued by technology, but his reasons for switching to XTECH appear simpler.\n\n\"Just a little lighter,\" Luck says. \"Been wearing the same shoulder pads and thought I'd try a new one out. It didn't come from a place that I need something different, I need more protection. It was just some new technology that our equipment managers came to me about and it's worked well so far.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Lt. Nani Cholakians of the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's Office said late Friday that law enforcement notified the agency of two bodies that were possibly related to the fire.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed the death investigation early Saturday. Authorities said the bodies were found at 4:43 p.m. Friday in the 33000 block of Mulholland Highway.

Four others died at undisclosed locations.\n\nOnly one of the nine people who died was found inside a home. Butte County Sheriff Korey Honea said that three people were found outside homes and four people inside vehicles. He said another victim was found near a vehicle but outside it.\n\nAll the victims were found in Paradise, which was evacuated as a result of the fire.\n\nAuthorities say they conducted numerous rescues Friday as they fought the flames, including using helicopters to rescue five people in the nearby community of Magalia.\n\nThe sheriff says they have taken 35 reports of missing people and that the number is likely to grow.\n\nSeveral of the victims were found in the same area of the devastated retirement community that also lost some 2,000 structures.

The 24th-ranked Spartans will be at home, and they still have a lot to play for themselves.\n\n\"Very strong rivalry,\" Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said. \"We have a lot of respect for that team.\"\n\nThe rivalry with Michigan can wait: Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr. was apparently willing to solicit help from Wolverines QB Shea Patterson while preparing for this matchup with Michigan State.

A win over the Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1, No. 10) would do wonders.\n\n\"Once we kind of get toward the end of the season, and you start seeing the bowl predictions,\" Spartans quarterback Brian Lewerke said. \"All that we can do now, now that we're in bowl position, is just win out and try to win as many games as we can, just keep trying to get to a better and better bowl for us.\"\n\nHere are a few things to know before the Spartans host the Buckeyes:\n\nHISTORY\n\nMichigan State beat Ohio State en route to Big Ten titles in 2013 and 2015, but the Buckeyes won a key matchup against the Spartans in 2014 and went on to win the national title.\n\nAs competitive as Michigan State has been with Meyer's Buckeyes, the Spartans have lost their last six home games in this series.\n\nBACKING HIS MAN\n\nLewerke has started most of the season at quarterback for Michigan State, but he's dealt with an injured shoulder recently, and Rocky Lombardi has done some good things in relief. Spartans coach Mark Dantonio tried to put some of the uncertainty to rest this week.\n\n\"Brian is our starting quarterback, I think you can go with that,\" Dantonio said. \"Is he 100 percent? Nobody is ever 100 percent 10 games into the season, but if he could not play, he would not play.\"\n\nON THE RUN\n\nMichigan State has the nation's top-ranked run defense, but Ohio State isn't likely to be intimidated. The Buckeyes ran for 335 yards in last season's blowout. J.K. Dobbins and Mike Weber combined for 254 yards on the ground in a win over Nebraska last weekend.\n\nBIG GAMES\n\nThe Spartans are 10-6 in their last 16 games against teams in the AP top 10, including a win over No. 8 Penn State earlier this season. Ohio State was ranked No. 2 when it lost to Michigan State in 2013 and 2015.\n\nON A ROLL\n\nHaskins may not need much help from Patterson or anyone else.

But both teams slog into this at 3-6, needing to win out to become bowl eligible. Kansas has already said coach David Beaty won't return after this season. What about K-State coach Bill Snyder? The 79-year-old Hall of Famer signed a contract extension before the season, but that seemed more symbolic than anything else. There is mounting sentiment that it is time the program moved in a new direction, but Snyder doesn't seem to want to budge. Losing to the Jayhawks might change that dynamic in Manhattan.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Mayweather said he has signed to fight Nasukawa for a bout promoted by Japan's RIZIN Fighting Federation on Dec. 31 in Saitama, north of Tokyo. (Katsuya Miyagawa/Kyodo News via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nIt looked like easy money, and there's no one more qualified to judge that then the founder and titular head of The Money Team.\n\nBut sometimes chasing a pile of cash is more difficult than it seems.\n\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. found that out when he went looking for money in Japan. The deal, or so he thought, was to perform a three-round exhibition before what he said was a small group of wealthy spectators for \"a very large fee.\"\n\nTurns out Mayweather got hoodwinked. And then he quickly got out of town.\n\nHe wanted no part of a rising young Japanese kickboxing star, even though he outweighed Tenshin Nasukawa by 30 pounds. A guy could get hurt in a real fight, especially if the rules weren't all in his favor.\n\nThe problem was, Mayweather had appeared at a press conference Monday in Tokyo in which the fight was announced. He posed for pictures with Nasukawa, and talked about how their New Year's Eve bout would be an epic event.\n\nSo he had to backpedal. And fast.\n\nMayweather said he was blindsided by promoters at the press conference and went along when they said the fight was scheduled, with the rules to be figured out later. He said he didn't even know who Nasukawa was.\n\nFair enough. But Google is available in Japan, and it didn't take Mayweather long to find out a few things about his opponent.\n\nOr maybe he just read an Instagram post from Joe Rogan, the UFC fight announcer who knew a little more about Nasukawa.\n\n\"He's a true striking genius,\" Rogan said of the 20-year-old. \"I doubt Floyd is going to agree to any rules that allow Tenshin to kick, but if he does, it could be a terrible night for him. This kid is the truth.\"\n\nWhatever it was, Mayweather left Japan as fast as he could.\n\nAnd, really, who could blame Mayweather. He's made a career \u2014 and made himself immensely wealthy \u2014 out of picking just the right opponent at the right time and this wasn't the opponent or the time to get back in the ring.\n\nBut in doing so he may have damaged his brand, if just a bit. Mayweather doesn't do contrition well, but contrite he was in a lengthy post that didn't exactly cast him in a favorable light.\n\n\"I am a retired boxer that earns an unprecedented amount of money, globally, for appearances, speaking engagements and occasional small exhibitions,\" Mayweather wrote.\n\nIf that's so, then perhaps Manny Pacquiao better go looking for another opponent for his next fight. Actually, Pacquiao already has, with plans to fight Adrien Broner in January.\n\nStill there's a good chance the two could meet in May in Las Vegas in a rematch of their first fight. By then they might have made enough boxing fans forget what a snoozer the first fight was to pay big money for a rematch between two 40-something boxers.\n\nWith Mayweather, it's anyone's guess. He already announced the Pacquiao fight for December, you might remember, though it will not happen then.\n\nAnd now he claims he's just an old retired boxer trying to make a little spending money by giving speeches and small exhibitions.\n\nWho's going to pay big money to see that?\n\nIt's hard to argue with what Mayweather has done in a career more spectacular for the amount of money he's made than the epic fights he's been in. He turned himself into a marketing phenomenon beginning with his 2007 fight with Oscar De La Hoya, and has made more money than even he can count.\n\nHe also conned people into believing his fight with UFC fighter Conor McGregor was a legitimate match, before easily dispatching him in his last lucrative exhibition.\n\nBut the Mayweather brand is getting old, and so is his appeal. He's reduced to being the \"opponent\" in fights like the one he was planning in Japan and even his sycophants have to be getting the idea by now that they're being played.\n\nA second fight with Pacquiao holds little intrigue after the dull affair the two put on in 2015. Like the proposed fight in Japan it's strictly a money grab by the founder of The Money Team.\n\nIn the end, Mayweather couldn't run fast enough from a young opponent in Japan.\n\nWe should all think about running if his next press conference is to announce a fight with Pacquiao.\n\n____\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

In 2014, then-Capitals forward Joel Ward was also the subject of racial social media posts after he scored a game-winning playoff goal. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Devante Smith-Pelly got up from his seat.\n\nThe Washington Capitals forward had heard the unmistakably racist taunts from fans from inside the penalty box. As a black hockey player, he knew exactly what they meant by yelling, \"Basketball, basketball, basketball!\"\n\n\"It's just ignorant people being ignorant,\" Smith-Pelly said.\n\nThat scene unfolded in Chicago in February, 60 years after Willie O'Ree broke the NHL's color barrier and paved the way for more minorities to play the sport and reach its highest level. O'Ree is being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on Monday for his pioneering career, and yet incidents like the one Smith-Pelly went through show how much more progress needs to be made, in a league that's 97 percent white and beyond.\n\n\"It's come a long way, but there's still a lot of things that still need to change,\" Edmonton defenseman Darnell Nurse said. \"That just comes through minorities as a group working together to try to eliminate those things from this game.\"\n\nThose things just keep happening.\n\nIn 2011, Philadelphia forward Wayne Simmonds had a banana thrown at him during a preseason game in London, Ontario.\n\nIn 2012, then-Washington forward Joel Ward was the subject of racist social media posts after he scored a game-winning playoff goal.\n\nIn 2014, then-Montreal defenseman P.K. Subban was the subject of racist social media posts after he scored a game-winning playoff goal.\n\nIn April, Detroit prospect Givani Smith was subjected to threats and racial taunts and messages after a junior game in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. His team had a police escort the next time they went to the rink.\n\n\"(O'Ree) had to go through a lot, and the same thing has been happening now, which obviously means there's still a long way to go,\" Smith-Pelly said. \"If you had pulled a quote from him back then and us now, they're saying the same thing, so obviously there's still a long way to go in hockey and in the world if we're being serious.\"\n\nThrough his work as an NHL diversity ambassador over the past 20 years, O'Ree has tried to work toward more inclusion and better minority representation. He is eager to tell kids at YMCAs, Boys & Girls Clubs and schools that hockey is another sport they can play.\n\nUSA Hockey and Hockey Canada don't keep participation statistics by race, though there are fewer than two dozen black players currently on NHL rosters. The NHL celebrates \"Hockey is for Everyone\" month each season and quickly condemns racist behavior.\n\n\"A lot of it's basically on your parents and how people raise their kids,\" said San Jose forward Evander Kane, who acknowledged being the subject of racist taunting as the only black player on his minor league teams in Vancouver. \"You can have all the awareness that you want, but at the end of the day, it's really up to the individual and how they act and how they want to treat other people.\"\n\nO'Ree, 83, still remembers how he was treated in the '50s as hockey's Jackie Robinson. He did his best to drown out the noise by listening to his brother Richard.\n\n\"I heard the jeers and some of the racial remarks, but it kind of went in one ear and out the other,\" O'Ree said. \"He told me, 'Willie, names will never hurt you unless you let them.' He said, 'If they can't accept you for the individual that you are, just forget about it and just go out and do what you do best and don't worry about anything else.'\"\n\nNurse said black players still have to worry about racist jeers and remarks.\n\n\"I had a lot growing up and my brother had the big one too last year,\" said Dallas forward Gemel Smith, Givani's brother. \"How we were raised, nothing really bothers me. That stuff doesn't really get to me and things like that. My dad always taught us just to try to close it out, block it out.\"\n\nLike Smith-Pelly, Simmonds is quick to say racism isn't an issue unique to hockey or sports in general. His solution is a zero tolerance policy, which is what happened to the four fans in Chicago who were thrown out and banned from all home games by the Blackhawks.\n\n\"I think what could be done to keep these types of incidents from happening would probably be to ban those people who are doing those lewd acts,\" Simmonds said. \"I think if you set a strong example right from the start, you won't have too many people acting like clowns.\"\n\nCommissioner Gary Bettman, who is going into the Hall of Fame with O'Ree as part of the class of 2018, considers it important to make clear to fans and players what's expected and what's not tolerated and said: \"Even if it's only one incident, it's one too many.\" Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said creating and cultivating an inclusive environment and building diversity are significant league priorities.\n\nThere has been incremental progress. In the aftermath of Smith-Pelly's incident, fans in Chicago raised $23,000 to donate to the Fort Dupont Ice Rink in Washington, helping hundreds of children.\n\n\"When you see the reaction and the way that people rally around moments like that and try to make a positive out of it, I think that's definitely a step in the right direction,\" Nurse said.\n\nFor some players like Seth Jones, the son of former NBA player Popeye Jones, hockey has been a safe place. The Blue Jackets defenseman said he has so far never been on the receiving end of race-based taunts or messages and said, \"I was just like everybody else playing hockey, which is what everyone wants.\"\n\nMost black players haven't been that fortunate. And while Jones is optimistic that people can change, Smith-Pelly wasn't sure exactly how that will happen.\n\n\"It's tough,\" he said. \"I don't really know a plan to stop it. That's how people are.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The top teams are very exciting and there are plenty of high-scoring games,\" said Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports who now runs his own sports television consulting company.\n\nPilson said a major ratings driver has been the emergence of young quarterbacks like the Rams' Jared Goff, the Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and the Bears' Mitchell Trubisky. That has created a buzz not only with their teams but throughout the league.\n\nAnother factor is that player protests against social and racial injustice during the national anthem have not been a major storyline this season. Pilson noted that \"a few of those folks who said they were going to stop watching I don't know how many did.\"\n\nNBC's \"Sunday Night Football\" package has shown the biggest improvement with an 8 percent increase from last season. It is averaging 19.7 million viewers, compared to 18.3 million last season.\n\nThis past Sunday's game between the Green Bay Packers and New England Patriots averaged a league-high 23.7 million, and was the largest prime-time audience on any network since ABC aired the Academy Awards in March.

Pilson has been critical of scheduling for Thursday and Monday nights in past seasons, but he said the league has made improvements in those areas.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, because the roster move has not been announced. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Dez Bryant wasn't about to declare himself a changed man just because he'd changed teams.\n\nAt age 30, the ninth-year NFL veteran receiver said he is comfortable with who he always has been and hopes he'll fit in with the New Orleans Saints, a team on a seven-game winning streak that looks like it's all-in to contend for a Super Bowl this season.\n\n\"I'm always going to be me, you know, who I am. I'm not a bad guy. I've always been a good guy,\" Bryant said after his first practice with New Orleans on Thursday afternoon. \"You can ask my teammates \u2014 my ex-teammates \u2014 how I am. I love the locker room. It's like family. Every locker room that I've been in \u2014 from middle school, high school, college, to the pros \u2014 it's always been like a family.\"\n\nBryant was reticent when asked to go into detail about interest shown in him by other clubs. He is known to have met with Cleveland and Baltimore before his workout with New Orleans this week earned him a spot on a Saints offense that currently ranks seventh in the NFL and is led by the NFL's all-time leader in completions and yards passing.\n\n\"Who wouldn't want to play with Drew Brees,\" said Bryant, who caught passes from Brees at practice on Thursday. \"Not taking away from nobody else, but you got a guy like Drew Brees, like I said, you got a guy like Michael Thomas, (Ben) Watson, Alvin Kamara, Mark Ingram. You got those types of guys.\"\n\nBryant spent his first eight NFL seasons with Dallas and in 2017 caught 69 passes for 838 yards and six touchdowns, including a 50-yard scoring play, for the Cowboys.\n\nHowever, his professional reputation has been marred at times by public confrontations with coaches and teammates during games and practices.\n\nLast season was Bryant's best since he caught 88 passes for 1,320 yards and 16 TDs in 2014, which at the time was his third consecutive season with at least 1,200 yards receiving. He signed his last Cowboys contract right after that, but has not approached that level of production since \u2014 a central reason Dallas released him in April with two years left on his five-year, $70 million contract.\n\nSaints players sounded eager to see how Bryant might help.\n\nThomas, who is New Orleans' leading receiver, said he has been following Bryant's career.\n\n\"He's definitely one of those guys you have to watch if you're playing the receiver position,\" Thomas said. \"He's a guy who's done some great things at the position, so you just have to respect it and pick his brain. I asked him a lot of questions, and it's just cool to play with a guy like that.\"\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton said Thursday that Bryant would be taking the spot on the active roster vacated by receiver Cameron Meredith, a free-agent signing last offseason who is coming back from a major knee injury, and who went on injured reserve after he and the club agreed he'd benefit from undergoing an arthroscopic cleanup on that same knee.\n\n\"He kept having the swelling week in and week out and he really was pushing through it,\" Payton said.\n\nReceiver Ted Ginn Jr. also is on injured reserve and cannot come back until the final few weeks of the regular season, if he's ready by then.\n\nIt's not clear how soon Bryant will have a regular role in New Orleans' offense. Payton said Bryant is perhaps five pounds heavier than his ideal playing weight, which would be common among players who did not go through a training camp.\n\nBut Payton added, \"we felt like he did a number of things that we liked in the workout.\"\n\nThe signing sets the stage for Bryant to play in Dallas when the Saints visit the Cowboys for a Thursday night game on Nov. 29.\n\n\"I am going to be excited. I'll get to see all the Cowboys fans. You know I still love those guys. I love my ex-teammates. They're my family,\" Bryant said. \"But I'm here on a new chapter. It's going to be fun, but I'm the opponent now.\"\n\nBryant said he is \"not at all\" bitter about his departure from the Cowboys, adding, \"That chapter's closed. That's something I had to accept.

The jerseys will be similar to those worn in 1923, the year the stadium opened, and the helmet design gives a nod to the leather helmets of yesteryear.\n\nWORKING FAST\n\nIllinois has 16 scoring drives of less than a minute, third-most in the FBS behind Alabama and Utah State and tied with Clemson. Twelve of the 16 drives have come against Big Ten competition, including three last week against Minnesota. In 2017, the Illini had four such drives all season.\n\nILLINI STRUGGLE IN LINCOLN\n\nIllinois has lost eight of nine games in Lincoln, including four straight since a 9-6 win in 1924.

It would be a milestone for the Bears, who lost 17 of 19 at one point as the program rebuilds under second-year coach Matt Rhule following a campus sex assault scandal.\n\n\"They played four quarters and that was our goal,\" Rhule said. \"It wasn't always perfect.

(Photo: Jim Lo/epa-EFE)\n\nWhat do this week\u2019s election results mean for the deficit, national debt, government spending and fiscal melodrama in Washington? There\u2019s going to be much more of each one.\n\nThe House under Democratic control and the Senate with a larger Republican majority means that an already a difficult federal budget situation will be even more difficult in the next Congress. Add in a Trump White House in reelection mode, and the federal budget outlook is clearly much worse.\n\nThere are five reasons.\n\nFirst, if there are no changes and federal spending and revenues are left on autopilot because there\u2019s a stalemate among the House, Senate and White House, the budget deficit will balloon to more than $1 trillion a year \u2026 and stay there. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit will be at or well above that level for every year through at least 2028.\n\nBudget agreements might increase deficit\n\nSecond, to the extent there are any budget-related agreements between House Democrats and Senate Republicans over the next two years, they are likely to be on things that will increase the deficit even further. The new Republican Senate and Democratic House will each demand that their spending preferences be accommodated before they will agree to support what the other wants. The result could either be that nothing gets added to the already soaring deficit outlook, or they pile on billions more.\n\nThird, fiscal transparency and accountability will take a big hit because Congress will now be even less likely to adopt a budget. Even though it is required by law to do so, the House and Senate will have such different spending and taxing agendas that finding a compromise that can pass both chambers will be a long shot at best. In addition, having no budget will mean every Republican and Democrat will be able to avoid voting in favor of those trillion-dollar-plus deficits and their leaders won\u2019t have to beg them to do so.\n\nMore: Trump trillion-dollar-plus deficits are putting America on a path to fiscal ruin\n\nElection results 2018: Forget the blue wave and behold the purple puddle\n\nElection results 2018: Bragging rights for everybody and nobody\n\nFourth, the drama surrounding the budget will increase exponentially with appropriations fights, potential and actual government shutdowns and debt ceiling showdowns now even more likely than they were before as Senate Republicans, House Democrats and the Trump White House all jockey for position and maneuver for leverage on a variety of issues. As a result, getting all 12 appropriations bills enacted by the start of the fiscal year (Oct. 1 of each calendar year) will now be even less probable than it has been in recent years.\n\nFifth, Trump will have far less incentive to compromise with Congress on spending and taxing issues than he did before. For example, he previously was willing to delay until after the election his demand for funding for a wall between the United States and Mexico because GOP leaders asked. But departing Republican Speaker Paul Ryan looks likely to be replaced by Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom Trump and the Republicans demonized throughout the campaign. That won't be as easy or desirable (and may not be as politically acceptable) for the White House as dealing with Ryan.\n\nTrump may prefer confrontation to compromise\n\nWhat makes all this worse is that it\u2019s hard to see this dismal federal budget outlook improving over the next few years. Not only will there be no imperative for Congress and Trump to reduce the deficit, it\u2019s far more likely that, if anything, they will increase it further.\n\nIf an economic downturn occurs, the House, Senate and White House will be racing to be the first to propose spending increases and tax reductions to deal with it. And it\u2019s virtually impossible to imagine that either side would accept the one budget deal that would make a serious dent in the deficit \u2014 where House Democrats agree to cut Social Security and Medicare in exchange for Senate Republicans agreeing to corporate tax increases and military reductions.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether Trump, as he moves increasingly into reelection mode over the next two years, will be more interested in confrontation than compromise with House Democrats on anything.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be brutal two years.\n\nStan Collender, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, teaches federal budgeting at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and is the founder of thebudgetguy.blog.

Canada faces an uncertain future, despite keeping the football team together and forging a winning record amid the chaos surrounding the program.(AP Photo/Gary Cameron, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe glaring numbers put everything in perspective this weekend.\n\nIndiana coach Tom Allen and Maryland interim coach Matt Canada know their teams desperately need momentum heading into the season's final month and understand how crucial the outcome of Saturday's game could be.\n\nThe winner could be bowl-bound. The loser may be relegated to a longer-than-expected offseason and both coaches know it, even if they choose to downplay the significance of how everything adds up in this game.\n\n\"It's an opportunity for us come to out here and turn things around for our season, get a whole different feel for our program,\" Allen said as his Hoosiers returned to work following a bye week.\n\nNeither Allen nor Canada planned on spending November crunching probabilities. But previous results left them no choice.\n\nIndiana (4-5, 1-5 Big Ten) has lost four consecutive games and still needs two wins to become bowl-eligible with a trip to No. 4 Michigan next weekend looming. The Hoosiers haven't won at Ann Arbor since 1967, meaning their most logical path to the postseason would be winning their final two home games \u2014 against Maryland (5-4, 3-3) and bitter rival Purdue (5-4, 4-2), which could be playing for the West Division title.\n\nWith No. 8 Ohio State coming to town next week and a trip to No. 21 Penn State to close out the season, Maryland's best shot of earning that crucial sixth win appears to be winning Saturday.\n\nBut the Terrapins' only road win this season came at Mid-American Conference foe Bowling Green and all four losses have come by at least 21 points.\n\nThe implications of leading Maryland to its second bowl game in four years could add up to an even bigger reward for Canada, who has held together a team grieving from the death of offensive lineman Jordan McNair, last week's firing of coach DJ Durkin and this week's dismissal of two trainers involved in treating McNair after he collapsed during a May workout.\n\nCanada never has made it about him.\n\n\"We have three games in the next 18 days, so our focus is on today,\" he said. \"It's focused on getting ready to beat Indiana and being around each other. That's all we can do right now.\"\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nKeep an eye on the turnovers Saturday. Maryland leads the country with 16 interceptions and the Big Ten in turnover margin (plus-9). It is the only conference team with at least one pick in every game. Indiana, meanwhile, has a league-high 20 takeaways, including a league-leading 10 fumble recoveries. The Hoosiers also are No. 24 nationally with 10 interceptions.\n\nMOVING ON UP\n\nPeyton Ramsey's season certainly looks good on paper. He heads into this weekend with a completion percentage of 68.2, which would be the best in school history. Ramsey needs 20 completions to move into the top five on Indiana's single-season list and 23 pass attempts, 135 total yards and 377 yards passing to crack the top 10. He's already in the top 10 for TD passes in a season and needs three more to pass Antwaan Randle El and Ben Chappell for No. 7.\n\nREADY TO RUN\n\nLast week, the Terrapins played without injured running backs Ty Johnson and Jake Funk. Both hope to return this weekend. Johnson hurt his calf against Illinois on Oct. 27 and ranks third in school history with 4,158 all-purpose yards and fourth all-time in yards rushing with 2,597. Canada said he would be a game-time decision. Funk hasn't played since the opener against Texas because of a broken hand. He scored five touchdowns last year \u2014 two against Indiana \u2014 and was the named the Terrapins special teams player of the year. Canada said Funk was cleared to play last week.\n\nHOOSIER TIES\n\nCanada grew up in central Indiana, earned his degree at Indiana University in 1993 and got his coaching start with the Hoosiers as a graduate assistant in 1994 and 1995 under the late Bill Mallory. He returned in 2004 as Indiana's quarterbacks coach, spent 2005 and 2006 as the passing game coordinator and then became Bill Lynch's offensive coordinator from 2007-10. It's unclear if one of Maryland's famous alums will make the drive to Memorial Stadium. Colts coach Frank Reich is best remembered for throwing six second-half TD passes in relief to lead the Terrapins back from a 31-point deficit to beat Miami 42-40 in 1984. It's still the third-largest comeback in FBS history.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer David Ginsburg in Baltimore contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But he says his team still must develop the kind of habits that elite teams possess.\n\n\"There's a mentality that goes with things like that that I think we have to learn,\" Fisher said. \"I'm not disappointed as far as the way their effort is. It's just that we have to keep learning, we have to keep teaching in what we're doing ... there's another level mentality-wise and psychological disposition that we have to understand and be comfortable at.\"\n\nTexas A&M will face an Ole Miss team looking to snap a skid. The Rebels (5-4, 1-4) enter the game after dropping their last two. Ole Miss led by 3 entering the fourth quarter last week against South Carolina before falling 48-44.\n\n\"It's the attention to detail that gets us over the hump,\" coach Matt Luke said. \"I think those guys understand that. They're not happy about losing, and they're hurting. If you want to win games in this league, the attention to detail has to be there. We can't give up explosive plays. We can't turn the ball over in the red zone. We've got to do the little things it takes to win in this league.\"\n\nTA'AMU's HEALTH\n\nMississippi quarterback Jordan Ta'amu, who leads the SEC in yards passing, was limited in practice this week after hurting his foot against the Gamecocks. Offensive coordinator Phil Longo said he should be ready to go on Saturday. If things change and he can't play against the Aggies, the Rebels will look to true freshman Matt Corral, who has appeared in three games this season.\n\n\"If we need him, Matt's the guy, but I think Jordan is going to be fine,\" Luke said.\n\nSTANDING BY MOND\n\nFisher was asked if he was behind quarterback Kellen Mond after the sophomore threw an interception and lost a fumble in last week's loss.\n\n\"One-thousand percent,\" Fisher said. He then added that many factors played into his tough performance against South Carolina.\n\n\"We all get caught up in looking at the guy with the ball and not the cause of the play,\" Fisher said. \"You look at why things are and there are about four or five plays in the game you wish he'd done better ... was he perfect? No. Was it his best game? No. But by far (he) was not the (only) reason why any of that happened.\"\n\nMond has thrown for 2,252 yards with 12 touchdowns and seven interceptions and has rushed for 288 yards and four more scores.\n\nCLOSING IN\n\nMississippi receiver A.J. Brown needs just 63 yards to become the school's all-time leading receiver. He has 920 yards receiving this season to give him 2,584 and put him in third place in school history and within striking distance of the school's leading receiver Shay Hodge, who piled up 2,646 yards receiving from 2006-09. Brown, who is projected to be a top-10 pick in next year's draft, has four 100-yard receiving games this season and has scored five touchdowns.\n\nON THE GROUND\n\nWhile Mond has had an inconsistent season, the Aggies have gotten steady production from running back Trayveon Williams, who ranks second in the SEC with 931 yards rushing. He ran for 107 yards and two touchdowns last week for his fifth 100-yard rushing game of the season and 10th of his career. His work against South Carolina helped the Aggies finish with 220 yards rushing, which were their most against an SEC opponent this season.\n\n\"They are very explosive in the run game, and I think that's where we'll have to start,\" Luke said. \"We have a game plan for us to stop the run and then make them beat us throwing the football.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Michael Woods) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Missouri had been lacking a signature win in quarterback Drew Lock's final season, losing late on the road against South Carolina and two weeks ago to Kentucky.\n\nThe moment finally came last week on the road against No. 11 Florida, when the Tigers seemed to put everything together for the first time in a 38-17 rout \u2014 coach Barry Odom's first win over a ranked team.\n\n\"You're going to be faced with adversity. You're going to be faced with hard times,\" Odom said afterward. \"This game was decided long before the ball was kicked off.\"\n\nThe Tigers (5-4, 1-4 SEC) hope to take the same approach into Saturday's game against Vanderbilt. Missouri can become bowl-eligible by beating the Commodores (4-5, 1-4), then build its resume with a favorable finishing stretch. The Tigers get Tennessee and Arkansas to finish out the season.\n\nVanderbilt is fighting for bowl eligibility, too. The Commodores follow their trip to Columbia with home games against Ole Miss and Tennessee.\n\n\"I just want one win,\" Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \"Let's talk about that. We've got to talk about today, and that's exactly what I did with my football team.\"\n\nSenior center Bruno Reagan knows well what happens if Vandy wins at least two of its final three.\n\n\"I heavily desire to play in December,\" he said. \"I want to play postseason football. I want to do a lot of things. I want to go out of here with a bowl win. That's what these seniors deserve.\"\n\nAfter losing three straight, the Commodores got back on track with a 45-31 win at Arkansas as Ke'Shawn Vaughn ran for 172 yards and three touchdowns. He will face a Missouri defense that ranks 25th nationally and allows just 125 yards rushing per game.\n\nThe Commodores also must contain a Tigers offense that piled up 471 yards on Florida.\n\n\"I think this football team coached by Barry Odom is as hot of a football team, as talented of a football team as there is out there,\" Mason said.\n\nVETERAN QUARTERBACKS\n\nBoth guys under center \u2014 Lock for the Tigers, Kyle Shurmur for the Commodores \u2014 have started in all four years at their respective schools. Shurmur ranks third on the Commodores' career passing list with 7,772 yards. Lock has 11,089 yards and needs just 65 more to move into fifth place on the SEC's career list.\n\n\"I feel like (Shurmur) and I played against each other,\" joked Odom, who played linebacker for the Tigers from 1996-99.\n\nHALL OF A RETURN\n\nMissouri senior wide receiver Emanuel Hall took the field last week after missing four games with a groin injury and coping with the loss of his father. He caught four passes for 77 yards and a touchdown, igniting the Tigers in their blowout win over the Gators.\n\n\"You wouldn't write that script for a guy to have his senior year,\" Odom said. \"He's continued to stay in there and battle every day. And he's battled some off-the-field things very admirably.\"\n\nTHIN AT SAFETY\n\nThe Commodores could be without a pair of safeties. LaDarius Wiley's father died late last week, and Mason said the safety will rejoin the team when possible, even as late as Saturday. Zaire Jones has been suspended indefinitely for violating the student conduct policy. Mason said Jones will miss the rest of this season. Wiley has started every game this season Commodores' second leading tackler. Jones has started once and has 13 tackles.\n\nHE'S EVERYWHERE\n\nVanderbilt linebacker Jordan Griffin leads the team with 46 solo tackles and 91 total tackles. The senior's total puts Griffin second in the SEC behind Arkansas' De'Jon Harris, who has 93 heading into Saturday.\n\nTURNOVER-FREE\n\nEarlier in the season, Missouri couldn't avoid its own mistakes in turning the ball over.

Reid was ejected after the play. (AP Photo/Don Wright) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The Carolina Panthers fell behind early and never recovered.\n\nBen Roethlisberger and the Steelers offense used an early surge and a first-quarter defensive touchdown to jump out to a big lead as the Steelers pounded the Panthers 52-21 on Thursday night for their fifth straight victory.\n\n\"I tell you what, it sure enough was a humbling piece of pie,\" Panthers quarterback Cam Newton said. \"It was a learning experience for a lot of guys. If we are as good as we expect us to be, we have to find a way to win games in a hostile environment.\"\n\nThe Panthers (6-3) saw their three-game winning streak come to an abrupt halt in a city where they've never won. Carolina fell to 0-4 all-time in Pittsburgh and was never really in it after the Steelers scored 21 points in the game's first 11 minutes.\n\n\"We had a lot of our noses bleeding early on and we just have to stop it,\" Newton said. \"We need to find ways to keep things going in our favor. We just got outplayed today.\"\n\nNewton's showdown with Roethlisberger also never materialized.\n\nRoethlisberger finished 22 of 25 passes for 328 yards with five touchdowns and a perfect 158.3 passer rating. The Steelers, who punted for the first time with 9:34 to play, were 8 of 9 on third down with Roethlisberger in the game.\n\nNewton completed 23 of 29 passes for 193 yards and a pair of flips to Christian McCaffrey that the second-year running back turned into scores.\n\nThe Steelers sacked Newton five times and rarely let him get comfortable as the Panthers' offensive line struggled against the pass rush. Entering Thursday's game, Carolina allowed just 12 sacks, second-fewest through eight games in franchise history.\n\nThe biggest rush came on the 11th snap of the game when Newton threw off his back foot out of the Carolina end zone while trying to avoid getting sacked. Pittsburgh linebacker Vince Williams raced under the floater and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown to give the Steelers a 14-7 lead they never came close to relinquishing.\n\n\"I was just trying to throw the ball away,\" Newton said. \"When you're getting slung around, you can't really control the accuracy. I hit the ground, I looked up and it was an interception.\"\n\nThe Panthers scored 99 points in their last nine quarters entering Thursday's game. That included a franchise-record 35 first-half point outburst during a 14-point win against Tampa Bay last week.\n\nMCaffrey finished with 138 yards of total offense and accounted for all three Carolina scores, but it wasn't nearly enough.\n\n\"This league is hard, this league will humble you real fast,\" Carolina TE Greg Olsen said. \"Hopefully, that's the lesson we get out of tonight. We've got a lot of work to do.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 The first bit of celebrating by the Portland Timbers was premature. The confusing MLS playoff rules created a moment of misunderstanding at the end of extra time and a wild 120 minutes.\n\nThe second celebration, after Dairon Asprilla deposited his winning penalty past Seattle Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei, was pure elation for the Timbers as they advanced to the Western Conference finals and ended the season for their Cascadia rivals to the north.\n\n\"I thought it didn't disappoint. Seattle and Portland brought the rivalry to this match and it was incredible,\" Timbers coach Giovanni Savarese said.\n\nAsprilla's kick sent the Timbers past Seattle 4-2 in a penalty shootout Thursday night after an emotionally exhausting second half and extra time that saw the teams combine for five goals and wild swings of elation and desperation.\n\nSeattle won the second leg of the semifinal matchup 3-2, scoring late in regulation to force extra time before both teams scored early in the extra session. Eventually, the sides decided the winner via penalties, although Portland initially believed it had won at the end of extra time after scoring a second road goal in the match.\n\nThe Timbers claimed the celebration at the end of extra time was due to pride and exhaustion for taking the match to penalties. It ultimately didn't matter because the Timbers finished the job in the shootout.\n\nAsprilla, Lucas Melano, Diego Valeri and Sebastian Blanco scored penalties for Portland. Seattle's goals came from Raul Ruidiaz and Handwalla Bwana, but Will Bruin hit the post and Osvaldo Alonso's shot was saved by Portland goalkeeper Jeff Attinella, atoning for an earlier mistake that led to Seattle's first goal.\n\n\"Being a goalkeeper, you have to shake that off because you always know another one is coming,\" Attinella said. \"All the credit to the guys \u2014 they responded so well for me. I'm just very grateful for the way it turned out.\"\n\nPortland will face Sporting Kansas City or Real Salt Lake in the West finals. It's the Timbers' first trip to the conference finals since winning the MLS Cup in 2015.\n\n\"The end result was not good. But certainly, there were moments of joy and euphoria, happiness. Thinking you had the game in control,\" Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer said. \"And then that gets snatched out away from you.\"\n\nPortland held a 2-1 lead after the first leg at home and the match reached penalties only because of a wild final 25 minutes of regulation and a beginning to extra time that was equally crazy.\n\nSeattle took a 1-0 lead in the match and pulled even at 2-2 on aggregate \u2014 with the road goal tiebreaker \u2014 when Ruidiaz scored in the 68th minute after Attinella mishandled a cross into the penalty area. Less than 10 minutes later, Blanco scored to put the Timbers ahead 3-2 on aggregate and even in the match at 1-all.\n\nIt appeared that would be enough for the Timbers to advance, but Ruidiaz had another special moment waiting. With Seattle frantically scrambling for one more goal that would take the match to extra time, Ruidiaz scored in the third minute of stoppage time. The goal was created by Blanco's mistake, sending a header to the middle of the penalty area rather than away from danger. Ruidiaz hit the volley flush and set off another wild celebration.\n\nOnce the match reached extra time, road goals were no longer a tiebreaker and the rule proved to make a difference. Portland went ahead 4-3 on aggregate when Asprilla scored in the 93rd minute on a perfect cross from Valeri. That lead lasted all of four minutes after Blanco made his second major mistake late in the match, getting called for a clear handball in the penalty area. Nicolas Lodeiro confidently beat Attinella on the penalty kick and the sides were even at 4.\n\nSeattle had a goal by Ruidiaz disallowed in the 113th minute for a clear handball that bounced past Attinella and into the net.\n\nSeattle played without standout midfielder Cristian Roldan and center back Chad Marshall. Roldan strained a hip flexor in the first leg and was considered a game-time decision but was not included among Seattle's starters or subs. Marshall tore the meniscus in his right knee and underwent surgery earlier this week.\n\n\"We showed a lot of heart; just that we care. We didn't give up and that's been a trademark of this team,\" Frei said. \"Somebody has to win. We would have liked it to be us.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Mikko Koivu had three assists, giving him five in his past two games, and Mikael Granlund added an empty-net goal.\n\nDating back to March last season, Niederreiter had gone 22 regular-season games between goals.\n\n\"Every scorer has been there,\" Parise said. \"It's a tough time.

(Nov. 2) AP\n\nCentral American migrants who are taking part in a caravan towards the U.S., rest at a stadium-turned-shelter during a stop in their journey, in Mexico City on Nov. 7, 2018. (Photo: ALFREDO ESTRELLA, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2013 Central American migrants traveling in a caravan plan to leave Mexico City early Friday to continue their long journey northward to the U.S.-Mexico border even as the Trump administration moves forward with its plan to dramatically cut back immigrants\u2019 ability to request asylum.\n\nThe migrants voted late Thursday night to leave Mexico City, beginning at 6 a.m. (EST), en route to the city of Quer\u00e9taro, which is about 120 miles north of the Mexican capital. The migrants, who number between 4,000 and 5,000 and include women and children, will be on foot along a heavily traveled highway after they failed to secure buses from United Nations officials to get them to the U.S. southern border. About 200 marched to a local UN office to demand buses to transport them.\n\nSupporters say the group is looking to go through a safer \u2013 albeit longer \u2013 route to Tijuana, which is at least 1,600 miles away from Quer\u00e9taro.\n\nThe call to set out on Friday morning came only hours after Trump administration officials announced Thursday its plan to restrict asylum claims by refusing to hear cases of anyone not entering the country legally through an authorized port of entry. The administration\u2019s move is expected to be challenged in court by immigrant advocates and others.\n\nUnder U.S. law, migrants are allowed to request asylum whether they present themselves at ports of entry or sidestep those ports and illegally enter the country. But the rules proposed by the administration would bar those who enter illegally from making an asylum claim and place them into expedited deportation proceedings instead, according to a posting by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security on the Federal Register late Thursday.\n\nTrump is likely to sign a presidential proclamation as early as Friday outlining the asylum restrictions, which would kick-start the new rules.\n\nWhen the last caravan reached the USA in April, 401 presented themselves at ports of entry, as the administration has urged them to do, but 122 quit waiting and entered the country illegally to request asylum, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nAt his lengthy and combative news conference on Wednesday, Trump repeated his characterization of the caravan as \u201can invasion\u201d to the U.S. when questioned by a reporter.\n\n\u201cI consider it an invasion, you and I have a difference of opinion,\u201d he told the reporter.\n\nMore: Twelve fiery moments from Trump\u2019s White House press conference\n\nNews of the administration\u2019s proposed restrictions on asylum reached migrants part of the caravan, but didn\u2019t seem to dissuade most from giving up on their goal of getting to the U.S. southern border.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what Donald Trump says,\u201d quipped Honduran migrant Jorge L\u00f3pez, 18, who plans to apply for asylum. \u201cI\u2019ll go through the front door, but if they don\u2019t allow it, I\u2019ll enter whatever way I can.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez previously drove a tricycle taxi in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, one of the most violent cities in the hemisphere. He said he joined the caravan after tattooed gangsters gave him an ultimatum: join them as a hit man or else.\n\n\u201cI fled my country,\u201d L\u00f3pez said on a chilly evening in Mexico City as he searched desperately for a pair of shoes to replace a pair of Crocs he had been given. \u201cI can\u2019t return to Honduras. They\u2019ll kill me.\u201d\n\nCentral American migrants have said they are determined to get to the U.S. border, citing rampant poverty and government corruption, in addition to gang violence and extortion they faced in their home countries.\n\nTo qualify for asylum, migrants must first pass a credible fear of persecution or torture interview at the border conducted by a U.S. immigration officer. Most migrants believe just fleeing violence conditions in their home country and poverty is enough to qualify.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any work. There is a lot of poverty, a lot of crime a lot of a lot of things,\u201d said Maria Lidia Romero, 17, who was traveling with her 6-month-old daughter, Lesli Danesi Romero.\n\nThe caravan had paused in Mexico City since the first migrants started converging Saturday night on the capital \u2013 some 1,000 miles from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, where the first of three caravans currently in Mexico originated on Oct. 12.\n\nThe migrants remain nearly 700 miles from the closest U.S. port of entry at Laredo, Texas, though caravan coordinators have cited Tijuana as the preferred destination due to there being more employment opportunities in the city and relatively less violence than other Mexican border areas.\n\nSome in the caravan raced to Mexico City \u2013 such as L\u00f3pez, who found a trucker willing to take him from Veracruz state to the national capital in a trailer. But many migrants expressed doubts about going it alone.\n\n\u201cIf we were to go it alone, I\u2019d be scared. But in the caravan, there are human rights organizations with us and there\u2019s media coverage,\u201d said Joel Noriega, a Honduran heading north in hopes of \u201csupporting my family.\u201d\n\nNoriega hadn\u2019t heard of the plans to make asylum requests more restrictive, but tough talk from north of the border didn\u2019t discourage him or make him consider trying his luck in Mexico.\n\n\u201cHe says these things,\u201d he said, \u201cBut we\u2019ll take God\u2019s hand and hopefully get through.\u201d\n\nThe caravan\u2019s journey through Mexico has put outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in a bind because taking action against the migrants would appear to be acquiescing to Trump\u2019s demands. During his successful campaign, president-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who takes office in December, said Mexico wouldn\u2019t do the \u201cdirty work of any foreign government.\u201d But he has said little about the caravan other than to promise work visas for migrants choosing to stay in Mexico.\n\nPe\u00f1a Nieto announced a plan for caravan participants called, \u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d which provided temporary work visas and access to health care and education. The majority of caravan participants declined the offer, however, according to a statement from Mexico\u2019s interior ministry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not assured of anything here so it\u2019s better to keep on going,\u201d said Darwin Mejia, 29, an out-of-work construction worker who wanted the opportunity to earn dollars in the United States. \u201cI hope they will give us permission to work. The person who will decide is God. We\u2019re putting ourselves in his hands.\u201d\n\nMexico City, meanwhile, has welcomed the caravan with open arms, housing thousands of migrants in a sports stadium on the east side of the city, offering complimentary health checkups and providing three meals a day. Generous locals dropped off bundles of warm clothes, while barbers cut hair for free and mariachi bands serenaded the guests.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been treated very well,\u201d Noriega said \u201cWe\u2019ve been given food clothes. We can\u2019t complain.\u201d\n\nAt least two more caravans are currently traveling toward Mexico City.\n\nChristopher Gascon, the Mexico representative for the International Organization for Migration, estimated there are an estimated 4,000 migrants in the other caravans working their way through southern Mexico.\n\nMexico City government authorities told The Associated Press that nearly 5,000 migrants are being sheltered in the sports complex, with more than 1,700 migrants under the age of 18, including 310 children under age five.\n\nThe Mexican government told the AP that most of the migrants have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nContributing: Daniel Gonzalez, Arizona Republic; Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/09/migrant-caravan-mexico-president-trump-us-southern-border-immigration-asylum-central-americans/1939241002/", "Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry lays up a shot past Milwaukee Bucks' Malcolm Brogdon (13) during the first half of an NBA basketball game Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Oakland, Calif.

Rivers said Harris was a game-time decision, but he was ultimately in the starting lineup.\n\nHarris, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, finished with 15 points and 11 boards for his fifth double-double this season.\n\nThe Clippers were without Avery Bradley for the second straight game because of a left ankle sprain, and Luc Mbah a Moute missed his seventh game with a sore left knee.\n\nThe Clippers missed Bradley's perimeter defense against Lillard and McCollum.\n\nPortland was without Maurice Harkless, who has missed seven straight games because of a sore left knee. Jake Layman has been starting in his place.\n\nThe Blazers led 37-28 after the first quarter, paced by McCollum's 10 points. Portland never could extend the lead to double digits and led just 61-57 at the break. Gilgeous-Alexander and Montrezl Harrell each had 12 first-half points for the Clippers, while Lillard led all scorers with 14.\n\nAl-Farouq Aminu hit a 3-pointer that gave Portland a 78-68 lead, its largest to that point, midway through the third quarter. The Clippers narrowed it again, closing to 81-77 on Harris' driving floater.\n\n\"We didn't start the game with very good defense. In the first quarter we gave up 37 points,\" Gallinari said. \"Our defense got better but in the fourth quarter they were better than us, especially in the last five or six minutes when they were able to expand the lead.\"\n\nNurkic fouled out with 1:57 left, finishing with 16 points and nine rebounds.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nClippers: The team put out a statement of sympathy for victims of the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California, on Wednesday night. Thousand Oaks is located northwest of Los Angeles. ... The Clippers were coming off a 120-109 win at home over Minnesota.\n\nTrail Blazers: The club held a moment of silence for victims of the shooting in California. ... Portland was coming off a 118-103 win at home over Milwaukee on Tuesday. ... The Blazers have won the last four meetings between the teams. ... Lillard did not shoot a free throw.\n\nCONTINUITY\n\nBefore the game, Rivers said a key to the Blazers' success is their core group has been together for some time. Portland returned 11 players this season, including all five starters.\n\n\"I think our time together, how good we get along together, our understanding of what our coaches want us to do, our understanding of each other \u2014 I think it's all coming together,\" Lillard said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Clippers host the Bucks on Saturday.\n\nThe Trail Blazers host the Celtics on Sunday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This (song) has really been setting things up perfectly and we're about to be off to the races soon.\"\n\nFirst up, there's anthemic new single \"Chances,\" out Friday. Co-written by Shawn Mendes and OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder, the gushy love song talks about the \"two-in-a-million\" chance you'll meet the love of your life in the most precarious, everyday scenario.\n\n\"You don't necessarily have to be set up on a date or go on a dating app to meet that special someone,\" McLean says. As illustrated in its dance-heavy music video, which the Boys co-directed and appear in, \"you could literally miss your train and happen to lock eyes with this person, and just lose yourself in that moment and go to whatever lengths to actually be with that person.\"\n\n\"Chances\" was one of the last songs that the group recorded for \"DNA,\" which aims to go back to basics while pushing their sound forward in new and interesting ways. \"Honey, I'm Good\" singer Andy Grammer, Lauv (Charli XCX's \"Boys\") and Mike Sabath (Liam Payne & J Balvin's \"Familiar\") have writing credits on the album, which was gradually recorded over the past three years between Vegas, Los Angeles and Nashville.\n\nThe latter city informed the country/blues-rock feel of tracks such as \"No Place,\" which is largely autobiographical.\n\n\"I've been all around the world, done all there is to do, but there's no place like home,\" says Richardson, 47. \"That's a song that we were inspired by our families and children to make.\"\n\nBackstreet Boys members Brian Littrell, left, Kevin Richardson, Nick Carter, AJ McLean and Howie Dorough perform in Wantagh, New York, in July.

For the second straight night, though, the Thunder used a stellar defensive effort to overcome their own shooting struggles. Oklahoma City forced 17 turnovers and held Houston to 37.8 percent shooting, including 11-of-42 (26.2 percent) from 3-point range.\n\n\"All year long we've been preaching, as long as we play defense everything else will fall into place,\" George said in an on-court interview with TNT.\n\n\u201cEverybody trusts one another.\u201d@ROSGO21 catches up with Paul George after the @okcthunder's 7th straight win! pic.twitter.com/hMpC7rF4nu \u2014 NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) November 9, 2018\n\n\"We're just gonna help one another.

During the seven-game win streak, they're shooting 48 percent as a team and averaging 115 points a night.\n\nWestbrook is listed as day-to-day with the ankle injury. He missed the preseason and the first two games of the regular season after a summer knee procedure. With the offense finding its rhythm and the defense showing signs of life, the Thunder can be more cautious bringing Westbrook back than they may have initially thought.\n\nOklahoma City's upcoming schedule is also fortuitous. The Thunder's next four games are against teams in the bottom third of the league, then they face the overachieving Sacramento Kings.

(AP Photo/David Banks) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Colliton's NHL coaching debut got off to a shaky start before the Chicago Blackhawks began skating with confidence and made it respectable.\n\nGoals by Andrei Svechnikov, Jaccob Slavin, Phillip Di Giuseppe and Calvin de Haan gave Carolina a four-goal lead early in the second period and the Hurricanes held on for a 4-3 victory over the Blackhawks on Thursday night.\n\nColliton became the 38th coach of the Blackhawks on Tuesday after Joel Quenneville was fired after 10 seasons with Chicago. Quenneville ranked second in NHL history with 890 regular-season victories.\n\nDespite the coaching switch, Chicago suffered through a sluggish, mistake-filled opening 25 minutes. The Blackhawks' winless streak reached six straight (0-5-1) after Colliton was promoted from Chicago's American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford, Illinois, to become the NHL's youngest head coach at 33\n\n\"We looked like we were a bit tentative, especially in our own end, early on,\" Colliton said. \"I think there were some self-inflicted wounds.\n\n\"We had things totally under control, no pressure and we turned it into a situation where they can come at us. These are things we can fix very quickly.\"\n\nPatrick Kane, David Kampf and Nick Schmaltz scored for the Blackhawks after they fell behind 4-0 in a quiet United Center, but the team's comeback came up just short.\n\nSchmaltz said he and his teammates were just thinking too much with a new coach behind the bench. So with Chicago trailing 3-0 after one period, Colliton's message was simple.\n\n\"He just said, 'Don't think out there. Just play hockey. We know how to play hockey. We'll teach as we go,'\" Schmaltz said.\n\nChicago's Corey Crawford blocked 30 shots as he faced many tough chances.\n\nLucas Wallmark had two assists for the Hurricanes, who snapped a five-game slide in the finale of a four-game road trip.\n\nScott Darling, traded to Carolina by the Blackhawks in April 2017, made 35 saves in his third start this season.\n\n\"I almost blew it there, but (having) four goals is nice,\" Darling said. \"It's great to score the first goal and not be chasing the game.\n\n\"They've got tons of skill over there. They're making plays, flying guys in the neutral zone, multiple guys.\"\n\nDarling and the Hurricanes held on for a badly-needed win.\n\n\"It wasn't pretty at times, but it was also nice to play with the lead and have that four-goal cushion,\" de Haan said. \"We grinded it out and ended up getting the two points.\"\n\nCarolina led 3-0 after the first period.\n\nSvechnikov opened the scoring 4:46 in, cutting across the crease and using a long reach to tuck in a loose rebound.\n\nSlavin scored his second goal in two games to make it 2-0 during a power play at 9:09. He poked in a loose puck from the crease after Crawford stopped two point-blank stuff-in attempts by Justin Williams.\n\nDi Giuseppe increased it to 3-0 with 4:07 left in the first on a shot from the left circle after the Blackhawks failed clear their zone.\n\nCrawford chopped his stick on the crossbar and broke it after de Haan scored from just outside the crease 1:20 into the second to extend Carolina's lead to 4-0. DeHaan, a defenseman, was left open after he pinched in and took a nifty feed from Sebastian Aho from behind the net.\n\nKane cut it to 4-1 just over three minutes later, slapping in a puck that had been fired by Artem Anisimov from the slot and was trickling toward the goal line.\n\nKampf was credited with a deflection at 10:53 of the period that cut it to 4-2. Brandon Saad powered from behind the net to high in the slot, then turned and fired on net to create the chance.\n\nSchmaltz narrowed it to 4-3 at 3:33 of the third when he carried the puck into the Carolina zone and beat Darling from the left circle.\n\nNOTES: Blackhawks C Marcus Kruger suffered a left leg injury in the second period and didn't return. . Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews was clipped by a high stick in the final minutes and needed stitches, but should be ready to play on Saturday, Colliton said. . Petr Mrazek, the Hurricanes No. 1 goalie so far this season, missed his third game with a lower-body injury. ... Saad played with a plastic full-face shield after taking a puck in the mouth in practice on Wednesday, then undergoing dental work and getting about 15 stiches. ... Di Giuseppe had been recalled from Charlotte of the AHL on Wednesday and played in his third game this season. ...

The Aces turned the ball over 25 times, leading to 32 Illini points.\n\n\"They were very physical,\" said Evansville coach Walter McCarty. \"But 25 turnovers? You can't win games with numbers like that.\"\n\nAndres Feliz and Kipper Nichols added 16 and 13 points respectively for the Illini. Freshman center Giorgi Bezhanishvili grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds.\n\nK. J. Riley led the Aces with 14 points. Marty Hill scored 13 points and Shea Feehan added 12 for Evansville.\n\n\"There were a lot of things to like tonight,\" said Illinois coach Brad Underwood. \"I was really pleased we had 22 assists. We are capable of that every night. This is a very athletic and unselfish team.\"\n\nIllinois was in charge from the opening tip, going on runs of 10-0, 13-0 and 16-1 to lead 53-22 at the break. The Aces turned the ball over 15 times in the first half, leading to 18 Illini points.\n\nIllinois showed a lot of speed and athleticism, and seemingly wore out the Aces by the end of the game.\n\n\"We allowed them to get out into transitions a lot off turnovers, and they were very fast,\" McCarty said. \"Our turnovers allowed them to take advantage throughout the whole game, although I thought we were a bit more composed the second half.\"\n\nUnderwood said his team purposefully slowed the pace in the second half. \"We did slow it down some, simply because of the score.\"\n\nJordan, who was 5 of 8 from the 3-point line, gave credit to his teammates.\n\n\"They found me and I took the shots.

Two players expected to make an impact this year, guard Alan Griffin and 7-foot center Samba Kane, didn't play Thursday. Griffin tweaked a knee in practice, while Kane violated an undetermined team rule and was held out. Underwood said both players will be available for the next game.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nJordan hit two 3-pointers and scored eight points in less than a minute, sparking a 13-0 run that put the Illini up 35-14 with 8:09 to play in the first half.\n\nALL TALK\n\nBezhanishvili, a crowd favorite originally from the country of Georgia before moving to Austria and eventually to New Jersey, was called for a technical foul in the second half, which mystified many since he'd seemingly done nothing wrong.\n\n\"Well, I was talking a little too much to the referee,\" he said, smiling broadly. \"I do talk a lot, you know. I should not do that I guess.\"\n\nJordan agreed. \"Giorgi is a personality kind of guy. He'll learn his boundaries eventually.\"\n\nHIGHLIGHT REEL\n\nIllinois scored 22 of its 53 first-half points in the paint, including a spectacular cross-court pass from Nichols to Bezhanishvili for a rim-rattling dunk with 30 seconds left in the half that brought the crowd to its feet.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nEvansville: The Aces travel to Xavier on Saturday.\n\nIllinois: The Illini host Georgetown on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Utah showed moments of brilliance in its season opener. It also made plenty of mistakes characteristic of a young and inexperienced basketball team.\n\n\"Got to be better defensively. Got to stick to the game plan. Got to take better care of the ball,\" senior guard Sedrick Barefield said, checking off the areas where he feels like the Utes need to improve.\n\nUtah seemed ready to cruise to an easy win after the Utes opened the game by connecting on their first seven field-goal attempts and started 9 of 10 from the field. That run of baskets included six 3-pointers.\n\nThen Utah got a taste of the other end of that spectrum in the second half when it endured a scoring drought lasting more than nine minutes. The Utes weren't as successful in getting stops and Maine threw out a 1-1-3 zone that helped the Black Bears hang around.\n\n\"Typically, in an overall sense, if (we) get stops, we're a pretty good team,\" Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak said. \"Not just because we didn't let the other team score, but because we have some guys that can get out and run and do some things in transition and the offensive end isn't such a grind.\"\n\nBarefield scored 18 points and Donnie Tillman added 15 to lead Utah. The Utes (1-0) prevailed after shooting 49 percent from the field and finishing with a 42-26 advantage on the glass.\n\nIsaiah White scored 24 points and Terion Moss added 13 to lead the Black Bears (0-2). Maine trailed wire-to-wire after shooting just 40 percent.\n\nHot shooting out of the gate resulted in a quick double-digit lead for the Utes.\n\nAfter White turned a steal into a fastbreak dunk to cut Utah's lead to 14-8, Barefield responded with back-to-back 3-pointers to push the advantage back to double digits. Vante Hendrix followed with two more baskets on consecutive possessions a minute later. Hendrix's second basket \u2014 a 3-pointer he set up with a steal \u2014 put Utah up 25-10 with 12:16 left in the first half.\n\nMaine cut the deficit to 10 twice before halftime.\n\nTimmy Allen made a layup and fed Riley Batten to set up another to give Utah a 45-28 halftime lead.\n\nThe aforementioned nine-minute cold spell for Utah's offense prevented the Utes from building on the lead after halftime. It allowed Maine to pull within 60-51 on a 3-pointer from Moss with 6:09 left.\n\n\"I was extremely pleased with our toughness, in terms of how we continued to fight, even when we made some mistakes mentally, we moved onto the next play really well,\" Maine coach Richard Barron said.\n\nBarefield finally ended the drought with a jumper. Utah then ran off four straight baskets, culminating in a Parker Van Dyke 3-pointer to take a 71-57 lead with 2:44 remaining.\n\nWHITE SHINES\n\nAfter averaging 11.1 points a year ago, White may be on the cusp of playing a bigger part in Maine's offense this season. The redshirt junior scored a career-high 24 points while also matching a career-high with nine field goals. White is the leading scorer for the Black Bears through two games, averaging 16.5 points on 43 percent shooting.\n\nNEW FACES\n\nNine new players joined Utah during the offseason and six of them made their debut with the Utes on Thursday. The top performers among the newcomers were graduate transfer Novak Topalovic and true freshman Allen. Topalovic totaled nine points and nine rebounds. Allen had six points, six boards, and six assists.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMaine: The Black Bears should get a boost of confidence from hanging around with Utah in the second half. Their shooting was a bit too erratic in the first half to truly give them an upset chance, but they could put a scare into other opponents during their six-game road trip with improvement.\n\nUtah: Inconsistency gripped a Utah team filled with newcomers. The Utes were solid on defense as usual, but endured long cold spells on offense. There could be some growing pains for Utah as the schedule gets tougher, but the Utes do have enough length, speed, and athleticism to be a dangerous team once they have enough experience.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMaine: The Black Bears continue a season-opening six-game road trip at San Francisco on Saturday.\n\nUtah: The Utes will hit the road for the first time when they play at Minnesota on Monday.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Panthers (6-3) fell 1\u00bd games behind the NFC South-leading New Orleans Saints, and could soon face a challenge from behind by the scorching Atlanta Falcons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling to (beat) a good football team,\" said Roethlisberger.\n\nThree other things we learned:\n\n1. This was the first time in Pittsburgh's hot streak that RB James Conner didn't rush for at least 100 yards (65 yards, TD) \u2014 mostly because he didn't need to, and also because he was evaluated for a concussion in the second half. Big Ben spread the wealth among his weapons exceptionally well \u2014 including a 53-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown, who somehow wound up single-covered by Carolina rookie CB Donte Jackson, that put the Steelers up 31-14 going into the half. Of course, the Pittsburgh offense could be altered drastically in the coming days with all-pro RB Le'Veon Bell expected to rejoin the team by Tuesday's deadline to report if he wants to play this season.\n\n'NO INTENT': Roethlisberger says Reid was apologetic after late hit\n\nWEEK 10 PICKS: Can Cowboys stop slide in Philly?\n\nIN A FOUL MOOD: Cowboys practice angry ahead of showdown vs. Eagles\n\n2. Newton and Carolina RB Christian McCaffrey looked poised to have their way with the Steelers based on the initial march. McCaffrey racked up 60 of the 75 yards, capping it off with a 20-yard scoring pass from Newton, who's having a campaign approaching his 2015 MVP effort. But the Pittsburgh defense has been resurgent during the team's winning streak and quickly buckled down, starting with Williams' pick six, and kept the Panthers' star duo largely in check (though McCaffrey did also score a cosmetic TD in the second quarter, he only totaled 78 yards after his initial touchdown). The Steelers' special teams also got into the act. K Chris Boswell drilling a 50-yard field goal, and the coverage unit forced a Curtis Samuel fumble on a kickoff at the end of the third quarter that set up another TD to start the final period. Bottom line: Dominant team effort near the confluence of the Three Rivers.\n\n3. Not a very memorable night for Pittsburgh native, Pitt and Carnegie Mellon alum and former Steelers minority owner David Tepper, who bought the Panthers from disgraced predecessor Jerry Richardson earlier this year and roamed the sideline before kickoff. Still, he's got a good team that simply got steamrolled on an off night. However the Panthers do need to learn how to prevail on the road given they've never won a playoff game away from Charlotte in the Cam Newton era. They're 5-0 at Bank of America Stadium this year, but just 1-3 away from it.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

The redshirt senior, who was a key part of Northwestern's run to the NCAA tournament in 2017, passed 1,000 career points early in the game, becoming the 36th player in program history to top the plateau.\n\nRyan Taylor, a graduate transfer from Evansville, added 20 points, including six 3-pointers.\n\nLaw's known for his defensive prowess, but he showed off his versatility against the Privateers.\n\n\"His whole career, since we recruited Vic, I've always saw him as a jack-of-all-trades guy,\" said Northwestern coach Chris Collins. \"When he's at his best, he's impacting the game in every way, with defense, with rebounding, with playmaking, with shooting, with activity. I thought he showed that tonight.\"\n\nLaw acknowledged after the game he knew he was close to the milestone as his final season as a Wildcat started.\n\n\"Do you want me to lie to you or do you want me to tell you the truth?\" Law asked reporters. \"I knew! I wasn't going for it. I knew I was close. I knew if I played my normal game, if I played aggressive, everything would work itself out.\"\n\n\"The team was unselfish. They figured out he had a hot hand, and I think what will make them a good team in this rugged Big Ten is that they were smart enough in game one to figure out he had a hot hand and get him the ball,\" said New Orleans coach Mark Slessinger.\n\nTaylor is one of two transfers on Northwestern's team. With four freshmen on the roster, the Wildcats (1-0) are still trying to figure some things out.\n\n\"It took a while to get used to the offense. There's still things I struggle with.

I'm a fun guy to play for when it comes to that. You're not going to get yelled at for shooting the ball. I might get on you for lack of effort or not being a good teammate, or not being locked in to some of our game plan stuff, but I was a gunslinger when I played, and I want our guys to shoot freely. I want them to take their shots and be cocky, and all of them have a green light in that regard,\" Northwestern coach Chris Collins.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNorthwestern started the season unranked, but with its highest-ranked recruiting class in school history.

(Fred Chartrand/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOTTAWA, Ontario (AP) \u2014 In the midst of a so-so sophomore season, the Golden Knights finally scored in bunches.\n\nWilliam Carrier put Vegas ahead for good after Ottawa rallied from a three-goal deficit, and the Golden Knights beat the Senators 5-3 on Thursday night.\n\nVegas, which reached the Stanley Cup final in its inaugural season but has hovered around .500 so far in this campaign, scored more than three goals in regulation for the first time since Oct. 16, a span of nine games.\n\n\"We played a real good game,\" coach Gerald Gallant said. \"The puck finally went in the net for us so that was a real key for us to get five goals. We're happy with that.\"\n\nJonathan Marchessault, Shea Theodore, Nick Holden and Pierre-Edouard Bellemare also scored for the Golden Knights. Marc-Andre Fleury made 27 saves.\n\nMatt Duchene, Ryan Dzingel and Thomas Chabot scored for the Senators, who fell behind 3-0 late in the second period before coming back to tie it in the third. Craig Anderson stopped 37 shots.\n\nTrailing 3-1 to start the third, Ottawa scored twice in just over a minute to make it 3-3. Dzingel scored at 6:57, and Chabot converted into a wide-open net as Fleury was caught sprawling.\n\nVegas regained the lead about a minute later as Carrier won a battle along the boards, stepped around Mark Borowiecki and beat Anderson stick side.\n\nBellemare got the final goal into a wide-open net after Anderson got tangled with Carrier. The Senators challenged unsuccessfully for goaltender interference, a call that infuriated coach Guy Boucher, who said he isn't sure what constitutes interference anymore.\n\n\"I don't know anymore,\" Boucher said. \"All of us together, we just don't know anymore. I'll let them decide and that's it. I can't make it, whether it's our game or somebody else's game. I guess that's why I'm not paid for those decisions.\"\n\nThe goal with 8 minutes remaining was deflating for the Senators.\n\n\"It's human nature,\" Boucher said. \"I was 100 percent sure it was going to be goaltender interference, so it's just mind-boggling so by the time you get rid of the frustration and all that it's two goals. If it's one goal, it might have been different.\"\n\nVegas dominated much of the second period and took a 3-0 lead late when Holden jumped into the play and lifted the puck over Anderson's right shoulder. It was the well-traveled defenseman's first goal for Vegas.\n\nOttawa finally solved Fleury 29 seconds later when the goalie poke-checked Chabot and the puck went right to Duchene. Mike Stone picked up an assist, extending his point streak to five games.\n\n\"I thought we did some really good things,\" Duchene said. \"Obviously when you tie it 3-3 in the third, it can go either way. We had the momentum, so tough way to lose.\"\n\nDuchene's goal came after Borowiecki accepted a challenge from Ryan Reaves to drop the gloves.\n\n\"There's been a couple high hits on our team the last couple weeks,\" Reaves said. \"Everybody knows that if you're going to do that, you're going to have to answer the bell. Good on him for answering the bell, not a lot of guys will do that, but good on him.\"\n\nThe Knights got two power-play goals in the first period.

KARE\n\nThe accusations surfaced when his ex-girlfriend\u2019s son said on Facebook that he had seen text messages from the Minnesota Democrat threatening his mother and a video showing Ellison dragging her off a bed by her feet while screaming obscenities.\n\nThe former girlfriend, Karen Monahan, said at the time that \u201cevery statement\u201d her son made was \u201ctrue.\u201d Monahan, a political organizer in Minnesota, has been vocal about the #MeToo movement and previously tweeted about being a victim, but had not mentioned Ellison's name until that point.\n\nEllison denied the allegations, saying, \u201cKaren and I were in a long-term relationship which ended in 2016, and I still care deeply for her well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis video does not exist because I have never behaved in this way, and any characterization otherwise is false,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nContributing: Donovan Slack\n\nCLOSE Democrats elected former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as their new national chairman on Saturday over Rep.

They displayed the renewed confidence with a comeback victory in their return to home ice.\n\nShayne Gostisbehere scored on a one-timer 1:01 into overtime after Weise tied the game with 2:13 left in regulation, and Philadelphia rallied past the Arizona Coyotes 5-4 on Thursday night.\n\nScott Laughton had two goals and Travis Konecny also scored for the Flyers (8-7-1), who began a five-game homestand \u2014 their longest of the season \u2014 after earning seven of a possible eight points on a four-game trip out West. Philadelphia went over .500 for the first time since winning its season opener against Vegas.\n\n\"We're a confident team,\" coach Dave Hakstol said. \"Guys in the room are tight. You either blow apart or come together. This was a good sign tonight. This was a character win.\"\n\nJakub Voracek set up the game-winner in the extra session with a pass to Gostisbehere in the slot, and the defenseman's slap shot beat goalie Darcy Kuemper.\n\n\"We had a purpose and it showed,\" Gostisbehere said. \"Huge for morale. Huge for us.\"\n\nIt appeared the Flyers were going to lose their third in a row at home until Weise tied it.\n\nOliver Ekman-Larsson's pass in the Arizona zone was intercepted by Gostisbehere. Weise broke toward center ice on the turnover, and Gostisbehere fired a pass to him. Weise got in alone on Kuemper and beat him high to the glove side for his first goal of the season.\n\nWeise said the road trip, void of distractions, helped the Flyers come together.\n\n\"It's just the boys on the road and you get that team bonding,\" he said.\n\nEkman-Larsson and Michael Grabner each had a goal and an assist, and Brad Richardson and Derek Stepan also scored for the Coyotes, who lost 5-2 at home to Philadelphia on Monday.\n\n\"It's a learning lesson for this team,\" coach Rich Tocchet said. \"We started to take over the game and then we reverted back to old habits.\"\n\nArizona went ahead by scoring three times in the second period, including two short-handed goals 24 seconds apart.\n\nRichardson tied it 2-all 1:51 into the second when his wrist shot from the right circle beat Calvin Pickard to the far side. Stepan scored with a backhand on a short-handed breakaway with 13:46 left in the period after Gostisbehere's turnover at the Philadelphia blue line.\n\nGrabner then got in alone on Pickard and also scored with a backhand.\n\nHakstol pulled Pickard in favor of Brian Elliott after Grabner's goal. Elliott, the Flyers' regular starter, wasn't in the initial lineup following an upper-body injury he sustained in a collision with Konecny at practice on Sunday.\n\nElliott stopped all 16 shots he faced.\n\nLaughton scored his second of the night 2\u00bd minutes into the third on a backhand after a scramble in front.\n\nPhiladelphia got the first goal, just as it did in all four games on the road trip.\n\nKonecny finished with a backhand from close range after a good pass from Claude Giroux at the point to make it 1-0 just 1:18 in.

I may have given up one or two 3s.\"\n\nThere wasn't much shame in that, since 17 of Saint Francis' 20 baskets were from long range. Jess Kovatch, who set an NCAA record with 141 3-pointers last season and was the nation's second-leading scorer at 24.1 points per game, scored 15 on 5-of-15 shooting from 3.\n\n\"It's the way that Saint Francis plays,\" Red Flash coach Joe Haigh said. \"But it's also a product of playing against Baylor. So we know that you play a team with that size and the shot-blocking ability of Baylor, we're not going to get anything in the paint. Why go in there?\"\n\nFreshman NaLyssa Smith recorded her first double-double with 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Lady Bears (2-0), who won a second straight game against an overmatched opponent that reached the NCAA Tournament last season before losing to a No. 1 seed.\n\nCourtney Zezza had 14 points and four blocks for the Red Flash (0-2), whose 12th NCAA appearance ended in the first round against UConn last season. Nicholls State, which lost to Baylor 100-39 in the opener, fell to top-seeded Mississippi State.\n\nChloe Jackson had 17 points, six assists and four steals \u2014 all four in the first half, including three that led to breakaway layups. The graduate transfer from LSU was 7 of 7 from the field to help the Lady Bears shoot 66 percent.\n\nFreshman Queen Egbo also was perfect from the field, making all six of her shots and finishing with 14 points. But she was 2 of 5 on free throws as the Lady Bears shot just 52 percent (15 of 29) from the line.\n\nBaylor finished the first quarter on a 25-0 run after Saint Francis took a 9-7 lead by making three straight 3-pointers. The Red Flash then launched 11 in a row from long range, missing them all. Saint Francis shot 28 percent, obviously highlighted by going 17 of 57 from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Lady Bears did have four blocks, with two from Cox, who had nine points and eight rebounds.\n\n\"There was just a stretch there that they scored too many points,\" Baylor coach Kim Mulkey said. \"When we play teams that spread the floor like that, it's very obvious to be concerned with Kalani having to go outside, Cox having to go outside.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSaint Francis: After blowout losses against a pair of high-profile opponents (Rutgers was the opener), the Red Flash get a few games against teams that figure to look more like Northeast Conference opponents. The next bigger name is Washington in mid-December.\n\nBaylor: Turnovers were the spark for the first big run by the Lady Bears. They forced 11 in the first quarter for half of their 32 points. Saint Francis finished with 28 turnovers for 42 Baylor points. The down side for Mulkey was Baylor having 21 turnovers.\n\nSTARK CONTRAST\n\nHaigh said his team normally takes about half its shots from 3-point range, so the 80 percent rate was a concession to the size of the Lady Bears, who list four players 6-2 or taller. Saint Francis had 12 players shoot at least one 3. The Lady Bears attempted just four, with Smith making one of her two.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nBrown scored 10 points in the third quarter, which included an 18-0 Baylor run. ...

(AP) \u2014 Chris Mack would've preferred a smoother start to his Louisville coaching debut and seemed happy only about the outcome.\n\nLittle was pretty about the Cardinals' opener, but at least it ended successfully against Nicholls State.\n\nSteven Enoch had 15 points including a pair of critical free throws with 1:57 remaining, Darius Perry added 14 points and the Cardinals thrived at the foul line to hold off the Colonels 85-72 on Thursday night in Mack's first game with the Cardinals.\n\nThe Cardinals (1-0) led by 14 with 7:51 remaining but needed free throws to put away the stubborn Colonels (1-1), whose 50 percent 3-point shooting in the second half helped get them within 68-66 with 3:40 remaining. V.J. King (12 points) made a free throw, Perry added a layup and Enoch made two more from the line to make it 73-66.\n\nAs foul troubles eliminated several Nicholls players \u2014 the Colonels lost five overall \u2014 the Cardinals took advantage at the line. King, Christen Cunningham, Dwayne Sutton and Perry combined to make all of the team's final 12 free throws, and Louisville went on to seal a successful if tense opener for Mack, who took over Louisville in March after successful nine-year tenure at Xavier.\n\nAsked how it felt to win, Mack answered, \"Not very good to be honest with you. I don't think we played very well. I didn't think we were very tough. We've got tougher games coming.\n\n\"I'm happy that we won, certainly not the way we won. We've got to figure it out.\"\n\nMack can take heart in his team making free throws when it had to.\n\nIt started with Enoch, a Connecticut transfer, who made all nine free throws. Louisville eventually hit 29 of 36 from the line after halftime to finish 42 of 55 overall.\n\nJordan Nwora added 12 points off the bench while Sutton had nine for the Cardinals, who began a new chapter under Mack after the program was implicated last fall in a federal corruption investigation of college basketball and a 2015 sex scandal.\n\nLouisville shot 19 of 40 and outrebounded Nicholls 39-30.\n\n\"We knew we had to close the game out, take care of the ball, not turn the ball over and make free throws,\" Sutton said.\n\n\"That's not how we wanted to play our first game. At the end of the day we came out with a victory. We'll chalk it up and go to film and watch how we can improve for our next opponent.\"\n\nJeremiah Jefferson made 7 of 12 3-pointers for 24 points to lead Nicholls (1-1), which hit 12 of 32 from long range.

The Colonels made just three field goals over the final 3:40 and were left to slow down the Cardinals by fouling them.\n\n\"We battled,\" first-year coach Austin Claunch said. \"We knew there was going to be some adversity, obviously. We've been through some funky lineups, but we battled through it and gave ourselves a chance to make it interesting and potentially pull it out.\"\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals will remain a work in progress under Mack but showed spark at times in their coach's debut.

Burns then completed a 3-point play after his slam dunk and Rex Pflueger canned a 3-pointer to put the Irish back in command again, 52-35, with 17:03 to play.\n\nNotre Dame's lead reached 32 points with 6:02 remaining on two free throws by freshman starter Robby Carmody, who had eight points.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNotre Dame: With a roster that features four freshmen - Laszewski, Carmody, Dane Goodwin (seven points) and Prentiss Hubb (six) - plus 6-foot-11 UConn transfer Juwan Durham (two) playing for only the second time, the Irish struggled offensively in the first half, especially with Gibbs and Pflueger scoring just five and three points, respectively, in the first half. Pflueger finished with nine points.\n\nBrey says it's a learning experience for him, too, with all the youth.\n\n\"I mentioned to the assistants, 'Tonight, I feel we're playing too many guys,'\" said Brey, who had 10 of his 12 players play double-digit minutes. \"We have to think about shaving it down. It's something I'm trying to get a feel for.\"\n\nChicago State: The Cougars, too, had a roster makeover in the offseason, with seven returnees being joined by seven newcomers and their new head coach. Their immediate growth will take place on the road as Chicago State started this season with seven games away from home, including Tuesday's 104-55 loss at Indiana.\n\nSTAT WATCH\n\nThe Irish shot 43.7 percent for the game (31 of 71) and 32.5 percent (13 of 40) from beyond the 3-point line. Eight players had a 3-pointer, led by three each from Laszewski and Pflueger. . Harvey, still getting himself in shape after knee surgery, had 11 points and a team-high seven rebounds (Notre Dame won the boards, 41-29) in 19 minutes. . The Irish had 18 assists and committed just six turnovers while forcing 13.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNotre Dame: Continues its seven-game home stand Wednesday against Radford in the Gotham Classic.\n\nChicago State: Plays its third road game in four days Friday night when it visits Central Michigan after a three-hour-plus bus trip from South Bend.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP-Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Michael Ainsworth, AP)\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 The Cowboys showed up to practice angry this week.\n\nCowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was glad they did.\n\n\u201cI mean we were pissed,\u201d Prescott said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019d have been even more pissed if I came in here and guys weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cPissed off Monday night after the game, Tuesday morning,\u201d added linebacker Jaylon Smith, de facto quarterback of Dallas\u2019 D in veteran Sean Lee\u2019s absence. \u201cPissed off now.\u201d\n\nCowboys defensive lineman Tyrone Crawford turned the question around.\n\n\u201cThink about how you would feel,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cafter a loss that can\u2019t happen. We can\u2019t lose right now.\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t got no other choice but to win these games.\u201d\n\nMathematically, the 3-5 Cowboys aren\u2019t playoff ineligible. But an offense whose 19.2 points ranks 26th in the league knows time is ticking. Losing Jason Witten (retirement), Dez Bryant (released, now with Saints) and Travis Frederick (autoimmune disorder) gives Dallas no reassurance about its dip in production since 2016 from 26.3 points per game to 22.1 in 2017 to 19.3 this season.\n\nRunning back Ezekiel Elliott and recently traded-for receiver Amari Cooper are each top-5 draft picks under 25 years old.\n\nThe offense has weapons. But it\u2019s not capitalizing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to get better all the way around this whole team and play complementary football,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cThe run game\u2019s got to be good when the pass game has got to be good.\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t be up and the other down.\u201d\n\nThey attacked this process vigorously Wednesday.\n\nThe defense studied third downs more carefully this week after allowing Tennessee to convert on 79 percent (11-of-14) of third downs Monday, more than twice as loose as the D\u2019s previously stingy 39.4 percent. The offense continued to scheme Cooper into its game plan this week, interested in exploring the versatility and \u201cmismatch\u201d (Prescott\u2019s words) he showed in college at Alabama running out of both the backfield and slot.\n\n'WE SUCK': 7-year-old Cowboys fan writes brutal letter to Jerry Jones\n\nARMOUR: Jerry Jones in danger of becoming the NFL's biggest loser\n\nDEZ BRYANT: WR a 'pretty big thing' to worry about for Cowboys\n\nThe team also worked to set aside the emotions that left Prescott sitting in his AT&T Stadium locker alone for minutes after the 28-14 loss Monday. He was processing another game of ball insecurity, this time with an end zone interception and third quarter fumble. Prescott now has 12 turnovers in eight games after a career built on excellent ball security, including a rookie season in which he threw 23 touchdowns and just four interceptions.\n\nTurnovers are new to the 135th pick of the 2016 draft.\n\nSo is a 3-5 record.\n\nPrescott\u2019s never dropped this low at the high school, college or NFL level.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to lose,\u201d Prescott said, explaining why Monday hit him so hard. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m used to and not something I plan to ever get used to.\u201d\n\nHe processed that disappointment at his locker, he said.\n\nAnd now?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving forward, being positive and knowing how to steer the team we\u2019ve got, the offense we\u2019ve got and where we\u2019re going to go.\u201d\n\nWhere the Cowboys go first is division-rival Philadelphia, whose 4-4 record is good enough for second in the division. Even without top running backs Jay Ajayi (ACL tear) or Darren Sproles (hamstring), the Eagles own the best time-of-possession advantage in the league at 33:46. The Tennessee Titans held the ball 8:52 longer than the run-first Cowboys on Monday.\n\nCLOSE Although Jerry Jones told media he won't fire Jason Garrett in-season, the Cowboys head coach shouldn't get too comfortable.

It goes into how A-Rod saw the success a juiced-up Manny, who would get hit with a 50-game suspension for PEDs, had with the Dodgers and asked Bosch to get him on that program. It goes into how A-Rod hit three home runs in a game against the Royals shortly after starting treatments with Bosch. It goes into A-Rod\u2019s battle with MLB to try to get his season-plus long suspension overturned. It goes into Rodriguez paying protesters in pizza to show up outside of MLB\u2019s NYC offices on the day of the arbitration hearing when he infamously kicked over a lawyer\u2019s briefcase before storming out of the room.\n\n\u201cOur effort (in telling the story) isn\u2019t to remind everyone what an a\u2014\u2014 (Rodriguez) is,\u201d Corben said, \u201cit\u2019s just to tell the truth in what happened in the story.\u201d\n\nBut much like Corben\u2019s other work, the tone of the film is done in such a fun way that it\u2019s hard to look away from it during the 90-plus minutes that it lasts.\n\n\u201cWe were looking to create Coen brothers-esque experience of telling a quirky tale about a wild cast of characters\u2026 and highlighting the absurdity of it all was the goal,\u201d Corben told For The Win this week. \u201cThe idea I came away from it [is], \u2018These are the new values of America.\u2019 That\u2019s something I walked away with in the middle of some interviews we did during filming and seeing how Alex and MLB behaved. While it seems like a uniquely Florida story, it struck me as reflecting values of America now, ones that I think are warped and misguided. In the end, (the story) kind of had a \u2018crime paid\u2019 aspect to it. MLB and Alex ended up winning. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and that\u2019s so America 2018.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that this is a documentary that MLB and A-Rod would rather you not see, I\u2019m certain of that,\u201d Corben said.\n\nThe story is mostly told through first-hand accounts of two key guys, who happen to be two classic characters from the Miami area \u2014 Tony Bosch, the founder and owner of Biogenis who was also the fake doctor who controlled and oversaw all the players\u2019 PED programs, and Porter Fisher, a South Florida resident who loved tanning salons and Bosch\u2019s ability to make him look buff.\n\nBut what makes this documentary so unique and enjoyable is that Corben used child actors to play out all the characters in the story, lip-synching the lines being told by Bosch and Fisher. Here\u2019s a taste of the film, make sure you stick around for A-Rod at the end of this:\n\nCorben didn\u2019t go into this thinking he would have child actors being in it at all, but that the idea struck him one day during during filming.\n\n\u201cWhile watching the interviews of Tony and Porter I noticed the way they both were very moment-by-moment in the way they tell a story,\u201d Corben said. \u201cThey provide the step-by-step dialogue and so I was like, \u2018OK, we can Drunk History this.\u2019 And then it struck me how every single adult in this story acted like a child. Every single one of them. I was like here\u2019s our idea. It was a perfect story for it.\u201d\n\nWhile many players (Manny, Melky Cabrera, Bartolo Colon, and others) used Bosch\u2019s services, A-Rod acted much differently and therefore plays a larger role in the film.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why Alex is in the movie even more than the others is he appealed the suspension and went on to that arbitration,\u201d Corben explained. \u201cEveryone else just took their lumps because they were guilty. They didn\u2019t want to drag it out any longer than necessary. Alex just didn\u2019t know how to admit he was wrong. That\u2019s the most troubling thing \u2014 and \u2018Trumpian\u2019 thing about it, too \u2014 he was incapable of admitting that he was wrong. He was incapable of admitting that he made a mistake or that he cheated. It was just like, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t do this.\u2019 And I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s ever said out loud, \u2018Yes, I did do this.\u2019 He\u2019s joked about it and I guess he\u2019s apologized in some obscure interviews that he\u2019s done more recently but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever admitted that \u2018Every single thing I said no to and denied \u2014 I did all of that.\u2019 And yet he is this beloved and pop-culture figure now.\u201d\n\nSo does Corben think all of these details will make people look at A-Rod any differently after seeing the film? In a word, no.\n\n\u201cEverybody remember how much of an a\u2014\u2013 he was and nobody cares now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have new values in this country. When we were kids we were taught core values to a happy, healthy and successful life \u2014 honesty, integrity, treating other people the way we would want them to treat us. And now it\u2019s like, lie, cheat, and steal and that\u2019s how you get successful and that\u2019s how you get ahead. And those are sort of the new core American values and that\u2019s what we\u2019re teaching our children. And I think that\u2019s how MLB behaved, that\u2019s how Alex behaved \u2014 lie cheat and steal and you can become president of the United States. I think that\u2019s the message we\u2019re sending to our children. Those are America\u2019s new core values for happiness and success so I don\u2019t really see what difference this movie will make in terms of his reputation now \u2013 everyone knows what he did and that he lied to everybody with impunity and that he tried to cover it up with impunity. I don\u2019t think the way MLB behaved was that much better, it might have been worse, in fact. I think that might surprise more people than the Alex part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrewball\u201d will teach you things that you didn\u2019t know, or maybe details you forgot about the steroid-era in baseball. And it does it all in fun, brilliant ways. It\u2019s also a wild story with so many different characters that could really only take place in the state where Corben was born, raised, and resides.\n\n\u201cFlorida rarely shocks me but it regularly disappoints me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is one of those cases where we might have crossed that threshold.\u201d", "", "ITHACA, N.Y.

These gains were driven by a mix of successful female candidates, exceptional voter turnout and support from wealthy, suburban voters.\n\nFemale candidates won in 23 of the 36 districts that Democrats took on Tuesday.\n\nThis surge in wins by women \u2013 which has roots in resistance to the Trump presidency \u2013 resulted in gains for Democrats during this election cycle.\n\nTwenty-one of the districts that changed hands saw more votes for the Democrat than in 2016, excluding Pennsylvania districts, which are not comparable to the last election.\n\nMinnesota's 3rd District was emblematic of the increase in Democratic turnout. In 2016, the Democratic candidate got 169,000 votes, losing to Republican Eric Paulsen by 13 points. Tuesday, more than 202,000 cast their votes for Dean Phillips, who beat Paulsen by nearly the same margin.\n\nDemocrats did well in districts populated with wealthy voters and those who benefited from low unemployment and a strong economy. Twenty-seven of the 36 flipped districts had above average median household income and 30 of 36 had lower than average unemployment.\n\nDespite losing in most rural districts, Democrats made significant inroads with suburban voters. Twenty-six of the flipped districts had an above-average percentage of the population living in urban areas. Twenty-seven of the districts had a greater percentage of college-educated voters than the national average.\n\nRedistricting contributed to these wins, especially in Pennsylvania, where a state court redrew congressional districts to curb a GOP advantage gained through gerrymandering.\n\nDemocrats increased their share of the vote by an average of 9 percentage points in the districts they took. The biggest change came in California\u2019s 49th District, where the share of Democratic votes jumped from 30 percent in 2016 to 54 percent this year.\n\nThis trend holds across the most of the country \u2013 even in the places they lost, Democrats gained a greater share of the vote than they did in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nContributing: Matt Wynn, John Fritze, Brad Heath, Mark Nichols and Jim Sergent.\n\nSources: USA TODAY analysis, The Associated Press, U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nPhoto: Democrat Madeleine Dean celebrates Tuesday after winning Pennsylvania's 4th Congressional District race.

(Photo: Justin Lane, EPA-EFE)\n\nClusters of wealthy, educated suburban voters shifted their loyalties to Democratic candidates on Tuesday, turning on Republicans and allowing Democrats to regain control of the House.\n\nA USA TODAY analysis of midterm election returns across the nation found more than 80 suburban counties and cities \u2013 with high incomes and a large number of college-educated voters \u2013 voted more Democratic compared to 2016.\n\nThe majority of the areas showed single-digit-percentage-point increases for Democrats, but more than 20 witnessed a double-digit swing, sometimes turning red counties blue. Cobb County outside Atlanta, for instance, saw 53 percent of their voters go for Democrats, up from 39 percent in 2016.\n\nThe left turn proved vital, knocking off Republican incumbents in suburban districts and seemingly blurring the boundary of Trump country. Analysts and Congressional leaders all but reclaimed the suburbs for Democrats following the election.\n\n\"We're delighted that suburbia, which used to be so Republican, is now Democratic,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday. He warned the suburban retreat, along with turnouts from women and minorities, should worry Republicans and President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\n\n\"Just as the rural vote revolt has continued to benefit Trump and Republicans, a new suburban revolt, especially among college-educated women, has worked to the benefit of the Democratic party and will probably continue,\" said Larry Sabato, founder and director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\nTake Republican-leaning Delaware County, Ohio, north of Columbus. A quarter of its votes went for Democrats in 2016, when Trump narrowly won the state. On Tuesday, that number jumped to 44 percent \u2013 a fluctuation of 19 percentage points. Morris County, New Jersey, sitting across the Hudson River from New York City, posted a 15-percentage-point increase for Democrats. DuPage County outside Chicago saw a 10 point change.\n\nThe trend persisted in suburbs across the country and in congressional districts that flipped from Republican to Democrat, contributing to the Democrats' new House majority.\n\nJennifer Wexton, who upset Republican incumbent Rep. Barbara Comstock, received a boost by 10-point gains in Fairfax and Loudoun, two suburban Virginia counties outside Washington, D.C. In Kansas, Sharice Davids defeated Republican Rep.

Some county numbers weren't yet available. In each of these counties or cities, at least 30 percent of the population has a college degree. In many cases, it's more than half. The areas have median household incomes of at least $62,000 or more, but often topping $100,000.\n\nA woman and her children vote at a polling station in Fairfax County, Virginia, on Tuesday.

They won outright in 60 of these areas, up from 39 in 2016.\n\nPolitical analysts see the trend as evidence that pragmatic suburban voters can't be typecast. Or, perhaps, they've grown weary of Trump's controversial comments and positions.\n\n\"They're put off by the harsh rhetoric of Trump on almost everything,\" Sabato explained. \"I have seen not only no softening toward Trump among the highly educated, I have seen an intensification of the anger, resentment and opposition to him.\"\n\nThe midterms exemplified how malleable suburban voters can be, said Sam Abrams, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who writes about political geography.\n\nOver the past two decades, while rural areas became more Republican and urban centers became more Democratic, the suburbs waffled. The bloc moved slightly to the left or right depending on the election, Abrams said.\n\n\"These folks are flippable, and that's what we saw here,\" he said. \"They're going to be retrospective voters. They're going to look at what what's going on and they're going to say, 'Are we happy with it? Are we comfortable with it?' \"\n\nMaking that group comfortable, both Sabato and Abrams say, should be a goal of both parties in 2020.\n\n\"The only competitive territory is the suburbs and the exurbs,\" Sabato said.\n\nContributing: Brad Heath\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/08/midterms-suburbs-republicans-democrats-trump/1921590002/", "CLOSE President Donald Trump turned the tables on his predecessors when he was asked about former first lady Michelle Obama criticizing him in her new memoir \"Becoming.\" USA TODAY\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama criticizes President Trump and talks about her relationship with her husband, former President Barack Obama, in her new book, 'Becoming.'

The 32-year-old, who hurt his shoulder on the final possession of Monday's loss in Orlando, went through his usual pregame workout, but was experiencing pain in his shoulder and couldn't play against the Thunder. Further medical tests performed Thursday revealed the sprain.\n\nHill's setback is yet another obstacle for the Cavs, who are an NBA-worst 1-10 and recently fired coach Tyronn Lue.

(AP) \u2014 David Moore tried his best not to let the final pass in Seattle's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers last week bother him for long.\n\nIt's not easy when it's a throw that could have potentially tied the game and forced overtime, but instead bounced off Moore's shoulder and fell incomplete on the final play of Seattle's 25-17 loss.\n\nIt was shown on seemingly every TV broadcast playing highlights of the game , and while it would have been an exceptionally difficult catch after getting tipped by a Chargers defensive back, Moore wishes he could have made the grab.\n\n\"I tried to stay away from it,\" Moore said on Thursday. \"After a while, I'd say Monday after meetings, I tried to watch it and then I was like, 'It's over with now. I'm on to (the Rams).'\"\n\nThe incompletion was the most difficult moment the second-year wide receiver has faced since becoming part of Seattle's wide receiver rotation. The Seahawks had an untimed down from the 6-yard line needing a touchdown and a 2-point conversion to force overtime.\n\nQuarterback Russell Wilson stepped up away from the pass rush and Moore had flashed open running across the back of the end zone.\n\nWilson zipped his pass in Moore's direction, but just a couple of yards away from finding the receiver's hands, the ball was tipped by the Chargers' Jahleel Addae. The tip slightly changed the trajectory of the pass and it started severely wobbling offline. Moore was unable to adjust his hands in time and the ball thudded off his shoulder pads and to the turf.\n\n\"I (saw) it get tipped. I saw the dude come across and I tried to adjust to it but it was a little bit too late,\" Moore said. \"It was a fastball coming in hot, getting touched, it's kind of hard to get your hands where it needs to be after that.\"\n\nMoore said he spent time Sunday night wondering if there are even drills to mimic having a pass change as that one did so close to the receiver.\n\n\"It's a really tough catch. He's tracking the ball, he sees it coming and all of a sudden the ball takes kind of a strange turn,\" Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer said. \"He was really dejected, really upset. Got a chance to talk to him after the game, said a lot of things still had to happen. That wasn't the reason we won or lost that game, but it was a very difficult play.\"\n\nMoore's development has been one of the big stories of the season for Seattle. His progression from an unknown seventh-round pick in 2017 to becoming the Seahawks' No. 3 receiver was so rapid Seattle felt comfortable releasing veteran Brandon Marshall last week to open a roster spot.\n\nWhile it wasn't a dropped pass, the final play is the first major adversity Moore has faced this season. He was emotional after the game, but said the moment was quickly put in perspective.\n\n\"At first I took it kind of hard, but then I had Doug (Baldwin) and Tyler (Lockett) and all the brothers and stuff, and all the coaches tell me stuff like this happens all the time,\" Moore said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Certainly, we want to play the game in a way that's compelling for our audience, including the younger audience,\" Halem said. \"We're constantly looking at the way the game is changing organically and trying to balance the competitive issues with our clubs and our GMs doing everything possible to win versus what those decisions result in in terms of the product on the field. And it's not an easy balance, but we work very hard at it.\"\n\nAgreement with the union is necessary for playing rules changes, but management has the right to unilaterally implement a new playing rule with one year advance notice. Commissioner Rob Manfred had the right to mandate pitch clocks for 2018 but backed off when the union refused to agree, and he retains the ability to order clocks for 2019.\n\nMLB did initiate limits on mound trips without pitching changes in 2018, and the average time of a nine-inning game dropped to 3 hours, 44 seconds during the regular season from 3:05:11 in 2017 \u2014 although it rose to 3:34:50 this postseason from 3:29:28 in 2017.\n\n\"It's going in the right direction,\" Halem said.\n\nNon-playing rules changes require agreement with players. Halem called the situation fluid, said he isn't certain when management and the union will meet and set spring training as the deadline to determine any actions.\n\nManfred has said the sport is examining whether it should attempt to manage the evolution of on-field play in an era when strikeouts topped hits for the first time in 2018 and the big league batting average dropped to its lowest level since 1972, the last season before the American League adopted the designated hitter. Strikeouts have set records for 11 straight years as more pitchers throw harder and teams more frequently bring in relievers.\n\n\"I think the commissioner has said we'd probably like to see more balls in the play,\" Halem said.\n\nThere was just one trade announced during the four-day session: Seattle acquired speedy outfielder Mallex Smith from Tampa Bay as part of a five-player trade that sent catcher Mike Zunino and outfielder Guillermo Heredia to the Rays.\n\nMost general managers said their focus is winning under the current rules.\n\n\"I just react to whatever's happening and do everything I can to try to put our team in position to score more runs than the other team,\" Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said. \"I can understand from a fan perspective the increase in strikeouts obviously then decreases the action in a game and how that can be something that's not landing well right now \u2014 and I totally appreciate that.\"\n\nAgent Scott Boras on Wednesday attributed the 4 percent attendance drop this year to the decisions by several teams to jettison veterans in favor of rebuilding \u2014 which cuts the money spent on contracts for players, including his clients.\n\n\"I certainly don't agree with that characterization,\" Halem said. \"I don't and our owners don't believe that there's any connection between the rebuilding process and overall attendance. There are a variety of reasons for our attendance numbers. We had poor weather,\"\n\nThere were 54 postponements, the most since 1989, and 26 were higher-drawing weekend games. Manfred said 35 games in April had a temperature of 40 degrees or less.\n\n\"A lot of people like the way the game is being played right now. Other people would like to see more balls in play,\" Halem said. \"So on any of these issues I don't think there's a right answer. And some of these trends may be cyclical, too, and will reverse themselves, because our clubs are very competitive, and as soon as one club starts doing something that's successful, reducing their strikeout rate as a team, for example, then other clubs follow.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota has a first team all-conference player coming back with Kenisha Bell, along with Big Ten Freshman of the Year award winner Destiny Pitts and four of the top five scorers from a team that finished 24-9 last season and won an NCAA Tournament game.\n\nWhen the Gophers start their schedule Friday night in front of a packed house, though, the fans will be most excited to see the head coach.\n\nLindsay Whalen will take the court with her new team in the opener against New Hampshire, one of the most-anticipated debuts in women's college basketball this year. Three months after announcing her retirement from the WNBA, Whalen has begun her full-time focus on the program she once helped build .\n\n\"I always hoped at some point I would work my way back here. You just don't know in what timing or in what capacity, so I'm just really thankful and really appreciative of the opportunity and the timing for it all to work out,\" Whalen said before practice Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Gophers, who were the first team to miss the cut in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 poll, have naturally been looking forward to this lid-lifter with more eagerness than usual.\n\nThe game on the elevated floor at 90-year-old Williams Arena was declared a sellout more than two weeks ago, with an expected crowd around 14,000. Though demand was boosted by steeply discounted tickets offered by the university to help spur sales, the heart of the buzz undoubtedly revolves around the beloved Whalen who first began putting fans in the seats 18 years ago as a freshman point guard who played with as much ferocity as flash.\n\nFour of the five largest crowds in program history came during Whalen's senior season, including the all-time record of 14,363 to see Penn State on Feb. 8, 2004.\n\n\"It always felt full, but to have that true sellout, it was just such a good memory and such an unbelievable feeling as a player that I'm just so excited that they get to experience that and they get to experience what it's like to play in this arena with all of its history,\" Whalen said. \"This is a place that, as a kid growing up in Minnesota, I just wanted to come and watch games here. I never dreamt that I would play here. So for me to have them get to experience this is really special.\"\n\nWith a Big Ten Player of the Year Award, a trip to the NCAA Final Four, four WNBA titles and two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. national team, Whalen has plenty of accomplishments with which to command respect from the players. There's no better way to build their trust, though, than with relatability.\n\n\"It's easy to talk to her for her to understand the things that we're going through as players,\" Bell said.\n\nFor some fun at the end of a recent practice, each player tried a half-court shot. They all missed. So Whalen stepped in.\n\n\"She was like, 'All right, let me just do it for you,\" Bell said. \"So she grabbed the ball and went to half court. Her first try, she made it.\"\n\nAlways the natural, that Whalen.\n\n\"When I played I was never going to be the fastest one or have the best jump shot, but I knew I was always going to be one of the toughest players in the gym no matter what,\" she said. \"I was going to do everything for my team to win. So I want us to have that edge and toughness where we're all in this together and are going to figure out a way to get this done.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Daniels is still working hard to become the elite passer many expected to see in his freshman season.

Daniels is determined to have a big finish that could still get USC back to the Pac-12 title game. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 J.T. Daniels is mentally and physically weary as he heads into the home stretch of his freshman season, which he realizes hasn't been the smashing success many Southern California fans anticipated.\n\nThe 18-year-old quarterback won't stop until he becomes the passer he knows he can be. He's still grinding and learning every day, from the practice field to the film room and back.\n\nWhen asked why he puts in so many hours of video study, Daniels shines a frank light on his skills and his determination to improve them.\n\n\"I'm not as good as someone like Sam Darnold, just to be straight-up,\" Daniels said this week after practice for the Trojans' (5-4, 4-3 Pac-12) visit from California (5-4, 2-4) on Saturday night.\n\n\"I can't do what a guy like Sam can do,\" Daniels added. \"For me, if I'm going to succeed, I know that I have to be the most prepared to know what's going to happen. I'm also not the tallest guy, so I can't see everything that's happening at all times. I just have to know, based off preparation and film study, who's going to be where, and I have to know where I've got to put the ball.\"\n\nDaniels arrived at USC several months ago amid fanfare and excitement for the next great quarterback in the Trojans' enviable lineage. After a phenomenal high school career in Orange County, he graduated a full year early to compete for Darnold's job, and he won it in training camp.\n\nWith three games left in the regular season, Daniels is eighth in the Pac-12 with 1,788 yards passing, and he has just nine touchdown passes against seven interceptions. His 125.2 passer rating is below every Pac-12 team's top passer except UCLA's Dorian Thompson-Robinson, and his 56.6 completion percentage is 13th in the league.\n\nDaniels' numbers are inextricable from the USC offense's struggles as a whole. Quarterbacks coach Bryan Ellis still sees every bit of Daniels' vast potential, even if the offense's performance hasn't reflected it yet.\n\n\"I think what he's learned is college football is a little faster and a little harder than he thought it was going to be,\" Ellis said. \"He learned that he's still a freshman, that we are still making freshman mistakes. We've learned we've got a long way to go. We've got a lot of work to do.\"\n\nDaniels was sidelined by a concussion last month at Utah, missing the rest of that defeat and a loss to Arizona State the following week. He returned for last week's win at Oregon State, and he didn't allow the injury to slow his weekly quest for constant improvement.\n\nHe hasn't cut down on his voracious film study, either.\n\n\"He's the hardest-working quarterback in the film room I've ever been around, and that's as an 18-year-old kid, which is really, really impressive,\" Ellis said. \"I think he just enjoys it. He's a football junkie. He knows that he's got some things to learn, some things to get better at, but he's doing it every day to get ready to be a really good quarterback.\"\n\nDaniels is far from the only USC offensive player with work to do. Last week, head coach Clay Helton took over the Trojans' play-calling and fired his offensive line coach, shaking up an underachieving unit that sits ninth in the Pac-12 in yards passing and 10th in yards rushing.\n\nDaniels is likely to be without key receiver Michael Pittman Jr. against the Golden Bears, adding another degree of difficulty to the Trojans' fall slate. After their crosstown showdown with UCLA at the Rose Bowl next week, USC finishes the regular season against No. 3 Notre Dame.\n\nThe Trojans could still reach the Pac-12 title game, or they could miss a bowl entirely with an 0-3 slump. Daniels' performances will have a big influence on that finish, and he is determined to play beyond his years.\n\n\"I guess I'm just so into it right now,\" Daniels said. \"You're coming into the home stretch and your body is tired, your mind is tired. You could really use a break, but you're not going to get a break. ... It's a big stage, but I'm doing my best. I really love the sport and love the game and love the team, so I'm still excited to come out every day.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 DeSean Jackson's frustration grows by the loss.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers have dropped five of six games following a 2-0 start, and the veteran receiver doesn't want anyone to buy the notion that all it'll take to make him happy is to catch more passes Sunday against the Washington Redskins.\n\nThe Bucs (3-5) haven't made the playoffs since 2007, and the only way to change that trend is to start winning.\n\nJackson, who signed with Tampa Bay as a free agent in 2017 after spending the previous three seasons with the Redskins, thinks he can make a difference. He fielded questions this week for the first time since he reportedly asked to be traded last month.\n\n\"Whatever them conversations were, they were between us,\" Jackson, when asked if he approached general manager Jason Licht before the Oct. 30 NFL trade deadline.\n\n\"It's over and done with now, and I'm looking forward,\" the five-time 1,000-yard receiver added. \"We've got eight games left to continue to try our best to get in the playoffs and win here.\"\n\nThe 11th-year pro has rebounded from a subpar debut with Tampa Bay a year ago to average 22.4 yards per reception in 2018.\n\nBut since beginning the season with consecutive 100-yard performances, that included TD catches of 58 and 75 yards in victories over New Orleans and Philadelphia, the 31-year-old's production has curtailed.\n\nThrough eight games, Jackson has 28 catches for 626 yards and four touchdowns, including a 60-yard scoring reception against Cincinnati that gave him the most TDs of 60-plus yards (24) in NFL history.\n\nAt the risk of sounding selfish, Jackson concedes he would like to be more involved in the offense. He began his career in Philadelphia, where he had three 1,000-yard seasons in six years. He had two in three seasons with the Redskins.\n\n\"It's just knowing what's in this locker room, knowing the players we have all across the board. ... That's been more of the frustration for me,\" Jackson said. \"It's not individual. It's more (about) accomplishing what we all want to accomplish.\"\n\nThe NFC East-leading Redskins (5-3) are coming off a lopsided loss to Atlanta that snapped a three-game winning streak.\n\nBouncing back on the road doesn't figure to be easy after losing three starters \u2014 receiver Paul Richardson and guards Brandon Scherff and Shawn Lauvao \u2014 to season-ending injuries against the Falcons.\n\nAlex Smith is coming off throwing for a season-best 306 yards last week, and coach Jay Gruden is counting on leading rusher Adrian Peterson's skill and experience to help him to adjust to changes of the offensive line and continue to be productive.\n\n\"He just goes through his reads like he normally would. It doesn't matter who's blocking for him \u2014 at guard, center, tackle, tight end, fullback ... or receiver,\" Gruden said. \"He's just going to go through his progressions and make his cuts and do what he does.\"\n\nSome things to know about the Redskins and Buccaneers:\n\nNICE TO MEET YOU\n\nAfter placing Scherff and Lauvao on injured reserve Monday because they need season-ending surgeries, and with left tackle Trent Williams recovering from an operation on his right thumb, the Redskins are putting together a makeshift offensive line. They signed three unemployed linemen \u2014 tackle Austin Howard, along with guards Jonathan Cooper and Luke Bowanko \u2014 and at least one is expected to start Sunday.\n\n\"The big thing, I think, is on the road, crowd noise, against a good D-line,\" Smith said. \"I think those things, all the calls, all the communication that has to take place \u2014 run, pass, third down \u2014 all the different looks, the thousands and thousands of reps that we've had \u2014 you try to condense into a few days to get ready.\"\n\nFITZMAGIC\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick will make his sixth start of the season at quarterback for the Bucs, who benched Jameis Winston after a road loss to Cincinnati two weeks ago. Tampa Bay has been outscored 103-27 in the first half of Fitzpatrick's past three starts \u2014 all losses.\n\nLike Smith, Fitzpatrick is in his 14th season. Smith was the first pick in the 2005 draft. Fitzpatrick was a seventh-round pick, No. 250 overall.\n\n\"He was 249 picks before I was,\" Fitzpatrick said, \"but we're both still here.\"\n\nCAN PETERSON BOUNCE BACK?\n\nPeterson entered this week fifth in the league in rushing with 604 yards at age 33, but he is coming off a poor game: He only ran nine times for 17 yards in the loss to Atlanta.

But when you've got guys coming at 100 mph, things change,\" Peterson said.\n\nNO COMEBACKS YET\n\nThe Redskins have not managed to win a game in which they've trailed this season. And during Gruden's 4\u00bd years in Washington, the team only has 15 come-from-behind victories; only five clubs have fewer in that span.\n\n\"That's something that we have got to do a better job of,\" Gruden said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Larry Fitzgerald is closing in on another milestone, and it's an impressive one.\n\nThe 35-year-old receiver needs to catch just 33 yards worth of passes Sunday at Kansas City to move past Hall of Famer Terrell Owens into second place on the NFL's all-time yards receiving list.\n\nAs usual, Fitzgerald brushed aside talk of the milestone in his weekly meeting with the media Thursday.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't really think about it,\" he said.\n\nModesty aside, there's no doubt that Fitzgerald is very aware of his place among the greats in the game.\n\nHalfway through his 15th season, Fitzgerald has 15,902 yards receiving, behind Owens' 15,934 and Jerry Rice's phenomenal 22,895.\n\nFitzgerald needs 58 catches to pass Tony Gonzalez for second on the NFL career receptions list. Fitzgerald has 1,268 catches to Gonzalez's 1,325 and Rice's 1,549.\n\nFitzgerald also is closing in on Rice's record for receptions with one team. Fitzgerald, who has spent his entire career with the Cardinals, needs 14 receptions to pass the 1,281 catches Rice had with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThere are numbers that Fitzgerald will talk about with pride, and that's what he's accomplished in the postseason.\n\nHe has 942 yards receiving in nine postseason games, most of any player in his first nine playoff contests. His three 150-yard playoff receiving games are most in NFL history. His five 100-yard games are tied for third all-time, behind Michael Irvin and Rice. Fitzgerald is tied for third in postseason TD receptions (10), behind John Stallworth and Rice. And Fitzgerald did it in only nine games.\n\nFitzgerald's performance in Arizona's surprise run to the Super Bowl in the 2008 season shattered NFL records for yards receiving (546), receptions (30) and touchdowns (7).\n\nIn Arizona's divisional game against Green Bay in 2015, Fitzgerald caught eight passes for 176 yards, including the two biggest plays of overtime. He is the only player in NFL history to average at least 100 yards receiving and a touchdown in every postseason game.\n\n\"I think every player wants to be at their best in the biggest moments,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I think my numbers in the playoffs say that I'm a guy who steps up in the bigger moments. I think that's something you look at the greats in history, the Jerry Rices and the Michael Jordans and the Kobe Bryants, the Reggie Jacksons of the world, those guys , when their teams needed them the most, they were able to find something to make a difference in the games.\"\n\nBut Fitzgerald may never appear in the playoffs again.\n\nThe Cardinals limp into Kansas City at 2-6 and Fitzgerald repeated Thursday that he hasn't decided whether this is his last season. It's hard to imagine him ever playing for another team.\n\nFitzgerald has been conspicuously absent from the statistics as the Arizona offense sputtered through seven games, leading to the firing of offensive coordinator Mike McCoy. With Byron Leftwich as the new coordinator, Fitzgerald had his best game of the year in the team's 18-15 victory over San Francisco two weekends ago, catching eight passes for 102 yards and a touchdown, just his second of the season.\n\nNotes: S Budda Baker, a critical component of Arizona's defense, did not practice Thursday due to a foot injury.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Nick Mullens remembers getting the phone call from Archie Manning inviting him to the prestigious Manning Passing Academy two summers ago.\n\nMullens savored the chance to take part in the four-day clinic run by Archie and his two NFL quarterback sons, Eli and Peyton. Mullens especially relished the opportunity to watch Eli Manning take part in some of the drills.\n\n\"To see how he moves in the pocket, he has very quick feet and is just very smooth,\" Mullens said. \"I definitely remember just sitting there and watching him throw. I took that all in.\"\n\nMullens now will get another chance to see Manning up close when he makes his second career start for the San Francisco 49ers (2-7) on Monday night against Manning and the New York Giants (1-7).\n\nMullens is coming off a scintillating debut, completing 16 of 22 passes for 262 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions for a 151.9 passer rating in a 34-3 victory over the Oakland Raiders. That's the highest rating since the merger for a player in his debut with at least 20 attempts.\n\nThings might not be as easy now that the Giants have an idea of what Mullens can do.\n\n\"I think they're going to be like, 'Oh crap. This guy is good,'\" running back Matt Breida said. \"I think they'll put more people back there to cover because of the throws he made and can do.\"\n\nWhile Mullens is just getting started, Manning is nearing the end of his career as he plays his 15th season for a team that is struggling mightily. New York has lost five straight games and the questions are mounting about how much longer the two-time Super Bowl MVP Manning has as quarterback.\n\n\"I think there's urgency to get things going, for sure,\" Manning said. \"We got to get some wins. We got to get going, and everybody wants it. The team needs it, for the morale and for just the hard work and everything we put in. Just need to reap the benefits of the work, and feel good about what we're doing.\"\n\nHere are some other things to watch:\n\nSPLENDID SAQUON\n\nRookie Saquon Barkley has been a rare bright spot for the struggling Giants, topping 100 yards from scrimmage in seven of his first eight games. Barkley has been a bit hit and miss with 16 runs for negative yards, tied for fifth worst in the league, and 11 plays that gained at least 20, which is tied for second most among running backs. Barkley is just the ninth player to gain at least 1,000 yards from scrimmage in the first eight games of his rookie season.\n\n\"I'm not one of those guys that says, let me see my stats, let me see how much I ran for this or that. I just play,\" he said. \"I'm not going to stand here and lie, I am very active on social media, so there's fan pages of me and I can go on Instagram or even on my explore page and they just happen to pop up. I've seen predictions of what I'm capable of doing, but it means nothing to me.\"\n\nPRESSURE POINT\n\nThe struggling pass rush for the 49ers broke through in a big way last week with eight sacks against Oakland. Cassius Marsh led the way with a career-best 2 \u00bd, and Dekoda Watson had 1 1/2 in his first game after coming off IR. San Francisco had eight sacks in a game only once in the previous two decades, doing it against the Rams in 2009.\n\nKITTLE'S CATCHES\n\nSan Francisco tight end George Kittle has been a big-play threat all season. He had a 71-yard catch and run last week against the Raiders, making him the first tight end since Rich Caster in 1972 to have two 70-yard catches in the same season. Kittle ranks second among all tight ends with 692 yards receiving and is second to Barkley among all players with 496 yards after the catch.\n\nSTRUGGLING FRANCHISES\n\nTwenty-eight years after these franchises met in the best matchup in \"Monday Night Football\" history, they now play in one of the worst. Back in 1990, the 49ers beat the Giants 7-3 in a matchup of 10-1 teams that provided the highest winning percentage ever for a Monday night game played after Halloween. The teams come into this meeting with a combined winning percentage of .176, the second lowest for a Monday night game played Nov. 1 or later. The lowest combined winning percentage is .167 for a matchup of the New York Jets (3-9) and the Chargers (1-11) in 1975 that featured Hall of Fame QBs Joe Namath and Dan Fouts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The 49ers are sticking with Nick Mullens as their starting quarterback after his spectacular debut performance. Mullens said coach Kyle Shanahan told him Tuesday, NOv. 6, 2018, that he will remain the starter for the upcoming game against the New York Giants. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Nick Mullens knows how to make a good first impression.\n\nWhether it was wearing a suit to his pre-draft interview with the San Francisco 49ers or setting records in his NFL debut, Mullens has proven that he can get off on the right foot in a new situation.\n\nNow the key for Mullens heading into his second start for the 49ers (2-7) on Monday night against the New York Giants will be building on the big performance he had last week against the Oakland Raiders to earn that second chance.\n\nInstead of getting rushed into action on a short week with no real practice, Mullens gets the benefit of a full week of work with his teammates as he tries to match the three-touchdown performance in a 34-3 win over the Raiders last Thursday night.\n\n\"He doesn't have to cram everything in in a day and a half,\" coach Kyle Shanahan said Thursday. \"He's got the whole week to kind of let it saturate, learn the play calls, spit them out easier, gets to throw some full-speed balls to all our players where last week there wasn't one full-speed rep. I think it helps prepare him more and makes him more comfortable going into the game.\"\n\nMullens has felt comfortable ever since joining the Niners. He impressed people by dressing up for the interview and even though he went undrafted out of Southern Mississippi, he showed enough to stick around last year on the practice squad.\n\nMullens kept working hard, knowing the offense as well as anyone and improving at working under center after spending so much time in college in the shotgun that he had to watch YouTube videos to teach himself how to drop back properly.\n\n\"He worked as hard as anyone last year and he played scout team safety all last year,\" Shanahan said. \"We spent most of last year this time messing with him on how bad his backpedal looked and things like that, on tape. But, he was a guy who just, he knew he had to do that, that's how the league works. You don't have enough guys to practice and he didn't just sit there and mope about it because I get how people could because it isn't a fair situation. But, he found ways to work on his own, to grab guys after, to go out late at night and do stuff. He's obsessed with getting better and he's needed the time to do it and it helped him get ready for last week.\"\n\nThat hard work paid off when Mullens got his first chance to play in a game when C.J. Beathard was hampered by a sore right wrist.\n\nMullens completed 16 of 22 passes for 262 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions for a 151.9 passer rating last week. That's the highest since the merger for a player in his debut with at least 20 attempts.\n\nMullens also joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly (1986) and Fran Tarkenton (1961) as the only QBs to throw for at least 250 yards and three touchdowns without throwing an interception in their NFL debuts.\n\nThat made it an easy call to give Mullens a second start this week, although Shanahan said he will evaluate the quarterbacks on a week-to-week basis.\n\n\"I don't think it was too tough of a decision,\" Shanahan said. \"Our team played really well and he played well. It was going to be hard to not give him the opportunity.\"\n\nAbout the only time Mullens got flustered was when Shanahan kept talking after relaying the play call into Mullens' helmet. Mullens got frustrated enough that teammates said he told Shanahan to quiet down even though the helmet offers only one-way communication.\n\nThat ended up amusing his teammates and lightening the mood in the huddle.\n\n\"Sometimes in the huddle, you hear the play call and you're ready to repeat it ...,\" Mullens said. \"I was just ready to call the play.\"\n\nShanahan joked that Mullens will have to yell at him louder if he wants his coach to hear him on the sideline but he understands the frustration.\n\n\"That's always the dilemma for coaches and quarterbacks. It's funny because I know if I was a quarterback and someone was yelling in my ears, I would handle it much worse than those guys would,\" Shanahan said. \"I struggle. I've almost gotten in trouble with head coaches for saying the wrong thing when you're trying to think and make a play call and someone's yelling in your ear, it's hard to think.\"\n\nNOTES: LB Reuben Foster (hamstring) and S Jaquiski Tartt (shoulder) didn't practice and will be questionable this week. ... WR Pierre Garcon (knee) and LT Joe Staley (veteran's day) also didn't practice. ... The 49ers promoted DB Greg Mabin to the active roster from the practice squad and signed CB Tarvarus McFadden to the practice squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Things take a twisted turn when they discover an underground lab. USA TODAY\n\nJust when you think the scary movie season is over, here comes a bunch of undead Nazi experiments to liven up the box office.\n\nDirected by Julius Avery (\"Son of a Gun\") and produced by J.J. Abrams, \"Overlord\" (in theaters Friday) is a two-fisted, flame-throwing World War II action-adventure horror film set in June 1944 that follows a bunch of American paratroopers on their most deadly mission yet: taking on a secret German lab in a French village church that's ground zero for unstoppable zombies and other misshapen creatures.\n\nWe know you might have a few burning questions about \u201cOverlord,\u201d so here are some (mostly) helpful answers.\n\nBoyce (Jovan Adepo) investigates horrifying Nazi experiments in the World War II horror action film \"Overlord.\" (Photo: PETER MOUNTAIN)\n\nWhat's the backstory on this movie?\n\nBecause it was a secretive project from Abrams' Bad Robot production company, a lot of people assumed it was the next \"Cloverfield\" movie. It is not, though this could conceivably be the same film universe that's invaded by rampaging alien monsters decades later.\n\nWhat's the least we need to know going in?\n\nThe night before D-Day, a group of G.I.s \u2013 including the very green private Boyce (Jovan Adepo) and explosives expert Ford (Wyatt Russell) \u2013 are dropped into occupied France to knock out a Nazi radio tower so their boys on the beaches at Normandy can get enough air support. What they find, though \u2013 with the help of local French woman Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier) \u2013 is that the Nazis are using a serum to turn dead villagers and others into hard-to-kill, super-strong zombies. Heroism ensues.\n\nWyatt Russell stars as explosives expert Ford in \"Overlord.\" (Photo: PETER MOUNTAIN)\n\nIs it historically accurate in any way?\n\nWell, D-Day actually happened, so there's that. Nazis also did horrific experiments on people and Hitler was interested in the occult, which has inspired everything from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" to the video game \"Wolfenstein.\"\n\nThat Wyatt Russell dude looks familiar. What's his deal?\n\nGlad you asked: He's the rising-star son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, who's appeared in \"22 Jump Street,\" \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" and \"Black Mirror.\" He's shown shades of his action-hero dad a little here and there, but \"Overlord\" has some scenes that prove the Russell swagger is definitely genetic. (And like his father, he has a knack for macho one-liners.)\n\nIain De Caestecker co-stars as war photographer Chase in \"Overlord.\" (Photo: PETER MOUNTAIN)\n\nWho else is in this movie we might know?\n\nAdepo is a British actor who starred opposite Denzel Washington in \"Fences,\" and he was also a regular on \"The Leftovers.\" John Magaro, who plays American soldier Tibbet, had roles in \"The Big Short\" and \"Carol,\" while Marvel fans know Iain De Caestecker (as war photographer Chase) as Leo Fitz from \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" And Pilou Asbaek, who co-stars as primary Nazi villain Wafner, is best known as Euron Greyjoy from \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nWhat does \"Overlord\" add to the zombie-movie genre?\n\nThese aren't your usual shambling types. These guys are superpowered and more like the freaky fast zombies from \"28 Days Later,\" all quick and twitchy and a pain to get rid of since headshots don't automatically eliminate some of them.\n\nPilou Asbaek co-stars as main Nazi antagonist Wafner in \"Overlord.\" (Photo: PETER MOUNTAIN)\n\nHow gory is this thing?\n\nLet's put it this way: The new \"Halloween\" is like a Pixar film in comparison. There's lots of war death (heads and limbs blown off) and buckets of blood, yet also some seriously effective body horror, as one dude in particular is resurrected in all his bone-popping glory. Then there's Wafner who gets half his face blown off and turns into a creepy supervillain. (When the serum gets put in a living person, look out.)\n\nBut does it overtake 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in terms of creative Nazi deaths?\n\nThat's a high bar, guys. There's one scene involving a grenade and a place it doesn't belong that's cool, plus plenty of Germans torn up by bullets, yet nothing comes close to the unholy face-melting of \"Raiders.\"\n\nChloe (Mathilde Ollivier) takes flamethrower to a zombie in \"Overlord.\" (Photo: PETER MOUNTAIN)\n\nIs this OK for my kids to see?\n\nNope. Teenagers into video games will probably really want to see it, however. (Ask your mom and dad first, youngsters!)\n\nSo is the movie any good?\n\nIt helps to be in the mood for a period Nazi zombie shoot-'em-up but it's very successful at being a bit of fun and bloody counterprogramming. It offers plenty of black humor with grindhouse style and sensibility, on-point jump scares, hyperrealistic wartime action, and the kind of gritty period vibe that would be perfect for a modern-day \"Indiana Jones\" reboot.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/09/your-10-burning-questions-wwii-zombie-horror-film-overlord/1927189002/"]
