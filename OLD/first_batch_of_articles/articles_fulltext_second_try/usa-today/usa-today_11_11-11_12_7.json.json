He was one of the festival's founding company members and spent 32 seasons performing there, until 1998.\n\nHis roles at Stratford included playing Claudio in \"Measure for Measure\" in 1954, Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\" in 1957, Edgar in \"King Lear\" in 1964 and Prince Hal in \"Henry IV, Part 1\" in 1958, a play and a role he would return to in 1965. He would eventually take on the title role in 1966.\n\nBut it was the aloof voice of the artificially intelligent HAL 9000 \u2013 the forerunner of today's Amazon's Alexa or Google Home \u2013 where Rain entered the public's consciousness. Kubrick had heard Rain's voice in the 1960 documentary \"Universe,\" a film he watched multiple times, according to the actor. Rain was initially hired to narrate 1968's \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" but the director chose to go a different direction.\n\nHAL is the onboard master computer on the spaceship Discovery 1 but goes rogue. When astronaut Dave Bowman asks HAL to open the ships' pod doors, HAL famously balks. \"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that,\" the machine blandly refuses. \"This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.\"\n\nActor Keir Dullea peers through his space helmet in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" (Photo: Associated Press)\n\nMore: '2001: A Space Odyssey': Book celebrates 50th anniversary of sci-fi movie masterpiece\n\nMore: In 1968, '2001' tried to predict the future. Here's what it got right.\n\nWhen the astronauts try to disconnect HAL, he fights back. During his shutdown, HAL sings the nursey rhyme \"Daisy Bell\" and memorably utters: \"I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it.\" The American Film Institute named HAL the 13th greatest movie villain of all time, joining a list that includes Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader.\n\nStratford Festival Artistic Director Antoni Cimolino called Rain one of Canada's greatest acting talents and a \"guiding light in its development.\" He said the actor's humanity shone through in HAL.\n\n\"Douglas shared many of the same qualities as Kubrick's iconic creation: precision, strength of steel, enigma and infinite intelligence, as well as a wicked sense of humor,\" Cimolino said. \"But those of us lucky enough to have worked with Douglas soon solved his riddle and discovered that at the center of his mystery lay warmth and humanity, evidenced in his care for the young members of our profession.\"\n\nRain attended the University of Manitoba and studied in London at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He started out performing radio plays. From 1974 to 1977, Rain was head of the English acting section of the National Theatre School of Canada.\n\nRain performed at theaters and festivals all over Canada, including the Shaw Festival, where he played such roles as Caesar in \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" in 1983. He shared stages with such luminaries as Peter Ustinov, Maggie Smith and Colm Feore. He was nominated for a Tony Award in 1972 for his role as William Cecil in \"Vivat! Vivat! Regina!\" His other Broadway credits include \"The Golden Age\" in 1963 and \"The Broken Jug\" in 1958.\n\nRain is survived by his two sons, David and Adam, daughter Emma, granddaughter, Salima, and a daughter-in-law, Asira.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/12/actor-douglas-rain-voice-hal-2001-space-odyssey-dies/1983482002/", "Shohei Ohtani hit 22 home runs as a rookie in 2018.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Oakland coach Jon Gruden said he should take the blame for Derek Carr's bewildering fourth-down throwaway that ended any slim chance of a Raiders comeback.\n\nCarr's decision to throw the ball at the feet of running back Jalen Richard when no one was open on a fourth-and-5 play in the fourth quarter of a 20-6 loss Sunday to the Los Angeles Chargers summed up Oakland's fifth straight loss.\n\nCarr rolled right on the play looking for Richard in the flat. But with Melvin Ingram chasing him, Carr just threw the ball away rather than give any of his receivers even a chance at making a play.\n\n\"It was a terrible call by me,\" Gruden said Monday. \"It was a design for Jalen Richard against man-to-man coverage. There wasn't a lot (Carr) could have done. He could have been Fran Tarkenton and done a 360 and reversed the field a few times. There wasn't much there. You got to credit the play caller with that outcome.\"\n\nThe Raiders (1-8) were probably hurt more by another fourth-down call on the opening drive. Gruden decided to go for it from the 1 and used a play other teams had success running on the Chargers in the past.\n\nReceiver Dwayne Harris came across the formation to take a shovel pass from Carr, but was unable to get to the edge because of missed blocking assignments. Harris was stopped for no gain and the Raiders didn't get into the end zone.\n\n\"Once again, it was not a very good play call because it didn't work,\" Gruden said. \"A lot of people are running that play, as you know, in the tight red zone for obvious reasons. My first time using it wasn't a great experience.\"\n\nVery little has been great for the Raiders this season as they are off to the third-worst start in franchise history, trailing only the 0-10 mark in Carr's rookie season of 2014 and an 0-13 mark in 1962 \u2014 one year before Al Davis joined the franchise as coach and then owner.\n\nThe stretch the Raiders are currently on is as bad as any they've had in 59 seasons as a professional team. They have lost five straight by at least 14 points for the first time ever and are one 14-point loss shy of tying the single-season record for the most by any team since the merger.\n\nOakland has been outscored 75-9 in the past nine quarters and was held without a TD in consecutive games for the first time since 2012.\n\n\"I know it's dark right now,\" Gruden said. \"It's tough. It's tough on our fans. I thank our fans for showing up and being with us. We're going to bring this thing back. I've been a part of it before and we've got some great people to build around. We've got some resources to keep building. I'll leave it at that.\"\n\nThe Raiders will go ahead with some key injuries at receiver with Martavis Bryant out with an injured PCL in his knee. Jordy Nelson also hurt his knee and his status for this week remains unknown. Oakland already traded away No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper, leaving Brandon LaFell and Seth Roberts as the team's top two options.\n\nThose injuries could lead to an opportunity for rookie Marcell Ateman, who was promoted from the practice squad last month but hasn't had a chance to play yet. Gruden also said he might bring in some receivers this week to try out.\n\nThe Raiders won't be getting a boost from defensive tackle Eddie Vanderdoes, who was placed on season-ending injured reserve Monday when he was unable to come back from knee surgery. Vanderdoes tore his ACL in the final game of the 2017 season and began this year on the physically unable to perform list after a setback in training camp.\n\nHe spent the past three weeks practicing but the team determined it was best to let him rest up for next year.\n\n\"We expected him to be ready in camp,\" Gruden said. \"I think right now it's not 100 percent. He hadn't had enough padded practices and been in the trenches enough to activate him, perhaps reinjuring that. I think it's the wise thing to do. We will try to move forward without him and get him healthy for next year.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But we\u2019ve seen the coaching staff in Tampa change its mind before, and if the Bucs aren\u2019t contending by December, maybe they give Winston a chance again to prove he\u2019s not a bust. His future matchups include games against the 49ers, Panthers and Saints. If you have room on your bench and you\u2019re streaming quarterbacks this year, he might help.\n\n4. TE Hunter Henry, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nESPN reported his return from a torn ACL is a \u201clongshot.\u201d But you know the tight end position is terrible this year, so why not take a chance and stash a player who caught eight touchdowns two years ago?\n\n5.

So that's something I need to work on, and that's going to be one of my goals, to stay healthy for a long full season and be able to the team win from day one.\"\n\nAtlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. was a runaway choice for the NL honor over Washington outfielder Juan Soto in a contest between 20-year-olds.\n\nA singular sensation who earned a chorus of praise for his dual success, Ohtani became the first player since Ruth in 1919 with 10 homers and four pitching wins in the same season.\n\nHe didn't play between June 4 and July 3 because of a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, an injury the Angels were aware of when they signed him for a $2,315,000 bonus last winter. The 24-year-old right-hander made just one more mound appearance, on Sept. 2, and three days later the team said a scan revealed additional damage and surgery was recommended.\n\nOhtani appeared in 22 more games as a hitter, had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1 and hopes to be able to help the Angels at the plate next season. He probably won't take the mound again until 2020.\n\n\"Everything's going well,\" he said. \"We're right on schedule, maybe even a little ahead.\"\n\nOhtani, who left the Nippon Ham Fighters to play in the major leagues, received 25 first-place votes and four seconds for 137 points from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. New York Yankees third baseman Miguel Andujar was second with five firsts and 89 points, and Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres was next with 25 points.\n\nOhtani was 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA and 63 strikeouts over 51 2/3 innings in 10 starts. As a designated hitter, he batted .285 with 22 homers and 61 RBIs and a .925 OPS in 367 plate appearances.\n\n\"Of course, getting hurt is never a good thing,\" he said. \"I was able to fight through it.\"\n\nHe is the first Japanese player to win a rookie honor since Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki in 2001 and the fourth overall, joining the Dodgers' Hideo Nomo in 1995 and Seattle's Kazuhiro Sasaki in 2000. Ohtani became the first player with 15 homers as a batter and 50 strikeouts as a pitcher in the same season.\n\nAcuna received 27 first-place votes and three seconds for 144 points. Soto got two firsts and 89 points, and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Walker Buehler was next with one first and 28 points.\n\nAcuna, in Japan with a major league All-Star team, declined to participate in a morning conference call about the vote, BBWAA secretary-treasurer Jack O'Connell said.\n\nAcuna started the season at Triple-A and made his debut on April 25, the youngest player in the majors then at 20 years, 128 days. The Venezuelan hit .293 with 26 homers, 64 RBIs and 16 steals with a .917 OPS. He set a Braves record with eight leadoff homers this season and tied a franchise mark by homering in five straight games from Aug. 11-14.\n\nSoto debuted on May 20 at 19 years, 207 days, although in a quirk the Dominican is credited with a home run from five days before his debut \u2014 he went deep on June 18 against the New York Yankees in the completion of the May 15 suspended game.

When you get him, he's special.\"\n\nThough Latavius Murray has 439 total yards and five touchdowns over the past five games, Cook's return will be vital toward continuing the revival of a running game that ranks 28th in the league with an average of 91.7 yards per game.\n\nThe Vikings (5-3-1) play at NFC North-leading Chicago (6-3) on Sunday night in a game for control of the division. That's one of three games over the next four for the Vikings that will be on the road and outdoors in northern cities.\n\n\"I do think with some of these games as it starts to get colder, it is going to be more of a factor,\" coach Mike Zimmer said. \"I think we're getting better at a lot of the areas in the running game. We have to continue searching for more ways to pound the ball.\"\n\nWhen Cook was healthy in the season opener against San Francisco, the Vikings had 116 rushing yards. They then went four straight games with fewer than 20 rushing attempts and 77 rushing yards or fewer, until Murray produced a 155-yard performance on 24 carries in a victory over Arizona on Oct. 14 .\n\nCook and Murray combined for 120 rushing yards against the Lions. The Vikings have averaged 124 rushing yards over the past four games, up from 65.8 yards per game on the ground over the first five weeks.\n\n\"He has got a chance to hit home runs,\" Zimmer said of Cook. \"I think it was really good for him to get out there and get some game time action. When you haven't played in six weeks and you haven't practiced all that much, I think he will continue to get better.\"\n\nThe Vikings also claimed running back Ameer Abdullah last week after he was waived by the Lions. Abdullah, a second-round draft pick in 2015, only appeared in three games this year and carried the ball once. He averaged 3.8 yards per attempt in three seasons as the primary ball carrier, when he wasn't injured, before being replaced by rookie Kerryon Johnson this season.\n\n\"I'm entering a backfield with a lot of talent, Dalvin, we have Latavius and all the guys who've been here,\" Abdullah said after practice on Monday. \"Just coming in today and seeing these guys welcome me the way they have has been amazing for me. It does a lot for my confidence. It does a lot for my focus.\"\n\nAbdullah will also be an option as a kickoff returner.\n\n\"I'm ready to work,\" he said. \"Anything the Vikings ask me to do, I'm willing to do just because I'm so appreciative of the opportunity.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

His ejection was automatic because it was his second unsportsmanlike penalty \u2014 each player on both teams had been assessed one following the earlier melee.\n\n\"Charlie is a competitor and he is trying to get a first down and he has to watch the rest of the game from the locker room.

(AP) \u2014 Although the Arizona Cardinals went down to their seventh defeat of the season, there were positive aspects to their 26-14 loss at Kansas City.\n\nDavid Johnson broke loose for his best game of the year and the Cardinals defense harassed Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes better than anyone has all season.\n\nJohnson, who had been bottled up through the first half of the season as part of the worst-ranked offense in the NFL, accumulated 183 yards from scrimmage \u2014 98 yards rushing (in 21 carries) and 85 yards receiving (on seven catches).\n\nJohnson scored both of Arizona's touchdowns, on a nine-yard pass from Josh Rosen and a one-yard run.\n\n\"It felt good,\" Johnson said after the game. \"Like I was saying, it made me feel like it was back to ... the 2016 offense. We got some momentum going as an offense running the ball. We got some good confidence going as well.\"\n\nIt was the second game for Arizona with Byron Leftwich as offensive coordinator.\n\n\"I thought it was a great game plan by the offensive coaches,\" coach Steve Wilks said in his weekly Monday news conference. \"I thought Byron did a tremendous job calling the game and getting into the flow and rhythm of the game. As we all have seen \u2014 and you guys have been here before myself \u2014 what David is capable of doing. We saw that with some hard runs inside the tackles and did some good things getting outside as well as in the pass game. I thought Byron did a tremendous job in just really trying to get him the ball.\"\n\nJohnson has topped 100 yards from scrimmage in each of the past two games after failing to do so in the first seven of the season.\n\n\"It means that we are moving in the right direction,\" Wilks said. \"It means that we're evolving on the offensive side of the ball. We came into this game talking about trying to steal some possessions and trying to keep those guys off the field. We did that by sustaining drives \u2014 a 14-play drive and starting the third quarter with a 13-play drive, and they both ending in touchdowns. Where we came up short was the consistency after that, not being able to get back into the end zone.\"\n\nArizona used up 6:01 in its first touchdown drive and 7:12 in the second.\n\nThe Cardinals had the ball down 26-20 and Rosen's 23-yard pass to Johnson put the ball on the Arizona 40 early in the fourth quarter. But Rosen's screen pass, intended for Johnson, was intercepted by Justin Houston at the Cardinals 35. That led to a Kansas City touchdown. After that, Rosen was battered behind some shaky pass protection as Arizona was forced to mainly abandon the run.\n\nOn defense, poor play in the Arizona secondary led to a quick Kansas City touchdown on the game's first possession. But the Cardinals were tough after that, sacking Mahomes five times \u2014 two by Chandler Jones. Mahomes had never been sacked more than twice in a game before Sunday.\n\n\"I thought the D-line did a tremendous job of staying in their rush lanes,\" Wilks said. \"Coverage-wise, I thought those guys at times when we were able to get to him, he was holding the ball. So, we did a good job complementing one another. Then there were times we just pressured him. It was great to be able to get to him five times. I just wish we could have come up with some takeaways.\"\n\nThe 26 points were a season low for Kansas City.\n\nIt might have been about as good as the Cardinals could have expected on the road against the Chiefs, who improved to 9-1.\n\n\"There are no moral victories in this game,\" Wilks said. \"We went to Kansas City to win a football game, and we came up short. Now, there are a lot of things we can build off to get better. It was very encouraging, some of the things you saw on both sides of the ball, as well as in special teams, and that's what we are going to continue to try to do.\"\n\nThe Cardinals will find themselves in the unusual position of being favored on Sunday when they host the Oakland Raiders.\n\nNotes: Wilks said he hadn't received the results of an MRI on right guard Justin Pugh's injured knee.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Michael Woods) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Although LSU cannot win the Southeastern Conference championship, victories in its next two games will result in a regular season that exceeded expectations by a wide margin.\n\nThe 10th-ranked Tigers need to beat Rice this Saturday and Texas A&M in College Station the following week for their first 10-win regular season since 2012. That probably also would put LSU in a New Year's Six Bowl.\n\nSo while coach Ed Orgeron hoped the Tigers could contend for a championship, he doesn't want to downplay the improvement he's seen in the program, which was ranked 25th in the preseason poll and climbed as high as fourth before sliding back on the heels of a loss to No. 1 Alabama.\n\n\"This team wanted to win a national championship,\" Orgeron said. \"But, we never set that as a goal for this team. This is LSU. I know the expectations. We are getting the most out of this football team. We still have two tough games to go. Going to a New Year's Day bowl would be a good step.\"\n\nThe Tigers did enough to defeat Arkansas 24-17 last Saturday. LSU squandered much of a 21-point advantage in the fourth quarter before running out the clock to preserve its eighth victory of the year.\n\n\"We have to finish the game,\" Orgeron said. \"I was disappointed that we did not finish the game strong.\"\n\nFor the first time since the Ole Miss game in late September, quarterback Joe Burrow threw a touchdown pass \u2014 a 40-yarder to Justin Jefferson. However, for the fifth consecutive game, Burrow failed to throw for more than 200 yards.\n\nMoreover, the Tigers have had just one back rush for more than 100 yards in that five-game span. Clyde Edwards-Helaire ran for 145 yards in LSU's 36-16 victory against Georgia.\n\n\"We have lost our identity on offense,\" Oregeron said. \"We have been trying some new things. Maybe we have put too much in. We may need to simplify.\"\n\nOrgeron said he told offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger, \"Let's look at what we did vs. Georgia. Are we covering up for some of our weaknesses? Is it that we can't have enough receivers out in routes because of (pass) protection?\"\n\nThis season was expected to be a rebuilding year, largely because LSU's offense entered the season with only three returning starters: tight end Foster Moreau, left tackle Saahdiq Charles and left guard Garrett Brumfield. LSU lost a fourth returning starter when right guard Ed Ingram was suspended indefinitely before the start of practice.\n\nCharles and Brumfield have missed a combined eight games. Those two players have been together on the starting offensive line just four times.\n\n\"The offensive line has played good, but we have not been consistent,\" starting center Lloyd Cushenberry said. \"It's a little mixture of everything. Sometimes things happen in football. Coming into the season, people thought we were going get demolished in every game. We have done well.\n\n\"Getting to a New Year's Six bowl game would be huge for this team,\" Cushenberry added. \"People outside the team didn't think we were going to be good this year. They thought we would win just six games. We have a chance to prove ourselves right and that they were wrong.\"\n\nLSU is a 40-plus point favorite over a one-win Rice team. The Tigers will have a greater challenge when they close the regular season at Texas A&M.\n\n\"Our target this week is Rice and nothing else,\" Orgeron said. \"Our focus is to be 9-2 at the end of the week. Getting to a New Year's bowl is really important for the players. We have talked about finishing strong. We have to play well this week and play well next week.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And I wasn\u2019t alone. Marvel Comics, the publisher of Amazing Spider-Man, Fantastic Four and a new wave of strikingly different comic books, became the comics company of choice for an entire generation.\n\nMost of the credit for that goes to Stan Lee, for decades Marvel\u2019s top writer and editor, who died this morning at age 95.\n\nStan Lee reinvented the industry, and himself\n\nStan Lee\u2019s approach was revolutionary. His super-heroes were real people with real problems who happened to be employed saving the universe. Peter Parker was an angst-filled teen-age science student when he was a bitten by a radioactive spider. After that, he could climb walls, but bullying and girl problems could not be solved with super-strength.\n\nSo the Marvel Universe was born, populated with singular heroes with singular stories. The Hulk was a scientist transformed by radiation (a lot of that going on in the \u201860s.) Thor\u2019s alter-ego was a doctor who came across a magical walking stick. The Fantastic Four were empowered by cosmic rays, but had to fend off bankruptcy and civil litigation.\n\nMost notable about Lee\u2019s success was that he had already been in the comics business for almost a quarter-century. He reinvented the industry and himself at the same time.\n\nJack Kirby (co-creator of the Hulk and Fantastic Four) and Steve Ditko (the co-creator of Spider-Man) were giants in the field, but Lee\u2019s fingerprints were everywhere, generating plots, creating new characters and playing the role of P.T. Barnum for millions of kids who followed him and his Merry Marvel Marching Society wherever he led.\n\nMore: We want a savior.

African-American Robbie Robertson emerged as a wise figure in the pages of Spider-Man. People with disabilities became heroes (Thor, Dr. Strange and Iron Man), though in thoroughly improbable ways.\n\n\u25ba We saw racial bias filtered through science-fiction, with the coming of the X-Men and mutants, and society\u2019s backlash. That theme has been developed by Marvel to even greater effect in the past decade.\n\nBut most of all, we read about decent people trying to change the world for the better. Of course, that\u2019s the theme of most heroic fiction, but somehow in Stan Lee\u2019s hands, it was that much more relatable.\n\nIt was gratifying to see Lee show up at comic book conventions in recent years and be treated as the creative giant he truly was.

(AP Photo/Frank Victores) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The dynamic Saints running back duo of Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara agree that the word \"savage\" best describes New Orleans' offense.\n\nCertainly, the Saints are scoring so often, and in so many ways, it's enough to bruise defenders' egos.\n\n\"I'm glad we don't have to play them,\" Saints linebacker Alex Anzalone said Monday, a day after New Orleans broke the 50-point mark in a victory over Cincinnati.\n\nEven by the lofty standards offensive-minded coach Sean Payton and record-setting quarterback Drew Brees have set since joining forces in 2006, New Orleans is putting points on the board with exceptional proficiency.\n\nThe Saints have never averaged better than 34.2 points per game for an entire season. That mark was set by New Orleans' 2011 squad that featured Brees and four skill players that each gained more than 950 yards from scrimmage: tight end Jimmy Graham, receiver Marques Colston, and running backs Darren Sproles and Pierre Thomas.\n\nThe 2018 Saints, who host defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia on Sunday, currently lead the NFL with an average 36.7 points through nine games. Maintaining that pace for the rest of the regular season would put them third all-time in scoring behind the 2013 Denver Broncos (37.9 points per game) and the 2007 New England Patriots (36.8). And the way the Saints are playing, their current scoring average could very well increase before the season is out. They've scored at least 40 points in five of nine games so far.\n\nThey've also added yet another potential receiving target, signing veteran Brandon Marshall on Monday.\n\n\"He's got good length and size. He's another big target,\" Payton said of the 34-year-old Marshall, who became a free agent when he was released by Seattle on Oct. 30. \"I thought size was important but (also) experience and someone that we felt had strong hands.\"\n\nEleven different Saints have gotten in the end zone this season, including Brees, who dove over the pile at the line of scrimmage for his third rushing TD this season during Sunday's 51-14 triumph at Cincinnati. The 39-year-old QB also is having one of his most efficient seasons, completing 77.3 percent of his passes for 21 TDs and only one interception.\n\nBrees' completion rate arguably has been aided by his decision to often throw shorter passes, particularly to Kamara, who has 55 receptions for 473 yards and three TDs. But Brees asserts that Saints' offensive production has stemmed in no small part from their ability to methodically sustain drives with high-percentage plays.\n\n\"It pays dividends as the game goes on,\" Brees said. \"You wear a defense down. ... We say, 'Don't get bored with the (short) completions, the four-yard runs. They result in big plays if we keep it up.\"\n\nA case in point is Brees' 72-yard game-breaking touchdown pass to receiver Michael Thomas in the final minutes of a Week 9 victory over the Los Angeles Rams, whose defenders crashed down to swarm Kamara on the play.\n\nDuring the Payton-Brees era, the Saints have more often than not been a pass-heavy team. But not this season. New Orleans ranks eighth in yards rushing and seventh in yards passing.\n\n\"We're hoping to have balance,\" Payton said. \"Our offensive line has played well. We've been consistent rushing the football. I feel like Drew's playing at high level. ... Having that ability to rush or pass is something that can help.\"\n\nAnd while Brees is in the twilight of his career, New Orleans is enjoying major production from two of its younger skill players.\n\nThe 23-year-old Kamara has 1,109 yards and 14 TDs from scrimmage on mix of runs and receptions. Thomas, 25, has caught 78 passes for 950 yards and seven TDs.\n\nSaints right tackle Ryan Ramczyk is in only his second NFL season, but said even he can see the Saints' offense is \"definitely special.\"\n\n\"The cohesiveness up front really helps us out. And then guys like Mark and Alvin and Drew, Michael \u2014 all those guys around us \u2014 are special athletes,\" Ramzcyk said. \"When we come together, we can make a lot of great things happen.\"\n\nAnd that takes a lot of pressure off the Saints' defense, which yielded 48 points in a season-opening loss, but since has been good enough to help New Orleans win eight straight. Next up are the Philadelphia Eagles (4-5).\n\n\"We don't have to be super heroes,\" Anzalone said. \"Things aren't going to always go our way, but we just have to give our offense a chance, and we've been able to do that these past eight games.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Dave Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 Previously concluded Financial Fair Play cases could be reopened, UEFA warned on Monday as evidence grows of Manchester City's attempts to disguise its source of income and spending.\n\nThe UEFA statement on the prospect of the financial compliance system being \"abused\" by teams comes after internal correspondence exposing City's alleged deception was published by European media outlets.\n\nThe reigning English Premier League champion and current leader has not provided a defense or disputed the authenticity of the information from leaked emails which reveal elaborate attempts over several years to try to avoid breaching the rules designed to curb overspending on player costs.\n\nCity, which has been owned by Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mansour for a decade, has already been punished for violating FFP after reaching a settlement agreement with UEFA in 2014 that saw it fined rather than banned from the Champions League.\n\nHaving spent more than a week declining to comment on the information in the \"Football Leaks\" documents, UEFA has issued a response to questions about City that raises the prospect of new sanctions.\n\n\"Should new information suggest that previously concluded cases have been abused, those cases may be capable of being re-opened as determined on a case by case basis,\" UEFA said. \"This approach is applied universally to all clubs that apply for a UEFA license and participate in European club competitions.\"\n\nThe agreement with UEFA eventually saw City forfeit only 20 million euros ($23 million) in Champions League prize money. UEFA has not said how aware it was in 2014 of City's plans to hide spending of more recent schemes, which have been reported in a five-part series by German magazine Der Spiegel.\n\n\"FFP is a framework which clubs that wish to play in UEFA competitions agree to abide by,\" the organizer of the Champions League and Europa League said in a statement. \"It relies on the cooperation of clubs to declare a complete and genuine financial position. While UEFA can test the information it receives, it relies on that information being fair and accurate reflections of a club's finances.\"\n\nThe title sponsor of City's stadium, training campus, and jersey backer is Etihad Airways, the state-owned airline from Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Mansour is a member of Abu Dhabi's royal family and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe leaks emails claimed to show in 2015 how the Etihad deal generated 67.5 million pounds annually for City. But City's holding company \u2014 state-backed Abu Dhabi United Group \u2014 channeled 59.9 million pounds back to Etihad, according to Jorge Chumillas, the club chief financial officer in an internal email.\n\nThe evidence could be significant for UEFA which checks clubs' finances annually to ensure they are meeting break-even requirements on a rolling three-year basis.\n\n\"This includes a thorough assessment of clubs' financial positions on the basis of both the information disclosed by the clubs (based on their independently audited financial statements) as well as a number of compliance checks and analysis undertaken by UEFA (including independent external audits),\" UEFA said. \"If new information comes to light that may be material to this assessment, UEFA will use that to challenge the figures and will seek explanation, clarification or rebuttal from the club concerned.\"\n\nAbu Dhabi United Group was also alleged to be sending cash to a shell vehicle which was created to supposedly buy the right to use players' images in marketing campaigns. This helped raise revenue by 30 million euros in one case cited by Der Spiegel, which reported City's emails from 2013.\n\nCity has not commented on its use of the Fordham Sports Management image rights company or attempts to shift costs away from the club.\n\nRoberto Mancini, who managed City from 2009-13 and won the Premier League in 2012, was also shown to have received more pay from a team Sheikh Mansour owns in Abu Dhabi than from the Manchester club. Der Spiegel shows Mancini signed two contracts at the same time, to receive a base salary of 1.45 million pounds from City and 1.45 million pounds and 1.75 million pounds for advising Al Jazira Sports.\n\nSince July 2011, UEFA has monitored the annual accounts of all clubs entering its two club competitions. The first period UEFA assessed clubs for compliance with FFP was 2011-13 when owners were allowed to cover losses up to 45 million euros.\n\nUEFA requires clubs to approach break-even on football-related business \u2014 television rights fees, buying and selling players, salaries, sponsor deals, tickets sales, prize money. The complex accounting rules encourage clubs to spend on long-term projects \u2014 stadiums, youth training \u2014 which do not count as losses for FFP purposes.\n\n\"Financial Fair Play has led to a step change in the health of the finances in European club football,\" UEFA said on Monday. \"Seven years ago, European clubs had a cumulative debt of 1.7 billion euros. Last year it was a profit of 600 million euros. Without question, it has been a success for the game across Europe.\"\n\nQatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain was sanctioned for overspending in 2014 at the same time as City. The Spanish soccer league last year asked UEFA to investigate City and PSG, claiming they benefit from state aid which \"distorts European competitions\" and \"is irreparably harming the football industry.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The Patriots have been adept at masking most of their issues this season.\n\nAfter a 1-2 start by New England that seemed to offer at least a sliver of opportunity for someone to end its streak of nine straight AFC East titles, it hushed those rumblings by running off six straight victories.\n\nBut recent injuries, mounting issues on the offensive line and mistakes on defense returned during a 34-10 loss at Tennessee on Sunday.\n\nIt left coach Bill Belichick with a refrain he repeated both after the game and again Monday when asked for his assessment.\n\n\"None of it was good enough,\" he said.\n\nIt's also brought back a small cloud of uncertainty about the prospects of a team that now enters its bye week facing the task of playing catch-up to a 9-1 Kansas City Chiefs team for home-field advantage in the AFC playoffs.\n\n\"You better learn from a game like this, because the weeks get harder and harder,\" receiver Julian Edelman said following Sunday's loss. \"We've got to fix it because this is when you start separating or you start falling behind.\"\n\nTom Brady put together an MVP season in 2017 despite losing Edelman to a preseason knee injury. He was able to do it largely because of the strong seasons from tight end Rob Gronkowski, running back Dion Lewis and receiver Brandin Cooks.\n\nAnd despite a slow start, the defense was strong down the stretch, ending the regular season allowing just 18.5 points per game.\n\nFast-forward to 2018 and so much has changed following roster changes in the offseason.\n\nLewis signed with the Titans in free agency, creating a hole at running back that the Patriots have had trouble plugging. Cooks was traded and Brady has yet to develop consistent chemistry with a revamped group of receivers that has also had injuries.\n\nAs a result, Brady spent a good portion his 300th career NFL game Sunday under increasing pressure. He was sacked three times and hurried a total of six times by the Titans. He's only been sacked 16 times this season, but he's working harder in the pocket.\n\nBrady already has seven interceptions in 2018, one fewer than he had in all of 2017. They haven't all been the result of pressure from the defense. But he's had more overthrows working behind an increasingly injury-battered line that may be missing the leadership of free agency departure Nate Solder at left tackle.\n\nTrent Brown, who the Patriots acquired to fill Solder's spot, has started all 10 games and been solid. But he's now part of a growing list of offensive linemen nursing injuries.\n\nBrown missed the final drive of the first half against the Titans because of illness. LaAdrian Waddle replaced him for that series, with Brown returning early in the third quarter. But Brown left again with an injured back.\n\nEven more concerning for the Patriots (7-3) was the sight of Edelman leaving with an ankle injury. Gronkowski, who sat out Sunday, has now missed two of the last three games with ankle and back injuries. His backup, Dwayne Allen, could also miss some time after injuring his knee against Tennessee.\n\nBrady tried to lean on Josh Gordon, who has shined in recent weeks since his trade from Cleveland. But Gordon had just four catches on 12 targets against the Titans.\n\nIt added up to Brady being held without a touchdown pass for the second time in three weeks. His passer rating is down from 102.8 last season to 94.8 this season.\n\nDefensively there are concerns, too. After finding a groove in the second half of 2017, the Patriots haven't quite turned the same corner with linebacker coach Brian Flores calling plays following the departure of former defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. They are allowing 24 points and giving up 381 yards per game and continue to struggle with mobile quarterbacks.\n\nBrady said this upcoming bye week must feature a lot of self-assessment.\n\n\"I think the coaches will do a lot of self-scouting. I think we as players have to do the same thing,\" he said. \"Hopefully we learn from it. All of these games are a little bit different. ... The ones that we're going to play will be a little bit different. Winning football takes a lot of things. It takes a lot of good performances from a lot of people. Losing football is the exact opposite.\n\n\"Winning in the NFL is hard. You can't just show up expecting to win.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Christian, the Redskins' third-round pick who was forced into action by a bevy of injuries, hurt his knee Sunday at Tampa Bay.\n\nChristian's season-ending injury is the third along Washington's offensive line after knee injuries to starting guards Brandon Scherff and Shawn Lauvao.

(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Louisville interim football coach Lorenzo Ward said he is focused solely on salvaging the Cardinals' final two games rather than whether he will have the job permanently.\n\nIt's unclear who will be Louisville's next head coach, whether it's Ward or possibly Purdue's Jeff Brohm, a former Cardinals quarterback who has been mentioned as a possible candidate.\n\nIt's a challenge either way: Whether Ward gets the job is not within his control and ending the Cardinals seven-game slide that won't be easy against North Carolina State on Saturday.\n\n\"We're going through tough times,\" Ward said Monday in his first news conference as interim coach. \"They're used to winning. We're not, and the thing we want to do is try to make these next two weeks as fun as we can possibly make them.\n\n\"It's not going to be about me. ... It's about what we're going to do for these young men.\"\n\nWard, 51, was named Sunday to replace Bobby Petrino, who was dismissed after a 2-8 start featuring a handful of blowout losses. Louisville athletic director Vince Tyra said he tabbed the second-year safeties coach for his administrative and leadership skills.\n\nNo matter how the season ends on the field, Ward might not keep the job permanently.\n\nThere are already questions about who take the reins after the season finale against No. 20 Kentucky. Brohm has been frequently mentioned as the top candidate. The former Cardinals quarterback who became an assistant under Petrino acknowledged the reports Monday but dismissed them, saying he is concentrating on making the 5-5 Boilermakers bowl eligible.\n\n\"I've heard the noise just like everyone else,\" Brohm said during his weekly news conference. \"Unfortunately, it's important for me to not comment on any speculation right now. I have a job, and we've got work to do, and a lot of it. ...\n\nBrohm added that he was \"very appreciative of the job I have right now.\"\n\nWard is little short-handed in his preparation for the Boilermakers \u2014 three assistants were also let go.\n\nPetrino's son, quarterbacks coach Nick Petrino, defensive line coach L.D. Scott and linebackers coach Ryan Beard were also shown the door along with director of football operation Andy Wagner.\n\nWard \u2014 whose defensive background includes spending the 2009-15 seasons at South Carolina coaching backs and linemen such as 2014 NFL draft No. 1 overall pick Jadeveon Clowney \u2014 will handle defensive line duties along with quality control coach J.B. Lageman. Grady Brown will coach the secondary, while first-year defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder will maintain his current role.\n\nOffensive coordinator Lonnie Galloway will call plays and coach the quarterbacks. The next step is getting effort from a Louisville squad that has underachieved in many phases.\n\nThe Cardinals (0-7 Atlantic Coast Conference) enter Saturday's meeting with North Carolina State (6-3, 3-3) ranked at or near the bottom statistically in conference offense and defense. Last week's 54-23 loss at No. 12 Syracuse followed a 77-16 shellacking at No. 2 Clemson and led to Petrino's firing after a five-year second stint with the program. He will receive a $14 million of his contract.\n\nTyra on Sunday questioned the Cardinals' effort in some contests, which Ward slightly disagreed with. But the interim coach conceded there's room for improvement.\n\n\"We definitely can pick up our effort,\" he said. \"The guys have given great effort, but they haven't given maximum effort.\"\n\nThe Cardinals' morale hasn't been helped watching opponents regularly hang 50-plus points on them, either. Whether Ward changes things over the next two Saturdays remains to be seen, but players look forward to seeing what new leadership brings.\n\nUntil the next change, that is.\n\n\"I was shocked, but at the same time it was only a matter of time,\" junior defensive lineman G.G. Robinson said of Petrino's dismissal. \"It was like a big unknown cloud over everybody. We were having a bad season.\n\n\"It seemed like all the fans wanted it to happen and it finally happened, so now we just need to move forward and can't dwell on it.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Michael Marot in Indianapolis contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark LoMoglio) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are sticking with Ryan Fitzpatrick as their No. 1 quarterback.\n\nCoach Dirk Koetter said Monday that the 14th-year pro, who failed to produce a touchdown in the previous day's 16-3 loss to Washington, will start next Sunday on the road against the New York Giants.\n\nThe Bucs (3-6) have dropped six of seven games following a 2-0 start, with Fitzpatrick starting four of the losses after leading the team to surprising victories over New Orleans and Philadelphia while Jameis Winston was serving a suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy.\n\n\"We're going to go with Fitz this week,\" Koetter said, adding he still feels Fitzpatrick \"gives us the best opportunity\" to win and pull out of a tailspin that's jeopardized the prospects of ending a long playoff drought.\n\nAlso, struggling kicker Chandler Catanzaro was waived.\n\nCatanzaro was one for three on field goals against the Redskins, missing from 30 and 47 yards. In addition to being 11 of 15 through nine games, the fifth-year pro who signed as a free agent after spending last season with the New York Jets has missed four extra points.\n\nWinston, banned the first three games of the season for touching a female Uber driver inappropriately in 2016, regained his starting job for three games before being benched three weeks ago.\n\nKoetter left open the possibility of switching back to Winston after the Bucs gained 501 yards, but only scored three points against the Redskins. Fitzpatrick threw for 406 yards, but was intercepted twice and lost a fumble.\n\nWashington finished with four takeaways, while Tampa Bay failed to force a turnover for the sixth consecutive game.\n\n\"Turnovers are killing us right now. We're minus-19 (in turnover differential), last in the league,\" Koetter said. \"Thirteen turnovers and no takeaways in the last four games. That's by far the No. 1 thing that's hurting our team.\"\n\nWinston hasn't played since throwing four interceptions during the first three quarters of a road loss at Cincinnati on Oct. 28. The fourth-year player has thrown 10 picks and lost one fumble in four games since returning from his suspension.\n\nKoetter remains optimistic that the Bucs, who haven't made the playoffs since 2007, can turn themselves around.\n\nWinston, the first overall pick from the 2015 draft, is due to earn $20.9 million next year in the final season of the contract he signed as a rookie.\n\nKoetter said he understands the thinking that the Bucs need to find out exactly what they have in the fourth-year pro.\n\nNevertheless, he's sticking with Fitzpatrick for now.\n\n\"We're barely past the halfway point in the season. There's a lot of football to be played. I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that we can turn this thing and get on a little bit of a win streak,\" Koetter said.\n\n\"We've got to play better football more consistently across the board,\" the coach added. \"Our defense took a nice step in that direction (Sunday). I still think when we put it together on both sides of the ball we'll be all right.\"\n\nFitzpatrick, 2-4 as the starter this season, has 2,199 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He's turned the ball over five times the past two weeks during losses to Carolina and Washington.\n\nAfter Sunday's game, the 35-year-old shrugged off a question about whether he felt he had done enough to retain the starting job.\n\n\"I love playing football. That's not something I concern myself with or care about,\" said Fitzpatrick, who's played for seven teams over 14 seasons. \"If I get a chance to go out there, I try to do my best and play as hard as I can and enjoy myself.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 There might be something to Oklahoma's \"Championship November\" mantra.\n\nThe Sooners have won 15 consecutive November games dating to the 2014 season. They already have won two games this November heading into Saturday's game against Kansas.\n\n\"Coaches preach it,\" receiver Marquise Brown said. \"It's big around here, football in November. That's where football championships are won. You have to get through November to get to where you want to be. We take big pride in playing games in November.\"\n\nThe late-season success, fueled by coach Lincoln Riley's high-powered offenses, has helped Oklahoma claim three consecutive Big 12 titles and make two trips to the College Football Playoff. The sixth-ranked Sooners believe they can make another run at both this season.\n\n\"We know what's at stake,\" Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray said. \"We can't lose a game. We don't want to lose a game. The standard around Oklahoma is to go as far as possible. For us, that's obviously win a Big 12 Championship and see where that puts us, and we know that. I think that's just what keeps us humble and keep working hard.\"\n\nGRINDING IT OUT\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield won the Heisman last season and Murray is a strong contender this season. They have combined to start all but two of the games. Yet, the Sooners are averaging 289.4 yards rushing during the streak while averaging 6.2 yards per carry. Oklahoma has averaged 47 rush attempts to 27 pass attempts, showing a willingness to pound the ball and take pressure off its quarterbacks.\n\nEFFICIENT PASSING\n\nOklahoma has completed nearly 68 percent of its passes during the streak. When you combine a strong, steady running game with efficient, Heisman-caliber quarterbacks, you get something like this: 576.9 yards and 46.9 points per game. Mayfield has set the NCAA single-season passer efficiency record each of the past two seasons, and Murray is having an even more efficient season this year.\n\nSPECTACULAR PERFORMANCES\n\nOklahoma has set its single-game records for rushing, passing and receiving yardage during this run. Samaje Perine's 427-yard performance against Kansas in 2014 remains the FBS rushing record for a game. Last season against Oklahoma State, Mayfield passed for a school-record 598 yards and Brown had a school-best 265 yards receiving.\n\nWINNING THE CLOSE ONES\n\nWhen things have gotten shaky, the Sooners have made critical defensive plays. In 2015, when Oklahoma lost most of its lead against TCU, Steven Parker batted away a pass on a 2-point conversion with 51 seconds remaining to help the Sooners hold on for a 30-29 victory. Two weeks ago, Robert Barnes ran back an interception on a 2-point conversion for two critical points in the fourth quarter of a 51-46 win over Texas Tech. Last week, Oklahoma State pulled to within 48-47 with 1:03 remaining, but Tre Brown got his hand on Taylor Cornelius' 2-point conversion pass, and the Sooners held on.\n\nMINIMIZING MISTAKES\n\nOklahoma has forced 27 turnovers while committing just 15 during the streak. The Sooners have lost the turnover battle just three times in those games. Oklahoma has allowed 27.6 points in those contests, which isn't horrible by Big 12 standards, and certainly more than enough help for Riley's offenses.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

There are also two big head-to-head matchups the last two weekends of the regular season before then.\n\nThree-time defending Big 12 champion Oklahoma (9-1, 6-1 Big 12) or the Mountaineers (8-1, 6-1) advance by winning their last two games. Since they play each other in the regular-season finale, it is impossible for both to finish 8-1 in conference play, but they could also still face each other two weeks in a row \u2014 the day after Thanksgiving in Morgantown and then for the Big 12 title in the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys.\n\n\"We've got a lot of big goals and our goals are kind of predicated on us playing our best ball here at the end of year,\" Sooners coach Lincoln Riley said Monday.\n\nEvery Big 12 team plays each other in the round-robin conference schedule that sets up one rematch for a guaranteed spot in the New Year's Six bowl game. And if Oklahoma or West Virginia win out, they could possibly make it into the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"That means there's going to be really important games coming down the stretch run,\" Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \"That's what makes this time of year really special, especially in this conference.\"\n\nIowa State (6-3, 5-2) plays Saturday at Texas (7-3, 5-2) in what will be their only meeting this season. There is no possible scenario that could create a championship game rematch between the teams currently tied for third place.\n\nThe Cyclones have won five Big 12 games in a row for the first time in school history. That has come since opening conference play with losses to Oklahoma and TCU, the teams that played in last year's Big 12 title game after both lost to Iowa State in the 2017 regular season.\n\nSince a 37-27 win at Iowa State in mid-September, Oklahoma has scored at least 45 points in each of its last six conference games. But the Sooners lost 48-45 to Texas, a setback that would keep them out of the Big 12 title game if it came down to a head-to-head tiebreaker between the Red River rivals.\n\nWest Virginia's only loss was a month ago at Iowa State, but the Mountaineers won 42-41 at Texas when quarterback Will Grier ran for a 2-point conversion in the final minute.\n\nThat means opposite tiebreaker scenarios against the current co-leaders for the Longhorns and Cyclones: Texas over Oklahoma; and Iowa State over West Virginia.\n\nKansas (3-7, 1-6), the only Big 12 team so far that can't get bowl eligible, is also the only team that will finish the regular season against two of the title-contending teams. The Jayhawks are at Oklahoma on Saturday, and host Texas in their finale Nov. 23.\n\n\"We just lost our opportunity to become bowl eligible, so obviously our goals will shift from here,\" outgoing Kansas coach David Beaty said. \"We love those opportunities, and when it comes down to the situation, it would be spoiler for others. But for us, it's about our seniors and it's about our team being able to provide as many victories for our university, these seniors and really for the future of Kansas football.\"\n\nOklahoma has won 13 consecutive games against the Jayhawks by an average margin of 31 points, and its last home loss in the series was 1996, the first Big 12 season. Kansas is 1-14 against Texas in the Big 12, though the Longhorns lost in their last visit to Lawrence two years ago.\n\nThe closing schedules for the four contending teams, and results against other contenders:\n\n\u2014 Oklahoma (6-1 conference record)\n\nHome vs. Kansas, Saturday; at West Virginia, Nov. 23.\n\nBeat Iowa State 37-27 on Sept. 15; Lost to Texas 48-45 on Oct. 6.\n\n\u2014 West Virginia (6-1)\n\nAt Oklahoma State, Saturday; home vs. Oklahoma, Nov. 23.\n\nLost to Iowa State 30-14 on Oct. 13; Beat Texas 42-41 on Nov. 3.\n\n\u2014 Texas (5-2)\n\nHome vs. Iowa State, Saturday; at Kansas, Nov. 23.\n\nBeat Oklahoma 48-45 on Oct. 6; Lost to West Virginia 42-41 on Nov. 3.\n\n\u2014 Iowa State (5-2)\n\nAt Texas, Saturday; Home vs. Kansas State, Nov. 24.\n\nLost to Oklahoma 37-27 on Sept. 15; Beat West Virginia 30-14 on Oct. 13.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Either way, democracy loses. Again.\u201d\n\nPatrick Murphy, USA TODAY: \u201cMy vote on Nov. 6 may not end up being counted.

It is imperative that we treat the right to vote as the most sacred right of all.\u201d\n\nMary Anne Marsh, FoxNews.com: \u201cRepublicans prevailed by restricting the number of votes counted in 2000. That won\u2019t work in 2018. Voters now see the efforts Republicans have gone to in the last 18 years to restrict voting, actively engaging in voter suppression, dropping voters from voter registration files, gerrymandering, and other actions that make it harder to vote and interfere when they are counted. ... Counting every vote, properly and fairly, is the most basic tenet of democracy.

Simplification on offense and big plays on defense.\n\nThe offense got a big boost from dynamic running back Aaron Jones and their best red-zone weapon, Davante Adams.\n\nJones powered in from two yards out on a read option just two plays after a 67-yard run. Later, he cut back behind terrific interior blocks and pinballed into the end zone for a second score.\n\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers credited the run game for improving in the red zone.\n\n\u201cReally, running the ball, I think,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been throwing it so many times in the red zone. We had some effective runs, which we hadn\u2019t had in a while.\u201d\n\nHe also got help from Adams.\n\nOn the Packers\u2019 first touchdown, Rodgers froze the safety with a quick look to his right and came back to the left, where Adams beat his man with a slant and opened up the passing lane. It was an easy pitch and catch for the two.\n\nLater, Adams took advantage of a blown zone coverage and made an uncontested catch before skipping into the end zone.\n\nThe two would have had a third touchdown in the fourth quarter, but Rodgers missed his mark a little high and Adams wasn\u2019t able to come down with the catch in the end zone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mad at myself for missing him on that third touchdown, he ran a really nice route,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nThe defense held up their end of the bargain.\n\nThree times on Miami\u2019s first four possessions, the Packers made a stop inside the 20-yard line.\n\nOn the first, Dolphins quarterback Brock Osweiler mishandled the snap and couldn\u2019t corral the resulting fumble. Two possessions later, Kyler Fackrell\u2019s third-down sack halted a drive that penetrated to Green Bay\u2019s 11-yard line. A deeper penetration \u2013 this time to the 8-yard line a drive later \u2013 resulted in nothing more than another field goal after rookie safety Raven Greene nearly intercepted Osweiler on an underneath route.\n\nThe Dolphins\u2019 early production on offense resulted in only six points. Big win for Mike Pettine\u2019s group.\n\nMiami never entered the red zone again.\n\nThe Packers held strong after a blocked punt in their own territory and forced another field goal after making a tackle short of the sticks on third down. Later, the Dolphins advanced to the Packers\u2019 26-yard line but were turned back and eventually had to punt after Greene sacked Osweiler for a 12-yard loss on third down.\n\n\u201cI thought the defense did a heck of a job keeping them out of the end zone there a couple times, holding them to field goals,\u201d coach Mike McCarthy said.\n\nThe Packers desperately needed a win Sunday against the Dolphins. Seven trips in the red zone \u2013 four on offense, three on defense \u2013 provided the foundation for a victory. More successes inside the 20-yard line will be required for the Packers to keep winning over the final seven games.", "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The Panthers have waived backup running back C.J.

The most-awarded album in country music history and her first real pop crossover effort, it debuted at No. 1 and became the best-selling album of 2009, making Swift, who was 18 when \u201cFearless\u201d was released, the youngest artist in history to have that distinction. At 20, she also became the youngest-ever artist to win a Grammy for album of the year, when \u201cFearless\u201d won the night\u2019s top prize, along with three other trophies, at the 2010 Grammy Awards. Of its five singles, two became crossover hits, \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong With Me,\u201d which sold millions of copies each and firmly established her in the pop world. Before \u201cFearless,\u201d she had never headlined a tour -- just months after its release, she was selling out arenas.\n\nMore: Taylor Swift's political statement is a redeeming moment for the star\n\nRelated: Stop telling female artists to 'shut up and sing,' from Beyonc\u00e9 to Taylor Swift\n\n\u201cFearless\u201d wasn\u2019t just an album for Swift, it was an era, one that much of America likely still associates with the star to some extent. \u201cFearless\u201d established Taylor Swift persona of the wide-eyed, guitar-toting girl with her ball gowns and flowing blonde hair, who wrote her own songs about fairytales and Shakespearean heroines and the occasional famous ex. In retrospect, it\u2019s more than a little reductive.\n\nAnd while Swift certainly participated in the princess-ing of her character during these years, revisiting the reviews of \u201cFearless\u201d reveal just how many of the critical takes used her status as a teenager almost as a genre signifier, that she was making teen music for teen listeners, with more than one article containing some version of the line about her being broadly appealing, \u201cthough she\u2019s a teenage girl.\u201d\n\nTen years and over 10 million copies later, it\u2019s not even worth saying that \u201cFearless\u201d is not just an album for teenage girls, nor is it limited to being about the experiences of one. Swift has audibly matured in many ways in the decade since with her earnestly-sung vocals with their hint of a twang growing more refined over time as she\u2019s become a more experienced pop vocalist, as the settings of her songs have shifted from the school cafeterias and parents\u2019 houses of \u201cFearless\u201d to the dive bars and apartment-building bedrooms of her most recent release, 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d\n\nYet, don\u2019t be fooled by its more juvenile-seeming settings -- \u201cFearless\u201d is not, by any means, a juvenile work. Upon relistening to \u201cFearless,\u201d it\u2019s clear that Swift\u2019s skills for writing earworm melodies and spinning vivid imagery out of plainspoken storytelling are almost as strong on that album as they are today, a remarkable reminder of her talents as an artist.\n\nReview: Taylor Swift's 'Reputation': A fully-formed look at a singer in love, and in control\n\nAnd revisiting \u201cFearless\u201d reveals the funny truth that, for all the lives Swift has lived in her ten years of pop stardom since its release, her most recent music release shares its predominant emotions with the music she was making when she was 18. Even though she\u2019s long since traded guitars and fiddles for Max Martin beats, \u201cReputation\u201d sees Swift in the kind of love that she hasn\u2019t articulated in song since her fairytale-telling \u201cFearless\u201d days. Her world is smaller now, too, in a way it hasn\u2019t been since \u201cFearless\u201d -- except while \u201cFearless\u201d was written by someone with minimal life experiences, \u201cReputation\u201d comes from the perspective of a star whose life expanded too rapidly, who now sees the value in a more contained, private existence.\n\nThat's evidence of the special role \"Fearless\" will always play in Swift's story, the album that made her a star, that captured her at the point at which she most believed in magic. And the joy of \"Fearless\" is how its spirit will live on -- in her greatest-hits repertoire and her live shows, certainly, but also in her recordings to come, whenever she needs to channel the joys and pains of youth.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/12/its-10-year-anniversary-taylor-swifts-fearless-still-classic/1936056002/", "", "DURHAM, N.H.

(AP Photo/Andy Clayton-King) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nIndiana coach Tom Allen understands the challenges his team faces this weekend.\n\nNo. 4 Michigan is the Big Ten's highest-ranked team and the one most likely to carry the conference banner into the College Football Playoff if anyone does. The Wolverines have won nine straight since losing to No. 3 Notre Dame and need another win to set up a showdown with No. 9 Ohio State for a ticket to the Big Ten championship game.\n\nAllen, of course, also knows the refrain echoing throughout his home state: Indiana hasn't won at Michigan since 1967.\n\nNone of it matters to the Hoosiers, who ended a four-game losing streak Saturday and now need one more win to become bowl-eligible.\n\n\"We changed our schedule for the very purpose of being at our best in weeks nine, 10, 11 and 12,\" Allen said Monday. \"We really felt like last year for multiple reasons, it wasn't just one thing, but for multiple reasons we kind of ran out of juice and did not have the same energy at the end.\"\n\nSaturday's victory over Maryland should give the Hoosiers (5-5, 2-5 Big Ten) more than just an energy boost.\n\nThey desperately needed a home win to build some momentum for the home stretch and to give themselves a realistic chance of becoming bowl-eligible for the third time in four years.\n\nAllen made points perfectly clear to his players last week when he decided to discuss the postseason situation, something he did not do in 2017. Indiana responded to Allen's message by using Steve Scott's long run to set up a 42-yard field goal with 2:32 left and a force a late turnover to close out a crucial 34-32 victory over Maryland on Saturday.\n\nNow comes the harder part, winning No. 6 either at Michigan this weekend or at home against bitter rival Purdue in their home finale.\n\n\"Anxious for our guys to respond in the right way to be able to build off of this and take momentum into the biggest game of our season,\" Allen said. \"Our guys understand that.\"\n\nFor programs like Indiana's, this time of the season can be quite challenging as speculation runs rampant about bowl destinations and coaching changes.\n\nJust ask Purdue (5-5, 4-3), which is in a similar predicament in part for a very different reason.\n\nThe Boilermakers also need one win to become bowl-eligible and host Wisconsin (6-4, 4-3) on Saturday before visiting Bloomington the following week for a potential winner-takes-all regular-season finale.\n\nThe chatter around Purdue became more complicated after Louisville fired coach Bobby Petrino on Sunday and Boilermakers coach Jeff Brohm immediately jumped to the top of his alma mater's wish list. Brohm was peppered with questions about the opening Monday and tried to downplay the rumors emanating from his hometown.\n\n\"I have a job, and we've got work to do, and a lot of it. We're going to put forth the effort to do that,\" Brohm said. \"We've got a tough opponent this week, and then we've got to go to IU, and we're going to have to play well, and we're going to have to play much better than we did last week. So I'm going to stay focused on that, and I'm very appreciative of the job I have right now.\"\n\nBrohm has become a frequently mentioned candidate on the coaching carrousel, especially after beating expectations each of his first two seasons at Purdue. Last year, he led the Boilermakers to a bowl game victory and last month Purdue blew out Ohio State in one of this season's most shocking upsets.\n\nBut Allen, like Brohm, has only one goal this week: Beating a good opponent this weekend so they don't have to fret over the stakes next weekend.\n\n\"We know what they've accomplished this year,\" Allen said, describing Michigan. \"They're really playing at a high level, and coach (Jim) Harbaugh's got them doing a lot of great things. So great opportunity, great challenge this weekend.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Chargers have had to make plenty of adjustments this season on defense due to injuries and suspensions. They will have to make another with one of their leading tacklers lost for the remainder of the year.\n\nCoach Anthony Lynn said Monday that linebacker Denzel Perryman injured the lateral collateral ligament in his left knee during the first quarter of Sunday's 20-6 win against Oakland and will undergo surgery. The 5-foot-11, 240-pound inside linebacker had started every game this season and was second in tackles with 51 going into the Raiders game.\n\n\"It is definitely a blow to our defense. When Denzel is on the roster he is a difference-maker,\" Lynn said.\n\nPerryman is one of the team's top defenders against the run with 15 stuffs (tackles on running plays for no gain or a loss). Los Angeles is ranked 17th in the league against the run. It has allowed only one running back to rush for over 100 yards (the Rams' Todd Gurley in Week 3) but the Chargers have been inconsistent.\n\nThe Chargers are allowing an average of 133.8 yards per game on the ground over the past four games, which is 22 yards more than their season average.\n\nThe one area where they have made improvement is in the pass rush. They have 15 sacks in the past four games and have four interceptions.\n\n\"We have done a better job at stopping the explosive plays. As we stop passes going over our heads our defense has been playing a lot better,\" cornerback Desmond King said.\n\nPerryman has been unable to remain healthy during his four years in the league. He missed four games in 2016 due to hamstring and knee injuries and did not play in the first eight games last season after suffering an ankle injury in the preseason. He was drafted in the second round in 2015 and is in the final year of his contract.\n\nPerryman is the second Chargers linebacker who has been placed on IR. Kyzir White, who started the first three games at one of the outside spots, was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 3 due to a knee injury. The team has not ruled out the possibility that he may return by the end of the year since it has not used its designated-to-return spot.\n\nHayes Pullard and Kyle Emanuel, who both saw 16 snaps against Oakland, are in the mix to move into Perryman's starting spot. Pullard started 10 games last season after being claimed off waivers and posted a career-high 79 tackles.\n\nDefensive end Joey Bosa has missed the season due to a foot injury, but he has made progress in his rehab. Lynn said Monday that there isn't a timetable for Bosa's return, but he did not completely rule him out for this week's game against Denver.\n\nThe Chargers have won six straight despite their injury woes, which is their longest winning streak since they took 11 straight in 2009.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The Jacksonville Jaguars are busting defensive assignments at an alarming rate.\n\nThey are allowing receivers to get wide open across the field. They are letting tight ends go completely uncovered. They are missing calls, failing to communicate coverages and giving up explosive plays left and right.\n\nA defense that believed it could be generational a few months ago looks mostly generic the last few weeks.\n\nThe Jaguars (3-6) gave up 29 points and 306 yards in the first half to Indianapolis and lost 29-26 on Sunday . The Colts managed just 60 yards after the break, but dropped two passes that would have resulted in big gains.\n\nRegardless, Jacksonville lost its fifth consecutive game and pretty much ruined its already slim chances of returning to the postseason. Inconsistent quarterback Blake Bortles and a growing number of injuries are partly to blame. But equally troubling is how the once-vaunted defense has fallen well short of expectations.\n\n\"I can't say what's going on in the next man's head,\" safety Tashaun Gipson said Monday. \"We go over our in-game adjustments. The coaches tell us what to expect, what we learn from each play and things like that. I don't know what those guys who are a part of those busted coverages are seeing. To be honest, it has to be just total brain farts.\n\n\"You're looking at guys running wild in coverages that we've been playing here for (three years). Even back in 2016, we weren't a great football team, but it wasn't this many consecutive busts week in and week out.\"\n\nCornerback Jalen Ramsey played his worst game in three years, getting caught in the wrong coverage twice against the Colts.\n\nThe 2017 All-Pro played man-to-man defense against T.Y. Hilton when he should have been in zone, leaving tight end Eric Ebron to run unmarked for a 53-yard touchdown reception on the opening drive. Ramsey played zone later in the first quarter when he should been in man, allowing Hilton to get loose for a 35-yard gain.\n\nRamsey also got burned for a touchdown by tight end Mo Alie-Cox.\n\nRamsey responded to criticism Monday via Twitter by saying, \"When I'm gone from here, y'all gone miss me. I ain't even trippin lol.\"\n\nCoach Doug Marrone said he understands fans being upset with the team's performance and Ramsey's remarks.\n\n\"There are people that support this team, that expected great things from this team, and we're not performing at that level,\" Marrone said. \"At the end of the day, if you're not strong enough to understand that, that's not going to help the team get on the right track. Anyone.\"\n\nSafety Barry Church also blew a man-coverage scheme in the first half when he failed to line up properly, and Luck found Ebron all alone for a 12-yard score.\n\n\"The busts came up in the Dallas game, and they've just been a recurring theme since then,\" Gipson said. \"What to do about it? I don't know. It's hard to blame coaching for busts, but at the same time, everybody's got to be accountable in this thing right here for sure.\"\n\nJacksonville hosts Pittsburgh (6-2-1) on Sunday, a rematch from the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Jaguars held on for a 45-42 victory despite surrendering touchdowns on Pittsburgh's final three possessions. Given how the Jags have played lately, especially in the first half against the Colts, no one would be surprised to see the Steelers pick up where they left off in January.\n\n\"As cliche as it may sounds, there's only one way to go for this team right now,\" Gipson said. \"I think our backs are truly, truly against the wall. ... I've been on terrible teams and I've been on teams that when you're 3-6, you're like, 'Hey, man, that's a lot better than I thought we would be nine games in.'\n\n\"The feeling right now, it's tough on a lot of guys because this is not a 3-6 team.\"\n\nNOTES: Marrone said center Brandon Linder will have surgery on his right knee and miss the rest of the season. Linder, a third-round draft pick from Miami in 2014, will have missed 26 games in five years. He signed a five-year contract worth $51.7 million, with $24 million guaranteed, in July 2017. Linder also is the team's third offensive lineman \u2014 second starter \u2014 to land on injured reserve.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) \u2014 One season after Michigan's wide receivers could not get in the end zone, coach Jim Harbaugh had just one complaint about the Wolverines' pass catchers on Saturday.\n\nThe guy with the black-rimmed glasses and khakis couldn't haul them in.\n\n\"I dropped two in the pregame,\" Harbaugh said Monday. \"Which I pride myself in, catching them all. There was two drops by me and none by the receivers, which was outstanding. They continue to be really good about that.\"\n\nMichigan's receivers battled windy conditions in a 42-7 win at Rutgers, the ninth straight for the fourth-ranked Wolverines (9-1, 7-0, No. 4 CFP). One reason for the team's sustained run of success has been the production by quarterback Shea Patterson's targets on the outside.\n\nLeading the way again Saturday was sophomore Donovan Peoples-Jones, who is fulfilling the five-star promise he brought to campus last season.\n\nPeoples-Jones arrived last season from Cass Tech, a Detroit powerhouse, catching 22 passes as a freshman for 277 yards and no receiving touchdowns. This season, he's caught seven touchdowns among his 30 grabs for 447 yards.\n\n\"Just playing with my teammates has been so much fun this year,\" Peoples-Jones said. \"As a player, you want to be efficient. That's the name of the game. Doing what you got to do.\"\n\nHis touchdown on Sept. 8 against Western Michigan broke a run of 364 days without a TD catch from a Michigan wide receiver. A week later, against SMU, he caught three scores, helping ease the burden for the group and new wide receivers coach Jim McElwain, the former Florida head coach.\n\n\"He can jump, run, catch, all those, just the stuff you can't teach,\" senior wide receiver Grant Perry said, adding that Peoples-Jones has grown this year in \"maturity and being a leader as well, helping other guys.\"\n\nMaking matters easier is stability at quarterback. Patterson, a transfer from Ole Miss, has thrown 17 touchdowns and three interceptions, hitting seven different receivers for scores.\n\nThe Wolverines host Indiana (5-5, 2-5) on Saturday for senior day before the Nov. 24 test at No. 9 Ohio State, winners of 13 of the last 14 against its rivals to the north.\n\nOne player who has not caught any touchdowns \u2014 or passes at all \u2014 this season is sophomore Tarik Black, who is still working his way back from a broken right foot.\n\nLast season, Black lined up opposite Peoples-Jones, and the true freshman looked to be gaining steam early in the year with Black as the team's leading receiver. Then, Black suffered a broken left foot in the third game and didn't return.\n\nThis year, the injury to the other foot occurred in the week leading up to the opener at Notre Dame, Michigan's only loss. Black saw his first action this season on Oct. 20 against Michigan State and has played sporadically since then. Harbaugh said he continues to progress.\n\n\"Fully engaged with the trainers and him on the things he can do,\" Harbaugh said. \"Some certain types of routes, maybe we're saying that's not as good (if it) just puts more pressure on that outside part of his foot, but he's become more confident with it.\"\n\nHis return could give Patterson another late-season weapon as the team tries to earn a spot in the College Football Playoff. The receiver group also includes sophomore Nico Collins, who has 26 catches and four touchdowns. Tight end Zach Gentry has 28 catches for 392 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nPeoples-Jones also has been showing some bravado, mimicking former Penn State running back Saquon Barkley's touchdown celebration after scoring against the Nittany Lions.\n\n\"Just having fun. Being out there with my boys, as a kid that I am,\" Peoples-Jones said. \"Enjoying playing football and enjoying playing for Michigan, and loving everything about this program.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Pittsburgh won 52-22.(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Darrin Hall paused for a second and pondered the question. Fresh off a 186-yard performance in front of his infant daughter in a victory that catapulted Pittsburgh to the brink of its first appearance in the ACC championship game, the senior running back tried to put a finger on the last time so much came so easily.\n\n\"It had to be Pop Warner when I was about 6 years old,\" Hall said. \"But I'll try to keep it going.\"\n\nSo will the rest of the resurgent Panthers (6-4, 5-1 ACC), who have taken on a decidedly old-school persona while resurrecting their season. Pitt is averaging 410 yards rushing during its three-game winning streak, including a staggering 492 in a 52-22 dismantling of Virginia Tech on Saturday that moved the Panthers within one victory of capturing the typically chaotic ACC Coastal Division.\n\nIn an era when offenses have become increasingly diverse, the Panthers are going in another direction. Pitt is playing with a determined physicality on offense that eschews intricacy for something more basic. The Panthers snapped the ball 47 times against the Hokies. On 36 of those snaps, quarterback Kenny Pickett either handed the ball off \u2014 primarily to Hall or Qadree Ollison \u2014 or took off himself.\n\nThe way Pickett figures it, why not?\n\n\"Those are two of the best backs in the country, no doubt, and you add that with the line that we have, they're a dangerous group,\" Pickett said. \"You feel real good having them two next to you or behind you in the backfield.\"\n\nOllison became the sixth player in program history to record multiple 1,000-yard rushing seasons after piling up 235 yards and three scores against Virginia Tech, 97 of them coming on a sprint down the right sideline for a fourth-quarter touchdown that marked the longest play from scrimmage ever for a school that's been playing football for 114 years.\n\nAnd yet all Ollison did afterward was marvel at the play of the offensive line \u2014 he had the starting five join him in the postgame news conference on Saturday \u2014 and Hall, his longtime backfield mate. The two have forged a unique friendship during their overlapping careers. Ollison has become the workhorse, meaning Hall's touches are somewhat limited.\n\nIt's what Hall is doing with those touches, however, that has drawn Ollison's admiration. Hall carried the ball just seven times against Virginia Tech and nearly topped 200 yards, forcing Ollison to do the math.\n\n\"That's 27 yards a carry,\" Ollison said. \"I was telling him, 'Save some long runs for me.'\"\n\nAt the moment, there are plenty to go around for the Panthers. Pitt averaged 13.6 yards per carry on Saturday. The Panthers are 10th in the country in yards rushing per game and do it while working out of a conventional set. No triple option. Little read option. Just line up, snap the ball and go.\n\n\"Our offense will be about as foreign to most teams in this conference ... because they don't get to see it every week,\" coach Pat Narduzzi said.\n\nMaybe, but 10 games in, very few secrets remain. Pitt has struggled throwing the ball all season, forcing the Panthers to rely heavily on the run to move the ball. Virginia Tech \u2014 much like every other team Pitt has played over the last five weeks while the Panthers righted their season \u2014 knew what was coming. And still, the Hokies couldn't stop it.\n\n\"It goes down to the toughness part of the game, so if you're going to be a tough football team, you'd better stop the run and run the football,\" Narduzzi said. \"And that's why we live in Pittsburgh, that's why we're here. That's what the Steelers are; that's what we are.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers a speech during a ceremony at the American Cemetery of Suresnes, outside Paris, on Nov. 11, 2018, as part of Veterans Day and commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the 11 November 1918 armistice, ending World War I. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump has turned his attention to another media issue: the potential for anti-competitive business practices by Comcast-NBCUniversal.\n\nThe president on Twitter Monday echoed the concerns of the American Cable Association, a trade group of more than 700 smaller video and internet providers, which asked the Justice Department in a letter last week to investigate whether \"Comcast-NBC is acting anticompetitively.\"\n\nJust as the DOJ has appealed AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner for potential anticompetitive harms, so should the DOJ monitor investigate Comcast-NBCUniversal, the ACA argues.\n\n\"American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws.\"\n\nMore: Post Paris, President Trump again complains about NATO\n\nMore: President Trump calls for end to Florida recount; tweets, without evidence, ballots 'massively infected'\n\nMore: Donald Trump says he may revoke press credentials for other reporters, not just CNN's Jim Acosta\n\nHe then added a quote attributed to Fox Business Network senior correspondent Charles Gasparino, who had written a story on the issue: \"These guys are acting much worse, and have much more potential for damage to consumers, than anything AT&T-Time Warner would do.\"\n\nAmerican Cable Association has big problems with Comcast. They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws. \u201cThese guys are acting much worse, and have much more potential for damage to consumers, than anything AT&T-Time Warner would do.\u201d Charlie Gasparino \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nTrump has repeatedly targeted the media, calling it the \"true enemy of the people.\" Last week, the White House revoked CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after Trump criticized him and other reporters in including NBC's Peter Alexander and American Urban Radio Networks correspondent April Ryan.\n\nComcast, when it acquired a 51 percent stake in NBCUniversal in 2011, agreed to agreed to the DOJ's seven-year set of conditions that precluded anti-competitive actions and protected open internet provisions. That settlement expired in September. In 2013, Comcast paid $16.7 billion to acquire the remainder of General Electric\u2019s stake in the joint venture.\n\nComcast declined comment on Trump's tweet, but did release a statement addressing the ACA letter: \"At Comcast NBCUniversal, we are competing in this dynamic environment the way we always have \u2013 by continuing to innovate and conducting our business in compliance with antitrust laws and other legal requirements. ... We believe that ACA\u2019s letter is without merit and constitutes an inappropriate attempt to gain leverage in the commercial marketplace.\"\n\nBack in August, the DOJ's antitrust division wrote a letter to Comcast telling the media company it would continue monitoring its TV programming and distribution practices, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe ACA, in its letter dated Nov. 6, said it was \"heartened\" by the DOJ's action. \"Comcast-NBCU\u2019s ability to raise programming prices in local markets is unmatched by any similar problem created by the AT&T-TW combination,\" the ACA wrote. \"Unlike Time Warner, Comcast-NBCU owns significant must-have local programming, including 11 NBC local television stations and seven NBC Regional Sports Networks, and unlike AT&T, Comcast is the dominant multichannel video programming distributor in many of these local markets with market shares above 60 percent.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/media/2018/11/12/trump-suggests-comcast-nbcuniversal-may-violate-antitrust-laws/1980152002/", "Professional athletes often resort to empty cliches and generic answers after a disappointing loss.

(AP) \u2014 Carrying a three-game losing streak and a losing record, the Baltimore Ravens now face the burden of uncertainty at the quarterback position.\n\nJoe Flacco is nursing a hip injury that could keep him out of Sunday's game against Cincinnati, an AFC North matchup that carries huge ramifications for the sagging Ravens.\n\nWith Baltimore coming off a bye, Flacco received an additional week of rest and treatment after sustaining the injury on Nov. 4 in the opening minutes of a 23-16 loss to Pittsburgh.\n\nFlacco went the distance, completed 23 of 37 passes for 206 yards. His status this week, however, is unclear.\n\n\"He's getting treatment, just like all the guys are getting treatment, and we'll see,\" coach John Harbaugh said Monday. \"I'd say that we'll know more as the week goes on and I'm hopeful all our guys play, including Joe.\"\n\nIf Flacco can't play, rookie Lamar Jackson will likely get his first NFL start, although veteran Robert Griffin III is also an option. Griffin gets the nod in NFL experience, but he's been inactive in every game this season while Jackson has been used periodically because of his ability to run.\n\n\"It's up in the air. We're not worried about it,\" Harbaugh insisted. \"We're blessed with a good quarterback room. It's a good thing, that's a positive thing. We've got three guys who can play. It's just like any other position in my mind. You go with the next guy and you roll.\"\n\nThe Ravens (4-5) reached their bye week with losses to New Orleans, Carolina and Pittsburgh. The skid ruined a decent start and left the team in recovery mode as it seeks to snap a run of three straight seasons without reaching the playoffs.\n\nThis is the 11th season that Harbaugh and Flacco have been together in Baltimore, and the coach would love to see his quarterback rally the Ravens into the postseason.\n\n\"Any direction we decide to go or we're forced to go, it will be based on the health of Joe. If Joe can play, he'll play,\" Harbaugh said. \"He's rehabbing to play. Joe does not have to practice to play. He's practiced the whole season, he's practiced for 11 years. But he might practice. We just have to see how it goes.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old Flacco has played through many an injury throughout his career. He did so against the Steelers. His teammates feel that if he can walk, he will play.\n\n\"Joe is one of the toughest guys I've played with, maybe the toughest guy,\" guard Marshal Yanda said. \"You never see him limping around, you never see him on the field showing any sign of weakness. He's just been a rock for us. I have nothing but respect for the guy.\"\n\nTackles Ronnie Stanley (ankle) and James Hurst (back) did not play against the Steelers, but both are expected to return Sunday when the Ravens begin a stretch \u2014 with or without Flacco \u2014 that will define their season.\n\n\"We're in the hunt,\" Harbaugh said. \"We'll write the story of the Ravens' 2018 season by how we play in the next seven weeks. That's what our guys are juiced up for. Get the Cincinnati Bengals in as fast as we can, and let's go play the game.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

People in the seats, they\u2019re cheering for their team. Regardless good, bad or indifferent, they still showing up each and every week going hard.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Yes, the narrative of Joe Mauer's career was missing a championship chapter. That plotline stalled for a few years while the star was set back by injuries.\n\nStill, this story of the Minnesota native with the smooth left-handed swing who played for the Twins the entire time sure was made for a movie.\n\nSix weeks after Mauer symbolically donned his catcher's gear for one last crouch behind the plate in the final inning of the season , Mauer formalized his goodbye to the game at a tear-filled-yet-cheerful news conference to wrap up a 15-year major league career at age 35.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to have the personal accolades, and I really do believe that's a byproduct of how the team does, and those things just come along with it,\" Mauer said. \"But I'd want to be known as a great teammate, a great person, and a guy who gave it everything he had.\"\n\nEven the closing credits were memorable.\n\nMauer carefully flipped through a stack of note cards over a 15-minute thank-you on Monday to the people he's closest to with a stack of tissues in front of him on the podium. He needed them immediately, when the mention of his parents, Jake and Teresa, caused his eyes to water and his voice to waver.\n\n\"You helped keep me grounded and never let me forget my roots,\" said Mauer, who began honing his skills at the sandlots and rec centers of St. Paul, less than 10 miles from the big league ballparks in Minneapolis he first began playing in at age 20 to open the 2004 seasons.\n\nThat's the same city where Hall of Fame members Jack Morris, Paul Molitor and Dave Winfield were raised. Mauer's final tally of 2,123 hits might ultimately leave him short of the call to Cooperstown, but he was clearly on that track over the first 10 years of his career considering he hit .323 with an .873 on-base-plus-slugging percentage until a concussion in 2013 forced him to move out from behind the plate and become a first baseman. Mauer is the only American League catcher to win a batting title, a feat he accomplished three times: 2006, 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe six-time All-Star finished with a .306 lifetime average\n\n\"The naysayers will talk about maybe not enough career numbers, a little decline at the end ... but there's going to be a lot of numbers that put him right in the mix with some of the Hall of Famers,\" Molitor said. \"So I'm obviously a little bit biased. I'd love to see it happen.\"\n\nThe latest concussion in May that kept him out for a month, Mauer said, caused him to seriously consider retiring for the first time. The expiration of his eight-year, $184 million contract in October created a natural parting, but the long-term effect of head injuries and his dedication to family weighed much heavier than an MLB-best .407 batting average this year with runners in scoring position.\n\nThe respect for Mauer was evident with the appearance of former Twins managers Molitor, Ron Gardenhire and Tom Kelly and ex-general managers Terry Ryan and Bill Smith. Molitor was fired last month and replaced by Rocco Baldelli, who also showed up.\n\nSo did Mauer's former teammates Glen Perkins, Justin Morneau and Corey Koskie. His coach at Cretin-Derham Hall High School, Jim O'Neill, who taught him to never swing at the first pitch, was there. His maternal grandparents, who attended all but about a dozen of his home games with the Twins, a staggering total of approximately 1,200, attended as well.\n\nWith his wife, Maddie, due any day with the couple's third child, Mauer's focus for now will be on husband and father rather than fielding and hitting. He said he'll stay connected to his hometown team in some capacity and will, in case there were any question, raise his kids in Minnesota.\n\nRyan sat in the front row of the packed room in the basement of Target Field as Mauer expressed his gratitude for the decision to draft him in 2001 with the first overall pick instead of Mark Prior or Mark Teixeira.\n\n\"There were a lot of great options out there, but I'm so thankful you had the confidence in me, and it means more to me than you'll ever know,\" Mauer said.\n\nMaking so much money and missing so many games soured the cynical portions of the fan base on Mauer, but even if he had stayed healthy like Cal Ripken Jr. and hit home runs like Harmon Killebrew he would have carried immense pressure playing in his home territory.\n\n\"I knew what it was like for me, and it was times 100 for him,\" said Perkins, another Minnesota native who spent his whole career with the Twins.\n\nIn the end, Mauer's maturity and poise stuck with his admirers as much as his keen eye and textbook swing.\n\nMorneau, who was Mauer's closest friend on the Twins during the 10 seasons they played together, recalled hitting a home run during an afternoon game in 2006 while playing with a bit of a hangover from an outing at a St. Paul bar the night before. Mauer wasn't so impressed.\n\n\"I said, 'How can you argue with that?'\" Morneau said, smiling. \"And he said, 'How do you know if you weren't hung over you wouldn't have hit two homers?' And I said, 'You know what? He's got a point.'\"\n\nMorneau went on to the AL MVP award that year. Mauer won it three seasons later.\n\n\"He was as special a hitter as you could watch,\" Morneau said, \"and I had the best seat in the house for a long time.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, file) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 The most productive four-game stretch of his career has put Stanley Morgan Jr. in position to leave Nebraska as the greatest receiver in program history.\n\nThe senior has caught 32 passes for 463 yards and six touchdowns to help the Cornhuskers (3-7, 2-5 Big Ten) win three of their last four games after an 0-6 start.\n\nMorgan has 178 receptions for 2,599 yards in his career and needs just four more catches and 91 yards in the last two games to pass Kenny Bell as the Huskers' all-time leader in both categories. Another 144 yards would make him the school's first player with 1,000 receiving yards in a season.\n\n\"It's a humble feeling,\" Morgan said Monday. \"Just to see all the hard work is coming to pay off for me. It's a miracle moment for me, and I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.\"\n\nMorgan was targeted nine times in this past weekend's 54-35 win over Illinois , and he caught eight. Two went for touchdowns. Of his 131 yards, 62 came after the catch, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n\"I have all the faith in the world in him,\" quarterback Adrian Martinez said. \"Every time I throw him the ball, I think he's going to catch it.\"\n\nMorgan has blossomed since the start of his junior year. The New Orleans native was prone to dropping passes his first two seasons, and in the spring of 2017 he was charged with marijuana possession in Florida. Prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charge after he completed a treatment program.\n\nWith three of the Huskers' top four receivers gone from 2016, he nearly doubled his production and caught 61 passes for 986 yards and 10 touchdowns. He led the Big Ten with 89.6 yards per game and probably would have gone over 1,000 for the season if he hadn't missed a game because of a neck injury.\n\nMorgan decided to take his chances with a new coaching staff and return for his senior season. He was named a team captain, a tribute to how far he's come.\n\n\"Stan is someone who comes to work every day with a smile,\" fellow captain and offensive lineman Jerald Foster said. \"He's someone who's energized and wants us to do our best, not only himself. On the sideline, he's the one pumping everyone up, from the defensive side all the way to the offensive. I'm really excited to see these last two games. I know he's going to give out all of his effort just like the rest of us and hopefully he'll be able to break (records) and go out with a big bang for his last two games at Nebraska.\"\n\nMorgan, who goes into this week's home game against Michigan State (6-4, 4-3) with 59 catches for 856 yards and seven touchdowns, is in line to be the fourth Nebraska receiver taken in an NFL draft since 2011.\n\nAs for breaking the school records, Morgan has Bell's full support. Bell, whose last season was in 2014, was on hand for the Illinois game, and he and Morgan chatted beforehand.\n\n\"He told me to go get the record and be my best,\" Morgan said. \"That shows the bond and brotherhood we have with each other.\"\n\nEven if Morgan passes Bell, he knows his time at the top of the charts could be limited. Sophomore JD Spielman has caught 66 balls for 818 yards this season, and he's the fastest player in program history to record 100 career catches. He's only 951 yards behind Morgan in career yards with two years to play, unless he leaves school early.\n\n\"That's why I've got to get it and enjoy it for this time,\" Morgan said, \"because I know guys like JD and these guys they're recruiting are going to shatter those records.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Like Auburn, like Alabama, we're going to take UMass the same way.\"\n\nGeorgia has won three straight games, including against No. 15 Florida and No. 20 Kentucky, since its only loss at No. 10 LSU on Oct. 13.\n\nThe Bulldogs' biggest motivator the next two weeks is to protect their national championship hopes. Quarterback Jake Fromm doesn't want to see the Bulldogs stumble against UMass.\n\n\"The team has definitely taken strides right now,\" Fromm said. \"You can tell with the caliber of opponents we've been playing and how well we've been able to run the ball and play as a team. The defense has been playing real well now stopping the run and getting off on third down. Let's just keep going, keep chopping away at it and hopefully it can pay off for us.\"\n\nThis could be a week where Smart gives more playing time to backup players, though he said, \"I think that's a large assumption.\"\n\nApparently that assumption has made its way through the roster.\n\n\"I've heard the buzz a little bit about young guys being excited to play,\" Simmons said. \"...

USA TODAY\n\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (12) walks off the field after losing to the Tennessee Titans at Nissan Stadium. (Photo: Jim Brown, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNo play sequence from the Patriots\u2019 stunning loss to the Titans on Sunday better encapsulated the state of the defending AFC champs than did the gadget call on an early fourth-quarter third down.\n\nTom Brady took the snap and executed the handoff to James White just fine. White ran to his left and then flipped the ball to Julian Edelman to the right as Brady went out for the pass. Brady caught the ball but stumbled to the ground short of the first down.\n\nThe Patriots just didn\u2019t have their usual way against the Titans, who one play later ran the exact same play and saw their quarterback, Marcus Mariota, gain 21 yards on his reception. Throughout the game, the NFL\u2019s gold standard franchise couldn\u2019t find their groove on offense or defense and were embarrassed in a 34-10 defeat, dropping the team to 7-3 on the season.\n\nThe Titans exposed some of New England's weaknesses. But the Patriots are the Patriots. The loss to the Titans will not derail their season. And because of a lack of competition in the AFC East, New England should still roll to a record 10th straight division title.\n\nBut due in part to their latest defeat, the Patriots very well could find themselves in a precarious situation when it comes to playoff seeding.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 10 of the 2018 NFL season\n\nMore: NFL Week 10 winners, losers: Rams defense can be counted on, time for Jets to make change\n\nMore: Eagles' reality check against Cowboys reveals a team in crisis\n\nSix games remain for New England, but if the playoffs ended today, Bill Belichick and Co. would hold the third seed in the AFC. That would mean no first-round bye and, more importantly, no home-field advantage in the division or conference championship rounds.\n\nHaving the top seed has always mattered greatly to the Patriots. The paths to each of their last five Super Bowl appearances have featured home victories in the AFC Championship Games. Meanwhile, they have lost in the last three conference title games that they played on the road.\n\nCatching up to the AFC's top contenders could be extremely difficult.\n\nLeading the pack is Kansas City (9-1). The Patriots edged the Chiefs in Foxborough, so they hold the head-to-head tiebreaker. But they still trail by two games. New England's final stretch features a pair of meetings with the hapless Jets and a game apiece against the Dolphins and Bills. But potentially challenging matchups with the Vikings and Steelers also await New England. If they hope to catch the Chiefs, the Patriots will likely need some help.\n\nCatching the Steelers for the second seed might be a more realistic a goal for the Patriots. With dates against the Patriots, Chargers and Saints, Pittsburgh has one of the most challenging remaining schedules of any team in the league.\n\nBut given New England struggled against the strong pass-rushing attacks of Tennessee, Detroit and Jacksonville earlier this season, the Steelers don\u2019t represent the most favorable matchup for the Patriots.\n\nUnlike the Patriots, who at times seem to have identity issues, the Steelers know who they are and how they want to beat you. They boast the No. 8 defense in the league and the fourth-best offense. They present a physical rushing attack with James Conner and a big-play passing attack thanks to Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nThat sounds like the kind of squad that could give the Patriots all sorts of problems and threaten their chances of reaching the Super Bowl for a third consecutive year.\n\nThe ax falls in Cincinnati\n\nThree straight games of surrendering 30-plus points and 500 yards resulted in a pink slip for Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. Once regarded as a promising head coaching candidate, Austin instead joined Marvin Lewis\u2019 staff this past offseason but lasted just nine games.\n\nSunday\u2019s 51-point, 509-yard outing by the Saints was the last straw for Lewis, who has now fired a coordinator during the season in each of the last two years. In 2017, Lewis fired offensive coordinator Ken Zampese after an 0-2 start.\n\nIn-season coordinator firings don't always spark a turnaround. But firing Zampese and handing the offense to quarterbacks coach Bill Lazor did help get the Bengals\u2019 attack on track last season. But there will be no in-house promotions to replace Austin, as Lewis is taking over the defense himself.\n\nIt appears that Lewis understands the sense of urgency at hand. The Bengals are 5-4 and remain in contention for a wild-card berth. Cincinnati travels to take on a desperate Ravens team on Sunday and has meetings with the Chargers and Steelers ahead as well.\n\nLewis has eliminated a potential scapegoat by firing Austin with seven games left in the season. Now, it\u2019s all on him.\n\nJets sticking with Bowles\n\nDespite an embarrassing blowout win by the Bills, who were led by recently signed quarterback Matt Barkley, the Jets will stick with head coach Todd Bowles for now, according to multiple reports.\n\nA firing would not have surprised anyone, especially after cornerback Morris Claiborne said on Sunday players \u201claid down\u201d against the Bills. But in-season dismissals aren\u2019t the Jets\u2019 style. They likely know a change must be made, and Bowles should know his time is probably up. But for owners Christopher and Woody Johnson, there's little to be gained by making a move now.\n\nNew York needs to do more than change its head coach, however. Outside of young quarterback Sam Darnold, this roster features very few building blocks. It\u2019s debatable whether general manager Mike Maccagnan, who has produced just one winning season since taking over in 2015, is the man to lead such a rebuild.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "There\u2019s a lot of finger-pointing and anger in New York after the Jets got blown out by the hapless Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nThat includes the franchise\u2019s former coach Rex Ryan, who went on ESPN\u2019s Get Up! and declared it might have been the worst defeat in the team\u2019s history.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t pin the blame solely on head coach Todd Bowles:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right (Bowles) is going to get fired. So is everyone else. I love you have the GM sitting back, talking about the future. What future do you have, do you honestly thing you have? \u2026 They\u2019ve already given you a chance, you had all the money and all that type of stuff. Didn\u2019t we have that like four years ago when Todd took over, when they saved all the money when I was there? I get it. What are you going to do, build it with a bunch of old guys and now you\u2019re going to get another shot? No.\u201d\n\nHmm, I know of one former Jets coach with some fire who might be a candidate to replace Bowles \u2026", "CLOSE Michelle Obama's new memoir \"Becoming\" will give readers their most intimate look yet at the life of the former first lady.

Obama's new role was undefined and sometimes perplexing, \"a strange kind of sidecar to the president.\"\n\nClinton was candid about her own missteps. She told her successor that \"she'd misjudged the country's readiness to have a proactive professional woman in the role of First Lady,\" Obama writes. \"She'd tried to do too much too quickly, it seemed and had run straight into a wall.\"\n\nDuring the next eight years, she said, \"I myself tried to be mindful of that wall.\"\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the 2012 International Women of Courage Awards ceremony in Washington, D.C., on March 8, 2012.

Even royal feet can hurt.\n\nAt her first dinner at Buckingham Palace, the first lady found herself chatting with Queen Elizabeth II. \"You're so tall,\" the queen noted. (Indeed, the queen is about 5-foot-4; Obama is 5-foot-11.) \"Well, the shoes give me a couple of inches,\" she replied.\n\nThe queen glanced at Obama's black Jimmy Choos and shook her head. \"Those shoes are unpleasant, are they not?\" she asked. The first lady acknowledged that her feet hurt. The queen said her feet, clad in black pumps, hurt, too.\n\n\"We were just two tired ladies oppressed by our shoes,\" Obama writes. She then put a hand affectionately across the queen's shoulder \u2014 unbeknownst to her, a breach of protocol that would spark a firestorm.\n\n3. Giving Secret Service the slip.\n\nThe first lady had to twist her mother's arm to persuade her to move from the South Side of Chicago to the third floor of the White House. She and her daughters needed her there, she told her. Marian Robinson reluctantly agreed, but she waived Secret Service protection. She would come and go as she wished, out the gates to the local CVS and to Filene's Basement, which happened to be in the National Press Building, not that reporters ever seemed to notice.\n\nWhen strangers would comment that she looked exactly like Michelle Obama's mother, she would shrug and say, \"Yeah, I get that a lot.\"\n\nMichelle Obama and Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on April 1, 2009, bonding over uncomfortable shoes.

The horrors of Sandy Hook.\n\nDuring their eight years in the White House, the only time President Obama asked his wife to come to the Oval Office in the middle of a workday was just after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. \"Usually, work was work and home was home, but for us, as for many people, the tragedy at Newtown shattered every window and blew down every fence,\" she writes. \"When I walked in to the Oval Office, Barack and I embraced silently. There was nothing to say. No words.\"\n\nMore: Oprah Winfrey picks Michelle Obama's memoir 'Becoming' for her book club\n\nMore: Michelle Obama: How to succeed in politics, even if you don't really like it\n\nMore: 'Becoming Michelle Obama': What we learned from the former first lady's ABC News interview\n\n5. A South Lawn nightmare.\n\nObama recounts a nightmare she had in the White House. She dreamed that someone \u2013 a man named Lloyd, from an agency not identified \u2013 had set up a petting zoo on the South Lawn for the Obama family to enjoy. Amazingly, there was a lion, a tiger, a panther and a cheetah. They had been sedated to make them safe to walk among, he assured the family.\n\nBut when they did, the cheetah bolted. \"We've got a contingency plan for exactly this scenario!\" Lloyd assured her. Secret Service agents fired guns loaded with tranquilizer darts \u2013 hitting daughter Sasha in the right arm. \"This is your plan?\" Michelle Obama screamed. \"Are you kidding me?\"\n\nShe then woke up.\n\n(L-R) Marian Robinson, Malia Obama, Sasha Obama and first lady Michelle Obama attend an exhibition game between the Cuban national baseball team and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in Havana, Cuba on March 22, 2016.

A resource for biographers?\n\nIn the acknowledgements, the first lady says she didn't keep a journal, but she did sit down twice a year with a friend, Verna Williams, now at the University of Cincinnati College of Law. Their recorded conversations generated about 1,100 pages of transcripts about her years at the White House \u2013 perhaps a resource for future study.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2018/11/12/becoming-michelle-obama-even-queens-shoes-hurt-and-5-more-things-we-didnt-know/1978954002/", "With the season past the midway point, let\u2019s see how the playoff picture is shaping up. From now on, we\u2019ll take a look at it every week until the playoffs begin.\n\nAFC\n\n1. Kansas City Chiefs (9-1)\n\nKansas City managed to avoid overlooking the lowly Cardinals on Sunday, pulling out a rather ho-hum 26-14 victory. Next Monday night, the Chiefs take on the high-powered Rams in what on paper has the potential to be the most exciting regular-season game of the year so far\u2014and a potential Super Bowl matchup.\n\n2. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-2-1)\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s 52-21 blowout of Carolina combined with New England\u2019s loss moved the red-hot Steelers up a spot in the AFC playoff standings. Ben Roethlisberger (22 of 25, 328 yards, 5 TDs) and company have now won five straight games.\n\n3. New England Patriots (7-3)\n\nNew England\u2019s road woes continue. After falling apart in a 34-10 loss to the Titans on Sunday, the Patriots are now 2-3 away from Gillette Stadium this year. If the season ended today, they wouldn\u2019t earn a first-round bye, which they\u2019ve had in each of their five Super Bowl-winning campaigns.\n\n4. Houston Texans (6-3)\n\nBack from its bye week, Houston takes on Washington this Sunday. Beating the Redskins would be huge. Of the Texans\u2019 remaining six opponents after that, only one\u2014the Titans\u2014currently has a winning record.\n\n5. Los Angeles Chargers (7-2)\n\nLos Angeles defeated Oakland, 20-6, in underwhelming fashion. But it was still a win. If they want to stay in the AFC West race, the Chargers must keep pace with the Chiefs. The teams play on December 13.\n\n6. Cincinnati Bengals (5-4)\n\nLet\u2019s not mince words: The Bengals looked putrid on Sunday. The Saints demolished them, 51-14. Still, Cincinnati\u2019s next three games, against the Ravens, Browns, and Broncos, appear to be very winnable.\n\nNFC\n\n1. Los Angeles Rams (9-1)\n\nThe Rams rebounded from their loss to the Saints by edging Seattle, 36-31, but it was a Pyrrhic victory. L.A. lost receiver Cooper Kupp to a serious knee injury. He\u2019ll likely be out for the rest of the season.\n\n2. New Orleans Saints (8-1)\n\nNew Orleans, which drubbed the Bengals, 51-14, look like a juggernaut right now. The Saints could move up to the top spot in the playoff standings if they can beat Philadelphia this week and the Rams lose to the powerhouse Chiefs.\n\n3. Chicago Bears (6-3)\n\nAfter falling to the Patriots on October 21, Chicago has quietly won three straight games, including Sunday\u2019s 34-22 victory over the Lions. Mitch Trubisky had an big day, completing 23 of 30 passes for 350 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears host division rival Minnesota this week.\n\n4. Washington Redskins (6-3)\n\nDecimated by injuries, Washington still found a way to beat the Buccaneers, 16-3. Let\u2019s see if the up-and-down Redskins can take care of business against the Texans this week.\n\n5. Carolina Panthers (6-3)\n\nAfter getting blown out by the Steelers last Thursday night, Carolina looks to get back on track this week. Luckily for the Panthers, they\u2019re playing the Lions, who have lost three straight games, by an average of 13.7 points per contest.\n\n6. Minnesota Vikings (5-3-1)\n\nComing off a 24-9 win over the Lions, on tap for the Vikings is a key matchup against NFC North rival Chicago at Soldier Field.

NFL players leave football and, for a many of them, they hate the game. Nobody wanted to get involved in the lawsuit. They want to stay connected to hockey.\"\n\nThe max a former NFL player is entitled to is $5 million and that settlement covered more than 20,000 players with an estimated cost to the league in excess of $1 billion. The NHL settlement includes only 318 players who will get up to $22,000 \u2014 roughly 3% of the minimum salary for a current NHL player \u2014 and each is entitled to medical testing and treatment of up to $75,000 each.\n\nOnly 146 former players put their names to this litigation, a list that included Steve Montador, a former Chicago Blackhawks player diagnosed with the debilitating brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) after his death in 2015. Another 172 players\u2019 names were made public as part of the agreement agreed to after about a year of mediation.\n\nMore: NFL players with brain trauma receive notice of settlements stripped to nothing\n\nThat\u2019s far less than the more than 4,000 former players or their families who sued the NFL. Unlike the NFL list dotted with Hall of Famers, the list of former NHL players lacked such star power with many of the names only recognizable to the most hardcore fans.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think we tried?\u201d Zimmerman responded when asked about why none of the NHL\u2019s former greats were included in the litigation.\n\nThe case took a hit in July when a federal judge in Minnesota denied Zimmerman\u2019s bid for class-action status. Had it been successful, more than 5,000 players would have been included.\n\nZimmerman said despite the setback \u201cit was a good settlement.\u201d\n\nAlong with the the medical treatment and testing covered by the NHL, the players involved in the settlement do not have to pay legal fees. There\u2019s also a common good fund that will be established to aid retired players, including those who have not sought a case against the NHL. Zimmerman said the size of that fund had not yet been determined.\n\nPlayers can opt out of the tentative settlement, although if a good portion do so the NHL could terminate the agreement.\n\n\u201cThe clause just protects the NHL, which likely won\u2019t terminate if just a few retired players don\u2019t take the deal,\u201d sports law attorney Daniel Wallach said. \u201cThe right would likely be exercised if large numbers of retired players don\u2019t take the deal.

The Bills won 41-10. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Todd Bowles is staying put as coach of the New York Jets.\n\nFor now, at least.\n\nIt was business as usual Monday for Bowles, whose job status appeared extremely shaky after the Jets' embarrassing 41-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday , their fourth consecutive defeat that dropped the team to 3-7.\n\n\"We picked a bad day to have a bad day,\" Bowles said during a conference call.\n\nNo doubt about it.\n\nFans at MetLife Stadium booed the team throughout and chanted for the Jets to fire Bowles. That sentiment was echoed by many fans on social media and sports radio Monday morning. Several published stories also speculated that the time to make a change would be now with the Jets heading into a bye-week break.\n\nInstead, owner Christopher Johnson opted to not fire Bowles.\n\nThe two were scheduled to have their usual Monday meeting later in the day, but no change in Bowles' status was expected.\n\n\"What gives me faith that I'm the right guy? I coach football,\" Bowles said. \"As a coach, you go back to the drawing board. And that's what I'm going to do. We'll come back and we'll prepare better and get ready for the next one.\"\n\nFor many, it's a surprise that there will even be another game for Bowles to coach with the Jets.\n\nHe is 23-35 during his run with the Jets, a .397 winning percentage that is better than just one coach in franchise history with at least 30 games in charge: Rich Kotite (.125). And, as anyone familiar with the team knows, that's one name you'd prefer to not be associated with.\n\nThe Kotite years, when New York went 4-28 during the 1995-96 seasons, are synonymous with losing. It's not nearly as bad with Bowles. But there hasn't been much winning, either.\n\nThe Jets got off to a promising start under Bowles, who guided New York to a 10-6 record in 2015 but fell a win shy of the playoffs in his first season \u2014 losing a win-and-in game against Buffalo in the regular-season finale. Many expected the Jets to take the next step under the coach, who was considered a terrific defensive mind in stops in Miami, Philadelphia and Arizona.\n\nIt hasn't happened.\n\nConsecutive 5-11 seasons followed, and now there's this increasingly dismal one, in which even five wins might be tough to come by. And, Bowles doesn't need to look far to point blame.\n\n\"I take all of it,\" he said.\n\nThat's the noble approach, but there's plenty of culprits: playing a rookie quarterback in Sam Darnold; a struggling offense under coordinator Jeremy Bates; a wildly inconsistent defense and a lack of overall roster depth \u2014 something that is a big strike against general manager Mike Maccagnan.\n\n\"I don't talk about my job status, but we know we get paid in this league to win football games,\" he said. \"We're 3-7 and we've got to do a better job.\"\n\nThe fan base is understandably frustrated and restless, and keeping things status quo will do little to appease those who wanted to wake up Monday morning to the news that Bowles was gone.\n\nSo, the fired-up criticisms at the stadium and on the airwaves will continue, and Bowles knows it.\n\n\"It's not my first rodeo,\" he said. \"When you win games, people cheer. When you lose games, people boo. I get it. It's part of sports.\"\n\nIn some respects, it would have been a bigger surprise if the Jets had fired Bowles at this point. Parting ways with a head coach in the middle of the season is rare for the franchise, and has never happened since Woody Johnson purchased the team in 2000.\n\nThe last in-season coaching change for the Jets came in 1976, when Lou Holtz resigned with one game remaining. The last coach to be fired was Charley Winner in 1975, when he was replaced by Ken Shipp for the final five games.\n\nChristopher Johnson, who is running the team while his brother has the role of U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, apparently believes it's better to see the rest of the season through with Bowles and make the final decision on the coach \u2014 and, perhaps, on Maccagnan \u2014 after the final game.\n\nAfter all, there's no other coach on the current Jets staff with previous NFL head coaching experience. Only wide receivers coach Karl Dorrell has even major college head coaching experience. So there would have been no clear-cut option to take over to finish the season.\n\nThat's not to say there won't be any changes. Bowles wasn't considering shaking up his coaching staff at this point, but wouldn't rule it out.\n\n\"I'll focus on everything,\" Bowles said. \"There's no one thing when you're 3-7 toward the bye. The self-evaluation starts with me, then the coaches, then the players. So, I'll make sure I cover everything.\"\n\nThis could all be moot in seven weeks, of course, when the Jets could \u2014 and likely will \u2014 move forward without Bowles. But until then, he's focused on somehow figuring out how to salvage this rapidly deteriorating season.\n\n\"Yeah, it comes with winning,\" he said. \"Winning turns things around.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Pittsburgh Steelers (6-2-1)\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s 52-21 blowout of Carolina combined with New England\u2019s loss moved the red-hot Steelers up a spot in the AFC playoff standings. Ben Roethlisberger (22 of 25, 328 yards, 5 TDs) and company have now won five straight games.\n\n3. New England Patriots (7-3)\n\nNew England\u2019s road woes continue. After falling apart in a 34-10 loss to the Titans on Sunday, the Patriots are now 2-3 away from Gillette Stadium this year. If the season ended today, they wouldn\u2019t earn a first-round bye, which they\u2019ve had in each of their five Super Bowl-winning campaigns.\n\n4. Houston Texans (6-3)\n\nBack from its bye week, Houston takes on Washington this Sunday. Beating the Redskins would be huge. Of the Texans\u2019 remaining six opponents after that, only one\u2014the Titans\u2014currently has a winning record.\n\n5. Los Angeles Chargers (7-2)\n\nLos Angeles defeated Oakland, 20-6, in underwhelming fashion. But it was still a win. If they want to stay in the AFC West race, the Chargers must keep pace with the Chiefs. The teams play on December 13.\n\n6. Cincinnati Bengals (5-4)\n\nLet\u2019s not mince words: The Bengals looked putrid on Sunday. The Saints demolished them, 51-14. Still, Cincinnati\u2019s next three games, against the Ravens, Browns, and Broncos, appear to be very winnable.\n\nNFC\n\n1. Los Angeles Rams (9-1)\n\nThe Rams rebounded from their loss to the Saints by edging Seattle, 36-31, but it was a Pyrrhic victory. L.A. lost receiver Cooper Kupp to a serious knee injury. He\u2019ll likely be out for the rest of the season.\n\n2. New Orleans Saints (8-1)\n\nNew Orleans, which drubbed the Bengals, 51-14, look like a juggernaut right now. The Saints could move up to the top spot in the playoff standings if they can beat Philadelphia this week and the Rams lose to the powerhouse Chiefs.\n\n3. Chicago Bears (6-3)\n\nAfter falling to the Patriots on October 21, Chicago has quietly won three straight games, including Sunday\u2019s 34-22 victory over the Lions. Mitch Trubisky had an big day, completing 23 of 30 passes for 350 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears host division rival Minnesota this week.\n\n4. Washington Redskins (6-3)\n\nDecimated by injuries, Washington still found a way to beat the Buccaneers, 16-3. Let\u2019s see if the up-and-down Redskins can take care of business against the Texans this week.\n\n5. Carolina Panthers (6-3)\n\nAfter getting blown out by the Steelers last Thursday night, Carolina looks to get back on track this week. Luckily for the Panthers, they\u2019re playing the Lions, who have lost three straight games, by an average of 13.7 points per contest.\n\n6.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, FIle) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Los Angeles receiver Cooper Kupp is out for the season after tearing a ligament in his left knee, depriving the Rams' offense of a major contributor heading into a showdown with Kansas City.\n\nCoach Sean McVay on Monday confirmed the ACL injury for Kupp, who led the Rams in yards receiving last season. Kupp is likely to have surgery this week.\n\n\"It's a huge loss for our football team,\" McVay said. \"He's such an important part of what we do, and a great football player, great person. It's tough, but fortunately we've got guys that are ready to step up.\"\n\nKupp has 40 catches for 566 yards and six touchdowns this season, providing reliable hands in the slot and a knack for big catches. The former third-round pick from Eastern Washington has been a key contributor to McVay's high-octane passing offense in both of his NFL seasons.\n\nHis absence will be felt right away by the Rams (9-1), who will be without one of Jared Goff's most familiar targets when they face the Chiefs (9-1) in Mexico City next Monday night in one of the biggest games of the NFL's regular season.\n\n\"He's been a valuable piece of our team, and a guy we'll miss,\" Goff said. \"He's a tough guy (with) a tough family, and I know he'll come out stronger through it all.\"\n\nKupp was hurt on a play with minimal contact Sunday in in the fourth quarter of the Rams' 36-31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. An MRI exam confirmed a torn ligament for Kupp, who already missed two games last month with a sprained left knee after going down awkwardly on a horse-collar tackle by Darian Stewart in Denver.\n\nMcVay is optimistic about the Rams' ability to fill Kupp's role with a mix of receivers.\n\nRobert Woods, who leads the Rams with 55 catches, is likely to play more frequently in the slot. Fellow starter Brandin Cooks, who leads LA with 857 yards receiving, is likely to get more balls thrown his way after catching a season-high 10 passes against the Seahawks.\n\nAnd second-year backup Josh Reynolds is certain to get more playing time, particularly against the Chiefs.\n\n\"Josh Reynolds has definitely demonstrated he's more than capable,\" McVay said. \"He is a starting-caliber player, and that's what we'll do moving forward.\"\n\nReynolds has just seven catches this season and just 18 receptions in his 26 career games, but the former Texas A&M star has earned the Los Angeles offense's trust while filling in for Kupp earlier this season. At 6-foot-3, he also provides a different size matchup on the outside compared to the smaller Cooks and Woods.\n\n\"I was sorry to hear about (Kupp) like everybody else,\" Reynolds said. \"I'm just doing my best to fill in there.\"\n\nThe Rams also could get receiver Pharoh Cooper back in their lineup soon. Last season's Pro Bowl kick returner has been sidelined since the season opener with an ankle injury, but McVay indicated the Rams are likely to make a decision this week on activating Cooper from injured reserve.\n\n\"He would physically be able to play right now,\" McVay said. \"In terms of if we decide to activate him back, those are a couple things that we have to talk through.\"\n\nThe Rams have been largely healthy this season, with a few glaring exceptions. Along with Kupp's struggles and Cooper's season-long absence, Los Angeles has been without cornerback Aqib Talib for the past seven games due to an ankle injury that required surgery.\n\nTalib said Monday that he still hopes to return when the Rams face Detroit on Dec. 2 in their first game back from their bye week.\n\nTalib also praised his replacements in the secondary and had encouraging words for fellow starter Marcus Peters, who criticized himself after last week's loss to New Orleans.\n\n\"That's just part of playing DB,\" Talib said. \"I only know one DB who was like perfect all the time, and that's Prime (Deion Sanders). You're going to go through those stretches, but that's why we've got short memories. That's why we play the toughest position on the field.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Clemson left guard John Simpson is excited about the Tigers' latest achievement. He's even more thrilled for what comes next.\n\nSecond-ranked Clemson (10-0, 7-0 Atlantic Coast Conference, CFP 2) clinched its fourth straight ACC Atlantic Division title \u2014 and seventh in 10 years \u2014 with a 27-7 win over No. 22 Boston College on Saturday night.\n\nBut Simpson said the Tigers are focused on accomplishments beyond the division, including staying undefeated to maintain its status in the College Football Playoff poll.\n\n\"We're obviously not done yet,\" he said Monday. \"We still have a lot ahead of us.\"\n\nThe next hurdle in that journey is Duke (7-3, 3-3) at home on Saturday night.\n\nA Clemson victory would complete its second perfect run in ACC play in the past four years since the national runner up team in 2015 started 14-0 before falling to Alabama in the CFP title game.\n\nTigers coach Dabo Swinney has long told staffers and players to enjoy the moment while keeping sight of what's next. Swinney said it's not easy to be expected to succeed and then go do it with team after team looking to take you down.\n\n\"I know people, fans, get caught up in bigger things like playoffs and all that stuff,\" Swinney said. But \"I still remember our first division win (in 2009) and I want to make sure that we enjoy\" clinching the latest one.\n\nNow, though, it's back to work when any loss could mean the end of Clemson's latest playoff run.\n\nAfter Duke, which is nearly a four-touchdown underdog, Clemson faces inconsistent rival South Carolina at home on Nov. 24 before facing the ACC Coastal winner \u2014 right now, Pittsburgh is in the driver's seat \u2014 in Charlotte, North Carolina on Dec. 1.\n\nClemson's offense continues to thrive with young players like freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence a nd sophomore tailback Travis Etienne leading the way.\n\nThere's always concern, co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott said, with newer players of letting up the intensity with the division race complete.\n\nElliott said Clemson's experienced leaders take control of setting expectations and the week-to-week tone of keeping focused and sharp.\n\n\"These guys have big-picture goals in mind,\" Elliott said. \"They understand that in order to accomplish the big-picture goals that you've got to take it one day at a time, one week at a time. The mentality for us is that each game is the biggest week of the season. And they know the fun is in the winning.\"\n\nClemson has certainly shown that down the stretch the past few seasons. The Tigers are 18-3 after October the past four seasons with two of those losses coming to the Crimson Tide in CFP contests.\n\nFreshman receiver Justyn Ross, who's second on the Tigers with five TD catches, said the newcomers entered the program knowing what's expected and don't plan to slip up.\n\n\"We realize we're into a national championship phase, an ACC championship phase,\" Ross said. \"We had fun winning the division, but there's more to come with it so we put that behind us now.\"\n\nClemson left tackle Mitch Hyatt, who set a program record for most snaps, missed much of the Boston College win after a couple of hits that injured his shoulder, Swinney said.\n\nElliott said Hyatt, a senior who passed up a likely high-round NFL selection last year for a final college season, felt better on Monday and would continue to receive treatment.\n\nIf Hyatt can't play, the Tigers would call on five-star freshman Jackson Carman once more. Carman, at 6-foot-5, 345 pounds, was the top high school prospect in Ohio last recruiting cycle. He filled in against Boston College and, in Elliott's view, performed well.\n\n\"You talk about some of the high profile guys that come in the door and they just assimilate into the culture,\" he said. \"That's what leads to success.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I think we need to do a better job of the people playing around him, doing what they're supposed to do so he doesn't get hit. And he needs to do a better job of stepping up in the pocket and getting rid of the ball, which he had several opportunities to do.\n\n\"Some of these hits could be avoided by better execution, and I think that's what we're going to focus on, not trying to take a guy out of the game so he can't improve or do what he needs to do to get better.\"\n\nTagovailoa sat out the fourth quarter against No. 25 Mississippi State and was sacked four times in the game.

Mayfield threw a season-high three touchdown passes as the Browns ended a four-game losing streak with their best all-around performance in years. (AP Photo/Ron Schwane, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 From disorganized and dysfunctional to disciplined \u2014 and according to rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield, dangerous.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns are looking a lot better these days.\n\nNot great, but improved. Greatly improved.\n\nTwo weeks after coach Hue Jackson's long overdue firing, the Browns showed a glimpse of a brighter future with their best all-around game in several seasons, a convincing 28-16 victory on Sunday over the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nTaking their cues from Mayfield and interim coach Gregg Williams, whose odds of becoming Cleveland's next full-time coach may not be as ridiculous as they once seemed, the Browns (3-6-1) took apart a team with playoff hopes.\n\nCleveland was balanced on offense, sound defensively and the Browns' special teams avoided the kind of fatal mistakes that led to so many tough losses earlier this season.\n\n\"We just finally put four quarters of football together,\" said safety Damarious Randall. \"Just to see us put it together now shows where this team is pointing and the direction we are going. We are going to keep on building on that and keep fighting.\"\n\nMayfield's leading the charge.\n\nMatched up against one of the NFL's best in Matt Ryan, Mayfield was nearly perfect while outplaying his more celebrated quarterbacking counterpart. Mayfield completed his first 13 passes, finished 17 of 20 for 217 yards and threw three touchdown passes as the Browns posted their largest win since Dec. 13, 2015 \u2014 a span of 44 games.\n\nWhen it ended, with the rare sight of Cleveland fans actually still in their seats cheering and not heading toward the exits, Mayfield met Ryan and shared a hug with Atlanta's star at midfield before filming a promotional selfie video for the team's website and then sprinting off like a 10-year-old and leaping and bumping with Randall in the end zone.\n\nMoments later, Mayfield playfully told reporters he woke up feeling \"pretty dangerous.\" He's been scary over the past four weeks, throwing nine TD passes with just two interceptions and making better decisions.\n\nIt was Mayfield's second game with offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens, the team's running backs coach thrust into the coordinator's role when Todd Haley was fired after Jackson on Oct. 29. Kitchens has catered Cleveland's offense to suit Mayfield's strengths, and his quicker throws have been effective in moving the ball and keeping him safe.\n\nFor the first time this season, the Browns did not give up a sack.\n\nWilliams said the Mayfield-Kitchens pairing will only get better.\n\n\"Both of their styles and both of their personalities, they respect each other,\" Williams said. \"They both understand each other. When that respect is well enough, maybe they might even like each other later on, but there has to be a respect of those and us together with coaches and players that we both are on the same page and we know what we are doing for things to grow. I think Freddie and Baker are doing a great job with that.\"\n\nWilliams, too, should take a bow. In no time, he's made the Browns better.\n\nSometimes brash and boastful, Williams has toned down his public personality while providing strong, needed leadership to a team that had tuned out Jackson after two losing seasons. The Browns are responding to the 60-year-old Williams, who coached Buffalo from 2001-03 and worked his way back up the ranks after he was suspended by the league in 2012.\n\nWilliams laughed hard when asked if the past two weeks have reminded an \"old timer\" he still had what it takes to be a head coach.\n\n\"I never thought it left,\" he said.\n\nBut as far as his future in Cleveland, Williams insists he's not campaigning for the job. At this point, the Browns' play is doing the lobbying for him.\n\nWhen pressed about whether he would like to be the next coach of the Browns, Williams showed a politician's elusiveness.\n\n\"You know what?\" he said on a conference call as the Browns began their bye week. \"I like being employed. I enjoy the head coaching part of it. I enjoy all these parts of it, but understand the big part of what we are doing is we get the players the focus, get me to focus on one day at a time and we have to keep on moving on in the right direction.\"\n\nNOTES: Williams only planned to give his players Tuesday off, but \"threw them a bone\" following the win and gave them Monday as well. The players are free this week with the exception of medical treatments and phone meetings. ... Williams said LT Greg Robinson \"played well\" in his second start, but that doesn't mean he'll stay in the lineup following the bye. Rookie Desmond Harrison started Cleveland's first eight games before being sidelined with an unspecified illness.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Ahead of its release, take a look back at what she's already shared with us. USA TODAY\n\nCredit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nMichelle Obama has some thoughts about how to succeed in politics.\n\nThe former first lady is not a fan of politics in general or certain politicians in particular, she makes clear in her blockbuster memoir, Becoming. The political process is messy and the costs were high for her family, her personal life, her professional ambitions.\n\n\"I didn't much appreciate politicians and therefore didn't relish the idea of my husband becoming one,\" she writes. Before his breakthrough bid for the U.S. Senate from Illinois in 2004, she made him promise, out loud, that he'd leave politics altogether if he lost that race.\n\nBut he won the Senate campaign that year and the two White House campaigns that followed. His remarkable rise gave her a birds-eye view of politics as it's played at the highest levels and for the greatest stakes. Her new book, being published Tuesday by Crown, offers some thoughts about what works.\n\nBecoming Book Jacket Flat Miller Mobley (Photo: Becoming Book Jacket Flat Miller Mobley)\n\nActually, the former Michelle Robinson had some experience with politics, local and presidential, before she ever met Barack Obama. Her father, Fraser Robinson, was a Chicago city worker, a job that carried the expectation he would volunteer as a Democratic precinct worker. One of her best friends at Whitney M. Young High School was Santita Jackson, the oldest child of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988.\n\nMichelle Obama promises, persuasively, she will never follow in the footsteps of Hillary Clinton, a first lady-turned-presidential contender, and run for office herself.\n\nThat said, for the present, here are some of the lessons she's learned.\n\nDefine yourself, or somebody else will\n\nMichelle Obama, left, has the support of Oprah Winfrey for her new book, \"Becoming.\" (Photo: Chuck Kennedy)\n\nFourteen words Michelle Obama said at a Milwaukee event during the opening stages of the 2008 primary campaign created a ferocious blow-back. \"For the first time in my adult lifetime,\" she said, \"I'm really proud of my country.\"\n\nIn her book, she quotes a fuller version of her unscripted remarks, which included a declaration that \"hope is making a comeback\" and the feeling that \"people are hungry for change.\" But critics used that key sentence to portray her as angry and disgruntled, as not really a patriot. It fed the \"angry black woman\" meme that she faced, to her frustration.\n\nThat stereotype was unfair and inaccurate, she thought, but it was still damaging. Campaign strategists David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett staged what she later realized was an intervention, showing her clips of some of her public appearances. She realized she sometimes came across as too serious, too severe, which made it easier for opponents to portray her as \"some sort of pissed-off harpy.\"\n\nShe worked on conveying more warmth. \"If you don't get out there and define yourself,\" she says, \"you'll be quickly and inaccurately defined by others.\"\n\nPay attention to optics. But not always\n\nFour months into his presidency, Barack and Michelle Obama shared a \"date night\" in New York, including dinner at a trendy Greenwich Village restaurant and tickets to a Broadway play. Before their Gulfstream 500 had landed back at Joint Base Andrews that night, though, the Republican Party had released a scathing critique about the cost to taxpayers for their evening out, and at a time the American economy and automakers were still in crisis from the 2008 financial meltdown.\n\n\"I already knew it would be a long time before we did anything like this again,\" she writes, in what seems like a sigh. \"Optics would always rule our lives.\" At one point, when she wanted to get a new haircut with bangs, her staffers decided to first run that earth-shattering stylistic change by the West Wing, just in case.\n\nThat said, there are also times to defy the optics. A few months after the New York trip, she wanted to host a White House Halloween party for children. Axelrod, by then a senior White House adviser, and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs opposed the idea as too showy, too costly. \"The optics are just bad,\" they told her.\n\nThe First Lady was not dissuaded. Axelrod and Gibbs never agreed, but they did give up fighting. A thousand-pound pumpkin was plopped on the South Lawn. A brass band of musicians dressed in skeleton costumes played jazz. A giant black spider hung from the North Portico. And more than 2,000 kids in costume \u2014 princesses, grim reapers, pirates, superheroes, ghosts, football players and more \u2014 lined up for small boxes of M&M's emblazoned with the Seal of the President.\n\n\"As far as I was concerned, the optics were just right,\" she writes.\n\nWarning: Change is hard, and slow\n\nThat was a lesson she attributes to Nelson Mandela.\n\nShe met with the legendary South African leader during a trip to South Africa in 2011, as his health was failing. He had fought apartheid for decades, including imprisonment, to eventually see a new government take root. Change happens slowly, \"not in two years, four years, or even a lifetime,\" she writes. \"We were planting seeds of change, the fruit of which we might never see. We had to be patient.\"\n\nProgress rarely follows a straight line, she notes, and it's more likely to come in inches than by leaps and bounds.\n\n\"[Osama] bin Laden was gone, but ISIS had arrived,\" she writes in summing up the Obamas' years in the White House. Childhood obesity rates seemed to be leveling off, her special cause, but the murder rate in her hometown of Chicago was rising, and not even the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School propelled gun legislation through Congress.\n\nEven Obama's landmark election itself, and the election of Donald Trump as his successor, offered an object lesson in the need for patience and persistence.\n\n\"Our presence in the White House had been celebrated by millions of Americans, but it also contributed to a reactionary sense of fear and resentment among others,\" a hatred that was \"old and deep and as dangerous as ever,\" she writes. \"We lived with it as a family, and we lived with it as a nation.

Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott says rookie quarterback Josh Allen will reclaim the starting job should he be healthy when the team returns from its bye week off. McDermott made the announcement Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, a day after journeyman backup Matt Barkley threw two touchdowns in a 41-10 win at the New York Jets. (AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 It appears as if journeyman quarterback Matt Barkley's successful debut as the Buffalo Bills starter will be limited to one outing.\n\nA day after a 41-10 win at the New York Jets, in which Barkley breathed life into an anemic offense in his first NFL start in nearly two years, coach Sean McDermott on Monday announced rookie Josh Allen will reclaim the starting job once he's healthy.\n\nWith the Bills entering their bye week, there's a very good chance of Allen being back behind center on Nov. 25, when Buffalo (3-7) next takes the field hosting the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\"Josh is our starter when healthy, and his development is important for him and for us as we move forward, getting experience,\" McDermott said. \"You've seen a lot of quarterbacks this season play, and it's important that he gets as many reps as he can get in live game action.\"\n\nOne quarterback who will no longer be in the mix is turnover-prone backup Nathan Peterman, who was released by the Bills later in the day.\n\nAllen is 2-3 as a starter, and has missed four games since spraining his right throwing elbow. The first-round draft pick began testing his arm on Nov. 2, and spent all of last week practicing on a limited basis. He wasn't ruled out from playing against the Jets until Saturday.\n\nMcDermott said Allen continues to make progress and threw passes earlier in the day.\n\nAllen's status, however, doesn't diminish what Barkley accomplished in helping Buffalo snap a four-game skid less than two weeks after signing with the Bills.\n\n\"I liked the look in his eye and the energy he gave our offense,\" McDermott said of Barkley, now on his sixth team in six seasons.\n\nIn being the fourth quarterback to start for the Bills this season, Barkley was the first to complete two touchdown passes, including one to left tackle Dion Dawkins, and finishing 15 of 25 for 232 yards passing. He oversaw an offense that set season-highs in points, total yards (451), yards rushing (212), first downs (23) and converted eight of 16 third-down opportunities.\n\nThe 41 points alone topped the 33 Buffalo combined to score in its previous four games, and marked nearly half of the 96 points the Bills scored through their first nine games.\n\nJust as important, Barkley didn't commit a turnover after Buffalo's quarterbacks combined for 12 interceptions \u2014 three of them returned for touchdowns \u2014 and three lost fumbles in their previous six games.\n\nRookie Robert Foster had three catches for 105 yards receiving in becoming Buffalo's first player to top 100 since Deonte Thompson had 107 in a 30-27 win over Tampa Bay on Oct. 22, 2017.\n\nEven running back LeSean McCoy benefited by scoring twice to end a 10-game scoring drought, dating to last season. With 113 yards rushing, McCoy also topped 100 for the first time since gaining 156 on a snow-covered field in a 13-7 overtime win against Indianapolis last Dec. 10.\n\n\"I knew that I could play in this league,\" Barkley said after improving his career record to 2-5. \"I don't want to be cliche by saying it's like riding a bike, but I've done this for years. I believe I was made to play football, and tonight was just an example of going out there and doing what I was made to do.\"\n\nIn the big picture, the Bills are grooming Allen \u2014 not Barkley \u2014 to be their long-term starter.\n\n\"There's something to be said for energy and momentum and what not, but at the same time I know what Josh can do,\" McDermott said, when asked if he considered sticking with the hot hand in Barkley.\n\nPerhaps, he added, Barkley provided Allen a blueprint of how the Bills can succeed.\n\nAllen showed the telltale signs of being a rookie in going 75 of 139 for 832 yards with two touchdowns and five interceptions in five-plus games before he was hurt. Allen also had 155 yards rushing and three touchdowns, though he was occasionally knocked for being too eager to scramble out of the pocket.\n\nPeterman was released after McDermott said he maintained confidence in the second-year player.\n\nThat wasn't apparent in McDermott's actions in starting Barkley against the Jets, a week after Peterman threw three interceptions in a 41-9 loss to Chicago. Peterman was selected in the fifth round of the 2017 draft out of Pittsburgh and wound up throwing 13 interceptions in nine career appearances, including playoffs.\n\nPeterman began this year as the starter, before losing the job early in the third quarter of a 47-3 season-opening loss at Baltimore.\n\nHe's best remembered for throwing five interceptions in the first half of his first career start in a 54-24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers a little under a year ago.\n\nDerek Anderson is the third quarterback on Buffalo's roster, and has missed two games because of a concussion.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\n'The average age of newly elected Democrats dropped a staggering 7.7 years.'\n\nLiberty smiles (Photo: Jeff Koterba/Omaha (Nebraska) World Herald/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nSeveral candidates, from both major political parties, made history with their victories in last week's elections, recording significant \"firsts\" for minorities and women in American politics.\n\nWomen proved the real winners\n\nBy Casey Burgat, Charles Hunt and Trey Billing\n\nDemocrats regained control of the House of Representatives and are currently projected to finish with about 234 seats to the Republicans' 201. Once the dust settles, the freshman class is projected to be 100 members, four higher than the incoming class in the 2010 Republican red-wave election and on the higher side of historical averages. Forty-one seats are projected to flip party status, and all 27 incumbents who lost their seats were Republican.\n\nDiving deeper into the data, Democratic gains come largely on the backs of Democratic winners who are increasingly younger, browner and definitely more female. The average age of newly elected Democrats, for example, dropped a staggering 7.7 years \u2014 from 53.2 to 45.5 years \u2014 from only one Congress prior. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is slated to be the youngest member at 29 years old. How much will this age phenomenon impact Democratic choices for party leaders where the frontrunners (Nancy Pelosi of California, Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina) are all in their late 70s? We will soon find out.\n\nTalker: CNN's Jim Acosta is now the story, as he likes\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nAlso key to the Democratic victory was their overperformance compared to Hillary Clinton's 2016 margins within their districts. In competitive districts specifically, the average Democrat bested Clinton\u2019s numbers by about five percentage points, enough to put a number of Trump-won districts into Democratic hands and a few marginally Clinton districts out of reach for Republicans.\n\nBut, women proved to be the real winner of the midterms elections. A record high 105 women are projected to be sworn in come January. Ninety are Democrats \u2014 a record for the caucus \u2014 including Kendra Horn (D) of Oklahoma's 5th district, who registered the biggest statistical upset of the night by knocking off incumbent Steve Russell (R). Horn started the night with only a seven percent shot at taking the seat, according to forecasters at FiveThirtyEight.com.\n\nIn the end, the Democratic House gains were less like a blue wave and more like a blue high tide. Democrats took care of business in the House; they won back the majority.

Cupp, New York Daily News: \"Yes, the Democrats took the House, won governors\u2019 mansions in critical states and made other gains. These are significant accomplishments, but they don\u2019t add up to the decisive rebuke the party was hoping for. ... The party in power was supposed to get crushed Tuesday. It most certainly was not. If Democrats choose to spin this as a wave, instead of the reality check it should be, they will lose big time in 2020.\n\nRekha Basu, The Des Moines Register: \"As frustrating as it gets with a president who has dubbed the press the enemy, and news reports as 'fake,' they continue to fulfill their obligation to keep the public informed. And as picked-on as people without power have felt, they've been motivated to run for office, persisting in the face of losses to put forward different agendas. Trump may have his own agenda, but he admires strength. It may just be about winning to him, but now he's facing a wave of diverse newcomers who won. This is where things get interesting.\"\n\nJill Filipovic, The New York Times: \"The women are here, and the expectation is that they will do what women so often do: act as a cleanup crew. ... The women who ran broke a lot of the old campaign rules. They talked about their families. They breast-fed on camera in political ads. They were openly competitive. When they take their seats, though, they will face a different set of expectations from our rule-breaking president, and even from their male colleagues.\"\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/12/freshman-class-congress-looking-younger-female-talker/1974721002/", "CLOSE KFC is now serving chicken and waffles!

Davidson says players lost a lot of leverage from that point.\n\nJohn Vrooman, a sports economics professor at Vanderbilt, says the decision to deny class-action status severely limited potential damages to the NHL owners as well as benefits for players. He called the settlement a \"lopsided victory for the owners.\"\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nOne retired NHL player who was part of the concussion lawsuit against the league is calling a tentative resolution an \"insulting attempt at a settlement.\"\n\nDaniel Carcillo, who played nine NHL seasons and joined the lawsuit in June, posted several messages of displeasure with the settlement on his verified Twitter account. Carcillo urged his fellow former players, \"Do not accept this settlement for the concussion lawsuit,\" citing in part that they'd see the same NHL/NHLPA doctors to determine eligibility for treatment.\n\nCarcillo also tweeted asking Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky for help, saying that \"lack of pressure from former players is a direct result of this insulting attempt at a settlement.\"\n\n___\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nEach player who decides to participate in the settlement of a concussion lawsuit against the NHL would receive a $22,000 payment and the potential for up to $75,000 in medical coverage.\n\nAccording to the settlement document in the case, 146 retired players are eligible because they joined the lawsuit, which was first filed five years ago. The total monetary value is just over $18.9 million, which includes a \"Common Good Fund\" of over $2.5 million for other retired players who are not involved.\n\nPlayers have 75 days to decide to opt in to the settlement. If all 146 players or their estates do not opt-in, the NHL can choose to terminate the settlement.\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nThe NHL and attorneys for retired players have reached a tentative settlement worth roughly $19 million in the biggest lawsuit brought against the league over concussions and other head injuries.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the NHL does not acknowledge any liability for any of the players' claims. The lawsuit, consolidated in federal court in Minnesota and by far the largest facing the league, involves more than 100 former players who accused the NHL of failing to better prevent head trauma or warn players of risks while promoting violent play that led to their injuries.\n\nStuart Davidson, an attorney on the players' side, said the NHL is setting aside about $19 million for the lawsuit. That's significantly less than the billion-dollar agreement reached between the NFL and its former players on the same issue.\n\nAttorneys for the retired players say the settlement would include a cash payment for players who choose to participate; neurological testing and assessment for players paid for by the league; an administrative fund to pay for the costs and up to $75,000 in medical treatment for players who test positive on two or more tests.\n\nThe settlement would also set up a \"Common Good Fund\" available to support retired players in need, including those who did not participate in the litigation. The Forbes document said the found would be $2.5 million.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz (11) walks off the field after being stopped on fourth down as time ran out during the fourth quarter of loss to the Dallas Cowboys at Lincoln Financial Field. (Photo: Eric Hartline, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2013 Look in the mirror.\n\nThat was the gist of Doug Pederson\u2019s message to the Eagles following yet another grand embarrassment on Sunday night, when they provided another gut-wrenching example of just how much things have changed since their remarkable Super Bowl run of last season.\n\nWhat an ugly reflection.\n\nThe Eagles, not to be confused with last year\u2019s version, can\u2019t rely on their defense to close out games. They can\u2019t seem to start games off right. The running game is sporadic. The trick plays don\u2019t click like they used to. The sizzle has fizzled.\n\nShoot, desperate to reignite their hopes to repeat as champions, they couldn\u2019t even beat Dallas.\n\nTalk about a reality check.\n\n\u201cAre we doing enough? Are we giving enough? Each week, it\u2019s s a strain,\u201d Pederson said after the 27-20 loss left the defending champs at 4-5.\n\nPederson\u2019s latest explanation was pretty much old news to those who have followed this team closely. Look in the mirror? Pederson has used that line before this season, and the campaign is only just past the halfway point.\n\nWhat the mirror reveals now is just what it showed repeatedly during a run in which the Eagles not only haven\u2019t won back-to-back games but also have become so feeble on their own turf.\n\nSure, the fans booed at Lincoln Financial Field again on Sunday night as they witnessed another showing of the disturbing pattern for a team that has lost three in a row at home: Stumble early. Rally. Fall short.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 10 of the 2018 NFL season\n\nMore: NFL Week 10 winners, losers: Rams defense can be counted on, time for Jets to make change\n\nAfter clawing back from a 13-3 halftime deficit, the Eagles tied the game at 13, then again at 20. Yet each time they fought back, the Cowboys, powered by the 151 rushing yards from Ezekiel Elliott, responded to put the Eagles back in their hole.\n\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d tight end Zach Ertz said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to put it. We had every opportunity to really put a stamp on a big game.\u201d\n\nDifferent team, different times. The Eagles just don\u2019t have that mojo.\n\nSure, the Eagles still have a shot. Of their seven remaining games, they will play NFC East-leading Washington (6-3) twice. Mathematically, they are still alive. Anecdotally, they look like toast.\n\n\u201cWe have to believe, despite the evidence,\u201d Ertz said.\n\nErtz caught 14 passes for 145 yards and two TDs but came up a yard short on a fourth-down catch in crunch time. He also found himself 9 yards shy of the goal line on the last play before time expired.\n\nDig deeper into the evidence, though, and it's clear an offense that took the NFL by storm last season has fallen back to the pack. Carson Wentz is still an emerging star, evidenced by a few more laser throws on Sunday night, but the problems go far beyond his ugly pick on the Eagles\u2019 first drive that set up a Cowboys field goal.\n\nAfter ranking third in the NFL last season with 28.6 points per game, the Eagles entered Sunday night ranked 21st (22.25 points per game) in scoring. When they get inside the 20, they are merely average. They came into Week 10 ranked 18th for their red zone TD rate (54.8%). Last year, they led the league with 65.5% clip.\n\nThese numbers can be at least partially traced to the running back issues. Last year, Corey Clement and Wendell Smallwood were sweet change-up backs to supplement Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount. Now they team with rookie Josh Adams for a committee, as Ajayi was lost for the season with a torn ACL and Blount left as a free agent.\n\nIt\u2019s not working. The Eagles rushing attack, ranked third last season, dropped to 18th through nine weeks. And there hasn't been a single 100-yard game. On Sunday night, Philadelphia had exactly 100 fewer rushing yards than Dallas. When the team called for an early-game gamble on a fourth-and-1, Adams was stuffed. When it needed 2 yards late in the fourth quarter, Wentz threw a screen to Clement that lost 5 yards.\n\n\"Philly Philly\"? That was so last season. It\u2019s more like Dizzy Philly.\n\nSure, with typical roster turnover, week-to-week NFL injury attrition and other variables, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect a straightforward follow-up of last year's magical season. But that\u2019s the standard that was set. And if the Eagles are to defend that crown \u2013 or at this point, even rally to make the playoffs \u2013 some comparisons are indeed relevant.\n\nRemember that clutch defense? Although the front four still shows signs of dominance, it also was gashed by Elliott. The goal-line stand that preserved the win in the NFC divisional playoff against Atlanta has given way to second-half collapses.\n\nA little more than a month ago, the Eagles' defense was carved up by Kirk Cousins and the Vikings. In Week 7, the defense couldn\u2019t hold up (and the running game couldn\u2019t chew up the clock) as Carolina rallied from a 21-point deficit. On Sunday night, the Eagles let Elliott and the Cowboys produce two 75-yard touchdown drives in the fourth quarter.\n\nNow that defense, further depleted by injuries in the secondary\u2013 cornerback Ronald Darby tore his ACL on Sunday night \u2013 must try to get it together next weekend in the Superdome against the Saints, who boast arguably the NFL's hottest offense.\n\nThe mirror contains quite a message about now: Good luck with it, Eagles.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.", "bad url", "Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge in dejection after Red Star scored a goal during the Champions League group C soccer match between Red Star and Liverpool at the Rajko Mitic stadium in Belgrade, Serbia, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

But at the time the plane was grounded, it had only paid back half of its $1.1 million bill. Ryanair repaid the balance Friday.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led to the inevitable inconvenience of the 149 passengers on board the immobilized plane,\" the DGAC said in a statement to the BBC. \"Those passengers were able to eventually reach their destination later that evening on another Ryanair plane, but with a five-hour delay.\"\n\nThe airline would not comment on the impounded plane to either outlet.

(AP Photo/Ed Zurga) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs finally got Justin Houston back onto the field Sunday against Arizona, and the four-time Pro Bowl linebacker made one of the plays of the game when he picked off Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen on a second-half screen pass.\n\nThe Chiefs also got safety Daniel Sorensen back from injured reserve, where he had resided since breaking his leg in training camp, and he five tackles while providing a hard-hitting presence.\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise the Chiefs defense played the best it has all season.\n\nWith two of their anticipated starters back on the field, the Chiefs held the Cardinals to 260 yards in a 26-14 victory. They sacked Rosen five times, intercepted him twice and even managed to keep David Johnson under 100 yards rushing \u2014 just barely.\n\n\"I feel like the first couple weeks we were putting too much into it, trying too hard,\" linebacker Reggie Ragland said. \"We're having fun with it. Whatever happens, happens. It's football. We've been playing this game for too long for us not to have fun with it. It's a child's game and we're grown men playing it, so have fun with it. Don't worry about all that other stuff.\"\n\nThe Chiefs (9-1) sure looked as if they were having a ball Sunday.\n\nDee Ford had his ninth sack of the season, not to mention three tackles for a loss and four hits on Rosen. Allen Bailey had his fifth sack while Chris Jones had two more to give him a career-high seven for the season, including at least one sack in six consecutive games.\n\nAll told, Rosen was hit 13 times and fumbled once while throwing for just 208 yards and a score.\n\n\"The one thing we're doing right now is we are minimizing big plays,\" defensive tackle Jarvis Jenkins said. \"That is one thing we all play on is minimizing big plays, then getting them one-dimensional so we can rush the passer. I think we did that this game.\"\n\nThe only game in which the defense played nearly as well was Cincinnati, when the Chiefs allowed 239 yards in a 45-10 rout. But it's often easier to play stingy defense when the game has gotten out of hand, and on Sunday the Chiefs needed to show up in a game that Arizona managed to keep relatively close.\n\n\"That's happened a couple of times now, things have stalled out (on offense) then they step up and make plays,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"That's a great thing. We need that as a football team. We need that. It's important.\"\n\nEspecially given who is up next: The Chiefs are headed to Mexico City to face the high-flying Los Angeles Rams on Monday night in a matchup of two of the NFL's most dynamic offenses.\n\nThe Rams are second in yards-per-game and the Chiefs are third, and those rankings are flipped when it comes to scoring with Kansas City second and Los Angeles third.\n\nIn other words, it's a good time for the Chiefs' maligned defense to start showing up.\n\nThey can still get a whole lot better, too. Middle linebacker Anthony Hitchens was out Sunday with bruised ribs, and backup linebacker Frank Zombo missed the game with a hamstring injury, giving undrafted rookie Ben Niemann a chance to start his first NFL game.\n\n\"I was still on four phases of special teams,\" Niemann said, \"so I got a little tired out there. But it was good. You want to play. You want to play as many snaps as possible.\"\n\nSomeone else who wants to play? Eric Berry, the Chiefs' star safety, who still hasn't played since tearing his Achilles' tendon in the season opener last year. Berry practiced throughout the summer and into training camp, but a heel injury has kept him off the field for months.\n\nIt would be another boon for the Chiefs defense if he can return in any effective capacity.\n\n\"Sooner or later, it has to be the defense (stepping up),\" Jenkins said. \"That's part of being a team. You can't be one-dimensional. I think the feeling we have now is it's a good team. It wasn't pretty (Sunday) but we got it done. That's what we have to do.\"\n\nNotes: Reid said Monday he's not concerned about the field conditions at Azteca Stadium, where the combination of concerts and soccer matches have wrecked the turf. \"I've seen it,\" Reid said, \"but I think the NFL is on top of it. They do a great job with all that stuff.\" ... Reid said he doesn't expect Patrick Mahomes to miss practice after his girlfriend's stepfather died suddenly on Sunday. The Chiefs are off on Tuesday and Wednesday. \"He's here this morning and he's got things set there, organized and settled down,\" Reid said, \"so he can do what he's got to do here.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But she may perhaps have a higher calling: Christian ministry.\n\nHer lawyer, Mat Staver, appeared Thursday on \"Crosstalk,\" a conservative radio program, discussing his client's future. Staver co-wrote a book with Davis and said he's spoken with her \"quite a bit\" through the summer.\n\n\"Frankly, I think what she's going to do and where she's been wanting to go is in some form of ministry,\" Staver said. \"And so I think that's where the Lord is leading her at this time.\"\n\nDavis cited \"God's authority\" for refusing to comply with the Supreme Court's gay marriage ruling in 2015, spending five days in jail for ignoring court orders to issue same-sex licenses.\n\nThousands of supporters cheered Davis when she exited the jail after serving her time, including Mike Huckabee, who wrote the foreword to her autobiography, \"Under God's Authority: The Kim Davis Story.\" Davis eventually went on to meet Pope Francis.\n\nFast-forward three years.

(AP Photo/Chris Szagola, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Butler is in Philadelphia, and upon his arrival he immediately began talking about winning a championship.\n\n\"The Process\" has a whole new meaning.\n\nButler, a four-time All-Star forward, is now officially a member of the 76ers, after they and the Minnesota Timberwolves received approval from the league office Monday on the terms of the trade that was agreed to over the weekend.\n\n\"He replicates, he mirrors, the spirit of Philadelphia,\" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. \"He is a fierce competitor. And there is a toughness that he plays with. That's who he is. And he wears it on his face, it's seen in his game, it's confirmed by multiple all-defensive teams and it's a perfect fit for the city and our program defensively.\"\n\nThe deal gives Philadelphia a legitimate \"Big Three,\" with Butler joining All-Star forward Joel Embiid and reigning rookie of the year Ben Simmons on a team that already was expected to be a major Eastern Conference contender this season. Butler flew into Philadelphia on Monday and told NBC Sports Philadelphia that fans should expect \"a guy who wants to win.\"\n\n\"We want a championship,\" Butler said as he signed a couple of autographs before he was driven away from the airport. \"And I think the core group of guys that we have will figure out a way to get it done.\"\n\nButler and Justin Patton were traded to Philadelphia for Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless, along with a 2022 second-round draft pick.\n\nButler will be introduced by the 76ers on Tuesday and is expected to debut with his new club Wednesday at Orlando. Philadelphia was playing at Miami on Monday.\n\n\"We have a championship window that's centered around the continued progression of our talented young core, as well as our ability to add elite players who elevate our program,\" 76ers general manager Elton Brand said. \"In Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, we have two of the NBA's top 20 players. Now, we've added a third top-20 player in Jimmy Butler.\"\n\nThe 76ers won 47 games in a three-season span between 2013 and 2016. They won 28 in 2016-17, made the jump to the playoffs at 52-30 last season and now will be considered an even more serious threat to emerge as the East representative in the NBA Finals.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is piecing all this together,\" Brown said. \"It's not even close. ... I say that completely from an excitement standpoint. This isn't a burden. Sure, it's a responsibility. But I'm excited with piecing this together.\"\n\nButler has averaged 21.8 points per game since the start of the 2014-15 season, the 13th-highest clip in the NBA over that span.\n\nThere are three teams with multiple current teammates averaging at least that many points over those seasons. Golden State has three such players, with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins, though Cousins hasn't played yet this season for the Warriors while recovering from surgery.\n\nOklahoma City teammates Russell Westbrook and Paul George also have averaged that much \u2014 and now, Philly has such a pairing in Butler and Embiid.\n\n\"I think he's going to bring toughness, scoring ability, a veteran,\" 76ers guard Markelle Fultz said. \"Just going to compete on both ends of the floor and I hope he pushes this team to a higher level.\"\n\nButler is the obvious headliner to this trade, though there will be some adjustments for the 76ers to make now that the deal is finally done.\n\nSaric and Covington were key players for Philadelphia, combining to make 398 starts including playoffs for the 76ers during their time with the club. Saric averaged 13.5 points with the 76ers over parts of three seasons, while Covington averaged 12.9 points during his five seasons with Philly. They were the starting forwards for the 76ers in nearly every game last season, when Philadelphia had its best record since 2000-01 \u2014 the last time that the franchise went to the NBA Finals.\n\n\"We're excited to have these guys come in,\" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"With Robert and Dario, that they've started on a good team, they'll help.\"\n\nThe deal between the teams was struck on Saturday, though it couldn't become official until the trade call Monday.\n\nIt ends a two-month saga during which there was no doubt that Butler was going to get traded out of Minnesota. He told the Timberwolves shortly before training camp that he wanted to be moved, which forced Minnesota's hand because it was obvious that Butler would not re-sign next summer. So the options were to move him for something, or lose him for nothing.\n\n\"He loves to win,\" Fultz said. \"He's going to do whatever it takes to win.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She helped Minnesota reach the Final Four her senior year.\n\nIt only took one win to get her team ranked in her first year as coach as the Gophers entered the poll at No. 25 on Monday. It's the first ranking for the school since 2015.\n\n\"We didn't really talk about a ton,\" Whalen said about getting ranked. \"We just wanted to get off to a good start the first game and get a lot of fan support.\"\n\nThe opening win over New Hampshire on Friday drew more than 14,000 fans.\n\n\"It's only one game and we have a lot of work to do,\" she said.\n\nMinnesota has a favorable schedule with just one road game \u2014 Wednesday at Xavier \u2014 over the next month.\n\n\"The good thing is we have one road game where we get the rhythm of what it's like to go on the road,\" Whalen said. \"Then we have a long stretch at home before we go to Boston College. Win your home games and you have a chance to have a successful season.\"\n\nWhalen became the 39th person to play and coach a team that was ranked when her alma mater entered the poll at No. 25. Whalen is the 12th to do it at the same school.\n\nWhile Minnesota entered at No. 25, most of the poll was relatively unchanged. Notre Dame, UConn, Oregon, Baylor and Louisville still are the top five teams. The Irish are no longer a unanimous choice by the 31-member national media panel.

The Irish then visit No. 15 DePaul on Saturday.\n\nCONFERENCE SUPREMECY: The Southeastern Conference has six ranked teams. The Pac-12 and ACC had five and the Big Ten three. The American, Big East and Big 12 each have two.\n\nFALLING BLUE DEVILS: Duke saw its run of 35 straight weeks ranked end on Monday. It was the ninth longest active streak. The Blue Devils have the third longest streak ever in the poll when they were ranked for 312 consecutive weeks before that came to an end in 2016.\n\nTIEBREAKING: While the top 10 teams were unchanged, Texas and Tennessee were no longer tied at 11th.

The Bengals have fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, and put head coach Marvin Lewis in charge of an historically bad unit. The Bengals lost to the Saints 51-14 on Sunday, one of the worst showings in franchise history. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Marvin Lewis got the Bengals' head coaching job because of his reputation for defensive excellence. He's now in charge of trying to resuscitate a historically bad unit and pulling Cincinnati's season back from the brink.\n\nThe Bengals fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday, a day after a 51-14 loss to the Saints that ranks among the worst in franchise history. New Orleans scored on every possession except the last one \u2014 when it took a knee while in field-goal range \u2014 during its rout at Paul Brown Stadium.\n\nThe fading Bengals (5-4) fired a coordinator in midstream for the second season in a row. And it's up to Lewis to get hands-on and try to fix the mess while filling two roles at once.\n\n\"Teryl worked very hard, but I just felt like we have to rock their world, shake things up,\" Lewis said.\n\nThe timing was curious. The Bengals were coming off their bye week that would have given them time to adapt to a change at coordinator. Now, they're changing on the fly while getting ready for a pivotal AFC North game at Baltimore (4-5) on Sunday.\n\nLewis made another interesting move, re-hiring fired Browns coach Hue Jackson, who served as his offensive coordinator in 2014 and 2015. Jackson, who was dismissed by Cleveland on Oct. 29 after winning just three games in two-plus seasons, will take on an unspecified role within Lewis' staff, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Monday night.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced Jackson's addition.\n\nThe Bengals host the Browns on Nov. 25.\n\nLewis took the defense aside a few times on Sunday, trying to clear up confusion. While he won't change the defensive schemes, he'll try to bring more clarity to players' responsibilities.\n\n\"They want help: 'Give me something,'\" Lewis said.\n\nThe Bengals have given up at least 500 yards in three straight games \u2014 a first in the Super Bowl era \u2014 and are on pace to give up an NFL record for yards in a season . In the past four games, Cincinnati has allowed 481, 551, 576 and 509 yards.\n\nLewis has one thing in his favor: The schedule is far more favorable the rest of the way.\n\nCincinnati has faced six offenses currently ranked in the league's Top 10 \u2014 Tampa Bay (No. 1), Kansas City (3), Pittsburgh (4), New Orleans (5), Atlanta (6) and Indianapolis (9). Only two are left on the schedule: the Chargers (8) and the Steelers again.\n\nWith three losses in the past four games, Cincinnati has fallen from first place to trailing Pittsburgh (6-2-1) by two games in the loss column. They can't afford to fall any further behind, which was a factor in the firing.\n\n\"They're trying to get things fixed now,\" defensive end Carlos Dunlap said. \"If you weren't paying attention, you're paying attention now.\"\n\nIt's the second time during his 16-season tenure in Cincinnati that Lewis has gotten directly involved in the defense.\n\nThe Bengals hired him in 2003 in large part because of his reputation for defensive coaching \u2014 he coordinated the Ravens' Super Bowl-championship defense in the 2000 season. Defense has been a regular challenge during his tenure.\n\nLewis became so frustrated with the defense in 2004 that he took over play-calling from coordinator Leslie Frazier during a game against Cleveland. The Bengals lost 34-17 and Lewis left the defense in Frazier's hands the rest of the way, and then fired him after the season.\n\nNow, he's back in charge.\n\n\"We're not playing well, so something had to change,\" safety Jessie Bates said.\n\nLewis hired Austin from Detroit after defensive coordinator Paul Guenther left to join Jon Gruden with the Raiders. The Bengals gave up a lot of yards while opening the season 4-1, with the defense scoring four touchdowns off fumble and interception returns to overcome the poor showings overall.\n\nWith injuries sapping the defense during a stretch of games against the NFL's top offenses, the unit imploded. The Saints scored touchdowns on all five first-half possessions Sunday, and moved the ball easily even when they were running out the clock in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bengals matched the club record by giving up 28 points in the second quarter. The 51 points allowed were one shy of the club record.\n\nAustin is the fourth coordinator fired in the NFL this season. Tampa Bay fired defensive coordinator Mike Smith, Arizona fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy, and the Browns fired head coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley.\n\nJackson has a close relationship with Lewis, who has declined to discuss whether he'd bring him back to Cincinnati. Jackson coached on both offense and defense in Cincinnati.\n\nLast year, the Bengals fired offensive coordinator Ken Zampese after an 0-2 start, but the Bengals missed out on the playoffs for the second year in a row. Lewis got a two-year contract extension after the season even though he's 0-7 in the playoffs \u2014 an NFL record for futility.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Duke changed everything about who AP Top 25 voters considered to be the nation's best team with a single dominating performance against a marquee opponent.\n\nIt also gave the Blue Devils yet another milestone under Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski: a record number of appearances at No. 1.\n\nThe Blue Devils jumped from fourth to first Monday in the first regular-season poll, leapfrogging Kansas at the top after a blowout win against then-No. 2 Kentucky last week. That allowed Duke to set a record with its 135th week at No. 1, breaking a tie with UCLA for the most top rankings in poll history.\n\nThe 34-point win against the Wildcats in the Champions Classic to open the season marked the program's most lopsided win against a top-5 opponent. Duke was practically flawless behind star freshmen RJ Barrett, Zion Williamson and Cam Reddish, and that created a buzz about the team's already lofty potential being somehow even higher than anyone anticipated.\n\nGranted, it was one game. And Duke (2-0) didn't look nearly so dazzling Sunday at home against Army . But that one performance caused a major voting shift, even with now-No. 2 Kansas earning a quality win of its own against then-No. 10 Michigan State in the first game of the Champions Classic.\n\nKansas was a solid preseason No. 1 by earning 37 of 65 first-place votes, followed by 19 for Kentucky and four for Duke. But Duke now has 48 first-place votes, claiming the top spot for all 19 voters who had Kentucky as preseason No. 1 while also causing 23 voters to switch from Kansas in the preseason Duke this week.\n\nDuke also prompted switches from the lone voters who had Gonzaga and Villanova at No. 1 in the preseason.\n\nThe hype probably won't slow anytime soon, either. The Blue Devils have everyone's attention.\n\n\"Part of becoming good is keeping the noise out of your locker room,\" Krzyzewski said after the Army win. \"And when something good happens and you have the start of the season ... there's a lot of noise. And for us, it's not always good noise, but in this case, it was exceptional noise. Exceptional noise.\n\n\"When you have four freshmen and we don't have veterans, you have to be more mature about listening to that.\"\n\nAT THE TOP\n\nGonzaga stayed at No. 3, followed by Virginia and Tennessee each climbing a spot to round out the top 5. Nevada, North Carolina, reigning national champion Villanova and Auburn were next, while Kentucky slid eight spots to No. 10.\n\nTOP RISERS\n\nThere weren't any dramatic climbs beyond the Duke-Kansas change at the top. In all, 16 teams moved up this week poll, with No. 14 Florida State and No. 19 Clemson matching Duke's three-spot jump for the biggest of the week.\n\nTwelve of the gains were merely one spot.\n\nLONGEST SLIDES\n\nKentucky's fall was the biggest for any team that stayed in the poll. The others were all modest, with four teams \u2014 Kansas, No. 11 Michigan State, No. 16 Virginia Tech and No. 21 TCU \u2014 falling one spot each.\n\nNEWCOMERS\n\nThere were two new teams in the poll with No. 24 Marquette and No. 25 Buffalo.\n\nIt's the first appearance for Marquette in nearly five years since last appearing at No. 25 in November 2013.\n\nAs for Buffalo, it's the first AP Top 25 appearance in program history. It comes after the Bulls got 43 points and 14 rebounds from CJ Massinburg to beat then-No. 13 West Virginia on the road \u2014 another marquee upset for a team that beat Arizona and eventual No. 1 overall NBA draft pick Deandre Ayton in the first round of last year's NCAA Tournament.\n\nSLIDING OUT\n\nThe Mountaineers slid all the way out after losing to the Bulls, which marked their first loss in a home opener since November 2003.

(Nov. 7) AP\n\nA photo released by the official North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state news agency of North Korea, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (R) shaking hands with United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (L) during their meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea, Oct. 7 October 2018. (Photo: KCNA, EPA-EFE)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 North Korea has at least 13 secret operating bases where the regime is continuing work on its ballistic missile program, a sign Kim Jong Un is not winding down his country\u2019s nuclear program despite public promises touted by the Trump administration.\n\nNew research, conducted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Security, has identified 13 of an estimated 20 North Korean missile operating bases that Kim's regime has not declared.\n\nNorth Korea's highly publicized move to decommission a satellite launch facility gained a flurry of positive media attention. But that move \"obscures the military threat to U.S. forces and South Korea from this and other undeclared ballistic missile bases,\" the CSIS report concludes.\n\nA State Department spokesperson did not address the new findings, but said: \u201cPresident Trump has made clear that should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments \u2013including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs \u2013 a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean officials downplayed the report\u2019s claims on Tuesday, saying that they were nothing new to the intelligence communities in Washington or Seoul.\n\nA spokesman for South Korean president\u2019s office, Kim Eui-kyeom, said that the information about a missile base profiled by CSIS was taken from commercial satellite imagery and that state intelligence agencies already had more in-depth information.\n\n\"The U.S. already knows in much more detail using military satellites,\" Kim said. \u201cAnd [South Korea is] watching closely, but there is nothing new.\u201d\n\nKim also said that the base, called Sakkanmol, was used for short-range missiles only, not intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and that no agreement to dismantle it had been negotiated.\n\n\u201cI do not think it is appropriate to call this a \u2018deception\u2019,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI think it further emphasizes the need for negotiations and dialogue, including North American dialogue, to get rid of these North Korean threats.\u201d\n\nCSIS experts used satellite images to locate the undeclared military bases, which they said could be used \"for all classes\" of ballistic missiles, including intercontinental missiles capable of reaching the United States.\n\nThe findings, first reported by the New York Times, stand in stark contrast to President Donald Trump's declaration that North Korea no longer represents a nuclear threat and that he has made progress is persuading Kim to declare and relinquish his nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe new report emphasizes that the hidden bases are not launch facilities. However, they are \"permanent facilities that contain a unit\u2019s headquarters, barracks, housing, support, maintenance, and storage facilities,\" the report says.\n\nTrump claimed in June that \"there is no longer a nuclear threat\" from North Korea just after he returned to the U.S. from a historic summit meeting with Kim in Signapore.\n\n\"Everybody can now feel much safer,\" Trump tweeted about that meeting with the North Korean dictator. Critics have derided Trump's claims.\n\n\"This idea that they\u2019re giving up their nuclear program is quite a fantasy,\" said Ivan Eland, a national security expert with the Independent Institute, a Libertarian-leaning think tank.\n\nHe and others said revelation that North Korea has continued unabated with its ballistic missile program is no surprise.\n\n\"Kim literally ordered ballistic missiles to be mass produced on New Year\u2019s day 2018,\" Vipin Narang, a professor MIT and expert in nuclear proliferation, said in a tweet on Monday. \"He never offered to stop producing them, let alone give them up. Ever. He is doing exactly what he said he was going to do.\n\nAt the Singapore summit, Trump and Kim signed a vaguely worded agreement in which North Korea promised to work toward a \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d But the North Koreans have not few visible, concrete steps toward fulfilling that pledge.\n\nNorth Korea has not, for example, provided the U.S. with a detailed list of its nuclear arsenal \u2013 which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other U.S. officials see as a vital first step toward denuclearization.\n\n\"Trump just got fleeced at the summit,\" Eland said.\n\nTrump and Kim have agreed to hold a second summit, possibly early next year. But the planning for that meeting seems to have stalled.\n\nMore: Day after summit, Trump claims North Korea 'no longer a nuclear threat'\n\nMore: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo touts progress, with few details, after Kim Jong Un meeting\n\nMore: President Trump says easing sanctions on North Korea is a 'two-way street'\n\nContributing: Thomas Maresca from Seoul.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/12/north-korea-has-least-13-secret-ballistic-missile-bases/1976942002/", "", "", "Bryce Harper\u2019s free agency was expected to be a perfect storm, but at least one of the converging pressure systems appears to have drifted out to sea and left the rest to combine for only a very big storm. There\u2019ll still be plenty of rain made, but perhaps not quite the long-forecasted deluge. This author\u2019s hands feel too heavy from extending this metaphor to maintain it any further. On to the point.\n\nHarper is still Bryce Harper, a 26-year-old six-time All-Star and one of the best hitters in the game. We now understand he is not the best player in the world, but he\u2019s nonetheless a guy in the early part of a Hall of Fame trajectory with an extremely high floor and the tantalizingly high ceiling he showed in his MVP 2015 campaign, and he\u2019s almost certainly the most famous active baseball guy. He\u2019s going to get paid, no doubt.\n\nBut the economy of Major League Baseball has changed in recent seasons, and there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that any big-market team will buck the trend this offseason and blow far past luxury-tax limits to land guys like Harper and Manny Machado. In a report for Yahoo Sports, Jeff Passan explains:\n\nThe Yankees intend to approach the (competitive balance tax) with a mantra that, two sources told Yahoo Sports, goes something like: We didn\u2019t get under it just to blow back past it. The Dodgers\u2019 intentions are laid out even more clearly in a document for potential investors that outlines plans to stay beneath the threshold not just this season but for the next four, according to a Los Angeles Times report. Already the Cubs are projected to carry a $220 million-plus payroll, well past the $206 million threshold for 2019, and entering the Harper sweepstakes \u2014 or even signing a good relief pitcher \u2014 would push them into the second tier of luxury-tax penalties unless they can dump salary\u2026. \u201cIt\u2019s a soft cap,\u201d one large-market executive said.\n\nPassan\u2019s whole post is well worth your time, and includes a ton of important details pertaining to Harper\u2019s free agency and the offseason market in general. Among them: Harper\u2019s agent, Scott Boras, \u201chas forged an increasingly strong relationship with MLBPA executive director Tony Clark,\u201d and, per Forbes, MLB team revenues have increased far faster than the luxury-tax threshold.\n\nA lot of this came up last year, in the first full offseason under the league\u2019s current collective-bargaining agreement, when marquee free-agents lingered on the market until spring training started.\n\nBright-side baseball fans might argue that the competitive-balance tax, to some extent, has done its job. Since the league first implemented a threshold-based tax in 2003, the league\u2019s median payroll has just about doubled \u2014 well outpacing inflation over that same span. And where the Yankees went 12 straight seasons with a payroll more than twice the league median from 2003-2014, no club has done that since the 2015 Dodgers, meaning the payroll gap between the sport\u2019s haves and have-nots has, in fact, slimmed. Plus, there\u2019s justification for avoiding massive commitments to veteran players in free agency, as developing homegrown talent and locking up young players to long-term extensions seems a better model for sustainable success.\n\nBut cynics will point out that if the median payroll increase suggests all teams are making far more money, then the billionaire owners of the big-market clubs are pocketing a bigger share, with the competitive-balance tax and draft-pick compensation providing excuses to avoid sharing more of the wealth with the players. It seems most likely that all of the above are true: The league\u2019s efforts at revenue sharing have helped middle-market clubs compete with the likes of the Yanks, Dodgers and Red Sox in free agency, but the luxury tax acts as a soft salary cap that establishes a top-end payroll limit in a league that never before had one.\n\nNo matter the case, this is and will remain an issue for the players union, something certain to be addressed when the current CBA expires in 2021. And so Harper, if he commits to the type of decade-plus megadeal he\u2019s long been expected to ink this offseason, risks playing most of his contract in a baseball economy wildly different than the one in which he\u2019ll sign the deal.\n\nHarper\u2019s about to face the type of decision most of us can hardly conceive. He has already made $47.9 million in salary in his career, plus plenty more in endorsements undoubtedly, so he is a rich man and should remain so for the rest of his life unless he\u2019s phenomenally stupid with his money. Even a deal like the eight-year, $144 million contract Eric Hosmer signed last offseason will ensure Harper generational wealth, the type of nest egg he can turn into Rock-A-Fella money, if not quite Rockefeller money. And Harper\u2019s going to get way bigger offers than Hosmer did, obviously.\n\nThere might be something that tempts Harper and his agent about signing the biggest contract in major American professional sports history, which is certainly within the realm of possibilities even in a diminished market. But if he and Boras believe that the union will be able to negotiate a better deal in 2021 than the one it worked out in 2016, it\u2019s easy to see how he might be better served pursuing a three-year deal, or at least a front-loaded long-term contract with a 2021 opt-out.\n\nNo one but Harper can say his exact priorities in free agency \u2014 for all we know, he loves Prince\u2019s music so much that he wants nothing more than the opportunity to visit Paisley Park on the regular and will gladly sign at a huge discount with the Minnesota Twins. But if we\u2019re guessing that his goals are to make a metric butt-ton of money and win a ring, pursuing a short-term deal with a high annual salary \u2014 think three years, $125 million \u2014 would still ensure his great grandchildren are rich people while allowing him to choose a club he can feel confident will compete over the next three seasons. Then he\u2019d hit free agency again at age 29, potentially with a new CBA in place that gives the sport\u2019s big-market clubs no good excuse for bowing out of the sweepstakes.", "", "Build-a-Bear's 2 Black Friday 2018 deals means scoring multiple plush toys for just $6\n\nBuild-a-Bear Workshop announced its 2018 Black Friday deals.

He took advantage of the Hawks\u2019 ball watching and slammed home a go-ahead dunk off a putback.\n\nLeBron\u2019s heroics helped the Lakers win \u2014 as did Tyson Chandler\u2019s clutch block of Trae Young \u2014 but there\u2019s definitely a case to be made that LeBron deserved a technical on the play.\n\nFollowing the dunk, LeBron remained hanging on the rim for 9.13 seconds (as timed by stopwatch), which was blatant to say the least.\n\nVia NBA rules:\n\nAn offensive player who deliberately hangs on his basket ring, net, backboard or support during the game shall be assessed a non-unsportsmanlike technical foul.\n\nNow, the Hawks eventually called a timeout following the dunk, so that may have been why LeBron wasn\u2019t called for the technical. Still, he was already hanging on the rim for several seconds by the time Atlanta called timeout.

As suspected, the Hawks\u2019 timeout was the difference. Via the L2M report:", "LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 Wyoming's offense has undergone a transformation with Sean Chambers at the controls.\n\nSince the true freshman took over at quarterback 10 quarters ago, the unit has scored eight touchdowns. The Cowboys have put up 24.6 points (six more than their season average) and 404.3 yards a game (86 more than their season average), including season-highs in both categories during a two-game winning streak that still has Wyoming clinging to hope of a third straight bowl game.\n\nWyoming is sustaining drives better than it has all season by largely staying ahead of the chains on the legs of Chambers and Nico Evans, who've each rushed for more than 100 yards in the last three games. It's opened things up on the rare occasions the Cowboys throw the ball with Chambers completing 61 percent of his passes.\n\nTyler Vander Waal has had a front-row seat to it all.\n\nIt's a voluntary position taken by Vander Waal, whom Chambers replaced in the second half of the Cowboys' 24-16 setback to Utah State \u2014 their fourth straight loss at the time. It would've been easy to check out mentally after losing his starting job, but Vander Waal said not supporting his successor would've been both selfish and hypocritical of him.\n\n\"(Chambers) was supportive of me,\" Vander Waal told the Casper Star-Tribune. \"And I think all the quarterbacks are really supportive of each other. I think it speaks a lot to just how close the quarterbacks are. I don't care who's playing. I don't think we care who's playing. As long as we're having success and getting the job done and winning games, that's all that matters.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean it's always been easy for Vander Waal and his competitive nature to watch from the sideline, but he understands why head coach Craig Bohl benched him eight games into the season.\n\nEven with the threat of Evans, the nation's second-leading rusher, Wyoming's offense rarely found balance with Vander Waal under center. The Cowboys ranked last in the Mountain West in yards, points and passing yards through their first seven games and were converting on third down less than 30 percent of the time \u2014 the worst clip in the FBS.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason,\" Vander Waal said. \"I look at it as it's what's best for the team. It wasn't all about me. I wasn't getting the job done, so we put the next guy up. Sean's getting the job done.\"\n\nVander Waal completed just 50.2 percent of his passes in the first eight games, tossing more interceptions (4) than touchdowns (3). He was sacked 20 times, a combination of a young offensive line struggling to protect him and him admitting he held the ball longer than he should've at times.\n\nWith the offense going 10 straight quarters without a touchdown heading into the second half against Utah State, it became as much of a mental hurdle for Vander Waal as anything physical. Chambers came on for good after Vander Waal threw an ill-advised interception with Wyoming backed up inside its own 10-yard line on the first play of the third quarter.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing for me is just confidence,\" Vander Waal said. \"I kind of lacked confidence. I'd get in my head a little too much. I'd miss a throw and I'd get down on myself, and that would affect the next three or four throws.\"\n\nBut Vander Waal has stayed engaged, taking all the mental reps he can now that he's the backup while offering support along the way. Amid the team's celebration at Canvas Stadium following Wyoming's third straight Border War win over Colorado State on Oct. 26, Vander Waal found Chambers in the corner of the South end zone and congratulated him on his three-touchdown night as part of the Cowboys' 34-21 victory.\n\n\"I wouldn't necessarily say a cheerleader for Sean because Sean doesn't necessarily need a cheerleader, but he's been a really good teammate,\" Bohl said. \"I think that's an indication of our football team. There's not guys out there that have a selfish agenda. We appreciate Tyler, and there may come a time when his services are needed. He's prepared for that.\"\n\nVander Waal is staying ready knowing he's one play away from being back under center, but he's also got a future to think about should Chambers finish the season as the starter. With both of them being freshmen, would Vander Waal look for more consistent playing time somewhere else?\n\nRight now, Vander Waal said that's not the plan.\n\n\"I'm fully bought in,\" he said. \"I don't really care who's playing as long as we're winning games.\"\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)

(Don\u2019t answer that, I\u2019m making a point.) Much better to jump into a new series \u2013 the way another megastar novelist, David Baldacci, does in \u201cLong Road to Mercy.\u201d\n\nBut as befits these two slingers of suspense, it doesn\u2019t quite work out as you\u2019d expect.

In his new novel he does start off with a strong lead and an unforgettable backstory.\n\nAuthor Lee Child. (Photo: Axel Dupeux)\n\nWhen she was 6, Atlee Pine watched as a man came into her bedroom and took her sister, Mercy. As the book begins, Pine has found sanctuary in the FBI \u2013 she\u2019s a tough agent, preferring to work as far from others as possible, her current beat a remote office close to the Grand Canyon \u2013 and is taking to the road to visit the death-row prisoner she suspects of having kidnapped her sister.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s only a tease from Baldacci, to be pursued in other books. Almost immediately, Pine returns to a less personal case; deep in the canyon, a stolen mule has been found dead, and its rider wasn\u2019t just another tourist. Soon Pine is running rogue, plucky secretary in tow, unsure whether they can trust even the FBI itself, with Russia and North Korea (both!) on their tails.\n\n\u201cLong Road to Mercy\u201d is all over the place, overstuffed, brief when it needs more explanation and expansive when it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s hard not to laugh near the end of the book when a character asks Pine: \u201cSo, how did thing turns out with the nukes and stuff?\u201d It\u2019s about the level of interest the author shows in his own improbable plotline.\n\nCompare that to the sleek minimalism of Child\u2019s tale. In \u201cPast Tense,\u201d Reacher is in Maine, planning his long trek south for the winter, fueled as usual by superhuman amounts of coffee. But a road sign catches his eye. It\u2019s for Laconia, New Hampshire, the town his father came from. He hesitates \u2013 he was looking forward to warm weather \u2013 before deciding to stop for a day and poke around.\n\n\"Long Road to Mercy\" by David Baldacci (Photo: Grand Central)\n\nReacher is not a subtle poker. He immediately senses something off in Laconia, first in a strange hotel he passes, then in the lack of records about his family. What ensues is a pair of entwined stories, handled with adroit calm by Child, each of which lets Reacher use his unique skills as a brilliant former military cop to investigate them: Sherlock Holmes set to ultraviolent mode.\n\nChild has his own flaws. There\u2019s often a distracting sameness to the logic-driven interior lives of his characters, and Reacher\u2019s incursion into that odd Laconia hotel directly recycles much of the dark web material of Child\u2019s superb \u201cMake Me\u201d from 2015, a series highlight.\n\nBut the concision, procedural chops and terse, surprising action of \u201cPast Tense\u201d make it a fantastic read. What does it have that Baldacci\u2019s book doesn\u2019t? The answer is boring: Child\u2019s just better.\n\nThey used to say that Bear Bryant could beat you with his players, then turn around and beat you with yours.

(Adam Davy/PA via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The opening matches at the ATP Finals led to a debate over whether conditions at the O2 Arena were trickier than in past years.\n\nNovak Djokovic ended it.\n\nThe Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion made an impressive start to his campaign for a sixth title by dismissing John Isner 6-4, 6-3 on Monday.\n\nRoger Federer, who lost on Sunday, and Alexander Zverev described conditions as challenging following their error-strewn opening matches at the season-ending tournament, but Djokovic dropped just six points on his serve and made six unforced errors.\n\n\"My results here have been pretty good in the last 10 years, so I can't complain too much,\" said Djokovic, who has won four titles at the London venue. \"It takes a little bit of time really to get yourself adjusted to the surface because the surface is a good surface.\"\n\nA day after a ceremony to mark ending the season as No. 1, Djokovic underlined his status by nullifying Isner's usually destructive serve.\n\nIsner, who at 33 became the season-ending tournament's oldest debutant since 1972, applied himself admirably but barely avoided being broken more than once in the first set, and was broken twice more in the second set.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" Isner said of the atmosphere. \"I wish I could have given them a bit more to cheer for.\"\n\nThe one break Djokovic converted in the first set, at 2-2, was a cross-court forehand return winner which stranded Isner.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was in attendance, with Djokovic perhaps spurred on even more by the Juventus forward's presence.\n\n\"It's great to have big football star, sports star like him, courtside watching tennis,\" Djokovic said.\n\nAt 3-3, 15-30 in the second set, Isner sent down a second serve at 126 mph (203 kph). Djokovic sent it straight back at his feet and a shocked Isner hit his backhand long to concede two more break points.\n\nA forehand error from Isner confirmed the break, and the end of the contest. The merciless Djokovic held serve before breaking Isner once more with an inch-perfect backhand passing shot on match point.\n\n\"That was pretty comprehensive out there,\" Isner conceded.\n\nEarlier, Zverev came from a break down in both sets to defeat Marin Cilic 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1).\n\nFacing each other in their opening match for a second straight year, Zverev produced the slightly steadier tennis in an attritional contest to extend his record against Cilic to 2-0 at the O2 Arena and 6-1 overall.\n\nCilic, who made 46 unforced errors, dropped to 1-9 across his four appearances at the tournament.\n\n\"The win, that's the most important thing,\" said Zverev, who failed to advance from the round-robin stage on his debut last year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

These are some of the incidents that Deon \"Strawberry\" Hampton, who was born male but has identified as female since the age of 5, says she has had to endure over the past two years at four male prisons throughout the state.\n\nThe alleged abuse has caused her to sue the Illinois Department of Corrections multiple times for transfer to a female prison, and each time, the request has been denied. She is preyed upon, she says, by both prison guards and inmates. She has also been denied the opportunity to go to a transgender support group, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\n\nAfter her latest suit, a judge Wednesday went further than any other: Hampton must be allowed access to group therapy and guards and staff must get training on dealing with transgender inmates. The judge, Nancy Rosenstengel, gave DOC, two weeks to come up with a training plan. As for Hampton's request for a transfer? Still not granted. Rosenstengel has called for its reconsideration.\n\nBut a report out of Minnesota has many wondering whether the guards in America's prisons are in more danger than prisoners at the hands of inmates. The number of staff who have been victims of assaults in that state's prisons has steadily climbed since 2014, with this year's assaults on pace to beat last year's high.\n\nThis year alone, a guard was beaten to death with a hammer. Another died after trying to help a fellow officer who was being attacked by an inmate. So far this year, there have been 51 incidents on the part of inmates that have been violent enough for prosecution. And nearly 60 inmates have been convicted in 2018 for incidents involving staff.\n\nKicking a teenager deemed 'reasonable'\n\nThe 17-year-old had already been pepper sprayed and was bending over to protect his eyes when Officer Ian Cole kicked him, sending him careening toward the asphalt. But after a review of the cop's actions, which were caught on video and went viral, a board for the Yakima Police Department in Washington State determined that Cole responded reasonably.\n\nThe Sept. 23 incident started at fair grounds in central Washington with a fight involving 15 people. The teen's lawyer said the child was simply trying to protect himself from others who were beating him up. Several people were arrested after the incident.\n\nThe Use of Force Review Board, which includes two officers from Yakima law enforcement, reviewed the social media video and the department's policy before concluding that Cole should not be disciplined.\n\nMembers of police departments investigating actions of misconduct among their own ranks is nothing new. And plenty of activists and attorneys, including the one for the teenager in this case, question the practice's fairness.\n\nThe review board examining this case also included officers from other area police departments and the chair of a college criminal justice department.\n\nWant more?

Rowling's \"Fantastic Beasts\" series.\n\n\u201cShe was toddling at the time, just running around causing complete havoc,\" says Redmayne, noting his whole family got in \"fancy dress\" as characters from \"Fantastic Beasts\" that night. \"When I read the second script in which there are baby Nifflers ... it was like I was method acting. I felt like I knew how to handle the baby Nifflers!\"\n\n\u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d (in theaters Friday) picks up in 1926, just weeks after the first film, as the fearsome, deceptively magnetic Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) breaks out of his New York prison and crosses the Atlantic to raise a dark resistance of true-blood wizards in Europe.\n\nNewt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) encounters a mischievous baby Niffler in \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\nThe sequel also finds classic introvert and magizoologist Newt Scamander (Redmayne) grappling with newfound fame inside the wizarding world as his former instructor, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law), tries to enlist his help in neutralizing Grindelwald. And when not caring for his case full of bellicose creatures, Newt is flummoxed to find himself quite awkwardly in love with criminal-chasing Auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston).\n\n\u201cWhat (Rowling) manages to do is to tell stories that feel completely contemporary yet also expose the fact that history repeats itself. She seems to shine a light on that \u2026while also creating escapism,\u201d says Redmayne, sinking back into a couch inside West Hollywood's Palihouse hotel.\n\nCLOSE The trailer for \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" is here.\n\nIn real life, the Oscar winner is now a father of two (son Luke was born in March) with wife Hannah Bagshawe. Redmayne seems to have found a new rhythm, filming a \"Fantastic\" film roughly every two years while fitting in an occasional passion project.\n\nIn fact, Redmayne just wrapped \u201cThe Aeronauts\u201d with his \"Theory of Everything\" co-star Felicity Jones \u2013 \u201cwell, almost finished the film,\u201d he says ruefully, glancing down at his ankle, which is encased in a brace. \u201cBecause on the penultimate day, I walked on a crash mat, tripped and ruptured the tendons in my foot.\u201d\n\nStill, he\u2019s \u201cincredibly happy\u201d these days. Actors often lead nomadic lives, jumping from set to set around the world. Frankly, \"that\u2019s not how I would like to live my life,\u201d says Redmayne. \u201cI\u2019m quite an ordered, methodical person.\u201d \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d has afforded chunks of time his brood can live at home (the franchise shoots outside of London, where Redmayne is based).\n\nEddie Redmayne and his wife Hannah Bagshawe arrive for the Nov. 8 premiere of \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" in Paris.

Upon completion of \"The Aeronauts,\" he's circling an upcoming Aaron Sorkin project, \"The Trial of the Chicago 7.\"\n\nHis chief goal with work, he says, is to travel as a foursome. \"I\u2019m happy to give everything to (a project), but I need to make sure that they will bring my family,\" he says.\n\nAnd given these often dark, Muggle times we live in, the actor says he's pulled toward making films that inspire the imagination. \"We\u2019re all looking down in the world and everything is insulated,\" he says. \"It\u2019s about the wonder and encouraging people to keep looking up and aspiring.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/12/eddie-redmayne-fantastic-beasts-spraining-his-ankle-fatherhood/1969514002/", "The New England Patriots lost to the Tennessee Titans, 34-10, on Monday. The Patriots dropped to 7-3, and fell to fourth in the AFC behind the top-ranked Kansas City Chiefs, second-ranked Los Angeles Chargers and third-ranked Pittsburgh Steelers, all of whom won in Week 10.\n\nHere\u2019s why that matters.\n\nBig picture\n\nThe Patriots put forth their most discouraging effort of the season. It wasn\u2019t just that it was a blowout against a 4-4 team. It\u2019s that the blowout came in Week 10 \u2014 and not early in the season. When New England loses by a considerable margin in the beginning of the season, there\u2019s the sense that they have room to grow. However, the Patriots should be showing that growth at this point in the season. Instead, they\u2019ve shown a great deal of inconsistency, particularly in road games, which is problematic because they\u2019re slipping down the playoff standings and are losing home field advantage.\n\nThere\u2019s some good news. The Patriots have four upcoming games against AFC East opponents, who are struggling this season. And while a matchup against the Steelers in Week 15 will be a challenge, the Patriots can use that game to potentially get a win in-hand over Pittsburgh in the playoff race.\n\nThis week\u2019s talking point\n\nThe Patriots should be grateful to have a bye week.\n\nTight end Rob Gronkowski and guard Shaq Mason missed their second game in a row in Week 10. Receiver Julian Edelman and tackles Marcus Cannon and Trent Brown all exited the game early against the Titans. Cannon returned. Running back Sony Michel has been recovering from a knee injury, and played limited snaps on Sunday after missing two weeks. Their offense is struggling enormously with injuries. A best case scenario for the Patriots is a quiet week where their star players get healthy.\n\nWe\u2019ll also discuss\n\nThe rest of the season should serve as a reminder of just how much better the Patriots are than the rest of the AFC East. So while the loss to Tennessee might be discouraging, the Patriots should have an easy finish to the season where they\u2019ll again finish as divisional champions.\n\nBut that\u2019s never enough in New England. The goal is a Super Bowl berth. And so with a lot of time to mull over the loss to the Titans, it\u2019ll be time to wonder whether these Patriots have the talent to be champions, especially if they have to go on the road to play the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium to get to the Super Bowl.", "", "Crowds gathered at Jetty Park at Port Canaveral Thursday evening to watch the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest cruise ship, Royal Caribbean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Symphony of the Seas leave Port Canaveral.

Measuring 228,081 gross tons, it's built on the same platform as Royal Caribbean's 2-year-old Harmony of the Seas, the previous size leader in cruising.

(Photo: WARNER BROS. TELEVISION)\n\nThere comes a time in the life of every major TV show when writers must give thanks for their show's longevity and write a Thanksgiving episode.\n\nThe Thanksgiving TV episode is a distinctly American TV tradition for a distinctly American holiday. It\u2019s not to be confused with a holiday special like \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.\" We\u2019re talking about your favorite TV characters sitting down (we hope) for a delicious turkey dinner together and comedy and/or drama ensuing, as it did most memorably on \"Friends.\"\n\nWho can forget Monica (Courteney Cox) dancing with a turkey on her head? Who thought turkeys could fly in \u201cWKRP in Cincinnati\u201d? How many bet on the outcome of \u201cSlapsgiving\u201d on \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d?\n\nTV series tackle major holidays all the time, from Thanksgiving and Christmas to Halloween and Valentine's Day. And while many holidays can produce great stories, there\u2019s something about giving thanks that creates the best television. Sorry, Santa.\n\nThe genius of the Thanksgiving episode is that the writers are forced to focus on the characters rather than decking the halls or silly costumes. Sure, sometimes there are turkey and parade antics and maybe a round of touch football, but the essence of the holiday \u2013 and thus these episodes \u2013 is a family of relatives, friends or even co-workers gathering around a table to share a meal. The turkey may burn, but the drama and comedy comes from Denise (Lena Waithe) finally coming out to her mother (Angela Bassett) on \"Master of None\" or Randall\u2019s (Sterling K. Brown) obsession with tradition on \u201cThis Is Us\u201d or Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Lorelai\u2019s (Lauren Graham) self-destructive desire to please their friends and family on \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d\n\nMarshall (Jason Segel) sings \u201cYou Just Got Slapped\u201d in the \u201cSlapsgiving\u201d episode of \u201cHow I Met Your Mother.\u201d (Photo: CBS)\n\nFamily is an instantly relatable theme: When yours gets together, there probably is some tension, just like with your favorite TV family. That\u2019s the repeated story in the yearly outings of ABC's \u201cThe Goldbergs,\u201d in which Murray (Jeff Garlin) always argues with his brother Marvin (Dan Fogler). It might get old, but when it comes to family problems, the same fight is likely to break out again and again.\n\nFogler is just one of the many great guest stars who have popped in for a Turkey Day treat. Brad Pitt showed up on \u201cFriends\u201d as a man who hated Rachel (Jennifer Aniston, then his wife). Jamie Lee Curtis and Rob Reiner appeared as Jess\u2019 (Zoey Deschanel) divorced parents on \u201cNew Girl.\u201d\n\nAs great as they can be, Christmas episodes don\u2019t have the same spark. Sure, you can get great guest stars and heated family dynamics in those episodes, but they're often weighed down with a schmaltzy tone straight out of a Hallmark movie or \"Jingle All the Way\"-style gift and decoration antics.\n\nAny conflict is resolved in holiday celebrations (Chrismukkah on \u201cThe O.C.\u201d). Christmas magic is maybe real (\u201cCommunity\u201d). Someone helps the less fortunate (\u201cThe West Wing\u201d). Everyone is nicer and sweeter on this one day of the year. Even supernatural shows like \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d fall prey to the cliched \u201cmagic of Christmas.\u201d \"Who\" has a cheery Christmas special every year, and \"Buffy\" aired an episode in which a Christmas snowfall saves Angel (David Boreanaz) from killing himself.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for that bountiful Christmas spirit, dozens of TV movies about happily-ever-afters can be found on an expanding number of outlets (Netflix, BET, Freeform and Lifetime have stepped into Hallmark\u2019s territory), plus specials like \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas\u201d and \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\u201d Can you name a Thanksgiving TV special other than \u201cCharlie Brown\u201d?\n\nRory (Alexis Bledel\u201d and Lorelai (Lauren Graham) try to attend four Thanksgiving dinners on the \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d episode, \u201cA Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving.\u201d (Photo: WB)\n\nAnd as fun as it is to see favorite characters in Halloween costumes, dating on Valentine\u2019s Day or toasting at midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve, all those holidays are slighter than Thanksgiving, and so are the episodes that accompany them.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about Thanksgiving: Regardless of your religion or race, all Americans celebrate it, and there are a million ways to do so. So we get strippers and ecstasy on \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d or a pumpkin fight on \u201cModern Family\u201d or the precinct getting stuck in lockdown on \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more TV than ever, and thus more Thanksgiving TV than ever. You can break bread with the DiMeos on ABC's \u201cSpeechless\u201d (Friday, 8:30 EST/PST) or toast with the Pearsons on NBC's \u201cThis is Us\u201d (Nov. 20, 9 EST/PST).\n\nAnd that\u2019s certainly something to be thankful for.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/12/why-thanksgiving-tv-episode-best-kind-holiday-special/1942673002/", "Even though they came away with a win on Sunday, the Los Angeles Rams played their sloppiest game of the season \u2013 and they didn\u2019t commit a single turnover. It was sloppy in a different sense, committing unnecessary penalties left and right.\n\nThey were flagged 10 times for 102 yards, nearly costing themselves a win with personal fouls, roughing the passer penalties and post-whistle altercations. The Rams are typically a disciplined team and rarely commit stupid penalties, but that definitely wasn\u2019t the case against the Seahawks.\n\nSean McVay talked about those penalties after the win and it\u2019s safe to say he wasn\u2019t pleased. In fact, he was borderline furious. Yet, once again, he took the blame and put it on himself.\n\n\u201cNot pleased at all with the penalties, the self-inflicted wounds. It\u2019s not indicative of the type of football team that we want to be,\u201d McVay said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do a better job of making sure that our standards, our expectations, are much higher with regards to how we respond to some of the things that don\u2019t go our way or if some things are being done to try to entice a response from us.\u201d\n\nDante Fowler Jr. was flagged for a personal foul after discussing a play with an official, costing the Rams 15 yards and an automatic first down. Two plays later, the Seahawks scored a touchdown to take a 21-20 lead in the third quarter.\n\nThat was just one of many foolish infractions by Rams players as they were called for six personal fouls, one of which was offset by a flag on the Seahawks. They nearly cost themselves the game with drive-extending penalties, and McVay is just thankful to come away with a win.\n\n\u201cIt can definitely cost us. It could have cost us today and really frankly it probably should have. Those are the things that were upsetting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd again, I\u2019m as responsible as anybody with regards to making sure that I\u2019m demonstrating a consistent demeanor that is indicative of what we want in terms of how we handle a little bit of adversity. Where it truly is next play, next move on, don\u2019t allow a previous play to affect your ability to move forward and I didn\u2019t do that today. Then there were some instances where we didn\u2019t do that as a team and that\u2019s where I\u2019ve got to be better for everybody.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s a part of his nature as a coach to take the blame, McVay can\u2019t control the responses that players have to certain situations. He\u2019s really bothered by the way some players retaliated and expressed their frustration, which has to be fixed next week against the Chiefs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more interested in how we handle some of the things that take place throughout the course of the game and our ability to control our responses that don\u2019t lead to beating yourself. Those are the things that good teams don\u2019t do,\u201d McVay added. \u201cFortunately, we got away with it today and we can learn without having to learn truly the hard way. But, that\u2019s just the reality, just being honest about it. And it bothers me. It really does.\u201d", "CLOSE Dubai's police force have added hoverbikes to their fleet, which already includes electronic vehicles and high-end sports cars.

Hoversurf has gotten approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for the vehicle.\n\nThe vehicles, which weigh 253 pounds, fly about 16 feet above the ground and can go 60 miles per hour. They achieve flight with electric ducted fans and propellers. The lithium manganese nickel battery allows the hoverbike to fly 10 to 25 minutes with a pilot.

Jon's going nowhere. That's just the way it is.\"\n\nDavis went out of his way to defend Carr, explaining that the quarterback's primary targets at the moment \u2014 wide receivers Jordy Nelson and Seth Roberts \u2014 are \"good guys, but they're not putting the fear of God in anybody.\" He also stood by the team's handling of the Khalil Mack situation, claiming that Mack's contract demands were unrealistic for a team with \"all the holes that we had.\"\n\n\"Everybody thinks that Jon's the one who wanted to get rid of him,\" Davis told ESPN. \"Jon wanted him badly. Why wouldn't you want this guy? Reggie wanted him badly.

For people 40 and older without heart disease, doctors should discuss taking statins \u2013 drugs which help control cholesterol levels \u2013 based on their risk.\n\n\"The truth about clinical medicine is there is no black and white. It's all gray,\" said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a writing committee member and chair of the department of preventive medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, in a statement.\n\n\"That's why the emphasis in this document is making sure the patient and doctor are having well-informed discussions about the benefits and the potential risks of drug therapy.\"\n\nAccording to the AHA, the optimal level of LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol, is less than 100 mg/dL.\n\nThe last time the AHA and American College of Cardiology updated their guidelines was 2013, which made twice as many Americans eligible to take statins. A week after those guidelines were published, two Harvard Medical School professors questioned whether formulas used to determine high cholesterol might overestimate people's risk.\n\nDr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at The Cleveland Clinic and critic of the 2013 guidelines said the latest revisions represent a \"great improvement\" over the guidelines issued five years ago.\n\nNissen said the key additions include thresholds for treating patients with high cholesterol, and better guidance for treating people over 75 years old and under 40.\n\n\"It\u2019s much more in line with what a lot of us think should have been done in 2013,\" he said.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/12/new-cholesterol-guidelines-suggest-lifespan-approach-treatment/1974753002/", "", "CLOSE The United States and Iran have been lobbing threats, fighting proxy wars, and imposing sanctions for decades.

The U.S. Airways hero pilot of flight 1549 who against the odds and while the whole world was watching safely landed in the Hudson River in 2009 after his plane collided with birds, causing both engines to fail?\n\nWell, Shahbazi is Iran's Sullenberger.\n\nBut while Shahbazi's flying skills are rightly celebrated, even heroes know their limits.\n\nIran\u2019s isolation from the world has left it with one of the oldest civil-aviation fleets in the world and facilitated a fatal trend in its aviation-safety record that experts say is likely to continue amid President Donald Trump\u2019s renewal of economic sanctions on Tehran.\n\nWestern manufacturers, under the sanctions, are strictly prohibited from selling planes and even crucial spare parts to Iran. The sanctions started again in August and were re-imposed in full on Nov. 5. with a new clampdown on Iran\u2019s central banks and the nation\u2019s ability to export oil, a vital industry, after Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nMore: Exclusive: Iran open to talks with US if Trump changes \u2018approach\u2019 to nuclear deal, top diplomat says\n\nMore: INSIDE IRAN: America\u2019s contentious history in Iran leads to mix of anger, wonderment and weariness\n\nMore: USA TODAY journalist gets rare glimpse of life in Iran\n\nThis worries Shahbazi, 62, who said he was forced into early retirement by Iranian authorities for repeatedly portraying Iran\u2019s commercial airlines as unsafe.\n\n\"We are flying planes with 60-year-old technology and these planes are technically worn out,\" he said. \"U.S. sanctions have led to many crashes, and deaths.\"\n\n\u201cTreasury\u2019s imposition of unprecedented financial pressure on Iran should make clear to the Iranian regime that they will face mounting financial isolation and economic stagnation until they fundamentally change their destabilizing behavior,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement last week as the U.S. government sanctioned 50 Iranian banks and several hundred individuals and vessels in Iran\u2019s energy and shipping sector as well as an Iranian airline and its 65 aircraft.\n\nAccording to Air Fleets, an aviation website, the average age of an Iranian commercial plane is 20.8 years. But many are closer to 30. One plane, a Boeing 747 flown by Caspian Airlines, which operates routes between Tehran and Middle Eastern hubs, is nearly 45. The average age of aircraft operated by major U.S. airlines is about 11 years.\n\nWhile the United States and Russia account for the highest total number of fatal civilian airliner accidents from 1945 until the present day \u2014 830 and 520, respectively, with a combined death toll of 19,136, according to the Aviation Safety Network, an industry database \u2014 decades of international sanctions have starved Iran of equipment and expertise and also contributed to an unusually high passenger death rate.\n\nIranian pilot Houshang Shahbazi. (Photo: Houshang Shahbazi)\n\nIn fact, Iran's 20-year average is 1.89 deaths per 1 million passenger journeys, according to an analysis by Iran-focused website Bourse & Bazaar. The average over the same period for the rest of the world is 0.34 deaths per 1 million passenger journeys. By this measure, flying in Iran is 5.5 times more deadly than the world average.\n\nWhen the nuclear deal was signed under former President Barack Obama, Iran quickly inked agreements with major aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus. By the time Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal two years later, Boeing had not delivered any of its aircraft to Iran. Airbus delivered three out of 98 ordered.\n\n\"It's not commonly discussed but when Iranian flights take off they fly mechanics with them in case anything goes wrong,\" said Addison Schonland, a partner at airline consulting firm AirInsight Group. \"However, because the data aren't that great it's hard to determine how directly the sanctions are responsible for Iran's crash record, but there's no doubt that they are a contributing factor,\" he added.\n\nSchonland noted that while older planes are not inherently unsafe, they \"are like older people, they need more health care. So parts are critical to acquire.\"\n\nThe \"sad state\" of Iran's aviation industry is pretty clear, said Trita Parsi, the founder of the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, which advocates for greater understanding between the Iranian and American people.\n\n\"In Iran, people routinely talk about which airlines to avoid,\" he said.\n\nOf the five major fatal planes crashes in 2018, one has been in Iran. Sixty-six people were killed in February after an Aseman Airlines plane crashed an hour outside Tehran.\n\nOne of those who died was Majid Eslami, 40, the plane's flight engineer.\n\nHis wife, Fatemeh, 37, blames the Trump administration for his death and described the U.S. sanctions on Iran's aviation industry as her husband's ultimate \"murderer.\"\n\nYet for Washington, the Iranians have only themselves to blame.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused Iran of spending billions of dollars across the Middle East to gain influence, support terrorism and destabilize governments.\n\nThe State Department wants countries around the world to cut purchases from Iran's lucrative oil industry to zero to pressure Iran's economy and limit its ability to fund its nuclear weapons program, although it gave sanctions waivers to eight large customers of Iranian oil such as South Korea and India. Tehran may also continue to sell oil to China, Russia and other nations through back-door channels. Oil analysts believe Iran will likely be able to sell about one million barrels of oil a day, about half of what it was selling last year, but enough to allow its economy to tread water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete fantasy to think that Iran\u2019s oil exports will be brought down to zero,\u201d one senior Iranian diplomat based in Europe told USA TODAY.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has repeatedly certified that Iran is fully complying with the terms of the nuclear accord by freezing parts of its nuclear enrichment program. And human rights organizations say the sanctions are preventing Iranians from accessing essential medicine and food despite Washington's insistence the sanction's don't target these.\n\nStill, Pompeo says that the Trump administration's \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran \u2014 exiting the nuclear accord, reimposing sanctions \u2014 is designed to choke off funds that Iran's regime is using to fuel violence and destructive activity in Afghanistan, Gaza, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\"Instead of using what wealth the (nuclear deal) has generated to boost the material well-being of the Iranian people, the regime has parasitically consumed it and shelled out billions in subsidies for dictators, terrorists and rogue militias,\" Pompeo wrote in an essay for the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. \"Iranians are understandably frustrated. The rial\u2019s value has collapsed in the past year. A third of Iranian youth are unemployed. Unpaid wages are leading to rampant strikes.\"\n\nPompeo has also accused Iran of assassination attempts against dissidents in Finland and France and backed an allegation from Danish security services that Tehran was plotting an assault in the Scandinavian nation. Iran says it has not seen the evidence. It also points out that Denmark received its intelligence about the alleged plot from Israel, a longstanding enemy of Iran that strongly opposes the nuclear deal.\n\n\"Foreign adventurism is holding Iran back, there's no question about that,\" said Nicholas Hopton, who until this past April was Britain's Ambassador to Iran.\n\n\"But sanctions work when they're coupled with engagement,\" he added.\n\nAnd for the time being, whatever engagement Iran is getting is not from Washington, but Europe, where governments and policymakers have scrambled to devise a way of keeping the nuclear deal alive by sidestepping Washington and ensuring that economic ties and banking connections to Iran remain in place despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nOne idea from the Europeans is a \"special purpose vehicle\" that would enable trade with Iran to continue through a Europe-based financial intermediary. It would use euros rather than dollars and wouldn't permit U.S. authorities to scrutinize Iran's transactions.\n\n\"The United States is exercising its economic power beyond the normal acceptable limits,\" Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview. \"The special purpose vehicle is one measure specifically designed as the first step to deal with Iran\u2019s situation, but it's ultimate objective, as we've heard from the Europeans, is not simply to insulate trade between Iran and Europe, or between Iran and its third-party partners, but in fact (for Europe) to insulate themselves from the pressure it faces from the United States,\" he added.\n\nBruno Le Maire, France's economy minister, told the Financial Times in an interview that \"Europe refuses to allow the U.S. to be the trade policeman of the world.\" He said that the goal of the financial channel being opened to Iran was part of a broader push to ensure Europe maintains its \"economic sovereignty\" from Washington.\n\nCLOSE In an interview with USA TODAY, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif talked about U.S.-Iran relations and the Iran nuclear deal Neale Haynes and Jasper Colt, USA TODAY\n\nHowever, the idea risks drawing the Trump administration's wrath.\n\n\"Iran\u2019s been a much different country\" after he withdrew the U.S. \"from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal,\" Trump said at a midterm elections campaign rally Sunday in Georgia. \"When I came in it was just a question of how long would it take them to take over the whole Middle East,\" he added.\n\nAnd last month, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said: \"We do not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anybody else.\"\n\nEurope's efforts won't immediately help Iran's flyers, either.\n\nShahbazi, Iran's hero pilot, said he knows scores of frequent travelers in Iran who do everything in their power to avoid stepping onto one of Iran's commercial aircraft.\n\n\"Everybody knows the risks Iranians face in the air,\" he said. \"And everybody's scared.\"\n\nIn July, USA TODAY reporter Kim Hjelmgaard was given rare access to travel to Iran.

The idea is that, instead of holding your phone up to your face for a jerky visual conversation with grandma and grandpa, you get a beautiful mini-TV, with a 10-inch screen, from which \u2014 in a perfect world \u2014 would involve the entire family for a group chat.\n\nThe installed camera is the breakthrough: It moves with you and the sounds of other voices to automatically scan the room for all the participants.\n\nThe result is video chat that suddenly looks professional, with a camera that zooms in instead of giving you one steady, boring image.\n\nMore: Facebook says, yes, Portal does track your calls, but it really isn't for snooping\n\nMore: Hey Portal, Facebook might want to cut the losses now on the video device\n\nMore: Facebook, FAO Schwarz and Build-A-Bear pop up with temporary shops this holiday season\n\nThe downside is that the device comes from Facebook, the company that\u2019s been hindered by two years of public relations nightmares. A rogue app developer took our personal information and sold it in 2016; just two months ago, Facebook admitted that some 30 million members were hacked, and had their personal information revealed.\n\nFacebook insists it won\u2019t record our calls, which is good. But it does record us every time we say \u201cHey Portal,\u201d with a command and stores those recordings online. It monitors who we have called, where they live and how long we\u2019ve spoken, something it automatically does every time we make calls on the Facebook Messenger platform. It admits it could sell ads and show them to us elsewhere based on the information gleaned from Portal.\n\nSo if you\u2019re willing to live with that kind of exposure, and have family members you\u2019d like to stay in contact with more often, then Portal could be the device that really pushes video chat to the mainstream. It\u2019s that good.\n\nNote that this is coming from the person who wrote just a few weeks ago that the Portal was doomed to failure, due to Facebook\u2019s endless privacy issues, and suggested the social network pull it before it even launched.\n\nSo Facebook surprised me with a really nice device. That said, the rest of the features beyond chat and the digital photo frame leave a lot to be desired. Compared to the $229 Amazon Echo Show or $149 Google Home Hub, similar products that allow voice command of things like listening to music or watching videos, Portal (which starts at $199) is stuck in the dark ages.\n\nOn Portal, your voice can only open an app or initiate a phone/video chat. Huge fail in that regard.\n\nThe Portal is available from Facebook\u2019s online store, Amazon and Best Buy.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/12/facebook-portal-video-chat-device-skype-facetime/1973978002/", "bad url", "Gladbach's Alassane Plea celebrates after scoring his side's opening goal during the German Bundesliga soccer match between Werder Bremen and Borussia Moenchengladbach in Bremen, German, saturdasy, Nov.10, 2018.

As \u201cCrimes\u201d opens, Tina has a little more spring in her step because she's got her old job back and a Newt-influenced rebellious streak, but there\u2019s a romantic entanglement involving him and old crush Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz). \u201cRight when (Rowling) gets her on more solid ground professionally, she makes her love life rockier,\u201d Waterston says.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore (Jude Law) conjures some magic for his Hogwarts students in \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\nHow is younger Dumbledore different from the old one?\n\nNewt\u2019s former teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry reaches out to him to find isolated young wizard Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) before Grindelwald does. Years earlier, Dumbledore and Grindelwald were \u201ccloser than brothers,\u201d but Dumbledore isn't fully healed from the trauma of their personal rift, Law says. While the \u201cPotter\u201d books refer to Dumbledore seeing the good in everyone, the relationship with Grindelwald \u201cleft a scar,\u201d Law adds. \u201cHe has a sense that he can turn (Grindelwald) around and win, but he also recognizes the danger and threat.\u201d\n\nDark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) addresses his fellow magical types in \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\" (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\nDoes Depp steal the movie?\n\nA year ago, Rowling and director David Yates stood by the actor amid a casting backlash after Depp\u2019s ex-wife Amber Heard said he physically abused her (Depp says he was \"falsely accused\"). But Depp\u2019s castmates were impressed by what he brought to Grindelwald. \u201cHe manages to cast a spell,\u201d Law says. \u201c(While) being threatening, he's also seductive.\u201d Miller appreciated Depp\u2019s \u201cserving of early 20th-century Marilyn Manson looks and the glory of a very, very intricate, well-thought-out, committed performance.\u201d\n\nDumbledore (Jude Law) is haunted by visions of his old friend Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\nIs Grindelwald the Trump of this wizarding world?\n\nIt\u2019s a fair question, given the villain\u2019s ideology, his way of swaying people to his cause and his love for grandstanding. \u201cHere's the thing: Great writers seem to have this ability to pick up on stuff that's in the ether,\u201d says Law, though he believes Rowling wrote \u201cCrimes\u201d before the 2016 presidential election. \u201cShe (tapped) into something that she clearly felt was around, and here we are.\u201d\n\nMore: 'Fantastic Beasts' cast talks impeachment spells, Johnny Depp startles fans at Comic-Con\n\nPreview: 10 movies you must see this holiday season, from 'Fantastic Beasts' to 'Mary Poppins'\n\nThe Zouwu is large and in charge as one of the new \"Fantastic Beasts\" critters.

As Dumbledore, \u201cJude\u2019s got so much power, he doesn't need to be aggressive with his wand,\u201d Waterston says. \u201cNewt uses his in all of these inventive ways for tracking beasts and he uses it in ways nobody else would.\u201d For Tina, Waterston thought about how detectives move through a space and how cops draw their weapons: \u201cShe's very good with her wand, and she doesn't always have to muscle it to get it to do something impressive.\u201d\n\nThe new \"Fantastic Beasts\" film revisits the hallowed halls of Hogwarts from the \"Harry Potter\" films. (Photo: WARNER BROS.)\n\nHow awesome is it to film in Hogwarts?\n\nHarry Potter\u2019s future school plays a major role in key \u201cCrimes\u201d scenes, especially for Dumbledore. \u201cThey're beautiful sets to work on because they are incredibly detailed and wonderfully realistic,\u201d Law says. But \u201cyou can't be losing your head and running around taking selfies, especially when you're playing a professor who's running the class.\u201d Waterston recalls being \u201cquite jealous\u201d when other actors got to hang out there,\u201clike Zoe bragging about doing some scenes at Hogwarts and the rest of us were not having it.

Plenty.\n\nMost tips are the same from year to year: Arrive early. Brace for crowds. Pack smart. Regular travelers won\u2019t be surprised by that. But there are updates for 2018 that travelers should know about.\n\nIf you're taking to the skies this Thanksgiving, scroll down to see what's new and to brush up on the basics of holiday travel.\n\nCLOSE A new study by Adobe Analytics, smartphones are predicted to drive 35% of all purchases on Thanksgiving. Buzz60\n\nWhat\u2019s new?\n\nThe TSA is increasingly asking travelers to take food items out of their carry-on bags when they go through screening checkpoints. The reason: Food items add to the clutter agents see when they view X-ray images of passengers\u2019 luggage. Removing those items allows screeners to focus on other items and could help speed the process, TSA says.\n\nAnother new focus this year: Powders, including items like cosmetics, baby powder, protein powder mixes and ground coffee, among others. TSA wants flyers to check powder-like substances if they\u2019re in containers larger than 12 ounces (350 milliliters) \u2013 roughly the size of a can of soda. Smaller items can be brought in carry-on bags, but agents will likely ask for them to be pulled out so they can be screened separately.\n\nThe updated powder guidance isn't a ban. But the risk for a traveler with a large container in a carry-on bag is that he or she could be forced to throw away a \u201csuspicious\u201d substance before clearing the checkpoint. The main security concern is improvised explosives, but TSA told USA TODAY earlier this year that it is also worried about fentanyl or pepper spray being brought into cabins.\n\nMore: TSA: Fliers will face more scrutiny for powders in carry-on bags\n\nThe new food and powder guidelines follow an update from a year earlier when the agency began requiring flyers to remove all electronics larger than a cellphone from carry-on bags for screening. Flyers also now must place these items separately in bins to go through scanning.\n\nFlyers using Precheck lines will be exempt from some of the updated guidelines, but it\u2019s possible an agent still might ask for these items to be removed for screening.\n\nIN PICTURES: 40 cool photos: Planespotting, behind the scenes at Washington Dulles (story continues below)\n\nBusiest days\n\nAirports will see a steady rush throughout the holiday period, but Thanksgiving is notorious for two peak days: the Wednesday before and the Sunday after. But, for 2018, a third day \u2013 the Friday before Thanksgiving (Nov. 16) \u2013 will join the mix, according to TSA.\n\nHistorically, and unsurprisingly, the lightest day of the period will be Thanksgiving itself (Thursday, Nov. 22).\n\nStill, there will be variations at airports around the country. In San Francisco, for example, officials say the busiest Thanksgiving travel day will be the Friday prior (Nov. 16). In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the busiest post-Thanksgiving travel day is forecast to be Monday (Nov. 26), not Sunday.\n\nCLOSE It's the time of year where we all get to see our families and loved ones! Don't go ruining such a special moment! Here are a few things you need to steer clear of in order to have a seamless holiday season. Buzz60\n\nAllow extra time, expect busy terminals\n\nNo one wants to spend more time than necessary waiting in an airport terminal. However, this isn\u2019t the time of year to test how close you can cut it.\n\nAside from the possibility of busy terminals and long lines at check-in and security, expect heavier-than-usual traffic on entrance roadways, parking shuttles and public transportation. Inside the terminal, unusually heavy crowds may lead to backups at check-in counters and security lines.\n\nA good rule of thumb for Thanksgiving: Arrive at the airport 45 to 60 minutes earlier than you normally would. You\u2019ll be glad you did, especially if you find yourself stuck in a security line filled with slow-moving families making their once-a-year holiday trip. Remember: If you miss your flight, this is a tough time of the year to find empty seats on other flights.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Would you bid 420,000 miles to see a parked plane? These frequent-fliers did (story continues below)\n\nPack smart\n\nPack your carry-ons with security lines in mind. Unless you\u2019re eligible for the TSA\u2019s Precheck lines, laptops and liquids must come out separately to go through the screening checkpoints. The same thing goes for large electronics and food items. Remember, these items must each be placed in their own bins as you go through security.\n\nFor the infrequent flyers, remember that most liquids are prohibited from carry-ons unless they are in containers of 3.4 ounces or less and are held in a clear, quart-size plastic bag. (See the TSA\u2019s \u201c3-1-1\u201d rules on liquids). Some exceptions are made for liquids related to medical or childcare needs, but it may be smart to brush up on those rules.\n\nPack so that your laptops, liquids and other items can be quickly taken in and out of your luggage. That will not only speed up your trip through security, but will also shorten the wait for those behind you.\n\nIf you check a bag \u2013 either in advance or at the gate after your plane runs out of overhead bin space \u2013 remember to keep all of your important medicines and valuable items in your carry-on. If you\u2019re forced to check a bag at the last moment, remove valuables as well as fragile items that could be damaged.\n\nBe aware of potential travel trouble spots\n\nWatch the weather starting as early as 72 hours leading up to your flight. It may be sunny and warm where you are, but there could be problems between you and your destination. Snow, wind, rain and poor visibility are some of the most common weather problems for the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays.\n\nIf there\u2019s poor weather at home \u2013 or at your destination \u2013 monitor your airline\u2019s website for potential updates. In some cases, airlines will issue weather waivers that may allow you to move your flight at no cost to avoid weather-related disruptions.\n\nNearly every carrier\u2019s website now lets you check the status of your flight. On the day of your flight (or the evening before), keep tabs on your flight status. The sooner you know there\u2019s a cancellation or delay that could affect your travel, the sooner you\u2019ll be able to troubleshoot it with your airline or travel agent.\n\nCLOSE This pumpkin pie recipe has a few ingredients to make it even better: harvest spice cream and toasted almonds. Thanksgiving.com, USA TODAY\n\nKeep your phones and electronic devices handy\n\nIf your flight is canceled or delayed and you need to book a new flight, most people wait at their gate or head to an airline customer service desk to get help with a new ticket. That works, but you can also call the airline's reservation number to ask for help in getting a new flight, perhaps beating those in line to a seat. If your phone is low on power, keep your airline's 1-800 number handy and go looking for an old-school payphone.\n\nYou also might consider heading to the web. Many airlines have added rebooking features on their mobile apps that allow customers to select new flights during so-called \"irregular\" operations. That can be a little more difficult during the holidays when disruptions affect so many flyers, but \u2013 if your carrier's mobile app has such a feature \u2013 it's another option that might help you snag a new flight. And you can always try your hand looking for a new flight on your airline's website or app.\n\nPack your patience\n\nPerhaps the golden rule of travel, this is especially important during the busy holiday rush.\n\nLines are longer and airports and airplanes are even more crowded than normal. Nerves fray more easily. But even when things get stressful, take a deep breath and smile.

BERNSTEIN, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The midterm elections gave both Democrats and Republicans reasons to hope they have momentum going after the big prize: the 2020 presidential contest.\n\nDemocrats point to their energized base \u2013 especially among female voters \u2013 who helped them recapture the House.\n\nRepublicans still hear the cheers of the thousands of voters who turned out for the rallies President Donald Trump held in states where Democratic senators were defeated.\n\nAlthough Trump declared victory Wednesday, \u201cthis is one that probably cuts in either direction,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, former spokesman for President George W. Bush.\n\nRepublicans kept their midterm losses below those of the past two Democratic presidents in their first midterms, he said, but Trump still has a low approval rating despite the good economy.\n\n\u201cThe way you get that up is you have to persuade people,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cYou have to expand your coalition, not just reinforce your base.\u201d\n\nVeteran political handicapper Stuart Rothenberg said that although Trump has a \"fighting chance,\" it \u201cstill looks like a narrow path.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s are three reasons why the midterm election results were good for Trump\u2019s re-election bid and three reasons why they weren\u2019t.\n\nTrump's base remains strong\n\nThe results showed Trump has the loyalty of Republicans, Rothenberg said. \u201cHe knows how to get them excited, interested and turn them out,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s final campaign blitz of large rallies, primarily in states with close Senate races, helped fell at least three Democratic senators.\n\nRepublican National Committee spokeswoman Cassie Smedile said that not only does the midterm prove voters\u2019 support for Trump wasn\u2019t a fluke in 2016, but the party has integrated many supporters into its donor and volunteer base \u2013 and they\u2019re ready to work on 2020. \u201cThey\u2019re a fully ingrained part of our team and infrastructure,\u201d Smedile said.\n\nWins in Ohio and (maybe) Florida will help\n\nAlthough Democrats recaptured multiple gubernatorial seats Tuesday, they lost in Ohio, and their candidate initially conceded in a Florida contest that will be decided after a recount. That matters for 2020 because of the outsized role those large \u2013 and swing \u2013 states play in a presidential contest.\n\n\u201cRepublicans can\u2019t win without winning Florida and Ohio, period,\u201d said Allan Lichtman, a political historian who has correctly predicted the outcomes of all presidential elections since 1984.\n\nHaving the governor in the state be from the same party is a \u201creally, really big help\u201d for a presidential candidate, because governors have powerful statewide organizations, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nDemocrats haven't united behind a candidate\n\nBeto O'Rourke, Texas Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, talks to supporters during a stop in Austin on Wednesday. O'Rourke hopes his viral Facebook videos help lead him to victory over Republican rival U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. (Photo: Rick Jervis)\n\nDynamic Democrats such as Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Georgia energized and helped grow the Democratic base.\n\n\"The Democratic Party is back,\u201d Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez said at a breakfast roundtable Wednesday sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor. \u201cOur goal was to compete everywhere. Our goal was to reshape the electorate, and that's exactly what we have done.\"\n\nBecause those candidates lost \u2013 although Democrats hope for a runoff in Georgia \u2013 the party will continue to debate what type of candidate can win nationally and whether to nominate a moderate or liberal.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have to have someone who can keep the Democratic coalition together, who can excite suburban white women and rural African-Americans at the same time,\" Rothenberg said.\n\nTrump lost the House\n\nThe model that Lichtman, the political historian, developed to predict the outcome of presidential elections relies on 13 factors, one of which is whether the incumbent party controls more seats in the House than it did after the previous midterm. Republicans' loss of the House not only gives Trump a zero in that category but also could lead to losing another key: being untainted by scandal. Democrats' new power to investigate Trump and his administration through the House committees they will control means \u201cit\u2019s much more likely that scandals are going to appear\" that could resonate with voters in a way that past controversies haven't, Lichtman said.\n\nReturn of the blue wall\n\nTrump got over the top in 2016 with narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, states that were supposed to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cblue wall.\u201d Tuesday, Democrats won the Senate and gubernatorial contests in all three states.\n\n\u201cHis miracle states nobody thought he could win are looking Democratic again,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a GOP consultant and Trump critic.\n\nGOP pollster Dan Judy said Democrats\u2019 victories there were not decisive, showing the states can be competitive again in 2020. The biggest problem for Trump that the midterms exposed, Judy said, is he hasn\u2019t done anything to expand his coalition and remains unpopular among nonwhite voters and college-educated white voters, especially women, in urban and suburban areas.\n\n\"Given his razor-thin victory in 2016,\" Judy said, \"failing to expand the pool of voters who support him will make his re-election effort more difficult.\"\n\nDemographics are destiny\n\nDemocrats\u2019 win in the Nevada Senate race and an increasingly likely victory in the undecided Senate contest in Arizona show the West is turning purple, Lichtman said. The Georgia governor\u2019s race and Texas Senate contest indicate those states could become competitive sooner than expected, though maybe not in 2020. The immediate demographic warning sign for Trump is what happened with white Republicans, said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cThe white Republican support is markedly reduced in this election,\u201d Frey said. It\u2019s not just that support for Democrats from white women with college degrees substantially increased, but white, working-class men didn\u2019t deliver the \u201cover-the-top\u201d support for Republicans that carried Trump to victory in the Midwest in 2016.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d Frey said, \u201cthat was the big headline.\u201d\n\nMore: This is why Republicans claim voter fraud in Florida and Arizona\n\nMore: New York's Kirsten Gillibrand will give 'long, hard thought' to 2020 presidential run\n\nMore: Success in down-ballot races gives Democrats more say in congressional redistricting\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/12/midterms-trump-2020/1944282002/", "", "CLOSE Some residents evacuated from the community of Paradise, California, are staying at a church-run shelter in nearby Chico, where volunteers fear they were run out of supplies (Nov. 11) AP\n\nA firefighter looks out from the swimming pool in the backyard of a saved home after extinguishing a flare-up of the Woolsey Fire in West Hills, California.

Time\n\nNearly half the audience for CW's 'Riverdale,' which stars Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart, are watching the series online. (Photo: The CW, CW)\n\nYounger viewers are fleeing TV at an accelerated pace.\n\nThe trend should surprise no one who has seen the rise of Netflix, a resurgence of video games and a shift to digital. But new Nielsen data show a widening gap in viewing behavior among young and old that's alarming some network executives.\n\nFor the four weeks ending Oct. 28, coinciding with the start of the official TV season, the number of people ages 18 to 34 using TV has plunged 15% and is down 36% from 2014. The drop-off among teens \u2013 18% from last year and 48% since 2014 \u2013 is even more pronounced.\n\n\"It looks like a big, daunting number,\" says Peter Katsingris, senior VP of audience insights at Nielsen, and marks a sharp contrast with the mere 2% drop from 2017 among folks 55 and older, the most loyal viewers. But he says it reflects the new millennial mindset.\n\n\"Younger generations are growing up with more choices at their fingertips,\" he says. \"They don't know that you had to watch at 3 o'clock on a Wednesday if you wanted to see a show.\" For them, dependency on a network schedule is \"like looking at a typewriter.\"\n\nIn fact, the very definition of TV watching has changed. A broader measure of television usage that includes streaming through any device connected to a TV \u2013 but not websites or mobile apps \u2013 shows a less worrisome 5% yearly drop.\n\nAnd, as often happens, executives question the reliability of Nielsen data, suggesting it could prove another statistical blip. But all signs point to contrary evidence: For the three months ending Sept. 30, cable and satellite systems reported the loss of another 1 million customers, the largest quarterly drop yet. (About 40% of homes led by millennials don't subscribe to cable or satellite services.)\n\nBrian Hughes, executive VP at ad firm Magna, projects that 47% of the video watched by the 18-to-34 crowd is streaming, up from 41% last year and 21% in 2014, and he expects the figure to top 50% in 2019.\n\nFor CW, which targets the audience that's bailing from TV schedules, \"multiplatform\" viewing over a longer time span \"has always been part of our business model,\" says network president Mark Pedowitz. But that pace is accelerating.\n\nClose to half of the \"Riverdale\" audience is online, on CW's own app and website, and for the new \"Charmed\" remake the figure is 40% to 45%, he says. (\"The Flash\" is also among its most heavily streamed series.)\n\nMTV is responding to the declining usage among its core audience with a 36% boost in original programming since 2016, using lower-cost shows produced in-house, which has led to ratings increases. As an insurance policy, the network also has shifted its target audience \u2013 once the most fickle 12-to-34 age group \u2013 to seek 18-to-49-year-olds with shows including a revival of 2009 reality series \"Jersey Shore.\"\n\n\"We flipped the strategy,\" says Chris McCarthy, president of MTV and sibling channels, who now sees it as a \"youth-culture brand\" rather than a TV network. And MTV no longer even wants its TV for some projects: Last month it signed a deal to relaunch reality series \"The Real World\" on Facebook Watch, and it plans similar online revivals of former shows including \"Aeon Flux,\" \"Daria\" and \"Undressed.\"\n\n\"We're turning streaming viewers into our new customers,\" he says.\n\nThe 1992 cast of MTV's \"The Real World.\" The trailblazing reality series is being reinvented -- not on TV, but Facebook Watch. (Photo: NONE, XXX MTV)\n\nBut other programmers have hastened the decline by selling reruns of their shows to Netflix and other streaming rivals, who are using them to steal viewers. Two-thirds of all TV homes in the USA now subscribe to Netflix, Amazon and/or Hulu. That's why Disney and Warner Media are belatedly planning streaming apps of their own.\n\n\"Many networks are going to be under stress to adapt, and some are not going to make it,\" predicts Kevin Reilly, president of TNT and TBS. \"I think it's going to be a very tumultuous time with the fraying of the audience\" as fewer viewers translate to lower ad revenue, the lifeblood of the traditional TV business.\n\nShows like NBC's \"The Good Place\" and ABC's \"A Million Little Things\" have modest ratings on TV but gain a substantial portion of their young-adult viewership over time on digital platforms.\n\nKristen Bell and Ted Danson in NBC's 'The Good Place,' which gets a substantial portion of its younger viewers online. (Photo: NBC, Colleen Hayes/NBC)\n\nHughes says advertisers should be \"smarter about how we reach younger people\" on traditional TV or \"be more cool with targeting older demographics than we used to,\" a refrain often heard from the likes of senior-skewing CBS.\n\nSome executives hold out hope that younger people will mimic their parents' behavior as they age and return to TV. But others aren't buying it, and the pace of technological change argues against that behavior.\n\n\"They were born swiping,\" Reilly says. And that may translate to fewer shows from media companies. \"At a certain point, if you're feeling economic stress, you're doing more with less,\" he says.\n\nSo-called peak TV, with \"dozens of networks making big bets on dozens of shows, will be pared back.

(Photo: Sang Tan, AP)\n\nLess than a third of Americans, and only one in five teenagers, meet new physical fitness guidelines issued by the federal government Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services said.\n\nThe guidelines, which officials said could be easily achieved by most, recommend the same level of exercise as the original standards released in 2008 but without the expectation that the physical activity occur in 10-minute blocks.\n\nThey call on adults to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity and two sessions of muscle-strengthening activity each week. Children ages 6 through 17 should get at least 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per day and three sessions of muscle-strengthening per week.\n\nModerate-intensity activity includes walking briskly, riding a bike on level ground with few hills and playing doubles tennis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMuscle-strengthening activity includes lifting weights, \"heavy gardening,\" such as shoveling, and yoga.\n\nCardiologist William Kraus, a Duke University medical school professor who served on the advisory committee for the guidelines, said the 10-minute block was removed because it could have discouraged some people who didn't have that much time from moving.\n\nHe noted that parking farther from entrances and taking the stairs count as exercise.\n\nKathleen Tullie, Reebok's director of social responsibility and founder of the company's BOKS school fitness program, is shown with students at Gladstone Elementary School students in Azusa, Calif. in July 2017. (Photo: BOKS)\n\nSome people might have thought, \"If I can\u2019t do 10 minutes, it won\u2019t count, so why should I do it?\" he said.\n\nThe guidelines emphasize decreasing sitting time for adults. Children younger than 6 years old were included for the first time.\n\nThe guidelines and related reports, published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, say the failure to meet the recommended levels of aerobic physical activity leads to nearly $117 billion in annual health care costs and 10 percent of all premature death.\n\nHHS called on employers, the medical care industry, youth sports leaders and technology companies to help get people to be more active.\n\nStill, the lack of what Reebok's director of social responsibility Kathleen Tullie called \"actionable or accountability standards\" reduce the impact the guidelines can have, she said.\n\n\"There is no mechanism in place requiring kids to move during school and holding school\u2019s accountable,\" said Tullie, founder and executive director of BOKS, a school-based fitness program. \"We still prioritize the core academic subjects over the health and wellness of our children. This has to change.\"\n\nPhysician Brett Giroir is assistant secretary of health in the Department of Health and Human Services. (Photo: HHS)\n\nAssistant Health Secretary Brett Giroir called the guidelines \"truly a call for action.\"\n\nMuch more is known about the benefits of exercise since the guidelines were first released 10 years ago, Giroir said.\n\nBack then, he said, HHS knew only that exercise helped reduce the incidence of breast and colon cancers. Now, it is known to help against six other cancers, including stomach and esophageal cancer.\n\nIt helps reduce anxiety, blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease and improve brain function and learning.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order in February to develop a national strategy to expand opportunities for kids to participate in youth sports, encourage regular physical activity and active play and promote good nutrition. HHS plans to fund community programs that increase sports participation in the \"coming months.\"\n\nIn this Monday, Feb. 2, 2015 photo, a participant jumps into the air as Carole Steinhauser, right, leads a Cutthroat Cardio class at a Crunch Gym in Miami Beach, Fla.Crunch's latest workout is modeled after the T.V. show \"Cutthroat Kitchen\". (Photo: Lynne Sladky, AP)\n\nJim Baugh, who founded the fitness advocacy, nonprofit group PHIT America, said even the dire picture painted in the federal reports may be too optimistic. He said he wishes there was more focus on what schools \u2013 which regularly eliminate physical fitness in favor of teaching time \u2013 could do to address the problem.\n\n\"They're showing how bad America is, but it may be even worse,\" said Baugh, a former president of Wilson Sporting Goods. \"The inactivity pandemic is getting worse, especially for low-income Americans and kids.\"\n\nRussell Pate, a professor in the University of South Carolina's exercise science department who was on the advisory committee, agreed schools need to take action.\n\nThe new guidelines urge schools and colleges to offer physical education, after-school sports, public access to school facilities after school, expanded intramural sports and other opportunities for campus recreation. Pate said he's \"very hopeful\" these actions will be \"widely adopted over the next decade.\"\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people online who have overcome or are struggling with health problems mentioned in this story, join USA TODAY\u2019s \"I Survived It\" Facebook support group.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/12/physical-fitness-aerobic-activity-sports-social-media-health-human-services-department/1943318002/", "A chicken eatery called Big Chicken will debut on a Carnival Cruise Line ship in 2020.

We think this is something fun that our guests would really like.'\"\n\nO'Neal's first Big Chicken restaurant just opened in Las Vegas in late October and he plans more locations in Los Angeles and Atlanta. O'Neal recently documented the process of opening the first venue in an eight-episode Facebook Watch series called Big Chicken Shaq.\n\nRELATED: The early icons of the Carnival fleet\n\nDuffy says the Big Chicken planned for Radiance will offer a variety of fried chicken sandwiches, fries and other sides during the day, all free of charge. For breakfast, it'll serve chicken and egg biscuits among other options. It'll be located toward the back of the ship's Lido Dock near one of the Guy Fieri-themed Guy's Burger Joint outlets that are on all Carnival ships.\n\n\"People love the Guy's burgers. They can't get enough of that, and we think this is a great complement to that,\" Duffy says.\n\nDuffy adds that Carnival brass and O'Neal saw humor in the idea of a chicken-focused eatery on a cruise ship.\n\n\"We had lots of laughs talking about Chicken of the Sea,\" she says, referencing the well-known canned seafood brand. \"This is going to be our Chicken of the Sea, (but) no it is not tuna fish. It's chicken, big chicken, from Shaq.\"\n\nThe new Big Chicken eatery will be just one of nearly a dozen new food and drink venues opening on Radiance when it emerges in 2020 from what is billed as one of the biggest makeovers of a cruise ship ever. Dating to the early 2000s, the 2,758-passenger vessel currently was previously called Carnival Victory but will be renamed Radiance after the $200 million overhaul.\n\nRELATED: Carnival Victory to be renamed after massive makeover\n\nThe Radiance makeover will also include the addition of more than 100 cabins and the revamping of existing cabins. Also in the plans is the addition of a new deck-top recreation area with a suspended ropes course, basketball court and miniature golf course. The ship also will get a new water park area with two massive slides.\n\nDuffy says the Big Chicken eatery planned for Radiance may be just the first of many across Carnival's 26-vessel fleet.\n\n\"Assuming it's successful, I think we'll see it on more ships,\" she says, adding that it'll depend on passenger feedback. \"We think Big Chicken really will resonate with our guests.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/11/12/shaquille-oneal-big-chicken-eatery-debut-carnival-cruise-ship/1974486002/", "None\n\nThe English Proficiency Index by EF Education First also ranks the countries where you're most likely to struggle if you don't know the local language.

(Photo: Cristobal Herrera, epa-efe)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Six days after polls closed in the 2018 midterm elections, some major races remain undecided and legal battles have begun as anxious politicians express concern about the delay in the final results.\n\nElection workers are still counting ballots in Arizona's Senate race, in which Democrat Kyrsten Sinema holds a narrow lead over Republican Martha McSally. In Florida, a recount is underway in both the governor's and Senate races. In Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams refuses to concede, though her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, holds a 60,000-vote lead and claimed victory.\n\nHere's a look at where the races stand:\n\nArizona\n\nAs of Sunday night, Sinema led McSally by 32,292 votes, or 1.5 percent. There were about 215,000 votes left uncounted, and McSally faces an uphill battle because Sinema won three of the four counties where there are still uncounted ballots.\n\nTo tie the race, McSally would have to beat Sinema by about 15 percentage points in the remaining ballots, according to an analysis by The Arizona Republic. According to the Republic, the delay in the result is mostly due to the need to verify signatures for voters who voted by mail.\n\nBroward County recounts 700,000 ballots amid fraud allegations (Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\u201cWith the latest ballot count, Kyrsten\u2019s lead is insurmountable,\" Andrew Piatt, Sinema's campaign manager, said in a statement Sunday.\n\nMcSally's campaign called on voters to report any voting irregularities they might have experienced. National Republican figures, including President Donald Trump and the National Republican Senate Committee, have suggested that Democrats are \"cooking the books.\"\n\nMore: Kyrsten Sinema widens lead again over Martha McSally in pivotal day for Arizona's U.S. Senate race\n\nFlorida\n\nThe state that was home to the most-watched recount in history in 2000 is amid a statewide machine recount of more than 8 million votes.\n\nFlorida's secretary of state ordered recounts Saturday for the Senate race \u2013 in which Republican Gov. Rick Scott held a 12,562-vote, or 0.15 percent, lead over incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson \u2013 and the race for governor, in which Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by fewer than 34,000 votes, or a margin of .41 percent, according to the Florida Division of Elections.\n\nThe recount must be completed by 3 p.m. Thursday.\n\nNelson filed a lawsuit Monday against the Florida Department of State asking that ballots be counted that were postmarked before Election Day but didn't arrive until after the polls closed.\n\nScott, who filed his own legal motions trying to make sure ineligible votes aren't counted, accused election officials in the Democratic strongholds of Broward and Palm Beach Counties of \"rampant fraud\" and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. Monday, Scott called Nelson a \"sore loser\" who is \"trying to steal an election.\"\n\nTrump called for Scott and DeSantis to be declared the winners in a tweet Monday, arguing an \"honest vote count is no longer possible\" because the ballots are \"massively infected.\"\n\nBroward Chief Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter said Monday that he saw no evidence of fraud in Broward County and urged both sides to \"ramp down the rhetoric.\"\n\nFlorida election overtime: Andrew Gillum pulls back concession as Ron DeSantis calls for unity\n\nMore: Recount off to a slow start in Florida's Senate, governor races\n\nGeorgia\n\nThe contentious race for Georgia's open governor's seat remains undeclared. Abrams said there are thousands of uncounted provisional ballots that could push her into recount territory. Kemp, her opponent who stepped down as Georgia secretary of state after the election, held a 58,875-vote, or 1.5 percent, lead.\n\nSaturday, Kemp's campaign accused Abrams of ignoring the will of the people and \"making up numbers\" to keep the race alive. \"Abrams\u2019 antics are a disgrace to democracy and completely ignore the will of the people,\" the Kemp campaign said in a statement.\n\nAbrams accused Kemp of \"voter suppression\" by disproportionately rejecting African-American voter registration applications before the election. Sunday, her campaign filed a lawsuit challenging the rejection of absentee and provisional ballots and asking that they be counted.\n\n'A disgrace to democracy': Democrat Stacey Abrams pressured to concede Georgia race\n\nHouse races\n\nThe Democrats took control of the House of Representatives last Tuesday. The question is how large their majority will be.\n\nThere are nine House races that remain uncalled by the Associated Press: three in California, one in Georgia, one in Maine, one in New Jersey, two in New York and one in Utah. Republicans lead in five of those races.\n\nIf those margins hold, Democrats would end up with 231 House seats (they had 193 before the election), and Republicans would have 204 (down from 235).\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes; Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Ronald J.

Trysta Krick breaks down the biggest storylines from the weekend's action. USA TODAY\n\nRams defensive end Dante Fowler (56) reacts with Aaron Donald after recovering a fumble against the Seahawks. (Photo: Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThough the slate of games in Week 10 showcased a number of blowouts, there were still plenty of surprising results and seemingly inexplicable upsets. Here are winners and losers from Sunday\u2019s action.\n\nWinners\n\nLos Angeles Rams: One week after losing their first game of the year to the Saints, the Rams bounced back and still haven\u2019t lost consecutive games since coach Sean McVay took over the team. It was closer than they wanted, but with a 36-31 victory against the division-rival Seahawks, the Rams kept pace with New Orleans in the race for the No. 1 seed in the NFC. L.A. still has one of the most potent offenses in the league, but it was positive that it was a late defensive stand that sealed the victory. Limiting the Seahawks to two of nine third-down conversions and only 141 passing yards \u2014 as well as sacking Russell Wilson four times \u2014 showed that the defense can be counted on to win games, too.\n\nGreg Williams and Freddie Kitchens: Williams won his first game as interim coach of the Browns in the post-Hue Jackson era, 28-16, over the Falcons. And Kitchens, the new offensive coordinator, has Cleveland\u2019s offense humming. Rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield had as many incompletions as he did touchdowns (three). Mayfield\u2019s first misfire of the day came in the middle of the third quarter. Rookie running back Nick Chubb exploded for 209 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns on only 23 touches. There was always plenty of young talent in Cleveland, but even if Williams and Kitchens don\u2019t stick in Cleveland, their initial auditions for other jobs are off to promising starts.\n\nNew Orleans Saints: They knocked off the Rams last week and, right now, they look like the best team in football after a 51-14 stomping of the Bengals in Cincinnati. Over the past seven games, the Saints have scored 38.4 points a game. Over the last five games, quarterback Drew Brees has thrown 29 incompletions, but has scored 14 total touchdowns over that span. Also, this idea that the Saints are a different team on the road? We can probably put that to rest after this one.\n\nJulio Jones: After going 343 days between touchdown receptions, the Atlanta Falcons receiver hauled in his second in seven days. Not only that, but Jones smashed an NFL record, becoming the fastest player to tally 10,000 receiving yards. Jones did it in just 104 games. The next closest player, former Detroit Lion Calvin Johnson needed 115 to get there. Atlanta did lose to Cleveland, but if Jones continues this pace, he could wind up as the best to ever play when it\u2019s all said and done.\n\nLosers\n\nTodd Bowles: It might just be time to blow it up for the New York Jets. The Bills entered the game with the second-worst record in the AFC and as the lowest-scoring team in football, putting up just 10.7 points a game. All Buffalo did was hang 41 on New York in a humiliating blowout. This was a team quarterbacked by Matt Barkley, who signed this week and who hadn\u2019t played in a game since 2016. This was at home. An offensive lineman, Dion Dawkins, caught a touchdown. Bowles is a defensive specialist and this loss was inexcusable. The Jets fell to 3-7 and Bowles plummeted to 23-35 in three-plus seasons with the team. He might very well have coached his last game in New York.\n\nNew England Patriots: Thanks in part to some former players and coaches, the Tennessee Titans embarrassed New England in a 34-10 beatdown. This was one of the worst offensive performances from the Pats all season long, and it was due in large part to a familiar nemesis: interior pass pressure. Coach Mike Vrabel \u2014 a Patriot linebacker and Tom Brady teammate from 2001-08 \u2014 and defensive coordinator Dean Pees \u2014 who held the same role for New England from 2006-09 \u2014 dialed up constant pressure in Brady\u2019s face, sacking him four times and hitting him six more. The Pats (7-3) enter their bye week. But with the Steelers (6-2-1) and Chiefs (9-1) both winning this week, the battle for home-field advantage in the AFC just got a lot tougher for New England.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: Their records may not have indicated it, but Sunday night\u2019s game between the Cowboys and the Eagles was pivotal in the NFC East. The Redskins (6-3) won their game and remain in first place. But with Dallas beating Philadelphia, 27-20, both squads are now 4-5, with the Cowboys holding the tiebreaker. A two-game lead is a nice cushion, but the Eagles missed a chance at home to pull within one game of first. And with two games left against Washington, one against the Rams (9-1), and one against the Saints (8-1), the road for the defending Super Bowl champs to get back into the postseason will be a challenge.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: Even with star running back Leonard Fournette returning from a nagging hamstring injury, the Jags started slowly and lost their fifth-straight game, 29-26, to the Colts. Both teams entered tied at 3-5 and both needed to win to avoid plunging to last place in the AFC South. Most concerning is a defense that has yielded far too many explosive plays. Now, with the Texans (6-3) in command in the division, Jacksonville is in very real danger of missing the playoffs after it reached the AFC title game last year.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

That was the first time I'd really experienced someone taking my voice and balling it up and distorting it. And I was like, 'Wait, people! This isn't who I am.\"\n\nAt the time she brushed off the criticism, but in hindsight, she said that may not have been the right move.\n\n\"I don't think we do each other a service by pretending hurtful things don't hurt,\" she concluded. \"That's what I've come to. I need to own that hurt, to talk about it. I need to process it for myself so I can heal. But at the time, I wasn't going to allow myself to feel victimized.

It\u2019s something else entirely to lack the wherewithal to make interest payments, and that\u2019s where we may be heading.\n\nTreasury Department (Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAlmost inevitably, it seems, the last question I receive after giving an economic outlook presentation is about the deficit. Why the last question? I sometimes wonder. Perhaps it\u2019s the same reason the issue seemed to be on the backburner this election season.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because the size of the federal deficit has little bearing on next year\u2019s GDP growth or unemployment rate. After all, people attending outlook conferences are especially interested in the near term. Or perhaps it\u2019s because President Trump\u2019s trade war and migration battles, generally raised early in Q&A sessions, can have immediate effects on local manufacturing and agricultural operations.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, it\u2019s because most people think the deficit doesn\u2019t really matter. This in spite of the fact that in 2018, according to the U.S. Treasury\u2019s public debt reckoning, we will see \u201cthe highest annual debt issuance since $1.586 trillion in 2010, when the U.S. economy was still crawling out of a recession.\u201d But let\u2019s face it, we have been hearing about growing deficits and debt most of our lives, and so far, nothing serious seems to have happened.\n\nSoon we may not be able to pay interest on debt\n\nWhatever the reason for our benign neglect, the now-rapidly growing deficit does matter \u2014 and the interest cost of the debt is why it matters. It\u2019s one thing to run in the red. It\u2019s something else entirely to lack the wherewithal to make interest payments, and that\u2019s where we may be heading.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)\u2019s September estimates, given just before the books were closed for the 2018 fiscal year, the \u201cBig Five\u201d spending categories for Federal government outlays for the year were as follows: Social Security benefits, $918 billion; Medicare, $563 billion; Medicaid, $356 billion; military, $552 billion; and net interest on the public debt, $343 billion.\n\nThe federal deficit for the 2018 fiscal year is estimated to be $895 billion, up $222 billion from 2017. Of the Big Five, interest payments have grown the fastest, rising 19.2 percent in 2018. Each of the other categories is up by less than 10 percent.\n\nMore: Despite strong GDP, low unemployment rate, we should prepare for economic disruption\n\nThe federal budget deficit is soaring, and you can blame it all on Republican tax cuts\n\nCuts in Social Security and Medicare are inevitable. Delaying reform will make it worse.\n\nThere are three reasons why interest costs are rising so much. First, the level of debt has grown significantly in the last year; second, interest rates are higher; and third, inflation is rising, which raises the interest cost on inflation-adjusted bonds.\n\nWe can get a sobering view of the deficit spending problem by looking at the CBO\u2019s estimate for federal government spending beyond the Big Five categories. The amount spent for all the rest of government sums to $1.148 trillion \u2014 or just a bit less than four times the interest cost of the debt.\n\nNow, let\u2019s play some number games. Assume that all the Big Five expenditures except for interest costs are held constant. Then suppose the average interest rate paid by the U.S. Treasury for all debt outstanding rises from the September 2018 level of 2.86 percent to the September 2008 level of 4.652 percent. Put another way, what if the interest rate on the debt rose by 62 percent?\n\nIt's time to cut spending now to avoid disaster\n\nIf so, America\u2019s debt interest costs would rise from $343 billion to a whopping $555 billion, which is slightly more than current defense spending. To finance a cost equal to that of a second American military, we\u2019d either have to make painful cuts to all the other categories \u2014 in the Big Five and beyond \u2014 or borrow even more, which would of course mean more total debt and even more interest costs. That\u2019s not a solution at all.\n\nA quick scan of the possibilities puts us face-to-face with the tough \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 political challenges. Social Security cuts? No way. Medicare? Come on. Give me a break. Medicaid? Not in your lifetime. Defense? Wait a minute, we just started building it back up. Somewhere else in government? EPA, the big one? Not a lot of wiggling room here.\n\nThat\u2019s an oversimplification, but a useful one. Maybe we can dodge the bullet. But we can\u2019t deny that the federal deficit is a serious problem, and one that we the living must face.\n\nWe can\u2019t know when the bite will come, but all it would take is for interest rates, driven by inflation and a stronger world economy, to climb toward levels seen just 10 years ago. The Fed has promised three more rate increases in just the next year. Indeed, the CBO is predicting even higher future rates.\n\nThe solution? Start cutting the growth of spending now. The economy is booming. Now\u2019s the time to get serious.\n\nBruce Yandle is a distinguished adjunct fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, dean emeritus of the Clemson University College of Business and Behavioral Science, and coauthor of September\u2019s \u201cThe Economic Situation\u201d policy brief.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMILAN (AP) \u2014 Gonzalo Higuain was so desperate to make his mark against his former team that it proved to be his downfall.\n\nAfter missing a first-half penalty, Higuain was sent off late in AC Milan's 2-0 loss at home to Juventus for arguing with the referee following a booking.\n\n\"I want to apologize to the team, the fans and the coach for my reaction,\" Higuain said after the game. \"The referee knows what I told him, and I think sometimes they have to understand the situations. But he made his decision and I want to apologize again.\"\n\nHiguain was excited to prove Juventus wrong when it arranged his departure in the offseason to make room for Cristiano Ronaldo, and his mental state had even been questioned by coach Gennaro Gattuso in the buildup to the match.\n\n\"When you play against a team where you used to play, the emotions are different, but I take responsibility and it won't happen again,\" said Higuain, reiterating that it had not been his decision to leave Juventus. \"I am a very emotional person and player, and sometimes it's difficult to control my feelings. Sometimes I should react less, but that's how I am.\n\n\"I'm aware that we (players) are also an example to children, and my reaction wasn't the right one. But we're not robots.\"\n\nHiguain had just one shot on target and was clearly growing frustrated even before being shown what he thought was a harsh yellow card by the referee.\n\nThe Argentina forward was in tears after then being shown a red card and had to be led away by teammates as well as by Juventus players \u2014 including Ronaldo, who scored Juve's second goal.\n\nHiguain apologized to the referee after the match and was also defended by Juventus players, who said they hoped he wouldn't face a lengthy ban.\n\n\"I told Higuain not to go over the top, so as not to risk further punishment,\" Ronaldo said. \"He was nervous, he was losing. But we absolutely shouldn't blame him. He didn't say anything.\"\n\nThe match highlighted Higuain's historic weaknesses: missing penalties in big games and losing his temper when things don't go his way.\n\nSZCZESNY'S SAVE\n\nHiguain wasn't entirely to blame for his missed penalty.\n\nJuventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny guessed the direction correctly and managed to tip Higuain's weak effort onto his right post \u2014 even though the spot kick was well angled.\n\n\"I was fortunate but I was also focused on Higuain's shot,\" Szczesny said. \"And Ronaldo had told me to move earlier.\"\n\nSzczesny has had the difficult task of replacing Gianluigi Buffon in Juve's goal this season, but he has managed to keep the starting job ahead of Mattia Perin.\n\n\"It's important to have continuity and Perin motivates me,\" Szczesny said. \"(Replacing) Buffon is always tough, but with this defense, it's easier to make a mistake than to do well.\"\n\nNEVER SAY DIE NAPOLI\n\nNapoli's has come back from at least one goal down to either win or draw five times this season \u2014 four times in Serie A and once in the Champions League.\n\nIts latest turnaround came at Genoa on Saturday, fighting back to win 2-1 after the match was suspended for 15 minutes due to torrential rain.\n\nNapoli has earned 10 points from those comebacks \u2014 more than any other club in the league \u2014 and remains in second place as it seeks a first Serie A title since Diego Maradona led it to its only two Italian championships in 1987 and 1990.\n\nNapoli's biggest comeback of the season was a 3-2 win over AC Milan in which it trailed 2-0 in the second half.\n\nCOACHING CAROUSEL\n\nThree Serie A clubs have made in-season coaching changes this season and two of them might be about to make further moves.\n\nFormer Italy coach Gian Piero Ventura announced he was resigning after guiding last-place Chievo Verona to a 2-2 draw with Bologna, but the club was trying to convince him to stay.\n\nIt was Chievo's first point in four matches since Ventura was hired a month ago to replace Lorenzo D'Anna.\n\nAlso, Genoa coach Ivan Juric is at risk ahead of the upcoming derby against Sampdoria.\n\nJuric was hired a month ago to replace Davide Ballardini, but Genoa has since managed only two draws and two losses.\n\nAnother firing could be on hand for Julio Velazquez at Udinese, which has lost six and drawn one of its last seven matches.\n\n___\n\nDampf reported from Rome.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Wochit\n\nApple Watch Series 4 (Photo: Apple)\n\nIf you tossed your old fitness tracker into the junk drawer years ago because you got tired of counting steps, then you might want to have a look at this fall\u2019s crop of wearables.\n\nA lot\u2019s changed. The devices are savvier about health, wellness and fitness. They\u2019re also sleeker, smarter and run longer between charges. They know when you\u2019re sleeping. They know when you\u2019re, uh, working out.\n\nWhen it comes to your lifestyle, they can even tell if you\u2019ve been bad or good. Amidst the glitter and smarts, though, there are a few signs wearables are still growing into their newfound capabilities.\n\nFor the past month, I\u2019ve been evaluating four new wearables: two from market leaders Apple and Fitbit, the Apple Watch Series 4 and Charge 3, respectively, as well as Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Watch. While they have many features in common, there are also plenty of differences.\n\nSo while there\u2019s no clear winner, there may very well be a clear choice for what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nApple Watch Series 4\n\nThe Series 4 device is sleek and beautiful. And though the device is smarter, many of the sensors it relies on are the same as what\u2019s in the Series 3. Apple did upgrade the accelerometer, and also added an electrical heart sensor into the flat end of the dial.\n\nThose two enhancements enabled Apple to introduce a pair of unique monitoring features. The first is fall detection, which requires the heavier-duty accelerometer. Fall detection is important if you\u2019re active\u2014and alone\u2014for extended periods, like trail runners and the elderly. The second feature watches for irregular heartbeats, and then prompts you to record an ECG with the electrical heart sensor.\n\nThe Apple Watch is the only device with fall detection, though it\u2019s not the only one capable. Emergency response firm MobileHelp, for example, offers fall detection as a service on Samsung\u2019s Gear S3, the predecessor to the Galaxy Watch. And Fitbit sells the capability on its trackers as part of a corporate wellness program marketed to employers.\n\nMore: The high costs of repairing an Apple i-device\n\nMore: A look at the new Apple Watch Series 4\n\nMore: Apple, Amazon make peace before the holidays as latest iPhones, iPads head to the retailer\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to test fall detection because I didn\u2019t actually fall. I also wasn\u2019t able to test heart-arrhythmia detection and the companion ECG app because it\u2019s promised for later this year.\n\nFor all the Series 4 does offer, it\u2019s mystifying Apple didn\u2019t include features many consider baseline today: specifically, sleep-stage tracking and multi-day battery life. I suspect the two are interrelated. In other words, if your watch isn\u2019t tracking sleep, then you probably won\u2019t mind charging it every night.\n\nBest gifts for dad: Fitbit Charge 3 (Photo: Fitbit)\n\nFitbit Charge 3\n\nIf you have the Ionic or Versa, the smartwatches Fitbit announced over the past year, then you already know what the Charge 3 can do. The Ionic broke new ground when it was introduced a year ago, setting the bar for smartwatches with a great combination of valuable new health metrics combined with multi-day battery life. The Charge 3 offers the same health metrics, and even more battery life: seven days instead of four.\n\nWhat you gain in battery over the Apple Watch, you give up in display. The Charge 3 is a fitness tracker, with a thin, black-and-white screen. It can alert you to texts, emails, appointments\u2014everything the Apple Watch can, just not nearly so elegantly.\n\nI\u2019ve come to trust the circa-2018 Fitbits for sleep-stage stats, resting heart rate and VO2 Max, the de facto fitness measure. VO2 Max measures how much oxygen your body can process during intense exertion. It\u2019s measured in a lab, though wearables estimate by tracking your heart rate for a given pace. If you don\u2019t bother to go outside and enable your GPS, your wearable can still approximate your pace, though results aren\u2019t as precise.\n\nThe VO2 Max estimates from the Charge 3 are more or less consistent with stress test results from my cardiologist \u2013 that is to say, pretty good. More than the raw number, though, I\u2019m more taken with watching the impact my lifestyle has on my fitness. The estimates dip, for example, during periods of intense travel.\n\nThe Apple Watch measures VO2 Max. Thus far, though, it\u2019s reported an unrealistically low estimate, which puts me in the lowest \u201cvery poor\u201d range for my age. In fairness to Apple, I may not have given the device enough opportunity to adequately estimate. VO2 Max is very difficult to gauge \u2013 even more so when the subject (that\u2019s me) won\u2019t go out for a run. In my experience, it takes a good month of steady wear to hone in. As I have three devices swapping time on just two wrists, the Apple Watch hasn\u2019t seen that much of me yet.\n\nEven more confounding is my go-to aerobic activity: the elliptical, one the hardest workouts to detect because the legs move more slowly than during other aerobic exercises. It\u2019s even harder for wearables to spot elliptical training when you don\u2019t grab the poles. Which I don\u2019t.\n\nIn fact, the Apple Watch is the only device of the pack that ever detected elliptical workouts, though it didn\u2019t do it consistently.\n\nA 46mm Samsung Galaxy Watch. (Photo: Samsung)\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch\n\nThe Galaxy Watch sits squarely between the Apple Watch and Charge 3 in form and function. It\u2019s got a bright, beautiful display and a sturdy, attractive build. I\u2019ve got the larger, 46mm unit, which is the largest in the roundup. It\u2019s also decidedly masculine. Samsung offers smaller, 42mm Watch models that may be attractive to women as well as men.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung has erased substantially all the shortcomings from previous models. The Galaxy Watch does continual heartrate monitoring. It can auto-detect sleep and exercise. It can measure stress and sleep stages. And best of all, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it has multi-day battery life.\n\nIn my experience with the Galaxy Watch, you can bank on three days between charges, double what I saw with the Gear S3. In fact, when I went to the Bay Area for a recent three-day, two-night business trip with this collection of wearables, the only charger I needed was for the Apple Watch.\n\nI have not yet seen VO2 Max exposed, though the Galaxy Watch is capable. But I have seen a reading for oxygen saturation, another new capability. The feature would be better if the watch offered suggestions for managing the metric.\n\nBest for You\n\nAll three devices are similarly capable. Apple has paved some new ground by offering fall detection and irregular heart rate monitoring. But the Apple Watch is also the only one that doesn\u2019t go beyond basic sleep tracking to monitor REM, light sleep and deep sleep. If that\u2019s not important to you, then you may not see its short battery life as a shortcoming either.\n\nIt\u2019s also a beautiful device that does a great job of interfacing with your phone. Your iPhone, that is. The Apple Watch doesn\u2019t do Android.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a new wearable primarily for health and fitness, then consider the Charge 3. More than just the metrics, I like the way they\u2019re presented in the app. VO2 Max and resting heart rate trends are two graphs I\u2019ve come to rely on as a check for how well I\u2019m taking care of myself. If the display is too minimal for your taste, you might check out Fitbit\u2019s smartwatches as well.\n\nIf you prefer a little from column A and a little from column B, then take a look at the Galaxy Watch. It is a beautiful watch, with a big bright display, multi-day battery life and a pretty full suite of health metrics. Sleep tracking isn\u2019t bad, though not quite as reliable as the Fitbit. And like the Charge 3, it will work with both Android and iOS.\n\nWhichever way you decide to go, all three offer enough brains and beauty to keep from getting sentenced to the junk drawer with your old tracker.\n\n--------\n\nMike Feibus is the principal analyst at FeibusTech, a Scottsdale, Arizona, market strategy and analysis firm focusing on health tech, mobile ecosystems and client technologies.

(Photo: The Motley Fool)\n\nNick Penze, CEO of Zerelli Technologies, had a long holiday shopping list for his company.\n\nHe wanted the Park City, Utah, designer of industrial seals to acquire a smaller manufacturer and possibly upgrade its factory, and buy new furniture and computers for Zerelli\u2019s headquarters.\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s 10-percent tariff on $200 billion in Chinese imports has reduced both Zerelli\u2019s cash flow and the revenue of its customers \u2013 such as makers of washing machines and transmissions. As a result, Penze has put his plans on hold.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it, not knowing what\u2019s going to happen in the next six months to a year,\u201d Penze says.\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans in Congress vowed that this year\u2019s big tax cut would unleash a wave of business investment that would juice economic growth. But increases in capital spending for businesses of all sizes slowed dramatically in the third quarter, raising questions about whether any tax-cut benefits are already fading. Some economists say the pullback reflects business worries over the tariffs and likely foreshadows a broader slowdown in the economy.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the hard economic data\u2026 is finally exhibiting the negative hit to planned capital spending from trade policy,\u201d research firm Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nIncreased business spending on new equipment, structures and intellectual property can be a key driver of the economy and jobs. Manufacturers of factory machines, computers and trucks need more workers to make the products while businesses that buy them need more employees to run them.\n\nMore: Stocks jump on midterm vote that results in divided Congress as Dems regain House\n\nMore: Why General Motors is offering buyouts to 18,000 GM workers: 'The world is changing'\n\nMore: Sears boss Eddie Lampert accused of possibly profiting from retailer's decline\n\nYet such business investment edged up at an annual rate of just 0.8 percent in the July-September period, down from 11.5 percent and 8.7 percent in the prior two quarters, and the smallest advance since late 2016, the Commerce Department said last month. The performance was the biggest weak spot in a report that showed the economy grew at a healthy 3.5 percent rate, following 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter.\n\nThe last time capital spending flatlined in late 2016, a downturn in oil prices was still damping investment in drilling. While volatile oil prices also played a role last quarter, business outlays would have been anemic \u2013 even without a pullback in the oil industry, says Barclays economist Jonathan Millar.\n\nIs it a blip?\n\nJoe LaVorgna, chief economist of the Americas for investment bank Natixis, downplayed the soft business spending, noting the figures can be volatile. \u201cI just don\u2019t get worried over one quarter,\u201d he says. The increase could be revised higher or it may be a blip, he says, with business investment resuming its robust growth clip in the current quarter.\n\nLaVorgna adds that he never believed the tax law \u2013 which allows companies to deduct capital purchases from their income more rapidly \u2013 would provide a short-term boost to investment. Rather, he thought it would make the U.S. a more appealing location for multinational firms by cutting tax rates. Yet with the economy still growing strongly, and 3.7 percent unemployment spawning more worker shortages, firms will need to step up their purchases of labor-saving technologies, he says.\n\nMorgan Stanley has a less sanguine view. It notes that businesses' capital spending plans fell in four of five Federal Reserve regional bank districts last month. And the research firm\u2019s national index for capital spending plans has tumbled in six of the past seven months after peaking in March.\n\nOne explanation is that the trade war with China is denting business confidence.

But the company doesn\u2019t get reimbursed by customers for up to 90 days, crimping cash flow and squashing its investment plans, Penze says. Those customers are also getting hit with tariffs as they import other parts from China, leading them to scale back production and curbing Zerelli\u2019s revenue.\n\nSome see economy slowing down\n\nBarclays' Millar says a more fundamental problem is the prospect of weakening consumer demand. The effects of the Republican tax cuts and federal spending increases are likely to start fading by next year, he says. The nine-year-old economic expansion is getting long in the tooth. And the Fed is raising interest rates to temper growth and head off a spike in inflation.\n\n\u201cWe think GDP growth is going to slow\u201d after reaching about 3 percent in 2018, Millar says. That would undermine Trump\u2019s promise of 3 percent or better growth for a sustained period. Millar says the unusually weak capital spending total last quarter likely overstated the trend. But he projects investment will slow to about 5 percent in the current quarter and 2 percent to 3 percent by the end of next year as the economy begins to sputter.\n\nMany economists predict slower growth next year and a recession in 2020.\n\nFor now, many businesses are continuing to ramp up investment.\n\nArcalea, a Chicago-based digital marketing company, increased research and development spending by 80 percent this year, says CEO Mike Stratta. He credits both the healthy economy and the growing propensity of firms to embrace digital marketing.\n\nBut Freight Motion, a shipping broker based in Austin, Texas, saw sales in September and October fall 20 percent to 30 percent from the same period a year ago, says CEO Michael Vander Hook. He says his business offers an early peek at the economy\u2019s course. Some of his customers, which range from retailers to auto manufacturers, are starting to face tougher lending standards.\n\n\u201cCompanies are pulling back dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems to me there\u2019s going to be some kind of dip.\u201d\n\nVander Hook was planning to buy a warehouse in the Austin area for $1.2 million but has decided to hold off.\n\n\u201cMaybe I should be stockpiling money instead of buying another warehouse,\u201d he says.\n\nCLOSE Houston is hiring in the oil and petroleum industries.

Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, for example, used the Berners-Lee keynote that opened the conference Monday night to call for companies, governments and Internet users to unite around a \u201cContract for the Web.\u201d\n\nIts nine principals call for meeting such goals as protecting privacy, providing universal Internet access, keeping the Internet open and universal (Berners-Lee has called for net-neutrality protections before), and building online social systems that impede harassment and hate speech but promote constructive conversations.\n\n\"As an individual, you need to hold those companies accountable,\u201d Berners-Lee said. \u201cYou need to hold those governments accountable.\"\n\nThe U.S. government may not lead on those issues, but the European Union seems prepared to. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a keynote Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere's no need to ask people to give up values like privacy, democracy, fairness in the name of innovation,\u201d she said. \"The real guarantee of an innovative future comes from keeping markets open.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference afterwards, she defended the EU\u2019s sweeping General Data Protection Regulation, which requires companies to let their customers see, edit or delete most data collected about them. Vestager said the GDPR\u2019s principles, if not its extensive details, continue to draw interest on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\n\"I find that there is sort of an increased questioning and curiosity on what we're doing in Europe,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd even if this debate does not yield a new law, many U.S. firms have decided to extend some GDPR privacy protections to U.S. users.

This should be required for kids to enroll in school.\n\nIn Miami on Sept. 21, 2011. (Photo: Joe Raedle)\n\nResearchers announced last month that thanks to a compulsory vaccine program, Australia is on track to eradicate cervical cancer. This is due to almost universal vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus which isresponsible for 90 percent of cervical cancers. The vaccine itself is a medical breakthrough and has only been available for use since 2006. In just 12 short years, cervical cancer is becoming a rarity in Australia and will eventually be eliminated, saving thousands of Australians\u2019 lives.\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each yearHPV causes cancer in 33,700 men and women in the U.S. alone. Cervical cancer is not the only cancer caused by HPV; 70 percent of oropharynx cancers, for example, which were previously attributed only to alcohol and tobacco use, are caused by HPV.\n\nIn Australia in 2016, 78.6 percent of females and 72.9 percent of males had completed the HPV vaccine series. By comparison, the CDC reports only 49 percent of U.S. adolescents completed the seriesin 2017. So why is Australia so much closer to eradicating cervical cancer than the United States?\n\nAnti-vaxxers and conservative attitudes on sex\n\nOne reason is the anti-vaccine movement, pushed into the mainstream by the former physician and con man Andrew Wakefield, who falsified research results linking autism to vaccines and planned to make millions of dollars selling a scam diagnostic test, and promoted by the likes of Jenny McCarthy, the celebrity anti-vaxxer who wrongly claimedvaccines caused her son to develop autism. McCarthy was denounced by medical scientists, but that didn\u2019t keep her from spreading her erroneous views to millions of Americans thanks to regular television appearances on \u201cOprah\u201d and \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nConservative attitudes about sex, especially as it relates to young people, have also kept many American parents from having their children vaccinated against HPV. But we need to talk about healthy sexual behaviors, as current movements like #MeToo have shown us. We need to discuss with our children ways they can remain healthy when choosing to participate in sexual activity.\n\nThis includes removing the stigma surrounding sex thatcauses unintended pregnancies and sexually-transmitted infectionsto spread because adolescents and young adults are too embarrassed to seek out contraception. Religious leaders have suggested the HPV vaccine encourages promiscuity, a claim that has been exhaustively disproven in medical research.Suggesting that protecting oneself against cancer is something to be ashamed of is an irresponsible and nefarious assertion.\n\nMore: On Election Day, will two more states go to pot?\n\nDon't jail addicts. Overdose prevention sites work, and the US needs to get on board.\n\nIt took a village to kill my brother: How families, hospitals and government fail alcoholics\n\nAs a nurse, I am still amazed that we have the ability to prevent cancer from occurring and save tens of thousands of people\u2019s lives, just through a vaccine. Yet so many of my patients still wrongly believe that vaccines are dangerous, despite my assurances. Anti-vaccine groups have gone so far as to spread false claims regarding the safety of the vaccine. The World Health Organization, the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC have all determined the HPV vaccine is safe. And the only common side effects that have been proven are ones that can occur with any vaccine, like dizziness and a reaction at the injection site.\n\nIt strikes me that my patients accept my recommendations with almost every other health decision they have to make. Why do my patients trust me when I prescribe antibiotics or anti-hypertensives, but not when I recommend the HPV vaccine? Why is Jenny McCarthy\u2019s medical opinion valued over mine?\n\nHPV vaccine should be required for school\n\nFor the Unites States to eradicate cervical cancer as Australia is on pace to do, we must include the HPV vaccine in the regular childhood vaccine schedule, and it should be required for enrollment in school.\n\nThe HPV vaccine is recommended in childhood for two reasons. First, the vaccine works best at the beginning of adolescencewhen one\u2019s body can make stronger antibodies that are required to prevent infection. Second, a child must be vaccinated before he or she has been exposed to the virus itself.\n\nMaking the choice to protect your children against cancer is the same as making them wear a seat belt or a helmet. You hope they will never need it, you hope they won\u2019t be exposed to the virus, but if they are, they will be covered. No one should die because of myths and misconceptions. We have the power to stop this virus in its tracks and protect generations of Americans from an early death. Don\u2019t American children deserve to have lives as long and healthy as those in Australia?\n\nTerry Gallagher is an assistant professor and family nurse practitioner at Rush University College of Nursing, a 2018-2019 fellow of the Duke-Johnson & Johnson Nurse Leadership Program, and a Rush Public Voices Fellow through The OpEd Project.

Iron Ox wants to build robot farms near cities to supply restaurants and supermarkets with fresh produce. Other automated indoor farms haven't panned out. (Oct. 3) AP\n\nStartups can be exciting places to work. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nFew things in life beat the excitement of starting a new business or launching a new product. Creating a startup is thrilling. Sure, there\u2019s risk \u2013 but risk can be exciting. There\u2019s also challenge and creativity \u2013 figuring out how to build something from nothing, finding money, solving problems.\n\nBut what happens when the startup is started? You built it, now what?\n\nEveryone talks about the ideal of \u201chockey stick\u201d growth for a startup \u2013 a flat bottom of sales quickly skyrocketing upward. What about when you\u2019re still at the bottom of the hockey stick \u2013 I\u2019ll call them the \u201cblade years\u201d \u2013 when your sales are basically flat, growing ever-so-slowly? How do you deal with those years?\n\nI\u2019m facing those questions right now.\n\nFor the last three years, I\u2019ve been building a new product. BizGear (https://bizgear.biz/) is a cloud-based business financial planning tool, that crunches the numbers for entrepreneurs planning their businesses\u2014from marketing budget, to staff budget, to overhead, to sales, to profit (or loss), and so much more.\n\nI\u2019ve poured nearly three years of my life\u2014and a heck of a lot of my own cash\u2014into BizGear, all while still running my publishing company.\n\nMore: How do cyber-criminals hack small business startups? Here's what we learned from Microsoft\n\nMore: For startups with creative vision, 'T-Pain's School of Business' is now in session\n\nMore: Detroit Denim: Entrepreneur's made-in-USA jeans business fits him well\n\nFirst, my team and I spent months hammering out the details of the application, the functionality, the design, the bells and whistles. We searched for developers, hired developers, fired developers, finally settled on a stellar team. We worked long days and spent many sleepless nights. We built the product. We tested. We tweaked.\n\nAnd now BizGear is ready. Our work is done, right? Wrong.\n\nLaunching a startup \u2013 whether a new business or a new product \u2013 is like climbing a mountain. You climb and climb and climb, anticipating that when you get to the top, there\u2019ll be a beautiful vista and valley. Instead, after an arduous climb, you\u2019re facing an even higher, more daunting, mountain: getting customers. The hard work of selling has begun.\n\nNo one tells you this, but here\u2019s the truth: The period after you launch is the hardest stage of your startup.\n\nNow what? Here are nine answers to that question.\n\n1. Stop tinkering.\n\nYes, your product or startup could be improved. But you need money coming in. Concentrate on that.\n\n2. A feeling of let-down is normal.\n\nIt helped \u2013 a lot \u2013 when our BizGear product manager told us that there\u2019s always a let-down/depression period after launch. We weren\u2019t alone.\n\n3. Give out \u201csamples.\u201d\n\nFew paying customers want to be \u2018early adopters.\u2019 Give your product or service away to get some customers, testimonials, feedback, experience.\n\n4. Experiment with pricing.\n\nYou probably didn\u2019t get it right at first. Go high. Go low.\n\n5. Build your lists.\n\nCollect contacts of prospects, influencers, referral sources right from the start, even before you have anything to sell. Once you\u2019re close to launch, start marketing, letting them know you\u2019re ready.\n\n6. Expect disappointment.\n\nYour former cheerleaders may not become buyers. When we had our prototype, we had many potential big customers who said BizGear was the greatest thing since sliced bread. But once we were ready? They didn\u2019t have budget or had switched jobs or their companies had purchasing freezes. Hang in there.\n\n7. Go out and make sales.\n\n8. Go out and make sales.\n\n9. Go out and make sales.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten beyond launch, your main job is to get money in from paying customers. Get out there and do it.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning a startup, have recently launched your small business, or are working on a new product or service, I wish I could tell you that once you open your doors you\u2019ll cruise along, sitting back, watching the cash roll in. Unfortunately, that\u2019s just not the case.\n\nAfter you launch, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time figuring out your pricing, knocking on customers\u2019 doors, trying out different marketing approaches, finagling your financing \u2013 and probably looking for more \u2013 possibly laying off staff, and finding some way to keep yourself optimistic, energized, and motivated.\n\nTry not to get discouraged. We entrepreneurs are an optimistic bunch, so dig deep and find that reserve of optimism I know you have.

Veuer's Mercer Morrison has the story. Buzz60\n\nKeith Villa, at left, and Jodi Villa, are launching CERIA Grainwave Belgian-Style White Ale, a nonalcoholic beer infused with THC. (Photo: Michael Allen, for CERIA Brewing Co.)\n\nThe founding brewmaster behind Blue Moon beer has a new beer that delivers a different kind of buzz.\n\nKeith Villa, who invented Blue Moon Belgian Wheat more than two decades ago, next month will launch the first beer from new venture CERIA Brewing Co. But Grainwave Belgian-Style White Ale will be quite different than Blue Moon.\n\nFor starters, the beverage has no alcohol and includes 5 milligrams of THC, the high-producing ingredient found in cannabis plants. Made with blood orange peel and coriander, the ale \"has a richer, deeper orange character and a little different type of bitterness because of the cannabinoids,\" Villa said.\n\nGrainwave Belgian-Style White Ale will initially be available in Colorado in mid-December. But Villa hopes to expand its distribution to California and Nevada soon.\n\nCERIA Grainwave Belgian-Style White Ale is a new nonalcoholic beer infused with THC from the original Blue Moon brewmaster. (Photo: CERIA Brewing Co.)\n\nCannabis-infused beers have become trendy, but so far none released in the U.S. have THC. They typically have hemp, which gives them a taste similar to marijuana.\n\nFederal law prohibits brewers from using marijuana in beer. But CERIA's beverage doesn't contain alcohol, so it technically isn't a beer.\n\nSigns of interest in the marijuana-beer business include Molson Coors' deal, announced in August, to work with Canadian cannabis company The Hydropothecary Corp. to develop nonalcoholic marijuana drinks for the Canadian market. And Constellation Brands, maker of Robert Mondavi wine, Corona beer and Svedka vodka, last year invested $4 billion in Canopy Growth, a Canadian marijuana firm, with cannabis drinks among future plans.\n\nMore: What is CBD?

His wife, Jodi Villa, is a civil engineer and the CEO of the company in Arvada, Colorado, a northwest suburb of Denver.\n\nColorado legalized recreational marijuana four years ago and Villa became interested in its benefits.\n\n\"I quickly found that there was a lot of anecdotal evidence, as well as some conclusive evidence, that marijuana had some good things about it,\" Villa said. \"I did research and found you could brew with it and you could have beers that taste actually like beers but you have the effects\" of marijuana, without smoking it, he said.\n\nCERIA's first beer, the Belgian white, will be available in individual bottles (64 calories per bottle) costing about $9; four-packs will cost less than $36.\n\nThe brewery plans to release an American Light Lager with 2.5 milligrams of THC and an India Pale Ale with 10 milligrams during the first three months of 2019.\n\n\"The 2.5mg light beer, they can drink several of them and not get stoned, they will feel a little buzz and be happy,\" Villa said. \"The medium level one they can have a couple and start to feel it, and the high level one, they can have one and start to feel it, just like (with) an Imperial IPA.\"\n\nThe company is also looking at other cannabinoids that, while not high-producing, may relieve anxiety or promote bliss. That's territory being explored with the chemical CBD, another chemical found in hemp and marijuana, which does not produce a high but can be used to relieve pain and anxiety.\n\n\"First we will focus on THC, and we will gradually start to introduce some as the science starts to solidify around them and shows that they are safe,\" he said.\n\nThe cannabis market will likely expand as several states voted to expand marijuana usage with Michigan voters opting to legalize recreational marijuana use, while Utah and Missouri voted to legalize medical marijuana. North Dakota rejected a measure to legalize marijuana.\n\nThat's in line with CERIA's slogan \"Cannabis Pro Omnibus,\" or \"Cannabis for All.\"\n\n\"It's starting to become a movement,\" Villa said. \"We feel we are at the forefront.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/11/12/blue-moon-brewer-brings-pot-infused-beer-market/1941682002/", "", "Firefighters battle flames at a burning apartment complex in Paradise, north of Sacramento, Calif. on Nov. 09, 2018.

Fixing voting should be the top priority of the next Congress.\n\nIn Atlanta, Georgia on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: Jack Gruber/USA TODAY Network)\n\nIn many ways, Election Day 2018 was a good one for American democracy. Millions of people turned out to vote. An unprecedented number of women are headed to Congress, including the first Native American women and the first Muslim-American women to serve on Capitol Hill. In Florida, voters restored voting rights to more than a million people who had been disenfranchised for past felony convictions. In Michigan and Maryland, they approved same-day registration. In Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, and Utah, they said yes to fair legislative districts.\n\nBut at the same time, the election provided evidence of what many activists and experts have been saying for years: the machinery of our democracy needs serious maintenance. Together, aging infrastructure and resurgent voter suppression have jeopardized equal voting rights in the United States, turning what should be a source of national pride into cause for alarm.\n\nThe costs of poor preparation and outdated election equipment were plain to see. In downtown Atlanta, voters stood in line for more than three hours because only three voting machines had been sent to serve more than 3,000 people. In Richland County, South Carolina, voters reported that machines were changing their selections. Officials worked to address the issue, but the county elections director told the NAACP Legal Defense Fund that he only had one technician for every five polling sites. In Maryland, two precincts ran out of paper ballots; in Detroit and New York City, malfunctioning machines caused many voters to simply give up.\n\nWe can prevent voting problems if we want to\n\nThese snares were avoidable. According to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice, the majority of America\u2019s voting machines are obsolete. Election officials are aware of the problem, but many lack the funds they need to update their equipment. This raises the troubling possibility that wealthier districts will buy new voting machines, while poorer ones remain stuck with unreliable equipment. If we are serious about the health of our democracy, then we must not let voting become a \u201cseparate but unequal\u201d proposition before the next election.\n\nNot all the election problems were caused by technical glitches or staff shortages, however. Far too many Americans of color found themselves denied a voice by discriminatory laws and policies. In Georgia, gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp used his position as secretary of State to hold up more than 50,000 voter registrations; although a federal judge ordered the state to relax its restrictions, hundreds of voters were still turned away. In Alabama, many voters listed as \u201cinactive\u201d were told they must cast provisional ballots, even though state law allows inactive voters to cast regular ballots if they fill out a new registration form.\n\nMore: Make voting easier for everybody, not tougher\n\nI'm a former Florida congressman and my vote was rejected over a signature\n\nYear of the Woman 2: Record election success for women goes way beyond numbers\n\nAnd this does not begin to touch the rampant racial voter suppression activities that took place before the election, including the removal of the sole polling place from the City limits of Dodge City, Kansas \u2014 a town with a large Latino population; the imposition of a discriminatory voter ID law designed to suppress Native American votes in North Dakota, and in Georgia the use of a racially discriminatory \u201cexact match\u201d signature requirement for voters.\n\nSuppression didn\u2019t end when the polls closed Tuesday. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, heading for a recount in his Senate race, has made false allegations of widespread voter fraud in his state and called for law enforcement to monitor ballot counting in two counties. In Arizona, the Republican Party sued to limit the counting of mail-in ballots in the state's tight Senate race (and lost); it may take until Thursday to finish the tally. In both cases, the myth of voter fraud \u2014 which has deep roots in racially discriminatory voting practices \u2014 is being used to prevent eligible ballots from being counted.\n\nRestore Voting Rights Act, rein in discrimination\n\nLike the long lines and faulty machines, these attempts to block minority votes should not surprise us. They are the consequences of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013, which severely weakened a core provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite pushback from civil rights groups, the tide of voter suppression has only swollen in recent years, metastasizing beyond the South and into northern jurisdictions as well.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to accept the shameful state of our elections. We\u2019re about to have a new Congress, and among its most urgent priorities should be repairing our ailing voting apparatus. It should give states funds to purchase newer and more reliable voting machinery, just as it provides funding for highway repairs, natural disaster recovery and law enforcement. And it should retore the Voting Rights Act to its full power, so that states will no longer have free rein to discriminate against voters of color.\n\nRestoring the Voting Rights Act isn\u2019t unthinkable, even in these divisive times. In 2015, a bipartisan group including Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., introduced a bill to revive the federal government\u2019s election oversight power under the Voting Rights Act. It died in the House Judiciary Committee, which will soon be led by Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York. Already, Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., has proposed a new voting rights bill; Nadler should schedule hearings on it in early spring.\n\nOur democracy is facing numerous threats, many of which are the subject of fraught political conflict. Fixing the Voting Rights Act should not be one of them. It\u2019s time to move on a voting rights bill.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill is the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.

Vivian Stringer moved within one victory of 1,000 as women's college basketball tipped off its season.\n\nWhalen took over at her alma mater Minnesota this year and led the Gophers to an opening win in front of an announced crowd of 14,625. It was the most ever to watch a women's basketball game at Williams Arena. They had a lot to cheer about as the Gophers beat New Hampshire by 23 points.\n\n\"Hey, that was fun,\" Whalen said to the crowd from midcourt after the game Friday night.\n\nThe Gophers have a shot to earn their first ranking under Whalen on Monday. They were 26th in the preseason poll.\n\nWhile Whalen was celebrating her first win, hours earlier on Friday Stringer earned No. 999 with Rutgers' win over Stony Brook. She'll have her first chance at 1,000 on Tuesday night against Central Connecticut State. A win would put the Hall of Fame coach in the company of Pat Summitt, Geno Auriemma, Sylvia Hatchell and Tara VanDerveer as Division I women's basketball coaches who have won 1,000 games.\n\nIt took Stringer's Rutgers team five tries to get her win No. 900 in 2013. With many family, friends and former players coming Tuesday night, she hopes the Scarlet Knights can do it on their first try this time.\n\n\"I just want to get it over with,\" Stringer admitted. \"It's the best way for me to say that. I think that's what happened with 900, they were trying so hard to do it, you'd think it was the first game we played. They were really nervous to get it done.\"\n\nHere are other things that happened in women's college basketball this past week:\n\nRECORD ROUT: Savannah State set a school scoring record in their season opening 155-26 win over Wesleyan. The 155 points broke the old mark set during the 1975-76 season when the Lady Tigers beat Georgia Tech 141-18. It also was the most scored by a NCAA Division I team since 1987, when Long Beach State beat San Jose State 149-69.\n\nThe 129-point win also set an NCAA Division I margin of victory record, surpassing 108 points set in 2016 when Baylor defeated Winthrop 140-32. It is important to note that team Savannah State beat is a Division III program.\n\nSophomore Jacquece Alston recorded a triple-double for Savannah State with 13 points, 12 assists and 12 steals. She also had seven rebounds.\n\nREWRITING THE RECORD BOOK: Oregon junior guard Sabrina Ionescu picked up where she left off with her NCAA record 11th career triple-double in the No. 3 Ducks season opening win at Alaska.\n\nShe had 18 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds for the Ducks, who were playing the game as a homecoming for Ruthy Hebard.\n\nSOLID RANKINGS: The opening week saw the Top 25 teams only lose a game to a team not ranked when No. 21 Duke fell at Northwestern.

He had just transferred from the USS Yellowstone to a shore facility in Virginia, was looking to play for one of the intramural teams there and eventually got told that all the available spots had been taken by members of another command.\n\nSo he decided to start refereeing.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, he's still in the NBA.\n\nVeterans Day \u2014 which was observed Sunday in the U.S. though federal agencies were closed Monday \u2014 carries obvious additional significance for people like Richardson and fellow NBA refs Rodney Mott and Matt Boland. All three served their country in the military; Richardson was a Navy man for 12 years, Mott for three years and Boland was in the Connecticut National Guard from 1987 through 1995.\n\nRichardson knows how lucky he is. If he was picked for that intramural team, he probably wouldn't have started officiating. If he hadn't started, he wouldn't be in the NBA.\n\n\"Everything was sort of preordained,\" Richardson said.\n\nMott feels the same way. He had a chance to accept a basketball scholarship in his hometown of Buffalo, New York, but decided to pursue a military career first. He went to San Diego State after leaving the Navy in 1979, got a degree in aeronautical engineering, landed a job at McDonnell Douglas and stayed in the game through a bit of coaching.\n\nSomeone approached him and said he'd make a good referee. Before long, Mott \u2014 who spent a lot of time in Southern California playing with NBA guys like Michael Cage and Randy Smith and eventual Baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn (who was an excellent point guard before turning his energy toward baseball) \u2014 was learning the ref trade in a camp run by then-NBA ref Hue Hollins.\n\n\"The rest is history,\" Mott said. \"I'm happy with the choice that I made. Very happy. Refereeing has been very good. It's kept me close to the game. I could play, but I'm a better referee than I was a player.\"\n\nRichardson and Mott have heard \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" countless times before games over the years.\n\nIt never gets old. To them, the anthem still resonates.\n\n\"It's special,\" Richardson said. \"I'm proud, not to be recognized but to have represented. When I hear that anthem, you realize that you were part of something that's held in reverence. I look around the arenas, there's a lot of times where they recognize all veterans and ask them to stand, and I'm proud to be standing as well.\"\n\nTHE TRADE\n\nJimmy Butler going to Philadelphia, a deal that becomes official on Monday, means the 76ers might have three All-Stars in the same season \u2014 something they haven't had in more than 30 years.\n\nButler, fellow returning All-Star Joel Embiid and probable All-Star Ben Simmons are expected to be headed to Charlotte this February for the league's midseason showcase. The last time Philly sent three to an All-Star Game was when Julius Erving, Charles Barkley and Maurice Cheeks went in 1987.\n\nA little bit has changed since then:\n\n\u2014 That game was in Seattle, which no longer is in the NBA.\n\n\u2014 The league had 23 teams, as opposed to the 30 it has now.\n\n\u2014 That was also the last season where every NBA team averaged at least 100 points per game. This season, the league is on pace for that to happen again.\n\nDONCIC WATCH\n\nIt's not fair to anoint someone rookie of the year less than a month into the season, though Dallas' Luka Doncic certainly looks the part.\n\nOnly three other rookies whose first NBA games came as teenagers \u2014 LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant \u2014 finished their debut seasons averaging at least 20 points. Doncic, the Mavericks' 19-year-old budding star, might have a shot to join that very exclusive club.\n\nSo far, he's averaging 20.3 points, along with 6.5 rebounds and 4.5 assists. The only three players who finished their rookie seasons with those averages in all three categories are Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Oscar Robertson.\n\n\"My opinion is that he doesn't have a limit,\" Mavs forward Maxi Kleber said. \"Luka can do whatever. You can already tell now because of the way he plays and how efficient he is. You can tell that he's a very special talent.\"\n\nDoncic is fully aware that he's already in top-rookie conversations. He's trying not to listen.\n\n\"Yeah, of course it would be special, but for me it's always for the team,\" Doncic said. \"Of course I want to enter the playoffs first. That's my goal, and later the individual stuff.\"\n\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\n\nSomething to watch for every day of this week ...\n\n\u2014 Magic at Wizards, Monday: Washington has way, way too much talent to be off to a 3-9 start.\n\n\u2014 Hornets at Cavaliers, Tuesday: Charlotte already has a 32-point win over Cleveland this season.\n\n\u2014 Pistons at Raptors, Wednesday: Toronto fans will do the right thing and warmly greet Dwane Casey.\n\n\u2014 Warriors at Rockets, Thursday: The clubs' first meeting since the 2018 Western Conference finals.\n\n\u2014 Kings at Grizzlies, Friday: Too early to know if either team is for real, but they've started off well.\n\n\u2014 Jazz at Celtics, Saturday: Gordon Hayward won't be subjected to boos during warmups in this one.\n\n\u2014 Lakers at Heat, Sunday: LeBron James makes his lone 2018-19 trip to Miami, where he won two titles.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Bills won 41-10. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTo say the Jets , Raiders and Bucs have quit would be hyperbole.\n\nTo say their fans are ready to quit watching them would be more accurate.\n\nThere was little to nothing worth mentioning about their performances Sunday in one-sided defeats. In the New York and Tampa Bay areas, much of the chatter will be about removing Todd Bowles and Dirk Koetter as head coaches of their respective outfits. At least Jon Gruden won't be worrying about job security with a Raiders team he has torn asunder, and he has the job security to rebuild.\n\nBowles got it right at the New Jersey Meadowlands by saying following a 41-10 embarrassment at the hands of the previously-inept-on-offense Buffalo: \"We stunk it up as coaches, we stunk it up as players.\"\n\nHis team certainly represented what used to be swamp land quite well Sunday.\n\nThe Jets (3-7, losers of four in a row) were blitzed from the beginning by a quarterback, Matt Barkley, who was unemployed a few days ago, and has been a journeyman for almost his entire NFL stint; this was his 12th game since 2013. They were overrun by LeSean McCoy, which is fine except when you consider he was in a horrendous slump and hadn't scored all season.\n\nWorst, they seemed apathetic and disinterested from the start, a strong indictment of the players and the coaches.\n\n\"They just came in and just straight, flat out, beat us,\" said Jets receiver Jermaine Kearse, who has had to adjust to lots of losing in New York after lots of winning while he was with the Seahawks. \"I wish I could give you an explanation. It's frustrating for all of us, but they just came in here and straight beat us.\"\n\nMaybe because the Bills were trying a whole lot harder?\n\n\"Nobody's quit on anybody,\" Kearse added. \"We win together, we lose together and that's everybody's mindset right now. We're all not perfect, we're out here trying to figure it out and find ways to improve this situation like anybody else. So, I would think that's far from the truth.\"\n\nThe Jets have never fired a coach during the season since the Johnson family bought the franchise in 2000. At least Bowles seems to have that going for him.\n\nKoetter is in his third season in charge in Tampa, and he's supposedly an offensive mastermind. Until being manhandled by Washington, the Bucs were tearing it up when they had the ball. Maybe somebody tore up all the play sheets that worked previously because they scored a mere three points against a team struggling with injuries.\n\nOffensive coordinator Todd Monken had been calling plays, but Koetter took over against the Redskins. He wouldn't explain why, but clearly it was a bogus decision.\n\n\"We weren't good enough as a team, and that starts with me,\" Koetter said. \"To move the ball like that and come up with three points, you're just not going to win that way.\"\n\nTampa (3-6) has the second-longest playoff drought, 10 seasons, and Koetter's chances of breaking that string are diminishing rapidly.\n\nNo such worries for Gruden, whose return to Oakland has been a fiasco so far. Give him credit for all the high draft picks the Raiders will have in April, and maybe for the high prospects they will carry into Las Vegas when they move in 2020.\n\nFor now, though, well \u2014 pardon us on this one \u2014 they've fallen into a Black Hole.\n\n\"This will be a year that a lot of us will never forget,\" Gruden said of his 1-8 team that has been outscored 75-9 in the past nine quarters in what has quickly become a lost season. \"It's painful. It's really hard. It's painful. It's going to be hard to sleep again, hard to get up in the morning.\"\n\nWhen Gruden gets up, he'll perhaps look at others to get rid of as he retools the roster already missing Khalil Mack, Bruce Irvin and Amari Cooper. He's got that wildly lucrative 10-year contract, virtual total control of personnel and no qualms about doing pretty much anything.\n\nWhat must hurt fans of these three teams that got hammered Sunday is that the effort from other losing clubs \u2014 Arizona, which tested powerful Kansas City; Cleveland, which stunned Atlanta; and, of course, Buffalo \u2014 was so strong, so admirable. Perhaps the worst sign for a struggling team is when it looks lost, lethargic and lacking skill on the field.\n\nIn New Jersey and the Tampa and Oakland bay areas, that's exactly what the fans saw in Week 10.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Bills won 41-10. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTime to start the \"Which coaches are on the way out?\" watch in the NFL, and all eyes are on Todd Bowles of the New York Jets at the moment.\n\nHow quickly it all fell apart for them.\n\nAfter going 10-6 in his first season there, the Jets are 13-29, a .310 winning percentage.\n\nHow soon could Bowles be gone? Consider that the Jets now head into a bye week. So that might make sense as a time to make a change for a club that had zero fight in it during a 41-10 loss Sunday against the visiting Buffalo Bills and quarterback Matt Barkley, of all people.\n\n\"We stunk it up as coaches,\" Bowles said. \"We stunk it up as players.\"\n\nAll true.\n\nHere's another comment that was rather telling: \"That's the first time I felt like somebody really smacked us,\" Jets cornerback Morris Claiborne said, \"and we didn't do nothing about it.\"\n\nKeep in mind that the Bills are nothing special. Barkley is worse than that \u2014 a has-been who never was, nearly two years removed from his most recent NFL start. But defensive guru Bowles couldn't come up with anything to stop the guy.\n\nNow the Jets are 3-7 and heading in the wrong direction, losers of four straight games.\n\nBowles shouldn't stand alone in terms of questions about how much longer he will \u2014 or should \u2014 last in his current job.\n\nAs embarrassing as the Jets suddenly are, Bowles is hardly the only coach whose club is looking unprepared and unable to compete lately:\n\n\u2014 Doug Marrone's Jacksonville Jaguars somehow immediately went from AFC runners-up to also-rans, dropping five consecutive games to fall to 3-6 after a 29-26 loss to the Indianapolis Colts;\n\n\u2014 Dirk Koetter's Tampa Bay Buccaneers somehow beat the New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles in Weeks 1 and 2 but have lost six of seven games since to sit at 3-6 after a 16-3 setback against the visiting Washington Redskins;\n\n\u2014 Jon Gruden is not going anywhere anytime soon, of course, but his Oakland Raiders are as bad as it gets right now, going to 1-8 after losing five games in a row by at least 14 points each, the latest a 20-6 defeat at home against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\"This will be a year that a lot of us will never forget,\" Gruden said. \"It's painful.\"\n\nJets fans probably feel the same way about their season.\n\nIn case you missed it, here are other top topics after the NFL season's 10th Sunday:\n\nROAD, SWEET ROAD\n\nWashington Redskins cornerback Josh Norman celebrated a road victory by blasting the NFC East leaders' home fans, saying it seems like they \"just don't really care; they just boo everything and aren't really behind us.\" Washington is 3-1 in away games, 3-2 at home. \"We can play all the games on the road, if you ask me,\" said Norman, who had an acrobatic interception early, one of four turnovers forced by Washington's defense against the Bucs. Later, Norman sent out a tweet encouraging spectators to be more supportive and enthusiastic at home. After all, with a 6-3 record, a two-game division lead over the surprisingly so-so Super Bowl champion Eagles and the Cowboys (both 4-5 after Dallas beat Philadelphia 27-20 with the help of a hurdle by Ezekiel Elliott) and an easy schedule the rest of the way, the Redskins would host a playoff game if they avoid a collapse.\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\n\nThis week's most original TD celebration \u2014 remember when the league tried to discourage all of those with penalties and fines? \u2014 came courtesy of Kansas City Chiefs speedster Tyreek Hill. After catching one of Patrick Mahomes' two TD passes in KC's 26-14 win over the Arizona Cardinals, Hill hopped into the stands and grabbed ahold of a TV camera, managing to record images of some teammates whooping it up, as well as the flag he earned for unsportsmanlike conduct. Chiefs coach Andy Reid was not exactly thrilled by that aspect of the charade. \"That was too much,\" Reid said. \"I'm all into the 'personality' thing, but he was ... out of character there.\"\n\nBETTER THAN OMAHA\n\nGive Los Angeles Rams QB Jared Goff credit for directing a potent offense that's helped his team get off to a 9-1 start. Give him credit, too, for quite an audible in LA's 36-31 victory against the Seattle Seahawks, name-checking Oscar winner Halle Berry.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dennis Waszak Jr. in East Rutherford, N.J., and Josh Dubow in Oakland, Calif., contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The organizations in charge of Olympic sports in the U.S. face complicated demands from everyone from elite athletes down to grassroots volunteers. They have limited resources and staffs that often can\u2019t handle many challenges. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that turnover is rampant in some of the highest-profile jobs. (AP Photo/Gero Breloer, file) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSoon after he accepted the thankless task of trying to rebuild the sprawling, fractured operation at USA Track and Field, Doug Logan received a one-line text from the NBA commissioner at the time, David Stern: \"You only take the easy ones.\"\n\nLogan laughed. Deep down, the former commissioner of Major League Soccer knew if he did what was necessary, he'd make enemies and be gone in a few years.\n\nHe lasted 26 months \u2014 not very surprising given the world of Olympic-style politics, infighting, limited resources and multilayered demands he walked into.\n\n\"There's the old cliche of 'low risk, high reward,'\" Logan said. \"Taking a job like that, it's 'high risk, low reward.'\"\n\nAs the new CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee, Sarah Hirshland, or any of the three recently ousted leaders of USA Gymnastics can attest to, the task of running an organization in the U.S. Olympic world looks like a job description from hell:\n\nWanted: Take-no-prisoners sports-and-business expert to run not-for-profit sports team in which you have no say in picking the players, and cannot pay them, either.\n\nSalary: $1 million a year if you're lucky.\n\nKey challenges: Ensure athlete safety, both from abusers and day-to-day injuries common to your sport. Keep hundreds of grassroots clubs, thousands of volunteers and hundreds of thousands of recreational participants happy.\n\nAlso: From those grassroots programs, maintain a high-functioning, elite program guaranteed to win medals each year at world championships and Olympics.\n\nBonus: Be ready, at any given moment, to answer to the government, which ultimately controls your future but has vowed not to spend a penny toward furthering your success.\n\nIf you succeed, you get to keep your job. For a while, at least.\n\nUltimately, neither the USA Gymnastics board of directors nor the two leaders it chose to reboot the federation were up to these tasks. That led Hirshland to call for the dismantling of the national governing body (NGB) torn apart by a sex-abuse scandal it couldn't prevent, recognize or rebuild from. Hirshland's own future will be decided in part by what the USOC does to replace the agency it seeks to tear apart.\n\nUSA Gymnastics is only one of 50 national governing bodies \u2014 all with differing sizes, agendas, budgets and staffs \u2014 but with this common thread:\n\n\"You have to not only look for ways to grow your sport, but also for ways to support your sport at the highest level,\" said Rich Bender, the CEO of USA Wrestling. \"At times, you can get conflicted. One of the realities is, those NGBs that have found success have been able to marry the two.\"\n\nWhen Congress adopted the Ted Stevens Amateur Sports Act in 1978, its main motivation was to wrest control of the individual sports from the grip of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), which regulated most Olympic sports and often adopted rules that didn't allow them to function well at the highest levels.\n\nThe law, likely to be revisited and tweaked in the wake of the sex-abuse scandal, established the modern-day USOC and gave it authority to choose which organizations would oversee the dozens of sports on the Olympic program.\n\nThose organizations, the annual revenues of which fall in the range of anywhere from $750,000 (USA Badminton) to $35 million (USA Track and Field, US Ski and Snowboard), are in control of much more than producing gold-medal Olympians, however.\n\n\"A lot of these NGBs have an executive, and he or she is doing press releases, folding towels and making sure they have a place to stay at the Olympics,\" said Bob Condron, a longtime Olympic insider who worked at the USOC. \"A lot don't have the resources to do what they're supposed to do.\"\n\nJim Scherr, the former CEO of the USOC, ticked off no fewer than a dozen roles a typical NGB has to fulfill.\n\nAmong them: managing youth sports; developing athlete pipelines; liaising with the NCAA, which is a key part of that pipeline in the United States; marketing, promoting and delivering local programs and services; event management, both local and national; fundraising; sponsorship; media; ticketing; licensing; managing hundreds of volunteers whose only compensation are recognition and occasional access to events.\n\nBoard members that oversee the staff and set the direction of the organization are volunteers \u2014 usually not well versed in most, if not all, of these areas.\n\n\"There's a cycle,\" Scherr said. \"Boards will focus for a while on athletic performance and hire someone who's an expert there. Then, they'll say, 'We've lost sight of the bottom line,' and the sports person will get replaced with someone they think can steward those resources. Then, that will get solidified and they'll want someone who can drive media rights.\n\n\"Then, eventually, the focus shifts back to sports.\"\n\nUntil, that is, the cycle is interrupted by an unexpected crisis, which is where USA Gymnastics and, to some extent, the USOC, now find themselves.\n\nSex abuse has, for now, replaced doping as the crisis that most Olympic organizations were not built to deal with. As the dig-out begins, Hirshland will have to find a leader for gymnastics who, first and foremost, understands the need to shift the focus to athlete safety \u2014 with some concrete actions to put behind the words. It is, even in this fraught time, not an area of expertise for most sports executives.\n\nThe last time this big an NGB was in this sort of peril came when Logan was hired, not long after the USOC threatened to cut off funding or decertify a federation it deemed to be poorly run by an unwieldy board of directors.\n\nLogan cleaned house and tried to get a grip on a volunteer operation that many felt had gotten out of control. He also created a panel to assess why the team won a paltry 23 medals in track and field at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nIn the end, he was gone, and replaced by Max Siegel, a marketing veteran with NASCAR ties who has received equal doses of love and hate for his signature business accomplishment while at the helm \u2014 a 23-year extension on the sponsorship deal with Nike worth more than $450 million.\n\nThe U.S. team has won 29 (2012) and 32 (2016) Olympic medals under his watch.\n\nBut he has no illusions that these jobs are easy \u2014 or forever.\n\n\"When people approach it by saying, 'It's a (not-for-profit),' the implication is that it's a charitable organization,\" Siegel said. \"But that's not the case, and running a public entity that has commercial objectives are not missions that go hand-in-hand. It's a constant challenge and it is a built-in tension.\"\n\nSiegel, now in his seventh year at the helm of one of the toughest NGBs out there, is a rare exception.\n\nThe chilling fact is that almost everyone who has tried one of these jobs since the current framework was established in the 1970s has been shown the door \u2014 often in far less than seven years. Scherr said the USOC conducted a survey while he was CEO and found that, excluding a few outliers, the average tenure of an NGB executive was around 18 months.\n\n\"It takes a particular lunatic, like me, to be incented to do them,\" Logan said. \"But the thing that is exciting about them is the great challenge.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Ezekiel Elliott took one giant leap that may have saved Dallas' season.\n\nBut it was Elliott's go-ahead 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter that helped the Cowboys finally hurdle the Super Bowl champs.\n\nThe Cowboys showed a second-half spark \u2014 and cooled the hot seat for coach Jason Garrett a few degrees \u2014 in a 27-20 win over the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones burst into the locker room and channeled his inner Ric Flair with a \"Wooo!\" that perked up the winners. Jones hit the locker room like a politician stumping for votes, shaking hands with anyone within reach.\n\n\"Now that was a win, I'll tell you right now,\" he said to a small circle of Cowboys.\n\nThe Cowboys are just 4-5 but the victory steadied a franchise that saw Garrett again under fire and Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman call for major organizational changes for a franchise far removed from the Super Bowl heyday.\n\nElliott and Dak Prescott quieted the doubters after a dazzling Sunday that put the champion Eagles' season on the rocks.\n\n\"You can imagine the way Jason Garrett, his resolve before the game,\" Jones said. \"I asked him before the game, 'You feeling any pressure?' (Garrett replied) 'It just makes me want to go out and do more to turn this thing.'\"\n\nElliott made highlight reels and kept the Dallas' NFC East title hopes alive when he extended a play in the first half. The Cowboys tried a fake punt on fourth-and-2 from their 31 and Jeff Heath took a direct snap and ran three yards. A few plays later, Elliott hurdled Tre Sullivan on a 32-yard run to the Eagles 8. Michael Bennett sacked Prescott on third down and Brett Maher kicked a 31-yard field goal for a 6-0 lead.\n\nWas it Elliott's best bound over a defender?\n\n\"I'll leave that up to you guys to decide,\" Elliott said.\n\nJones was positive it was Elliott's finest.\n\n\"We've seen him make that move before,\" Jones said. \"But I don't know when I've ever seen him totally clear it.\"\n\nWhile the Super Bowl champions are reeling, the Cowboys didn't exactly look a serious threat to the NFC East crown. Prescott had 270 yards passing, tossed for one touchdown and also ran for a score. Elliott also had a TD reception , against an Eagles secondary depleted by injury.\n\nThe Cowboys will need a win at Atlanta (4-5) next week and then a win Nov. 22 against division-leading Washington to really establish themselves as a playoff contender. It's a leap of faith larger than anything attempted by Elliott that the Cowboys can wrest their way into the NFC playoff picture.\n\nBut for a night, it was enough.\n\n\"We had no choice but to win,\" said Elliott, who cupped his hand to his ear as he walked off the field to boos.\n\nGarrett, who has yet to lead Dallas to even an NFC title game, knew the magnitude of the rivalry game.\n\n\"We were in a challenging situation,\" he said. \"We had to come up here and win a football game.\"\n\nBoth teams felt the pressure even before former President George W. Bush performed the coin toss . The Cowboys and Eagles got into a small pregame scuffle that ended on the sideline before players were ushered back into the tunnel.\n\nDallas took a 10-3 lead into the half before Elliott and Prescott got rolling. Elliott ran in from the 1 to give Dallas a 27-20 lead after Prescott completed passes of 24 yards to Amari Cooper and 23 yards to Allen Hurns on the drive.\n\nIt was the kind of drive that might have impressed Aikman. Aikman, who won three Super Bowls with the Cowboys, said this week \"there has to be a complete overhaul of the entire organization .\"\n\nThe Cowboys just shrugged it off as just another controversy that didn't concern them.\n\n\"We're Dallas Cowboys. You guys love to talk about us, you guys love to make stories,\" Elliott said. \"We're used to ignoring all the extra stuff and focusing on us.\"\n\nEagles fans were spotted transporting a Cowboys coffin into Lincoln Financial Field , perhaps as a symbol of some sort of burial of Dallas' season.\n\nDon't hold those last playoff rites for the Cowboys just yet.\n\n\"When you're feeling low and you see the Grim Reaper,\" Jones said, \"and then you come in and have your team perform the way these guys did, I promise you, it is a special feeling.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Tyson Chandler had quite a week with the Lakers.\n\nPlucked from last-place Phoenix, Chandler played a key defensive role in his first three games with his new team, helping them win three straight for the first time this season.\n\nLeBron James dunked for the winning basket with 15 seconds to go and Chandler blocked Trae Young's driving layup to preserve a 107-106 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday night.\n\nJames shouted and hugged Chandler in celebration of the Lakers' fifth win in six games.\n\n\"I find myself acting like a kid in a candy store again,\" said Chandler, who couldn't hear James amid the din of music and cheering.\n\n\"I said, 'That's my dawg,'\" James yelled across the Lakers' locker room.\n\nChandler's defense helped the Lakers prevail in wins against Minnesota and at Sacramento after having his contract bought out and coming to Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\n\"He's been big,\" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. \"Not only the way he is on court but the way he talks in the huddles.

Whoever coined that years ago was right on,\" Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. \"Who knew he'd still be able to impact games at 41 years old?\"\n\nJames got fouled at the other end and missed both.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Real Betis coach Quique Setien likes to say that he would give his little finger to have had the honor of playing for Johan Cruyff.\n\nThat didn't stop him for masterminding a 4-3 victory Sunday at Barcelona, a team that claims Cruyff as the creator of its playing style.\n\n\"This is a game to put in a frame,\" Setien said. \"To win here and score four goals is something that will be remembered always. Anybody who likes football and cares about more than just getting a result will have liked this match.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old Setien is a former Spain midfielder who is trying to make Betis not just a winner, but a proponent of the beautiful game.\n\nSince arriving at Betis at the start of the 2017-18 season, Setien has installed a three-man defense, a formation that Cruyff used to great success when he coached Barcelona to the club's first European Cup in 1992 and four consecutive Spanish league titles from 1991-94.\n\nThe formation\u2014 and Betis' aggressive attitude\u2014 proved key to dealing Barcelona its first home loss in la Liga in over two years.\n\n\"Barcelona has been setting the standard for 20 to 25 years and we are trying to establish our identity,\" Setien said. \"Barcelona's fans have been watching this kind of football for many years, while we are still apprentices.\n\n\"I am thrilled with our match today. It is a huge boost to what we are doing because there are some people who don't believe in this way of playing.\"\n\nBetis fans had good reason to question Setien's methods after a sixth-place finish last campaign.\n\nThe Sevilla-based club had very little to show from its open, flowing passing game.\n\nA squad packed with playmakers such as Joaquin Sanchez, Sergio Canales and Takashi Inui, lacked quality strikers. Before the visit to Barcelona, Betis was the lowest-scoring team in the league along with Valencia after just notching eight goals in 11 matches.\n\nThree of those previous goals were scored in a 3-3 draw at Celta Vigo in the prior round, and more goals came at Camp Nou.\n\nBesides his appreciation of Cruyff's tactics, Setien also credits his love for chess with helping his understanding of soccer. Setien says one of his highlights as a chess player was his participation in simultaneous exhibitions against chess legends Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov.\n\nChess, he says, taught him \"patience, capacity for analysis, emotional control.\"\n\n\"And perspective. It's not about where the pieces are now, but where they will be after a series of moves,\" Setien told Spanish newspaper El Periodico recently.\n\nSetien's use of five players in midfield allowed Betis to pressure high up the pitch and mount quick attacks in large numbers.\n\nLeft wing back Junio Firpo scored the opener after being sprung by a perfectly-weighted pass from William Carvalho.\n\nThe two combined to start another attack that finished with six Betis attackers against four defenders and Sanchez making it 2-0 before halftime.\n\n\"We were a brave team, we played a great game,\" Sanchez said. \"We showed the finish touch we were missing in other matches.\"\n\nBarcelona manager Ernesto Valverde sacrificed the passing and ball-control provided by Arthur for the punch of Arturo Vidal at halftime.\n\nThe result was Barcelona scoring all three of its goals, including two by Lionel Messi and one by Vidal. But Betis also scored twice after halftime when Giovani Lo Celso was left unmarked arriving from midfield before Firpo set up Canales to take the goal that proved to be the winner.\n\n\"In the trading of blows we couldn't control the situation,\" Valverde said. \"Each time we got closer they hit us right back.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Daniel Royer scored twice in a 2:44 span late in the second half, and the New York Red Bulls advanced to Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference finals with a 3-0 win over Columbus on Sunday night that overturned a first-leg deficit and likely will free the U.S. Soccer Federation to hire Crew coach Gregg Berhalter to run the American national team.\n\nNew York won the two-leg playoff on 3-1 aggregate and will play Atlanta United in a two-leg semifinal on Nov. 25 and 29.

The Empires Supporters Club behind the goal set off red flares, and there was still smoke over the field when Alejandro Romero Gamarra fed Royer off a counter in the 76th.\n\nWith Red Bull Arena just two-thirds full on a night with a kickoff temperature in the low 40s, New York evened the aggregate after Sean Davis sent a free kick from 35 yards on the right flank into the penalty area. Royer headed the ball down and defender Aaron Long kicked it toward goalkeeper Zack Steffen from 7 yards.

Ertz lateraled to Golden Tate but he was tackled for no gain to end it.\n\n\"We just didn't execute,\" said Wentz, who finished 32 of 44 for 360 yards with one interception. \"We all got to look in the mirror and ask what can we do better.\"\n\nIt was a defensive battle into the third quarter before the offenses went back-and-forth.\n\nElliott ran in from the 1 to give Dallas a 27-20 lead after Prescott completed passes of 24 yards to Amari Cooper and 23 yards to Allen Hurns on the drive.\n\nComing off a bye, the Eagles were listless in the first half and trailed 13-3 before rallying to tie it on Wentz's 15-yard TD pass to Ertz late in the third quarter. Wentz connected with Jordan Matthews for 18 yards on third-and-11 to extend the drive. He hit him again for 12 yards on the next play and found Ertz a few plays later.\n\nPrescott tossed a 7-yard TD pass to Elliott to give Dallas a 20-13 lead on the ensuing possession. Elliott accounted for 57 of the 75 yards on the drive.\n\nBut the Eagles answered. Wentz hit Nelson Agholor, who made an excellent catch for a 51-yard gain to the Cowboys 8. Wentz found Ertz in the back of the end zone for a 1-yard TD pass to tie it at 20-20.\n\nPrescott engineered a 75-yard drive in the final 90 seconds of the first half to send the Eagles into the locker room to a chorus of boos from a frustrated crowd.\n\nMichael Gallup turned a screen pass on third-and-15 at the Cowboys 35 into a 25-yard gain. Prescott connected with Cole Beasley for 21 yards and hit Hurns for 17 yards to the Eagles 1. Prescott then sneaked in for the score.\n\nAfter hearing it from their fans, the Eagles came out with a stop on defense and the offense drove to the Cowboys 11 before having to settle for Jake Elliott's 26-yard field goal.\n\nTRICKY\n\nThe Cowboys tried a fake punt on fourth-and-2 from their 31 and Jeff Heath took a direct snap and ran three yards. A few plays later, Elliott hurdled Tre Sullivan on a 32-yard run to the Eagles 8. But Michael Bennett sacked Prescott on third down and Brett Maher kicked a 31-yard field goal for a 6-0 lead.\n\nGOLDEN'S DEBUT\n\nTate, acquired by the Eagles from Detroit on Oct. 30, had only two catches for 19 yards.\n\nINJURIES\n\nEagles: CB Ronald Darby left the game after injuring his knee in the second half.

Trysta Krick breaks down the biggest storylines from the weekend's action. USA TODAY\n\nDallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott (21) leaps over the tackle attempt of Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Tre Sullivan (37) during the second quarter at Lincoln Financial Field. (Photo: Bill Streicher, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 You knew it would take something special for the beleaguered Dallas Cowboys to come into the Linc on Sunday night and hang one on the defending Super Bowl champs.\n\nSomething like Ezekiel Elliott hurdling a defender in the open field.\n\nElliott\u2019s big night in the 27-20 victory included two fourth-quarter touchdowns, 151 rushing yards and an open-field hurdle of Tre Sullivan on a 32-yard run in the second quarter that left him streaking straight to the end zone ... until he tripped eight yards shy of the goal line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural,\u201d Elliott said of his hurdle, which punctuated a 14-play, 8-minute drive that also included a conversion on a fake field goal. \u201cI just feel it. I just wish I didn\u2019t get tackled by the turf monster at the end. I guess I didn\u2019t want to be great.\u201d\n\nHow modest. Elliott was more than great in shredding the NFL\u2019s No. 2 run defense to the tune of 7.9 yards per carry. After declaring in the days leading up to the game that the Cowboys needed to get its rushing game in gear following a deflating home loss to the Titans, Elliott led by example.\n\nIn addition to his 19 rushes, he tied for the team high with six catches for 36 yards.\n\nThis all complemented a clutch Dallas defense that sealed the victory by stopping Philadelphia (4-5) on two last-gasp drives in the final three minutes.\n\nElliott knows. The Cowboys (4-5) saved their season.\n\n\u201cWe needed it,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cIt was actually mandatory that we won, to keep our hopes up.\u201d\n\nDallas led 13-3 at the half, then withstood one Eagles rally after another. Philadelphia tied the game at 13 late in the third quarter on the first of two TD receptions from tight end Zach Ertz, who burned the Cowboys for 14 catches and 145 yards.\n\nThe Cowboys responded to both of Ertz\u2019s scores with 75-yard drive capped by TDs from Elliott \u2014 a 7-yard reception from Dak Prescott followed by a 1-yard plunge with 3:19 that held up as the game-winner.\n\nAs big of a win as it was for Dallas, it was another deflating blow for the Eagles, unable to recapture the rhythm that carried them to a Super Bowl crown. Philadelphia hasn\u2019t won consecutive games all season and as reminded by the boos, has dropped three consecutive games at home.\n\n\u201cI know they needed it,\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said, \u201cbut nobody needed it more than us.\u201d\n\nThree other things we learned:\n\n1. Jason Garrett feels the heat: Before the game, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had a pointed question for his battered coach: \u201cIs this enough pressure?\u201d Jones said he was only half-kidding. Garrett responded that with the flood of criticism and hot-seat rumblings, he\u2019s even more resolved. Then he went out and coached with such urgency. In the second quarter, Garrett called for a fake punt on fourth-and-two from his own 31-yard line and the risky move worked with a snap to up-back Jeff Heath. It kept alive a 14-play field goal drive that helped set an aggressive tone.\n\n2. Leighton Vander Esch performed like a star in the making: The first-round linebacker from Boise State, pressed into the starting lineup because of the hamstring injury that sidelined Sean Lee, turned in a series of big plays that illustrated what the Cowboys hoped for when they invested such a high pick on a prospect that some considered a reach. His first-quarter interception and 28-yard return set up the game\u2019s first score. And he helped close out the win by dropping Corey Clement for a 5-yard loss on a screen pass on third-and-two from the Dallas 30 \u2014 he snuffed out the play on a hunch, he insisted \u2014 just after the two-minute warning. In between, he made an outstanding goal-line stop of Nelson Agholor to thwart a jet sweep. Oh, and he finished with a game-high 13 tackles \u2014 all solo stops. It used to be that the Dallas defense was deflated when playing without the oft-injured Lee in the lineup. That isn\u2019t the case now, given the boost from young linebackers like Jaylon Smith and Vander Esch, whose confidence is steadily increasing.\n\n3. Digging for Gold(en): Needing a boost for a sagging offense, the Eagles had definite designs to quickly integrate Golden Tate into the flow. He caught Carson Wentz\u2019s first pass on a hitch. Then Wentz twice threw for Tate on crucial third downs that fell incomplete \u2014 a red-zone play in the first half and a deep throw early in the second half, forced against tight coverage. Then Tate, obtained from Detroit just before the trade deadline, was on the receiving end of a hook-and-ladder lateral from Zach Ertz that was good for 11 yards and helped set up a field goal. Tate, by no means, had the type of eye-popping game he\u2019s had before against the Cowboys \u2014 Ertz, Nelson Agholor and Jordan Matthews had the big plays \u2014 but the manner in which he was used demonstrated just how much of a factor he can be as the Eagles try to mount a playoff push down the stretch. And with Darren Sproles yet to return, Tate supplanted Corey Clement as the punt returner.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

(Photo: Jay Calderon, The Desert Sun-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Residents gathered for a community meeting Sunday night in Woodland Hills shouted for answers about the status of their homes and wanted to know when they could return to them.\n\nA crowd of about 250 people asked \u2013 and sometimes interrupted \u2013 public officials at Taft High School, an evacuation center filled by those who have fled the Woolsey and Hill fires in Southern California that have collectively burned nearly 90,000 acres since Thursday, according to Cal Fire.\n\nAltogether, about 250,000 in the area were displaced at the time of the meeting, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Department Chief John Benedict. Residents expressed concerns about timelines for repopulation, rebuilding permits and independent pollution investigations, as well as frustrations about how officials allegedly did not communicate evacuation orders in some areas.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire, affecting Thousand Oaks, Oak Park, Westlake Village, Agoura Hills, West Hills, Simi Valley, Chatsworth, Bell Canyon, Hidden Hills, Malibu and Calabasas, was 15 percent contained and had torched 85,200 acres as of 8 p.m. PST Sunday.\n\nThe fire has claimed two lives, both adults, officials said Sunday night. Their bodies were found in unincorporated Malibu, where their vehicle was overcome by fire.\n\nThe Hill Fire, meanwhile, was 75 percent contained and had scorched 4,531 acres north of Malibu and south of Simi Valley, Cal Fire reported Sunday night.\n\nLocal state Sen. Henry Stern moderated the session, which included officials from Cal Fire, the California Highway Patrol, Los Angeles and Ventura County sheriff departments, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Department of Toxic Substances Control and emergency services.\n\nOfficials did not have many immediate answers, explaining that local governments will make decisions depending on conditions. A highway patrol official noted plans to reopen portions of Highway 101, one of the region's primary roadways.\n\nA disaster declaration requested by Gov. Jerry Brown was still pending Sunday night, according to FEMA.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that extremely critical fire weather conditions would persist through Tuesday, likely causing rapid fire growth, extreme fire behavior and long-range spotting with existing fires and any new ignitions.\n\nBell Canyon resident Randy Piotroski, 60, evacuated his home of 15 years at 11:15 p.m. Thursday.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Seattle coach Pete Carroll had every reason to be frustrated after his Seahawks dropped a second straight game in the final minute.\n\nHowever, Carroll wasn't sounding the alarm on his team's season after a 36-31 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.\n\n\"We aren't slowing down. We're going to keep running the football, keep setting the tempo,\" Carroll said. \"I love the way we're playing. We just have to stay alive and keep going.\"\n\nThe success of the Seahawks' running game is what has Carroll confident about his team's hopes of contending for a playoff spot. Seattle (5-6) ran for 273 yards \u2014 the eighth most in a single game in franchise history \u2014 despite Chris Carson missing the game due to a hip injury. Rashaad Penny, who was selected in the first round of last April's draft, had his first 100-yard game as a pro with 108 yards on 12 carries.\n\nPenny missed most of training camp due to a broken finger before slowly working his way back into the rotation once he improved in the pass game and on pass blocking.\n\n\"I feel like I've grown up the last two to three weeks,\" Penny said. \"I told myself the whole game that I can do this and the coaches trust me.\"\n\nRussell Wilson, who was 17 of 26 for 176 yards and three touchdowns, had just 11 pass attempts going into the fourth quarter. That was the lowest number of pass attempts through three quarters in his seven-year career.\n\nA turnover by Wilson has loomed large in both of Seattle's recent losses. Last Sunday against the Chargers, he threw an interception in the fourth quarter that was returned for a touchdown. This week, he fumbled the ball on a strip sack by Rams linebacker Dante Fowler that was recovered at the Seahawks' nine yard line with less than six minutes remaining. One play later, Brandon Cooks scored on a nine-yard run to give Los Angeles a 36-24 lead.\n\nSeattle scored on its ensuing possession and got the ball back after holding the Rams to a three-and-out. Wilson got Seattle to the Rams 36 yard line with 39 seconds remaining, but three straight incompletions ended any hopes of a comeback.\n\nThe Seahawks haven't been able to force a turnover in either loss, which has frustrated the defense.\n\n\"We just needed one tip ball or on the ground to flip the script and we didn't come up with it,\" defensive end Dion Jordan said. \"We played these good teams hard twice and didn't come up with the win. Pete doesn't want us to get down on ourselves. This has to be turning point for us going into these last couple games.\"\n\nSeattle's decision to call a surprise onside kick down 26-24 with under 10 minutes remaining ended up costing them. Carroll said Sebastian Janikowski hit the ball wrong, which led to an easy recovery by Rams wide receiver Josh Reynolds. The short field ended up leading to a 20-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein.\n\n\"Before that play, actually, I see them talking to the ref and kind of pointing in that area. Something's a little up. And then I saw his approach,\" Reynolds said. \"I used to be a kicker in high school, so I saw his approach change right when he was about to kick the ball, so I knew what it was.\"\n\nThe Seahawks have five of their final seven games at home, but it is not an easy stretch drive. It starts on Thursday night against Green Bay and also includes a game at Carolina (Nov. 25) and home games against Minnesota (Dec. 10) and Kansas City (Dec. 23).\n\n\"We feel like we are a lot better than our record shows,\" linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \"We had some plays get away from us and we lost some games. There's still a lot of football left. We're confident that we'll pull it out.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But the Magic shook off a bizarre and restless night to thump the Knicks, even thriving with Gordon on the bench because of a sprained left ankle.\n\nHarlem native Mo Bamba played his first NBA game at Madison Square Garden and had 15 points and eight rebounds. Evan Fournier added 12 points for the Magic, who have won two straight and four of five.\n\nThe Magic made a season-high 17 3-pointers off 42 attempts.\n\n\"Coach (Pat) Riley always says it's a make or miss league, and the night where you shoot the ball like that, everything else is going to go your way,\" Orlando coach Steve Clifford said.\n\nOrlando reeled off 10 straight points to start the game, capped by Vucevic's turnaround jumper that led the Knicks to call a timeout with 7:27 left in the first quarter.\n\nEnes Kanter notched his fifth straight double-double with 16 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nHe put New York on the board with a tip-in layup, ending a string of eight straight misses to make it 10-2, but it was just too late.\n\nNew York hit just 5 of 23 from the field in the opening period and missed each of their seven 3-point attempts.\n\n\"We always seem to have a quarter where nothing's clicking for us. We didn't see the ball go in,\" Knicks coach David Fizdale said.\n\nThe Magic closed the first quarter out on a 20-8 run, highlighted by Jerian Grant's 3 with 0.7 seconds left to lead 30-10.\n\nOrlando never looked back, leading by 34 points during the fourth quarter.\n\nKevin Knox had 17 points for the Knicks, who've lost two straight and four of five.\n\nMitchell Robinson set a Knicks rookie record with nine blocks, two below the franchise record.\n\n\"I can thank coach. He put me in a position to get those blocks,\" Robinson said.\n\nNew York was held to 33 percent from the field and made just 4 of 27 from deep.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nMagic: Gordon got injured in the second half of Friday night's victory over Washington. Jerrell Martin started at power forward in his place. ... Orlando's previous high mark behind the 3-point line was 16, Oct. 20 at Philadelphia. ...

They continue their stranglehold over the AFC West division, though the two loss Chargers are breathing down their necks. They entered Week 10 as the No. 1 seed in the AFC and ended it in the same spot. With New England dropping a game to the Titans, they have 1.5 game lead over the Patriots for the No. 1 seed.\n\nIf the playoffs started tomorrow, here\u2019s what the AFC playoff seeding would look like:\n\n1. Chiefs (9-1)\n\n2. Steelers (6-2-1)\n\n3. Patriots (7-3)\n\n4. Texans (6-3)\n\n5. Chargers (7-2)\n\n6. Bengals (5-4)\n\nThe Chiefs have certainly some challenges ahead, but taking care of business today matters in the long run.\n\nHomefield advantage\n\nHomefield advantage is extremely important to the Chiefs when it comes to the playoffs. Look no further than the Chiefs\u2019 defensive splits on the season. Of the Chiefs\u2019 31 total sacks 21 of them have come at home. The Chiefs have 11 interceptions on the season and 8 of those have come when the Chiefs have played at home. The defensive secondary has amassed 40 passes defended on the season and 28 of those have come in the confines of Arrowhead stadium.\n\nThe Chiefs\u2019 defense comes alive in front of the home crowd and struggles on the road. That can leave the offense exposed when they play against some of the better teams in the NFL outside of their home stadium. If they want to make a long push throughout the playoffs they\u2019ll need to maintain homefield advantage throughout.\n\nThe Chiefs have six games remaining in the regular season. Three games will be at home, one at a neutral site on the road, and two on the road in opponent stadiums. Only two of those six opponents have a winning record. Those teams are the Rams and the Chargers. The Chiefs could hypothetically win out. They could even afford to drop a game to any team not named the Chargers.\n\nOffensive line struggles\n\nThe Cardinals held the Chiefs to their lowest point total of the season with 26 points scored on the day. Against a talented Cardinals defensive line it seems that injuries along the Chiefs offensive line finally caught up to them. They struggled to get push in the run game and Eric Fisher put up one of his worst performances in his Chiefs career against Chandler Jones. At the end of the day they allowed five sacks and seven quarterback hits on Patrick Mahomes. The last thing this team can do is afford breakdowns along the offensive line.\n\nMore help on the way?\n\nThe Chiefs got some defensive help back in Week 10. Justin Houston and Daniel Sorensen played and their impact on the field was felt. It sounds like the Chiefs could be getting both offensive and defensive help as soon as Week 11.\n\nEric Berry hasn\u2019t played let alone practiced for the Chiefs in some time, could this be the week that he returns to action for the Chiefs? There is some optimism that Berry could at least be able to practice and see how his injury responds ahead of the game against the Rams.\n\nOn the offensive side of the ball, Mitch Morse has been out for four weeks with a concussion. Every concussion is unique and presents it\u2019s own timetable, symptoms, and challenges to overcome. He\u2019s had a few concussions now in his Chiefs career and the more concussions you have the more difficult they can be to overcome. If Morse misses another week it\u2019d speak to the severity of his concussion. It\u2019s also possible that he passes the concussion protocol and returns to action against the Rams in Week 11.\n\nSammy Watkins was kept out of the game against the Cardinals. He should be fresh and ready to go against the Los Angeles Rams as the Chiefs head to Mexico City.", "Green Bay Packers' Kyler Fackrell sacks Miami Dolphins' Brock Osweiler during the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Green Bay, Wis. (AP Photo/Matt Ludtke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 The injury-riddled Miami Dolphins still managed to generate plenty of scoring opportunities against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nBut they couldn't get into the end zone, and settling for field goals wasn't going to cut it against Aaron Rodgers.\n\nJason Sanders tied a Dolphins franchise rookie record with four field goals, but Miami (5-5) wasted good field position and squandered the game-opening drive after Brock Osweiler fumbled away a shotgun snap in a 31-12 loss at Lambeau Field on Sunday.\n\n\"Those type of things, you can't do against this guy (Rodgers). You do that, it's just a matter of time before he makes it right,\" Dolphins coach Adam Gase said.\n\nOsweiler, making his fifth straight start for the injured Ryan Tannehill, was 23 of 37 for 213 yards. He got sacked six times, including three straight plays late in the game. And he accounted for another turnover after throwing an interception to Bashaud Breeland that was returned 26 yards to the Miami 12 with 8:52 left in the third quarter.\n\nThe Packers cashed in on that turnover too, with Rodgers hitting Davante Adams for a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 16-point lead three plays later.\n\n\"I'm the only guy on the team that touches the ball every play on offense, and I need to find ways to be better and to score touchdowns,\" Osweiler said.\n\nThe offense was undermanned, though.\n\nStarting tackles Laremy Tunsil (knee, ankle) and Ja'Wuan James (knee), along with starting guard Ted Larsen (neck), were inactive. For a while, the Dolphins still moved the ball effectively, especially early in the game.\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake had a knee injury in the second quarter. Receivers Davante Parker (shoulder) and Jakeem Grant (leg) got hurt in the third.\n\nThe offense just stalled in Packers territory.\n\n\"Kicking field goals ain't going to beat the Packers. We have to execute better in the red zone,\" guard Jesse Davis said.\n\nMiami started one drive at midfield after recovering Tramon Williams' fumbled punt return. Another started at the 45 after the defense stopped Green Bay on fourth-and-2.\n\nA blocked punt in the third quarter gave the Dolphins the ball at the Packers' 28.\n\nEach time, Miami turned its advantageous field position into a field goal.\n\n\"I don't care who's on the field. Every time we touch the ball as an offensive unit, every series I expect to score a touchdown,\" Osweiler said.\n\n\"Is that going to be possible? Probably not. But that's our expectation as an offense. You know like I said, the blame is on nobody but myself. I need to be better,\" he added.\n\nBut he may not have a chance to prove he can do it.\n\nGase and Tannehill hope the starting quarterback can return after the upcoming bye week to play at Indianapolis on Nov. 25.\n\nOsweiler said that decision is out of his hands.\n\n\"But I'm going to focus on the things I can control and that's finding a way to get better as an individual, as a quarterback,\" he said. \"And then how I can help this offense if my number's called against the Colts.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrowns rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield has thrown multiple touchdown passes in each of his last four games. (Photo: Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSometimes a midseason coaching change can have an immediate impact on how players perform.\n\nThat sure seems to be the case in Cleveland.\n\nIn the two weeks since the Browns fired their head coach and offensive coordinator, quarterback Baker Mayfield has taken his game to a new level.\n\nIn his best performance as a pro, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft completed 17-of-20 passes for 216 yards and three touchdowns on Sunday (and also rushed for 20 more yards on six carries). But what really made the Browns offense go was another rookie, Nick Chubb.\n\nChubb led all running backs in Week 10 with 176 rushing yards, including a record-setting 92-yard touchdown jaunt.\n\nNick Chubb is GONE.\n\n\n\nThe Browns rookie RB races 92 yards for a TD, the longest run in franchise history. (Via @NFL) pic.twitter.com/2Cw5R1gQ1q \u2014 USA TODAY NFL (@usatodaynfl) November 11, 2018\n\nChubb also caught all three of his targets from Mayfield for 33 yards and another touchdown.\n\nThe only problem with the Browns offense playing so well is an inability to keep the momentum going next week \u2013 because they're on bye.\n\nFeeling #free\n\nAnother player who's playing the best he has all season is Green Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones.\n\nThe second-year pro entered Week 10 averaging 6.0 yards per carry, but his workload has seemed much lighter than his stats warranted. That's prompted a #FreeAaronJones movement among fantasy owners.\n\nThe campaign may have finally reached Packers coach Mike McCarthy. Jones had a huge game against the Miami Dolphins with 145 yards and a pair of touchdowns on a season-high 15 carries. He also caught three passes for 27 yards in his most extensive usage of the season.\n\nComing back strong\n\nIn general, it's not a great idea to rely on players the week they return from injury. However, fantasy owners who took a risk and had Leonard Fournette or Allen Robinson active were richly rewarded.\n\nFournette took the field for the first time since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 4. He carried 24 times for 53 yards and caught all five of his targets for 56 more. Although he didn't gobble up yardage in big chunks, the Jacksonville Jaguars running back did find the end zone once as a rusher and once as a receiver.\n\nMeanwhile, Robinson missed two games with a groin injury, but gave the Chicago Bears a big-play threat in his return. He caught six passes for 133 yards and two scores.\n\nBoth players should be every-week starts going forward. As long as they can remain healthy.\n\nOwn those mistakes\n\nSunday's game with the highest over/under projection was the matchup between the New Orleans Saints and Cincinnati Bengals \u2013 the teams giving up the most and second-most passing yards per game.\n\nIt seemed like a perfect situation for both quarterbacks. Even if the Saints dominated, the Bengals would at least have to throw often in an effort to catch up. It seemed reasonable Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton and wide receiver Tyler Boyd would hook up frequently, especially with star wideout A.J. Green sidelined.\n\nBrees (22-for-25, 265 yards, 3 TD) and the Saints (51 points) held up their end of the bargain, but Dalton threw for just 153 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. And Boyd caught just three passes for 65 yards, making fantasy advice to start both look extremely foolish.\n\nAnother phrase you'll never hear from me again: \"I really like Andy Dalton's matchup this week.\" \u2014 Steve Gardner (@SteveAGardner) November 11, 2018\n\nBroad Shoulders Award\n\nOur weekly honor for the player who single-handedly carried his fantasy owners to victory goes to another individual who has thrived following a coaching change.\n\nThe elevation of Byron Leftwich to Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator has coincided with more touches each week for running back David Johnson.\n\nJohnson rolled up 183 total yards (21 rushes, seven receptions) and scored a pair of touchdowns for a sizzling 37.3 fantasy points (PPR scoring) to lead all players in Week 10.\n\nHonorable mention: The award for efficiency goes to Indianapolis Colts tight end Eric Ebron. The big guy caught all three of the passes thrown his way for 69 yards and two touchdowns. Plus, he had a red-zone rush that he carried into the end zone for a 2-yard score. Four touches, three TDs.\n\nEarly waiver wire\n\nFantasy owners are constantly searching for the next big thing, but sometimes the best pickups can be players who were tossed aside earlier in the season.\n\nOne example is Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry. Although he's lost his No. 1 back status to Dion Lewis and his yardage totals haven't been great, Henry has now scored a touchdown in each of his last three games. He rushed for a season-high 58 yards against the New England Patriots and found the end zone twice.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks appeared to sour on first-round draft pick Rashaad Penny as he sank to No. 3 on the depth chart. With starting running back Chris Carson inactive, Penny turned a career-high 12 carries into 108 yards and a touchdown. Although backfield mate Mike Davis had a receiving touchdown, Penny looked much more explosive.\n\nWhile the Bears got a big game from Robinson in his return, rookie wideout Anthony Miller was also quite productive. Miller caught five of his six targets for 122 yards and a score.\n\nDo we dare put any stock in the Buffalo Bills' rout of the New York Jets behind new quarterback Matt Barkley? They scored more points on Sunday than they did in the entire month of October. However, if there's a possible diamond in the rough, it's wide receiver Zay Jones \u2013 who caught eight of 11 targets for 93 yards and a touchdown. Unfortunately, the Bills have an extra week to think about who'll be under center in their next game. They're on bye in Week 11.\n\nFollow Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner", "Indiana Pacers forward Thaddeus Young, right, shoots over Houston Rockets forward PJ Tucker during the first half of an NBA basketball game, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Houston. (AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 It's more than three weeks into the season and the Houston Rockets finally got their first home win on Sunday night.\n\nWith the hole they're in early, they'll need plenty more to dig their way out.\n\nJames Harden scored a season-high 40 points and Chris Paul added 26 to help the Rockets to a 115-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night.\n\n\"It's nice to get a win,\" Paul said. \"We've obviously been struggling ... but we've got to keep building.\"\n\nThe Rockets, who had lost the last two games of a season-long five-game road trip, dropped their first four home games. They're 5-7 this season and in 12th place in the Western Conference.\n\nHouston was up by 10 with about four minutes left after five quick points by the Pacers, but Harden made two free throws after that to stretch the lead. The Pacers got within 8 on a basket by Cory Joseph with about 90 seconds left, but Paul made a layup a few seconds later to put the game out of reach.\n\nVictor Oladipo had 22 for the Pacers, who have lost three of their last four games.\n\n\"We knew they were very capable of getting hot even though they hadn't shot the ball well early this season,\" Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. \"We knew they were very capable and tonight they did. It was tough matchups trying to stop those guys.\"\n\nThe win comes as the Rockets deal with a disappointing start to the season and rumors and reports about Carmelo Anthony's status and future with the team. Anthony, who is in his first year in Houston, sat out for the second straight game with an undisclosed illness on a day the New York Times had a sourced report that said he had been told he would soon be waived.\n\nGeneral manager Daryl Morey said before the game that the report was \"inaccurate\" and that singling Anthony out as the cause of Houston's struggles was unfair.\n\nThe Rockets, who entered the game ranking near the bottom of the league with a 3-point shooting percentage of just 31.7, shot 42.6 percent from long-range and made a season-high 20 3s on Sunday night. Harden had eight and Paul added five to lead the way.\n\n\"When we're like that we're going to score a bunch of points and if ... our defense can keep improving then we're the team that we want to be,\" coach Mike D'Antoni said.\n\nHouston had a big lead for most of the second half and was up by 21 entering the fourth quarter after Paul and Harden had piled up 55 points combined in the first three quarters.\n\nThe Pacers opened the fourth with an 11-2 run, with the last five points from Oladipo to cut the lead to 104-92 with about 7 \u00bd minutes left.\n\nBut Harden, who finished with nine assists and seven rebounds, made all of Houston's points in a 5-2 run to stretch the lead and 109-94.\n\nThe Rockets led by 22 at halftime but Indiana scored the first 11 points of the third quarter to cut the lead to 76-65. Darren Collison made two 3-pointers in that span and Oladipo added another one.\n\nHouston finally scored its first points of the second half when P.J. Tucker made a 3-pointer with about 9 \u00bd minutes left in the third.\n\nBut the Rockets couldn't get much going after that and the Pacers scored five straight points later in the period to cut the lead to 84-74 with about five minutes remaining in the third.\n\nHarden got hot after that, making 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to power a 12-3 spurt that extended the lead 97-77 about three minutes later.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPacers: Oladipo received a technical foul in the third quarter for arguing with a referee after fouling Paul. ... Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 points and had six assists. ... Collison had 13 points.\n\nRockets: Clint Capela had 18 points and seven rebounds. He bruised his knee in a collision with Oladipo, but D'Antoni said he should be OK. ... Gerald Green sat out with a sprained right ankle. ... Nene, who has not played this season, remains out with a strained right calf.\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\nPaul on what he's seen from Anthony in his time in Houston: \"Melo's been great here. That's like a brother to me. I don't know what's being said or whatnot but Melo's been great working hard every day.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPacers: Host Miami on Friday night.\n\nRockets: Visit Denver on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

So next time we've just got to know that no game is going to be easy.\"\n\nThe Seminoles, who are have their sights set on a third-straight NCAA tournament berth, and who advanced to the regional finals last spring, kept their composure in the crunch in the face of a packed and loud home-opening crowd in Tulane's cozy Devlin Fieldhouse.\n\nChrist Koumadje's dunk sparked a 10-0 Seminoles run that included layups by Mann and Trent Forest, and FSU maintained a double-digit lead for most of the final seven minutes.\n\n\"We handled it pretty well for the most part,\" Mann said. \"Getting through that, we've got to learn from it.\"\n\nForrest finished with 13 points and Mfiondu Kabengele scored 12 for Florida State (2-0), which shot 48.3 percent (29 of 60).\n\nSamir Sehic scored 19 points for Tulane (0-1), but took only four shots in the second half and missed all of them.\n\nTulane coach Mike Dunleavy said he was \"very encouraged\" by several aspects of his team's opening performance.\n\n\"We did OK,\" he said. \"We got ourselves back into it.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFlorida State: The Seminoles have yet to play this season with star forward Phil Cofer, who is out indefinitely with a foot injury. It hasn't mattered yet, thanks largely to their depth and ability to play lock-down defense for pivotal stretches. In addition to holding Tulane without a field goal for more than a 10-minute stretch in the middle of the he game, FSU forced 18 Tulane turnovers and converted them into 20 points. That defensive performance came after limiting Florida to 37 percent shooting in a season-opening win on Tuesday.\n\nTulane: The Green Wave delighted a packed home-opening crowd to a high-energy effort that kept the game competitive for significant stretches. That kind of showing \u2014 particularly with starting point guard Ray Ona Embo sitting out as he recovers from a knee injury \u2014 should give the Wave hope they can be more competitive in the American Athletic Conference this season.\n\nAUSPICIOUS DEBUT\n\nTulane could not have hoped for much more from Zhang, who scored on everything from four 3-pointers to a driving tomahawk dunk.\n\n\"Before the game I was a little nervous, but coach told me to just play hard,\" said Zhang, who moved from China to the United State at age 14. \"In the second half, I was trying to win the game, be aggressive.\"\n\nMann said he knew nothing about Zhang before the game, but added, \"now I do, man. I'm going to be following him. He's really good.\"\n\nDEFENSIVE PRESSURE\n\nAfter Jordan Cornish scored with 7:33 left in the half, FSU held the Green Wave without a field goal until 16:25 remained in the second half.\n\n\"We like to take pride in shutting people down,\" Mann said. \"If somebody gets hot, you know, there's nothing we ca do about it \u2014 like Zhang did. But if he didn't score the points he did, in the bunches he did, we really would have shut them out for the most part in the second half.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlorida State hosts Canisius on Nov. 19\n\nTulane hosts Coastal Carolina on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Hefti) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Derek Carr rolled to his right, felt pressure from Melvin Ingram and threw the ball at the feet of Jalen Richard when no one was open.\n\nThe problem for the Oakland Raiders was that play came on fourth down.\n\nFar more went into the fifth straight loss for the Raiders than that one botched play in the fourth quarter of a 20-6 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, but it was symbolic of how frustrating things have become for the Raiders.\n\n\"We had a play designed for Jalen versus their coverage and they just covered it well,\" Carr said. \"I wish I had a better answer but they did. Stuff happens.\"\n\nPlenty of bad has happened to the Raiders this season in the first year of Jon Gruden's second stint as coach of the franchise. Star pass rusher Khalil Mack was traded a week before the start of the season, No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper was dealt away last month and the losses keep mounting.\n\nThe Raiders (1-8) are off to the third-worst start in franchise history, trailing only the 0-10 mark in Carr's rookie season of 2014 and an 0-13 mark in 1962 \u2014 one year before Al Davis joined the franchise as coach and then owner.\n\n\"This will be a year that a lot of us will never forget,\" Gruden said. \"It's painful. It's really hard. It's painful. It's going to be hard to sleep again, hard to get up in the morning.\"\n\nThe stretch the Raiders are currently on is as bad as any they've had in 59 seasons as a professional team. They have lost five straight by at least 14 points for the first time ever and are one 14-point loss shy of tying the single-season record for the most by any team since the merger.\n\nOakland has been outscored 75-9 in the past nine quarters and was held without a TD in consecutive games for the first time since 2012.\n\nAbout the only thing left this season is determining whether the Raiders will have the No. 1 pick in next year's draft.\n\n\"Every day we go out there we give it our all,\" rookie defensive tackle Maurice Hurst said. \"We don't prepare the way we do to tank. That's annoying to hear from fans. It's disrespectful.\"\n\nThis game didn't start off as poorly as the last few for the Raiders. They drove down to the 1 on the opening drive, thanks in part to a 42-yard run by punter Johnny Townsend on a fake.\n\nGruden went for it on fourth down and called for a shovel pass to receiver Dwayne Harris who was going in motion across the formation. But Derwin James read the play and stopped it for no gain.\n\n\"That play should be second-guessed because it didn't work,\" Gruden said. \"But that wasn't the plan. That wasn't the plan.\"\n\nThe Raiders were outgaining the Chargers 165-6 early in the second quarter when they faced a third down at the 21, leading 3-0. Melvin Ingram then beat Kelechi Osemele off the line and came in unblocked for a strip sack that set up the Chargers' first score and turned the tide of the game.\n\nThat was one of four sacks taken by Carr, whose 28 sacks are the fourth most by a Raiders QB through nine games and three shy of his career worst.\n\nLos Angeles then scored TDs on the final possession of the first half and the first of the second half, and the Raiders were forced to play catch-up to no avail.\n\nThey settled for another field goal on a red-zone trip before Carr's throwaway in the fourth quarter ended their third red-zone possession without a touchdown.\n\n\"When we are down there, we just got to get in and score touchdowns,\" Richard said. \"That's the only way you can win this game. There is only so many teams that you are going to be able to beat by just kicking field goals.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Robert Franks scored 31 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as Washington State beat Nicholls State 89-72 in the season opener for the Cougars on Sunday.\n\nFranks scored 19 of his 31 points in the second half going 3 of 6 from 3-point range. He was a factor on both sides of the floor using his length and athleticism.\n\nFreshman CJ Elleby added 12 points and eight assists for Washington State (1-0). In his first game as a Cougar, Elleby set the tone for the WSU fast break offense. The Cougars had 34 fast break points, while the Colonels only managed four.\n\n\"On my board when we start the game, it doesn't say starters and it doesn't say starting five. It says first wave,\" said WSU coach Ernie Kent. \"So, it doesn't matter who is in the first wave because that second wave is coming.\"\n\nThe teams traded baskets in the beginning stages of both halves, but two Cougar runs defined the game. The first was a 6-0 spurt that gave Washington State a 14-point lead with 2:37 remaining in the first half. Then a 7-0 run pushed WSU's lead to 77-58 with 6:25 to play.\n\n\"You have got the closing of the first half, closing of the second half. It really is about rhythm and that's what I kinda coach with,\" said coach Kent.\n\nThe Colonels went on a scoring drought of more than 3\u00bd minutes during that stretch, going 0 of 6 from the field.\n\n\"I was disappointed with the final eight minutes, I felt that we kind of fell apart as a team and as a whole,\" said Nicholls coach Austin Claunch.\n\nClaunch added that he would have liked to see more fight out of his men down the stretch when things started to go sideways but credited WSU on their effort on both sides of the floor.\n\nGavin Peppers scored 16 points with six rebounds for Nicholls (1-2). Daniel Regis added nine points, seven rebounds and three blocks. Nicholls stayed in the game up until the last eight minutes but committing 19 turnovers proved too much to overcome for the Colonels.\n\n\"Their 1-3-1 (zone) was really good,\" said Claunch. \"It's hard to simulate that in practice because they have such good length. It is the first time we have seen zone this year to that extent, I thought we took too many 3s.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWashington State: The Cougars started the season 6-0 last year and look to duplicate the same kind of early season success. Starting the season off with a win is a good start but the Cougs are expected to finish at the bottom of the Pac-12 this season.\n\nNicholls: The Colonels fall to 1-2 on the year and will look to bounce back when they face the Idaho Vandals from the Big Sky Conference just seven miles from Pullman.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNicholls plays Idaho on Tuesday.\n\nWashington State plays Seattle University on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Stephen Dunn) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSTORRS, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Tarin Smith scored 22 points to lead UConn over Missouri-Kansas City 94-66 Sunday at Gampel Pavilion.\n\nThe fifth-year senior guard shot 10 for 12 from the field to lead the Huskies (2-0). Smith transferred to UConn in the offseason from Duquesne, where he was the Atlantic-10 Sixth Man of the Year last season.\n\n\"Whatever the team needs,\" said Smith, who has been on a minutes restriction after suffering a quad injury over the summer. \"I think I just have fun playing basketball and with guys that are as talented as the guys I play with, and just getting people involved is fun for me.\"\n\nJalen Adams had 20 points, Alterique Gilbert scored 12 and Christian Vital added 10 rebounds in a balanced Husky offense. The last time UConn scored at least 90 points in a game was Feb. 8, 2017, when it beat South Florida 97-51.\n\nUConn won its opener 80-70 on Thursday over Morehead State, but struggled to close the game. The Huskies had no problem this time after leading 50-33 at the half.\n\n\"I thought we showed a lot more of the killer relentlessness for longer stretches when we had a chance to extend the lead,\" UConn coach Dan Hurley said.\n\nDanny Dixon led UMKC (0-3) with 15 points and Brandon McKissic added 10.\n\nTied 12-12, UConn used a 23-3 run to take control. Eight of the nine Huskies who played scored at least a basket in the first half.\n\n\"You have to give a lot of credit to UConn,\" UMKC head coach Kareem Richardson said. \"First and foremost they defend their tails off and make everything physical and make everything tough.\"\n\nSmith shot 7 of 9 from the field and had 15 points off the bench. UConn had only 18 bench points in its opening win against Morehead State, but finished with 36 in this win.\n\nThe Huskies scored 13 points off UMKC's seven turnovers and picked up 14 fastbreak points.\n\nUMKC, which was playing its third straight road game, held its last lead at 10-9 at 16:01.\n\nAfter shooting 53 percent in the first half, UConn cooled off in the second, making just 2 of 13 attempts in the opening seven-plus minutes. UMKC was only able to cut its deficit to 58-43 during that stretch before UConn's offense awoke.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\"I think Tarin is one of our very best players,\" Hurley said. \"I recruited him at Rhode Island and he went to Nebraska on me. I guess that's why I'm not going to start him ... maybe I hold grudges.\"\n\nROLE PLAYER\n\nThe Huskies have been looking for their young frontcourt to emerge and this time sophomore Tyler Polley took a step forward with 12 points, including two 3-pointers, and four rebounds with one steal in 25 minutes.\n\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT\n\nFor the second straight game UConn finished on the plus side of the assist-to-turnover ratio with 17 and 12, respectively.

Cheatham appeared to be coming over to try to box Ward out, but he came in low, and the bigger Ward ended up in a dangerous position.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFGCU: The Eagles lost their top three scorers from last season's 23-win team, but it was the defense and rebounding that let this game get out of hand. Florida Gulf Coast was outrebounded 30-10 in the first half, when Michigan State had 11 offensive rebounds to FGCU's 0. The final rebounding margin was 49-25.\n\nMichigan State: It was an impressive all-around game for Ward, who not only contributed points and rebounds but also had a career-high four assists.

But Los Angeles allowed little after Melvin Ingram forced a fumble on a sack of Derek Carr early in the second quarter with the Raiders looking to add to a 3-0 lead.\n\nRivers found his stride after that, leading the Chargers to a field goal and then engineering a 91-yard drive at the end of the half that was capped by the throw to Allen in the front corner of the end zone.\n\nGordon, who had 93 yards rushing and 72 yards receiving, then put the game away when he caught a short pass from Rivers, broke a tackle by Gareon Conley, juked Reggie Nelson and raced in for the long score.\n\nLOPSIDED START\n\nThe Raiders missed opportunities to take a bigger lead while outgaining the Chargers 135-6 in the first quarter. Dwayne Harris was stopped by Derwin James on a shovel pass on fourth-and-goal from the 1 to deny the best chance for Oakland.

That was longer than his average punt of 41.9 yards coming into the game. Townsend then added his longest kick of the season with a 57-yarder in the second quarter. Townsend is the third player since the 1970 merger with a run of at least 40 yards and a punt of at least 50 in the same game, joining Cleveland's Reggie Hodges, who did it for Cleveland in 2010, and Jeff Hayes for Washington in 1983.\n\nSMOKY GAME\n\nThe air quality for the game was at an unhealthy level because of wildfires in Butte County, about 150 miles to the north.

Although the perfect season ended last week in New Orleans, Los Angeles still has never lost back-to-back games under coach Sean McVay.\n\n\"It means a lot, (because) there's a lot of tragedy that's been going on,\" said Aaron Donald, who had 2\u00bd sacks of Wilson after evacuating his family during the week. \"We've all been affected by it. We had to move ourselves, so to win a game like this, a divisional game, we're trying to give people something to smile about.\"\n\nFowler, the pass-rush specialist acquired from Jacksonville late last month, made up for his costly unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the third quarter by stripping Wilson of the ball and then recovering the fumble, setting up Cooks' run for a 12-point lead.\n\nWilson threw three touchdown passes, rushed for 92 yards and nearly rallied the Seahawks (4-5) all the way back after his fumble.\n\nWilson hit Mike Davis for a short TD catch to cap a 90-yard drive with 1:56 to play. After the Seattle defense held, he got the Seahawks to the Los Angeles 35 before throwing four straight incompletions in the final minute.\n\n\"I think the whole stadium was nervous on that last drive, (but) it didn't work out,\" Wilson said.\n\nWilson also threw TD passes to Nick Vannett and Tyler Lockett , but the Seahawks have lost two straight after winning four of five.\n\nSeattle took the lead with Lockett's TD catch in the third quarter, but only because their drive was kept alive by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against Fowler after a third-down stop.\n\n\"I knew I had to go out there and redeem myself,\" Fowler said.\n\nRUNAWAY LOSS\n\nRashaad Penny rushed for 108 yards and a touchdown in the injury absence of Chris Carson for the Seahawks., who had 273 yards rushing at the Coliseum after racking up 190 yards on the ground in their 33-31 loss to the Rams last month in Seattle. \"On this day, we went nose to nose,\" Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \"That's a statement to guys running the football. That's the whole thing fitting together.\"\n\nGURLEY'S GAINS\n\nGurley scored his NFL-leading 17th touchdown in the second quarter on a 17-yard run. He also scored a TD in his franchise-record 13th consecutive game, extending his franchise record. He is the fourth player in league history to score a TD in each of his team's first 10 games.\n\nSACK MACHINE\n\nDonald has a career-high 12\u00bd sacks already this season. He teamed up with Ndamukong Suh for a huge third-down sack at the Los Angeles 15 in the fourth quarter, forcing Seattle to kick a field goal.\n\nBIG GIFT\n\nRams left tackle Andrew Whitworth is donating his game check to the Ventura County Community Foundation's Conejo Valley Victims Fund, which was set up to help the families of the 12 people killed Wednesday night by a gunman in Thousand Oaks, the home of the Rams' training complex.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Less than 24 hours after their worst defeat of the season, the Arizona Coyotes hoped they'd get some better breaks against the defending Stanley Cup champions.\n\nThey came in the form of plentiful power-play opportunities.\n\nRichard Panik and Alex Galchenyuk each had a goal and an assist, and the Coyotes capitalized on two of five Washington penalties to add to the Capitals' penalty-killing struggles in a 4-1 victory on Sunday.\n\n\"Getting a couple of power-play goals helped,\" said Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet. \"I thought we skated pretty good. They came out in the second and I think we withstood that pressure by them.\"\n\nVinnie Hinostroza and Galchenyuk scored the fifth and sixth goals Washington's penalty kill has allowed over its last four games, helping Arizona snap a three-game skid and erase the frustration of a 4-0 defeat in Pittsburgh on Saturday night.\n\nDarcy Kuemper made 38 saves for the Coyotes in his third start in four days. In front of him, Arizona's own league-leading penalty kill improved to 20 of its last 21 after stifling two chances for a Capitals power play that entered Sunday ranked second in the NHL.\n\nDerek Stepan added an empty-net goal with 1:32 remaining, sealing one of Arizona's most important victories so far this season.\n\n\"Big bounce-back game, big win for us,\" Kuemper said. \"We get back on track now, and that's what we needed.\"\n\nNicklas Backstrom scored an even-strength goal in the second period for Washington, which ended a five-game homestand 2-2-1. Braden Holtby stopped 18 shots for the Capitals, who sustained five penalties, the eighth time in 16 games they've taken at least four.\n\n\"We've taken too many penalties throughout the first part of this year for sure,\" Capitals coach Todd Reirden said. \"It's one of the areas we have to clean up too, is the discipline and penalties, especially in the offensive zone.\"\n\nHinostroza put Arizona ahead at the tail end of their second man advantage of the game, sending in a one-time wrister of Dylan Strome's feed. Panik also contributed on the crisp odd-man rush by the Coyotes, created when three Capitals players were caught up ice trying to score short-handed.\n\nArizona caught Washington in transition again when Panik beat Holtby above his left shoulder to make it 2-0 just beyond the midpoint of the second period.\n\nBackstrom answered less than a minute later with a one-timer off Alex Ovechkin's feed from the left corner that left Kuemper little chance.\n\nBut the Coyotes made it a two-goal lead again with another power-play goal with 5:22 left in the period. This time, Galchenyuk stood strong to poke in a second effort from just in front of the crease after Brendan Perlini sent the puck toward the net.\n\n\"We had everyone going, and that's what we need to be successful,\" Kuemper said. \"Everyone was just doing their jobs tonight, and when that happens, good things happen for us.\"\n\nNOTES: Kuemper has made every start while Antti Raanta recovers from a lower body injury, with current backup Hunter Miska still awaiting the chance for his NHL debut.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The fans showed their love for the coach before the game. Then Atlanta United's players made sure Tata Martino has to stick around for a few more weeks.\n\nJosef Martinez scored two goals and Atlanta United won the first playoff series in franchise history, knocking off New York City FC 3-1 in the second leg of the Eastern Conference semifinals Sunday.\n\nAtlanta won the two-game series 4-1 on aggregate, clinching the victory with Martinez's second goal on a breakaway in the 83rd minute . The game drew a crowd of 70,526 \u2014 another attendance record for the 2-year-old franchise that has quickly developed one of the world's most rabid soccer followings.\n\nMartino, the former Barcelona and Argentina national coach who's been so instrumental to United's success, has already announced he'll be leaving at the end of the season, reportedly to head Mexico's national team.\n\nBut he's staying through the playoffs.\n\nHis players would love to give him a championship as a going-away gift.\n\n\"Tata is the face of the team,\" captain Michael Parkhurst said. \"We're still getting better, I think. I still think we can play a little bit better, and Tata continues to push us. It's just an extra motivating factor. We all want to win. We all want to be champions. That would be icing on the cake, for sure.\"\n\nDuring the pregame festivities, United's fans unveiled a towering, statue-like tifo of Martino that showed the coach in his trademark pose \u2014 arms crossed and a sweater tied over his shoulders. \"El Tata\" was written on the base.\n\n\"I've been very involved with everything Atlanta United \u2014 with the players, the club, the fans,\" Martino said through a translator. \"It's great that their recognizing that. I'm just very thankful.\"\n\nThe victory made up for the bitter disappointment of Atlanta United's inaugural season, when the expansion team made the playoffs but lost a knockout-round game at home to Columbus on penalties.\n\nAtlanta claimed a big edge in this series by winning the first leg, 1-0 at Yankee Stadium. United, which finished two points behind New York Red Bulls in the Supporters' Shield standings, returned home merely needing a tie to go through to the conference final.\n\nThey got more than that, earning a spot against the Red Bulls. The Red Bulls beat Columbus 3-0 on Sunday night for a 3-1 aggregate victory.\n\nWith New York City pressing hard, knowing it would need two goals to advance, United wrapped up the series. Eric Remedi sent a brilliantly timed pass to Martinez, who was able to stay onside because Valentin Castellanos was lingering too deep in the zone out on the wing. Martinez controlled the ball with his shoulder, looked around for any signs of a challenge and blasted a shot past helpless keeper Sean Johnson.\n\nFrom there, the celebration was on. The big crowd pushed United past 1 million fans for the season and broke the Major League Soccer playoff record of 67,221 for last season's loss to the Crew.\n\n\"You run out of superlatives,\" Parkhurst said. \"Some guys might take it for granted, but most of us don't. We understand what a privilege, what an honor it is to play in front of this crowd. Not everybody has that opportunity. I'm just glad we put on a good performance tonight to match their energy.\"\n\nNot playing it safe, United went ahead in the 25th minute on Martinez's penalty kick, which was set up by Darlington Nagbe's long pass to Franco Escobar near the end line. Ismael Tajouri-Shradi converged on the Atlanta player, taking him down as he tried to spin away, prompting referee Mark Geiger to point immediately to the spot.\n\nMartinez gave a little hesitation as he approached the ball, slipping his shot inside the right post while Johnson dove left .\n\nAtlanta built a commanding 3-0 lead on aggregate when Miguel Almiron scored off a free kick in the 42nd. It began with a sloppy pass from Yangel Herrera, which was picked off by Almiron to send him flying toward the area. Herrera grabbed at the United star, both pulling him down and tripping him for a yellow card that easily could've been a red.\n\nAlmiron took the kick from about 25 meters, curling a left-footer over the wall and into the top left corner , just beyond the grasp of a leaping Johnson.\n\nBut New York City gave itself hope of pulling out the series with a goal late in the half after Escobar's hard tackle brought out another yellow card. The free kick deflected off an Atlanta player in the wall and went right to Maxime Chanot.\n\nEscobar compounded his initial mistakes by failing to mark Chanot, who easily headed it past keeper Brad Guzan in the 45th.\n\nThat turned out to be New York City's only goal in the series. The team lost for the third straight year in the conference semifinals.\n\n\"The most frustrating thing to have such a talented group to come up empty-handed in two games,\" Johnson said. \"Not just one, but two games. It is inexcusable for us as a team to not go out and get at least one result and advance. We are good enough to advance.\"\n\n__\n\nFor more AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Ryan Fitzpatrick has been down this road far more times than the veteran quarterback cares to remember.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost for the third straight time Sunday, failing to score a touchdown in a 16-3 loss to the Washington Redskins despite gaining 501 yards total offense and only punting once.\n\nFitzpatrick topped 400 yards passing for the fourth time this season, yet he may be headed back to the bench after the team's sixth loss in seven games following a 2-0 start.\n\nThat means Jameis Winston, benched after throwing four interceptions in a loss at Cincinnati three weeks ago, may be on the verge of getting another chance.\n\n\"We'll talk about all personnel issues (Monday),\" said coach Dirk Koetter, who also may consider changing kickers after Chandler Catanzaro missed two more field goals Sunday, one of them a 30-yarder.\n\nOne change Koetter's already made is resuming his role as offensive play caller.\n\nOffensive coordinator Todd Monken handled the responsibility for the first eight games, and the Bucs have the NFL's No. 1 passing attack and rank second in total offense.\n\nSo, why switch up before Sunday's game?\n\n\"Just my own reasons,\" Koetter said.\n\nThe Bucs (3-6) have missed the playoffs 10 consecutive seasons, the second-longest drought in the NFL behind the Cleveland Browns, who haven't earned a berth since 2002.\n\nFitzpatrick expects the team to stick together and eventually pull out of the tailspin.\n\n\"Unfortunately for me, I've been in this situation 13 straight years in terms of a team that isn't quite playing up to their potential and having some struggles,\" said Fitzpatrick, who's been with seven teams during a 14-year career.\n\n\"The only way I know how to get out of it is to just keep coming to work every day being a professional,\" Fitzpatrick added. \"Keep grinding, making sure you're putting in the work. ... I think we have a lot of professionals in that locker room, so that's not something I'm worried about.\"\n\nMoving the ball wasn't a problem Sunday. The Bucs outgained the Redskins 501 yards to 286 and got inside the Washington 20 five times.\n\nAn interception and two fumbles foiled scoring opportunities. A fourth turnover led to the last three field goals Dustin Hopkins kicked for the Redskins.\n\n\"We weren't good enough as a team, and that starts with me,\" Koetter said. \"To move the ball like that and come up with three points, you're just not going to win that way.\"\n\nFitzpatrick, 2-4 as a starter this season, shrugged off a question about whether he played well enough to retain the starting job.\n\n\"I love playing football. That's not something I concern myself with,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"If I get a chance to go out there, I try and do my best and play as hard as I can.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Jacksonville cornerback Jalen Ramsey had plenty to say this summer.\n\nNow that the temperatures are cooling, Ramsey seems to be toning down the rhetoric.\n\nHe may not have many more chances this season to get the league's attention. After a late fumble sealed the Jaguars' fifth straight loss, 29-26 at Indianapolis on Sunday, the Jaguars (3-6) find themselves sitting alone in the AFC South basement with their playoff hopes fading fast and the search for answers becoming increasingly more urgent.\n\nNobody sounds more frustrated than Ramsey.\n\n\"Things happen,\" he said. \"You have to try to bounce back from it. But we dug ourselves too big of a hole today.\"\n\nRamsey didn't stick around long following the game \u2014 and he didn't say much.\n\nBut it doesn't require too much thought to understand why last year's AFC runner-ups have made a mess of this season.\n\nAndrew Luck threw three touchdown passes and took the Colts (4-5) on four scoring marches before halftime to give Indy a 29-13 lead. The three-time Pro Bowl quarterback produced only two first downs in the second half but still finished 21 of 29 with 285 yards and one interception \u2014 playing far better than Ramsey suggested when he said of Luck in August, \"I don't really think he's that good.\"\n\nWhat Luck did was expose the Jags' mismatches by repeatedly going to his tight ends. Eric Ebron , Jack Doyle and Mo Alie-Cox combined for eight catches, 133 yards and three TD receptions \u2014 all in the first two quarters.\n\nAnd with Ramsey's tag-teaming cornerback A.J. Bouye out because of an injured calf, Luck didn't really have to throw at Ramsey much.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable difference between this game and last year's was that the Jags couldn't put much pressure on Luck. After recording 14 sacks against the Colts last year, Luck didn't go down a single time Sunday. He hasn't been sacked in four games, the longest stretch of his pro career.\n\n\"It's always tough on an offensive line when you get to third-and-long and you've got to hold the ball a little bit longer and give yourself a chance,\" Jaguars coach Doug Marrone said. \"But when guys were open early on, they were wide open. It's tough to get to the quarterback. I think we might have hit him two or three times, but they were all on deeper third down plays.\"\n\nOne of those hits drew an unnecessary roughness call against Malik Jackson \u2014 after Jacksonville had called timeout. The penalty converted a third-and-3 into a first down, which helped the Colts score their final touchdown.\n\nThere was plenty of blame to go around, though.\n\nTwo plays after Jackson's 15-yard penalty, linebacker Myles Jack was called for unnecessary roughness. And when the Jags jumped offside on the ensuing extra point, Marlon Mack made the decision to go for 2 a wise choice by plunging in from 1 yard out to make it 29-13.\n\nNot enough?\n\nEbron scored on a 53-yard pass seven plays into the game and again on a 12-yard TD in the second quarter. In between those two, he scored on a 2-yard run.\n\nWhile the defense improved in the second half, the mistakes continued.\n\nJosh Lambo, who had an extra point blocked in the first half, missed a 52-yard field goal wide left before making a 55-yarder with 4:03 left to get the Jags within 29-26.\n\nAfter a defensive stop, Blake Bortles quickly got Jacksonville into field goal range and appeared to have them in perfect position when the officials ruled Rashad Green Sr. went down at the Colts' 23-yard line before the ball squirted free. But just before the next snap, the replay official stopped the play, overturned the call and assured Jacksonville of another inexplicable loss.\n\nRamsey said the Jaguars were playing with a sense of desperation.\n\n\"That's how we were feeling before the game,\" he said. \"I mean we really wanted to win out, we wanted to win every game from here on out.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Richard) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Quarterback Matt Ryan packed his belongings, left Atlanta's subdued locker room and slowly walked down the corridor toward the team bus, pulling his wheeled luggage.\n\nHe and the Falcons may have left their playoff hopes behind.\n\nTheir three-game winning streak came to a screeching halt Sunday with a 28-16 loss to the Cleveland Browns, who put together one of their best all-around games in years against an Atlanta team that had seemingly turned its season around following a 1-4 start.\n\nBut the Falcons (4-5) committed a costly turnover in the second half, gave up a Cleveland-record-breaking 92-yard touchdown run to Georgia native Nick Chubb, and failed to execute on a critical trip to the red zone when the game was still winnable.\n\nAfterward, Atlanta coach Dan Quinn was at a loss to explain his team's puzzling performance.\n\n\"I thought we had made some improvement and some progress, so it's a setback,\" Quinn said. \"I like the fight of our guys. I know we'll come back to fight. When you miss an opportunity, whether it's a team that people on the outside say you should win or one people think the other way, I go into it and think you can get them all. When you don't get that done, for sure it stinks.\"\n\nIt was shocking considering the Falcons were coming off a well-balanced win over Washington last week and had fought their way back into contention in the NFC South.\n\n\"It was disappointing,\" said Ryan, whose solid stats (38 of 52 for 330 yards and two touchdowns) obscured other offensive issues. \"Obviously, you have to give credit to Cleveland. I thought they played really well and made a lot of good plays. We fell short and did not make enough plays when we needed to. We didn't play up to the standard that we are capable to playing.\n\n\"We need to do that as we move forward and get ready for next week. We have got to play better.\"\n\nDespite their problems, the Falcons were only down 14-10 at halftime, and with their high-powered offense, a comeback seemed inevitable against the Browns (3-6-1), who had dropped four in a row.\n\nAtlanta got the ball to start the third quarter and got a 23-yard completion from Ryan to Julio Jones on the first play. After an 8-yard loss, Ryan connected on a 4-yard pass to wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, who fumbled after a hit by Browns cornerback T.J. Carrie.\n\nCleveland recovered at Atlanta's 41 and quickly drove for a touchdown as rookie QB Baker Mayfield hit Duke Johnson for an 11-yard score to give the Browns a 21-10 lead.\n\nSanu's fumble had given the momentum right back to the Browns, but while they were shaky, the Falcons still seemed OK when they pinned Cleveland at its 8 after a punt.\n\nThe worst was yet to come.\n\nOn second down, Chubb found a crease on Atlanta's right side, cut toward the sideline and outran several Falcons to the end zone on the longest rushing play in Cleveland history \u2014 and the longest by any rookie since 1949.\n\nAs Chubb raced by, Quinn, Ryan and everyone else dressed in black and red on the Atlanta sideline could only watch helplessly as any thoughts of a comeback completely vanished.\n\nQuinn didn't want to speculate on what went wrong on the play. Suffice to say, little went right.\n\nStill, the Falcons were hanging around in the fourth quarter when a series of head-scratching plays perhaps best sized up their day.\n\nAtlanta drove to Cleveland's 6 before a short pass was followed by two runs up the middle that were stopped by the Browns short of the end zone. Then, on fourth down and inches from a TD, Ryan was inexplicably in the shotgun before he threw a pass toward third-string tight end Eric Saubert, who had no chance of making a catch.\n\nRyan's choice of targets was peculiar given his other options: Jones, Sanu and tight end Alex Hooper, who caught 10 passes. Even a running play made more sense.\n\nThe hard-to-understand performance and loss overshadowed a personal milestone for Jones, who reached 10,000 career yards receiving faster than any player in NFL history.\n\n\"It's always tough when you lose,\" said Jones, who had seven catches for 107 yards and one TD. \"We can make up stuff here and there, but at the end of the day it's on us. I'm going to keep saying that we can play better and we can do better, but with opportunities and things like that, we have to do better. That's it. That's the bottom line. We just have to get back to work.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

James Harden scored a season-high 40 points to lead the Rockets past the Pacers 115-103 for their first home win of the year.\n\nChris Paul added 26 points, then stood up for his good friend Anthony afterwards.\n\n\"Melo's been great here.

But after making two bogeys over the first 67 holes in the tournament, he made two bogeys in two holes on Nos. 14 and 15, and his lead shrunk to one shot when Danny Lee made a 20-foot birdie putt from the fringe on the 16th hole.\n\nLee finished with two pars for a 65.\n\nKuchar still wasn't entirely in the clear. His 15-foot birdie attempt rolled about 3\u00bd feet by the hole on No. 17 and he had to make that for par.

(AP) \u2014 Quinndary Weatherspoon continued his hot start to the season, scoring a season-high 22 points to lead No. 18 Mississippi State to a 77-59 victory over Hartford on Sunday.\n\nTyson Carter added 14 points for Mississippi State (2-0), and Aric Holman had 12 points and eight rebounds. Nick Weatherspoon had 10 points.\n\nJason Dunne led Hartford (0-3) with 17 points, and John Carroll added 16.\n\n\"I am glad we got the win,\" Mississippi State coach Ben Howland said. \"Hartford won 19 games a year ago and they are well coached. Dunne shot it well for them and we had a chance to break it open a couple of times but couldn't quite do it. They are tough to defend and it was a good test for us.\n\n\"Tyson gave us good minutes again, knocking down his shots. Q (Weatherspoon) had another good game and we did a good job on the glass with Holman and Abdul (Ado).\"\n\nThe Bulldogs shot 45.5 percent from the field and made 9 of 24 on 3 pointers, led by Carter's 4 of 7 showing beyond the arc. Mississippi State had 12 turnovers and collected 15 steals, including six by Weatherspoon.\n\nWeatherspoon poured in the 22 points two nights after scoring 21 in a season-opening win against Austin Peay.\n\nMississippi State also held a 36-28 rebounding advantage against Hartford with center Abdul Ado collecting a game-high 10 rebounds.\n\n\"We have guys that can handle the ball and shoot it well,\" Carter said. \"We know we can put guys in good position to score and I felt pretty good tonight. Last year we did not shoot well and we took some bad shots. So we have to watch the shots we take and make sure they are good shots.\"\n\nHartford shot 44.9 percent for the game and made just 6 of 20 beyond the arc. The Hawks were 9 of 11 at the free throw line and had 21 turnovers. Mississippi State scored 21 points off those Hartford turnovers and outscored the Hawks 20-4 on second-chance points.\n\nThe Bulldogs got off to a slow offensive start and missed eight of their first 10 shots. But Weatherspoon sparked the offense midway through the first half, scoring six points in the midst of a 14-3 run. The Bulldogs led by as many as 17 in the first half before settling for a 43-29 halftime advantage.\n\nThe Bulldogs made 6 of 13 beyond the arc in the first half and held a 20-11 advantage on the backboards.

They completed a franchise-record seven-game road trip at 5-2.\n\nZach Parise and Joel Eriksson Ek also scored for Minnesota.\n\nThe red-hot Granlund has four goals in his last three games and eight in his last 10.

You just believe you're going to get the job done in the end. That's the feeling that we have right here.\"\n\nJohnson, who fell to 2-3, had a string of 66 successive saves halted by Parise's goal.\n\nThe Blues were looking to win their third in a row for the first time this season.\n\n\"It's very disappointing,\" St. Louis center Ryan O'Reilly said. \"It stings.

(AP Photo/Richard W. Rodriguez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 With nine newcomers and the first preseason ranking in 20 years, TCU figures to lean on holdovers Alex Robinson, Desmond Bane and JD Miller to try to live up to the billing early.\n\nSuch was the case in the season's second game.\n\nRobinson scored 23 points, Bane added 22 to go with the 6-foot-8 Miller's game-high seven assists and the 20th-ranked Horned Frogs never trailed after struggling in the opener, rolling to a 79-62 victory over Oral Roberts on Sunday.\n\n\"Those three guys, we're real comfortable with them. They're real comfortable with us,\" said coach Jamie Dixon, starting his third season at his alma mater. \"But they're more comfortable with each other. We've just got guys that got to play together. That's what those guys bring.\"\n\nThe Horned Frogs (2-0) were sluggish in their opener, trailing by as many as 11 points before rallying to beat Cal State Bakersfield.\n\nBut TCU took the opposite approach against the Golden Eagles (1-2), running out to a 23-6 lead in the first seven minutes before Oral Roberts got within seven points in the second half.\n\nThe Horned Frogs reasserted control with a 7-0 run for a 50-36 lead, had another 7-0 spurt to push the margin to 22 and led by as many as 25 points in the second half.\n\n\"You've seen this a lot,\" ORU coach Paul Mills said. \"Sometimes you get a lead and people think it's going to be easier than what they anticipate. I am proud of our guys for their fight. The thing they began to do was to get out and try to get easier opportunities in transition.\"\n\nTCU redshirt freshman Kevin Samuel of Barbuda had his first double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Miller had 13 points to go with the assists as the Horned Frogs had assists on 22 of 29 baskets. Bane had five assists.\n\n\"We really had good spacing today's game,\" Miller said. \"Coach really emphasized in the first game we didn't have good spacing.\"\n\nEmmanuel Nzekwesi had 16 points and eight rebounds and Sam Kearns scored 15 for Oral Roberts in a matchup of teams with 17 newcomers between them. The Golden Eagles have eight.\n\n\"Anytime you have eight new guys, having not been in a Big 12 environment, you don't really understand the defensive end of the court,\" Mills said. \"I thought we established, got better there and allowed us to get back in the game.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOral Roberts: The Golden Eagles gave themselves something to build on by erasing a good portion of a 17-point first-half deficit before halftime. Although they faded after getting close in the second half, the bucket that got them within seven was a boost \u2014 an emphatic dunk from Kerwin Smith.\n\nTCU: In the opening minutes, the Horned Frogs looked determined to show something after falling behind early against Cal State Bakersfield. While the lull that followed didn't please Dixon much, the surge after the Golden Eagles got close in the second half was impressive in its variety.\n\n\"I thought we were really good early and then it just kind of got away from us, forced some shots, quick ones,\" Dixon said. \"That's just what you might expect with a team finding itself.\"\n\n3-POINT EFFICIENCY\n\nRobinson was 4 of 6 from 3-point range and Bane, the Big 12's best 3-point shooter last season, made two of four to help the Horned Frogs finish at 47 percent behind the arc (7 of 15). The Golden Eagles weren't anywhere close to that accuracy, making just five of 21 (24 percent).\n\nGETTING CLOSE\n\nDixon said point guard Jaylen Fisher is closer to a return after an eventful 10 months with a right knee injury that started with a meniscus tear in January. Fisher had arthroscopic surgery in September. \"He probably feels like he can play.

(AP Photo/John Hefti) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Philip Rivers took nearly 20 minutes to complete his first pass, the Los Angeles Chargers got gashed on a long fake punt and the offense put up a season low in yards.\n\nDespite a few hiccups along the way, the Chargers still managed to pull off another win for their longest winning streak in nine years.\n\nRivers overcame the slow start to throw two touchdown passes, Melvin Gordon gained 165 yards and the Chargers won their sixth straight game, 20-6 over the struggling Oakland Raiders on Sunday.\n\n\"You got to win these games,\" Rivers said. \"Just find a way to win them. It doesn't matter. I don't care how pretty they are, I don't care what the ratings are, all those things, third-down percentage. Yes, we acknowledge those and know we have to improve in those areas, but it's just find a way to win.\"\n\nRivers found his stride in time to throw an 11-yard TD pass to Keenan Allen in the second quarter to give the Chargers (7-2) the lead for good and a 66-yarder to Gordon on the opening drive of the second half.\n\nLos Angeles coasted from there against the Raiders (1-8), who have lost five straight games by at least 14 points under coach Jon Gruden and have been outscored 75-9 in the past nine quarters in what has quickly become a lost season.\n\n\"This will be a year that a lot of us will never forget,\" Gruden said. \"It's painful. It's really hard. It's painful. It's going to be hard to sleep again, hard to get up in the morning.\"\n\nOakland started quickly by controlling the ball for 23 of 29 plays in the first quarter and outgaining the Chargers by 129 yards. But Los Angeles allowed little after Melvin Ingram forced a fumble on a sack of Derek Carr early in the second quarter with the Raiders looking to add to a 3-0 lead.\n\nRivers responded to lead the Chargers to a field goal and then engineered a 91-yard drive at the end of the half that was capped by the throw to Allen in the front corner of the end zone.\n\nGordon, who had 93 yards rushing and 72 yards receiving, then put the game away when he caught a short pass from Rivers, broke a tackle by Gareon Conley, juked Reggie Nelson and raced in for the long score.\n\n\"I feel like every time a player gets the ball in their hands they want to take it to the house,\" Gordon said. \"It doesn't always work out how you think it will. Sometimes some things happen with some help and you get sprung out down there.\"\n\nLOPSIDED START\n\nThe Raiders missed opportunities to take a bigger lead while outgaining the Chargers 135-6 in the first quarter. Dwayne Harris was stopped by Derwin James on a shovel pass on fourth-and-goal from the 1 to deny the best chance for Oakland. Los Angeles then scored 10 points in the second quarter with a strip sack by Ingram denying Oakland a shot at a field goal and setting up one for the Chargers. Rivers hit Allen for the TD with 24 seconds left in the half.\n\nFAKING IT\n\nRaiders rookie punter Johnny Townsend pulled off a fake punt on the opening drive for a 42-yard run. That was longer than his average punt of 41.9 yards coming into the game. Townsend then added his longest kick of the season with a 57-yarder in the second quarter. Townsend is the third player since the 1970 merger with a run of at least 40 yards and a punt of at least 50 in the same game, joining Cleveland's Reggie Hodges, who did it for Cleveland in 2010, and Jeff Hayes for Washington in 1983.\n\n\"I completely blacked out on the play,\" Townsend said. \"I can't even tell you what happened during it. We prepared all week and did a great job of seeing the look and reacting to it.\"\n\nSMOKY GAME\n\nThe air quality for the game was at an unhealthy level because of wildfires in Butte County, about 150 miles to the north. The Air Quality Index was at 159 at kickoff, which is in the unhealthy zone, and smoke could be smelled throughout the stadium. The NFL had monitored the situation but the AQI never got near 200, the level where the game would have needed to be moved.\n\nINJURIES\n\nChargers LB Denzel Perryman left the game with a knee injury on the opening drive. ...

(Austin Anthony/Daily News via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The New England Patriots dipped into their bag of tricks, and wide receiver Julian Edelman threw to a wide-open Tom Brady.\n\nThe three-time NFL MVP stumbled toward the first-down marker only to be stopped a yard shy by Titans linebacker Wesley Woodyard. Then right tackle Marcus Cannon false started before Logan Ryan, a former Patriots cornerback, knocked down Brady's fourth-down pass to Edelman.\n\nBrady spent the rest of the game on the sideline, watching Brian Hoyer mop up Sunday after a very ugly and uncharacteristic performance in a 34-10 loss to the Tennessee Titans.\n\n\"It's hard to win in the NFL,\" Brady said when asked about being pulled. \"You can't take it for granted. And I think it's hard to win. If you don't play well, you don't win.\"\n\nBrady was 21 of 41 for 254 yards, and this was the second time in three games he finished without throwing a TD pass.\n\nThe Patriots (7-3) snapped a six-game winning streak with the offense sputtering and not performing up to their own standards against a team that hadn't beaten New England since Dec. 16, 2002.\n\nNew England came in ranked fourth in the NFL in averaging 30 points a game, and the Patriots hadn't scored less than 25 points in each of the past six games. Tight end Rob Gronkowski sat out for the third time in four games with ankle and back injuries, but they did get back rookie running back Sony Michel.\n\nYet New England was held to just 40 yards rushing, and Tennessee outgained the Patriots 385-284 in total offense. Worse, the Titans led 17-3 at the end of the first quarter, and New England managed only one touchdown drive the entire game. Coach Bill Belichick said the Titans did better than his Patriots in every facet of the game.\n\nThe Patriots also had allowed only 13 sacks this season coming in, yet allowed a season-high three sacks to the Titans who also hit Brady six other times. Woodyard, an inside linebacker, led the Titans with 1\u00bd sacks and three hits on Brady.\n\n\"We didn't do really much of anything well today, so everything was a problem,\" Belichick said of the pass protection.\n\nLeft tackle Trent Brown left briefly in the first half and was questionable to return because of illness. He was back for the start of the third quarter before leaving for good with an injured back. LaAdrian Waddle replaced him. Patriots tight end Dwayne Allen also hurt a knee.\n\nBut Michel managed only 31 yards on 11 carries, and the Patriots didn't have a run longer than 9 yards.\n\n\"We just couldn't get in a rhythm,\" Michel said. \"We just have to execute better.\"\n\nFormer Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler has struggled, giving up touchdown passes through the first half of the season. Tennessee kept second-year cornerback Adoree Jackson on Josh Gordon, and Brady threw 12 passes to Gordon. The receiver finished with only four catches for 81 yards \u2014 44 on the Patriots' opening drive on one completion.\n\nGordon said Jackson has a lot of promise in the NFL, but that the offense seemed a little rushed.\n\n\"It's tough for me to give good perspective,\" Gordon said. \"I'm not looking back and seeing the defensive line, but I think that's partially due to the fact I felt a little rushed.\"\n\nSeeing Brady on the sideline for the final two series surprised Ryan, who had never seen the Patriots quarterback not finish a game during his four seasons in New England.\n\n\"I've been on the other side with him, and teams lose focus and he's able to come back from 28-3,\" Ryan said referring to 2017 when the Patriots rallied to beat Atlanta in the first overtime in the history of the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots went three-and-out four times and settled for a pair of 52-yard field goals, and kicker Stephen Gostkowski pushed the second just wide left. They converted only 3 of 15 on third down.\n\n\"We just got outplayed,\" said Edelman, who finished with nine catches for 104 yards.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

Trysta Krick breaks down the biggest storylines from the weekend's action. USA TODAY\n\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (12) gets up off the field after slipping on a pass attempt during the first half against the Tennessee Titans at Nissan Stadium. (Photo: Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMike Vrabel made it sound so simple.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to make Tom blink,\u201d the Tennessee Titans head coach said on Sunday when asked about the key to neutralizing Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, as he and his squad did in a 34-10 thumping of New England on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf you make him blink and go to a second read, you've got a chance,\u201d Vrabel expanded. \u201cIf you let him rip it to the first guy he looks at, it's going to be a long day.\u201d\n\nObviously, Vrabel knew what he was talking about. The Titans\u2019 first-year head coach learned quite a bit about Brady during eight seasons (and three Super Bowl-winning campaigns) in New England from 2001-08.\n\nVrabel knows that making Brady blink is easier said than done. The quarterback has seen it all during a 19-season career chocked full of passing records and accolades. He has outsmarted some of the best defensive coaches and players of his era, and his coach Bill Belichick is a master of preparation. It\u2019s a rare occasion that an opponent can consistently surprise the Patriots.\n\nVrabel and Co., however, found a way.\n\nWorking side-by-side with defensive coordinator Dean Pees (who held the same position in New England from 2006-09 after two seasons as Bill Belichick\u2019s linebackers coach), Vrabel cooked up a recipe for success.\n\nMore: Ex-Patriots RB Dion Lewis rips former team as 'cheap' after Titans' win\n\nIt included an array of exotic blitzes, delays, stunts and counters to catch Brady and his linemen off guard. And in the secondary, the Titans disguised their coverages and switched assignments at the last second to avoid tipping him off to their intentions.\n\nThe frequent shifts caused Brady to hold onto the ball a beat or two longer, and that enabled the pass rushers to harass the quarterback. The Titans sacked him three times and hit him another six times. Brady completed a season-low 51 percent of his passes while throwing for just 245 yards and no touchdowns with a 70.6 passer rating. The 10 points mustered by the Patriots tied a season low. And the Patriots\u2019 three-for-20 showing on third downs fell well below their average success rate of 42.3 percent.\n\n\u201cWe didn't do much of anything well today, so everything was a problem,\u201d Belichick said at his postgame news conference. \u201cThey were better than we were in that area (third downs), along with a lot of other ones. ... The Titans were clearly the better team and deserved to win. They did, soundly.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t entirely surprising to see the Patriots struggle early against the Titans. Tennessee does boast the top defense in the league, limiting opponents to just more than 17 points a game. But the extent of New England\u2019s struggles did raise eyebrows. Typically, teams attack New England and make the Patriots wobble. But Belichick, Brady and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels normally do such a good job of adjusting to what foes throw at them, that original game plans are rendered useless.\n\nThe Titans managed to remain a step ahead all game long, however.\n\nOn defense, Vrabel and Pees followed a similar blue print to success that former Patriots defensive coordinator-turned-Lions coach Matt Patricia utilized earlier this season while handing the Patriots their second loss of the season. Outside of the two Belichick disciples, only Jacksonville\u2019s Doug Marone has managed to beat the Patriots this season. His defense also pressured Brady often.\n\nBut few offenses have used the amount of creativity as did Titans play-caller Matt LaFleur, who executed an offensive game plan that featured a variety of looks and wrinkles. Tennessee threw everything at the Patriots from jet sweeps to read-option plays and wild cat formations.\n\nIn Tennessee's diverse attack, outside of wide receiver Corey Davis and his seven catches for 125 yards and a touchdown, no Titans player put up gaudy numbers. Two backs rushed for just less than 60 yards apiece, and none of the other six pass catchers recorded more than 45 receiving yards.\n\nVrabel downplayed the significance of beating his former team. When asked about it, he said, \u201cLook, I'm happy to get above .500. It's a good football team that we played today and we beat.\u201d He said he had learned a lot during his time in New England, but that he feels honored and privileged to be a part of the Titans organization.\n\nThis game did indeed carry extra incentive for members of the Titans organization. Whether Vrabel, Pees and general manager Jon Robinson entered the game with a chip on their shoulders in facing their former team, several other former Patriots players who joined the Titans \u2014 cornerback Malcolm Butler, running back Dion Lewis, cornerback Logan Ryan and offensive guard Josh Kline \u2014 did.\n\nBelichick was content to let those players depart via free agency rather than meet their contract demands. As is often the case, he opts for the more affordable route, believing that he and his coaches can promote and plug nearly any one into their systems without missing a beat.\n\nBecause of those decisions, Lewis told reporters he wanted to make sure he made his former employers pay.\n\n\u201cHell yeah it\u2019s personal,\u201d he told reporters after the game. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you go cheap. You get your (expletive) kicked.\u201d\n\nWith the game nearly in hand, Vrabel and his coaches did have a little fun with the Patriots.\n\nLooking for a spark in the fourth quarter, McDaniels called for a double-reverse wide receiver pass to Brady. The quarterback made the catch but stumbled and fell short of the first down. A short time later, when needing a first down of their own, the Titans called the same play. Quarterback Marcus Mariota caught Darius Jennings\u2019 pass and picked up 21 yards.\n\nAsked about the ultimate troll move, Vrabel managed to keep a straight face. He explained that every team has gadget plays in their back pocket. But then he added, \u201cI wanted to see if it looked any better than theirs.\u201d\n\nAs just like just about everything the Titans did compared to the Patriots, it certainly did.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "Former Patriots running back Dion Lewis had an opportunity to get some payback against his old team on Sunday.

The Bills won 41-10. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The locker room was eerily quiet as New York Jets players got dressed, packed their bags and headed for the exits.\n\nTheir 41-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday was as ugly as it gets. And it further cast doubts on the future of coach Todd Bowles.\n\n\"Everything that could've gone wrong,\" Bowles said, \"went wrong.\"\n\nThe hot seat under Bowles reached a boiling point as the Jets (3-7) got completely manhandled by a Bills team that was led by Matt Barkley , who hadn't started in nearly two years, and entered with a league-low 96 points and had two touchdowns in its previous four games.\n\nNew York has now lost four in a row heading into its bye-week break. Whether Bowles will still be in charge when the Jets play again on Nov. 25 against New England seems immediately uncertain. But the coach spoke like a man approaching things like business as usual.\n\n\"We're going to take a long, hard look at everything this week, coaches and players,\" Bowles said. \"We're going to try like hell to win our last six games.\"\n\nThis loss, and the way it went down, could give owner Christopher Johnson pause when evaluating the future. It has seemed like a forgone conclusion to many that Bowles would not be back after the season. This latest loss, though, had many wondering if the coach will be back after Sunday.\n\nJohnson declined comment to reporters after the game when asked if he was considering a change.\n\nMany of the players insisted that the struggles can be attributed to lots of people, not just Bowles.\n\n\"T-Bowles is not the problem,\" safety Jamal Adams said. \"I'm going to ride with T-Bowles until the end. I don't care what the fans say. It's T-Bowles. I'm going to support my coach through thick and thin.\"\n\nWell, consider this the thinnest of thin.\n\nNew York started 39-year-old Josh McCown in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold, but he couldn't prevent a brutal loss in front of a frustrated fan base that booed lustily throughout.\n\nMcCown was 17 of 34 for 135 yards with two interceptions, and the Jets finished with just 199 total yards.\n\n\"That's the first time I felt like somebody really smacked us,\" cornerback Morris Claiborne said, \"and we didn't do nothing about it.\"\n\nBarkley sparked Buffalo's bumbling offense with two touchdown passes, including one to offensive tackle Dion Dawkins, LeSean McCoy broke out of a season-long slump with 113 yards rushing and a pair of TD runs, and the Bills (3-7) were in control before many fans had settled into their seats.\n\nOn Barkley's first play, he launched a 47-yard pass to Robert Foster. On the next play, Barkley handed off to LeSean McCoy, who scored his first touchdown of the season with a 28-yard run that gave Buffalo a 7-0 lead 49 seconds in.\n\n\"Honestly, we didn't expect to come out there like that,\" Adams said. \"We didn't expect this game to go like that. We didn't come out there and execute.\"\n\nBarkley and the Bills took a 14-0 lead midway through the opening quarter on a fluky play. On third-and-7 from the 11, Zay Jones caught a pass and took it 10 yards before fumbling as he reached for the goal line. Tight end Jason Croom recovered in the end zone for a touchdown that was upheld by video review.\n\nThe 14-play, 73-play drive was prolonged by a fake punt on fourth-and-6 from the Bills 47 when the ball was snapped directly to tight end Logan Thomas, a quarterback at Virginia Tech. Thomas then completed a 19-yard pass to Foster for the first down.\n\n\"I don't feel like anybody quit,\" Claiborne said. \"I just feel like the way the game went, it was their day coaching and their day playing.\"\n\nPerhaps the biggest sign of that came midway through the second quarter when Dawkins lined up as an eligible receiver on first-and-goal from the 7. Barkley, of course, found the 6-foot-5, 320-pound lineman wide open for a touchdown.\n\n\"We got our (butts) kicked,\" Adams said. \"It's as simple as that.\"\n\nThe boos from the frustrated fans at MetLife Stadium got louder at that point, and eventually turned into chants of \"Bye Bye Todd!\"\n\nClaiborne said he didn't hear those, but insisted he is standing by his coach.\n\n\"I have Todd's back, 100 percent,\" Claiborne said. \"He's a guy who definitely knows football, knows what he's talking about and knows how to coach his players. ... I have nothing but love for him. Where we're at is where we're at right now. We're trying to win with who we've got right now, period, point blank.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Bears won 34-22. (AP Photo/David Banks) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Glover Quin had a chance to stop Anthony Miller. He ended up on the ground on the sideline, watching as Miller sped toward the end zone.\n\nIt was that kind of day for Detroit's secondary.\n\nPlaying without injured cornerback Darius Slay, the Lions were picked apart by Mitchell Trubisky in a 34-22 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday. Quin, DeShawn Shead and Nevin Lawson each had costly missed tackles, and coverage issues created large swatches of open green grass for Allen Robinson and the rest of Chicago's receivers.\n\n\"It is on us,\" Quin said. \"We have to turn it around. At the end of the day, we're the ones out there playing. We have to get it fixed.\"\n\nDetroit (3-6) had played well against the pass in its first year under coach Matt Patricia, who was New England's defensive coordinator for six seasons before taking over the Lions in February. But the secondary issues for the Lions in their third consecutive loss looked more like their old teams than anything from Patricia's time with the Patriots.\n\n\"Ran into each other on one particular big play. We had a communication thing on another one,\" Patricia said. \"But look, in the end, I just got to do a better job coaching it up and getting them in the right positions and we got to go out and execute.\"\n\nThe trouble began on the first drive of the game. Shead was unable to bring down Robinson on a slant, and he ran all the way down to the Detroit 3 for a 35-yard play. Tarik Cohen carried the ball in for the Bears (6-3) on the next play.\n\nShead got the start in place of Slay, who was sidelined for the first time this season because of a knee injury.\n\n\"Look, we're going to play with whoever's healthy and whoever's ready to go,\" Patricia said. \"So, for us, if you're out on the field you got to perform. You got to go out and execute. So obviously we didn't do a good job early on with our execution in the back end.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old Shead had more trouble in the final minute of the first quarter. Chicago was facing third-and-15 at the Detroit 36 when Shead was beaten by Robinson at the line. He caught up, but couldn't find the ball as Robinson adjusted to make the catch in the end zone.\n\nIt was more of the same in the second quarter. Miller was wide open on a reception on the right side of the field. Quin came over and tried to bring him down near the 20, but Miller ran through his tackle attempt for a 45-yard touchdown that made it 19-0 with 11:24 left in the first half.\n\n\"We just have to execute better,\" Shead said. \"Just go in, look at the tape and just see, I mean the little things, the little mistakes. I know ... one play was miscommunication on my part on the back end. Just being on the same page and just jelling together and executing.\"\n\nChicago led 26-7 at halftime. Trubisky was 14 for 16 for 209 yards at the break with a perfect passer rating of 158.3.\n\nThe Lions' chances for a comeback took a hit when Robinson ran out of Lawson's tackle attempt for a 26-yard TD reception in the third quarter.\n\nDetroit began the weekend ranked fourth in the NFL with just 214.6 yards passing allowed per game. But Trubisky finished with a career-high 355 yards through the air, and Robinson and Miller each went over 100 yards receiving.\n\n\"There's a combination of a lot of fundamentals right now that need to be better across the board,\" Patricia said. \"Tackling is one of them, but there's certainly, obviously, a bunch of things we need to work on.\"\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul Vernon) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio State got coach Chris Holtmann a blowout win for his birthday, accompanied by a big bouquet of 3-pointers.\n\nC.J. Jackson scored a career-high 25 points and the Buckeyes scored 45 points off 3-point shots on the way to a 107-61 rout of Purdue Fort Wayne on Sunday \u2014 which also happened to be Holtmann's 47th birthday.\n\nJackson sparked it for Ohio State.\n\nWith the Buckeyes leading by just seven points at the intermission, he drained a trio of 3-pointers in the first four minutes of the second half. It wasn't much of a contest from then on as Ohio State clamped down on defense and the Summit Conference team wilted.\n\nDuane Washington Jr. scored 20 and Jaedon Ledee had 16 points on 12-of-14 free-throw shooting as Ohio State won for the second time in five days. The Buckeyes beat Cincinnati on the road Wednesday.\n\nJohn Konchar and Kason Harrell each had 13 for the Mastodons (0-2), who shot just 34 percent from the field. They shot 30 percent in the second half as Ohio State smothered them on defense and the game got out of hand.\n\nOhio State led 41-34 at the end of the first half on the strength of a pair of late 3-pointers hit 23 seconds apart by Washington. Konchar hit a layup on a fast break as time ran out in the half to keep the deficit at seven points.\n\n\"We just weren't making smart decisions defensively, and that kind of led to bad offense,\" Jackson said. \"We got a couple of silly turnovers in the first half, and that kind of slowed us down a little bit. We weren't making as many shots. Later we started being a little smarter with the ball, knocking down those same shots we were taking earlier.\"\n\nThe Buckeyes cleaned it up in the second half, putting up the team's highest point total in nearly two years, then sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Holtmann in the locker room afterward.\n\nRAINING 3-POINTERS\n\nThe Buckeyes were 15 for 28 from beyond the arc, a 54-percent success rate.

D'Angelo Russell did it in 2015.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nPurdue Fort Wayne: The scrappy Mastodons managed to hang in there until Jackson started raining 3s and the Buckeyes pulled away.\n\nOhio State: Jackson, the only senior among the starters, is on fire, posting a career high despite leaving the game with about six minutes left. And Ohio State's young players, particularly Muhammad and Washington, are looking more confident and meshing with the more experienced players \u2014 which is exactly why games against overmatched mid-majors are scheduled early in the season.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\"Chris has got the Buckeyes playing really good defense right now,\" Purdue Fort Wayne coach Jon Coffman said. \"You play that kind of defense \u2014 and I know it's only a couple games in \u2014 you're going to have a lot of success. And I'll attribute our lack of success in the second half to what Ohio State did today.\"\n\nTOO EARLY TO TELL\n\nHoltmann said even though his freshmen have been a major presence early, he doesn't know yet exactly what he's got.\n\n\"It's way too early in the season to have any real idea where we're at or make any statement about where we're at or where another team we play is at,\" he said. \"We're just trying to get better with every day in practice that's in front of us.\"\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nPurdue Fort Wayne: Hosts Manchester on Tuesday.\n\nOhio State: At Creighton Thursday night.\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Kelvin Kuo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA crazy day at ISM Raceway, which saw nearly all of the Round of 8 drivers in peril at some point, yielded a Championship 4 featuring the season\u2019s best cars.\n\nKyle Busch held off Brad Keselowski in the final dozen laps of the Can-Am 500 Sunday and will bring that momentum to the season finale next weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway. It was the eighth victory of the season for Busch, tied with Kevin Harvick for most this season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had an awesome year,\u201d Busch said. \u201cThe way that we\u2019ve been able to perform and how we\u2019ve been able to do things in this playoff \u2014 it hasn\u2019t quite been pretty all the time, but we did what we needed to do in key moments. If momentum is anything, obviously we\u2019re ready to go. We\u2019ll rock and roll into Homestead and it feels pretty good.\u201d\n\nHarvick, who saw his guarantee into the championship race erased when he was issued a major penalty after his victory last weekend at Texas Motor Speedway, had an adventurous day but overcame the hurdles to finish fifth and clinch his berth on points. He was joined in the Championship 4 by reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr., who finished a below-average 14th but had built up a big enough points cushion with his four wins this season to coast into Homestead.\n\nBusch actually didn\u2019t need to win to guarantee his berth in the Championship 4. He locked up that position when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. slammed into the wall with less than 50 laps remaining in stage 3. Busch, the 2015 NASCAR champion, only needed to finish Sunday\u2019s race 33rd or better, which was guaranteed once Stenhouse\u2019s day ended.\n\nBut it was a rough day for many of the other Round of 8 competitors.\n\nThe championship hopes of Kurt Busch and Chase Elliott were dashed after a collision on a restart with 43 laps to go. Denny Hamlin, battling for the lead, made contact with Busch, who restarted second, and both hit the outside wall. Busch then came back down the racetrack and slammed into the side of Elliott, resulting in big damage to both cars.\n\n\u201cI just got pinned on the outside wall,\u201d Busch said. \u201cDenny came out of nowhere and cleaned us out. We were coming; we were there. It was one of the best cars we ever had at Phoenix. We were racing for the win and didn\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nThe race took its first dramatic turn in the closing laps of the opening stage. Harvick, the 2014 Cup champion, led the first 72 laps before his right front tire went flat, forcing him to pit road with only two laps left in stage 1.\n\nHarvick, who holds the ISM Raceway record with nine Cup victories, had started on the pole and looked to be on his way to another dominating performance before the flat seemingly altered the course of the day for the No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing team.\n\nInstead of winning the opening stage and collecting 10 extra points, Harvick ended it 30th and one lap down. He began the second stage needing to pass six cars to become the first car one lap down, which would put him in position to get his lap back if the caution came out. It happened on lap 96, when Joey Logano\u2019s left rear tire went flat, causing the No. 22 Ford to spin and bring out the yellow flag.\n\nLogano had already clinched his berth in the Championship 4 with his victory two weeks ago at Martinsville Speedway, but the damage his car incurred on the spin ended his day early.\n\n\u201cWe won Martinsville and that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re gonna race at Miami,\u201d Logano said. \u201cIt is what it is. We\u2019ll move on from this. There\u2019s not much we can do about a tire going flat. We\u2019ll just go to Miami and race for a championship.\u201d\n\nAnother championship contender, Clint Bowyer, went for spin near the end of the second stage when the left rear tire of his No. 14 Ford went flat.\n\nBowyer had been running in the top 10 before the tire went down on lap 133. The Stewart-Haas Racing driver\u2019s car careened into the outside retaining wall between turns 3 and 4, and he was forced to exit the race, eliminating him for title contention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve run low air (pressure in the tires) on these short tracks on our left sides and maybe that was it,\u201d Bowyer said in attempting to explain why his tire went down. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of the way our playoffs are going. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nOn the ensuing pit stop, race leader Kurt Busch was penalized for passing the pace car while entering pit road and given a one-lap penalty. Busch, who led 52 laps in Stage 2, became the third SHR driver with issues in the race.\n\nBusch exploded over his car radio after being told of the penalty, prompting team owner and former champion Tony Stewart to come on the radio to try to calm his racer down, telling him, \"Kurt, take a deep breath.\u201d\n\nAric Almirola, the final SHR driver in the playoffs, had a strong fourth-place result, but his points deficit had left him in must-win territory on Sunday.\n\nFollow Horrow on Twitter @EllenJHorrow\n\nCAN-AM 500 RESULTS\n\nSunday from the 1-mile ISM Raceway in Avondale, Ariz.

(AP Photo/Frank Victores) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Broken coverage by broken coverage, missed tackle by missed tackle, yard by yard, the Bengals made history for horrific defense. Cincinnati keeps giving up big numbers, and now the losses are mounting, too.\n\nDrew Brees threw for three touchdowns, and the New Orleans Saints scored on every possession except the last one \u2014 when they took a knee \u2014 during a 51-14 victory on Sunday that left Cincinnati in disarray.\n\nThe Bengals (5-4) have given up 500 yards in three straight games \u2014 a first in the Super Bowl era \u2014 and are on pace to give up an NFL record for yards in a season. Of all the bad showings on defense, this was the worst.\n\nThe Saints (8-1) moved the ball even when they were trying to run out the clock. What little was left of the crowd of 52,492 booed loudly when it ended with New Orleans taking a knee three consecutive plays \u2014 technically, Cincinnati's only defensive stop of the day.\n\n\"I haven't seen anything like it,\" linebacker Preston Brown said. \"Every week we're giving up too many yards.\"\n\nThe Bengals knew they'd be in for some growing pains when they decided to field the youngest team in coach Marvin Lewis' 16 seasons, with most of the inexperience on defense. They also brought in coordinator Teryl Austin, who changed some of their schemes.\n\nIt's not working, and the Bengals seem to have run out of ideas for what to do next.\n\n\"Obviously, your confidence gets shaken,\" Lewis said. \"I just addressed that with them. They have to focus and get determined. It's their job to do it right.\"\n\nShaken, and deeply disturbed.\n\n\"I'm kind of in shock after a loss like that,\" linebacker Jordan Evans said.\n\nIn the last four games, the Bengals have given up 481, 551, 576 and 509 yards. They're allowing an average of 454 yards per game, worst in the league.\n\nThey're on pace to allow 7,272 yards, which would be an NFL record. The 2012 Saints are the only team to give up 7,000 in a season, 7,042 in 2012.\n\nThe Bengals opened the season 4-1 despite giving up a lot of yards. Four defensive touchdowns played major roles in the fast start, and the offense managed to keep up and pull out two wins at the end. With A.J. Green out indefinitely because of a toe injury, the offense is limited.\n\n\"We always want to score, but at the end of the day, our defense has got to get some stops,\" receiver Tyler Boyd said. \"You can't let the other team score on every drive.\"\n\nThat's what the Saints did.\n\nBrees led the Saints to touchdowns on all five first-half possessions with a nearly perfect performance \u2014 only two incompletions. His 17-yard TD to Michael Thomas with 2 seconds left in the half gave him 509 career touchdown passes, one more than Brett Favre for second on the career list. Peyton Manning holds the record with 539.\n\nBrees had his way with the Bengals' historically bad defense , even diving over the pile to score a 1-yard touchdown.\n\nThe Bengals matched the most lopsided defeat in franchise history and gave up the second-most points in club history. In the first half alone, the Saints piled up 311 yards and had 21 first downs on 40 plays. The 28 points allowed in the second quarter matched the club record.\n\nEven more shocking: Cincinnati was coming out of a bye and had two weeks to prepare for the Saints. The Bengals thought they'd get some of their issues resolved.\n\n\"It didn't look like it,\" Brown said. \"We gave up 500 yards.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Most of the stars of the 2005 NBA Finals have been out of the league for several years.\n\nTony Parker, is still beating the Detroit Pistons.\n\nSunday, he faced them for the first time as a member of the Charlotte Hornets, but the results weren't any different. The 36-year-old scored 24 points in 28 minutes off the bench to lead Charlotte to a 113-103 victory.\n\n\"That's what Tony does. I'm just surprised that he never loses any of his speed and quickness,\" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. \"He got to every spot he wanted to out there, and we weren't stopping him.\n\n\"He's probably going to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but we've got to be better.\"\n\nParker improved to 20-11 in the regular season against the Pistons, first playing them as a 19-year-old with San Antonio on Jan. 2, 2002. The Spurs also beat Detroit in seven games in the 2005 finals.\n\n\"(Tony) is a leader,\" said Kemba Walker, who had 24 points and seven assists. \"He brings passion and the winning attitude. He just knows how to win.\"\n\nCody Zeller added 14 points as Charlotte won for the third time in four games.\n\n\"I thought they were great tonight,\" Charlotte coach James Borrego said. \"Their effort and their attention to detail were fantastic. I'm really proud of our group on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nAndre Drummond had 23 points and 22 rebounds for the Pistons, and Reggie Bullock had a career-high 23 points, hitting six 3-pointers. Detroit has lost six of eight after a 4-0 start.\n\n\"We are our own worst enemies,\" Casey said. \"We have to make shots and we have to stop getting caught out of position on defense. I'm going to have to make sure everyone understands our defensive assignments.\"\n\nDetroit's Blake Griffin was given a flagrant-2 foul and ejected with 7:06 to play for a shoulder check on Malik Monk.

We were really good until we got to 78 points on offense. Then we just stopped. But I think we've shown that mindset and that consistency. Certainly you want to see that.\"\n\nNebraska (2-0) held Southeastern Louisiana (1-2) scoreless for 8:41 in the first half run. The Lions missed 10-straight shots and turned the ball over nine times during that stretch, which began when Nebraska switched its defenses \u2014 playing zone as well as man-to-man and putting on a full-court press.\n\n\"I think it really helped us,' Miles said of the defensive switching. \" We had 16-straight stops in the first half. The press and the zone were part of that. ... I thought it really helped tonight, to keep Southeast Louisiana off balance. After the first 3\u00bd, 4 minutes, we stopped them in man or zone or press. It was all good for us.\"\n\nThe Huskers went up 10 on Glynn Watson, Jr.'s layup with 12:20 left in the half and led 26-7 before the Lions scored to end the drought. The Nebraska lead went to 20 on Amir Harris' layup that made the score 34-14. The Huskers took a 31-point lead on Brady Heiman's dunk at the 2:02 mark and led by 36 at the half.\n\nNebraska led by as many as 53 in the second half.\n\nThe Huskers forced 25 turnovers, turning them into 33 points. Nebraska hit 17 of 22 free throws. The Lions were just 2 of 4 from the line. Nebraska dominated the paint as well outscoring the Southeastern Louisiana 42-22.\n\n\"Nebraska is a really tough team,\" said Southeastern Louisiana coach Jay Ladner. \"We could play them 100 times and we're not going to beat them. Going back to last year, I thought it was a crime they didn't get into the NCAA Tournament. They brought most of that team back this year, so we knew we had a tall order.\"\n\nJames Palmer, Jr. led Nebraska with 17 points.

(AP Photo/Ed Zurga) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The catch that Larry Fitzgerald secured late in the fourth quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday did nothing to change the outcome: another loss for Arizona in a season full of them.\n\nIt was hardly meaningless to the veteran wide receiver.\n\nThe catch moved Fitzgerald past Terrell Owens into second place on the NFL's career reception yardage list. He finished the Cardinals' 26-14 loss to the Chiefs with six catches for 50 yards, giving him 15,952 yards \u2014 behind only Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice.\n\n\"It happens to be Terrell Owens and I'm pretty close with T.O. His friendship and my relationship with him is invaluable to me,\" Fitzgerald said afterward. \"He means a great deal to me, and to be mentioned in the same breath with him means a lot to me.\"\n\nThe biggest lament for Fitzgerald, though, was that the yardage he needed came when the outcome was decided. He was shut out on three targets in the first half as the Chiefs took a 20-7 lead.\n\n\"It's always important for us to try to get our good players involved, and we try to do it a little early. We didn't have an opportunity there,\" Cardinals coach Steve Wilks said. \"He didn't have any catches, rather, so we came out in the second half really trying to find ways to get him the football.\"\n\nBy the time the Cardinals did, it was too late.\n\nPerhaps that was fitting considering Fitzgerald has pieced together one of the finest careers in NFL history relatively quietly, with some of his best seasons coming in the Cardinals' worst years. The 35-year-old Fitzgerald has had at least 100 receptions each of the past three seasons, and five times in his career, while piling up nine seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving.\n\nHe has 40 catches for 407 yards and two touchdowns this season.\n\nAnd while Fitzgerald is almost certain to fall short of the numbers he is accustomed to producing, he is nevertheless providing another year of invaluable service: He's the steady, capable and wise veteran in the ear of Josh Rosen, who is expected to lead the Cardinals for years to come.\n\nThe rookie quarterback had plenty of bright spots Sunday, even though he was sacked five times and threw a pair of costly interceptions. He threw a touchdown pass to David Johnson, kept the offense moving, and did a fair job of checking out of plays that were bound to go nowhere.\n\nHe also made sure to find Fitzgerald down the stretch, ensuring he'd get his meaningful yardage.\n\n\"It's frustrating that it comes in another loss,\" Fitzgerald said, \"but I think, offensively, we're on the field a lot more. Would have loved to have more points, but it's another step in the right direction. Almost 30 minutes of possession time, so I mean, we're on the field. We were better on third down today. But there's things we need to clean up.\"\n\nThere are goals for Fitzgerald and the Cardinals (2-7) the rest of the way, too.\n\nFitzgerald needs eight more receptions to pass Rice (1,281 with San Francisco) for the most in NFL history with one team. And the Cardinals can prove they're moving in the right direction under Wilks with a strong finish against a relatively tough schedule.\n\nThe Raiders are next, but games against the Packers, Falcons, Chargers, Seahawks and Rams loom.\n\nPlenty of chances for Fitzgerald to add to his lasting legacy.\n\n\"This is something I'll think about when I'm done playing. I can look back and reflect on it at a later time, but today is not the day,\" he said. \"It's nice to be able to do that with the same team, to have so many wonderful teammates that continue to fight regardless of our record. I know we're 2-7, but I love coming to work and playing for these coaches and playing with my teammates.\n\n\"It's a great group of men,\" he said, \"and we just want to get it right.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY)\n\nBook early. Give yourself a little extra time at the airport or on the road. Prepare for bad weather. If you've read that obvious holiday travel advice once, you've probably read it a hundred times.\n\nAnd I've probably written that holiday travel advice a hundred times. But this year, how about something a little different?\n\nA record 107.3 million traveled during the busy winter holiday season last year, according to AAA. That's the highest year-end travel volume on record. It looks like this one will be just as busy, which means chances are, you'll get caught up in the craziness.\n\nYou won't find this holiday travel advice anywhere else. It includes tips on how to behave, how to book, what to pack and how to travel.\n\nFirst, be kind to others. No, this isn't obvious travel advice. If it were, then everyone would do it. But they don't. The holidays are a time of road rage and in-flight altercations. You can scroll back to the main travel page now if you don't believe me. Go on, I'll wait here.\n\n\"Be nice to airline employees as they can try to help in the event of a problem,\" says Marilyn Wexler, a travel agent with Tzell Travel-New England in Boston. \"They're more likely to go out of their way for a nice traveler. Remember, it is not their fault that the weather is bad. Most people do not enjoy being berated.\u201d\n\nLook before you book. That means doing your due diligence on your airline tickets and accommodations. Travelers assume that companies will disclose everything worth knowing at the time they quote a room rate or fare. Not true. In fact, many companies doctor up their initial price quote to make it look lower than it is, quoting rates minus taxes and mandatory fees.\n\n\"For travelers who can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to stay with family members over the holidays, hotels aren\u2019t the only option,\" says David Kolodny, co-founder of VacationRenter.com, a vacation rental search site. \"By considering alternative lodging, they can avoid the hectic, crowded feel of hotels over the holidays.\" (Alternative lodging would be an RV, a vacation rental, or Uncle Joe's couch.)\n\nPack your patience. OK, maybe you've heard that advice. But have you? Most of the holiday travel advice I've read allows you to conclude that by following a simple laundry list of suggestions, you won't need to be patient. But you will. Oh, you will.\n\n\"Expect that everyone believes their trip is more important than yours,\" says Marcie Boyle, a travel agent with Travel Leaders in Chesterfield, Missouri. \"Expect the airports and planes to be crowded. Expect security, restroom, and restaurant lines to be extra-long. Expect to encounter less experienced travelers who may not know the tricks for getting through an airport quickly.\"\n\nYou'll need all the patience you can muster \u2013 and then some.\n\n\"Take a deep breath and know everyone is doing the best they can to get the job done,\" she adds.\n\nBe careful out there. Sure, I've seen experts dance around this one, but travel can be dangerous. Don't take my word for it. That's what Andres Paz Larach, vice president of southeast U.S. and Latin America with Pinkerton, says.\n\n\"You have to study your destination,\" he says. \"Understand where you are going, the population, manners, the dress. Act appropriately with the culture. Abide by the laws of the land.\"\n\nTo travel safer, you also have to research the emergency numbers (which are not always 911), local law enforcement, hospitals and transportation routes. Find out more about where you're visiting and what common threats might be. A trusted source is the State Department Advisories page, travel.state.gov.\n\n\"Take steps to protect yourself from local threats,\" he adds.\n\nAnd while we're at it, let me make a personal plea for a little common sense. Don't think this is going to be easy. It rarely is. If you can avoid traveling just before or after the holidays, when everyone else is on the road, do it. Better yet, don't travel at all. You'll save a bundle, and you can always see your family in January.\n\nAnd please lay off the eggnog until you get to mom's house this year. I want all of my readers to come home safely. What you do after that is up to you.\n\nMore unconventional holiday travel advice\n\n\u2022 Stay a little longer. That's the advice of Christopher Bielski, the sales and marketing director for the Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach Resort & Spa. Lodging rates fall when everyone returns home. And if you can extend your stay over a Sunday, you can save money. \"Any time you can include a Sunday night stay at a resort or hotel you are likely to get a better rate as Sundays are very difficult to fill,\" he adds.\n\n\u2022 Treat your stress before it ruins your trip. Holiday travel is stressful, says wellness coach David Nico. Take steps to prevent it. His favorite: peppermint oil, a therapeutic herb used in a variety of digestive conditions. \"Peppermint oil decreases bloating and nausea associated with gastrointestinal disturbances,\" he says. When the flight attendant asks what you want to drink, go for the peppermint tea.\n\n\u2022 Make multiple reservations. Both hotels and car rental companies allow you to make multiple reservations, often for the same day. Clement Zhang, the managing director of FindOptimal, a site that helps travelers save money by exploiting that ability, says that can save you serious money. \"Because hotel rates often vary from night to night, you may save hundreds of dollars by breaking one reservation into two or three,\" he says. \"But you'll get the same hotel rooms and the same service.\"\n\nChristopher Elliott is a consumer advocate.

Spinning away from the goal, the French striker used his right foot to cushion a forward lob by Luka Modric. He then continued his turn and coolly slotted the ball in.\n\nAfter he went close by hitting the crossbar, Benzema helped produce a second goal for the visitors in the 56th. Benzema dribbled past a marker and fired a shot that ricocheted off goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez, a post, and Celta defender Gustavo Cabral before finally going in.\n\nHugo Mallo pulled one back for Celta and Iago Aspas forced goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to get low to parry his shot before Sergio Ramos put the result beyond doubt in the 83rd. Ramos scored from the spot by softly chipping his penalty down the middle after David Junca fouled Alvaro Odriozola.\n\nCelta finished with 10 men after Cabral was shown a second yellow card in the 87th.\n\nDani Ceballos then added a fourth goal for Madrid from long range before Brais Mendez scored Celta's second.\n\nSolari has coached Madrid to four wins since he was named caretaker coach following the firing of Julen Lopetegui. The club was looking for a permanent replacement, but Solari may have convinced Madrid that he should stay on.\n\nSolari refused to talk about his future after the win, saying \"the important thing is to do what is right for the club.\"\n\nMadrid was also reticent.\n\n\"What I can say is that we are very happy (with Solari),\" club spokesman Emilio Butragueno said.\n\nMadrid remained in sixth place, but closed to within four points of leader Barcelona, which lost 4-3 to Real Betis.\n\nMadrid was already without injured defenders Marcelo, Raphael Varane and Dani Carvajal. It lost three more players to injuries during the game at Bailados Stadium, including midfielder Casemiro, who hurt his right leg in a run-in with Celta's Maxi Gomez.\n\nSolari also said that Gareth Bale played the second half with a swollen ankle.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bush and know from first-hand experience that he embodies the ideals crucial to running the Justice Department effectively.\n\nFirst and foremost, Matt prioritizes the impartial application of the law. Some critics of Matt have deemed him partisan, claiming he would be unable to maintain an impartial view of the investigations surrounding President Donald Trump. But the fact is that as political appointees, few U.S. attorneys are strangers to politics. Many have previously been candidates or are destined to be candidates in the future.\n\nThe job of a federal prosecutor is not to be blind to politics, but to ensure that when it comes to individual investigations or prosecutions, only two things can drive decisions: the facts and the law. Not politics. Not partisanship.\n\nOur view: Here are 5 reasons why Matthew Whitaker isn't attorney general material\n\nLike Jeff Sessions before him, Matt is an experienced prosecutor. Indeed, while people seem to fear a deep rupture in the Justice Department during Matt\u2019s leadership, it\u2019s important to recognize that some of his most impressive credentials are in line with his predecessors\u2019 priorities.\n\nWhen Matt was U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Iowa from 2004 to 2009, he prosecuted thousands of cases involving drug dealers and violent felons. And like Sessions, Matt recognizes the importance of securing our borders, having prosecuted hundreds of illegal immigrants, as well as the masterminds behind a scheme to undermine America\u2019s visa system. He understands the importance of government accountability and transparency, which is why he pursued government contractors who defrauded taxpayers.\n\nI suspect one reason the news media distrust Matt is simply because he hasn\u2019t been a D.C. fixture. He\u2019s a proud Iowan who earned three degrees from the University of Iowa (and even started for the Hawkeyes\u2019 1991 Rose Bowl team). In other words, he\u2019s not from the swamp. Matt is eminently qualified to serve as acting attorney general.\n\nBud Cummins served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas from 2001 to 2006.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/11/matthew-whitaker-excellent-choice-acting-attorney-general-debates-editorials/1970170002/", "CLOSE Matthew Whitaker was previous Jeff Sessions' chief of staff. Sessions submitted his resignation on Wednesday, one day after the 2018 midterm elections. USA TODAY\n\nTrump loyalist lacks ethical compass. Whitaker will likely try to curb Mueller's inquiry: Our view.\n\nU.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker speaks during a news conference as James Vandenberg, Office of Inspector General for the Dept. of Labor, left, and Iowa state Auditor David Vaudt, right, look on Jan. 16, 2007, in Des Moines, Iowa. President Donald Trump named Whitaker acting attorney general Wednesday, after Jeff Sessions resigned. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall, AP)\n\nThe more we learn about Matthew Whitaker, the less he looks like attorney general material, or even acting attorney general material.\n\nFrom the moment Whitaker was tapped last week to replace Jeff Sessions, who was forced out, it seemed his chief qualification was open hostility to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 a view shared by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn his new position, Whitaker oversees the investigation whose completion is critical to the nation. It's unclear whether his appointment was even constitutional, or how long he'll serve in the post. But even one day is too many. In addition to his skepticism about Mueller's inquiry, Whitaker has repeatedly shown he lacks the ethical compass and respect for the rule of law that's the most basic qualification to lead the nation's premier law enforcement agency:\n\n\u25ba He has said there was nothing wrong with top Trump campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., meeting with Russians who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton. \"You would always take that meeting,\" Whitaker told CNN last year. Really? Common sense and patriotism suggest that in the middle of a presidential campaign, you don't take a meeting with Russians bearing dirt. You call the FBI.\n\n\u25ba He asserted it wasn\u2019t a problem last year when Trump \u2014 sounding more like mob boss than a president \u2014 sought fealty from then FBI director James Comey and asked him to go easy on Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and then fired Comey.\n\nOpposing view: Matthew Whitaker is an excellent choice to lead Justice Department\n\n\u25ba He believes judges should have a \"biblical view of justice,\" as opposed to \"a secular world view\" \u2014 a comment he made when he was seeking a seat in the Senate, where he\u2019d vote on the confirmation of federal judges. In fact, judges should rule independently based on the law, not on personal religious beliefs.\n\n\u25ba He said courts are \"supposed to be the inferior branch\" of government, and among the worst Supreme Court rulings was Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 landmark decision that's the foundation of the court\u2019s authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws.\n\n\u25ba He sat on the advisory board of a Florida patent company accused in a Federal Trade Commission complaint, later settled, of bilking customers, including veterans. In 2015, Whitaker wrote a threatening letter to a complaining customer, noting his former role as U.S. Attorney in Iowa. That powerful office isn't meant to be used to frighten people for private purposes.\n\nAs these details emerged after Whitaker's appointment, Trump seemingly tried to distance himself from the choice. After telling Fox News last month, \"I know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump reversed himself Friday, declaring, \"I don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker\" except by reputation. Then, on Sunday, the president expressed \"100 percent confidence\" in Whitaker, according to aide Kellyanne Conway.\n\nNormally, when an attorney general leaves, the acting job falls to the deputy attorney general or another Senate-confirmed appointee. Here, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has overseen the Mueller investigation and shown no inclination to shut it down, was a nonstarter for Trump. That speaks volumes about Trump's intentions.\n\nIf Whitaker refuses to recuse himself from the Mueller inquiry or step aside altogether, only Congress and the public can ensure that he does not damage the Mueller investigation and the integrity of the Justice Department.\n\nWhen the lame-duck Congress returns to Washington this week, the first order of business should be to pass legislation, approved last April with bipartisan support by the Senate Judiciary Committee, to protect the special counsel.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell continues to insist such legislation is unnecessary because of Trump's assurances that the investigation will be allowed to run its course. Maybe McConnell believes that Trump's word is his bond; the rest of us have reason to be highly skeptical.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

(Nov. 11) AP\n\nSmoke clouds the air above the remains of a burned-out house and car in Paradise, California, following the Camp Fire devastation. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nThe images and stories from the wildfires raging in Northern and Southern California present a picture of a rampaging inferno spreading at dizzying speed.\n\nThe numbers behind those hellish scenes are just as somber.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far about the devastation inflicted upon the country\u2019s most populous state.\n\nHow many fires are burning?\n\nThere are six wildfires, three of them considered major, currently sizzling throughout the state.\n\nThe largest one is the Camp Fire in Butte County, north of the capital city of Sacramento, which has become the most destructive fire in state history, leveling more than 6,700 structures.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection \u2013 better known as Cal Fire \u2013 reported that this blaze has charred 109,000 acres and is only 25 percent contained. Full containment is not expected until the final day of the month.\n\nThe Camp Fire\u2019s impact has been felt all the way to the San Francisco Bay Area, more than 150 miles away, with smoky air blanketing the region over the weekend.\n\nTo the south in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, the Woolsey Fire has brought an extra layer of grief to an area stunned by Wednesday\u2019s mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill, which left 13 people dead, including the gunman. This blaze has scorched more than 83,000 acres and is just 10 percent contained.\n\nThe Hill Fire, also in Ventura County north of Malibu, has burned 4,500 acres and is 70 percent contained.\n\nHow damaging have they been?\n\nTo get a sense for the devastation inflicted by the Camp Fire, which wiped away the town of Paradise, consider that last year\u2019s Tubbs Fire \u2013 the most harmful of the Wine Country fires that took about three weeks to extinguish \u2013 destroyed 5,636 structures, by far the most in state history.\n\nIt took three days for the Camp Fire to surpass that total. Of the 6,713 structures it has obliterated, 6,453 were residences.\n\nMore significantly, the Camp Fire has accounted for 29 fatalities \u2013 many of them people killed in their cars \u2013 matching the deadliest wildfire in state history. The figure stood at 23 until Sunday evening, when authorities announced six more bodies had been found. Along with two deaths from the Woolsey Fire, the total from the two largest active blazes stands at 31 fatalities, and it's likely to rise.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire has destroyed 177 structures, and it has combined with the nearby Hill Fire to force the displacement of 250,000 people, among them celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Cher, Martin Sheen, Kim Kardashian West, Alyssa Milano and movie director Guillermo del Toro.\n\nWhy have these fires erupted so quickly?\n\nForecasters warned in the middle of last week that conditions were ripe for fires to ignite because lack of rainfall and warm weather had left vegetation bone dry, and increasing winds added to the likelihood the blazes would spread quickly.\n\nSoon after, the Camp Fire \u2013 named after Camp Creek Road, where it started \u2013 made good on those predictions, flaring up Thursday morning and expanding at an astonishing rate. The Woolsey and Hill fires were sparked that day as well.\n\nPresident Trump inserted an element of controversy into the tragedies when he tweeted Saturday that \u201cgross mismanagement of the forests\u2019\u2019 was to blame for the fires and threatened to withhold funding.\n\nCalifornia officials have maintained that higher-than-normal temperatures \u2013 likely caused by climate change \u2013 have sucked the humidity out of grass, shrubs and trees, providing fuel for blazes to burn quicker and more intensely.\n\nWeather experts largely agree, although they also point out rural development adds to the human danger when fires are set off.\n\nWhat do conditions look like today?\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued Red Flag warnings until Monday morning for vast swaths of Northern California, covering most of the central part of that region from Sacramento north to the Shasta National Forest and east to the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n\nThose warnings, which indicate critical to extreme fire conditions, were also issued for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Tuesday afternoon because of the combination of 40-60-mph wind gusts and humidity levels in single digits.\n\n\u201cToday is a critical fire-weather day,\u2019\u2019 meteorologist Alex Hoon said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of shifting winds, dry conditions.\u2019\u2019\n\nHow to help\n\nWith thousands of homes destroyed and at least 31 killed, the people of California could use extra support.\n\nHere are a few organizations where you can donate or volunteer your time to help out those affected by the disaster.\n\nCalifornia Volunteers: The state-run office manages programs and initiatives helping to increase public service in California. The group has activated for the disasters and has ways for you to help out, whether it be financially, volunteering or with donated goods, in each of the fires.\n\nAmerican Red Cross: The American Red Cross is providing assistance and helping the affected parties find shelter.

While SPIRE (which doesn\u2019t compete in an official high school governing body) cleared LaMelo, opponents are already dropping out of their scheduled games against SPIRE.\n\nShortly after Ball\u2019s announcement that the was returning to high school, famed Indiana powerhouse La Lumiere canceled its Tuesday game against SPIRE. La Lumiere has produced players like Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan\u2019s Jordan Poole and current five-star prospect Keion Brooks.

That hope took another hit when Oak Hill Academy (Va.) dropped out of its Dec. 3 game against SPIRE.\n\nOak Hill is led by Cole Anthony \u2014 a top 3 player in the class of 2019 \u2014 but the school was not willing to play the game against SPIRE if LaMelo was on the court. According to head coach Steve Smith, LaMelo playing in the game \u2014 even if he didn\u2019t get paid as a professional, which is dubious because he signed a contract \u2014 would have jeopardized his entire team\u2019s eligibility in the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association (VISAA).\n\nHe told the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cI just told them, \u2018We can\u2019t jeopardize our school and our association and our affiliation with conferences,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey understood. I said we can play them if [Ball] doesn\u2019t play, but they weren\u2019t willing to do that.\u201d\n\nVISAA guidelines require its members to only play non-conference schools that adhere to VISAA eligibility rules (Section 7). LaMelo\u2019s questionable eligibility for high school athletics was too much of a risk for Oak Hill.\n\nStill, there are some schools willing to take on LaMelo and SPIRE. In fact, LaMelo\u2019s high school career started Saturday in a game against the Hill School in Pennsylvania. LaMelo scored 20 points and added 13 assists.\n\nSPIRE won the game.", "IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Iowa's offense struggled with turnovers early on, but thanks to its determination to feed the post, the Hawkeyes dominated down low in a 93-82 win over Green Bay on Sunday.\n\nLuka Garza and Tyler Cook muscled Phoenix defenders in the paint all game long, as each scored 17 points.\n\n\"Early on we were getting (the ball) to me inside, then we started getting it to Cook, because we knew we had the advantage there,\" Garza said. \"They couldn't stop us.\"\n\nForwards Garza, Cook, Nicholas Baer, and Ryan Kriener combined to score 54 points, but it was also Jordan Bohannon's play on the outside that sparked Iowa's second-half breakaway.\n\nConnor McCaffery's presence at point guard allowed Bohannon to slide over from point to shooting guard, freeing him from primary ball-handling duties and giving him more looks from long-range.\n\nBohannon scored all 13 of his points in the second half, hitting three of his six 3-point attempts.\n\n\"I think it helped me get some shots off, especially with them pressing the entire game,\" he said. \"I wasn't really too aggressive - I don't think it was needed for me to be aggressive in the first half. I just let the game come to me.\"\n\nThanks to early foul trouble on Cook's end and Bohannon's 0-for-2 performance in the first half, the Phoenix held both players to just 3 points combined in the opening half. They scored 27 in the second half.\n\nMeanwhile, Green Bay hung around thanks to the hot hands of Sandy Cohen III and Manny Patterson. Both scored 17 points, with Cohen added eight assists and six rebounds in his 37 minutes on the court.\n\nThe Phoenix forced 17 turnovers, sparking an early first-half lead. Green Bay fell into foul trouble as the game went on, however, as Iowa shot 45 free throws.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nGreen Bay: The Phoenix defense made the Hawkeyes uncomfortable for most of the game, forcing 17 turnovers. That's one turnover better than their last game, and also something head coach Linc Darner should be pleased with.\n\nIowa: Defense was Iowa's Achilles' heel last season and it showed again. It's early, but giving up 82 points isn't ideal for a team that made defense an offseason priority.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nWith less than six minutes remaining in the game, Bohannon stole a Green Bay pass, and the Phoenix failed to stop the ball. The Hawkeye point guard drove to the bucket and made a layup through a foul.

While SPIRE (which doesn\u2019t compete in an official high school governing body) cleared LaMelo, opponents are already dropping out of their scheduled games against SPIRE.\n\nShortly after Ball\u2019s announcement that the was returning to high school, famed Indiana powerhouse La Lumiere canceled its Tuesday game against SPIRE. La Lumiere has produced players like Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan\u2019s Jordan Poole and current five-star prospect Keion Brooks.

That hope took another hit when Oak Hill Academy (Va.) dropped out of its Dec. 3 game against SPIRE.\n\nOak Hill is led by Cole Anthony \u2014 a top 3 player in the class of 2019 \u2014 but the school was not willing to play the game against SPIRE if LaMelo was on the court. According to head coach Steve Smith, LaMelo playing in the game \u2014 even if he didn\u2019t get paid as a professional, which is dubious because he signed a contract \u2014 would have jeopardized his entire team\u2019s eligibility in the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association (VISAA).\n\nHe told the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cI just told them, \u2018We can\u2019t jeopardize our school and our association and our affiliation with conferences,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey understood. I said we can play them if [Ball] doesn\u2019t play, but they weren\u2019t willing to do that.\u201d\n\nVISAA guidelines require its members to only play non-conference schools that adhere to VISAA eligibility rules (Section 7). LaMelo\u2019s questionable eligibility for high school athletics was too much of a risk for Oak Hill.\n\nStill, there are some schools willing to take on LaMelo and SPIRE.

The sophomore was 7-of-10 with 15 points at the half.\n\nDespite several double-digit leads, Drexel was able to hang around before Rutgers began to run away with the game eight minutes into the second half. By midway through the second half, Rutgers led 78-52 thanks to a 23-4 run. With just under five minutes to play the run was at 33-5 with the score 88-53 after an Omoruyi 3-pointer.\n\nIt was one of four 3-pointers by Omoruyi in the newly added facet of his game.

USA TODAY\n\nTennessee Titans running back Dion Lewis (33) laterals the ball to wide receiver Darius Jennings (15) during the second half against the New England Patriots at Nissan Stadium. (Photo: Jim Brown, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe New England Patriots posted their biggest losing deficit of the season.\n\nAnd because it came against some familiar faces, there was plenty of swagger from the other side after the game.\n\nThe Mike Vrabel-led Tennessee Titans smothered New England in a 34-10 win. That effort included several former Patriots, including cornerbacks Logan Ryan and Malcolm Butler and running back Dion Lewis, with the latter two signing with the Titans this past offseason.\n\n\u201cHell yeah it\u2019s personal,\u201d Lewis said after the game, according to the NFL Network. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you go cheap. You get your (expletive) kicked.\u201d\n\nThroughout the game, cameras caught Lewis engaged in trash talk with several of his former teammates.\n\nButler tried to downplay any revenge, saying that the victory was the same as any other, but when pressed on whether he\u2019d be smiling wider because it came against his former team, he said \u201cmost definitely.\u201d\n\nThere was even some back-and-forth with the two teams' play-calling.\n\nOn a third-and-7 with 11:41 left in the game and the Patriots looking for a spark on offense, coordinator Josh McDaniels called a reverse pass play, the same one he dialed up in the Super Bowl LII loss against the Eagles. Against Philadelphia, quarterback Tom Brady dropped the pass. On Sunday, Brady caught it but almost immediately stumbled and fell to the ground after gaining 6 yards.\n\nOn the next play, an offensive lineman was called for a false start. The Patriots didn\u2019t convert the fourth-and-6.\n\nThen, after Tennessee took over the ball, the Titans called the same reverse pass on the very next play. Titans receiver Darius Jennings floated a pass to quarterback Marcus Mariota for 21 yards.\n\nSaid Vrabel after the game: \u201cI wanted to see if it looked any better than theirs.\u201d\n\nThe Pats tied their season low in points, converted just three of 15 third-down attempts and rushed for only 40 yards. Brady was also benched late in the fourth quarter.\n\nVrabel, a former Patriots linebacker who was a teammate of Brady\u2019s from 2001-08, and defensive coordinator Dean Pees \u2013 who held the same title with the Patriots from 2006-09 \u2013 schemed up an effective plan to pressure Brady up the middle. Tennessee sacked Brady three times and hit him another six.\n\nBrady completed just 21 of 41 passes for 254 yards.\n\n\u201cThey were better than we were in that area,\u201d Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. \u201cAs well as in a lot of other ones.\u201d\n\nOn defense, it wasn\u2019t much better.\n\nCornerback Stephon Gilmore, who had played well this season and had often shadowed opposing receivers, was routinely beaten by Titans wideout Corey Davis, who caught seven passes for 125 yards and one score.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really do much of anything well today,\u201d Belichick said after the game. \u201cEverything was a problem.\u201d\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "FILE - In this Sunday, Oct. 14, 2018 file photo, Miami Heat player Dwyane Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union-Wade acknowledge the cheers from the crowd during the second half of an NFL football game between the Miami Dolphins and the Chicago Bears in Miami Gardens, Fla.

Wade and his wife, actress Gabrielle Union-Wade, had the baby via a surrogate last week.\n\nThe couple and their baby are now at their Los Angeles home, and Wade said all are doing well. The baby's name has not been publicly released.\n\n\"With my daughter coming a couple weeks early, she's a little tiny right now, so we're making sure health-wise that she's OK,\" Wade said. \"And for me, once I leave and go back to the season, not really being able to be with me everywhere I go, this time right now, this bonding moment with my daughter is the most important thing in my life at this time.\"\n\nWade will miss, at minimum, upcoming Heat games against Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Indiana and the Los Angeles Lakers. He has also missed Miami's last three games.\n\n\"And then I'll go from there, see how she's doing and make a decision based on that,\" Wade said.\n\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra said the team remains committed to giving Wade all the time he needs.\n\n\"We're totally fine with it,\" Spoelstra said Sunday.\n\nWade released a video in September announcing he was coming back for one final season. At one point on that tape, Wade had tears in his eyes when he told fans they were not fully aware of everything that went into his decision to either come back or retire.\n\n\"There's a lot of things that you guys don't know that we deal with and I have dealt with this summer,\" Wade said on the tape.\n\nIt's clear now what he meant.\n\nUnion-Wade has spoken often about her struggles on the road to motherhood. In her memoir published last year, \"We're Gonna Need More Wine,\" Union-Wade revealed that she's had \"eight or nine\" miscarriages. The Wades ultimately decided to conceive via a surrogate.\n\n\"We had to go through a lot to get here,\" Wade said. \"Everyone knows that a little girl steals your heart.\"\n\nWade was strongly considering retirement, not because he no longer wanted to play but because he knew he and his wife were having a daughter and he was unsure if he wanted to be away from her for extended periods.\n\n\"Our situation is different,\" Wade said. \"The world expects moms to take time off from work. They never expect dads to be the ones who take time away. Because of the route we took to this, it's important that not also my wife but also me take this time. I was going to take the whole year. I was going to retire this summer. But I decided to just take a little time in between instead.\"\n\nThere is no mention of paternity leave in the NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement, so players and teams to work out such situations on their own. Major League Baseball is the only one of the four U.S. major pro leagues to have an official paternity policy, one that allows players to take up to three days.\n\nExtended absences by fathers are rare. New Orleans' Jrue Holiday missed the Pelicans' first 12 games two seasons ago to help care for his wife, former U.S. women's national soccer team player Lauren Holiday, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor while she was pregnant with their daughter.\n\n\"My family comes before basketball,\" Holiday said then.\n\nGolfer Hunter Mahan was leading a PGA Tour event in 2013 when he left because his first child was arriving early. Daniel Murphy, then of the New York Mets, took sports-radio criticism in 2014 when he missed two days after his son's birth. Al Horford of the Boston Celtics was criticized by some after missing a 2016 game \u2014 with his team's permission \u2014 for a baby's arrival.\n\nAnd backlash now seems less common. Players from England, Switzerland and Denmark were allowed to leave the World Cup in Russia earlier this year to be home for births. U.S. tennis star John Isner opted out of the Davis Cup semifinals in September because his wife's due date was nearing, and did so with plenty of support.\n\n\"My focus is my family and right now she is the most important person for me to focus on, and my boys understand that,\" Wade said. \"My heart is full, man.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Mayfield completed his first 13 passes and finished 17 of 20 for 216 yards. He threw a 28-yard scoring pass to Rashard Higgins, a 13-yarder to Chubb, and 11-yarder to Duke Johnson.\n\nRyan and the Falcons (4-5) had their three-game winning streak \u2014 and any playoff momentum \u2014 stopped cold.\n\nAnd while Mayfield did damage, Chubb's record run was the backbreaker.\n\nWith the Browns backed up at their 8, Chubb, who had 176 yards on 20 carries, took a handoff and headed right. He cut toward Atlanta's sideline, picked up a block and then showed his surprising breakaway speed while finishing the longest run in team history. Chubb's run broke the previous team mark held by Bobby Mitchell, who had a 90-yard TD run against Washington on Nov. 15, 1959.\n\nBEARS 34, LIONS 22\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Mitchell Trubisky threw for 355 yards and three touchdowns, and the NFC North-leading Bears snapped a 10-game losing streak against division opponents.\n\nThe Bears (6-3) had dropped nine of 10 against Detroit (3-6) and were seeking their first victory over a division opponent since Oct. 31, 2016, against Minnesota.\n\nChicago jumped to a 26-7 halftime lead with Trubisky and Allen Robinson leading the way. And the Bears surpassed their win total from last year with their third straight victory.\n\nTrubisky completed 23 of 30 passes against a short-handed secondary, with standout cornerback Darius Slay sidelined by a knee injury.\n\nAllen Robinson caught six passes for 133 yards and two TDs after missing two games with a groin injury.\n\nRookie Anthony Miller added a career-high 122 yards on five receptions, including a 45-yard TD and a 55-yard catch.\n\nKhalil Mack had two of Chicago's six sacks against Matthew Stafford \u2014 both in the second half after missing back-to-back games with an injured right ankle.\n\nREDSKINS 16, BUCCANEERS 3\n\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Alex Smith threw for 178 yards and one touchdown, and Dustin Hopkins kicked three field goals for the Redskins (6-3), who forced four turnovers and rebounded from a lopsided loss to Atlanta despite playing with a makeshift offensive line because of mounting injuries.\n\nSmith, who was 19 of 27 with no interceptions, threw 6 yards to Josh Doctson for the game's only touchdown early in the fourth quarter. Hopkins kicked field goals of 43, 43 and 26 yards, the last set up by Greg Stroman's fourth-quarter interception and 24-yard return to the Bucs 14.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick threw for 403 yards for Tampa Bay (3-6), but was intercepted twice and lost a fumble on a sack inside the Washington 10.\n\nThe Bucs, who've lost three in a row and six of seven following a 2-0 start, failed to force a turnover on defense for the sixth straight game.\n\nThe Redskins were outgained 279 yards to 136 in the first two quarters, yet led 6-3 at halftime after getting two field goals from Hopkins.\n\nCOLTS 29, JAGUARS 26\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Andrew Luck threw three touchdown passes in the first half and the Colts' defense forced a late turnover. Indy (4-5) has won three straight.\n\nTight end Eric Ebron had a career-high three touchdowns, including one on a 2-yard run, all in the first half.\n\nBlake Bortles threw for 319 yards and two TDs, but the Jaguars (3-6) came up short when Kenny Moore III stripped the ball from Rashad Greene Sr. and Malik Hooker recovered for the Colts with 1:24 to go. Initially, Greene was ruled down by contact, but it was overturned on a replay review from the booth.\n\nJacksonville, last year's AFC runner-up, has lost five straight and six of seven since starting 2-0.\n\nLuck took full advantage of mismatches in the first half as the Jaguars struggled to cover Indy's tight ends.\n\nEbron, Jack Doyle and Mo Alie-Cox teamed up to catch eight passes for 133 yards and all three scores. Luck wound up 21 of 29 with 285 yards and one interception but avoided being sacked for the fourth consecutive game \u2014 the longest stretch of his pro career.\n\nBILLS 41, JETS 10\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Matt Barkley stunningly sparked Buffalo's bumbling offense with two touchdown passes, including one to offensive tackle Dion Dawkins. LeSean McCoy broke out of a season-long slump with 113 yards rushing and a pair of TD runs.\n\nBarkley made his first start in nearly two years, and looked the best of any of the four quarterbacks the Bills (3-7) have trotted out this season. The 28-year-old journeyman was 15 of 25 for 232 yards while helping Buffalo snap a four-game losing streak as the Bills put up 451 yards of total offense.\n\nBarkley got the nod from coach Sean McDermott ahead of the ineffective Nathan Peterman despite having just two weeks of practice with the Bills since signing on Oct. 30. Rookie Josh Allen has missed four straight games with a sprained right elbow, and Derek Anderson is sidelined with a concussion. Barkley's last start came in the 2016 season finale for Chicago.\n\nMeanwhile, the hot seat under coach Todd Bowles has reached a boiling point as the Jets (3-7) got completely manhandled by a team that entered with a league-low 96 points and had two touchdowns in its previous four games.\n\nThe Jets have a bye-week break and the future of Bowles, in his fourth season, is in serious doubt.\n\nNew York started 39-year-old Josh McCown in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold, but he couldn't prevent the Jets from their fourth straight loss in front of a frustrated fan base that booed lustily throughout.\n\nMcCown was 17 of 34 for 135 yards with two interceptions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Then back to the U.S.A.\"\n\nBack in Washington, D.C., members of the incoming House Democratic majority served notice that they will vigorously investigate various aspects of his administration, including last week's appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who will likely chair the House Judiciary Committee when Democrats take over in January, said Whitaker's past attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller suggest he might try to shut down the investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election.\n\nSaying he wants to summon Whitaker before his committee, Nadler told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that \"the very first thing\" he wants to do is \"to protect the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nMore: Charles Schumer says Democrats might tie spending bill to Mueller protection\n\nMore: President Trump honors the dead of World War I \u2013 and avoids politics\n\nTrump must also decide whether to appoint Whitaker full time to succeed fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, or find someone new. Either way, the nomination of a new attorney general will likely generate difficult Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nThe Paris trip just days after Election Day, on which Democrats won control of the House while Republicans held onto the Senate.\n\nAs Trump landed Sunday back in Washington, he also faced other potential political headaches, Among them:\n\nWhat is Mueller going to do?\n\nTrump advisers like attorney Rudy Giuliani expect the special counsel to issue some kind of report soon on his findings in the Russia case. But no one knows for sure, especially with all the upheaval at the Justice Department.\n\nTrump has denied any sort of collusion with Russians who sought to influence the 2016 campaign by hacking Democrats and pushing fake news. The president has repeatedly denounced the investigation as a hoax.\n\nThe hush money case\n\nWhile Trump was in Paris, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in New York has gathered evidence of Trump\u2019s participation in the pre-election payment of hush money to women who claimed to have had affairs with him.\n\nThe payments, designed to keep the women quiet, were not reported by the Trump campaign, and therefore could constitute violations of campaign finance laws. Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nNadler also expressed interest in whether Trump knew about hush money, telling CNN \"that might very well be an impeachable offense.\"\n\nHow far to push on immigration\n\nBefore leaving Washington last week, Trump signed an order seeking to restrict asylum claims for migrants. It is being challenged in court.\n\nTrump, who made attacks on caravans of Central American migrants a key part of his campaign for Republican congressional candidates, must now decide whether to act on other proposals he tossed out on the campaign trail.\n\nThat includes his call to end birthright citizenship. That kind of move would also be challenged in court.\n\nWhat to do about Saudi Arabia\n\nDuring his trip to Paris, Trump spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Hours before, Erdogan had said he provided the United States and other countries with audio tapes demonstrating Saudi complicity in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nTrump must eventually say whether he believes the Saudis are guilty, and whether he will put sanctions on his Middle East ally.\n\nThe president also faces a number of other foreign policy challenges when he returns to the White House, including Iran, Syria, and North Korea.\n\nGiven his ceremonial obligations, Trump did little policy work in Paris, though he did have a one-on-one meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nStill, his foreign policy philosophy did come up during a ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I.\n\nMacron, who has criticized Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy, appeared to reference the U.S. president as he used his speech to decry excessive \"nationalism\" at the root of the First World War and succeeding conflicts.\n\n\"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" Macron told a gathering of world leaders that ranged from Russian President Vladimir Putin to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as Trump.\n\n\u201cNationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying, \u2018our interest first, who cares about the others?\u2019\"\n\nTrump did not respond to Macron, at least publicly.\n\nDuring his speech at the cemetery, Trump thanked Macron for inviting him to the armistice centennial.\n\n\"It was very beautiful and so well done,\" Trump said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/11/donald-trump-returns-paris/1957638002/", "West Virginia quarterback Will Grier (7) celebrate a touchdown during the first half of an NCAA college football game against TCU, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Morgantown, W.Va. (AP Photo/Raymond Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 No. 7 West Virginia's mini-payback tour is off to a good start as the Mountaineers try to secure a spot in the Big 12 championship game.\n\nAfter a lopsided win over TCU , West Virginia has showdowns remaining against Oklahoma State and No. 6 Oklahoma. The Mountaineers (8-1, 6-1, No. 9 CFP) lost to all three teams a year ago. Oklahoma is the only Big 12 opponent the Mountaineers haven't beaten since joining the league in 2012.\n\nTheir final road game is Saturday against the Cowboys, who dominated West Virginia 50-39 a year ago in Morgantown.\n\n\"They came here and embarrassed us last year, so we have redemption on our mind,\" said West Virginia defensive coordinator Tony Gibson.\n\nWest Virginia has played well on both sides of the ball ever since its only loss Oct. 13 at Iowa State and quarterback Will Grier has re-emerged as a Heisman Trophy hopeful.\n\n\"Getting your tail beat in kind of opens up everybody's eyes a little bit,\" said West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen. \"We weren't going to let that define us. We've been pretty good since.\"\n\nAfter struggling at times this season to shut down opponents and fill gaps at linebacker created by injuries, Gibson's unit has allowed 14 points or less in two of the last three games.\n\nAlthough Texas moved the ball well two weeks ago, West Virginia's defense held on just enough to force the Longhorns to kick two field goals in the second half and enable Grier to provide the decisive push in the 42-41 victory.\n\nWest Virginia handed TCU's Gary Patterson his most lopsided loss in 18 seasons as head coach. The Mountaineers limited the Horned Frogs to a season-low 222 yards of offense, including minus-7 yards rushing, and forced a safety in the 47-10 win.\n\n\"We knew the schedule of the month of November,\" Gibson said. \"We've prepared and built ourselves up to be able to stop these kind of offenses, and now we're going to get tested the next few weeks.\"\n\nNext stop: Stillwater, Oklahoma, where Holgorsen had a 10-month stint as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under Oklahoma State's Mike Gundy in 2010 before moving to West Virginia in December of that year.\n\n\"Next week's going to be a huge challenge,\" Holgorsen said Saturday before heading off to watch the Cowboys lose at Oklahoma 48-47.\n\nOklahoma State and Oklahoma will see some new offensive twists. The Mountaineers haven't thrown this often to their tight ends since Anthony Becht caught 35 passes in 1999. Grier also is turning to his running backs more as receiving targets if he can't throw downfield.\n\nTight end Trevon Wesco, who caught one pass all last season, and Miami transfer Jovani Haskins have combined for 31 catches for 367 yards and two scores. The 270-pound Wesco had five catches for a team-high 86 yards, including a 32-yard score, against TCU.\n\n\"The more he plays and the more we scheme things up for him, the better he is,\" Holgorsen. \"He's a big part of what we're doing. I've seen this coming for quite a while.\"\n\nThe biggest game on the schedule is the one the Mountaineers haven't talked about yet \u2014 a home matchup at night with co-leader Oklahoma the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nWin the next two, West Virginia will earn a spot in the Dec. 1 league title game in Arlington, Texas. Win that game, there's an outside chance it a spot could open for the Mountaineers in the College Football Playoff, although other teams higher than them would have to lose. Even that might not be enough.\n\n\"We know we have a lot in front of us to accomplish,\" said West Virginia linebacker David Long. \"For us to accomplish that, as a football team we're going to have to be better each week. No pressure, man. We've just got to go out there and play football.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

There\u2019s going to be a lot of shifting winds, dry conditions.\"\n\nWinds and heavy smoke have severely limited the amount of time air tankers have been able to fight the fire, which is responsible for at least 23 deaths and the destruction of at least 6,543 homes and hundreds of businesses and other commercial structures in the 27,000-resident mountain town of Paradise, which has largely been destroyed.\n\nThe fire has sent a massive plume of smoke across Northern California, limiting visibility and forcing many residents to remain indoors.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/11/california-fires-global-supertanker-joins-fight-against-camp-fire/1970166002/", "Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford (9) gets tripped by Chicago Bears defensive tackle Bilal Nichols (98) during the second half of an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Chicago.

Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Mitchell Trubisky locked in right from the start, whether he was firing downfield or making the right read underneath the defense.\n\nIt added up to one of his best performances as a pro, not to mention a rare win for Chicago against Detroit and an NFC North rival.\n\nTrubisky threw for a career-high 355 yards and three touchdowns, and the first-place Bears beat the Lions 34-22 to snap a 10-game losing streak against division opponents on Sunday.\n\nThe Bears (6-3) had dropped nine of 10 against Detroit (3-6) and were seeking their first victory over a division opponent since Oct. 31, 2016, against Minnesota.\n\nChicago jumped out to a 26-7 halftime lead with Trubisky and Allen Robinson leading the way. And the Bears surpassed their win total from last year with their third straight victory .\n\n\"We were just out there having fun today,\" Trubisky said. \"Everyone was doing their job. We just went out there and played. And the plays made themselves because we were just going out there not thinking, just translating the work from practice on gameday.\"\n\nThough he threw for six touchdowns against Tampa Bay earlier this season, Trubisky had one of his best games since the Bears took him with the No. 2 pick in the 2017 draft.\n\nHe completed 23 of 30 passes and finished with a 148.6 rating. He also ran for a 4-yard touchdown.\n\n\"He's playing his tail off right now,\" coach Matt Nagy said. \"I love where he's at.\"\n\nAllen Robinson caught six passes for 133 yards and two TDs after missing two games with a groin injury.\n\nRookie Anthony Miller added a career-high 122 yards on five receptions, including a 45-yard TD and a 55-yard catch.\n\nKhalil Mack had two of Chicago's six sacks against Matthew Stafford \u2014 both in the second half after missing back-to-back games with an injured right ankle.\n\nBryce Callahan had a sack and an interception.\n\nAbout the only downer for the Bears was Cody Parkey hitting uprights while missing two extra points and two field goals.\n\nThings were so bad for him that fans cheered sarcastically when he made an extra point late in the first half and let out a loud roar when the Bears went for a 2-point conversion after a touchdown by Robinson in the third.\n\n\"Of course (coaches are) frustrated with me but who's more frustrated than myself?\" Parkey said. \"This is my job, this is what I'm supposed to do and I'm missing out there. So I mean I've just got to trust in what I'm doing.\"\n\nParkey's misses didn't stop the Bears from opening a three-game stretch against division opponents on a winning note.\n\nDetroit dropped its third in a row after back-to-back victories.\n\nStafford was consistently under pressure again after getting sacked 10 times against Minnesota the previous week. He was 25 of 42 for 274 yards, two touchdowns and a pair of interceptions.\n\n\"We're fighting, nobody can say we're not fighting until the very end,\" said running back Kerryon Johnson, who scored from the 1 near the end of the first half.\n\n\"Problem is we start off slow and then the fight at the end doesn't matter. We just have to come out, and get better at the beginning. Keep on doing what we're doing at the end and put it all together.\"\n\nSTRONG START\n\nTrubisky had a 158.3 rating at halftime after going 14 of 16 for 209 yards and two touchdowns with the Bears predominantly in a no-huddle offense.\n\nComing off a 41-9 romp at Buffalo, Chicago scored on its first four possessions to grab a 26-0 lead. Robinson set up Tarik Cohen's 3-yard touchdown on the game's opening drive when he turned a slant into a 35-yard gain, breaking a tackle by DeShawn Shead on a 35-yard slant. Parkey hit the right upright on the extra-point attempt. But the Bears kept rolling from there.\n\nKICKED OUT\n\nNagy insisted he still trusts Parkey and the Bears won't look to bring in another kicker.\n\n\"There's zero chance of that happening,\" he said.\n\nNagy also dismissed the idea of having Parkey practice at Soldier Field during the week, saying \"it's pretty windy up at Halas Hall\" in suburban Lake Forest, where the team is headquartered.\n\nINJURIES\n\nLions: TE Michael Roberts suffered a shoulder injury when he was tackled making a 9-yard catch early in the fourth quarter. ... WR Marvin Jones Jr. hurt a knee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLions: Host Carolina on Nov. 18.\n\nBears: Host Minnesota on Nov. 18.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Andrew Luck started Sunday by carving up Jacksonville's staunch defense.\n\nHe finished it by playing the eager spectator.\n\nAfter throwing three first-half touchdown passes and picking up only two first downs in the second half, he celebrated when the Indianapolis Colts' defense delivered the decisive turnover with 90 seconds left to preserve a 29-26 victory over the Jaguars.\n\n\"We played well enough in the first half to put some points on the board,\" Luck said. \"Then we survived.\"\n\nBarely survived, that is.\n\nTrailing by three, Jacksonville quickly marched from its 42-yard line into field goal range, and when Rashad Greene Sr. went down at the Colts' 23, it looked like the Jaguars were already set up for at least a tying field goal. Initially, Greene was ruled down before the ball squirted out.\n\nBut just before the Jags (3-6) ran the next play, the whistles blew for a booth review. A few minutes later, the call was overturned, giving the ball and the game to the Colts, who have won three straight for the first time in three years.\n\n\"I thought we got the play off, but obviously, we didn't,\" Jags coach Doug Marrone said before elaborating later. \"Personally, I thought it wasn't a fumble. But I see what everybody sees from the sideline.\"\n\nLast year's AFC runner-ups were a popular preseason pick to dethrone New England. Instead, the Jags have lost five straight, six of seven and are last in the division.\n\nAnd they don't get more painful than this.\n\nJacksonville had an extra point blocked and nearly returned for a 2-point conversion in the first half.\n\nTwo 15-yard penalties helped Indy score its fourth touchdown, a 1-yard pass from Luck to Mo Alie-Cox late in the second quarter. An offside call on the ensuing extra point prompted coach Frank Reich to go for two, which Marlon Mack punched it in to make it 29-13.\n\nJacksonville kicker Josh Lambo missed his first field goal of the season, a 52-yarder, wide left in the third quarter but then made a 55-yarder to cut the deficit to three with 4:03 left.\n\nFinally, Kenny Moore III sealed the Jags' fate by ripping the ball away from Greene just before his leg went down and Malik Hooker scooped it up.\n\n\"Offensively we're looking to improve, put that thing away,\" Reich said. \"But make no mistake about it: This was a huge win for us.\"\n\nLuck started fast, hooking up with Eric Ebron on a 53-yard TD pass seven plays into the game.\n\nAfter Donte Moncrief tied it on an 80-yard scoring play, Ebron answered with a 2-yard TD run to make it 14-7. Luck connected with Ebron again on a 12-yard TD pass, giving the tight end a career-high third score with 9:19 left in the first half.\n\nLuck finished 21 of 29 with 285 yards, one interception and was not sacked. He has three TD passes or more in six straight games, one of three QBs to do so in a single season. His company: Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.\n\nBlake Bortles was 26 of 38 with 320 yards and two TD passes while Leonard Fournette had 53 yards rushing, 56 yards receiving and his first two scores of the season \u2014 one on the ground, one through the air.\n\nIt just wasn't enough.\n\n\"It's a good defense, a lot of respect for that defense,\" Luck said. \"We certainly weren't sharp enough.\"\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nJaguars: Center Brandon Linder and offensive tackle Ereck Flowers both left in the third quarter with knee injuries.\n\nColts: Defensive end Carroll Phillips left in the first half with an injured groin. Defensive tackle Grover Stewart left with an injured ankle in the fourth quarter. Neither returned.\n\nAUTOMATIC ADAM\n\nThe Colts honored the NFL's new career scoring leader, Adam Vinatieri, before the game with a brief highlight film and the distinction of being the last starter introduced to the crowd, which roared.\n\nVinatieri responded by waving to the crowd and slapping hands with some fans on the field. Then he added three more points to his record-breaking total (2,553) before missing a 52-yard attempt wide right with 2:58 left in the game.\n\nHe also tied George Blanda for the most regular-season wins in league history (209).\n\nSTAT PACK\n\nJaguars: Fournette had 29 touches, 24 carries and five receptions, in his third game this season. ... Punter Logan Cooke completed a 4-yard pass on a fake field goal, which kept the Jags' 17-play drive alive to open the second half. The drive ended with Fournette's 1-yard TD catch.\n\nColts: Ebron finished with three catches for 69 yards. He is the second tight end with two receiving and one rushing TD in a single game in NFL history, matching Rob Gronkowki, who did it against Indy in 2011. ...

The good news for Presbyterian was the emergence of Stafford, who scored 12 of the Blue Hose's first 15 points while making her college debut at one of the most storied venues in women's basketball. She made all five of her 3-point attempts.\n\n\"I knew that I couldn't come in with fear, or they would see it and come at me,\" Stafford said.\n\nTennessee: Zaay Green continues to show she's ready to make an immediate contribution. The 6-foot freshman replaced Davis in the starting lineup and shot 3 of 4 from 3-point range and had four assists to go along with her 13 points.

(AP Photo/Mark LoMoglio) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Washington yielded 501 yards and forced Tampa Bay to punt once all day.\n\nSounds like a blueprint for a lopsided loss, yet there the Redskins were in the visiting locker room Sunday celebrating a 16-3 victory that kept them alone atop the NFC East.\n\nThat's what four takeaways, three of them foiling scoring opportunities, will do for a team that struggles to score points.\n\n\"We gave up some yards. They had great time of possession and some great drives, but we were able to keep them out of the end zone,\" coach Jay Gruden said. \"You've got to keep playing until the drives are over, and good things will happen. We did that.\"\n\nAlex Smith threw for 178 yards and one touchdown, while Dustin Hopkins kicked three field goals for the Redskins (6-3), who improved their turnover differential to plus-11 and rebounded from a 38-14 loss to Atlanta despite playing with a makeshift offensive line because of mounting injuries.\n\n\"I promise you this: If we were even or minus-11, we wouldn't be 6-3,\" Gruden said. \"It's been the difference so far. It's why we are where we are.\"\n\nSmith, who was 19 of 27 with no interceptions, threw 6 yards to Josh Doctson for the game's only touchdown early in the fourth quarter.\n\nHopkins kicked field goals of 43, 43 and 26 yards, the last set up by Greg Stroman's fourth-quarter interception and 24-yard return to the Bucs 14.\n\n\"You can (give up) 1,000 yards, but if you get the 'W,' three points, it really doesn't matter,\" Washington cornerback Josh Norman said. \"It goes down in the stat sheet, but the only stat that matters is the 'W.' \"\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick threw for 406 yards for Tampa Bay (3-6), but was intercepted twice and lost a fumble on a sack inside the Washington 10.\n\nThe Bucs, who have the NFL's top passing attack and are second in total offense, fell to 1-3 in games they've gained 500-plus yards this season.\n\nJust as discouraging for coach Dirk Koetter and his players: Tampa Bay, which has lost three in a row and six of seven following a 2-0 start, failed to force a turnover on defense for the sixth straight game.\n\n\"''Four-zero in turnover margin is going to kill you every time,\" Koetter said. \"We had a lot of chances. ... We weren't good enough today, and that's plain to see.\"\n\nMeanwhile, three of their four giveaways thwarted scoring opportunities, including Jacquizz Rodgers' fumble on a reception that rolled 18 yards into the Washington end zone, where it was recovered by safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix for a touchback.\n\nThe Redskins were outgained 279 yards to 136 in the first two quarters, yet led 6-3 at halftime after getting two field goals from Hopkins.\n\nThe Bucs moved into Redskins' territory on all five of their first-half possessions, but had little to show after Norman made a leaping interception on the goal line of a pass intended for Chris Godwin, and Chandler Catanzaro missed a 30-yard field goal.\n\nCatanzaro, who's missed four field goals and four extra points through nine games, also had a 47-yarder sail wide right early in the second half.\n\n\"I feel bad for my teammates. I'm just not performing well enough right now for this team,\" said Catanzaro, whose 33-yarder in the second quarter accounted for all of Tampa Bay scoring. \"Right now they're not going through (the uprights). I've done my best to fix it up until now and it hasn't been fixed.\"\n\nBIG NUMBERS\n\nFitzpatrick completed 29 of 41 passes and topped 400 yards passing for the fourth time this season. He was sacked twice.\n\nRodgers finished with eight receptions for 102 yards for Tampa Bay. Godwin had seven catches for 100 yards.\n\nINJURIES\n\nRedskins: With Trent Williams recovering from surgery on his right thumb, Ty Nsekhe started at left tackle along with guards Jonathan Cooper and Tony Bergstrom, replacements for Shawn Lauvao and Brandon Scherff, who were lost for the season against the Falcons.

Kunaiyi-Akpanah, who averaged just less than 12 rebounds per game last season, had 17 with 11 points. Jordan Hamilton hit three 3-pointers on her way to 18 points and Abi Scheid scored 18 on 7-of-14 shooting from the floor.\n\nThe Wildcats (2-0), who outscored Duke in every quarter, grabbed a 3-0 lead 12 seconds into the game on Scheid's 3-pointer and led the rest of the way.

(AP Photo/Mark Zaleski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tom Brady added another big chunk of NFL history to his resume.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans made sure the Patriots quarterback didn't finish his 300th game by hitting him over and over again.\n\nThe Titans sacked Brady three times and hit him six more times as they beat New England 34-10 Sunday, snapping a seven-game skid against the Patriots in Mike Vrabel's first game as head coach against the team he helped win three Super Bowls.\n\nIt was the most sacks allowed in a game this season by the Patriots (7-3), and coach Bill Belichick pulled Brady for Brian Hoyer midway through the fourth quarter.\n\n\"You got to make Tom blink, and if you make him blink and have to go to a second read you got a chance,\" Vrabel said of his former teammate. \"But if you let him rip it to the first guy he looks at, it's going to be a long day.\"\n\nAsked if he thought Brady was effective, Belichick said to ask Brady.\n\n\"It was just a bad day for all of us,\" Brady said.\n\nOnly Brett Favre (326) has played in more games, both regular season and postseason, as a quarterback than Brady. The three-time NFL MVP also needed only three touchdown passes to tie Peyton Manning (579) for the NFL record for most TD passes all time for both the regular season and postseason.\n\nBrady left having thrown for 254 yards and no TD passes. The Titans outgained the Patriots 385-284, holding New England to just 40 yards rushing. Linebacker Wesley Woodyard, who had 1\u00bd sacks, said that allowed them to get after Brady.\n\n\"Coach Vrabel said make them pay for everything,\" Woodyard said. \"Tackle him, hit him and make him feel it.\"\n\nMarcus Mariota capped each of the first two drives with TD passes, and Derrick Henry ran for a pair of TDs. Ryan Succop also added two field goals as the Titans (5-4) scored a season high in points after jumping out to a 17-3 lead in the first quarter. They now have beaten both of last season's Super Bowl teams in Nashville.\n\nThe loss snaps a six-game winning streak going into New England's bye. The Patriots, who routed the Titans 35-14 in January, also lost to Tennessee for the first time since Dec. 16, 2002.\n\nDarius Jennings opened the game with a 58-yard kickoff return, and Mariota capped the drive with a 4-yard TD pass to Jonnu Smith. The Titans never trailed again.\n\nThe Titans came in with the NFL's stingiest scoring defense and also leading the league in fewest touchdowns allowed in the red zone. They held the Patriots to a pair of 52-yard field-goal attempts by Stephen Gostkowski, who missed his second wide left. James Develin scored on a 1-yard TD run early in the second, which pulled New England within 17-10.\n\nBrady looked ready to pull off another amazing comeback, driving the Pats to the Titans 37. The Titans stopped Brady a yard shy of the first down after catching a pass from Julian Edelman. A false start followed, then Logan Ryan, a former New England cornerback, broke up a Brady pass to Edelman to turn the ball over.\n\nOn the very next play, Vrabel called his own trick play with Jennings throwing to a wide-open Mariota for a 21-yard gain.\n\nHoyer replaced Brady on the next drive.\n\nEX-PATS CONNECTIONS\n\nTennessee fired coach Mike Mularkey after the January playoff loss and hired Vrabel to try to recreate the Patriots' winning ways with the Titans. Vrabel hired Dean Pees, a former Patriots linebackers coach and defensive coordinator, as his defensive coordinator. General manager Jon Robinson, who started in New England, signed cornerback Malcolm Butler and running back Dion Lewis in free agency.\n\n\"That's what happens when you go cheap,\" Lewis said. \"You get your (expletive) kicked.\"\n\nRARE BRADY CATCH\n\nBrady's catch was just the third of his career and first since Dec. 6, 2015, when he caught a 36-yarder from Danny Amendola against Philadelphia. At 41, Brady became the oldest player with a catch since Jerry Rice had 30 at the age of 42. Brady slipped at the end and said he didn't know what happened.\n\n\"It was 'fish out of water,'\" Brady said.\n\nMariota also has three receptions, including catching his own pass in the playoffs last January. Vrabel said Mariota got up faster than Brady did. Mariota said he had one thought on his reception: \"Just catch it.\"\n\nINJURIES\n\nPatriots left tackle Trent Brown missed the final drive of the first half and was announced as questionable to return because of illness. LaAdrian Waddle replaced him for that series, but Brown returned for the first start of the third quarter. Brown left later in the third quarter with an injured back. Edelman hurt an ankle and didn't return. Tight end Dwayne Allen also hurt a knee in the third quarter.\n\nTitans running back David Fluellen picked up 16 yards on back-to-back runs, then went down untouched on the next play with a knee injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPatriots: Bye, then visit Jets on Nov. 25.\n\nTitans: Visit Indianapolis.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Matt Barkley had just put the finishing touches on a stunning victory when he jogged over to the sideline, found his mother in the stands and handed her his well-deserved game ball.\n\nIt was quite a moment for the Buffalo Bills quarterback, who looked nothing like a guy who had no job and an uncertain future just a few weeks ago.\n\nBarkley sparked Buffalo's bumbling offense with two touchdown passes, including one to offensive tackle Dion Dawkins , LeSean McCoy broke out of a season-long slump with 113 yards rushing and a pair of TD runs, and the Bills embarrassed the New York Jets 41-10 on Sunday.\n\n\"For me, I knew I could play in this league,\" Barkley said. \"To get back out there after two years, it was, and I don't want to be clich\u00e9 by saying it was like riding a bike, but I've done this for years. I feel like I was made to play football and (today) was an example of going out there and doing what I was made to do.\"\n\nBarkley made his first start in nearly two years, and looked the best of any of the four quarterbacks the Bills (3-7) have trotted out this season. The 28-year-old journeyman was 15 of 25 for 232 yards while helping Buffalo snap a four-game losing streak as the Bills put up 451 yards of total offense.\n\nBarkley got the nod from coach Sean McDermott ahead of the ineffective Nathan Peterman despite having just two weeks of practice with the Bills since signing on Oct. 30. Rookie Josh Allen has missed four straight games with a sprained right elbow, and Derek Anderson is sidelined with a concussion. Barkley's last start came in the 2016 season finale for Chicago.\n\nNow the question is: Should Barkley be the Bills' starter moving forward?\n\n\"I don't know,\" Barkley said. \"That's a question I don't have the answer to, nor the authority to answer. I'll be ready to play. This QB situation seems to be fluctuating. In whatever way I can help this team, that's my goal.\"\n\nAdded McDermott: \"Give me some time on that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the hot seat under coach Todd Bowles reached a boiling point as the Jets (3-7) got completely manhandled by a team that entered with a league-low 96 points and had two touchdowns in its previous four games.\n\n\"Everything that could've gone wrong went wrong,\" Bowles said. \"We stunk it up as coaches, we stunk it up as players.\"\n\nThe Jets have a bye-week break and the future of Bowles, in his fourth season, is in serious doubt. Owner Christopher Johnson declined comment to reporters after the game.\n\n\"We're going to try like hell to win our last six games,\" Bowles said.\n\nNew York started 39-year-old Josh McCown in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold, but he couldn't prevent the Jets from their fourth straight loss in front of a frustrated fan base that booed lustily throughout.\n\nMcCown was 17 of 34 for 135 yards with two interceptions, and the Jets finished with just 199 total yards.\n\n\"That's the first time I felt like somebody really smacked us,\" cornerback Morris Claiborne said, \"and we didn't do nothing about it.\"\n\nBarkley certainly didn't look rusty, launching a 47-yard pass to Robert Foster on the Bills' first offensive play. Foster, just promoted from the practice squad, beat top Jets cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who had missed the previous five games with an injured quadriceps.\n\nOn the next play, Barkley handed off to McCoy, who scored his first touchdown of the season with a 28-yard run that gave Buffalo a 7-0 lead 49 seconds in.\n\nBarkley and the Bills took a 14-0 lead midway through the opening quarter on a fluky play. On third-and-7 from the 11, Zay Jones caught a pass and took it 10 yards before fumbling as he reached the goal line. Tight end Jason Croom recovered in the end zone for a touchdown that was upheld by video review.\n\nThe 14-play, 73-play drive was prolonged by a fake punt on fourth-and-6 from the Bills 47 when the ball was snapped directly to tight end Logan Thomas, a quarterback at Virginia Tech. Thomas then completed a 19-yard pass to Foster for the first down.\n\nThe Bills outgained the Jets 186-1 after one quarter, and added to their lead less than two minutes into the second quarter on Stephen Hauschka's 54-yard field goal that made it 17-0.\n\nIf there was any doubt as to where this game was headed, the Bills added in some trickery \u2014 and embarrassment for the Jets \u2014 on their next drive.\n\nDawkins lined up as an eligible receiver on first-and-goal from the 7. Barkley, of course, found the 6-foot-5, 320-pound lineman wide open for a touchdown.\n\nThe Jets had another brutal sequence on their next possession, when they had three \u2014 yes, three \u2014 holding penalties called on one play. Then McCown, facing a blitz, threw the ball up down the left sideline and Matt Milano picked it off.\n\nSeven plays later, McCoy ran it in from the 1 \u2014 moments after it was ruled he was down there and had a TD reversed \u2014 to put Buffalo up 31-0.\n\nTHE REAL McCOY\n\nMcCoy surpassed 500 career points, and vaulted into 26th place on the career yards rushing list. He also topped 100 yards rushing for the first time since gaining 156 in a 13-7 overtime win over Indianapolis on Dec. 10.\n\n\"It's like that big monkey's off my back a little bit,\" McCoy said.\n\nMcCoy has 10 career games with at least 100 yards on the ground and two rushing TDs, joining Adrian Peterson as the only active players to do so.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBills CB Taron Johnson left in the third quarter with a shoulder injury and didn't return. ...

(AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes will always have some special TV footage of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrating his record-setting touchdown pass in a win over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.\n\nThat's because Tyreek Hill was the one recording it.\n\nMahomes threw for 249 yards with two TD strikes to Hill, but it was the second one that sent the Chiefs' first-year starter past Hall of Famer Len Dawson for the single-season TD record. It was the 31st for Mahomes \u2014 with six games yet to play \u2014 and it helped lift Kansas City to a 26-14 victory over the Cardinals and another game closer to the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.\n\nHill celebrated the score by leaping into the stands, then commandeering the CBS camera \u2014 earning him an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty from the officials and a sharp rebuke from coach Andy Reid.\n\n\"The celebration just came into my head,\" Hill said. \"For him to come in and do that, that's amazing, man. People doubted him \u2014 'He wasn't going to do this, he wasn't going to do that.' I'm proud of him.\"\n\nHill had seven catches for 117 yards. Kareem Hunt pounded his way for 71 yards rushing. The defense came up with five sacks and two picks. And the Chiefs' special teams were nearly perfect, helping to keep the Cardinals (2-7) winless in six meetings at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n\"It was definitely a grind out there,\" Hunt said, \"and definitely a team that was trying to come up big in a big-time win to get their program back on track, but most importantly we got the win.\"\n\nJosh Rosen had 195 yards passing with a touchdown, but two interceptions and several brutal hits in the fourth quarter no doubt left a lasting impression. David Johnson ran for 98 yards with TDs on the ground and through the air, while Larry Fitzgerald had six catches for 50 yards and passed Terrell Owens for No. 2 on the NFL's career receiving yardage list in the closing minutes.\n\nFitzgerald has 15,952 yards in 15-year career, trailing only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice.\n\n\"I'm pretty close to T.O. His friendship and my relationship with him is valuable to me. He means a great deal to me,\" Fitzgerald said. \"It's frustrating that it comes in another loss.\"\n\nThe Chiefs' weekly air show got started on the game's first play, when Hill ran right past Patrick Peterson to haul in a 38-yard reception. Two plays later, Hill ran past the rest of the Arizona defense and Mahomes found him streaking into the end zone for a 37-yard scoring catch.\n\nArizona answered with a time-consuming 75-yard touchdown drive of its own.\n\nBoth defenses fared better the rest of the half, with the Cardinals sacking Mahomes four times and the Chiefs' rejuvenated defense getting enough pressure to keep Rosen uncomfortable.\n\nThe Chiefs finally reached the end zone again when Mahomes zipped a third-and-goal pass into double coverage to Hill, who cradled it for his quarterback's record-setting score.\n\n\"Listen, he's had a heck of a year,\" Reid said of Mahomes, who was not available after the game because of a family emergency. \"He's played his heart out and I love the backside of that, how he goes about his business. He has a lot on his plate as far as responsibility goes to run the offense.\"\n\nAs for Hill's touchdown celebration?\n\n\"That was too much,\" Reid said, hiding a smile. \"I was not happy.\"\n\nThe Cardinals stuck with Johnson in the second half, and they slowly grinded their way to another touchdown. He carried it six times and finished a 12-play, 61-yard drive with a TD plunge to get Arizona within 20-14 midway through the third quarter.\n\nBut after the Cardinals got the ball back early in the fourth, Rosen had a screen pass picked by Justin Houston at the line of scrimmage. And instead of marching for a go-ahead TD, the Cardinals watched Spencer Ware dive in for a touchdown to extend a lead the Chiefs would never relinquish.\n\n\"Thought the guys fought to the end,\" Cardinals coach Steve Wilks said. \"There are no moral victories in this game. All credit goes to Kansas City. Well-prepared, good football team.\"\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\"I think we did a couple things really well. We've just got to duplicate it.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Before he rolled out of bed, Baker Mayfield had a premonition of near perfection.\n\nMore than a hunch.\n\n\"When I woke up this morning, I was feeling pretty dangerous,\" the Browns rookie quarterback said with a smile and a hint of arrogance. \"I just woke up feeling really dangerous.\"\n\nSomeone should have warned the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nMayfield threw a season-high three touchdown passes and rookie Nick Chubb streaked 92 yards for a TD as the Cleveland Browns ended a four-game losing streak with their best all-around performance in years, a stunning 28-16 win over the Falcons on Sunday.\n\nThe Browns (3-6-1) played their most complete game this season under interim coach Gregg Williams, their defensive coordinator who improved to 1-1 since replacing the fired Hue Jackson.\n\nMayfield outplayed Falcons star quarterback Matt Ryan with an excellent outing that further justifies Cleveland's decision to take the former Oklahoma QB with the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft.\n\nEarlier this week, Williams and offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens urged Mayfield to play loose and not worry about any mistakes.\n\nHe took the message to heart.\n\n\"If you take a step back and watch how he managed the game in the huddle, how he managed the clock, how he managed the check systems and how he managed the overall communication on the offensive side of the ball,\" Williams said. \"A good next step for him.\"\n\nMayfield completed his first 13 passes and finished 17 of 20 for 216 yards. He threw a 28-yard scoring pass to Rashard Higgins, a 13-yarder to Chubb and 11-yarder to Duke Johnson. He went 12 of 12 for 165 yards and two TD passes in the first half, and didn't throw his first incompletion until 11:14 remained in the third quarter.\n\nTwo plays later, he connected with Johnson to put the Browns ahead 21-10\n\n\"It comes down to just doing my job,\" said Mayfield, who appreciated his coaches' trust. \"Them saying they trust me enough to let the ball go, I was brought here for a reason so just go do my thing.\n\n\"That obviously makes me feel comfortable when they say that. It comes down to me doing my job, getting the ball out of my hands. We did a good job of having guys open, finding the holes in their defense and getting completions.\"\n\nRyan threw two touchdown passes but the Falcons (4-5) had their three-game winning streak \u2014 and any playoff momentum \u2014 stopped cold.\n\n\"It is disappointing because we had been playing better than this the last couple of weeks. We're better than what we put out there today, but you're only as good as your last performance. Today was not good enough.\"\n\nAnd while Mayfield did damage, Chubb's record run was the backbreaker.\n\nWith the Browns backed up at their 8, Chubb, who had 176 yards on 20 carries, took a handoff and headed right. He cut toward Atlanta's sideline, picked up a block and then showed his surprising breakaway speed while finishing the longest run in team history.\n\nChubb's run broke the previous team mark held by Bobby Mitchell, who had a 90-yard TD run against Washington on Nov. 15, 1959. It was also the second-longest run by a rookie in league history, behind only Bobby Gage's 97-yard run for Pittsburgh in 1949.\n\n\"A great handoff,\" Mayfield joked. \"When I handed it off, it parted like the Red Sea.\"\n\nThe score put the Browns ahead 28-10, an unexpected and unescapable hole for the Falcons, who blew a chance to get closer in the fourth when they were stopped inches short of the goal line.\n\n\"I told the team I thought we took a step back,\" said Falcons coach Dan Quinn. \"That's tough to see and tough to say. I also told them we must regroup. We're trying to fight for consistency, and we certainly made improvement over the last three weeks, and we didn't get the job done.\"\n\nJULIO MILESTONE\n\nOne of the few positives for the Falcons was receiver Julio Jones, who had 107 yards and became the fastest player to reach 10,000 with a 30-yard catch in the second quarter. Jones reached the 10,000-yard plateau in his 104th game, 11 quicker than Calvin Johnson.\n\n\"He's amazing,\" Ryan said of Jones, who is tied with Hall of Famer Randy Moss with 45 career games with 100 yards or more receiving, the most for a player in his first eight seasons. \"He's a unique and special player. He's as talented as any player probably that has ever played. His skillset is phenomenal. He works extremely hard. He's been awesome to be around for his entire career. It's fun to be a small part of what he's done so far.\"\n\nWISHBONE WISH\n\nKitchens joked earlier in the week he might bring back the \"wishbone\" \u2014 a three-back formation popular with college teams in the 1970s.

(AP Photo/Gustavo Garello) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 After the rain, the fire. Boca Juniors and River Plate drew 2-2 Sunday in a passionately contested first leg of the Copa Libertadores final that was delayed by a day because of thunder, lightning and a torrential downpour.\n\nThe two Argentine clubs hold one of the fiercest rivalries in soccer and it had been called \"The Game of the Century\" because it's the first time they've met in the final of South America's equivalent of the Champions League. It did not disappoint.\n\nVisiting supporters were not allowed because of concerns for potential violence. But home fans at a sold-out La Bombonera Stadium roared when Boca forward Ramon Abila opened the scoring in the 34th minute with a powerful left-foot shot that went through the hands of goalkeeper Franco Armani into the top left corner. Two minutes later, the raucous noise turned to near silence as River striker Lucas Pratto equalized, sending the ball into the bottom left corner.\n\nThe end-to-end game intensified with further goals.\n\nForward Dario Benedetto made it 2-1 to Boca with a header in first-half stoppage time before Boca defender Carlos Izquierdoz scored an own-goal in the 61st as he tried to deflect a free kick with his head.\n\nBenedetto's goals had helped Boca reach the final. He proved himself again when he came into the game in the 26th after Cristian Pavon left the field in tears with a muscle injury.\n\n\"Both teams had a good game and the result was fair for both,\" Benedetto said. \"I think Boca's soccer was better, but River also had its merits.\"\n\nThe match was postponed Saturday because heavy rain flooded the field. The second leg will be played at River's Monumental de Nunez stadium on Nov. 24.\n\nRiver dominated the start and had the clearest chances but Boca goalkeeper Agustin Rossi made a series of superb saves.\n\n\"The Boca goalkeeper had two or three spectacular saves ... We were shooting to goal well but he was saving some very good shots,\" said Pratto, who was voted player of the match. \"It was very good to draw the game and we hope that in the next one we can be champions. It will be 'Kill or be killed.'\"\n\nBoca could have won in the last minute when veteran striker Carlos Tevez broke through into the box and passed the ball to Benedetto, but his point-blank shot was blocked by River's Armani, who is considered one of the best goalkeepers on the continent.\n\n\"We were ahead twice and we couldn't hold the result,\" Boca coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto said. \"We had the game in our hands, but we let it escape from us.\"\n\nComing back twice felt like a triumph for River especially since coach Marcelo Gallardo missed the game. He had been sanctioned for failing to follow a previous suspension that banned him from contacting his players during the tournament's semifinals.\n\nBoca has won the title six times, one behind Argentine club Independiente's South American record of seven. River has won it three times.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Debora Rey contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He touted Whitaker's reputation but repeated his claim that he did not know him, explaining to reporters that Whitaker worked for Sessions.\n\nCritics quickly accused Trump of being dishonest about his relationship with Whitaker, who has visited the White House several times. He acted as an intermediary between Trump and Sessions \u2013 for whom he was chief of staff \u2013 and the president viewed him as \"his eyes and ears at the Justice Department,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump himself said in an interview with Fox News last month, \"Matt Whitaker\u2019s a great guy. I know Matt Whitaker.\"\n\n\"The president does know Matt Whitaker, has gotten to know him over the course of the last year since he has been the chief of staff to the attorney general,\" Conway said in an interview with Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\"The president's point is, it's not like he's putting a friend in there who he's known for his entire life,\" she explained.\n\n\"The president has dealt with Matt Whitaker in many different situations in the White House.

Because he worked for Sessions, who recused himself for the Russia investigation, Whitaker was not up to speed on Mueller's work, she said.\n\nConway dismissed comments Whitaker made casting doubt on Russian election meddling and suggesting Mueller's funding be cut off as statements he made \"as a private citizen a year and a half ago, when the Mueller investigation first started.\"\n\nDemocrats have protested Whitaker's appointment and demanded he recuse himself from matters related to Mueller's investigation because of his expressed opposition to the probe. They fear he will interfere with Mueller's work, or follow through on his idea of killing the investigation by cutting off the money.\n\n\"He should recuse himself because he has expressed total hostility to the investigation. He has said the investigation shouldn't go forward and someone who's said that should not be in charge of deciding on the investigation,\" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos.\" Nadler is expected to be the next chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nConway said Trump has not talked about the Mueller investigation with Mueller and that \"it would be a mistake to try and shut down the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nWallace asked Conway about an op-ed in The Washington Post that was co-authored by her husband, George Conway, calling Whitaker's appointment \"unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"Well, it doesn't affect me or my job at all.

(AP Photo/Frank Victores) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Drew Brees and the Saints rocked Paul Brown Stadium from the opening drive, scoring every time they got the ball except for the last one.\n\nThen they cranked up the music in the locker room until the cinderblock walls were vibrating, too.\n\nFor New Orleans, it was as much fun as it gets in the NFL.\n\nBrees threw three touchdown passes in a blistering first half, moving ahead of Brett Favre for second place on the career list, and New Orleans rolled to its eighth straight victory Sunday, 51-14 over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThen they blasted the music.\n\n\"It's a good time,\" said Brees, who was 22 of 25 for 265 yards and a near-perfect passer rating of 150.4. \"We know how to have fun when it's time to have fun.\"\n\nBrees led the Saints to touchdowns on all five first-half possessions with a nearly perfect performance \u2014 only two incompletions. His 17-yard TD to Michael Thomas with 2 seconds left in the half gave him 509 career touchdown passes, one more than Favre.\n\nUp next: Peyton Manning's record 539.\n\n\"If you play long enough, I guess those things happen,\" Brees said. \"I consider myself very grateful, very blessed.\n\n\"Just take 'em one at a time, keep plugging along, and hopefully there's more to go\"\n\nBrees had his way with the Bengals' historically bad defense , even diving over the pile to score a 1-yard touchdown. Cincinnati (5-4) became the first team in the Super Bowl era to give up 500 yards in three consecutive games; New Orleans finished with 509.\n\nThe Bengals matched the most lopsided defeat in franchise history and gave up the second-most points in club history. In the first half alone, the Saints piled up 311 yards and had 21 first downs on 40 plays. Brees was 18 of 20 for 214 yards with three touchdowns in the opening half.\n\n\"I'm kind of in shock after a loss like that,\" linebacker Jordan Evans said.\n\nIn the last four games, the Bengals have given up 481, 551, 576 and 509 yards. They're on pace to give up the most yards in NFL history.\n\n\"Obviously, your confidence gets shaken,\" coach Marvin Lewis said. \"I just addressed that with them. They have to focus and get determined. It's their job to do it right.\"\n\nMark Ingram and Alvin Kamara recognized Dez Bryant by crossing their arms after scoring touchdowns. The former Cowboys receiver signed with the Saints on Wednesday but tore an Achilles tendon in his second practice.\n\n\"Two days is not a lot of time, and yet there's a lot of respect,\" coach Sean Payton said.\n\nThe Saints sent the Rams to their first loss last week, 45-35, and kept the momentum with their highest-scoring game of the season. Ingram had 13 rushes for 104 yards, and Kamara scored twice as New Orleans picked up 244 yards on the ground.\n\n\"Look, this was a good game, but it wasn't a perfect game,\" Payton said.\n\nPretty close. The only time New Orleans failed to score was when it took a knee at the Bengals 31-yard line to end matters.\n\nWhat's it like playing in an offense like that?\n\n\"It's heaven,\" Kamara said.\n\nAnother encouraging sign for the Saints: Their struggling defense held in check a Bengals offense missing A.J. Green, out indefinitely with an injured toe on his right foot. Andy Dalton went 12 of 20 for 153 yards with two interceptions, including one that Marcus Williams returned 78 yards to set up Brees' third touchdown throw.\n\n\"We all had a hand in it,\" Dalton said.\n\nBAD HISTORY\n\nIt's the fourth time the Bengals have lost a game by 37 points in their history. The club record for points allowed was 52 against Carolina in 2002. The 28 points allowed in the second quarter matched the club record.\n\nRED-ZONED\n\nNew Orleans had allowed touchdowns on 20 of opponents' 28 drives inside the 20-yard line, which ranked 28th out of 32 teams in red zone efficiency. The Bengals managed to get inside the 20-yard line only once, on their opening touchdown drive.\n\nLOCKED IN\n\nBrees has an 89 percent completion percentage when targeting Michael Thomas this season. Thomas finished with eight catches for 70 yards and two touchdowns, including a diving 7-yard catch in the end zone.\n\nPRODUCTIVE THOMAS\n\nThomas has 274 catches in 40 career games, surpassing Odell Beckham Jr., who held the mark for most receptions in NFL history through 40 outings.\n\nINJURIES\n\nSaints: LT Terron Armstead suffered a shoulder injury in the second quarter.\n\nBengals: CB Dre Kirkpatrick suffered a concussion in the second quarter and didn't return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSaints: host the Eagles next Sunday.\n\nBengals: play at Baltimore next Sunday.

And then he made back-to-back bogeys, Danny Lee holed a birdie putt from off the 16th green, and Kuchar had no margin for error.\n\nHe finished with three pars, making nervy 3-footers on the last two holes, to close with a 2-under 69 for a one-shot victory and a big sigh of relief.\n\n\"I didn't want a 3-footer on the last hole,\" Kuchar said. \"I was hoping to have a three or four-shot lead for some wiggle room. But man, that felt awfully good.\"\n\nLee, the only player to sustain a serious threat against Kuchar, finished with two pars for a 65.\n\nKuchar still wasn't entirely in the clear. His 15-foot birdie attempt on the 17th rolled about 3 1/2 feet by the hole, and he had to make that for par to stay in the lead. And on the final hole, he left his 30-foot birdie putt about 3 feet short and had to roll that in for the victory.\n\n\"That was some of the best ball-striking I've had, and through 60 some holes, awfully good putting,\" Kuchar said. \"And then the putter kind of went a little bit on the fritz there coming in. Thrilled to be the champion here. It's been a long time for me. It feels extra sweet right now.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old Kuchar had gone 115 starts on the PGA Tour since his last victory in the RBC Heritage at Hilton Head in April 2014. It comes at the end of what had been a disappointing year in which Kuchar finished out of the top 70 on the PGA Tour money list for the first time since 2007, and he failed to make the Ryder Cup team for the first time in 10 years.\n\n\"My 2018 wasn't what I wanted,\" Kuchar said. \"This is a high note. It's amazing thing to get a win. I go from 'Hola' to 'Aloha.' I'm pretty excited about that.\"\n\nKuchar qualifies for the Sentry Tournament of Champions to start next year at Kapalua.\n\nHe finished at 22-under 262, breaking by one the 72-hole record at Mayakoba previously held by Harris English.\n\nPGA Tour rookie Cameron Champ had a 12-foot eagle attempt on the 13th hole that would have brought him within two shots, but he missed the putt and sent his next tee shot into the mangroves, making double bogey. He had another double bogey on the 17th hole and had to settle for a 69 to tie for 10th.\n\nJ.J. Spaun (66) and Richy Werenski (67) tied for third.\n\nRyder Cup captain Jim Furyk closed with a 67 and was among those who tied for sixth.\n\nKuchar won for the eighth time on the PGA Tour in a career marked more by consistency than trophies. This year, he had neither. He had only four top 10s \u2014 his best finish was a tie for fifth in Phoenix \u2014 and was coming off a tie for 57th in Las Vegas.\n\nHe added Mayakoba at the last minute, and with his regular caddie having previous plans, Kuchar hired a local caddie from El Camaleon.

Week 11 in college football answers these questions and much more. USA TODAY\n\nPurdue Boilermakers head coach Jeff Brohm. (Photo: Mike Carter, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe only redeeming part of rooting for a perennial loser is that you can always retain the belief that the next coach will be the one who finally turns it around. No matter how bad things have gotten, no matter how many losing seasons in a row have been strung together, there\u2019s always hope for the hapless in college football because history shows us that no program is beyond saving.\n\nBut just as Vanderbilt had its James Franklin or Rutgers once upon a time had its Greg Schiano, the turnaround story will end sooner or later. Wins in college football, and particularly unexpected wins, lead to opportunities that cannot be turned down. The only question is how long a program can ride the wave of hope before the tide of reality washes over the shore.\n\nThat\u2019s why the next few weeks won\u2019t be particularly fun for fans of Purdue. Before Sunday, they reasonably could have hoped that the hardest part \u2014 actually finding the miracle worker who could reverse a decade of losing \u2014 was behind them when they hired Jeff Brohm.\n\nInstead, just two years later, they\u2019re going to have to confront the very realistic possibility of finding another one.\n\nFor Purdue, an inexplicable 41-10 loss to Minnesota on Saturday wasn\u2019t the worst news of the weekend. Instead, it came Sunday when Louisville fired Bobby Petrino, signaling an intent to throw everything it has at bringing Brohm back to his hometown, back to the program where he both played and coached as an assistant.\n\nBrohm is only in his second year at Purdue, but it\u2019s easy to see why he\u2019s so highly sought-after. Purdue had been 3-30 in the Big Ten during the previous regime of Darrell Hazell, and Brohm came in right off the bat with a competitive product, reaching a bowl game last season for the first time since 2012. This year Purdue is 5-5 but has beaten three ranked teams including a 49-20 destruction of Ohio State, making Saturday\u2019s confounding loss fairly excusable.\n\nBut make no mistake: This season will not be fondly remembered by Purdue fans if Brohm up and leaves for Louisville, even if they can\u2019t completely blame him for going home. It won\u2019t necessarily doom the Boilermakers to the Big Ten basement again, but it sure raises the anxiety level and puts Purdue at No. 1 in the Misery Index, a weekly measurement of knee-jerk reactions based on what each fan base just watched.\n\nFOUR MORE IN MISERY\n\nVirginia Tech: When we get to opening weekend of the 2019 season, let\u2019s all pledge to keep our overreactions (good or bad) in check and remember how the 2018 Hokies turned out. After a complete domination of Florida State in Week 1, fans were throwing hosannahs at the feet of defensive coordinator Bud Foster, ready to sign head coach Justin Fuente to a lifetime extension and thinking about what it might take to challenge Clemson in the ACC.\n\nNow we know how ridiculous all that was, as 4-5 Virginia Tech is in grave danger of seeing its 25-year bowl streak come to an end. Foster hasn't forgotten how to coach, but his young defense has given up 45 points four times this season and yielded an astounding 14 yards per play in a 52-22 loss to Pitt. We\u2019ll see soon if Fuente, whose stoic sideline demeanor is now grating on fans, has recruited well enough to keep him off the hot seat next season.\n\nUSC head coach Clay Helton. (Photo: Rick Bowmer, AP)\n\nSouthern California: After everything Pat Haden accomplished in his life as a football player, an attorney, a successful businessman and a broadcaster, it is ironic and sad that the word USC fans will most associate with him is incompetence. And yet, that is his irrefutable legacy as athletics director now that the Clay Helton era is totally off the rails following a 15-14 loss to Cal that dropped the Trojans to 5-5.\n\nThough it was Mike Garrett and not Haden who started this fall from grace by hiring Lane Kiffin in 2009, the mistakes were compounded as Haden reached for Steve Sarkisian and then elevated Helton from interim to full-time head coach in what can only be described as a panic move at the end of 2015. At every turn, Haden\u2019s naivet\u00e9 as an athletics administrator was exposed. And though USC has been planning to bring Helton back in 2019, the indignity of this season and the furor it has created in the fan base may force some tough \u2014 and very expensive \u2014 decisions.\n\nMiami: In eight trips to Georgia Tech\u2019s Bobby Dodd Stadium as the head coach at Georgia, Mark Richt never lost. Not even once. But for Richt, who is now at Miami, Saturday was a poorly timed end to that streak in a 27-21 loss to the Yellow Jackets. After starting the season in the top 10, Miami has lost four in a row and is averaging 15 points per game over that span. Moreover, the Hurricanes are just 4-8 against FBS teams going back to the end of last season.\n\nThat\u2019s not what this fan base envisioned after reaching No. 2 in the country late last season when it looked for all the world like Miami was \u201cback.\u201d Though things were never as good as they looked in 2017 and may not be as bad as they seem now, there\u2019s little question Richt is going to have to overhaul what he\u2019s doing offensively, bring in some new staff and perhaps give up playcalling duties. His plan at the moment just isn\u2019t working.\n\nSouth Carolina: Any list of most disappointing teams in college football has to include the Gamecocks, who were the preseason darlings of the SEC cognoscenti but look just as average as every other South Carolina team you remember aside from those handful of years when Steve Spurrier had it rolling.\n\nThe Gamecocks blew a 31-14 lead late in the third quarter at Florida, losing 35-31 before having to watch their hated rivals at Clemson roll another ranked team in prime time. Will Muschamp is 12-12 in the SEC after three years at South Carolina, which somehow seems just about right. His career SEC record is 29-27. At least you know what you\u2019re going to get.\n\nTRENDING TOWARD MISERY\n\nWisconsin: We know this is an upside-down world when Wisconsin gets eliminated from the Big Ten West with two weeks to go and Northwestern, which went 0-3 in non-conference games, clinches its trip to Indianapolis in the span of a couple of hours. At some point, we have to admit that the Badgers haven\u2019t just been bitten by bad luck but that they\u2019ve massively underachieved to be 6-4. Maybe a playoff bid wasn\u2019t in the cards, but the combined record of the teams they\u2019ve beaten is 18-42.\n\nMark Stoops's Kentucky Wildcats missed their chance for a 10th win on the season when they lost for the 17th consecutive time in Tennessee's Neyland Stadium. (Photo: Randy Sartin, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nKentucky: It\u2019s possible nobody is sadder about Kentucky\u2019s 24-7 loss to Tennessee than the College Football Playoff selection committee, whose love affair with the Wildcats (they were ranked No. 11 last week) now must end. But it\u2019s also a brutal loss for Kentucky fans because it both removed any realistic hope of a New Year\u2019s Six Bowl and it came on the heels of a basketball blowout against Duke that will sour the mood around Lexington for quite some time.\n\nN.C. State: In the SEC, people often talk about an \u201cAlabama effect,\u201d where teams are never quite the same after playing the Crimson Tide. Maybe there\u2019s a \u201cClemson effect\" in the ACC. How else do you explain the Wolfpack totally falling apart after suffering its first loss to the Tigers on Oct. 20? Since then, N.C. State has been going in the wrong direction and suffered its worst loss yet on Thursday, 27-23 at home to Wake Forest. Though there\u2019s still a good chance at nine wins because the schedule gets very easy, fans will undoubtedly look back on this season as a missed opportunity to make history.\n\nHouston: The Cougars already should have the West side of the American Athletic Conference locked up. But without stud defensive end Ed Oliver, who has been dealing with a knee injury, the defense has gone from barely acceptable to downright sad. In consecutive losses to SMU and Temple, Houston has given up an astounding 104 points and will need significant help to get to the AAC title game. If the Cougars totally fall apart against Tulane and Memphis in the final two weeks, head coach Major Applewhite could start to feel some serious blowback.\n\nOklahoma State: It would hard for fans of either team to walk away from Saturday\u2019s \u201cBedlam\u201d rivalry feeling very good. Oklahoma fans know they got very lucky in a 48-47 win that required the Sooners to stop a two-point conversion attempt with 1:03 remaining to keep their playoff hopes alive. Oklahoma State fans know it was a missed opportunity to ruin their biggest rival\u2019s season, dropping Mike Gundy to 2-12 against Oklahoma. It\u2019s perhaps the only quibble with his tenure, especially given that four of those losses have been by seven points or fewer.\n\nTOTALLY REAL AND IRRATIONAL MESSAGE BOARD THREADS\n\n\u201cIf Clay isn\u2019t fired, I will file a major lawsuit\u201d \u2014 WeareSC.com\n\n\u201cBring in Petrino as a consultant before Saban and Kirby grab him\u201d \u2014 canesinsight.com (Miami)\n\n\u201cGet outta town Fuente.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Boston College lost its chance to play for an Atlantic Coast Conference championship.\n\nMore important, the Eagles have lost their quarterback and it's not clear when they are getting him back.\n\nFor the second straight year, Anthony Brown was hurt just as BC was lining up for a late-season run, this time sustaining what coach Steve Addazio said were internal injuries on the team's first possession of Saturday night's game against second-ranked Clemson.\n\nThe Tigers won 27-7, clinching their fourth straight Atlantic Division title and remaining on track for a spot in their fourth consecutive College Football Playoff berth. BC, which could have contended for a spot in the conference title game, now looks ahead to games at Florida State and at home against No. 12 Syracuse for a chance at a nine-win season that would be its best in a decade.\n\nThe Eagles (7-3, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) dropped five spots in the AP Top 25 on Sunday to No. 22.\n\n\"On a stage like this, you'd like to feel like you got your full complement, you know? But that didn't happen. And that's life,\" Addazio said after the game. \"So I'm more concerned now about getting ready for Florida State and getting ourselves back in the groove.\"\n\nBrown was brought down by defensive tackle Christian Wilkins on the Eagles' first offensive series, with the 315-pound lineman landing on him with the full force of his body weight. He walked off on his own but went to the locker room soon after and was taken to a hospital during the game.\n\nAddazio said Brown had internal injuries but declined to elaborate. BC spokesman Jason Baum said on Sunday there was no further information on the injury.\n\nWith backup EJ Perry replacing Brown, the BC offense failed to score; the Eagles scored their only points on Michael Walker's 74-yard punt return. A sophomore who had never thrown a pass in college before, Perry went 12 for 21 for 98 yards in the game.\n\nAddazio said he didn't know the extent of Brown's injury. But wasn't ready to write him off like he did last year, when the quarterback blew out his ACL \u2014 also in the 10th game \u2014 after BC had won three straight ACC games in what was seen as a turning point for a program that had gone winless in the league just two years earlier.\n\nBecause Brown needed most of the next 10 months to recuperate, Perry ran the first-team offense for much of the spring and summer.\n\n\"EJ is a stud. We go against him in camp,\" defensive lineman Zach Allen said. \"The stuff he can do with his legs, you aren't going to find a more mobile guy. We have all of the faith in him, and now we have a whole week to help him prepare. ... He's going to step up and I'm excited for EJ, I really am. I'm excited to see how he handles it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Young Kwak) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Fourth-ranked Duke looked shockingly dominant in a practically flawless performance against a top-5 opponent to start the season.\n\nThe Blue Devils sure made a convincing argument to be considered the nation's best team in the season's first week: a 118-84 win against No. 2 Kentucky in Tuesday's Champions Classic in Indianapolis. And that has positioned them to gain ground on top-ranked Kansas when the first AP Top 25 poll of the regular season is released Monday.\n\nThe Blue Devils (2-0) followed the Kentucky romp with Sunday's 94-72 win against Army in its home opener, though they didn't pull away until midway through the second half.\n\n\"We have noticed that we've been getting a lot of attention,\" Duke freshman Zion Williamson said afterward. \"But man, people need to understand that it's one game. There are about 39 or 40 more games left. You just focus on one game in the past, it's not doing nothing for you in the future. Game by game for us.\"\n\nThere were no shortage of highlights in Duke's dominating opener, which marked the most lopsided win against a top-5 opponent in the program's tradition-rich history. Williamson, RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish \u2014 Duke's star freshmen and latest round of potential one-and-done NBA prospects \u2014 combined for 83 points to lead the Blue Devils' free-flowing show of position-less basketball.\n\nPick just about any stat category, and Duke did it well against John Calipari's Wildcats. The Blue Devils shot 54 percent from the field and made 12 of 26 3-pointers, shared the ball (22 assists) and took care of it even at their quick pace (four turnovers).\n\nThe question is whether this was a best-case show of Duke's potential, or a sign of things to come for a team that will \u2014 somehow \u2014 find ways to play better.\n\n\"There were a couple of times throughout the game that I felt like we let off on a lot of things,\" freshman guard Tre Jones said Friday. \"We've watched film on the game already and we have picked out on what we need to improve on from that game in particular. And hopefully we'll do it better next game.\"\n\nSTRONG STARTS\n\nDuke was one of three ranked teams to beat another Top 25 team in the season's first week, joining Kansas and No. 11 Auburn.\n\nThe Jayhawks beat No. 10 Michigan State 92-87 in the Champions Classic's first matchup. They started the year at No. 1 in the AP Top 25 preseason poll for the third time in program history.\n\nAs for the Tigers, they dominated No. 25 Washington in the first half and cruised to an 88-66 home win Friday.\n\nRANKED LOSERS\n\nJoining Kentucky, Michigan State and Washington among the list of AP Top 25 teams to lose in Week 1 was No. 13 West Virginia, though the Mountaineers were the only ones of that group to lose to an unranked opponent.\n\nWest Virginia became the latest upset victim for Buffalo, which beat Arizona and eventual No. 1 overall NBA draft pick Deandre Ayton in the first round of last year's NCAA Tournament. The Bulls got 43 points and 14 rebounds from CJ Massinburg as West Virginia (0-1) lost its home opener for the first time since November 2003.\n\nROAD TESTS\n\nEighth-ranked North Carolina (2-0) won two games against unranked teams, though both came in road games. UNC won at Wofford on Tuesday after an upset home loss to the Terriers last December . Then came Friday's 116-67 win at Elon, the program's best scoring output in any game since November 2008.\n\nIt marked the first time the program opened a season with consecutive road games since the 1986-87 season.\n\nSATURDAY BLOWOUTS\n\nThird-ranked Gonzaga and ninth-ranked Villanova had blowout victories to headline a Saturday schedule that included wins for No. 16 Syracuse, No. 19 Michigan and No. 24 Purdue. For the Wildcats, beating Quinnipiac marked their 13th straight victory dating to last year's run to a second national championship in three seasons.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joedy McCreary contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: http://apnews.com/collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The Latest on NASCAR's elimination race at ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix (all times local):\n\n4:05 p.m.\n\nKyle Busch has won for the eighth time this season and set up a head-to-head showdown with Kevin Harvick for NASCAR's championship.\n\nBusch's win Sunday at ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix tied him with Harvick for most this year in the Cup Series. The two were the most dominant drivers this season and will race next week at Homestead-Miami Speedway for the title against reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Joey Logano.\n\nHarvick finished fifth to close a week in which his team was penalized for cheating. He started from the pole but had a harder day than expected because of a flat tire early in the race.\n\nHarvick was aided when teammate Kurt Busch was wrecked late in the race, taking Kurt Busch out of the running for a championship berth.\n\n___\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nStewart-Haas Racing had a disastrous sequence that cost two of its drivers a shot at the championship.\n\nClint Bowyer wrecked during the second stage of Sunday's race at ISM Raceway. During the caution period for Bowyer's accident, leader Kurt Busch passed the pace car and was penalized for one lap.\n\nBusch was leading the race when he was penalized. He argued that the pace car was driving slower than pit road speed, and that's how he passed the car as he ducked off the track.\n\nThe penalty on Busch gave the lead to Martin Truex Jr.\n\nKevin Harvick restarted third.\n\n____\n\n1:25 p.m.\n\nChampionship contender Joey Logano has crashed out of the final warmup race.\n\nLogano is the only driver already qualified for next week's championship race. He earned his berth by winning at Martinsville three races ago and it allowed him to relax at ISM Raceway. He had nothing on the line and is already looking ahead to the finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nSeven drivers are racing for the final three slots in the championship round.\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin Harvick has driven through a pack of traffic after falling to 30th and down a lap because of a flat tire. By the time Logano crashed, Harvick had already moved to 19th in the field and back to the lead lap.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nA flat tire may have derailed Kevin Harvick's run to another championship.\n\nHarvick was dominating Sunday's race and had led every lap until he ducked onto pit road with a sudden flat tire. Harvick led the first 72 laps but dropped to 30th in the field after the issue. He also went down one lap from the leaders.\n\nChase Elliott won the first stage after inheriting the lead when Harvick had to stop for new tires.\n\nElliott needs to win at ISM Raceway to advance into the championship round next week.\n\n___\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nKevin Harvick led the field to the start of NASCAR's final race to set the championship field. The 2014 champion has dominated all weekend at ISM Raceway and is trying to show his team can overcome a cheating scandal and still win the title.\n\nHarvick is a nine-time winner at the track outside of Phoenix and his No. 4 Ford has been the fastest car here since his Stewart-Haas Racing team unloaded it from the hauler. Harvick was fastest in Saturday's final practices, won the pole, and pulled out to a quick lead when the race began.\n\nHe dominated a week ago at Texas to win and earn an automatic berth into the championship race. But NASCAR ruled that winning car was illegal and stripped Harvick of that slot in the Homestead-Miami Speedway finale. So Harvick has approached Phoenix as if he's got something to prove while chasing the championship.\n\nSeven drivers are vying for three spots in the title race and only Joey Logano is already qualified into the final four.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Ian Book should be back as the No. 1 quarterback for No. 3 Notre Dame this week.\n\nCoach Brian Kelly said Sunday that Book, who missed Notre Dame's victory against Florida State on Saturday night with an upper body injury, is expected to practice Tuesday. If there are no setbacks, Book will reclaim his starting spot over Brandon Wimbush, Kelly said.\n\nBook led the Fighting Irish (10-0, No. 3 CFP) to six straight victories before an upper body injury in Notre Dame's 31-21 victory at Northwestern two weeks ago kept him out of against the Seminoles.\n\nBook was not in uniform Saturday night, but watched Wimbush, the quarterback he replaced four games into the season, throw three first-half touchdown passes in a 42-13 victory.\n\nNotre Dame plays No. 12 Syracuse at Yankee Stadium in New York on Saturday.\n\n\"Ian would be our starting quarterback,\" Kelly said Sunday. Kelly had joked after Saturday's victory about creating a quarterback controversy for the media.\n\nBook led the nation in completion percentage (74.5) and was sixth in passing efficiency (169.96) prior to Saturday's game. For the season, he has thrown for 1,824 yards and 15 touchdowns with four interceptions, and run for 218 yards and four scores.\n\nWimbush ran for 68 yards on 12 carries and was not sacked as the offensive line - center Sam Mustipher, guards Aaron Banks and Tommy Kraemer and tackles Liam Eichenberg and Robert Hainsey - had its way with a Florida State defense that had come into the game allowing just 2.84 yards per rush.\n\n\"We've been waiting for that kind of consistency as a group, and that includes the tight ends (Alize Mack, Cole Kmet and Nic Weishar),\" Kelly said. \"They were much more effective and efficient.\"\n\nNotre Dame did not lose a yard on any of its 50 rushes. Dexter Williams ran for a career-high 202 yards on 20 carries, including TD runs of 58 and 32 yards, and his backups Jafar Armstrong and Tony Jones Jr. combined for 83 yards on 13 runs.\n\nLast season with All-Americans and future first-round NFL draft choices in guard Quenton Nelson and tackle Mike McGlinchey leading the way, the Irish averaged 269.3 yards per game (seventh nationally) during a 10-3 season, going 2-2 in November.\n\nNotre Dame entered Saturday's game against the Seminoles rushing for 181 yards per game (53rd nationally) and were coming off a roller-coaster three games in victories over Pittsburgh (80 rushing yards), Navy (254) and Northwestern (121). Notre Dame's season-high rushing effort was 272 yards against Stanford.\n\nFirst-year line coach Jeff Quinn has worked through the season-ending injury of preseason All-America guard Alex Bars. The 6-5\u00be, 319-pound sophomore Banks has emerged as Bars' replacement.\n\nSenior Trevor Ruhland, who has started games at both guard positions and is Mustipher's backup, did not play Saturday because of elbow strain, allowing the 6-foot-6, 316-pound Kraemer to get all the snaps at right guard.\n\n\"Tommy obviously stepped in there at the guard position (and) played well,\" Kelly said. \"When you don't have one negative play against a very athletic defensive front, it's the entire group playing well together, and that's how we had it graded out.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Duke got something from Army that it didn't against Kentucky: A test.\n\nThe fourth-ranked Blue Devils pulled away to beat the Black Knights 94-72 on Sunday behind 27 points and 16 rebounds from Zion Williamson.\n\nPlaying five days after routing the second-ranked Wildcats in the Champions Classic , they shot 49 percent but couldn't shake the Black Knights until the final 10 minutes, finally pulling away with an 11-0 run keyed by 3-pointers from fellow freshmen RJ Barrett and Cameron Reddish.\n\n\"It's one thing for somebody to tell you that everybody's going to bring their best against you, that all their shots are going to feel like they're going in,\" Williamson said. \"But I think until you truly experience it, I think you just have to go through it to fully understand.\"\n\nReddish finished with 25 points and Barrett had 23 while Williamson added six blocked shots and four assists for the Blue Devils (2-0).\n\nCoach Mike Krzyzewski called it \"a perfect game for us following Kentucky\" and said his team's preparation wasn't as at a high enough level beforehand.\n\n\"That whole thing, the hangover of success and travel and then getting ready\" for a game, Krzyzewski said. \"The only way you do it is to do it. And our guys don't feel good about themselves right now. And that's good. Although they turned it around in the second half, they were in a position to lose the game and they responded, and they responded really well.\"\n\nMatt Wilson scored 15 points and Tommy Funk added 12 for Army (1-1), and Funk hit back-to-back 3s to pull the Black Knights to 67-61 with just over 12 minutes left.\n\nReddish hit a driving layup, and he and Barrett each hit 3s on consecutive possessions to push the lead into double figures for good. Reddish added another 3 to stretch the lead to 78-61 with just over 9 minutes left, and the Blue Devils eventually went up by 20 on Williamson's stickback with less than 4 minutes to play.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nArmy: Plenty to build on for the Black Knights, who proved themselves as much more than just a sentimental Veterans Day choice for Duke and Krzyzewski, a former Black Knight player and coach himself. They didn't back down against a preseason Final Four favorite, and were very much in the game until the final 10 minutes. That will pay off once conference play begins.\n\n\"Our guys stuck to the game plan,\" Army coach Jimmy Allen said. \"Trying to keep them out of the paint, trying to keep them from getting some easy baskets inside and force them to take some shots from the perimeter, and trying to get them to have to make a few passes in a possession.\"\n\nDuke: As dominant as the Blue Devils looked against Kentucky, they looked equally vulnerable during stretches of this one, perhaps proving that college basketball won't be as easy for these freshmen as they made it look in the Champions Classic. It wound up being another blowout, but there were plenty of teachable moments for Krzyzewski: Duke left far too many perimeter shooters open and too often settled for low-percentage shots \u2014 the 36 3-pointers attempted were its most since 2016.\n\n\"Today was a learning experience,\" Reddish said. \"We can't dwell on any win.\"\n\nKEY STATS\n\nDuke also trailed for the first time this season \u2014 for 12 seconds during the opening minute. ...

There have been cases of animals biting passengers, getting loose, urinating and worse. The airlines had to do something due to the number of bad events that continued to rise.\n\nCurrent requirements for certification for the need for the animal by a doctor or physiologist appear to be reasonable.\n\nFlight crews face a very difficult situation when a passenger wants to bring an animal onboard for emotional support. They have the responsibility for the safety of all the passengers to consider.\n\nSome of the animals are wonderfully trained and no problem (e.g. the guide dogs for passengers with vision impairment). However, there have been some serious problems with animals not as well trained.\n\nThe FAA has numerous case reports of these events.\n\nMore: 'I was literally in it': Man sits in feces on Delta flight\n\nQ: Captain Cox, I have a close friend that flies a 747 for Singapore Airlines and is an \"Animal Hauler,\" usually out of Africa to zoos, etc. What are the changes that must be made to the plane?

Consequently, some flights carry animal attendants onboard who have tranquilizers if necessary for the animal(s).\n\nTaking a large airplane into remote places is always a challenge. The infrastructure must be evaluated before the flight arrives to ensure proper ground handling.\n\nThe customer transporting the animals pays for the cleaning one way or another.

(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The three most dominant drivers of this NASCAR season will fittingly race each other for the championship, a chance for Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Martin Truex Jr. to settle which team is truly the best.\n\nIt was Busch who claimed the latest round, winning for the eighth time this year Sunday to tie Harvick for the most Cup victories. His win at ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix was the final qualifying event for next week's finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, where it will be winner-take-all between NASCAR's so-called Big Three and the driver once called \"Sliced Bread.\"\n\nBusch, Harvick and reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr., coined The Big Three because of how they dominated the regular season, advanced into the championship round as expected. Joey Logano, nicknamed \"Sliced Bread\" before his NASCAR debut at age 18 because he was predicted to be \"the best thing since ...,\" has the fourth spot.\n\nThe field is two Ford drivers, two Toyota drivers and represents four organizations. Chevrolet was shut out of the finale.\n\n\"I don't know how you could pick a favorite necessarily,\" Busch said. \"I would predict this is the best four, the closest four that have been in our sport in a long time.\n\nBusch and Harvick have gone win-for-win all year, and Busch could have controlled Harvick's fate late in the race when he was lined up against Harvick teammate Aric Almirola on a restart. An Almirola victory would have eliminated Harvick from the playoffs, which Busch acknowledged considering.\n\n\"I did think about it,\" Busch said. \"But I'm here to win the race. They always want it to play out naturally.\"\n\nNow Busch might just have the momentum to take the title.\n\n\"I'd like to think it gives us a lot (of momentum) but I don't know, talk is cheap,\" Busch said. \"We've got to be able to go out there and perform and just do what we need to do. Being able to do what we did here today was certainly beneficial. I didn't think we were the best car, but we survived and we did what we needed to do. It's just about getting to next week and once we were locked in, it was 'All bets are off and it's time to go.'\"\n\nHarvick was the favorite to win Sunday and started from the pole but an early flat tire made Sunday's race more eventful than Harvick expected.\n\nHe found himself racing late against Stewart-Haas Racing teammates Kurt Busch and Aric Almirola for the fourth transfer spot to Homestead, but Busch was wrecked late and Almirola had to win the race to snatch the berth away from Harvick.\n\n\"We kept ourselves in position all day and there at the end, it was just like everybody wrecking and all over the place,\" Harvick said. \"We just needed to stay out of trouble and try to find a safe spot there.\"\n\nBrad Keselowski and Kyle Larson, both already eliminated from the playoffs, finished second and third. Almirola was fourth and Harvick fifth.\n\nHarvick was stripped of his berth to Homestead that he'd earned by winning a week ago at Texas when NASCAR ruled his car was illegal. The penalty forced him to requalify and he had to do it without his crew chief or car chief. But he's a nine-time winner at this track, was fastest in practice, started on the pole and led the first 72 laps before his tire went flat.\n\nThat put Harvick back in 30th and one lap down, and he had to work his way back to the front the rest of the race. He was aided by a flurry of mistakes by the other championship contenders. Clint Bowyer had a flat tire that caused him to wreck, Kurt Busch was wrecked and that accident collected Chase Elliott, who earlier had been penalized for speeding on pit road. Kurt Busch also had been penalized early in the race for passing the pace car.\n\nThe intensity of the race picked up with a flurry of late cautions that began when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. wrecked with 48 laps remaining. Stewart-Haas Racing used split strategy on the ensuing pit stop as Kurt Busch stayed on the track to move into second and Harvick pitted for new tires to restart sixth. NASCAR then stopped the race for the extensive cleanup needed for Stenhouse's crash and the cars parked on the track for close 11 minutes.\n\nBut Kurt Busch never got to find out if his strategy was the right one as he was promptly wrecked on the restart. Denny Hamlin, trying to keep his streak of winning at least once in every season, aggressively tried to dart to the front and while doing so shoved Busch's car into the wall. As Busch's car ricocheted back into traffic he tagged Chase Elliott to end Elliott's bid to race his way into the finale.\n\n\"Denny came out of nowhere and cleaned us out,\" said Kurt Busch.\n\nAlex Bowman then spun, NASCAR again stopped the race for a cleanup, and Aric Almirola used the sequence to make his play for the victory. He restarted third, behind teammate Harvick, on the restart.\n\nAlmirola dove to the bottom of the track to slip past Harvick and move into second. Another caution with 17 laps remaining put Almirola on the front row alongside Kyle Busch for the restart with 12 to go. But Almirola didn't have much for Kyle Busch, who pulled away. With Almirola out of contention for the victory, Harvick was finally in the clear.\n\nMore from ISM Raceway:\n\nLOGANO CRASHES: Logano had a short day at Phoenix because his left rear tire went flat and caused him to spin. He wound up 37th with an early exit, but didn't think it would hurt his momentum for the championship.\n\n\"These things are out of your control, so it doesn't really knock your confidence down,\" Logano said. \"There's nothing my team could do different, so there's really nothing to get depressed about.\"\n\nLogano believes he's the favorite to win the title because by winning the opening race of this round to qualify for Homestead gave Team Penske two additional weeks to focus on the main event.\n\nUP NEXT: The season finale and championship race Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.

Villar) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Not even two goals by Lionel Messi could save Barcelona from its first Spanish league home defeat in more than two years on Sunday when Real Betis won 4-3 at Camp Nou.\n\nReal Madrid took advantage of Barcelona's unexpected slip by winning 4-2 at Celta Vigo to close the gap on the leaders.\n\nBetis never trailed as it ended Barcelona's run of 42 unbeaten home games in the league that dated back to a 2-1 defeat to Alaves in September 2016.\n\nMessi did all he could to keep Barcelona's streak going in his first game back since breaking a bone in his right forearm three weeks ago.\n\nThe Argentina forward scored a second-half penalty, set up substitute Arturo Vidal to reduce the deficit to 3-2, and added a final goal for the hosts late in stoppage time.\n\nBut Betis led 2-0 at halftime thanks to opening goals by Junior Firpo and Joaquin Sanchez. Giovani Lo Celso and substitute Sergio Canales then responded to Messi's spot kick and Vidal's goal, respectively, to keep Betis comfortably in front.\n\nBarcelona was left with 10 men in the 82nd minute when Ivan Rakitic earned a second booking for a hard tackle on Lo Celso. A minute later Firpo led another attack for Betis from the left flank, passing for substitute Canales to slide and push in what proved to be the winner.\n\n\"They won the match in the first half,\" Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said. \"We played a poor first half, and then each time we got closer they hit us right back.\"\n\nBarcelona hadn't lost at home in any competition since Valverde's debut in the Spanish Super Cup at the start of the 2017-18 season, when it lost 3-1 to Real Madrid.\n\nBarcelona remained one point ahead of Atletico Madrid, which it visits next round after an international break.\n\nSevilla and Alaves also moved level on points with Atletico after fighting back for victories.\n\nMadrid remained in sixth place, but moved to within four points of leader Barcelona.\n\nSOLARI IN CHARGE\n\nSantiago Solari likely improved his chances that Madrid president Florentino Perez will decide to leave him in charge of the team after he coached Madrid to a fourth straight win since replacing Julen Lopetegui two weeks ago.\n\nSolari had been promoted from the reserve team on an interim basis.\n\nWhen asked about Solari's future, Madrid club spokesman Emilio Butragueno limited his comments to \"what I can say is that we are very happy (with Solari).\"\n\nAfter Karin Benzema opened the scoring with a classy goal, Madrid got an own-goal by Gustavo Cabral, a penalty by Sergio Ramos and a late goal by substitute Dani Ceballos. Hugo Mallo and Brais Mendez scored for Celta, which never seriously threatened to equalize.\n\nNEAR THE TOP\n\nSevilla earned a 2-1 win at home over Espanyol after scoring two late goals.\n\nGabriel Mercado canceled out Borja Iglesias' opener by scoring from a corner kick in the 70th. Wissam Ben Yedder then chipped in a pass from Ever Banega to get the winner with one minute remaining.\n\nEspanyol was left in fifth place after its first loss in seven rounds.\n\nAlaves, a small club from the northern Basque region, mounted its third comeback win of the season to beat Huesca 2-1 with goals by Jonathan Rodriguez and Ruben Sobrino.\n\nVillarreal also drew 2-2 at Rayo Vallecano.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ian Maule/Tulsa World via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Oklahoma changed defensive coordinators mid-season, yet the results have been painfully familiar.\n\nThe past two weeks under interim coordinator Ruffin McNeill, the Sooners have been forced to try to win shootouts in the fourth quarter. No. 6 Oklahoma defeated Texas Tech 51-46 two weeks ago, then fought off a late 2-point conversion attempt to defeat Oklahoma State 48-47 on Saturday night . Statistically, those performances haven't been much different than the 48-45 loss to Texas that got defensive coordinator Mike Stoops fired.\n\nThe Sooners' offense has continued to purr, with quarterback Kyler Murray continuing his run at the Heisman Trophy. But they know the defense still isn't where it needs to be for Oklahoma to have a shot at a national title.\n\n\"I'm not satisfied,\" Oklahoma linebacker Curtis Bolton said after the Sooners gave up 640 yards to Oklahoma State. \"I'm not happy with how we played. We've got to play better. We can't give up 50 points and expect to be a playoff defense, a playoff team.\"\n\nThe Sooners have made big plays at times on defense \u2014 Robert Barnes ran back an interception on a 2-point conversion for two critical points against Texas Tech and Tre Brown got a deflection on the 2-point conversion against Oklahoma State.\n\n\"Getting critical stops?\" McNeill said. \"Is that a category? Maybe somebody should look that up. Getting critical stops and stopping the two-point play was pretty big. The two-point play last week for an interception, it helped us win.\"\n\nBut the Sooners are struggling, especially in the first half of games. Oklahoma allowed 24 points in the first half against TCU, though one of those scores was on a kickoff return; 31 in the first half against Texas Tech and 28 in the first half against Oklahoma State.\n\nMcNeill aware that there are critics, but he's focused on his FIDO mantra \u2014 Forget It and Drive On. He likes the challenge of trying to get the defense to a higher level.\n\n\"I don't listen to radio and stuff like that,\" he said. \"I know that's a part of it now, being the complete team and making sure we do our part. It doesn't intimidate me. It even motivates not just me, but our staff and our players.\"\n\nAnd Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley sees progress in the past four games, all wins, under McNeill's watch.\n\n\"Some of our, the way we run to the football, our mentality \u2014 I do think there's absolute growth,\" Riley said. \"And there's going to have to be, no doubt. The challenges that we got coming up are going to be there. But the great thing for us right now is that every goal we want to be in front of us is right there in front of us.\"\n\nOklahoma's next chance to show improvement will be Saturday against Kansas. The Sooners want to get things right before they face West Virginia's powerful offense the following week. But even if the Sooners don't put up the numbers they want, they are most concerned with the number on the scoreboard.\n\n\"What do I think?\" McNeill said. \"Win by one. Win the game. Because when you've been in it as long as I have, you know how hard wins are.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Monaco has won just one game in 18 in all competitions this season and is languishing in 19th place.\n\nOnly goal difference separates Monaco from last-placed Guingamp, a crushing fall from grace for a Monaco side which won the league title in 2017 after winning the last 12 games of the season.\n\nIt could have been even worse for Henry, with two further PSG goals ruled out for offside.\n\nMonaco had the first attack of the game but then let in two goals inside the first 12 minutes, both initially disallowed but then given following a video review.\n\nMonaco botched a routine clearance for the first after five minutes, with Neymar reacting quickly to collect the loose ball and pick out Cavani for a tap in. Cavani then slid in the second goal following a cross from the left.\n\nGoalkeeper Diego Benaglio made three fine saves to keep the score down before VAR was used once more, as this time Julian Draxler's goal was ruled out for offside.\n\nCavani's third came in the 54th when he was well set up by midfielder Moussa Diaby and, after Kylian Mbappe was fouled, Neymar sent Benaglio the wrong way from the penalty spot and then danced in front of the travelling PSG fans.\n\nPlaying against the club which sold him for 180 million euros ($204 million), Mbappe showed remarkably quick feet to control the ball and score past Benaglio in the 78th but the goal was ruled offside.\n\nOTHER MATCHES\n\nMarseille beat Dijon 2-0 at home to finally get back to winning ways after losing the last four games.\n\nMarseille lost twice in the league and twice in the Europa League to Lazio, tumbling out of the European competition at the group stage this week after reaching last year's final.\n\nAfter conceding 10 goals in those four games, Marseille finally kept a clean sheet this time.\n\nCenter half Adil Rami was involved in both goals. In first-half injury time, Dimitri Payet's corner was headed on by Rami and winger Lucas Ocampos sent the ball in at the back post.\n\nPayet's cross led to the second goal in the 85th minute, headed in from close range by Rami following a scramble in the penalty area.\n\nMarseille moved above Nice into sixth place.\n\nAlso Sunday, imposing striker Emiliano Sala moved to the top of the scoring charts with 11 goals as midtable Nantes drew 1-1 at Rennes.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton won the race helping his team to take the constructors' title. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Ten years after securing his first Formula One title at Interlagos, five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton won the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday and helped his Mercedes team take the Formula One constructors' title for the fifth straight year.\n\nIt was Hamilton's 10th victory of the season, finishing 1.4 seconds ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.\n\nBut it could have been a very different outcome for the British driver, who struggled with engine problems and medium tires as he waited for rain that never came.\n\nHamilton's second win in Sao Paulo was only possible after Force India's backmarker Esteban Ocon clashed with race leader Verstappen on lap 44, causing both cars to spin. At the time, the Red Bull driver led Hamilton by five seconds.\n\n\"That (incident) put us back in contention,\" Hamilton said of his rival's setback. \"Max is that go-getter guy and every now and again it bites you. But I am really, really proud here, I don't care about anybody else.\"\n\nOff the track, the 21-year-old Dutchman later confronted \u2014 and pushed \u2014 former Formula 3 rival Ocon, who refused to apologize despite the stop-go punishment he was given during the race. The Force India driver finished 15th.\n\nVerstappen managed to stay in the race after the incident and get closer to Hamilton in the final laps, but it wasn't enough for his second consecutive victory.\n\n\"I hope I can't find him in the paddock now,\" Verstappen said of Ocon before he met the Force India driver after the race.\n\nVerstappen was given an unusual punishment for the pushes and insults he aimed at Ocon \u2014 he will have to perform two days of public service at the direction of motorsport governing body FIA within six months.\n\nFerrari's Kimi Raikkonen joined Hamilton and Verstappen on the podium. His teammate Sebastian Vettel, who is second in the overall standings, placed sixth.\n\nHamilton celebrated his win and his team's fifth title with samba dancers on the podium, as Verstappen left still fuming.\n\n\"This is what everyone works for, we really pulled together as a unit this year,\" Hamilton said. His teammate Valtteri Bottas finished fifth.\n\nMercedes now has an insurmountable 620 points against Ferrari's 553.\n\nIt was Hamilton's 72nd victory in Formula One, a much celebrated one after all the problems he faced during the race.\n\n\"We were managing that in the last part of the race, we were losing some power,\" the British driver said.\n\nIn the first part of the race Hamilton kept the advantage he acquired by taking his 10th pole position of the season. Bottas overtook Vettel for second place, and for a moment it seemed Mercedes had the race in the bag already.\n\nVerstappen, the winner of the Mexican GP two weeks ago, started in fifth and quickly overtook the two Ferraris, conquered Bottas on lap 10 and showed he would challenge Hamilton for the win.\n\nAfter the world champion pitted on lap 19, it appeared Mercedes had made the wrong decision by giving Hamilton fresh tires before his rivals. Verstappen only stopped 16 laps later.\n\nWith 31 laps to go, Verstappen successfully challenged Hamilton and started building a lead before clashing with Ocon.\n\nThe British driver initially opened a lead of five seconds over Verstappen. But the Dutchman started climbing back on every lap, thanks to Hamilton's engine problems and medium tire deterioration.\n\nThe race at Interlagos marked the first time since 1970 there were no Brazilian drivers on the grid. Still, attendance was higher than last year's race when Felipe Massa bid farewell driving a Williams. Race organizers said around 150,000 fans attended over three days, 10,000 more than last year.\n\nMassa, who lost the 2008 title to Hamilton and is now a TV pundit, was sorry for Verstappen, but impressed with Hamilton's luck on Sunday.\n\n\"We are both huge fans of Ayrton Senna, who nailed some lucky wins every now and then. Only true champions like Hamilton nail wins like this, when all seems lost,\" the Brazilian said.\n\nThe final race of the season is at Abu Dhabi on Nov. 25.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Dave Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 The fourth goal in the Manchester derby showed the gulf between the two rivals isn't only widening in their Premier League positions but in technical quality as well.\n\nWith slickness and finesse, Manchester City strung together a 44-pass move before Ilkay Gundogan completed a 3-1 victory for the league leaders over Manchester United on Sunday.\n\nCity's 12-point advantage over United is the largest after 12 games in the post-1992 Premier League era. And Jose Mourinho's eighth-place team is as close to Cardiff in the relegation zone as it is to defending champion City at the top.\n\n\"I think we are not going to be relegated,\" Mourinho said dryly, when United's position was pointed out. \"I think it's not a bad performance at all, it's a performance with mistakes. We paid for the mistakes. All the three goals are our mistakes.\"\n\nCompletely outplayed by English football's dominant force, Mourinho has little prospect of dethroning City as champions. A third attempt at bringing the Premier League trophy back to Old Trafford for the first time since Alex Ferguson retired in a blaze of glory in 2013 already appears over after barely a third of the season.\n\nCity's opener came in the 13th minute when Raheem Sterling crossed to Bernardo Silva, who cut the ball back for David Silva to sweep into the net.\n\nThe only surprise was City's inability to pile on more goals, with David Silva and Sergio Aguero also netting in a match where United was restricted to one shot on target, 36 percent possession and lacked the verve provided by the injured Paul Pogba.\n\n\"The way people who don't understand football analyze it is with stats,\" Mourinho said. \"I don't go for stats.\"\n\nThe manager could look at his players' lack of urgency on the ball.\n\nThree minutes into the second half, Jesse Lingard conceded possession on the halfway line to Fernandinho who set Aguero free on a run to goal. After playing a one-two with Riyad Mahrez, Aguero struck through David De Gea's raised arms at the near post to celebrate his new silver haircut with a goal.\n\nSomething did go right for United after Lingard was replaced by Romelu Lukaku.\n\nThe striker had been on the pitch only a minute when he was brought down by City goalkeeper Ederson and Anthony Martial reduced the deficit from the penalty spot.\n\n\"We were in a fight to try to get the equalizer,\" Mourinho said.\n\nThen the third goal came in the 44-pass move that started with Benjamin Mendy seizing control of the ball and ended with Gundogan left clear by Nemanja Matic to meet Bernardo Silva's cross and put the ball past De Gea in the 86th minute.\n\nThis was how City wants to be viewed on the world stage: A team producing scintillating soccer on the field. Not as the team that appears to use elaborate financial mechanisms to try to avoid failing sporting financial regulations, as the Abu Dhabi ownership has been accused of doing after internal correspondence leaked over the last week.\n\nChampions last season with 100 points, City heads into the international break with a two-point lead over Liverpool.\n\n\"We're scoring a lot of goals, creating a lot of chances, conceding few,\" City manager Pep Guardiola said, \"and that is a rhythm.\"\n\nEven Watford and Bournemouth now sit above United, with Tottenham seven points in front in the fourth and final Champions League spot. Mourinho blamed the European competition for United's collapse in the blue half of Manchester. While United had a tough midweek trip to Juventus \u2014 coming from behind to win 2-1 \u2014 City had the luxury of facing a weak Shakhtar Donetsk and easing to a 6-0 win.\n\n\"I'm not going to give that as an excuse,\" said Mourinho, a three-time Premier League winner with Chelsea. \"That's not me.\"\n\nOnly he did.\n\n\"Everybody has to agree,\" Mourinho said. \"One thing is to go to Juventus and play against one of the best teams in the world and play for 94 minutes in the limits, not just the physical but the mental.\n\n\"It's another thing to beat Shakhtar Donetsk at home and enjoy the game and be relaxed. It's completely different. We arrived in a little bit of different circumstances. I think some of the boys, they felt it a little bit.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Packers capitalized after Dolphins' quarterback Brock Osweiler mishandled a shotgun snap that was recovered by Reggie Gilbert at the Green Bay 30.\n\n___\n\n4:20 p.m.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers had very little to show for gaining 501 yards offense in a 16-3 loss to Washington.\n\nThe Buccaneers became just the second team since 1940 to top 400 yards and score 3 or fewer points, according to Pro Football Reference. They join the then-St. Louis Rams, who had 424 yards offense in a 24-3 loss to Green Bay in 2011.\n\nFour turnovers, including two interceptions thrown by Ryan Fitzpatrick, didn't help.

He also caught a 13-yard pass from Baker Mayfield in the second quarter.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans are following up their big win in Dallas with a strong first half against the Patriots.\n\nTennessee scored a season-high 28 points to beat the Cowboys on Monday night, and they now lead New England 24-10 at halftime.\n\nThe Titans scored a season-high 17 points in the first quarter with touchdown passes by Marcus Mariota on each of their first two possessions. Mariota is 11 of 16 for 152 yards.\n\nThe Titans have been getting plenty of pressure on Tom Brady. Former Patriots cornerback Logan Ryan sacked Brady on the final play of the first half, the Titans' second sack of the first half.\n\nJames Develin has run for a TD, and Stephen Gostkowski connected on one of his two 52-yard field goal attempt for New England.\n\n\u2014 Teresa M.

The fund was set up to help the families of the 12 people killed by a gunman in Thousand Oaks, the home of the Rams' training complex.\n\nWhitworth is in the second season of a three-year, $36 million deal with the Rams. He has played a major role in the Rams' transformation into an elite NFC team under Sean McVay.\n\nWhitworth, Todd Gurley, Jared Goff, Michael Brockers and other players are also auctioning off their game jerseys to benefit the victims' fund and American Red Cross Southern California Wildfire Relief.\n\nTwo wildfires are also burning in the same general area of the western Los Angeles suburbs.\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nNew Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees has moved ahead of Brett Favre for second place on the career regular-season touchdown list with a sensational first half at Cincinnati.\n\nHe's thrown three TD passes as the Saints have raced ahead 35-7, reaching the end zone on all five possessions. Brees has 509 career TD passes, one more than Favre.\n\nPeyton Manning holds the record with 539.\n\nThe Saints have piled up 311 yards, and they have 21 first downs on 40 plays. Brees is 18 of 20 for 214 yards.\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nBaker Mayfield enjoyed a perfect half.\n\nCleveland's rookie quarterback completed 12 of 12 passes for 165 yards and two touchdowns in the first half against Atlanta. Mayfield connected on a 28-yard TD with Rashard Higgins and threw a 13-yard scoring pass to Nick Chubb.\n\nMayfield finished the half with a 158.3 quarterback rating, the highest possible score. The Browns did have one interception in the half, but it was thrown by running back Dontrell Hilliard, who attempted to hit a well-covered Mayfield on a trick play.\n\n___\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mahomes has broken the Kansas City Chiefs record for touchdown passes in a season.\n\nThe first-year starter threw his 31st of the season \u2014 and second of the game to Tyreek Hill \u2014 to pass Len Dawson. The Hall of Famer threw 30 in 1964.\n\nThe record-setter came on third-and-goal from the Arizona 14. Hill celebrated by leaping into the stands, just as he did on his first TD catch, then playing with the TV cameras.\n\nThat last bit earned Hill an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.\n\n\u2014 Dave Skretta reporting from Kansas City\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nAtlanta receiver Julio Jones has reached 10,000 yards receiving faster than any player in NFL history.\n\nJones reached the plateau in his 104th career game, catching a 30-yard pass in the second quarter from Matt Ryan.

And then tight end Jason Croom recovered teammate Zay Jones' fumble in the end zone to put the Bills ahead 14-0.\n\nBuffalo's 14 points are the most they've scored in seven games, since a 27-6 victory at Minnesota on Sept. 23. And the Bills are doing this with Matt Barkley making his debut at quarterback less than two weeks after signing with Buffalo.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nNew Orleans quarterback Drew Brees has thrown two touchdown passes against Cincinnati to up his regular-season total to 508 and match Brett Favre for second on the NFL career list.\n\nBrees first TD was a 7-yarder to Michael Thomas midway through the first quarter.

Three plays were needed, with Patrick Mahomes connecting with Tyreek Hill for 38 yards, then for a 37-yard touchdown.\n\nTennessee's Darius Jennings returned the opening kickoff 58 yards, then the Titans needed seven plays to go 40 yards, capped by Marcus Mariota 4-yard TD pass to Jonnu Smith against New England.\n\nChicago's Tarik Cohen had a 3-yard TD run to cap an eight-play, 75-yard drive vs. Detroit. But Cody Parkey missed the extra point.\n\nIndianapolis covered 75 yards in seven plays and Andrew Luck found Eric Ebron for a 53-yard scoring pass against Jacksonville.\n\nBuffalo used a mere two plays against the Jets, with newcomer Matt Barkley throwing 47 yards to Robert Foster before LeSean McCoy broke from a lengthy slump for his first touchdown this season, on a 28-yard run.\n\nAnd Drew Brees threw his 507th career touchdown pass, leaving him one behind Brett Favre for second place on the career list, capping a 15-play, 75-yard drive that consumed 8 minutes, 30 seconds. It ended with Michael Thomas' diving 7-yard catch.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes needed only 56 seconds to throw his first touchdown pass against Arizona, moving him into a tie with Hall of Famer Len Dawson for the single-season franchise record.\n\nMahomes hit Tyreek Hill down the sideline for 38 yards on the game's first play. Then, after an incompletion, Mahomes found Hill again for a 37-yard touchdown reception.\n\nIt was the 30th thrown by Mahomes this season. Dawson threw 30 during the 1964 season.\n\n\u2014 Dave Skretta reporting from Kansas City.\n\n___\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts honored kicker Adam Vinatieri, the NFL's new career scoring leader, with a brief highlight show during pregame introduction before their game against Jacksonville.\n\nVinatieri received a roaring ovation from the Lucas Oil Stadium crowd when he was announced as the final starter. The 45-year-old waved to the crowd and slapped hands with a group of fans gathered around the American flag on the field.\n\nVinatieri broke Morten Andersen's record two weeks ago at Oakland, but the Colts had a bye last week and Sunday marked the first time Indy could celebrate the record-breaking moment on its home turf.\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nThree-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jurrell Casey was the last of the Titans defense introduced before kickoff for Tennessee's game against New England.\n\nCasey took the field carrying an American flag, and first shaking hands with a soldier as part of the NFL's Salute to Service being held on Veteran's Day. A soldier accompanied each Titans starter onto the field for a few steps.\n\nCountry artist Little Big Town performed the national anthem, which featured a flyover by military helicopters.\n\n___\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nDrew Brees and Tom Brady enter Week 10 of the NFL's schedule neck and neck in closing in on matching Brett Favre for second place on the career regular-season list.\n\nBrees has 506 touchdowns passing, two behind Favre, as the New Orleans Saints play at Cincinnati. And Brady has 505 with his New England Patriots playing at Tennessee. Both are a little more than 30 behind Peyton Manning's record of 539.\n\nBrady does have chance to pass Manning on the career touchdowns passing list, including playoffs. Manning has 579, only three more than Brady.\n\nOn the other end of the quarterback matchup spectrum Sunday, the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets will feature a battle of the backups rather than far more intriguing AFC East showdown of two rookie first-round picks.\n\nMatt Barkley is starting in place of Buffalo's Josh Allen, who will miss his fourth straight game with a sprained throwing elbow. For New York, Josh McCown is starting in place Sam Darnold, who is sidelined by a strained right foot. Darnold was drafted third overall, four spots ahead of Allen.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Dennis Waszak Jr.) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 An airplane banner criticizing the New York Jets' gaming deal partnership with casino operator MGM Resorts International circled MetLife Stadium several times a few hours before the team's game against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe banner trailing the plane Sunday read: \"SHAME ON JETS/MGM #ENDGUNVIOLENCE #STOPMGM.\"\n\nThe Jets and Las Vegas-based MGM announced two weeks ago they agreed on a multiyear deal that is the first of its kind in the NFL. MGM Resorts is now the official gaming partner of the Jets. The agreement is the most comprehensive and integrated gaming partnership in the league, and the first to go beyond a casino sponsorship.\n\n\"We wholeheartedly agree that our country needs to put an end to gun violence,\" MGM Resorts International said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Jets had no comment on the banner.\n\nIn July, MGM sued more than 1,900 victims of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in a bid not for money, but to avoid liability for the gunfire that rained down from a lone gunman at its Mandalay Bay casino-resort in October 2017.\n\nEarly last month, a panel of federal judges denied a request from MGM to centralize 13 lawsuits stemming from the shooting. MGM had asked to centralize the cases after it filed nine lawsuits in various states against the over 1,900 victims, but said it respected the ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and would litigate its motions in the courts where the actions were pending.\n\nMGM said at the time that its lawsuits are to avoid years of costly litigation and were focused only on people who have sued the company and voluntarily dismissed their claims or have threatened to sue.\n\nLate last month, MGM and the plaintiff's attorneys agreed to stay all pending litigation and entered into mediation. All litigation was suspended while the sides attempt to mediate a settlement.\n\n\"Our goal has always been to resolve these matters fairly and promptly, and we and the plaintiffs have asked the courts to suspend all litigation so we can enter into mediation and attempt to reach a resolution,\" MGM said in a statement to the AP. \"We hope for a positive outcome so all of those impacted can look forward to the future and continue in their healing.\"\n\nA few New York-area politicians had recently slammed the Jets' partnership on social media, citing the initial lawsuit by MGM.\n\nNew York State Sen. Kevin Parker from Brooklyn wrote on Twitter: \"I strongly disagree with @nyjets partnering with @MGMResortsIntl. The @MGMResortsIntl decision to sue the victims of the Mandalay Bay Shooting in Las Vegas is a complete disgrace! The @nyjets SHOULD NOT move forward #STOPMGM.\"\n\nAdded N.Y. State Sen. Luis Sepulveda from the Bronx: \"Shame on the @nyjets for partnering with @MGMResortsIntl who decided to sue the victims of the Mandalay Bay Shooting in Las Vegas. I urge folks to boycott the team until they end the partnership. #StopMGM.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In a mostly upset-free week, the top 11 teams remain the same with a only one minor position change.\n\nAlabama continues to lead the field. The Crimson Tide once again received all but one first-place vote from the 65 coaches on the panel following a second consecutive shutout of a ranked opponent, this time Mississippi State. Clemson prevailed on the road at Boston College and holds down the No. 2 spot keeping the remaining first-place vote. Notre Dame, Michigan and Georgia hold steady in the top five with Oklahoma staying put at No. 6 after surviving a wild Bedlam shootout with Oklahoma State.\n\nWest Virginia edges ahead of Ohio State into the No. 7 spot. The Mountaineers handled TCU at home while the Buckeyes prevailed in a defensive struggle on the road at Michigan State. Washington State, LSU and Central Florida retain the next three places.\n\nStock up: Iowa State. The Cyclones make the biggest move within the top 25, gaining seven places to No. 18 following a win against Baylor that keeps them in the Big 12 championship hunt.\n\nStock down: Kentucky. The voters were kind to the Wildcats last week after a loss to Georgia, but a second setback at unranked Tennessee caused a nine-place drop to No. 21.\n\nStock up: Texas. The Longhorns needed a late score to survive Texas Tech\u2019s comeback, but they climb five places to No. 14 as a result of the win.\n\nStock down: Mississippi State. As mentioned, the Bulldogs aren\u2019t the first team to be blanked by Alabama. But their 6-4 record couldn\u2019t be overlooked by the voters, who dropped them eight positions to No. 23.\n\nStock up: Alabama-Birmingham. In a remarkable development for a program coming back from being shut down, the Blazers are in the top 25 for the first time in history. UAB clinched the Conference USA West title, outlasting Southern Mississippi in overtime Saturday, in just the second year of the program\u2019s rebirth.\n\nStock down: Boston College.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Lionel Messi scored twice on his return from a broken arm but Barcelona conceded four goals and was reduced to 10 men in a 4-3 home defeat to Real Betis in the Spanish league on Sunday.\n\nThe loss ended an unbeaten run of 42 consecutive home games for Barcelona in the league dating back to a 2-1 defeat to Alaves on Sept. 10, 2016.\n\nMessi also helped set up a goal by substitute Arturo Vidal, but the league leaders were always trailing after Junior Firpo opened the scoring in the 20th minute.\n\nMessi returned to the field at Camp Nou three weeks after he broke a bone in his right forearm during a win over Sevilla. Barcelona won four games and drew one without him, including a 5-1 rout of Real Madrid.\n\n\"We came from a run of very good games and results in which we were all playing well but we were lacking something overall (on Sunday),\" said Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde. \"They won the match in the first half.\"\n\nBarcelona hadn't lost at home in any competition since Valverde's debut in the Spanish Super Cup at the start of the 2017-18 season, when it lost 3-1 to Real Madrid.\n\nBarcelona's second league loss of the season left it one point ahead of Atletico Madrid, which it visits next round after an international break. Espanyol can pull level on points with Barcelona if it beats Sevilla later Sunday.\n\nBetis undid Barcelona by pressing high up the pitch and mounting quick attacks.\n\nJoaquin Sanchez made it 2-0 for Betis before halftime. After Messi pulled one back from the penalty spot, Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen let a shot by Giovani Lo Celso slip through his hands to restore Betis' two-goal cushion.\n\nMessi briefly rekindled the comeback in the 79th when he threaded a pass forward for substitute Munir El Haddadi, who laid off for Vidal to reduce the deficit to 3-2.\n\nBut Barcelona was left with 10 men in the 82nd when Ivan Rakitic earned a second booking for a hard tackle on Lo Celso. A minute later Firpo led another attack for Betis from the left flank, passing for substitute Sergio Canales to slide and push his cross home.\n\nMessi scored his second goal deep in stoppage time. The Argentina forward leads the competition along with teammate Luis Suarez with nine goals each.\n\nBetis rose to 12th after its first win in five rounds.\n\n\"We played a great match against a great team,\" Betis coach Quique Setien said. \"We showed our character and knew how to read the match perfectly.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Andre Penner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Ten years ago at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Felipe Massa thought he was Formula One world champion \u2014 for 23 seconds at least.\n\nAfter winning his home race at Interlagos, Ferrari driver Massa appeared to have done enough to become the first Brazilian to win the title since Ayrton Senna in 1991.\n\nBut premature celebrations by Ferrari and Massa in his cockpit suddenly ended when Hamilton, then a McLaren driver, climbed to fifth place on the last turn of the race. That proved sufficient for Hamilton to secure his first title in Sao Paulo in 2008 and overcome his disappointing performance at Interlagos a year earlier which saw the title going to Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.\n\nA decade later, Hamilton is the newly crowned five-time champion and in pole position for Sunday's race. Massa is a TV pundit preparing for the Formula E season. The two former adversaries talked about the old days in the paddock and roamed around the track with other drivers in a truck.\n\n\"I didn't lose the 2008 title in Brazil,\" Massa said. \"I won it (the race), but nothing else depended on me 10 years ago. Winning actually made me less frustrated because I did all I could. Hamilton won the title because of his great season, not because of his fifth place at Interlagos.\"\n\nHamilton remembers that Brazilian fans \"were a bit difficult\" after that race, with the British driver clinching the title after a last-minute overtake of Toyota's Timo Glock.\n\n\"The relationship with Brazil had ups and downs, but now it is just great,\" said Hamilton.\n\nThe 37-year-old Massa, who retired from F1 last year without ever winning the title, says personal and team mistakes a decade ago made all the difference at the end of one of the most exciting seasons of the series.\n\n\"In Singapore I didn't get any points, finished 13th. In Hungary I was leading and my engine broke just two laps before the checkered flag. So at Interlagos it wasn't really that likely I could be champion in the end,\" the Brazilian said.\n\nAsked whether he would like to be competing still, Massa joked \"if that meant running for Williams once again, I think it is best not to be racing.\"\n\nMassa's former team is 10th in the constructors' championship with only seven points.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Alibaba)\n\nAlibaba on Sunday tore through last year's Singles Day sales record, racking up more than $30.8 billion in the 24-hour shopping event.\n\nGross merchandise value (GMV), a figure that shows sales across the Chinese e-commerce giant's various shopping platforms, surpassed last year's $25.3 billion record at around 5:34 p.m. SIN/HK (4:34 a.m. ET) on Sunday, and kept marching higher through the rest of the day.\n\nIn Chinese currency terms, GMV totaled 213.5 billion yuan, easily beating last year's figure of 168.2 billion yuan and representing a nearly 27 percent year-on-year rise. That was, however, smaller than the 39 percent year-on-year growth recorded in 2017.\n\nAlibaba's Singles Day GMV beat last year's figure in yuan terms earlier than it toppled the dollar record. The Chinese currency is weaker against the greenback from a year ago, which means more sales in yuan are required to get the same dollar amount.\n\nMore Money: Singles Day has become a multibillion-dollar mega-event. Here's how it got so big\n\nMore Money: Kroger teams with Amazon rival Alibaba to sell groceries in China\n\nMore Money: Alibaba's Jack Ma says it can't create 1 million jobs in U.S. due to Trump's China tariffs\n\nIt was the 10th edition of the annual Singles Day event, which is also called the Double 11 shopping festival because it falls on Nov. 11. During the 24-hour period, Alibaba offered huge discounts across its e-commerce sites such as Tmall.\n\nAlibaba's Singles Day sales haul easily exceeded the spending by consumers during any single U.S. shopping holiday.\n\nThe event got off to a strong start with sales hitting $1 billion in one minute and 25 seconds. Just over an hour in, and sales exceeded $10 billion, five minutes and 21 seconds faster than last year. The number of delivery orders surpassed a billion.\n\nAlibaba introduced new aspects into this year's Singles Day. Lazada, a Singapore-based e-commerce site that has operations across Southeast Asia and is majority-owned by Alibaba, hosted its own sales. And Ele.me, Alibaba's food delivery platform, provided delivery for select Starbucks stores across 11 Chinese cities. Starbucks struck a deal earlier this year with Alibaba to work together in China.\n\nNew Retail Focus\n\nAlibaba hosted a gala featuring celebrities including Miranda Kerr and Mariah Carey which kicked off on Saturday and went through to the end of the 11:11 event. Company founder Jack Ma also made an appearance at the media event which marked the start of Singles Day, but he did not give a speech.\n\nThe Chinese giant is putting a big focus this year on a strategy it calls \"new retail,\" which aims to bring together the online parts of its business with the offline. For example, it has a chain of grocery stores called Hema which allow users to go in and shop, pay with their phone and walk out. The Starbucks deal is part of the new retail strategy.\n\n\"When we talk about new retail, we strongly believe that online commercial world and offline brick mortars are not separate worlds. And if you look at the customer base today, everyone is living in the internet. Everybody is the internet user. You have the same customer base. You must have the same commercial world. It's all about how to innovate online and offline to a whole digitalized commercial world,\" Zhang told CNBC.\n\nSingles Day could provide some relief to investors amid concerns that the U.S.-China trade war and stock market drops in the mainland have hit Chinese consumer appetite. Alibaba is facing a number of headwinds with shares down nearly 16 percent this year due to weakening investors sentiment towards Chinese technology companies because of the trade war. And the company recently cut its revenue guidance for the fiscal year.\n\nAhead of Singles Day, Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba told CNBC in an exclusive interview that aired earlier this week, that the U.S.-China trade tensions could be an opportunity for the firm.\n\n\"Well, I would say nobody likes trade war and nobody likes the uncertainty of the economic condition. But what we always do is that to try to find opportunities in the tough time. If people have some pain points, this means some opportunities. How to help people in the tough time to get more business, not only in China but also in the global markets,\" Zhang told CNBC.\n\n\"For Alibaba, we always think about our mission, which is make it easy to do business anywhere. I think it's more relevant today in this condition,\" he added.\n\nAlibaba also pledged last week to help businesses sell $200 billion worth of goods to China in the next five years.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/11/alibaba-sets-singles-day-record-beating-black-friday-and-others/1967659002/", "The Bills invited Ezra Castro, more commonly known as the super fan Pancho Billa, to address the players Saturday night.\n\nIt may get dusty where you are.\n\nHe's an inspiration to so many and it's a moment we'll never forget.

(AP) \u2014 Louisville's seven-game skid was bad enough. Worse were the large margins of defeat and opponents' apparent ease in lighting up the scoreboard.\n\nThat combination spelled the end of coach Bobby Petrino's second chapter with the Cardinals.\n\nLouisville fired Petrino on Sunday morning with two games left in a spiraling season that includes five blowout losses in which the Cardinals allowed at least 50 points.\n\nThe school announced Petrino's dismissal with a statement from athletic director Vince Tyra, who wasn't confident the coach could turn things around next season. He said a new head coach would be chosen soon to restore the program to national prominence.\n\nThe AD said at a news conference later that he considered a number of factors in Petrino's status, but noted that the three games since Louisville's bye showed no progress.\n\n\"It was clear the players weren't responding,\" he said. \"The coaches' and the players' efforts have to go in the right direction, but I didn't feel it was going that way.\"\n\nPurdue head coach Jeff Brohm, a former Louisville quarterback who later became an assistant under Petrino, has frequently been mentioned as the top candidate to replace him. Tyra said he had \"a list in mind\" but didn't want to interfere with potential candidates with the season still in progress.\n\nFor now, second-year safeties coach Lorenzo Ward, 51, would coach Louisville on an interim basis.\n\nAlso let go were quarterbacks coach Nick Petrino, the coach's son; linebackers coach Ryan Beard and defensive line coach L.D. Scott, Petrino's sons-in-law; and fifth-year director of football operations Andy Wagner.\n\nLouisville (2-8) lost 54-23 at No. 12 Syracuse on Friday night, dropping to 0-7 in Atlantic Coast Conference play.\n\nPetrino, 57, departs with a 77-35 mark in two stints with Louisville, including 36-26 since returning in 2014. His exit will be expensive for Louisville, which owes him $14 million under terms of his contract extension signed in April 2016. Tyra said Petrino would receive the full buyout.\n\nThe school was left with little choice but to release Petrino with Louisville struggling and sections of empty seats at Cardinal Stadium recently after opening a new north end section in a $63 million renovation project.\n\nLouisville's stunning freefall comes a season after 2016 Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson capped one of the program's most remarkable periods under the offense-minded Petrino. Besides becoming the school's first Heisman winner, Jackson had the program as high as No. 3 in The Associated Press Top 25 and within reach of the College Football Playoff at No. 5 that November.\n\nBut other than sharing the 2016 Atlantic Division title with Clemson, Louisville wasn't a consistent ACC contender after leaving the Big East.\n\nThis season, the Cardinals have failed to beat a Power Five school and needed second-half rallies to beat FCS Indiana State and Western Kentucky.\n\nAn offensive falloff was expected following the departure of the dynamic Jackson, who broke numerous school and conference records before being selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of last spring's NFL Draft.\n\nHowever, Jackson's exit ended up revealing a host of deficiencies as Louisville struggled to score. The Cardinals rank at or near the bottom of several ACC offensive categories and Petrino has shuffled quarterbacks Jawon Pass and Malik Cunningham.\n\nTheir defensive weaknesses have been more glaring and left them looking up at the rest of the ACC statistically. The Cardinals have been outscored 291-125 in that span, including a 77-16 thumping at No. 2 Clemson on Nov. 3.\n\nPetrino remained hopeful of improvement, but another lopsided loss ended with him being shown the door.\n\nThe Montana native is 119-56 overall in a college career that included stops at Arkansas and WKU. He also coached 13 games with the NFL's Atlanta Falcons in 2007. His career has included a lot of wins and some controversy and hard feelings left behind.\n\nHe was 31-9 with Louisville from 2003-06, taking the Cardinals to the Orange Bowl, while also constantly coming up as a candidate for other jobs. He left college for the Falcons and lasted less than a season before taking the Arkansas job.\n\nThat ended with embarrassment. He was fired after getting into a motorcycle accident, which exposed an extra-marital affair with an athletic department employee and Petrino's lies to his boss.\n\nPetrino resurfaced at WKU for the 2103 season before Louisville gave him another chance. Then-athletic director Tom Jurich re-hired Petrino as the program transitioned from the Big East to the ACC.\n\nBut Jurich is gone as part of the fallout from a series of scandals involving the men's basketball program that also felled Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino.\n\nPetrino is now out as well, leaving Tyra to make his second major coaching hire after basketball coach Chris Mack in March. In the meantime, Ward must close the season on a high note that proved elusive for Petrino and the Cardinals.\n\n\"Talent-wise, we've got enough to win with,\" Tyra said. \"There's a lot to build on in terms of skill and I'm excited about that part of it. But we've got to draw it out of them and teach them what it's like to play their (butt) off in a Cardinal uniform.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He thought I was angry. I wasn't. Now I'm angry because I lost, but I wasn't, so...\"\n\nFederer earned the first break points in the opening game of the second set, and took his chance, but Nishikori hit straight back in the following game.\n\nNishikori was the far more composed player from that moment on and broke for a 4-2 lead, before closing out the match for a first win over Federer since 2014.\n\n\"It's always a big challenge to play Roger,\" Nishikori said. \"The first match is not easy.\"\n\nSix-time champion Federer, who has reached the semifinals in all but one of his 15 previous appearances at the tournament, will now likely need to win his remaining two round-robin matches to keep alive his chances of claiming the 100th title of his career.\n\nMore thanks to poor returning than good serving, neither man was able to create so much as a sniff of a break of serve in an error-strewn opening set, until Nishikori's backhand denied Federer two set points with the score at 6-5, 15-30.\n\nA tiebreaker followed and Federer made one of his 20 unforced errors in the set to give Nishikori the first mini-break and a 3-1 lead, which quickly became 6-1.\n\nFederer rallied to save three set points, but Nishikori delivered a well-placed serve out wide to ensure the comeback attempt ended there.\n\nHowever, his concentration deserted him moments later as a double fault gave Federer a break he did little to earn. But the Swiss responded in kind and a wild forehand error leveled the score at 1-1.\n\n\"Unfortunately I couldn't keep the lead that I got early (in the second set),\"Federer said. \"That was the key of the match, that sort of 10-minute swing at the end of the first through to maybe 1-1 in the second.\"\n\nThe seventh-seeded Nishikori began to relax and was rewarded in the sixth game as he brought up another break point and produced an inside-out forehand Federer had no chance of returning.\n\nDespite having lost his last six meetings with Federer, including two on this court, Nishikori showed no nerves as he dropped just one point in his next two service games, with a forehand error from the Swiss great ending the match.\n\nEarlier, Kevin Anderson made a confident start to his ATP Finals debut with a 6-3, 7-6 (10) victory over Dominic Thiem.\n\nHaving qualified for the tournament for the first time, the 32-year-old Anderson produced a dominant serving display to take the first set, before saving two set points to come through a tense tiebreaker in the second.\n\n\"I think it was important, you know, going out there and getting off to a good start,\" Anderson said. \"I definitely felt a little bit nervous.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Trump named Whitaker as the interim attorney general after Jeff Sessions' ouster last week.\n\n\"The appointment of Mr. Whitaker should concern every American \u2013 Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative \u2013 who believes in rule of law and justice,\" Schumer said during an interview Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"He has already prejudged the Mueller situation. If he stays there, he will create a constitutional crisis by inhibiting Mueller or firing Mueller, so Congress has to act.\"\n\nSchumer cited Whitaker's public comments that he does not believe Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that the funding to Mueller's inquiry should be cut as examples of why Whitaker should not be in charge of the special counsel's investigation.\n\nHe said Democratic leaders in the House and Senate plan to send a letter to the chief ethics officer of the Justice Department asking for an opinion on whether Whitaker should recuse himself from the investigation.\n\nIf Whitaker does not recuse, Schumer said, Democrats in both houses of Congress will \"attempt to add to must-pass legislation, in this case the spending bill, legislation that would prevent Mr. Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation.\"\n\n\"State of the Union\" host Jake Tapper pointed out that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated he wouldn't support legislation to protect Mueller. Tapper asked Schumer if Democrats would risk a shutdown and refuse to sign a spending bill that didn't include protection for Mueller.\n\n\"Look, I believe there will be enough of our Republican colleagues who will join us. There's no reason we shouldn't add this and avoid a constitutional crisis,\" Schumer replied. If Republican support fails to materialize, \"we'll see what happens down the road,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that McConnell said he didn't think such legislation was necessary before Sessions was fired because there was no concern that Mueller's investigation would be interfered with when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein oversaw it.\n\n\"With Whitaker, there is every reason to believe there will be interference, based on what Mr. Whitaker has said. The world has changed from when Rosenstein was in charge of the investigation, and I think, I believe, that many Republicans will find the same,\" Schumer said.\n\nMcConnell repeated his position Friday that legislation to protect Mueller would not be brought to the full Senate for a vote after outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called for such a bill.\n\n\"It's not going to come up because it isn't necessary,\" McConnell said in Frankfort, Kentucky.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation is not under threat. The president has said repeatedly he's not going to dismiss the Mueller investigation,\" McConnell said. He said the president had the authority to appoint Whitaker, whom he expected to be a \"very interim\" attorney general.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is likely to take over the powerful House Judiciary Committee in January, told Tapper that protecting Mueller from Whitaker, whom he derided as a \"complete political lackey,\" will be his top priority.\n\nNadler said Whitaker would be the \"very first witness after Jan. 3\" \u2013 when the new Congress begins \u2013 after being summoned or, if necessary, subpoenaed, to address how he could supervise Mueller when he has said \"the investigation is invalid.\"\n\nNadler said Whitaker is \"totally unqualified\" to lead the Justice Department and Trump wants him in charge only \"to be the hatchet man to destroy the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, who will probably become chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on \"Meet the Press\" that the case for Whitaker's recusal from the Mueller investigation is \"very strong.\"\n\nThe California Democrat warned Whitaker that \"if he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe, we are going to find out, whether he made commitments to the president about the probe, whether he is serving as a back channel to the president or his lawyers about the probe, whether he's doing anything to interfere with the probe.\"\n\n\"Mr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer, and any role he plays will be exposed to the public,\" Schiff said.\n\nOn CNN, Tapper asked Nadler and Schumer if they believed the president should be impeached. Both Democrats said they would wait for the results of Mueller's report before making that determination.\n\nNadler said that for impeachment to move forward, the evidence against Trump would have to be so overwhelming that even many Republicans would agree it was necessary.\n\nOtherwise, \"half the country says for the next 30 years, 'We won the election, you stole it.' \"\n\nNadler denied media reports that he was considering impeachment proceedings against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who Nadler suggested gave false testimony during his confirmation hearings. Nadler said he supported an inquiry into whether the FBI was able to conduct a thorough investigation into sexual assault allegations that Kavanaugh denied.\n\nOn \"Meet The Press,\" Schiff conceded that there was a risk that the new Democratic majority in the House could overreach by conducting inquiries into the president.\n\n\"Our strongest purpose here is to put forward a positive agenda, and we don't want that lost in a flurry of investigations,\" he said.

The remaining two matches were not played.\n\nIt was the first victory for the Czechs over the United States \u2014 since the country was created after the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 \u2014 after four defeats in the Fed Cup.\n\nThe Czechoslovakia team that won five Fed Cup titles was 2-6 against the U.S.\n\n\"It was an unbelievable match for me,\" Siniakova said. \"It was up and down, with nerves. I'm extremely happy that I won. I thank all who came for their support. It was felt.\"\n\nU.S. captain Kathy Rinaldi said she was proud of her team despite the loss.\n\n\"We didn't get the result that we wanted but nobody can say we didn't give all out there,\" Rinaldi said after her first loss as the captain.\n\n\"That match today, both girls, both players were incredible,\" she said. \"I'm so honored to have been part of that match, they really fought hard, the points were incredible, it's just something I never forget.\"\n\nIn a hard-fought match at the O2 Arena, the 22-year-old Siniakova saved two match points when Kenin was serving at 5-4, and went on to convert her second match point on the indoor hardcourt in front of 14,500 fans.\n\n\"It was a long match, a lot of points, a lot of effort, long points,\" Kenin said. \"We fought hard till the end. It's disappointing for me 'cause I had like two match points but couldn't turn things around. But I fought my hardest and I did everything I could.\"\n\nSiniakova wasted a 3-0 lead in the final set and the 19-year-old Kenin, who was playing her second match in her debut Fed Cup tie, fought back.\n\nKenin, who wasted three break points at 5-5, hit 43 winners but also made 76 unforced errors. Siniakova hit 24 winners.\n\n\"It was horrible, the worst (moment),\" Siniakova said about the match points she faced. \"But it's not the end until the final match point is converted.\"\n\nAt 3-0 down in the third set, Kenin needed treatment for what seemed to be a thigh muscle problem. The treatment was then repeated several times.\n\n\"It was obviously painful for me and I felt like it was just hard for me to move,\" Kenin said.\n\nTrailing 3-1, the American wasted five break points in a game that took 19 minutes.\n\nOn Saturday, Barbora Strycova rallied for a 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-4 victory over Kenin to put the Czechs 1-0 ahead and Siniakova doubled the advantage with a 6-3, 7-6 (2) win over Alison Riske.\n\nThe U.S. is the most successful country in the international team competition and won its 18th Fed Cup title last year with Rinaldi in her first season as the captain. The U.S. had not previously won the Fed Cup since 2000.\n\nOn the way to the final, the Czechs beat Switzerland 3-1 in the first round and Germany 4-1 in the semifinals.\n\nThe final was marred by the absence of top players.\n\nSiniakova was the highest ranked at No. 31.\n\nAfter four of the top five U.S. women in the WTA singles rankings \u2014 the Williams sisters, Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys \u2014 decided to skip it, three players on the team made their Fed Cup debuts.\n\nThe Czechs were weakened, too, missing their two top-10 players. Karolina Pliskova was ruled out due to injuries and Petra Kvitova due to illness.\n\nInternational Tennis Federation President David Haggerty said in Prague the ITF would like to have more top players in the competition in general.\n\n\"One of the concepts is to do something similar to what we've done with the Davis Cup. Nothing is determined (yet),\" he said.\n\nHaggerty said the ITF would like to expand the Fed Cup World Group to 16 teams from the current eight because \"some of the top players are on the teams that are maybe nine through 16.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas. Unveiled in March 2018, Symphony measures 228,081 gross tons, a new record for a cruise vessel. (Photo: Royal Caribbean)\n\nThe new world's largest cruise ship has made its first call in Mexico.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's giant Symphony of the Seas on Sunday arrived at the beach-lined Mexican island of Cozumel, the Caribbean's busiest cruise port, for a day-long visit.\n\nThe 228,081-ton vessel is on its maiden voyage from Miami, its new year-round home. It's a special four-night sailing during which Cozumel is the only stop.\n\nSymphony departed Miami late Friday under a fusillade of fireworks that lit up the city's waterfront, part of a welcome celebration that also included a fire boat spraying water high into the air. Soaring 18 decks high and nearly 1,200 feet long, Symphony is the largest cruise ship ever to sail out of PortMiami, the world's busiest cruise port.\n\nLocal media in Cozumel was waiting for Symphony on Sunday for what they called a historic visit. The ship will be visiting Cozumel regularly starting later this month when it begins seven-night voyages to the Western Caribbean.\n\nUnveiled earlier this year in Europe, Symphony is built on the same platform as Royal Caribbean's 2-year-old Harmony of the Seas, the previous size leader in cruising. But it eclipses its sibling by more than 1,000 tons and offers several new features.\n\nAmong additions are a first-of-its-kind, two-deck-high family suite with a slide between floors, a revamped Boardwalk amusement area and a new laser tag attraction. Symphony also has more cabins than Harmony.\n\nWhile Symphony spent its first few months sailing in Europe, it only was a temporary assignment. The resort-like vessel has long been scheduled to sail in the Caribbean year-round starting this month. The ship arrived in Miami on Friday after a 12-night voyage from Barcelona. The arrival came a day after the vessel made a brief stop at Port Canaveral, Florida \u2014 its first call in North America.\n\nSymphony's official coming out party in North America will take place Thursday in Miami when it is christened by actors and mega-cruise fans Carlos and Alexa PenaVega, along with their one-old son Ocean.\n\nRELATED: Five things to love about Symphony of the Seas | Why we love giant cruise ships like Symphony | Yes, an even bigger sister to Symphony is on the way\n\nDesigned for vacationers who love big, bustling mega-resorts, Symphony boasts one of the highest concentrations of attractions for both adults and children at sea. Like its sister Harmony, it has a record-breaking thrill slide that plunges nearly 100 feet and a \"bionic bar\" with a robot bartender. It also offers three main pool areas, a water slide complex, an adults-only solarium, an ice skating rink, two rock climbing walls, a basketball court and a mall-like indoor promenade with shops, bars and eateries. Like Harmony, it also has an open-air, tree-lined area called Central Park with restaurants, bars and upscale shops such as Bulgari.\n\nSymphony can hold up to 6,680 passengers and sails with a crew of 2,200, meaning that on busy weeks it can be home to nearly 9,000 people. It was constructed over three years at the giant Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in St. Nazaire, France \u2014 the same shipyard that built Harmony. Its reported cost was more than $1.3 billion.\n\nWith the addition of Symphony of the Seas, Royal Caribbean has 25 ships.\n\nFABULOUS PHOTOS: The world's 25 biggest cruise ships\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/11/11/royal-caribbean-symphony-seas-worlds-largest-cruise-ship-calls-mexico/1967098002/", "CLOSE Can Alabama stay undefeated?

But he said he and others in France \"like what he is doing in the United States\" in terms of jobs and economic growth.\n\nStill, let's face it: The French are never going to be particularly fond of the U.S. president.\n\nTrump received a cold welcome this week from Parisians who don't like his views on immigration and climate change, and aren't crazy about his boisterous style, either.\n\nMore: Amid criticism, President Donald Trump meets French counterpart Emmanuel Macron\n\nMore: Macron, world leaders rebuke 'nationalism' at World War I event attended by Trump\n\nBefore Sunday's World War I commemoration at the Arc de Triomphe, a topless woman ran toward Trump's motorcade before being caught by police.

A blimp of \"Baby Trump,\" swathed in a diaper, hovered overhead.\n\nThe protests did seem more muted compared with the president's visit in 2017.\n\nSome Paris residents noted that Trump was more a focus last year because he was a special guest of French President Emmanuel Macron at the annual Bastille Day parade.\n\nThis time, Trump was among more than 60 world leaders attending events marking the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I. Paris has paid more attention to the solemn war memorial than to the American president.\n\nSome Parisians acknowledged that Democratic presidents like Barack Obama tend to be more popular with them than Republican ones because of their left-leaning politics. They also said there's something about Trump \u2013 the avatar of an \"America First\" foreign policy who has clashed with Macron and threatened to pull support from the NATO military alliance \u2013 that really drives the French up a wall.\n\nAt an outdoor table at Cafe de Paris, not far from the Arc de Triomphe, 25-year-old Alice Marty criticized Trump for saying that a caravan of migrants from Central America, fleeing their home countries to escape poverty, violence and corruption, planned \"an invasion\" of the United States.\n\n\"I just don't like him,\" said Marty, who grew up in Paris but now lives in Berlin. \"I think he's really rude ... with regard to women, disrespectful ... racist, maybe.\"\n\nAccording to a recent Odoxa poll for Le Figaro newspaper, 65 percent of the French public disapproved of Trump \u2013 though that is a better number than the 81 percent disapproval rating Trump pulled in the same poll last year.\n\nOn the other hand, only 10 percent of the French said they had a positive image of Trump; another 25 percent had no opinion.\n\nTrump has said he doesn't care about ratings with residents of other countries.

The Egypt forward has 34 goals in 36 appearances at Anfield since joining Liverpool in the offseason of 2017.\n\nIt was a seventh straight loss for Fulham in all competitions, keeping the pressure on manager Slavisa Jokanovic heading into the two-week international break. The London team's only win since returning to the Premier League was in late August and it hasn't scored a goal in its last three league losses.\n\nWhile Salah could yet match his prolific scoring from last season, when he finished as the league's top scorer with 32 goals, two more factors are making Liverpool a more irresistible force as the team looks to become English champion for a 19th time \u2014 and first since 1990.\n\nBought from relegated Stoke for 13 million pounds ($17.2 million), Shaqiri is proving to be an astute offseason purchase by manager Juergen Klopp, with the playmaker mostly being used for the easier matches to give Liverpool some creativity when faced with packed defenses. In the past three weeks, he has set up the winner for Salah at Huddersfield, scored at home to Cardiff and now Fulham.\n\nLiverpool also has rarely been as resolute at the back: This was its seventh clean sheet in the league, with the team yet to concede more than one goal in a game.\n\n\"We scored a lot of goals last season,\" Robertson said, \"but this season we have been solid at the back as well.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It is the most destructive fire in state history.\n\nThe dense smoke Saturday limited the use of aircraft fighting the Camp Fire, officials said.\n\nHonea cautioned people to continue to remain vigilant.\n\n\"We have another one to two days of strong winds with the potential to create explosive fire behavior similar to the conditions that occurred Thursday (the day the fire started),\" Honea said.\n\nCal Fire officials said the Woolsey Fire has burned 130 square miles and destroyed 177 structures. The fire was 5 percent contained as of Saturday night\n\nA brief respite in the high winds Saturday gave firefighters a chance to control the edges of the blazes and to swap crews, replacing firefighters who had worked for two days without rest, said Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby.\n\nBut with the winds expected to reach 40 mph gusts on Sunday, it\u2019s likely more homes would be lost, Osby warned. Ventura County Fire Department Chief Mark Lorenzen said the devastating Santa Ana winds could last through Tuesday.\n\n\"Don't be lulled by a false sense of security,\" said Lorenzen in a press conference Saturday evening. \"Right now mother nature has given us a short reprieve. The winds are not blowing. But we know tomorrow Mother Nature is going to turn her fan back on.\"\n\nOsby said Saturday that his firefighters were reporting \"conditions they have never seen in their lives.\" He said that aircraft dropped large amounts of fire retardant on fire zones to help prevent further spread.\n\n\"We did lose a lot of homes,\" he said. \"But we saved thousands of homes.\"\n\nHe said firefighters' objectives for Saturday included perimeter control along the 101 freeway, and in Bell Canyon and Malibu Canyon. He said that crew would be hand-digging containment lines in Malibu and Topanga Canyon overnight.\n\nBenedict told reporters that he had 200 officers on patrol for \"looting suppression.\" He warned that his department would have \"zero tolerance\" for stealing.\n\nTwo people have been arrested so far on suspicion of looting, according to Sgt. Eric Buschow of the Ventura County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"If you come here with the intent of taking advantage of this situation, we will arrest you and you will go to jail,\" Buschow said.\n\nAt Pepperdine University in Malibu, classes were canceled Saturday after a tense Friday evening. When the all-clear order was given around 9 a.m. Saturday, many students drove away from the area, many equipped with face masks.\n\nDespite the evacuation order for Malibu, Hassen Masri, who lives in the Malibu Country Estates neighborhood that abuts the university, stayed in his house Friday night and watched the hills rage with fire around him.\n\nAround midnight, he saw nearly 20 trucks pull onto the Pepperdine University campus once officials learned the students wouldn't be evacuating.\n\n\"It was a hairy experience; it was bad, it was really bad,\" Masri said. \"When the fire came over the ridge around midnight, I thought I should leave, but I didn't. Maybe it was crazy that the university didn't remove the students, but I am thankful for the extra resources that brought. I felt protected by those extra trucks.\"\n\nThe exotic animals at Ronnie Semler\u2019s Saddlerock Ranch, including zebras and water buffalo, were roaming their corrals Saturday even though a structure that appeared to be a barn, several vehicles and fences burned. The Malibu ranch\u2019s biggest attraction, Stanley the giraffe, appeared happy and curious. Except for one worker, the ranch appeared empty.\n\nIn Paris, President Donald Trump issued an emergency declaration providing federal funds for Butte, Ventura and Los Angeles counties but later threatened on Twitter to withhold federal payments to California, claiming its forest management is \u201cso poor.\u201d\n\n\"Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests,\" he wrote. \"Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\nThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018\n\nLater Saturday, Trump tweeted again, urging residents to listen to evacuation orders from state and local officials.\n\n\"More than 4,000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170,000 acres. Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic.

The 45-year-old Englishman hadn't won anywhere for more than three years.\n\n\"I'm a bit emotional, to be honest,\" Westwood said, his voice breaking as he battled to hold back tears. \"You're never sure whether you're going to be able to do it again. Until now my emotions have felt really under control all day, which is what I've been working hard on.\"\n\nWestwood saved his best \u2014 as well as his tears \u2014 for last at Gary Player Country Club as the best round of the day and only the second 64 of the week saw him finish on 15 under overall, a three-shot win over Garcia (70), with Oosthuizen (69) third on 11 under.\n\nHe made an eagle on No. 2 and six birdies in all, five of them on the back nine, as he charged to his 24th European title and 43rd career victory in the penultimate event of the season. His birdies on Nos. 16 and 17, set up by pin-point iron play as the pressure mounted, settled a fascinating final-round battle between him, Garcia and Oosthuizen.\n\n\"I was just trying to hit fairways and stick to my game-plan and hit it in the right places, Westwood said. \"I've got a bit of a process that I'm going through with my golf swing and I'm starting to see better shots. The 7-iron into 17 is probably one of the best shots I've ever hit.\"\n\nGarcia had led from the start and had a two-shot advantage over Oosthuizen and was three ahead of Westwood after three rounds. But Westwood's finish proved irresistible.\n\nDown the stretch, Garcia couldn't make any birdies on the last six holes. Oosthuizen kept slipping up, with three bogeys and a double-bogey on the last to go with his eight birdies. Westwood didn't drop a shot all day.\n\nThe Nedbank Challenge also had repercussions for the Race to Dubai, with Rory McIlroy, Li Haotong and Lucas Bjerregaard now all officially out of the running to be crowned European No. 1 next weekend at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship.\n\nThat will now be a shootout between Race to Dubai standings leader Francesco Molinari and his Ryder Cup buddy Tommy Fleetwood after McIlroy finished in a tie for 21st in Sun City with a final-round 71, Li finished tied for fifth with a 65, and Bjerregaard tied for 11th after also closing with a 65.\n\nMcIlroy needed to finish in the top two to stay in contention for the season title while Li and Bjerregaard both needed to win in Sun City.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Only when you have your personal \"why\" for retirement will you actually execute a saving-and-investment strategy to get there.

(Photo: Darko Vojinovic, AP)\n\nHave you ever wanted to smash something after a long day at work?\n\nThere's a more grown-up way to throw a tantrum.\n\nRage rooms, also known as smash rooms or anger rooms, have opened in cities around the world, and they offer a safe place for people to shatter away their anger \u2013 literally. You can hurl a plate across a room, take a sledgehammer to an old computer or kiss a framed photo of your ex goodbye with a golf club.\n\nThe first rage room opened in Japan in 2008, according to Vice. Since then, rage rooms have spread to countries from Serbia to the United Kingdom to Argentina. There are hundreds of rage rooms in the USA, and new ones have popped up in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina, and Tuscon, Arizona, in the past year.\n\nIn October, rage rooms opened in Milwaukee; Rochester, New York; Hampton, Virginia; and American Fork, Utah.\n\nRage rooms are generally affordable, but like anything else, prices vary. In Glen Burnie, Maryland, you can pay as little as $15 for a BYOB package \u2013 that's bring your own breakable \u2013 if you want to destroy some keepsakes of your own. In New York City, you can pay $95 for the \"Couples Therapy\" package, which comes with two electronic items, such as a printer or laptop, and two buckets of dishes, such as ceramic plates, mugs and bowls. In Los Angeles, you can pay up to $300 for the \"Overkill\" package, which includes 100 items such as televisions, wine bottles and printers.\n\nMaxwell Luthy, director of trends and insights at TrendWatching, said rage rooms are unique because they allow consumers to make a memory instead of buying a product. The U.S. consumer base is increasingly stressed, according to Luthy, from the headaches of daily life, as well as issues such as climate change and politics.\n\n\"So you have an anxious consumer who needs to let off some steam, and this provides an experience for them,\" Luthy said. \"This is more substantial than a unicorn frappuccino.\"\n\nWhy go to a rage room?\n\nRage rooms are not just for when you're seeing red, according to Mary Babic, a co-owner of the Smash Room in Daytona Beach, Florida. She said customers have flocked to the smash room as a form of stress relief, not anger management.\n\n\"When we talk about, it, we literally just talk about relieving that pressure you didn\u2019t even know was there,\" Babic said. \"We actually talk about the fun of it.\"\n\nVantroy Greene, who opened the House of Purge in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May, said the need to relax unifies his clients.\n\n\"I feel like there\u2019s a lot of people who need an outlet from family stress or just the stress of life,\" Greene said. \"There\u2019s a lot of people who work out every day or pray or meditate, but you might like to break stuff. That first time you smash a bottle, you\u2019ll just get it.\"\n\nKaki King, a guitarist from New York City, visited Rage Industries in Seattle in October, while she was on tour. She said she was surprised that she enjoyed the experience, even though she does not think of herself as violent.\n\n\"I was the most surprised by the fact that someone like me \u2013 I consider myself calm, peaceful, measured, not quick to anger at all \u2013 (would) actually be expressing anger physically, even against these inanimate objects,\" she said.\n\nKing called her 20-minute session \"cathartic\" and even cried in the middle of it.\n\n\"I really got into it in a way I did not expect,\" King said.\n\nWhy are rage rooms so in demand?\n\nRage rooms have become so popular because they offer a new experience that anyone can enjoy, according to Greene. He has had more than 1,100 visitors since the House of Purge's opening in May, from bachelorette parties to company team-building events to families with children as young as 8 years old.\n\nHis most surprising clients? A 73-year-old couple who wanted to spend date night smashing a car.\n\n\"They were out there breaking stuff to opera music,\" Greene said. \"He was wearing a tux.\"\n\nBabic said another surprise has been that the majority of her customers are women, and Greene said women are up to \"95 percent\" of his.\n\n\"I would have assumed it would have been men,\" Babic said. \"It's funny how many women come in who never thought they would do it, but they want to relieve some stress, and they think that's a good way to do it.\"\n\nBabic said she has seen clients integrate rage rooms into their routines. She said some therapists recommend rage rooms to address anxiety. One man keeps a monthly appointment because of stress at work.\n\nSome mental health professionals doubt that rage rooms are an effective way of expressing anger. Scott Bea, a clinical psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said rage rooms can be fun, but they should not substitute communication or seeking help.\n\n\"It's not particularly therapeutic for people who have anger problems,\" Scott said. \"Just because they throw something doesn't mean they aren't going to throw something again in the future.\"\n\nKing said she embraced going to a rage room as a way of handling the pressures of adult life, adding it to her \"mental health regimen,\" like seeing a therapist.\n\n\"What's nice is the feeling of anonymity,\" King said. \"I don't think the business model is set up on judging people or being curious about what their intentions are. It's a safe place to destroy things.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/11/rage-rooms-what-might-surprise-you-growing-trend/1754653002/", "CLOSE French President Emmanual Macron delivers remarks on the armistice that ended WWI, and decries the 'nationalism' that he claims is resurfacing.

(Photo: Francois Mori, AP)\n\nPARIS \u2013 Bells tolled across France and Europe on Sunday as President Donald Trump and other global leaders gathered to honor the dead of World War I and heed its harsh lessons to prevent conflicts.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, who has criticized Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy, decried excessive \"nationalism\" at the root of World War I and successive conflicts.\n\n\"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" Macron told a gathering of world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Trump. \u201cNationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying, \u2018Our interest first, who cares about the others?\u2019 \"\n\nHosting an event to mark the centennial of the armistice that ended World War I, Macron told fellow leaders they have a \"huge responsibility\" to defeat modern forces that threaten a \"legacy of peace\" from the two world wars of the past century.\n\n\"I know there are old demons coming back to the surface,\" the French president said. \"They are ready to wreak chaos and death.\"\n\nMacron did not refer specifically to Trump, who occasionally frowned during the speech.\n\nTrump did not respond to Macron publicly. During a speech later Sunday at a World War I-era cemetery, Trump praised the French leader for hosting the event he called \"very beautiful\" and \"well done.\"\n\nIn defending \"America First,\" Trump has often said the United States needs to address its own needs. During a meeting with Macron on Saturday, Trump said other countries need to share the burdens of mutual defense and free trade: \"We want to help Europe, but it has to be fair.\"\n\nBefore the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, the bells at Notre Dame and other cathedrals in Paris and across the continent rang at the exact time the armistice took effect: the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, 100 years ago.\n\nThe event itself ran a little late as Macron and other leaders marched up the Champs-Elysees toward the event site.\n\nTrump arrived separately, not without incident: A topless woman ran toward the presidential motorcade but was quickly caught by police. She had the words \"fake peacemakers\" written on her body.\n\nAnti-Trump demonstrators were arrested throughout the day.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump went to the event separately \"due to security protocols.\"\n\nHolding umbrellas, the president and first lady Melania Trump greeted Macron and other guests, including Putin.\n\nThe Russian president gave Trump a thumbs up and patted him on the upper arm.\n\nDuring the ceremony, a military band played \"La Marseillaise\"; a choir of veterans later sang the French national anthem a capella. Yo-Yo Ma, seated near the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beneath the arc, performed cello solos. The French air force staged a flyover.\n\nOther countries held similar World War I commemorations, from Australia and New Zealand to England and India.\n\nTo safeguard Trump and more than 60 other world leaders in attendance, the Paris event took place amid heavy security.\n\nSaturday night, siren-blaring police vehicles began lining the streets around the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon in 1806 to celebrate his military victories and finished more than a decade after his death in exile.\n\nDomestic politics also occupied Trump's mind.\n\nIn a tweet 20 minutes before the program, Trump attributed the California wildfires to poor supervision of forest lands. \"With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!\" he said.\n\nFor the American president, the program at the Arc de Triomphe began a day of commemorations before he boarded Air Force One to head back to Washington.\n\nAfter a luncheon with other leaders, Trump traveled to a World War I cemetery.\n\nTrump canceled a trip Saturday to another cemetery. The White House cited rainy weather, saying it would have created problems for the helicopters that would have ferried the president.\n\nExcept for tweets about the wildfires in California and election recounts in Florida, Trump has kept a relatively low profile during his weekend in Paris.\n\nDuring a ceremonial dinner Saturday, the Turkish government released a photo of Trump seated next to its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, hours after Erdogan said he had provided the United States and other countries with audiotapes of last month's murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"I can confirm they sat next to one another and they discussed the ongoing tragic situation with Khashoggi,\" Sanders said.\n\nA century ago, many in the USA and Europe recoiled from the mass destruction of World War I, the horrors of trench warfare and gas attacks. The war wiped out monarchies and forged new countries in Europe and the Middle East, but it did not end international rivalries that led to the war.\n\nGermany, angry over war reparations imposed by rivals and eager for revenge, turned to Adolf Hitler. World War II began in 1939.\n\nDuring events over the weekend, Macron said the global community must work together to prevent conflicts.\n\n\"The message, if we want to live up to the sacrifice of those soldiers who said, \u2018Never again!\u2019, is to never yield to our weakest instincts, nor to efforts to divide us,\" Macron told a group of youngsters during a visit Saturday to the Compiegne Forest.\n\nMerkel attended the event at Compiegne, the site where Germany surrendered to France and allies after World War I and where France surrendered to Hitler's Germany at the start of World War II.\n\n\"A century on, as we see nationalist voices again on the rise across the globe,\" tweeted Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former secretary-general of NATO. \"we must keep in mind the price we paid to build the peace and enjoy the freedoms we do today.\"\n\nBeatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said Macron made a good point: \"We're seeing a very concerning trend toward nationalistic, anti-democratic leaders; they are abandoning multilateralism.\"\n\nTrump \"certainly speaks like that,\" she said. \"America First.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/11/macron-world-leaders-rebuke-nationalism-world-war-event-attended-trump/1966474002/", "A free press, even a biased one, is enshrined in the Constitution because it is essential to our liberty.

The New York Times was the newspaper of record with its motto: \u201cAll the news that\u2019s fit to print.\u201d There were only three television networks \u2014 CBS, NBC, and ABC \u2014 and most Americans stopped their day to watch the evening news. And while Republicans and Democrats had deep disagreements on issues and policy, they based their thinking on an understanding of the same basic facts.\n\nToday, most of us get our news from our mobile device, often curated for us by an algorithm created to show only what we like to read or agree with. Often, the content comes without the benefit of an editor, a fact-checker, or a responsible news organization. In some cases, our \u201cnews\u201d may actually be propaganda from a campaign, from a political party, or even from a foreign adversary. Accordingly, our political disagreements may not even be based upon the same \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nThis represents a growing challenge for democracy, dependent as it is upon a citizenry informed by fact and truth. It also underscores the vital role played by professional news organizations. They may be more critical today than ever before.\n\nA free press, a free nation\n\nAmerica is indebted as a democratic nation to the free press for truths it has uncovered, for truth it has disseminated, and for falsehoods it has repudiated. The press uncovered the government\u2019s lies about the war in Vietnam; it exposed Watergate; it opened our eyes to the sexual abuse of children by priests; and, most recently, it shed a light on the sexual assault by numerous men in power. The free press dispelled the false conspiracies about the 9/11 attacks, President Obama\u2019s birth, and Joe McCarthy\u2019s lurking communists. The work of a free press is essential.\n\nMore: I spent two years serving my country with AmeriCorps. In return, Uncle Sam sent me a bill.\n\nReporters turn White House press briefings into performances. That's why I quit.\n\nElection results did not repudiate Trump. They show he has normalized immorality.\n\nA lesson evidenced by the Arab Spring and by the pseudo-democracies of Venezuela, Russia, and China is democracy and freedom cannot be permanently established in the absence of the basic institutions of freedom, perhaps most notably a free press. If a free press is absent, the door to true democracy is quickly closed. This realization now forms an important part of our national foreign policy.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted late last month, \u201cThere is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People...\u201d He was referring to \u201cCNN and others in the Fake News business,\u201d not foreign provocateurs.\n\nSurely every president has endured stories that he knew were inaccurate and has chaffed at one or more news publications. George Washington was routinely brutalized by a newspaper that had been anonymously funded and founded by his own secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson. But no American president has ever before vilified the American press or one of its professional outlets as an \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nThe media is biased \u2014 but still essential\n\nAttacking the media or publications that lean in a different direction than the Republican Party is decidedly good politics. We conservatives have long suffered from the left-leaning attitudes and reporting of the media. But today, if we don\u2019t like one outlet, there are others from which we can \u2014 and do \u2014 choose. And, more importantly, denigrating the media diminishes an institution that is critical to democracy, both here and abroad. As a political tactic, it may be brilliant, but it comes with a large cost to the cause of freedom.\n\nAt one of my recent campaign events I was asked whether I would, \u201ctake action to shut down ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and the New York Times.\u201d When I responded \u201cof course not,\u201d and that, in fact, I would do everything in my power to preserve freedom of speech, the person persisted by arguing that these outlets purvey fake news. I found this deeply disturbing. How different from when I was growing up; no one then would seriously consider stifling the free press for publishing the news and opinion as they saw fit.\n\nMy questioner, however, did raise a valid point: isn\u2019t the media biased? Of course it is. Humans are biased and the media is populated by humans. The founders knew that the media would be biased; because humans are involved, there is no other way. We can and should call for accuracy and responsibility in reporting from every member of the press. But a free press, even if biased, was guaranteed in our Constitution because it is critical to the preservation of the Republic.\n\nI sometimes become irritated by stories I know are wrong, especially when they are about me. But I cannot conceive of thinking or saying that the media or any responsible news organization is an enemy. The media is essential to our Republic, to our freedom, to the cause of freedom abroad, and to our national security. It is very much our friend.\n\nSenator-elect Mitt Romney of Utah is a former Republican presidential nominee and a former governor of Massachusetts.

USA TODAY\n\nPeople say 'thank you for your service' but I think they mean 'thank you for killing for me.' At times I wish they'd have the moral courage to say it.\n\nU.S. Marines in the Afghan province of Hemland on April, 29, 2017. (Photo: Wakil Kohsar)\n\nCivilians who have never experienced the raw savagery of combat will never know what it is like. Some fantasize through what they've seen in films and on television \u2014 I used to do that, too, as a young boy. But it is nothing like that. Nothing glamorous. Nothing spectacular.\n\nEverything it is, and is about, is life-changing to those who have to make that one conscious decision. Looking through the scope at a nameless enemy who is determined to kill you, and having squeezed the trigger of their rifle. There is a short \"pop\" in the shoulder for the shooter \u2014 but the recoil lasts longer than many will ever imagine.\n\nThis Veterans Day, thousands know this reality all too well. There are more who don't. Most have no idea what to say to veterans. Most even stumble when sputtering out, \"Thank you for your service.\" Even though I think they subconsciously want to say, \"Thank you for killing for me.\"\n\nMost Americans want to be insulated from ugliness of war\n\nThere is no way to dance around the grim facets of war. In war, killing is what happens. To soldiers and Marines. To civilians who get caught in the crossfire and to the enemy who makes their own decisions to fight. In the end, it is a brutal and thrilling experience all wrapped together that has to be processed the rest of one's life.\n\nNo one has ever come up to me and said, \"Thank you for killing for me.\u201d Although there are times now, I wish more would have the moral courage to say it to my face. To admit to themselves, that as fellow Americans, this is really what they expect from the warriors who protect their nation. Their freedom.\n\nCivilians, even the ones who vote for it, have always tried to find a way to separate themselves from the harsh realities of war. Insulated. We have become a country that is so disconnected to war, we act as if it is not even happening around us \u2014 yet in fact, it is. We have been a nation at war for the past 17 years.\n\nMore: Vote, and think of this Utah mayor and Army major who just died in Afghanistan\n\n17 years after 9/11, Afghanistan remains the war we can't win but can't afford to lose\n\nVeterans sacrificed enough: USA TODAY investigations of VA health care help our heroes\n\nSo why do so many Americans fumble when it comes to articulating what they want to say to veterans? Isn't it enough to just say, \"Thank you for your service\"? Or do they honestly want to get more connected to veterans and ask them the more profound questions? I would say in my experience that they don't. Keeping the ugliness of war tucked away in the minds of the veterans is more comfortable for most.\n\nWhat I suppose most supporters really want to say is, \"Thank you for serving, I know what you went through must have been tough, and I want you to know that I\u2019m grateful for everything you have been through. How much you've sacrificed. How much courage that must have taken at such a young age \u2014 I could have never done what you have.\" But that doesn\u2019t roll quite as easily off the tongue while pumping your gas, I don't suppose.\n\nIt doesn't include the small percentage of daft Americans who blurt out, \"Thanks for your service, so, how many people have you killed?\" They are far and few between, although out there. Their statements of ignorance only serve to embarrass veterans, and themselves. Anyone who answers that type of question most likely has never even been in combat. Poseurs.\n\nCivilians are a part of war, too\n\nIt's not about getting credit for carrying out the worst aspects of our jobs as professional soldiers or having some insignificant, 60-second therapy session to unload on total strangers. It is all about understanding what we ask of our young men and women to do when we send them off to war \u2014 and that no matter how detached you think you may be from it, ultimately you voted for it, or had an opinion about it one way or the other. You're part of it.\n\nOur culture rarely wants to talk about death or killing unless it's bolstered by some flowery parade with people waving flags. Or on days when the smell of hot dogs and charred hamburgers fills the air as small groups celebrate their day off at the expense of those who\u2019ve served. How many readers have actually had a barbecue and served a sizzling burger to a combat veteran? Served any veteran for that matter?\n\nThis isn't \"guilt patriotism\" \u2014 this is the reality. The reality of the separation in our nation between those who\u2019ve served and those who think they are \"supporting the troops.\" It's not just a bumper sticker on your car.

It means so much more to do it here, too.\"\n\nTwo programs that appear to be moving in opposite directions kept going their separate ways while Cal beat USC (5-5, 4-4) for the first time since its famed 34-31, triple-overtime victory over the vaunted Trojans in Berkeley in 2003.\n\nThe Trojans hadn't lost to the Bears at the Coliseum since 2000, coach Paul Hackett's final season at USC before Pete Carroll took over.\n\n\"The streak and all that, we don't really talk about it,\" said Cal coach Justin Wilcox, the former USC defensive coordinator. \"I didn't even know about it until somebody brought it up this week. We're not playing the streak. These guys are competing and playing for each other.\"\n\nCal did all of its scoring in an eight-minute span of the third quarter, starting with a safety when a shotgun snap by USC's Toa Lobendahn went 22 yards backward into the end zone. Garbers threw a 29-yard TD pass on the ensuing offensive drive, and he rushed for another score 6 \u00bd minutes later after Traveon Beck's interception.\n\nJ.T. Daniels passed for 180 yards and threw two TD passes to Tyler Vaughns, but the Trojans were shut out in the second half of their third loss in four games.\n\nUSC gained just 40 yards after halftime against Cal's sturdy defense while losing at the Coliseum for the second straight game after a 19-game home winning streak through the entire tenure of coach Clay Helton.\n\n\"I'm not going to get overemotional and say the ship is sinking,\" Helton said when asked about the state of his program after three losses in four games and its first five-loss regular season since 2012. \"For us right now, we're making too many mistakes across the board. I'm sorry for the 5-5 season, but better days are here to come. ... I believe in our kids. I believe in their ability.\"\n\nBoth defenses were solid early on a chilly night at the Coliseum, but the Trojans appeared to be in good shape for yet another win over their upstate rivals despite failing on a fake field goal in the first quarter.\n\nA few minutes after Vaughns caught a 2-yard TD pass in the second quarter, Ajene Harris stripped Garbers following a 23-yard run. Daniels then hit Vaughns for a 23-yard score.\n\nUSC could have had more, but Cal's Luc Bequette stripped the ball from St. Brown at the Cal 10 in the final minute before halftime.\n\nAfter managing only 69 yards of offense in the first half, the Bears quickly got back in it. After Cal got a safety on that horrific shotgun snap, Garbers promptly threw a 29-yard TD pass down the middle to an unguarded Wharton, who somehow hadn't scored in 10 games as a starting wideout despite leading the Bears in yards receiving.\n\nGarbers had only 30 yards passing all night before that 29-yard scoring throw.\n\nDaniels then threw his first interception to Traveon Beck, and Garbers mounted Cal's go-ahead drive culminating in his 5-yard TD run. Garbers celebrated by raising the Trojans' famed V for Victory gesture \u2014 and then turning the \"V'' downward.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nCalifornia: Despite another mediocre offensive game, coach Justin Wilcox has more tangible proof of progress in his second year with this gutsy win in a tough venue. The Bears will go bowling, and they're riding momentum into the Big Game with Stanford next week.\n\nUSC: Helton's second game as the Trojans' play-caller was good in stretches, but not nearly good enough. His seat is even hotter now, and it'll be scorching if the Trojans don't beat UCLA to secure bowl eligibility next week before No. 3 Notre Dame visits after Thanksgiving.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCalifornia: Host Stanford in the 121st Big Game on Nov. 17.\n\nUSC: At UCLA in the annual crosstown showdown on Nov. 17.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nSNL\u2019s Pete Davidson Apologizes to Rep.-Elect Dan Crenshaw after mocking the veteran's combat wound in a previous episode. (Photo: SNL)\n\nA week after coming under fire for his controversial joke about Texas congressman-elect Dan Crenshaw on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Pete Davidson apologized directly to the former Navy SEAL.\n\nDuring an election-themed segment of \"Weekend Update\" last week, Davidson stopped by to give his \"first impressions\" of candidates such as Crenshaw, whom he compared to \"a hitman in a porno movie. I\u2019m sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever.\"\n\n\"I mean this from the bottom of my heart: I made a poor choice of words,\" Davidson said Saturday night, in his return to the \"Weekend Update\" desk. \"He is a war hero and deserves all the respect in the world. And if any good came of it, it's that for one day, the left and right finally came together to agree on something: that I'm a (jerk).\"\n\n\"Ya think?\" said Crenshaw as he walked out for a surprise appearance, earning cheers from the \"SNL\" studio audience. \"Thanks for making a Republican look good.\"\n\nCrenshaw, who lost his right eye to an IED blast in Afghanistan during his third deployment in 2012, continued by telling Davidson \"we're good\" and \"apology accepted.\" Jokingly, the congressman then refused to answer his phone when Ariana Grande's \"Breathin\" started playing as his ringtone. (Davidson and the pop star broke off their engagement last month.)\n\nHe then took a good-natured swipe at Davidson with his own \"first impressions\" of the comedian's pictures.\n\n\"Pete looks like if the meth from 'Breaking Bad' was a person,\" Crenshaw said. \"Pete looks like a troll doll with a tapeworm. ... Pete looks like Martin Short in 'The Santa Clause 3.' By the way, one of these three is actually good on 'SNL.' \"\n\nCrenshaw ended his stint with a message of unity, saying \"there's a lot to learn here.\"\n\n\"Not just that the left and right can still agree on some things, but also, Americans can forgive one another,\" Crenshaw said. \"We can remember what brings us together as a country and still see the good in each other.\"\n\nWith Veteran's Day on Monday, Crenshaw then encouraged people to say \"never forget\" to veterans, in lieu of \"thank you for your service.\"\n\n\"When you say 'never forget' to a veteran, you're implying that as an American, you are in it with them,\" Crenshaw said. \"Not separated by some imaginary barrier between civilians and veterans, but connected together as grateful, fellow Americans. We'll never forget the sacrifices made by veterans past and present, and never forget those we lost on 9/11 \u2014 heroes like Pete's father,\" Scott Davidson, a New York firefighter who died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\"So I'll just say, Pete, never forget,\" Crenshaw concluded, as the two shook hands.\n\nOn Monday morning, Crenshaw recapped his stint on \"SNL\" during an appearance on \"Today,\" saying that going on the show \"felt like the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"I would appreciate it if everybody would stop looking for reasons to be offended, and that\u2019s what this was all about,\" he said.\n\nCrenshaw described how \"SNL\" boss Lorne Michaels called him to ask him to come on the show. Crenshaw was initially unsure whether he could fit \"SNL\" in his busy Veterans Day schedule.\n\n\"We were hesitant at first, we weren't sure what the schedule was going to look like. We had a lot of veterans' events planned this weekend, of course,\" he said. \"But in the end we decided to do it because what better platform to give a united platform for the country, talk about forgiveness and talk about veterans? And they let me do that last part, and we got a little serious and I was able to give the message about what I think it means to connect with veterans and how to bridge that gap between civilians and military.\"\n\nAs for his Davidson roasts, \"It was a collaboration,\" Crenshaw said.\n\n\"(The writers) come up with the framework, and I had a bunch of ideas. It's not all that often that I get to pitch a bunch of comedy ideas to one of the biggest shows in the world, so the good idea fairy was all over the place.\"\n\n\u201cWe decided to do it \u2026 because what better platform than to sort of give a united message for the country.\u201d-Dan Crenshaw joins TODAY after his appearance on SNL pic.twitter.com/XWoDzRgFCd \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) November 12, 2018\n\n\u201cIt felt like the right thing to do.

Hamonic got his second goal, with Garnet Hathaway setting a screen that kept Campbell from seeing the shot to the far post. Austin Czarnik and Noah Hanifin had assists, with Hanifin picking up his third in the past four games.\n\n\"I mean, I don't score much, so it was nice. A bonus,\" Hamonic said. \"Glad to help the team out that way, but I thought defensively our group collectively was really good.\"\n\nHamonic also played his part to help smother the Kings' floundering offense. He used his body to break up a pass by Ilya Kovalchuk during an odd-man rush in the second period, when the Kings managed four shots on goal.\n\nHamonic also disrupted a breakaway by Tanner Pearson on the power play in the third period, coming up from behind to delay Pearson from shooting and allowing Rittich to make the save when Pearson did put the puck on goal.\n\n\"I think he was the most noticeable guy either way on either team,\" Flames coach Bill Peters said of Hamonic. \"He just found a way to be involved in the game.\"\n\nThe Kings struggled to create chances on a consistent basis, continuing a recurring theme this season. Even when Jeff Carter won an offensive-zone face-off with 44 seconds remaining and Campbell pulled for an extra attacker, the Kings still could not beat Rittich.\n\n\"We're getting some shots, but not the shots we want,\" Kings forward Alex Iafallo said. \"We need to get that passion back, that hunger to get to the soft areas and keep making plays.\"\n\nAfter beating the Anaheim Ducks 4-1 on Tuesday in coach Willie Desjardins' debut with the team, the Kings have lost two straight and scored one goal each in defeats against the Minnesota Wild and Flames.\n\nDesjardins said the Kings would have to be more aggressive on offense, even if it meant getting away from the sound defensive structure that has been the team's identity this decade.\n\n\"I think that's the way they have always won, so I think some of the top guys think a little bit more defensively,\" Desjardins said. \"The guys on the other side, (Flames forward Johnny) Gaudreau, (Sean) Monahan, they are always thinking offense. Saying that, I think we have to create some systems that are going to get guys more involved. We got to force ourselves to get up ice and play more aggressive and play more offensive.\"\n\nNOTES: The Kings are 1-8-1 when allowing the first goal this season. ...

Week 11 in college football answers these questions and much more. USA TODAY\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs running back D'Andre Swift celebrates a touchdown against the Auburn Tigers during the second half at Sanford Stadium. (Photo: Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nATHENS, Ga. \u2014 The Georgia Bulldogs are about to have a lot of fans, certainly more than they ever knew. Though it will be strictly a marriage of convenience, the legion of new red-and-black backers is going to reach all the way north to Michigan, west to Indiana and of course 45 minutes up Interstate 85 from here across the state line to South Carolina.\n\nBecause make no mistake, there is dread if not outright resignation about what lies ahead for college football over the next eight weeks. As tired as the country may be of Alabama, never has a championship team felt as inevitable as this one. Even the manufactured drama feels cheaply made.\n\nAnd so the rest of college football is down to one more chance to squeeze Alabama out of the College Football Playoff, and it will come on Dec. 1 when Georgia gets its shot in the SEC championship game.\n\nMore: Tua Tagovailoa leaves with injured leg in Alabama's defeat of Mississippi State\n\nCollege football's winners and losers: Ohio State keeps playoff hopes alive in Week 11\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely narrow path, of course. And even if Nick Saban instructed his players to literally lay down on the field for 60 minutes at Atlanta\u2019s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the Crimson Tide might make it in anyway; such is the regard the playoff selection committee seems to have for all things Alabama.\n\nBut in Georgia\u2019s 27-10 win over Auburn here on Saturday, there was at least a glimmer of potential resistance and a reason for fans of schools like Clemson, Michigan and Notre Dame to hope the Bulldogs can do their dirty work.\n\nGeorgia is still not as good as last season, when it had the national championship ripped away by Tua Tagovailoa. But if Georgia improves in the next three weeks as much as it improved over the last three, it will be Alabama\u2019s toughest test by far \u2014 and maybe even more than that.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t played perfect,\u201d Bulldogs coach Kirby Smart said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t always played smart. But we\u2019ve played hard.\u201d\n\nThough its 9-1 record and No. 5 ranking would suggest otherwise, Georgia has spent most of this season trying to figure out what it does really well with a group of players that is fundamentally different from what it brought to the playoff last season.\n\nThat team was built around a grown-up defensive line and a linebacker in Roquan Smith who flat-out erased mistakes; this one has had an inconsistent pass rush but a cornerback in Deandre Baker who can shut down half the field.\n\nThat team was about two NFL running backs and a freshman quarterback who didn\u2019t make mistakes; this one moves it up and down the field and seems to stall in the red zone or turn it over.\n\nBut with two games left in the regular season, Georgia looks enough like a championship team to suggest that it can become one in a few weeks.\n\nMore: No. 6 Oklahoma survives Oklahoma State with stop on late two-point conversion\n\nMore: Epic Michigan State meltdown ends chance for upset of No. 7 Ohio State\n\nPart of that difference rests simply with D\u2019Andre Swift no longer being bothered by the groin injury that hampered him early on. Swift, who was on Heisman lists in the preseason, had 186 yards on 17 carries against Auburn and was running away from Auburn defenders on the 77-yard touchdown with 13:53 remaining that put a hammer lock on this game.\n\nSwift\u2019s speed, ability to cut and his low center of gravity make him the kind of unique, game-breaking player you need against Alabama in a game where it will be difficult to grind out lots of long drives. If he can hit one or two big gains in the SEC championship game, it transforms Georgia\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cEvery time he makes a play, everyone gets hyped,\u201d said receiver Mecole Hardman. \u201cWe haven\u2019t reached our potential yet. We have to keep going, keep chopping.\u201d\n\nThough Georgia is flawed \u2014 a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d Smart said \u2014 consider this: In a three-week stretch, the Bulldogs had to beat two rivals and win an emotional road game at Kentucky where the SEC East title was on the line. They did it by margins of 19, 17 and 17 points.\n\nIn other words, while everyone wanted to downgrade Georgia\u2019s chances of making the playoff again after getting hammered at LSU on Oct. 13, the trajectory is starting to look more like a young team that is arriving right on time.\n\n\u201cWere not thinking about it,\u201d Hardman said. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about their next two opponents. We\u2019re worried about our next two opponents. We just beat Auburn so we\u2019re just going to celebrate this one. Dec 1, that\u2019s in the future.\u201d\n\nAnd by then, maybe the Bulldogs will turn around those red zone issues that forced them to settle for a pair of field goals early Saturday into touchdowns. Maybe offensive guard Ben Cleveland, who\u2019s slowly working his way back to health after a left fibula fracture in September, will be full speed. Maybe that pass rush, which started to come alive a little bit as Georgia held Auburn to 3-of-11 on third down, will get to Tagovailoa and force a few mistakes.\n\nThat\u2019s at least what the country can hope for on Dec. 1 if the goal is to hand Alabama a loss that would push the Crimson Tide to fifth behind Clemson, Notre Dame, Georgia and Michigan.\n\nIt may be the only chance for someone else to hold the trophy.", "Oregon State head coach Jonathan Smith looks at the scoreboard during a timeout against Stanford in the second half during an NCAA college football game on Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Stanford, Calif.

It's what we do in practice every day.\"\n\nBryce Love scored a touchdown and rushed for 90 yards, his most since gaining 136 against Southern California on Sept. 8. Cameron Scarlett also scored for the Cardinal (6-4, 4-3 Pac-12) with a career-long run of 41 yards. Dorian Maddox scored on a 1-yard run, his first career touchdown.\n\nJake Luton passed for 205 yards and touchdowns of 63 yards to Trevon Bradford and 7 yards to Noah Togiai. Jermar Jefferson rushed for 109 yards for Oregon State (2-8, 1-6). Bradford finished with five receptions for 120 yards.\n\nLast year the teams combined for 486 total yards in Stanford's 15-14 win. The teams had 632 by halftime on Saturday.\n\nCostello threw for 342 yards and touchdown passes of 28, 9, 75 and 5 yards. He's thrown four touchdowns in three games this season, the most since Andrew Luck did in 2011. Parkinson finished with six catches and 166 yards.\n\n\"K.J. played extremely well,\" Stanford coach David Shaw said. \"Him and Colby have been working at timing. It was great to see those two connect.\"\n\nParkinson became integral to Stanford's offense after top receiver JJ Arcega-Whiteside suffered an injury in the first quarter of last week's loss at Washington.\n\n\"I was joking with him before the game that I'd catch a touchdown pass for him,\" Parkinson said.\n\nJordan Choukair kicked a 40-yard field goal for the Beavers on the final play of the first half.\n\nLove, who did not play after a brief appearance in the third quarter, finished off a 5-play, 75-yard drive with a 28-yard run that brought comparisons from last year when he set a school rushing record and was the Heisman Trophy runner-up.\n\n\"He had some good plays. He's a good player,\" Oregon State coach Jonathan Smith said. \"He's a tough kid. They're throwing the ball more than they have but they can still run the ball.\"\n\nThe Cardinal broke it open in the second quarter, scoring the first three touchdowns, all passes to Parkinson, and taking a 34-7 advantage before the Beavers closed within 34-17 by halftime.\n\nAIR QUALITY\n\nThe game was played with an air quality index close to 150 through the night, on the low end of the 'dangerous' level, due to smoke from the Camp Fire in Butte County. Smoke was visible throughout the contest. \"It's been a rough week,\" Shaw said. \"All our thoughts and prayers go to them. But I was happy to play the game at its proper time.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nStanford became bowl eligible with two road games remaining at Cal and at UCLA. The Cardinal had higher expectations entering the season but at least continue their school record streak of 10 consecutive years in a bowl game. \"It's a bar but a low bar,\" Shaw said. \"We take pride in becoming bowl eligible but the thing is to win as many games as possible and they'll tell us what bowl game to go to.\"\n\nOregon State freshman Jermar Jefferson entered the game ranked sixth in country in rushing and continues to move up the Beavers' all-time single-season rushing list. He recorded his sixth career 100-yard rushing game, second only Jacquizz Rodgers (with seven) among Oregon State freshmen. Jefferson is the only freshman in the country with more than 800 yards.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nStanford plays at California in the annual Big Game on Saturday.\n\nOregon State travels to Washington on Saturday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Brad Tollefson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) \u2014 Sam Ehlinger had gotten No. 15 Texas down the field with some nifty runs. The sophomore quarterback then took a shot at the end zone \u2014 and got the winning pass.\n\nLil'Jordan Humphrey outleaped a defender inside the 5 and then pulled him along to the end zone for a 29-yard touchdown with 21 seconds left, giving the Longhorns a 41-34 victory over Texas Tech after blowing a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I have so much confidence in him,\" Ehlinger said.\n\n\"He's as good a jump ball guy as there is in the country. We're already in field goal range,\" Longhorns coach Tom Herman said. \"If we get one-on-one coverage, we're going to try for the win.\"\n\nWith Ehlinger's fourth TD pass, and second to Humphrey, the Longhorns (7-3, 5-2 Big 12) snapped a two-game skid that had cost them the Big 12 lead. They stayed a game behind co-leaders No. 6 Oklahoma and No. 7 West Virginia with two games left to determine who plays in the conference championship game Dec. 1.\n\nNext up for the Longhorns is No. 23 Iowa State, the team they are tied with for third place.\n\n\"To battle back like we did, after a heartbreaking loss on a two-point conversion, will certainly pay dividends in the overall confidence of this team,\" Herman said, referring to the 42-41 home loss a week earlier when Mountaineers quarterback Will Grier ran for the 2-pointer in the final minute.\n\nTexas went 75 yards in seven plays for the winning score at Texas Tech (5-5, 3-4), whose 17 consecutive points in just over 5 1/2 minutes included recovering an onside kick. The Red Raiders tied the game on Jett Duffey's fourth TD pass, a 9-yarder to Antoine Wesley with 1:45 left.\n\nEhlinger started the final drive with runs of 3 and 18 yards, then had a couple of short completions before a 12-yard run that set up his game-winning pass to Humphrey, who finished with eight catches for 159 yards. Devin Duvernay also caught two TDs while Ehlinger completed 22 of 34 passes for 312 yards.\n\n\"Let one go that we feel like we shouldn't let go,\" said T.J. Vasher, who had two TD catches for Tech. \"Texas played a pretty good game but we're never OK with a loss. So everybody's pretty upset right now.\"\n\nWesley had eight catches for 171 yards and two touchdowns for the Red Raiders, who lost their third game in a row.\n\nDuffey had 524 total yards in his second start in place of injured Alan Bowman, completing 37 of 47 passes for 444 yards and running 17 times for 80 yards. But he also had three crucial turnovers before the late comeback, throwing a pick near the end zone and fumbling twice on runs that ended inside the Texas 20.\n\n\"It would have been easy to fold after that last fumble, but he competes his tail off,\" coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \"He had a great look in his eye the entire time. ... He gave us a chance to win with his mental toughness there at the end and the way he competed.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTexas: The Longhorns were coming off consecutive losses by a combined four points. Their last four wins haven't been overwhelming \u2014 by a combined 21 points, with the win at Tech the largest margin in that span.\n\nTexas Tech: The Red Raiders missed a chance for consecutive wins over Texas for the first time in 20 years. As much as the win in the regular-season finale in Austin last year likely saved Kingsbury's job, and got them bowl eligible, this loss could cast doubt on his future again. The former Red Raiders quarterback is now 35-38 in his six seasons as coach, and they still need one more win to get to their 16th bowl since 2000.\n\nEHLINGER'S RECORD STREAK\n\nEhlinger broke the Big 12 record for most consecutive passes without an interception. The sophomore extended his streak of passes without a pick to 280, breaking the mark of 273 set by former West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith.\n\nSTUFFED ON 4th DOWN\n\nWhen the Red Raiders tried to convert fourth-and-1 from their own 34 before halftime, Duffey was immediately stuffed and Texas needed only four plays before Keaontay Ingram's 2-yard TD run to go up 17-7.\n\nBOWMAN SITS OUT\n\nBowman had another four-night hospital stay after taking a hit in last week's 51-46 loss to Oklahoma, leading to a recurrence of a partially collapsed lung the standout true freshman initially suffered earlier this season. He was on the sideline before the game, but not in uniform.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTexas is home Saturday night to play Iowa State, which has a five-game Big 12 winning streak.\n\nTexas Tech plays at Kansas State next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nA candle is placed on a tombstone in a field of graves belonging to World War I soldiers in Frankfurt, Germany. World leaders will gather November 11 to mark the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended what was billed as \"the war to end all war.'' (Photo: Michael Probst, AP)\n\nH.G. Wells is famous for having predicted air and space travel, the atomic bomb and the tank, satellite television and something like the internet. He is infamous for another claim: World War I would be \u201cthe war to end all war.\"\n\nThe British science fiction writer made that prediction in 1914, at the beginning of the war. The four years of carnage that ensued and the subsequent failure to secure a lasting peace \u2013 World War II broke out 20 years later \u2013 made his catchphrase synonymous with naive optimism and his prophecy as false as time travel.\n\nBut on the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended the war (at 11 a.m. Nov. 11, 1918 \u2013 the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month) Wells\u2019 optimism looks prescient after all.\n\nAlthough World War I was not the war to end all wars, it was the beginning of the end of a certain kind of war. In the past 70 years, war as Wells knew it \u2013 between nations \u2013 has declined.\n\nTo anyone following news from Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq or Afghanistan (where the United States fights its longest war), that might seem preposterous.\n\nBut partly because of ideas and institutions inspired by World War I, state-vs.-state, cross-border warfare has faded. Despite civil war and rebellion, terrorism and cyberwarfare, our time is more peaceful than its predecessors.\n\nWill it remain so? President Donald Trump, who went to France to commemorate the armistice\u2019s centennial, has been more critical than any other president since World War II of the security and trade policies that did not end armed conflict but promoted what's known as the Long Peace.\n\nWar then and now\n\nForget what you learned in school. \u201cWorld War I did start a process that has made the world safer,\" says Scott Shapiro, a Yale University expert on attempts to outlaw war. Steven Pinker, a Harvard polymath who\u2019s studied global violence, calls the war \u201ca watershed in the transition to a more peaceful world.\"\n\nThe war discredited several assumptions widely held in 1914.\n\nWar was romantic and glorious.\n\nThere was no romance and little glory on the Western Front, just vast, indiscriminate, constant death. The war decimated the elite classes that had nurtured lofty ideas about wars. The third marquess of Salisbury, Queen\u2019s Victoria\u2019s last prime minister, had 10 grandsons. Five perished at the front.\n\nWar invigorated society and \"cleansed\" it of decadent values and bad habits.\n\nThis notion was particularly popular in Britain. Arthur Conan Doyle, who enlisted in the government propaganda campaign, had Sherlock Holmes tell Dr. Watson that the war \u201cwill be cold and bitter \u2026 and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it\u2019s God\u2019s own wind none the less, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared.\u2019\u2019\n\nInstead, the war left even its European victors, Britain and France, weaker and more divided. It soured its strongest survivor, the United States, on a level of international engagement that might have kept the peace.\n\nWar solved conflicts between nations.\n\nTo the contrary, the war led to the overthrow of half its combatants' governments \u2013 Czarist Russia, Imperial Germany and the Ottoman Turkish and Austro-Hungarian empires. It worsened enmity between France and Germany.\n\nA war in two acts\n\nIf the idea that World War I lived up to Wells\u2019 audacious promise still seems bizarre, look at the two world wars as many historians do \u2013 part of a single conflict.\n\nAfter this long war ended in 1945, its traumas were not forgotten. The victors established institutions (such as the United Nations), treaties (NATO) and aid programs (the Marshall Plan) based on ideas that dated to the end of World War I.\n\nThanks to these initiatives, and the fear of nuclear weapons, since 1945, there has been no major war between major powers; even the biggest conflicts, such as Korea and Vietnam, have been limited in scope; the amount of sovereign territory that has changed hands \u2013 once war\u2019s raison d\u2019etre \u2013 has been small.\n\nExceptions prove the rule. From 1980 to 1988, Iran and Iraq fought an old-school war, complete with trenches. In 2014, Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. Neither war set a happy precedent. Iraq-Iran was a bloody draw, and Russia suffered from economic sanctions.\n\nThe world still has plenty of armed conflict. But war, says Rachel Kleinfeld of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201chas metamorphosed into something else\" \u2013 more typically within nations than between them. In 1958, the number of internal conflicts \u2013 usually civil wars \u2013 passed the number of external ones for the first time since World War I.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s most dangerous places aren\u2019t even at war, Kleinfeld notes. In 2015, for instance, there were more violent deaths in Brazil than Syria.\n\nNews vs. numbers\n\nWhy does an end to war, or even a more peaceful world, strike people as ludicrous?\n\nPinker says it\u2019s because we follow the news instead of counting the numbers.\n\nThe decline in international warfare is quantifiable. In 2016, there were 49 active conflicts in the world that caused 25 or more battle-related deaths. Only two \u2013 border clashes between India and Pakistan and Ethiopia and Eritrea \u2013 were between sovereign states.\n\nPublic opinion is formed by news reports that focus on the unusual and the violent; if it bleeds, it leads.\n\nHence, an irony: In World War I, censorship of casualty figures made those on the home front think the world was less violent than it was; today, free movement of news makes us think the world is more violent than it is.\n\nThe pacifist who cried 'War!'\n\nIn 1914, H.G. Wells, author of \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"The Time Machine,\" was a prominent internationalist and peace advocate. But he'd become convinced that the key to peace was war against militaristic, imperialistic Germany.\n\n\u201cThis, the greatest of all wars, is not just another war,\" Wells argued. \u201cIt is the last war.\"\n\n\u201cThis is now a war for peace,\" he wrote in \"The War that Will End War.\" \u201cIt aims straight at disarmament. It aims at a settlement that shall stop this sort of thing forever. Every soldier who fights against Germany now is a crusader against war.\"\n\nLike most, he expected decisive battles and a short war. Instead, the armies got bogged down in a network of trenches that stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea. Repeated frontal charges produced minuscule advances and staggering casualties.\n\nThe slaughter made Wells\u2019 promise even more important \u2013 for only the highest of causes could justify such suffering.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, who'd campaigned for president in 1916 opposing U.S. entry into World War I, led his nation into the war in 1917. He said it would \"make the world safe for democracy.'' And he was associated with the claim that the conflict was \"a war to end all war.'' (Photo: Courtesy of Library of Congress)\n\nThe United States entered the war in 1917, largely because of German submarine attacks on neutral shipping. President Woodrow Wilson, who\u2019d pledged to keep the nation at peace, took a cue from Wells: The war would \u201cmake the world safe for democracy.\"\n\nIt ended in 1918 with a de facto surrender by Germany and its exhausted allies. During the war, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George privately mocked Wells, reputedly saying, \"This war, like the next war, is a war to end war.\" But on Nov. 11, he rose in Parliament and said, \u201cThis, the greatest of all wars, is not just another war. It is the last war.\"\n\nThe Allied powers gathered in France to draw up a peace treaty. The victors, especially the French, demanded terms that seemed outrageously harsh to Germans. Adolf Hitler would use that resentment to seize power in the 1930s.\n\nIn the USA, the idealism of 1917 was replaced by disillusionment with European politics and fear of entangling alliances. The U.S. Senate rejected membership in the newly formed League of Nations, the world body fiercely promoted by Wells.\n\nThe peace treaty was signed in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Some called it \u201cthe peace to end peace.\"\n\nThere were attempts to redeem the Great War. In 1926, the major naval powers agreed to reduce the number of warships. Two years later, most nations signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which outlawed war to settle international disputes.\n\nBut war was not through with the world. In 1935, Italy invaded and conquered Ethiopia. In 1937, Japan invaded China. In 1939, Germany touched off another world war when it capped years of aggression by invading Poland.\n\nPeople in 1918 thought nothing could be worse than a war that killed 9 million combatants. This one would kill 15 million. Wells\u2019 dream was as dead as the 20,000 Britons lost on the first morning of the Battle of the Somme.\n\nA day to remember\n\nIn 1954, the 11th of November, known for 35 years as Armistice Day, was renamed Veterans Day in the USA. It was part of the slow process of forgetting the war to end all war.\n\nBut the day was never forgotten by Franklin Roosevelt, who in 1918 was assistant secretary of the Navy; nor by Harry Truman, an artillery officer in France; nor by George Marshall, a staff officer for the U.S. commanding general, John Pershing; nor by Dean Acheson, a naval officer.\n\nIn the 1940s, these men clutched the lessons of World War I as they created the institutions and forged the alliances that helped produce the Long Peace. They never spoke of anything so grand as the end of war.\n\nWells lived to see the start of World War II. This time, he issued a small book called \"The Rights of Man; Or What Are We Fighting For?\" in which he argued for a declaration of human rights as a key war aim.\n\nIn 1948, two years after his death, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Wells would have been pleased. He\u2019d suggested his own epitaph: \u201cI told you so. You damned fools.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/11/world-war-100th-anniversary-armistice-trump-france/1766101002/", "BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 At the site of Dabo Swinney's first victory as the head coach of Clemson 10 years ago, the Tigers earned a milestone victory that shows what a superpower they have become.\n\nTrevor Lawrence threw a touchdown pass and ran for a score and No. 2 Clemson knocked Boston College quarterback Anthony Brown out of the game early on the way to routing the 17th-ranked Eagles 27-7 on Saturday night.\n\nThe battle for first-place in the ACC Atlantic Division was not much of a fight. The Tigers (10-0, 7-0, No. 2 CFP) wrapped up a record fourth straight trip to the Atlantic Coast Conference title game as division champions and kept rolling toward another College Football Playoff appearance.\n\n\"This group has kind of made history all year,\" said Swinney, who was a little known receivers coach when he was promoted to head coach by Clemson in 2008, and won his first game Nov. 1 in Chestnut Hill.\n\nNow Clemson is among college football's elite. The current senior class has won 50 games, gone 23-1 in division play and 19-1 on the road.\n\nBoston College (7-3, 4-2, No. 17 CFP) lost Brown on its first possession when the sophomore got off a third-and-9 pass, but was thrown to the turf by star senior defensive tackle Christian Wilkins. Athletic trainers attended to Brown on the field and he walked to the sideline on his own. He wasn't there long before heading to the locker room. In the second quarter, it was announced he would not return.\n\nAfter the game BC coach Steve Addazio said Brown was hospitalized with an internal injury, but would not give specifics.\n\nWithout Brown, BC never threated Clemson's defense. But the Tigers let the Eagles hang around. BC's Michael Walker returned a punt 74 yards for a touchdown and Clemson stalled a couple times in the red zone. With 260 yards of offense, Clemson led only 13-7 at half.\n\nIt took six plays from scrimmage into the second half for the Tigers to build some cushion. Lawrence walked in for a 6-yard TD.\n\nBC backup quarterback EJ Perry was overmatched against one of the best defenses in the country. The sophomore is a better runner than passer, and Wilkins, Austin Bryant and Tanner Muse feasted against a limited attack. Clemson held BC star tailback AJ Dillon to 39 yards on 16 carries.\n\nThe Eagles managed 113 total yards and nine first downs.\n\n\"This is a tough game to break into,\" Addazio said. \"End of the fourth quarter, it's 20-7 without our starting quarterback. You certainly don't want to play the likes of Clemson and lose your quarterback at the start of the game.\"\n\nLawrence was 29 for 40 for 295 yards, including a 2-yard TD pass in the first quarter to Milan Richard out of the Fridge Formation. With 350-pound defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence at fullback and the 315-pound Wilkins at tailback, Trevor Lawrence faked to Wilkins and flipped to Richard on fourth down to put Clemson up 10-7.\n\n\"I'm a threat,\" said Wilkins, who is from nearby Framingham, Massachusetts. \"I'm in the scouting report.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nClemson: The one nit to pick was the Tigers never got their running game really cranked up, but a 58-yard punt return touchdown by Amari Rodgers early in the fourth quarter eliminated any possibility for drama.\n\nBoston College: The Eagles' biggest home game in years featured a sellout crowd of 44,500, sprinkled with Clemson orange, and ESPN's \"College GameDay\" on campus for the first time since 2009. The crowd started building on campus for the pregame show by 5 a.m ., lining the \"Million Dollar Stairs\" that connect the upper campus to the area around Alumni Stadium. The Eagles still have a chance to reach eight victories for the first time since 2009 and nine wins since 2008. But they might have to do it with the No. 2 quarterback.\n\n\"We have all the faith in (Perry),\" BC defensive end Zach Allen said. \"I'm excited for EJ.\"\n\nBAD ANNIVERSARY\n\nOne day short of a year ago, Brown blew out his knee against North Carolina State.\n\nLEATHER HELMET\n\nThe winner of the Clemson-BC games takes home the O'Rourke-McFadden Trophy, named after two stars from the 1940 Cotton Bowl pitting the Eagles and Tigers. Trevor Lawrence earned the black leather helmet that goes to the MVP.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nClemson: The Tigers return home to finish the season against Duke and then South Carolina.\n\n\"We're getting to kind of that championship time.

We got off to a great start.\"\n\nFellow senior Dexter Williams ran for a career-high 202 yards and Notre Dame's defense came up with two first-quarter turnovers by the Seminoles (4-6).\n\nKelly admitted it would be tough not to go back to Book, who leads the nation in completion percentage (74.5) and is sixth in passing efficiency (170.0) while passing for 1,811 and 14 touchdowns since taking over in week four.\n\n\"When the doctor says he's cleared to go,\" Kelly said after being asked when Book would reclaim his starting role. But he didn't want to diminish Wimbush's performance.\n\n\"Brandon wants to win for Notre Dame, for his teammates,\" Kelly said. \"He's been that way whether in a starting role or as a backup. He led our football team when we needed him. It's not an individual game but he had a big hand in it.\"\n\nWith the temperature at 27 degrees \u2014 the third-coldest game at Notre Dame Stadium since the 1980 season \u2014 the Irish wore green jerseys for the fourth time in Kelly's nine-year tenure at Notre Dame to honor their seniors.\n\nWilliams, who sat out the first four games of his senior season because of a university-imposed suspension, piled up the 202 yards on 20 carries, including TD runs of 58 and 32 yards, as Notre Dame outgained Florida State, 495-322, including 365 on the ground.\n\n\"The offensive line came out with the fight,\" Williams said. \"I told them to keep pushing and I'm going to do what I have to do. I just told them to give me a crease and I would make a couple runs for them.\"\n\nWimbush, however, did throw a pair of second-half interceptions that allowed coach Willie Taggart's Seminoles (4-6) to stay around after the Irish had taken a 32-6 halftime lead.\n\n\"We wanted to start fast,\" Taggart said. \"We made mistakes. Against a good football team, you can't do that. We're not stopping the run. It hurts you mentally.\"\n\nCam Akers had two touchdown runs for Florida State, his second on a 7-yard run following Stanford Samuels' interception early in the third quarter.\n\nBut Notre Dame's defense denied points after Dontavious Jackson's third-quarter theft when senior Drue Tranquill and junior Khalid Kareem made stops after the Seminoles had reached the Irish 1. On fourth down, quarterback Deondre Francois (23-47, 216 yards) threw incomplete.\n\nThe Seminoles, who practiced in summer-like conditions in Tallahassee before flying into wintry South Bend, saw Francois' second pass of the game intercepted by senior Nick Coleman and Akers' fumble recovered by junior Daelin Hayes. The Irish converted them into 10 points while taking a 17-0 first-quarter lead.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nFlorida State: The Seminoles were their own worst enemy in the first half, surrendering 10 points after a pair of turnovers in the first quarter and another two points on Julian Love's return of a blocked conversion attempt in the second quarter. FSU's defense, which entered the game allowing just 111.1 yards per game (17th nationally), surrendered 141 yards in the first 30 minutes, 58 on Williams' touchdown run.\n\n\"Mental toughness, discipline and execution,\" Taggart said. \"We didn't execute when we had the chance. On defense, we gave up too many explosive plays.\"\n\n\"You can't spot good teams like that points,\" running back Jacques Patrick said.\n\nNotre Dame: Notre Dame's tall senior receivers dominated the banged-up Florida State secondary with three acrobatic TD catches in the first half. First, the 6-foot-4 Boykin outleaped his defender on a nicely thrown Wimbush pass. Later, the 6-foot-4\u00be Mack kept one foot inbounds to give the Irish a 14-0 lead and then outleaped an FSU defender for a 15-yard TD in the second quarter that sent the Irish in at halftime up 32-6.\n\nDEFENSE SALUTES WIMBUSH\n\nWimbush threw just one touchdown pass and had four interceptions while leading the Irish to a 3-0 start before Kelly and offensive coordinator Chip Long opted to change to Book.\n\n\"If any of you guys know Brandon, he's a high-quality guy,\" defensive end Daelin Hayes said. \"We as a defense wanted to emphasize that we had his back.\"\n\nStanding on the sideline while Book and the offense took off didn't faze Wimbush.\n\n\"It gave me a different perspective,\" he said. \"I was here to support the team however I could.\"\n\nIN THE RUNNING\n\nWith Williams running for a career-high of 202 yards on 20 carries and touchdown runs of 58 and 32, the Irish exploded for a season-high 365. Their previous high was 272 against Stanford.\n\n\"This team has a lot of grit,\" Williams said. \"People have their opinions about us, but we know what we can do and we just have to continue to trust the process each and every game.\"\n\nNotre Dame, which entered the game averaging 181.0 yards rushing (53rd nationally), did not lose yardage on any of its 50 carries and it helped the Irish win the time of possession, 32-28 minutes. Notre Dame was also 9 of 16 on third-down conversions.\n\nWimbush's quick feet accounted for 68 yards on 12 carries, while Jafar Armstrong added 44 on seven rushes and Tony Jones Jr. scooted for 39 on six.\n\nIRISH 4-0 IN GREEN\n\nIt was Senior Night for the Irish, who came out in Kelly (pun intended) Green tops with blue numbers outlined in gold.\n\nIt's the fourth time during Kelly's nine seasons that the team has been in a shade of green. The Irish wore hunter-green jerseys against Army in Yankee Stadium during Kelly's inaugural season in 2010 (and won 27-3); wore all-green uniforms with blue and gold stripes against Boston College at Fenway Park in 2015 (and won 16-13); and wore an olive-green jersey against Army at the Alamodome in 2016 (and won 44-6).\n\nPrior to 1964, Notre Dame often wore green jerseys. Coach Dan Devine's 1977 team, quarterbacked by Joe Montana, came out in green jerseys after wearing blue tops in pregame warmups and then routed USC, 49-19. Notre Dame stayed in green afterward in its march to the national championship that season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlorida State: Saturday at home against No. 17 Boston College.\n\nNotre Dame: Saturday at Yankee Stadium as the home team against No. 13 Syracuse.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

McConnell (12) in overtime of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Memphis, Tenn. (AP Photo/Brandon Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Mike Conley and the Memphis Grizzlies added a bad ending to an emotional day for the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nConley scored a season-high 32 points as the Grizzlies claimed a 112-106 overtime victory over the Sixers, who were short-handed and emotionally spent Saturday night after news broke earlier in the day that the team will trade starters Robert Covington and Dario Saric along with reserve Jerryd Bayless to Minnesota for All-Star Jimmy Butler.\n\n\"It's kind of that feeling in your stomach of just like, I mean, you can't really explain it. I was in disbelief,\" said guard T.J. McConnell who had 16 points and seven assists.\n\nMcConnell's eight points in the fourth quarter helped Philadelphia hold a lead before the Sixers went to overtime for the second night in a row.\n\nDespite the Sixers being short-handed with none of the potentially traded players dressed for the game, it took a strong effort by Conley after halftime for Memphis to remain undefeated at home through five games at FedExForum.\n\nConley, who entered the game shooting 32 percent from the field in the last five games, converted 12 of 24 shots in the game. That included scoring 13 points in the third quarter, making 6 of 8 shots to help Memphis erase a Philadelphia lead that earlier had reached 16 points.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie,\" Conley said, \"These whole last couple of weeks have been like just barely missing, barely not making shots, and missing shots I would normally make and feeling good while doing it.\"\n\nMarc Gasol scored 18 points and 12 rebounds, while Garrett Temple finished with 17 points, including a 3-pointer - after an offensive rebound by Gasol - with 39 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime tied at 102.

Bickerstaff said. \"He understands how vital he is to us, the load that he has to bear. He's been getting in extra work.\"\n\nJ.J.

Joel Embiid had 14 points and 16 rebounds for Philadelphia, but was 4 of 15 from the field.\n\nThe game marked the second time in two nights Philadelphia went to overtime. The Sixers defeated the Charlotte Hornets 133-132 in overtime at home Friday night.\n\nAsked about the fatigue factor, Sixers coach Brett Brown said: \"I didn't feel it. You think it would, you know with overtime (against Charlotte), flight, overtime (Saturday) and so on. But I didn't feel it.\"\n\nAs for whether emotions of the changing teammates contributed, Redick said: \"I thought we played hard. Us playing back-to-back. Overtime games are tough. I thought we handled ourselves well in that regard.\n\n\". As Jerryd Bayless says: The game is the game.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSixers: The Sixers dressed only nine because of the players involved in the trade were not available. ...

(AP Photo/Michael Woods) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Ed Orgeron could be heard screaming encouragement through the door of the LSU locker room following a 24-17 victory over Arkansas on Saturday night.\n\nIt wasn't the prettiest of finishes to an otherwise dominant victory, but the coach of the No. 9 Tigers (8-2, 5-2 Southeastern Conference) was all about restoring a sense of swagger after a disheartening home loss to No. 1 Alabama a week ago.\n\nLed by Joe Burrow and a dominating defensive effort, LSU did just that while winning for the third straight time over the struggling Razorbacks (2-8, 0-6).\n\nBurrow was 15 of 21 for 195 yards and a touchdown, and the Tigers allowed only 91 yards of Arkansas offense through three quarters on their way to improving to 8-0 under Orgeron in games following a loss. The Tigers haven't lost back-to-back games since dropping three straight in 2015.\n\n\"It was good to get on the plane, it was good to get out of Baton Rogue and come to a tough place to play,\" Orgeron said. \"Although it wasn't pretty, we won the football game and our guys feel good about themselves.\"\n\nJustin Jefferson had six catches for 117 yards, including a 40-yard touchdown for the game's first score. Nick Brossette added 90 yards rushing and a touchdown, but it was the LSU defense that set the tone early before allowing two fourth-quarter touchdowns.\n\n\"We played LSU football,\" Tigers safety JaCoby Stevens said. \"Coach O wants us to play tough, mean and nasty, and that's what we did.\"\n\nThe Razorbacks managed a season-low 216 yards of total offense - including only 16 yards on the ground - while losing their ninth straight SEC game dating to last season. They are the only school in the SEC without a conference victory this season.\n\nTy Storey completed 19 of 38 passes for 200 yards and two touchdowns to tight end Cheyenne O'Grady for Arkansas.\n\nThe Razorbacks have lost three straight to LSU and eight of their last nine games under first-year coach Chad Morris.\n\n\"We knew they were an elite defense, and they definitely showed that,\" Morris said.\n\nArkansas trailed 24-3 in the fourth quarter before Storey connected on the two touchdown passes to O'Grady \u2014 the second of which closed the LSU lead to 24-17 with 5:27 remaining.\n\nThe Tigers, however, closed out the win on offense by putting together a nine-play, 58-yard drive. Brossette had the final four rushes of the game and purposely fell down short of the goal line on his last two carries to ensure LSU was able to run out the clock and secure the much-needed bounce-back win.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSo much for any lingering after effects from last week's loss to the Crimson Tide for LSU, at least defensively. The Tigers bested their previous best defensive effort of 254 total yards allowed, which they did against Southeastern Louisiana on Sept. 8. They forced Arkansas to punt on its first six possessions, and the only points LSU allowed in the first half came after a fumble that gave the Razorbacks the ball deep in Tigers' territory late in the half.\n\nARKANSAS TARGET\n\nRazorbacks defensive lineman Michael Taylor was called for targeting and ejected from the game following a hit on Burrow in the second quarter. The sophomore hit Burrow near the top of his back and into his helmet on the play, but he still finished with two tackles and a sack.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nAfter falling four spots to No. 7 in the College Football Playoff rankings following last week's loss to Alabama, the Tigers reasserted their position as one of the country's best \u2014 and kept alive their slim hopes of finishing among the top four teams at the end of the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Tigers step out of conference to host Rice.\n\nArkansas travels to Mississippi State.\n\n___\n\nhttps://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Quinn Cook did an admirable job late last season for Golden State when Stephen Curry was hobbled by knee and ankle injuries. With the two-time NBA MVP sidelined again, Cook is ready to do it again.\n\nKevin Durant showed with his passing that he can do a pretty good imitation of Curry, too.\n\nDurant had 28 points and 11 assists, Cook scored a season-high 27 and the Warriors used another big run in the third quarter to pull away and beat the Brooklyn Nets 116-100 on Saturday.\n\n\"I just feel like Quinn thinks that he's always supposed to be ready no matter what,\" Durant said. \"When his number is called he's able to go out there and produce, and that's just because of the work he puts in every day. It's no surprise to me that he can do this.\"\n\nTwo days after losing Curry to a groin injury in a 23-point home loss to Milwaukee, Golden State bounced back behind Cook with little problem while their leading scorer sat at home watching.\n\nSigned on a two-way contract a year ago when he made 18 starts with Curry out, Cook looked just as comfortable this time around. He made his first seven shots and matched Durant with 19 points in the first half, then made a shot-clock beating 19-footer in the third to push the Warriors lead to 103-81.\n\n\"That's the mark of a pro,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \"He's a great fit for us. Always prepared and always ready. His role is going to swing wildly based on our health and what's happening out on the floor but he's always ready.\"\n\nCook hasn't played much this season but said the experience he got last year was a big factor in keeping him ready when his turn came up.\n\n\"Our guys do a great job of always making you feel important, making you feel a part of the team, even when you aren't playing,\" Cook said. \"I felt comfortable out there and we got it done.\"\n\nDraymond Green was also missing from Kerr's lineup but Durant - with a lift from Cook - made both absences a moot point while ending Brooklyn's three-game winning streak.\n\nThe nine-time All-Star had 13 points in the first quarter, scored the final six of the second then came up big again in the third when the Warriors led by as many as 20.\n\nGolden State needed it on a night when their other Splash Brother, Thompson, had an off night shooting. Thompson made four of his first five shots but finished 11 of 20.\n\nJoe Harris scored 24 points for the Nets. Spencer Dinwiddie added 14 points and six assists and DeAngelo Russell had 12 points.\n\n\"You had Durant and Thompson, and (Cook) did a Curry imitation tonight,\" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. \"You could argue he made the difference tonight. He really scored the ball well.\"\n\nGOTTA BE THE SHOES\n\nDinwiddie has taken full advantage of the NBA's relaxed policy on shoe colors and has worn a different pair each night. Earlier this season Dinwiddie wore a pair of white shoes with a picture of 11-time All-Star Allen Iverson. With the Nets in the Bay Area, Dinwiddie switched things up again and had shoes that were inscribed with the word WITH across the top of one and KAP on the other, along with a picture of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick on the side.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNets: Russell left the game late in the fourth quarter as a precaution after appearing to injure his hand while reaching for the ball. ... Brooklyn has lost eight straight to Golden State. ... The Nets haven't won our consecutive games since a six-game streak in 2014-15.\n\nWarriors: Golden State is 51-12 following losses since 2014-15. ... Curry did not play as expected but was feeling better after getting some work in with team trainer Rick Celebrini at the team's downtown facility. \"I saw him this morning,\" Kerr said. \"He had better mobility, less pain so it's a good sign.\" The two-time NBA MVP is nursing a mild to moderate left groin strain suffered Thursday in the loss against Milwaukee. ... Green missed his second straight game because of a sprained right toe. ...

(AP) \u2014 Ignas Brazdeikis watched helplessly as his future Michigan teammates got drubbed in last season's NCAA championship game.\n\nOn Saturday night, Brazdeikis finally got a chance to help boost the Wolverines' struggling offense.\n\nBrazdeikis scored 19 points, Charles Matthews added 20 and No. 19 Michigan held off Holy Cross 56-37.\n\nThe freshman from Mono, Ontario, scored 15 points in the first 4:49 of the second half as part of a 32-8 game-changing run that gave Michigan a commanding lead.\n\n\"I need to keep that going because that's the player I've always been my entire life,\" Brazdeikis said. \"As long as I continue that mentality, things will happen.\"\n\nMichigan (2-0) now heads into a NCAA final rematch with Villanova on Wednesday.\n\n\"They're hunters,\" Michigan coach John Beilein said of Brazdeikis and Matthews. \"We just really simplified our attack in the second half and just tried to go off penetration. We weren't outsmarting them. We just had to go with some speed, some quickness, and certainly Iggy got us off to a nice start.\"\n\nReserve forward Connor Niego scored 13 points for Holy Cross (1-1), all on 5-of-5 shooting in the first half, including 3 for 3 on 3-pointers. He did not score in the second half, missing two shots.\n\nJacob Grandison scored 12 points for the Crusaders, who led by as many as nine points in the first half and led 24-18 at halftime.\n\n\"We passed the ball around pretty nicely and got some open shots and some easy baskets, and they were missing some things that maybe they normally make in the first half,\" Holy Cross coach Bill Carmody said. \"Then the second half they just turned up the heat.\"\n\nMichigan forced 16 turnovers in the game and held Holy Cross to 13 points in the second half.\n\nBut the Wolverines shot poorly, finishing 3 of 19 (15.8 percent) on 3-pointers. However, they had a big edge on free throws, shooting 17 of 21 (80.9 percent), while Holy Cross was 1 for 3.\n\nIsaiah Livers had seven points and 10 rebounds for Michigan, as six Wolverines scored.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nHoly Cross: The Crusaders look to be a team ready to improve on their sixth-place finish in the Patriot League last season.\n\nMichigan: With shooting the big question mark coming into the season, Michigan didn't silence doubts early, shooting 5 for 24 (20.8 percent) in the first half, including 2 of 11 (18.2 percent) on 3-pointers.\n\nWIN 801\n\nBeilein was honored before the game and given a ball to commemorate his 800th victory, which was Tuesday against Norfolk State.\n\nBeilein also was presented with a portrait of himself, which was painted by a speed artist at halftime. Upon seeing the painting before the postgame news conference, he asked his wife Kathleen where it should go.\n\n\"I thought we'd put it right over the fireplace,\" she said, before he added: \"I don't think it's going . I know it's not going over our fireplace.\"\n\nSTILL WAITING\n\nHoly Cross last beat a Big Ten team on Dec. 21, 1992, topping Northwestern 83-78. The Crusaders have now lost six straight against the conference.\n\nHoly Cross has just one win against a ranked opponent in its last 34 chances, dating to 1977.\n\nUPSET MINDED\n\nHoly Cross used a 13-0 run to take an 18-9 lead midway through the first half. Niego had a pair of 3-pointers during the run.\n\nBLOCK PARTY\n\nMichigan center Jon Teske had a career-high five blocked shots, many off layup attempts after successful Holy Cross cuts.\n\n\"When it works right and somebody comes out of nowhere and pins it off the board, it is heartbreaking for the team,\" Beilein said \"It is demoralizing for the team and we were able to do that.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHoly Cross plays at Providence on Tuesday. The Friars, of the Big East, have made the NCAA Tournament five straight seasons, a program record.\n\nMichigan plays at No. 9 Villanova on Wednesday in the Final Four rematch, a 79-62 Villanova win.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Zach LaVine delivered another solid effort for Chicago, yet his only turnover of the game nearly cost the Bulls a victory.\n\nLaVine scored 24 points, rookie Ryan Arcidiacono added 15 and the Bulls rebounded after blowing an early 16-point lead to edge the Cleveland Cavaliers 99-98 on Saturday night.\n\nWendell Carter Jr. also had 15 points as Chicago won for the second time in six games.\n\nLaVine has scored 20 more points in each of Chicago's 13 games this season and in a career-high 14 straight overall, dating to his final game of 2017-18. The last Bulls player to score 20-plus points in 14 consecutive games was Jimmy Butler, who did it 15 straight times in 2016.\n\n\"I thought it was Zach's best game as far as making the simple play,\" coach Fred Hoiberg said. \"We've really been on him about making the right play and the right read, and tonight I thought he was really about that when they were blitzing him on the floor.\"\n\nBut Cleveland nearly pulled this one out after LaVine's lone turnover\n\nWith 13 seconds left, Carter couldn't handle LaVine's pass and Cleveland recovered. Coach Larry Drew called a timeout to set up a final play, but Cavs rookie guard Collin Sexton was blocked by Jabari Parker as he drove to the basket at the buzzer.\n\n\"I made a dumb mistake at the end,\" LaVine said. \"I shouldn't have nonchalant passed it to Wendell. That was my bad, but we made a good stand.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old LaVine was flashy at times, scoring on several highlight-reel dunks. Arcidiacono, making his first career start, scored 10 of his points in the first half.\n\n\"I thought I was able to get into a rhythm when I got a few defensive possessions and got on the floor once,\" Arcidiacono said.\n\nTristan Thompson had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the league-worst Cavs. Sexton scored a season-high 20 points in his second straight start and second of his career.\n\nStill, the 19-year-old couldn't connect on the final shot as he played more than 34 minutes.\n\n\"I felt like I got to my spot and that was the right spot,\" Sexton said. \"They told me to take that, I'm going to make it the next time.\"\n\nDrew said Sexton executed the final play perfectly. Parker just stopped him.\n\n\"We got the shot that we wanted,\" Drew said. \"It was clear off of Collin, he got all the way to the basket and the ball didn't go in.\"\n\nRodney Hood also had 20 points and Jordan Clarkson came off the bench to score 15, but the Cavaliers lost their fifth straight. Cleveland's only win this season was on Oct. 30 over Atlanta.\n\nCavs forward Cedi Osman sat out the game with back spasms. He was forced to leave Wednesday's loss to Oklahoma City in the first quarter, becoming the latest Cavs player to join an injury list that includes All-Star forward Kevin Love, point guard George Hill and forward Sam Dekker.\n\nThe Bulls came out firing, shooting 64 percent from the floor through the first quarter and taking a 37-23 lead as LaVine scored 11 points and Arcidiacono had 10.\n\nThen Chicago opened its biggest lead, at 16 points, when Antonio Blakeney hit a running jumper 42 seconds into the second quarter.\n\nBut Cleveland roared back to tie it 53-all at halftime as it outscored Chicago 30-16 in the second quarter, including a 9-0 run. The Cavs' bench, led by Clarkson with 10 points and Kyle Corver with eight in the quarter, led the comeback.\n\nChicago led 79-77 after three quarters.\n\nBUTLER TRADE REACTION\n\nBulls coach Fred Hoiberg thinks Butler, who spent his first six seasons with Chicago, will be \"really good fit\" with the Philadelphia 76ers. Butler is being traded from Minnesota to Philadelphia in a package that sends Dario Saric and Robert Covington to the Timberwolves, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press on Saturday.\n\n\"I think (Philadelphia has) three of the best players at their position in (Joel) Embiid and (Ben) Simmons,\" Hoiberg said. \"He brings a toughness. He's a guy who's a great player in the clutch. He's a player that guys are going to go out there and guard every time he steps on the floor.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nCavaliers: Guard Andrew Harrison, signed to a two-way contract, made his debut with the Cavs and played 13 minutes off the bench. He did not score. Harrison made 64 starts over the past two seasons for Memphis, but was waived by the Grizzlies after one game this season. ... With Osman out, JR Smith and Larry Nance Jr. were Cleveland's starting forwards. ... Against the Thunder on Wednesday in his first career start, Sexton played 42 minutes and had 15 points while shooting 7-for-14 from the field.\n\nBulls: Arcidiacono replaced Cameron Payne, who had started in 11 of Chicago's first 12 games, in the starting lineup. Payne didn't play Saturday. \"(Arcidiacono) is a guy who is going to go out there and play with toughness,\" Hoiberg said. \"He's somebody we feel deserves this opportunity to go out there.

He added three rebounds and five assists. Booth missed most of 2016-17 with knee issues and part of last season with a hand injury. He's now averaging 20 a game through two contests.\n\nVillanova (2-0) led by double digits from the 13:10 mark of the first half onward and led by as many as 37.

Villanova, which shot 7 of 15 from beyond the three-point arc in the first half, got a three pointer from freshman Saddiq Bey before the first half buzzer sounded to take a 47-20 lead into halftime.\n\nThe Wildcats, at that point, had more points on three pointers than the Bobcats had total points. Villanova forced nine first half turnovers.\n\n\"Our full-court pressure really did a good job,\" Wright said.\n\nJoining Booth in double figures for the Wildcats were sophomore guard Collin Gillespie, who shot 4 of 6 from deep and finished 16 points, and senior forward Eric Paschall, who scored 11 points on 4-of-6 shooting and added eight rebounds and three assists.\n\nCameron Young's 18 points paced Quinnipiac.\n\nHOMECOMING\n\nDunleavy played at Villanova in the early 2000s under Wright and later joined his coaching staff in 2010.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 John Wall and Austin Rivers have seen more than enough losing lately.\n\nSo they decided to do something about it.\n\nWall scored 28 points, he and Rivers each scored 10 in the pivotal fourth quarter and the Washington Wizards got a much-needed win by topping the Miami Heat 116-110 on Saturday night. The Wizards opened the fourth on a 31-12 run, with Wall and Rivers fueling most of that effort.\n\n\"It was probably one of our best games, how we played,\" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \"We played a physical brand, we fought for one another and I thought we made timely passes and shots.\"\n\nJeff Green had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards. Rivers scored 18, as did Bradley Beal, and the Wizards won for only the third time in 12 games to start the season.\n\n\"You work hard all summer, throughout the season, to prepare yourself for those type of moments,\" Wall said. \"Austin got into a great rhythm.\"\n\nWashington opened the fourth on a 31-12 run, before the Heat trimmed what was as much as a 17-point deficit down considerably in the final minutes but never seriously threatened again. Dwight Howard finished with 11 points and 16 rebounds for the Wizards, who outrebounded Miami 48-38 \u2014 the first time Washington won that stat battle all season.\n\nThe Wizards also got a boost at the foul line, shooting 28 for 38 there compared with 20 for 26 by Miami.\n\n\"We had moments where we competed defensively, and we had other moments where I didn't recognize our team,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nJosh Richardson scored 24 points and Rodney McGruder had a career-high 22 for the Heat. Wayne Ellington added 16 points, Hassan Whiteside finished with 15 points and 14 rebounds and Tyler Johnson scored 12 points for Miami.\n\nThe Heat were again without Dwyane Wade, who sat a third consecutive game after the birth of his daughter. Goran Dragic returned after missing Miami's last two games with right knee inflammation, but he struggled and shot 0 for 7 in 21 minutes.\n\nMiami led 35-25 after one quarter and pushed its lead out to 12 early in the second, and couldn't finish. Washington was within three by halftime, two going into the fourth and took what was then its largest lead of the night \u2014 six points, 92-86 \u2014 when Wall connected on a foul-line jumper to cap a 9-1 spurt that opened the fourth.\n\nAnd that set the tone for the finish. A night after Washington trimmed a 25-point deficit down to one late but fell in Orlando, it finished the job in Miami.\n\n\"There shouldn't be any team that's more desperate than us,\" Ellington said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nWizards: Washington evened the season-series with Miami at 1-1, with both clubs winning on the road. ... Even with the win, going back to last season and including the playoffs, the Wizards are just 8-22 in their last 30 games. ... Green made his first seven shots and finished 8 for 11. ... Howard had seven offensive rebounds.\n\nHeat: Kelly Olynyk needed treatment throughout the day after getting kneed in the rib area by Indiana's Tyreke Evans on Friday night. He played but was limited to 13 minutes, scoring five points. ... This was the 20th home back-to-back in Heat history, and only the third time they dropped both ends of such a set.\n\nBACK TO BACK\n\nSaturday completed the first back-to-back of the season for Washington \u2014 which still has 14 left to play. The Wizards are one of four teams playing 15 of the sets this season; no team has more. Miami has already finished three back-to-backs, ending two of them against Washington, and has only nine remaining.\n\nIN FRONT\n\nWith the victory, Brooks moved ahead of Spoelstra on the NBA career winning percentage list \u2014 by an extremely slim margin. Brooks is now 433-288 (.60055) and Spoelstra is 489-327 (.59926).

(AP Photo/Karl B DeBlaker) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Detroit trailed Carolina by two goals heading into the third period. Turns out, the Red Wings had the Hurricanes right where they wanted them.\n\nAnthony Mantha scored twice and Frans Nielsen netted the deciding goal in the shootout as the Red Wings erased a two-goal deficit for the third straight game and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 Saturday night.\n\n\"That's kind of our sweet spot right now,\" Detroit coach Jeff Blashill said. \"Maybe next game, we'll start down two.\"\n\nMantha scored two quick goals at 6:04 and 9:02 of the third period to rally the Red Wings, who have won six of their last seven.\n\nThe Hurricanes built a 52-32 advantage in shots, but Detroit goalie Jonathan Bernier made a career-best 49 saves and stopped all three shots he faced in the shootout.\n\n\"He just played amazing tonight,\" Mantha said of Bernier. \"All the credit goes to him. He made huge saves in key moments.\"\n\nNielsen beat Carolina goalie Scott Darling in the shootout for the Red Wings, who have won 17 of their last 19 games that have gone to a shootout.\n\nAfter winning only once in their first 10 games, the Red Wings have been resilient. They beat the New York Rangers after falling behind 2-0 in third period and trailed Vancouver 2-0 on Tuesday.\n\n\"We just need to figure out a way to play 60 minutes now,\" Mantha said. \"Make it a tad easier on ourselves.\"\n\nBrock McGinn, Micheal Ferland and Dougie Hamilton scored for the Hurricanes, who have won once in their last seven games.\n\nSebastian Aho and Teuvo Teravainen led the Hurricanes with two assists each.\n\nThe Hurricanes got two acrobatic saves from Darling in overtime but failed to capitalize on a power play in the final 15 seconds of OT.\n\nIt was not the way the Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour wanted to start a six-game homestand, especially after taking the 3-1 lead into the third period.\n\n\"To me, it was just the third period,\" Brind'Amour said. \"We took our foot off the gas and it cost us.\"\n\nMantha was Carolina's biggest problem in the third. On the tying goal, he got out in transition but Carolina defenseman Brett Pesce blocked his first shot. The puck bounced right back to Mantha, who scored on his next shot.\n\nMantha, who entered the game with a team-worst minus-13 rating, scored for the first time since Oct. 30.\n\n\"Obviously, it wasn't going my way these last couple of games and managed to put two in the back of the net today, so that feels good for confidence,\" Mantha said.\n\nMantha took care of the scoring and Bernier did the rest. In his sixth start of the season, the Detroit backup stopped 17 shots in the second period, when Blashill thought his team was out-played.\n\nBernier made a difficult save on Andrei Svechnikov at 13:09 in the second period to keep Carolina's lead at 2-1.\n\n\"He allowed us to stay in the game when we weren't good enough,\" Blashill said. There were times in the second period when we were bad.\"\n\nAfter falling behind 1-0, the Hurricanes scored three straight goals. Bernier stopped an odd-angle chance from Aho but the puck bounced free to Hamilton, who swatted in the rebound with a backhand for the 3-1 advantage at 17:01 in the second period.\n\nThe Hurricanes have been slumping since a 4-0-1 start to the season. Meanwhile, the Red Wings have found a way to rally after a 1-7-2 start.\n\n\"Obviously, we had a tough start to the year, but I think things are falling into place right now,\" Mantha said.\n\nNOTES: Nielsen has made 50 percent (49 of 98) of his career shootout attempts. He holds the NHL shootout record for goals and shootout-deciding goals (23). ... Brock McGinn, Jaccob Slavin and Aho failed to score in the shootout for Carolina.

(AP Photo/Paul Vernon) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 New York gave up twice as many shots as it took, but Jimmy Vesey found the back of the net with the deciding goal in the shootout to get the Rangers another win.\n\nVesey, who also had the game-tying goal at the end of the second period, beat Joonas Korpisalo on the glove side in the fifth round of the shootout to give the Rangers a 5-4 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday night for New York's fifth in the last six games (5-0-1).\n\nVesey scored in the tiebreaker right after Columbus' Oliver Bjorkstrand was stopped by Alexandar Georgiev, the backup who had started in place of Henrik Lundqvist in the second game of a back-to-back. The Rangers improved to 4-0 in shootouts this season.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident when we go into shootouts because our guys are so skilled,\" said Georgiev, who had 34 saves and picked up his third win in four starts this season.\n\nThe game remained tied 4-4 through the third period despite an 11-2 shot advantage by Columbus, and a scoreless 5-minute overtime period.

Columbus tied it late in the first when Dubois threaded a pass into Atkinson, who tipped it in for a power-play goal.\n\nAnother odd-man rush allowed Buchnevich to beat Korpisalo and give the Rangers the lead in the second period. Kreider tapped in his team-leading eighth goal of the season off a nice pass from Kevin Hayes later in the second to make it 3-1.\n\nColumbus tied the game again in the second with two goals in a 32-second span. Dubois got credit for redirecting a Jones one-timer , and Foligno tipped in the second from the door step on a rush.\n\nWennberg got his first of the season, a short-handed tally off the post to put the Blue Jackets ahead. But the Columbus lead didn't last long.

Georgia Tech won 27-21. (AP Photo/John Amis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Tech's timeshare at quarterback may be a thing of the past.\n\nTaQuon Marshall is back in full-time control of the Yellow Jackets' offense.\n\nMarshall ran for 92 yards with two touchdowns and threw for a score as Georgia Tech scored 13 points off Miami's three lost fumbles to beat the struggling Hurricanes 27-21 on Saturday night.\n\nMarshall had shared the position with freshman backup Tobias Oliver since suffering an undisclosed injury against Duke on Oct. 13. But he played almost the full game against Miami. Oliver made only a brief appearance but wasn't even on the field for a full series.\n\n\"It felt good to be out there,\" said Marshall, who also threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Brad Stewart in the third quarter. \"... I think I knocked a little bit of the rust off.\"\n\nGeorgia Tech (6-4, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) has won three straight games and five of six to become bowl-eligible. The Yellow Jackets failed to qualify for a bowl in two of the last three seasons.\n\n\"I'm happy for the kids,\" said Georgia Tech coach Paul Johnson. \"I told them after the game that we've still got a lot to play for in these next two games.\"\n\nMiami (5-5, 2-4) continued to see its once-promising season fall flat with its fourth straight loss.\n\n\"We've having a bad season right now but we can change this momentum,\" said Hurricanes cornerback Michael Jackson. \"We can't listen to nobody because they're going to say you're no good. We've just got to stay together.\"\n\nIt was Mark Richt's first loss in 10 games as a head coach at Bobby Dodd Stadium, including his 15 years with Georgia.\n\nTravis Homer's 2-yard scoring run midway through the final quarter cut Georgia Tech's lead to six points, capping a 95-yard drive. Freshman quarterback N'Kosi Perry also led a 75-yard touchdown drive in the first quarter.\n\n\"It shows what we can do once we've got everything clicking,\" Perry said. \"... We just hurt ourselves with the turnovers.\"\n\nMarshall had touchdown runs of 28 and 8 yards on Georgia Tech's first two possessions. The second scoring run followed a lost fumble on a kickoff return by DeeJay Dallas.\n\nPerry's fumbled snap was recovered by Georgia Tech's Charlie Thomas at the Miami 39, setting up Wesley Wells' 38-yard field goal for a 17-7 lead.\n\nMiami's third lost fumble came early in the third quarter. Jeff Thomas called for a fair catch on a punt before fumbling the ball in front of the Hurricanes' end zone. Juanyeh Thomas recovered for Georgia Tech at the 10, leading to Wells' second field goal of the game, a 23-yarder.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMiami: The Hurricanes couldn't overcome an avalanche of mistakes, including the two lost fumbles on returns and seven penalties for 49 yards. After the impressive opening drive, they consistently stopped themselves until the short touchdown drive set up by Georgia Tech's only turnover.\n\nGeorgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets' top-ranked running attack gained 231 yards against Miami's defense, second in the nation in total yards allowed. The Yellow Jackets held the ball the final 6:43, denying Miami a chance for a go-ahead touchdown.\n\nPERRY'S GAME\n\nRicht stuck with Perry as senior Malik Rosier watched from the sideline. Perry completed 14 of 23 passes for 165 yards and had six carries for 38 yards.\n\n\"I thought the kid did a really nice job,\" Richt said. \"I was glad to see that. ... I thought he threw the ball with confidence.\"\n\nFORCED TURNOVERS\n\nThe forced turnovers were the continuation of a trend for Georgia Tech's defense. Entering the night, the Yellow Jackets had forced 20 turnovers, tied for the eighth-highest total in the nation.\n\nDAVIS STEPS UP\n\nMiami freshman Cam'ron Davis scored his first career touchdown on a 22-yard run with 50 seconds remaining in the first half. Davis led Miami with six carries for 48 yards after entering the game with only six carries for 27 yards for the season. Richt said Davis had more practice snaps this week because Homer was limited by an injury.\n\n\"He got his moment and proved he belongs in that backfield and I'm proud he did,\" Richt said.\n\nFASHION STATEMENT\n\nMiami players wore all-black uniforms as their answer to Georgia Tech's whiteout.

(Joshua L. Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 D'Andre Swift is still hurting.\n\nImagine how opposing defenses must be feeling.\n\nSwift turned in a career-best performance for the second week in a row, rushing for 186 yards Saturday night and breaking loose on a 77-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter that finished off No. 5 Georgia's 27-10 victory over Auburn.\n\nThe Bulldogs struck for a pair of touchdowns late in the first half to take control.\n\nSwift took it from there, following up a 156-yard effort at Kentucky with an even better game in the Deep South's oldest rivalry.\n\nNot bad for a guy who said he's still bothered by nagging injuries.\n\n\"I'm definitely getting better,\" Swift said. \"I'm a 7 or 8 (out of 10). My foot's still messed up from LSU. My groin is a little dinged up.\"\n\nHaving already locked up a spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game, the Bulldogs (9-1, 7-1, No. 5 CFP) couldn't afford to slip up against the Tigers. They finished with 303 yards rushing \u2014 the second straight week they've eclipsed 300 yards on the ground.\n\n\"We knew what was at stake,\" Swift said. \"We were playing for a lot more than they were playing for, so we didn't want them to mess up our future.\"\n\nIt took Georgia a while to get going. Trailing 10-6 with the first half winding down, the Bulldogs faced third-and-4 from the Auburn 14 and the prospect of bringing on kicker Rodrigo Blankenship for a third field goal attempt. But Jake Fromm connected on a touchdown pass to Tyler Simmons that pushed the home team ahead with 2:47 remaining.\n\nAuburn (6-4, 3-4, No. 24 CFP) went three-and-out, giving Georgia a chance to add to its lead.\n\nSwift broke off a 24-yard run before two short completions left the Bulldogs with fourth-and-3 at the Tigers 38. After letting the clock run down to 29 seconds, Georgia went with no-back alignment and Fromm found Terry Godwin breaking free over the middle.\n\nGodwin hauled in the pass without breaking stride and didn't go down until he tumbled into the end zone for a TD that suddenly pushed Georgia to a 20-10 lead at the break.\n\nSwift tacked on the clinching score, darting through a hole up the middle, brushing off a would-be tackler and finding a clear running lane down the left sideline.\n\n\"I don't remember what I did,\" Swift said with a smile. \"I'll probably see it on my phone. But when I'm running, it just comes to me.\"\n\nAuburn's only touchdown came from a bit of trickery. Out of the wildcat formation, running back JaTarvious Whitlow took a direct snap and threw a 9-yard scoring pass to tight end John Shenker late in the first quarter.\n\nIn the end, it was another disappointment in a season that began with such high hopes.\n\n\"I'm telling everybody to keep their head up,\" safety Daniel Thomas said. \"We've got to keep playing for each other and stay together.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAuburn: The Tigers failed to build on their comeback victory over Texas A&M, doomed once again by a sluggish offense. Jarrett Stidham missed several open receivers and threw for just 163 yards. The running game showed improvement, finishing with 102 yards, but this performance is sure to keep the heat on offensive-minded coach Gus Malzahn.\n\nGeorgia: The offense still looks a bit out of sync, settling for a couple of field goals instead of touchdowns. They'll need to get that sorted out to have any chance against No. 1 Alabama in the SEC championship game. But Swift's emergence is big news for the Bulldogs, giving them a true dual threat in the backfield with Elijah Holyfield, who rushed for 93 yards.\n\nBIG KAT BANISHED\n\nSophomore defensive end Big Kat Bryant was ejected in the first half after lowering his helmet into a Fromm, a targeting penalty that was especially needless because the Georgia quarterback already was getting sacked when Bryant dove at him head first. The Auburn player also will have to sit out the first half of next week's game against Liberty.\n\nIT'S A FAKE!\n\nIn a rather puzzling move, Georgia tried a fake field goal in the closing minutes with the outcome no longer in doubt.\n\nBlankenship lined up for a 26-yard attempt, but instead received a direct snap and lofted a pass down the middle for Isaac Nauta. The tight end was open, but Blankenship's pass sailed over him by a couple of yards.\n\nRECORD SETTER\n\nRyan Davis has now caught more passes than any player in Auburn history. His 13 receptions gave him 165 in his career, surpassing Courtney Taylor's mark of 153 from 2003-06.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWith the top four schools winning easily Saturday and No. 6 Oklahoma barely surviving against Oklahoma State, Georgia should remain right where it is in The Associated Press rankings.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams have a breather next Saturday before closing out the regular season against their state rivals.\n\nGeorgia hosts UMass (4-7), an independent FBS school that was blown out by Boston College in its only game against a Power Five school this season. Auburn returns home to take on FBS independent Liberty (4-5), which will be coming off a 45-24 loss to Virginia.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Coach Luke Fickell describes his running back as \"built for November.\" So far, his surprising Bearcats are, too.\n\nMichael Warren II ran for three touchdowns and caught a pass for another score Saturday night, leading 25th-ranked Cincinnati to a 35-23 victory over South Florida that kept the Bearcats in the chase for the American Athletic title.\n\nThe Bearcats (9-1, 5-1) remain a game behind unbeaten UCF for the AAC East lead. No. 11 UCF beat Navy 35-24 and hosts Cincinnati next Saturday.\n\nCincinnati moved back into the Top 25 after a 42-0 win over Navy. The Bearcats are leaning on their versatile running back in their most important games. Warren came through again.\n\n\"I don't know what to say about him,\" Fickell said. \"Sometimes you're not sure he's going to be able to continue doing what he's done. His ability to do everything is what makes him special.\"\n\nWarren had a 13-yard touchdown catch in the first half. He ran for three touchdowns in the third quarter, including a 57-yarder, and set a school record with his 18th TD of the season.\n\n\"I wasn't aware,\" the sophomore said about his record. \"I didn't even know what the numbers were.\"\n\nHis teammates know something special happens when he gets the ball. Warren has scored in all but one game this season.\n\n\"Just keep the cameras on Mike,\" defensive end Kimoni Fitz said. \"He's always making plays.\"\n\nSouth Florida (7-4, 3-3) has lost three straight conference games for the first time since 2013. It didn't help that the Bulls were missing their prolific quarterback against the league's stingiest defense.\n\nBlake Barnett hurt his shoulder during a 41-15 loss to Tulane . The Bulls waited until the end of the week to decide Barnett wouldn't be able to play.\n\nHis backups got a few big plays, but not much else.\n\nSophomore Chris Oladokun made his first career start and threw for a 72-yard touchdown on his first attempt. Junior Brett Kean replaced him in the second quarter and threw a 38-yard touchdown to Mitch Wilcox on his third attempt, helping USF take a 16-14 halftime lead before Warren took over.\n\n\"We watched Blake all week and hoped he'd get better, but by Friday we had to make a decision to go with the two quarterbacks,\" coach Charlie Strong said. \"With what they were trying to do to us we thought Chris could use his legs to make some plays to get out of danger. The quarterbacks played all right.\" Oladokun was 10 of 22 for 165 yards. Kean was 4 of 10 for 67 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSouth Florida's defense wanted to show significant improvement after giving up 57 points \u2014 a school record \u2014 in a loss to Houston followed by 41 against Tulane. The Bulls were better for a half, but the defense was on the field a lot with the offense unable to move consistently.\n\nCincinnati accomplished its main goal \u2014 staying in the title chase. Now it's head-to-head for the East lead.\n\nBABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE\n\nAbout 20 South Florida players warmed up shirtless, but some of them wore facemasks against the sub-freezing temperatures.

Week 11 in college football answers these questions and much more. USA TODAY\n\nOhio State defensive backs Kendall Sheffield (8), Jeffrey Okudah (1) and Damon Arnette celebrate after their win against Michigan State. (Photo: Mike Carter, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOhio State\u2019s 26-6 win at Michigan State will never be confused with a masterpiece. Quarterback Dwayne Haskins averaged just 5.8 yards per attempt. Sophomore running back J.K. Dobbins accounted for just 28 yards on 14 carries, though teammate Mike Weber went for 104 yards on 22 touches.\n\nThe Buckeyes converted just 6 of 18 third downs, gained only 347 yards of offense and averaged a measly 2.7 yards per carry. This despite controlling the ball for more than 37 minutes \u2013 the sort of box score you\u2019d normally equate more with Michigan State than the Buckeyes.\n\nIt\u2019s nonetheless a win that matters on multiple fronts, most notably in how it maintains the Buckeyes\u2019 fingerhold on a spot in the College Football Playoff. After games against Purdue and Nebraska that revealed flaws, Ohio State responded with a 20-point win on the road against a team currently ranked 18th in the latest playoff rankings.\n\nThe selection committee will take notice. Could the Buckeyes move ahead of No. 9 West Virginia, which had no issues in a 47-10 win against TCU? It\u2019s certainly possible. What about ahead of two-loss LSU, which is severely over-ranked at No. 7? That\u2019ll come eventually, if not this Tuesday night.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to nitpick the win, pointing out the Buckeyes\u2019 issues on offense in specific, but Saturday provided the sort of win that Ohio State needed to put some wind in its sail heading into a winner-take-all finale against Michigan to end November.\n\nAnd one question was answered, if against an offense best described as unpredictable: OSU\u2019s defense responded against a quality opponent after getting torn apart by both the Boilermakers and Cornhuskers. In all, the win at Michigan State keeps the Buckeyes on track to at least factor into the Playoff chase all the way through the season\u2019s final month.\n\nHere are the rest of Saturday\u2019s winners and losers:\n\nWinners\n\nNorthwestern\n\nCongratulations are in order for Pat Fitzgerald and the Wildcats, who clinched the program\u2019s first Big Ten West Division title with a 14-10 win at Iowa. It\u2019s been a strange year for Northwestern, which went 0-3 in non-conference action but is now 6-1 in league play and headed for a matchup with either Michigan or Ohio State to decide the Big Ten title. A win there would send Northwestern to the Rose Bowl.\n\nTennessee\n\nThe Volunteers notched the second noteworthy win of Jeremy Pruitt\u2019s debut season, joining an early victory against Auburn, by knocking off Kentucky 24-7. Not that Kentucky is anywhere near as good a team as its lofty College Football Playoff ranking might suggest \u2013 the Wildcats are better than average, but boosted enormously by the reputation of the SEC. Still, it\u2019s the sort of win that supports the idea that Pruitt was the right hire after a tumultuous offseason coaching search.\n\nPittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh took another significant step toward an ACC Coastal Division championship by rolling past Virginia Tech, 52-22, in the Panthers\u2019 latest scoring outburst. It\u2019s a nice reminder how quickly a team\u2019s fortunes can change. Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi had his future with the program questioned just last month; now, at 5-1 in league play, he\u2019s got the Panthers on the doorstep of an appearance in the ACC title game.\n\nAlabama\n\nIt\u2019s nearly a perfect win for Nick Saban, at least. A 24-0 victory against Mississippi State featured just enough ineffectiveness to provided Saban with the ammunition he needs in his never-ending fight against \u201crat poison\u201d \u2013 the waves of positive coverage that typically greets the No. 1 Crimson Tide. This won\u2019t help, but think about it: Alabama played a subpar game relatively speaking, and still beat a top-20 opponent by 24 points in a shutout.\n\nClemson\n\nThis was a Boston College team that was going test Clemson one way or another, though the Tigers did themselves no favors with a series of fruitless red-zone trips in the first half. That the Tigers weren\u2019t humming stood in contrast to the past month, which featured one blowout win after another, but the win itself is still telling: Clemson has passed the toughest test left on its road to an undefeated regular season. Remember that each of the Tigers\u2019 last two teams lost once in the regular season and still reached the playoff.\n\nAlabama-Birmingham\n\nUAB topped Southern Mississippi 26-23 in overtime to move to 9-1 and clinch the Conference USA West Division. What Bill Clark has achieved with the Blazers is remarkable: UAB went on a two-year hiatus from 2015-16 and is now 17-6 since returning to action last season. This year\u2019s team could crack the Amway Coaches Poll before the end of the season.\n\nOld Dominion\n\nODU hasn\u2019t won much in 2018 \u2013 just three games \u2013 but the Monarchs are a lock to make it interesting. Down 28-0 in the second quarter against high-powered North Texas, ODU went on a 34-3 run capped by a touchdown with 15 seconds left to win 34-31.\n\nTexas\n\nThe Longhorns will remain in the Big 12 hunt after winning a thriller at Texas Tech, 41-34, with the go-ahead touchdown coming with 21 seconds left. UT survived a monster game from Tech\u2019s Jett Duffey, who threw for more than 440 yards, but got an outstanding performance from its own quarterback, Sam Ehlinger, who threw four touchdowns without an interception.\n\nNebraska\n\nYou\u2019re beginning to see signs of a team set to take a huge step forward in the next 12 months. Nebraska\u2019s 54-35 win against Illinois was the program\u2019s third in four games, sandwiching last week\u2019s 36-31 loss at Ohio State. The Cornhuskers are starting to put it together.\n\nLosers\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nThe Gamecocks lost to Florida 35-31 despite holding a 31-14 lead with a minute left in the third quarter. This is the sort of loss that fans, players and coaches linger on for months and months, long after the conclusion of the regular season. To make matter worse, think about the scenario: Florida in its first season under Dan Mullen \u2013 a team that is clearly a work in progress \u2013 found enough in the tank to beat South Carolina and former UF coach Will Muschamp.\n\nFlorida State\n\nFor pure ugliness, you\u2019d think it\u2019d be hard to top that season-opening loss to Virginia Tech, especially as the Hokies find themselves wallowing in mediocrity. On the other hand, Notre Dame is now 10-0 and two wins shy of a playoff berth. Even still, the Seminoles\u2019 42-13 loss to the Irish has to be the lowest pint of Willie Taggart\u2019s debut season: FSU trailed 32-6 at halftime and never came within a whiff of one of college football\u2019s few unbeaten teams. With Boston College and Florida still to come, it\u2019s highly unlikely the Seminoles extend college football\u2019s longest bowl streak.\n\nWisconsin\n\nInjuries have played a huge role, robbing the Badgers of a number of key contributors on both sides of the ball, but it\u2019s nearly shocking to enter the midpoint of November and see Wisconsin at 6-4 overall and 4-3 in Big Ten play. The latest loss, 22-10 at Penn State, ends any hopes of winning a division title. This was a team some pegged as the best in the conference and a contender for the Playoff. Instead, the Badgers are playing for a mid-tier bowl as the season enters its final two weeks.\n\nColorado\n\nOnce 5-0, the Buffaloes are now 5-5 and in danger of missing bowl play after a 31-7 loss at home to Washington State. What may be worse, however? That Washington State\u2019s fan base took over the Buffaloes\u2019 home field as the Colorado fan base filed out of the stadium in the second half.", "MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Dalton Sneed threw for 220 yards and three touchdowns, linebacker Dante Olson set a program record and Montana beat Idaho 46-27 on Saturday for the Little Brown Stein.\n\nSneed threw for 182 yards and three touchdowns in the first half to help Montana build a 36-6 lead.

(AP) \u2014 The Florida Panthers are starting to gain momentum.\n\nAleksander Barkov scored the go-ahead goal in the third period, and the Panthers beat the New York Islanders 4-2 on Saturday night.\n\nTroy Brouwer, Mike Hoffman and Denis Malgin also scored for the Panthers, who won their third straight. Roberto Luongo made 29 saves for his third straight win after missing nearly a month with a knee injury.\n\n\"I think we're finding a pretty good rhythm,\" Luongo said. \"Heading into the third period we have that confidence that we're going to pull it out, whether they're tied, ahead or trailing. It's a little bit of the same feeling toward the end of last year and it's just a matter of keeping going here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Islanders are losing steam.\n\nBrock Nelson and Mathew Barzal scored goals for New York, which has lost three in a row after winning its previous five.

We want to stop it now and get going.\"\n\nBrouwer recorded an empty-net goal with less than a second remaining.\n\nThe Panthers went ahead 3-2 on a 4-on-3 power play at 4:43 of the third period when Barkov's shot from the left circle beat Lehner, who was screened on the play by Jonathan Huberdeau.\n\n\"All I had to do was just put it in because (Huberdeau) was there and made a really good screen,\" Barkov said.\n\nNelson put the Islanders ahead 2-1 on his wrist shot from the slot at 8:10 of the second.\n\n\"Tonight, we were in a pretty good spot on the road, tied, just go out there and win a period and win a game,\" Nelson said. \"We weren't able to do it.

Hoffman backhanded a pass from behind the net that deflected off the skate of defenseman Ryan Pulock into the net, extending Hoffman's points streak to 11 games.\n\nThe Panthers took a 1-0 lead on Malgin's goal. Jared McCann passed from behind the net out to Malgin, who pushed the puck past Lehner at 6:18 of the first. The goal was Malgin's first of the season.\n\nThe Islanders tied it just over a minute later when Barzal flipped a backhanded shot past Luongo on a breakaway. Nelson leads the Islanders with eight goals.\n\n\"We were up 2-1, then gave up a late goal, then 2-2.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Jason Shelley may be a freshman and undersized for a major college quarterback, but he doesn't lack confidence.\n\n\"We know what we can do. We know we can play. We're here for a reason,\" Shelley said. \"We couldn't wait to prove it.\"\n\nIn his first start, Shelley ran for two touchdowns and Armand Shyne had 174 yards rushing to power Utah past Oregon 32-25 on Saturday.\n\nThe Utes (7-3, 5-3 Pac-12) lost Tyler Huntley, their starting quarterback, and running back Zack Moss, who had already rushed for 1,092 yards this season, to injury within a few days of each other.\n\n\"They could either pick up the slack and move forward or feel sorry and mope and pout. But that is not us. That is not our culture,\" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said of his team, which stayed atop the Pac-12 South standings.\n\nShelley utilized quick passes, a strong running game and some misdirection in the offense to complete 18 of 31 passes for 262 yards with no interceptions.\n\n\"He rose to the occasion tonight,\" Whittingham said.\n\nOn a drive keyed by a 36-yard pass to Jaylen Dixon, Shelley punched in the go-ahead touchdown from 2 yards out with 6:48 to play.\n\n\"It was a pretty exciting debut for me,\" Shelley said and then chuckled at his understatement.\n\nThe Utah defense, which dominated in the first quarter and then was on its collective heels when Justin Herbert starting finding receivers all over the field, stopped the Ducks (6-4, 3-4) on the ensuing possession when Jaylon Johnson broke up a fourth-down pass.\n\nHerbert went 20-for-33 for 288 yards but was sacked four times and simply ran out of time. Dillon Mitchell caught eight passes for 169 yards and two touchdowns, including multiple acrobatic grabs.\n\n\"We knew he was going to make some plays. He's a really good quarterback and has some good guys around him,\" said Utah's Chase Hansen, who had 3.5 tackles for loss and 13 overall.\n\nUtah lost more than 80 percent of their offensive firepower when Huntley broke his collarbone at Arizona State and Moss's knee locked up early in the week and put him on crutches. But that didn't faze Shelley and Shyne.\n\n\"We don't get nervous. We just play football,\" Shelley said.\n\nShyne's running prowess bolstered a sustained drive that gobbled up Oregon's time outs and culminated in Matt Gay's sixth field goal from 24 yards \u2014 a new school record.\n\n\"It felt good,\" Shyne said. \"It reminded me of when I was playing a couple years ago.\" That was before Moss asserted himself as one of the nation's top backs and Shyne struggled with injuries.\n\nAfter Utah's last score, the Ducks had only 15 seconds to drive the entire field. Herbert got one completion but the clock ran out as he spiked the ball on second down. The officials ran off the field \u2014 trailed by some of the Oregon coaches \u2014 and then returned to announce the time had indeed expired after video review.\n\nKano Dillon blocked a punt at the Utah 3-yard-line, which led to Herbert's touchdown pass to Travis Dye. Herbert rolled out to his right again and hit Jaylon Redd for a two-point conversion and Oregon led for the first time, 25-22.\n\n\"I felt that we had momentum,\" Ducks linebacker Thomas Graham said. \"As a defense, we stepped up in the second half but we gave up that deep ball in the second half and didn't give our offense another chance.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUtah: The only major drawback to the Shelley-led attack was failing to finish drives. Gay bailed out the offense, including a 55-yarder on the final play of the first half to make it 19-7. \"We just wanted to get Matt Gay some field goals,\" Shelley deadpanned, but earlier had said, \"I'm glad he made them but I'd rather have touchdowns.\"\n\nOregon: The Ducks began the day two games behind Washington State in the Pac-12 North and their loss, along with WSU's 31-7 win over Colorado, eliminated Oregon from contention in the division. \"It's progress in terms of getting things going after a rough start, but there's no comfort in progress,\" Oregon coach Mario Cristobal said.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\"I think he's the best kicker in the nation ... if you give him the opportunity, he converts,\" Whittingham said of Gay.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Ducks play host to Arizona State \u2014 which has won three in a row, including a 38-20 win over Utah \u2014 next Saturday.\n\nUtah travels to Boulder to take on Colorado next Saturday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Crosby, streaking down the right side, lifted a backhander from a sharp angle over the shoulder of a standing Kuemper.\n\n\"He was coming with a lot of speed,\" Kuemper said. \"I didn't even go down. I wasn't really over-cheating. He just made a really good shot and made me look silly.\"\n\nSimon extended the lead 1:52 later when he redirected a Bryan Rust pass behind Kuemper from the top of the crease.\n\nHornqvist made it a 3-0 game with 15.3 seconds to play in the second period. Hornqvist one-timed a behind-the-net feed from Simon over Kuemper's blocker.\n\nIt was more than enough to help the Penguins snap their losing streak.\n\n\"It's one win,\" Crosby said. \"I think the goal is to play every game like this one and give ourselves a chance every night.

(AP Photo/Raymond Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHold up on handing Tua Tagovailoa the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThe Alabama quarterback looked only OK in the top-ranked Crimson Tide's shutout of No. 18 Mississippi State . And a chronically cranky knee again kept him from finishing the game. After tearing through the first two months of the season with what looked like one of the great offenses in college football history, Alabama now looks like the 1985 Chicago Bears.\n\nThis all still bodes well for the Crimson Tide's national championship hopes. Drop 50 or allow nothing. Alabama is capable of either. But Tagovailoa's pedestrian effort (14 for 21 for 164 yards with a touchdown and an interception) against a good Mississippi State defense could make Heisman voters take another look at other candidates \u2014 like No. 6 Oklahoma's Kyler Murray.\n\nMurray's numbers have stacked up well to Tagovailoa's throughout the season, but the Tale of Tua has been tough to top. The sophomore has been piling up touchdowns while not even needing to take a snap in the fourth quarter. Tagovailoa is up to 28 touchdown passes on the season, with just two picks. He will probably take next week off when Alabama takes its November FCS break against The Citadel. Then the Iron Bowl and SEC championship game against No. 5 Georgia will provide more than enough opportunity for Tagovailoa to wrap up the third Heisman of Nick Saban's tenure. The Tide never had a Heisman winner until Mark Ingram won it in 2009 and Derrick Henry took it in 2015.\n\nMurray, meanwhile, had another huge game, throwing for 349 yards and running for 66 in a wild Bedlam victory against Oklahoma State . West Virginia's Will Grier is still hanging around the Heisman race, too. He had three touchdown passes in a blowout of TCU . And there is Washington State's Gardner Minshew, who has the Cougars pointed toward a Pac-12 title after throwing for 335 yards and two TDs against Colorado . Having the most famous mustache in the college football should help get Minshew to New York as a finalist.\n\nMurray's escape against Oklahoma State means the Sooners and Mountaineers are still on target for a first-place showdown in Morgantown the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nOf course, the bigger concern for Alabama is not the Heisman but Tagovailoa's balky knee which seems to send him into the sideline injury tent every week.\n\n\"Tua got hit low a few times out there today,\" Saban said after the game. \"I think he's OK.\"\n\nBUCKEYES D\n\nNo. 8 Ohio State seemed to get its defense back in order in what turned out to be a lopsided victory against No. 24 Michigan State . The Buckeyes allowed a season-low 54 yards rushing, 47 on one long quarterback keeper by Rocky Lombardi, and held the Spartans to 18 for 48 passing (37.5 percent).\n\nGive some credit to Ohio State. The Buckeyes have been a mess of missed tackles, poor angles and blown assignments, leading to big plays for opponents. Ohio State was more sound, but Michigan State's offense is also totally dysfunctional. The real MVP for the Buckeyes was punter Drue Chrisman, who buried Michigan State at its own 6 or worse on five straight punts.\n\nThe Buckeyes get Maryland next week in Columbus before No. 4 Michigan comes to town Thanksgiving weekend in a game that will likely decide the Big Ten East and eliminate the loser from playoff contention.\n\nAwaiting the Buckeyes or Wolverines in the Big Ten title game in Indianapolis will be Northwestern. Coach Pat Fitzgerald's Wildcats put a spell on another Big Ten opponent, this time Iowa , and pulled out another weirdly ugly victory. Call in FitzMagic.\n\nCombined with losses by Purdue and Wisconsin, the Wildcats (6-4) have their first Big Ten West title. The team that lost to Akron. The team that has outscored its opponents this season by six measly points. The team that came into the Iowa game being outgained by 20 yards per game and then proceeded to be outgained by the Hawkeyes by 27.\n\nNorthwestern, division champs.\n\nDOES ANYBODY WANT A GREAT BOWL TRIP?\n\nSomething to keep an eye on down the stretch is what teams earn high enough rankings from the College Football Playoff selection committee to fill a few at-large spots in the Peach and Fiesta bowls. The best Group of Five champion will get one of those and likely a trip to the Fiesta Bowl. Unbeaten and No. 12 UCF has the inside track.\n\nNo. 9 LSU (No. 7 CFP) looks to be in good shape to secure one of those spots, whether it wins out or not. The second-best of West Virginia and Oklahoma also seems to be heading for a big-time bowl.\n\nWho else? No. 12 Kentucky (No. 11 CFP), No. 17 Boston College (No. 17 CFP) and No. 22 North Carolina State (No. 14 CFP) all took a third loss this weekend. No. 13 Syracuse (No. 13 CFP) could be a candidate if it wins out but the Orange have to go through No. 3 Notre Dame and BC. Whoever gets that last spot is not going to look particularly impressive.\n\nAROUND THE COUNTRY\n\nSigns seemed to be pointing toward Southern California keeping coach Clay Helton, but losing to Cal for the first time in 15 years can change the conversation. USC faces UCLA next week ... No. 19 Florida rallied to beat South Carolina and former head coach Will Muschamp behind a huge rushing day for the Gators. Dan Mullen's team went for 367 yards on 62 carries, and 528 yards total. In four seasons with Muschamp as coach (2011-14), Florida broke 500 yards of offense in an SEC game three times ... Arizona State improved to 3-0 in games decided by three points with a 31-28 victory against UCLA . Herm Edwards' Sun Devils have games at Oregon and against Arizona left. Win them both and they are in the Pac-12 title game. ... Pitt's Darrin Hall has run for 415 yards the last two weeks after getting 186 on seven carries in a victory against Virginia Tech , putting the Panthers in position to clinch the ACC Coastal by beating Wake Forest next week. ... Remember when Virginia Tech was in the Top 25? The Hokies now need to win out to extend their 26-year streak of bowl appearances. ... Houston defensive tackle Ed Oliver missed a third straight game with a sore knee and you have to wonder if the likely high first-round NFL draft pick will play again this season. Houston has now lost three games. The Cougars could still reach the AAC title game, but with a major bowl highly unlikely the risk of returning might not be worth the reward.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

(AP) \u2014 Down by six points with two minutes to play, Oregon coach Kelly Graves chose \"to let the flow go\" rather than call a timeout.\n\nIt worked.\n\nSabrina Ionescu had 26 points and 10 rebounds and Erin Boley made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 51 seconds left, helping the third-ranked Ducks top No. 18 Syracuse 75-73 on Saturday.\n\n\"That's why Sabrina is Sabrina,\" Graves said. \"I told her, 'You played like an All-American tonight,' and that's what she's supposed to do.\"\n\nIonescu, a preseason All-America guard coming off her 11th career triple-double, hit back-to-back 3-pointers to spark an 11-0 run after the Orange had scored 10 straight points to take a 67-61 lead.\n\n\"I just did everything I could to not lose that game,\" Ionescu said. \"They had left me open and I knew it was time that I had to hit some big-time shots, and my teammates got me the ball.\n\n\"As soon as I released it, I knew they were going in, just with the adrenaline and that desire to not lose.\"\n\nBoley's 3 from the corner put Oregon ahead to stay at 70-67. It capped a rough 5-for-19 shooting night for the redshirt sophomore transfer from Notre Dame, including 3 for 12 from beyond the arc.\n\n\"I wanted to contribute in any way that I can,\" said Boley, who sat out last season. \"Not every night are you going to be able to shoot the lights out.\"\n\n\"Erin hit the really big one when it mattered,\" Ionescu added. \"I thought down the stretch we executed well.\"\n\nMaite Cazorla hit four free throws in the final 30 seconds and finished with 14 points for the Ducks (2-0).

Gabrielle Cooper and Amaya Finklea-Guity added 11 points each.\n\nCooper's 3-pointer gave the Orange their first lead at 62-61, but Syracuse was just 5 for 28 (17.9 percent) from beyond the arc. Oregon countered with 5 of 9 in the fourth quarter from long range and 11 of 31 overall (35.5 percent).\n\nThe Orange won the rebound battle 45-36 and outscored the Ducks in each of the final three quarters after getting off to a tough start. Syracuse shot 40.3 percent (31 for 77) from the floor, compared to 35.5 percent (23 for 63) for Oregon.\n\n\"We didn't make shots, so we couldn't get into our pressure (defense) at all in the first half,\" Syracuse coach Quentin Hillsman said. \"It was horrible for us.\n\n\"Give our kids a lot of credit against the No. 3 team in the country on the road. There were a lot of opportunities where they could have laid down and folded, and they didn't. They kept fighting and gave us a chance to win.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSyracuse traveled to the West Coast looking for a challenge and nearly escaped with a win despite shooting poorly in the first half. The Orange also face Texas A&M, Kansas State, DePaul and Minnesota in preparation for Atlantic Coast Conference play.\n\nOregon fought off the upset by finding a way to score over Syracuse's 2-3 zone before a home crowd of 6,789. The Pac-12 champions have another heavyweight challenge in five weeks when No. 6 Mississippi State visits Eugene.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nOregon is likely to hold its spot at No. 3, though it may lose some votes after the close call at home. Syracuse could get some bounce from its comeback, if it can take care of business against No. 20 Texas A&M.\n\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT\n\nOregon missed all six of its 3-pointers in the second quarter but made 8 of 20 in the second half.\n\n\"We're one of the best shooting teams in the country and we just didn't shoot it all that well tonight,\" Graves said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSyracuse faces another ranked opponent, No. 20 Texas A&M, on Wednesday night at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, New York.\n\nOregon plays at Utah State on Wednesday night in the second of six road games on its 12-game nonconference schedule.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Eli Lucero/The Herald Journal via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOGAN, Utah (AP) \u2014 A record-setting performance moved Utah State one step closer to playing for the Mountain West Conference championship.\n\nThe 14th-ranked Aggies totaled 804 yards of offense and 33 first downs on their way to a 62-24 win over San Jose State on Saturday. They broke a school record for yardage and became just the 17th team in NCAA history to gain at least 800 total yards in a game.\n\nIt gave Utah State (9-1, 6-0 MW) a ninth straight victory. The Aggies are the only team undefeated in Mountain West play.\n\n\"We want to be on a collision course for the Mountain West championship,\" Utah State coach Matt Wells said. \"Our goals are consistent around here. I've said that since when I got hired.\"\n\nJordan Love threw for a career-high 491 yards and five touchdowns on 32-of-42 passing in just three quarters to lead the Aggies. Love's 491 passing yards were the third-highest single game total for a Utah State quarterback.\n\nDarwin Thompson had 140 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries along with 115 yards and a pair of scores on four receptions for the Aggies.\n\nUtah State was equally impressive on the other side of the ball. The Aggies held San Jose State to 56 rushing yards and forced three turnovers.\n\n\"We literally talked about things we wanted to do in January and we're watching it happen now,\" senior safety Jontrell Rocquemore said. \"It's probably one of the best feelings I can describe to be able to do it.\"\n\nJosh Love threw for 210 yards and a touchdown, along with a pair of interceptions, to lead San Jose State. Tre Walker added a career-high 209 yards and two touchdowns on seven catches for the Spartans (1-9, 1-5 MW), who lost their second straight game.\n\nUtah State shook off a slow start and quickly buried San Jose State before halftime. The Aggies piled up 453 total yards and 22 first downs in the first half. Jordan Love passed for 326 yards and three touchdowns before halftime.\n\n\"Their quarterback is brilliant,\" Spartans coach Brent Brennan said. \"Obviously, his ability to deliver the ball accurately while under duress is amazing.\"\n\nThe Spartans initially seized a 7-0 lead after capitalizing on a special-teams mistake by the Aggies. Utah State punter Taylor Hintze tried to get off a punt after fielding a low snap. The ball sailed right into the arms of Tre Jenkins at the line of scrimmage, and Jenkins returned the punt 41 yards for a touchdown.\n\nUtah State evened the score on a 42-yard catch by Jordan Nathan that capped off the team's second drive. Then, in the second quarter, the Aggies took over.\n\nGerold Bright took a screen pass and raced 24 yards to break a 10-10 tie in the first of four consecutive drives that ended in touchdowns. Jordan Love punched one in on a 1-yard keeper. Bright got his second touchdown on a 29-yard run that Tipa Galeai set up when he tipped a pass to himself for an interception at the Spartans' 29. Thompson finished it off by hauling in a 7-yard pass from Love to give USU a 38-10 halftime lead.\n\nLove threw his final two touchdown passes in the third quarter \u2014 a 37-yard strike to Jalen Greene and an 88-yarder to Thompson \u2014 to extend Utah State's lead to 59-17 with 4:33 left in the quarter.\n\nREWRITING THE RECORD BOOK\n\nUtah State's 2018 team will go down in school history as fielding the most potent offense. The Aggies shattered multiple school records on Saturday.\n\nBesides getting 804 total yards \u2014 the third most by an FBS team this season \u2014 Utah State also set season records for points and touchdowns. The Aggies have totaled 513 points this season, eclipsing the previous high mark of 454 points set in 2012. Their 68 touchdowns blew past the prior record of 60, set in 2011.\n\nThe Aggies believe they are capable of more.\n\n\"You ask our players and they'll tell you we haven't played our most complete game yet,\" Wells said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSan Jose State: A promising start soon faded for the Spartans. San Jose State gave up multiple big plays to allow the Aggies to pull away. There's plenty of work for coach Brent Brennan to do on both sides of the ball to make the Spartans competitive.\n\nUtah State: Few defenses are equipped to handle Utah State's speed and efficiency. Utah State had eight scoring drives that lasted less than three minutes and three that took less than a minute off the clock.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nUtah State should continue to climb in the AP Top 25 after a record-setting performance and could finally crack the Top 25 in the CFP Poll on Tuesday. It would position the Aggies for a potential New Year's Six Bowl if they win out and UCF stumbles.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSan Jose State: Hosts Nevada next Saturday.\n\nUtah State: At Colorado State next Saturday\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Wallace caught 10 passes for 220 yards and two scores. Chuba Hubbard ran for 104 yards and three scores, but he lost a critical fumble in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn all, Oklahoma State gained 640 yards in a rough outing for Oklahoma interim defensive coordinator Ruffin McNeill's unit.\n\n\"Were we at our best tonight? No,\" Riley said. \"Especially in the first half. Especially there. We did miss more tackles than we have been missing. It's something that we're going to have to do better.\"\n\nOklahoma State took a 35-34 lead in the third quarter on Hubbard's 2-yard run, but the Sooners responded quickly.

Oklahoma State has allowed at least 30 points in five straight games.\n\nOklahoma: The Sooners continue to score almost at will, but their defense, though showing signs of improvement, continues to struggle.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Sooners shouldn't be hurt by the close victory over the unranked Cowboys, who have wins over Boise State and Texas.\n\nLOTS OF KICKS\n\nOklahoma kicker Austin Seibert became the all-time Big 12 Conference and Oklahoma career scoring records. He scored 12 points against the Cowboys to increase his career total to 458. Baylor's Aaron Jones (2010-13) and TCU's Jaden Oberkrom (2012-15) shared the previous Big 12 record of 451 points. Michael Hunnicutt (2011-14) held the former Oklahoma record of 450 points.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWallace's 220 yards were the ninth-most in a single game in Oklahoma State history.

Week 11 in college football answers these questions and much more. USA TODAY\n\nOklahoma wide receiver Marquise Brown scores a touchdown past Oklahoma State cornerback Tanner McCalister. (Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. \u2013 Maybe we should just chalk it up to Bedlam. Because, well, by definition.\n\nBut let\u2019s make sure to highlight the defense, or lack thereof. Because fair or not \u2013 but it seems pretty fair, doesn\u2019t it? \u2013 every game Oklahoma plays seems marked by sketchy performances on that side of the ball. Obviously, the most important thing is winning, but the Sooners are also playing, at least in part, against perception.\n\nWhich is why even as No. 6 Oklahoma\u2019s 48-47 win against Oklahoma State keeps the Sooners\u2019 College Football Playoff hopes alive, it did nothing to further their argument. Here are three takeaways:\n\n- Next time someone wonders why the playoff selection committee chairman often seems to question Oklahoma\u2019s defense, just bring up Bedlam.\n\nYeah, the defense came up with a critical stop with a turnover \u2013 nose guard Neville Gallimore forced a fumble from running back Chuba Hubbard with 6:09 left in a tie game, ending an Oklahoma State drive and setting up the go-ahead touchdown.\n\nYeah, after giving up a touchdown on fourth-and-12 with 1:03 left, they escaped when cornerback Tre Brown broke up Oklahoma State\u2019s two-point conversion try.\n\nYeah, they won.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear now that Oklahoma\u2019s midseason change at defensive coordinator to Ruffin McNeill has not appreciably changed much. For most of the day, Oklahoma State quarterback Taylor Cornelius had his pick of open receivers. To win, the Sooners must outscore opponents and win shootouts. Fortunately, with Kyler Murray and his array of weapons, that\u2019s usually doable.\n\n- Oklahoma State\u2019s meteoric season \u2013 nice highs, weird lows \u2013 almost reached its highest peak so far. Taylor Cornelius threw for 304 yards in the first half. Repeat: 304 yards in the first half, en route to a career high 501 yards. The fifth-year senior quarterback riddled Oklahoma\u2019s secondary. Despite his yards and grit \u2013 and several drops by receivers \u2013 there were also some bad misfires from Cornelius, which led to this: What if the Sooners had faced a better quarterback? Like, say, West Virginia\u2019s Will Grier (see Nov. 23 in Morgantown)?\n\n- Kyler Murray will get the lion\u2019s share of credit for Oklahoma\u2019s victory, because it\u2019s what we do with quarterbacks these days. But junior receiver Marquise Brown made two huge plays to help the Sooners get the lead back late in the third quarter. Trailing 35-34, Oklahoma faced third-and-12 from its 26. Brown took a short pass and then, as he appeared set to be stopped well shy of the first down, shimmied past a defensive back for a 20-yard gain. Two plays later, Brown corralled Murray\u2019s deep pass between two defenders, setting up the Sooners at the 9. They scored two plays later.\n\nAnd Oklahoma\u2019s offensive line created holes for a run game that caught and sparked in the fourth quarter. On the drive to take the lead, five of six plays were runs.", "SAN MARCOS, Texas (AP) \u2014 Zac Thomas passed for 247 yards and two touchdowns and Darrynton Evans added a pair of TD runs to propel Appalachian State to a 38-7 victory over Texas State on Saturday.\n\nThe Mountaineers (7-2, 5-1 Sun Belt Conference) jumped out to a 7-0 lead on their first possession when Thomas connected with Dominique Heath from the 8-yard line.

We had a bunch of injuries, lost some tough games there. The brotherhood in that locker room is the glue that kept everything together.\"\n\nBennett Skowronek's 32-yard touchdown, which came off an incredible catch in the fourth quarter, gave the Wildcats a 14-10 lead they wouldn't surrender.\n\nAfter a first half that yielded just three total points on a field goal from Iowa kicker Miguel Recinos, the scoring ramped up in the second.\n\nBowser hit a hole for a 34-yard touchdown to give the Wildcats their first lead of the game.\n\nBowser was the only Wildcat to surpass 45 yards from scrimmage other than quarterback Clayton Thorson, and his performance certainly gave Northwestern a boost after a first half in which it only posted 75 total yards.\n\n\"I think (the touchdown) got us going,\" Bowser said. \"Obviously, not scoring in the first half, so coming out and scoring in the second half, that was big for our offense and big for our defense too, knowing that they had a lead.\"\n\nAfter Recinos missed a field goal to respond, Iowa safety Jake Gervase intercepted Clayton Thorson's pass off a tip.\n\nIowa cashed in just two plays later with Nate Stanley's 28-yard touchdown pass to Ihmir Smith-Marsette.\n\nThe Hawkeyes had a chance to take the lead late in the fourth, but Northwestern's Cameron Ruiz forced Mekhi Sargent to fumble, and the Wildcats jumped on it.\n\nIowa had one final chance with under two minutes to go, but another fumble by Ivory Kelly-Martin ended the Hawkeyes' chances.\n\n\"They outplayed us,\" Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz said. \"They've worked hard, they've invested and I thought they competed hard. But I guess it wasn't good enough.\"\n\nStanley threw for 269 yards and a touchdown for Iowa (6-4, 3-4), losers of three straight.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNorthwestern: Folks might chide the Big Ten for having a four or even five-loss team represent the league in its championship game. But the fact of the matter is that the Wildcats are 6-1 in the conference for the first time since 1996, when they won nine games and played in the Citrus Bowl.\n\nIowa: What a disastrous turn of events in Iowa City. Three weeks ago, fans were wondering if this was one of the most talented teams coach Kirk Ferentz has ever had. Now they're simply hoping to finish above .500 in the Big Ten.\n\nMISSING MEN\n\nThe Hawkeyes were without receiver Brandon Smith, fullback Brady Ross, and tight end Shaun Beyer, while the Wildcats took the field down cornerback Trae Williams, safety Jared McGee and kicker Charlie Kuhbander. Cornerback Montre Hartage also left the game early, hurting the Wildcats' depth even more.\n\nKuhbander's injury could have been bad news for Northwestern, as punter Jake Collins missed a 38-yard field goal that would have given the Wildcats a lead. Northwestern's offense covered for him, though, scoring a touchdown on its next drive.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nWith a 3-0 lead, Iowa attempted to pin the Wildcats inside their own 5 and Josh Turner was there to down the ball, but it rolled into the end zone anyway.

(AP Photo/Matthew Putney) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 A weird game ended with another wonderful result for Iowa State.\n\nNow the Cyclones have to wait and see on the status of star running back David Montgomery.\n\nBrock Purdy threw for a touchdown and ran for another score, and No. 23 Iowa State topped Baylor 28-14 on Saturday after a skirmish in the third quarter resulted in unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for each player on both teams.\n\nPurdy threw for 230 yards as Iowa State (6-3, 5-2, No. 22 CFP) won a fifth straight Big 12 game in the same season for the first time. Deshaunte Jones added a TD reception and threw for a 2-point conversion, and Iowa State shut out Baylor on five of its seven trips to the red zone.\n\n\"There's still a lot of work to be done. We're still a young football team,\" Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \"I think what's exciting is that I sit here right now knowing that our best is still out there.\"\n\nPurdy's 11-yard TD pass to Jones and his 2-yard touchdown run helped Iowa State to a 17-0 halftime lead.\n\nBaylor (5-5, 3-4) answered with a Charlie Brewer TD pass, but Matt Eaton fought through a defensive pass interference call for a 38-yard catch that set up Johnnie Lang's 8-yard touchdown run and a 28-7 Cyclones lead.\n\nThe game took an ugly turn when Montgomery and Baylor linebacker Greg Roberts were ejected after briefly fighting each other early in the third.\n\nThe Cyclones and Bears nearly came to blows when a previous play ended up spilling over onto Iowa State's bench. The bad blood hung around, and the teams nearly staged a full-on brawl during a wild incident that included Roberts slapping Montgomery on the helmet, and Montgomery swinging away in response.\n\nCampbell said he wanted to review the tape before commenting on the incident, though he did defend Montgomery.\n\n\"David is a leader, so the last thing that I would say that David Montgomery had anything to do with was starting any controversy,\" Campbell said. \"It certainly looked like it was a secondary action.\"\n\nMontgomery finished with 53 yards rushing. The Big 12 will review the incident, and Montgomery could be suspended for the first half of next weekend's huge game at Texas.\n\nBrewer threw for 288 yards and two touchdowns. But he was ejected for his second unsportsmanlike penalty with 5:51 left.\n\n\"This was a case of us beating ourselves and not taking advantage of opportunities, most importantly in the red zone and playing at the end of the game without our quarterback because of the earlier decisions by someone else to get involved in a fight,\" Baylor coach Matt Rhule said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIowa State: Bowl eligibility used to be the main goal at Iowa State, but not anymore. The Cyclones, once 1-3, can clinch a once-improbable spot in the Big 12 title game with two more wins and a West Virginia loss \u2014 and the Mountaineers still have to play Oklahoma. \"It's just a mark of who we are, and who we've been coached up to be,\" receiver Hakeem Butler said.\n\nBaylor: A win over TCU or Texas Tech in its final two games would send the Bears to a bowl game \u2014 and, perhaps more importantly, an extra month of practice for their rebuilding efforts.\n\nOVERLOOKED MOMENT\n\nBaylor appeared to gain a first down inside the Iowa State 1 late in the second quarter on a catch by Marques Jones. Brewer then quick snapped and sneaked into the end zone, which would have made it 14-6. But officials waved Brewer's TD off, reviewed the Jones reception and waved that off after it showed the ball clearly hit the ground. Connor Martin then badly shanked a 29-yard field goal.\n\nALMOST BREWING\n\nWith 8:05 left, Chris Platt beat Iowa State's defense on a vertical route and was open near the end zone. Brewer hit a diving Platt on the hands, but the ball instead went through them. That drive ended on downs at Iowa State's 12 with 4:49 left.\n\nMONTGOMERY'S REACTION\n\nMontgomery used his Twitter account to apologize for his ejection, saying in part that he \"should have not reacted the way I did and I sincerely apologize for that!!! But I will defend my brothers no matter what and i stand on that!\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIowa State faces No. 15 Texas in Austin next week.\n\nBaylor hosts TCU on Saturday in its home finale.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And so we took that into account and we think it was something we should look at.\"\n\nNot all the players are in favor of the rack, with top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who beat Australian teenager Alex de Minaur in Saturday's final, being a particularly vocal critic.\n\n\"One thing that I didn't like that much was the towel thing,\" the world No. 15 said earlier in the week. \"I was always, you know, had to run for the towel, always had it in my mind when I was playing.\n\n\"I think having the towels whenever you need it, it's very helpful. It's one thing less that you have to think about. So I believe to be playing your best game you just don't need to think about whether you're going to take your towel now or later. You can just call the ball kid. I think the ball kid, it's their job to provide towels and balls for the players.\"\n\nAlexander Zverev wasn't in Milan as he is instead preparing for the ATP Finals in London, but he had a dig at Tsitsipas and others who he thinks use the towel too much.\n\n\"I heard Tsitsipas say it's the ball boys' job but it's the ball boys' job to give you balls \u2014 that's what I see the ball boys as,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"I think you should also prevent players from taking the towel after every single serve and every mishit return, sometimes it does get a little bit ridiculous in my eyes. So maybe it will prevent it from that.\"\n\nThe towel rack is just one of the new rules being applied, along with on-court coaching, shorter sets, no-Ad scoring, medical timeout limits, and no lets on serve.\n\nFor the players, the most popular innovations are the shot clock, and Hawk-Eye making all the line calls.\n\nThe on-court clocks enforce the 25-second rule between points, and shorter warm-ups ensure matches begin four minutes after the players enter the court.\n\n\"Shot clocks for sure are going to soon be on (the tour), I can see that happening very quickly. Reduced warm ups, I think the electronic line calling ... all of those things can happen quite easily I think,\" Kermode said. \"In the next couple of years I can see those coming onto the tour.\"\n\nThe most drastic change is the shorter set, where the first to four games takes the set, with a tiebreak at 3-3.\n\nAnd Kermode admitted that changing the scoring system would need a lot more consideration and analysis.\n\n\"The attractive thing of tennis is that you have different styles of play, you have different court surfaces ... and how tennis currently stands is that everyone has a shot at winning,\" he said. \"You have the big servers and you have the baseliners who play a bit more chess-like \u2014 and we want to make sure that both elements of styles can compete.\"\n\nThe idea for the tournament was first discussed three years ago with a two-fold reasoning behind it: to highlight the next generation of players and to bring in a new generation of fans.\n\nHowever, Kermode insists they will not be rushing into anything.\n\n\"We're looking 10 years ahead for the sport and I've said right from the beginning we're not going to rush into doing any dramatic changes but, whilst tennis is doing so well, from a position of strength, we want to take our time now to look to the future.\n\n\"The assurance that I want to give everybody is we will only be doing things if we think it is better. And that's why this is a test.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOULDER, Colo. (AP) \u2014 The 10th-ranked Washington State Cougars weren't in any hurry to bury the Buffaloes.\n\nGardner Minshew II had all day to pick his targets and he overcame a slow start and three fourth-down failures to lead the Cougars past Colorado 31-7 on Saturday.\n\nThe Cougars (9-1, 6-1 Pac-12, No. 8 CFP) won their sixth straight, but it wasn't as easy as expected against the Buffaloes (5-5, 2-5), who lost their fifth straight despite the return of star receiver Laviska Shenault Jr.\n\nWashington State led by three at the half and seven heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThey did dominate the clock, however, winning the time of possession by nearly 24 minutes and holding the Buffaloes to an average drive of just 1:38.\n\n\"We hogged the ball the whole game,\" Cougars coach Mike Leach said. \"But I thought we could have capitalized on more stuff.\"\n\n\"Our defense was getting them off the field really fast, so hats off to them for getting us the ball,\" Minshew said.\n\nWashington State led just 10-7 at the break but linebacker Jahad Woods forced and recovered Travon McMillian's fumble at the Colorado 32 on the second play of the second half and Minshew threw a 1-yard dart to Renard Bell, sparking a 21-0 run that finally buried the Buffs.\n\nMinshew, who was hardly pressured all afternoon as Colorado failed to register a single sack for the first time all season, finished 35-of-58 passing for 335 yards and two TDs.\n\n\"I was off a little bit but I feel like we figured it out in the second half,\" said Minshew, who made it 24-7 on a 10-yard scramble in the fourth quarter on a drive was kept alive when Buffs safety Aaron Maddox was flagged for taunting Easop Winston on a key third down stop.\n\nInstead of fourth-and-9, it was first-and-10.\n\n\"That was all on me,\" Maddox said. \"I promise you that won't happen again.\"\n\nIn the first half, Minshew didn't look anything like the nation's leading passer that he is.\n\nAfter having to burn a timeout before the first snap of the game and another one before the first quarter ended with Washington State still scoreless, the Cougars finally got on the board with a 39-yard field goal.\n\nThey caught a huge break when linebacker Nate Landman, the Buffs' leading tackler, was ejected for targeting after stuffing Minshew for no gain on a second-and-1 keeper in the second quarter. Minshew ran around his left tackle and was ducking when Landman hit him.\n\n\"It was a good hit,\" Minshew said. \"But it was a penalty. We're trying to keep players safe and that's what we're doing is throwing a flag when that happens.\"\n\n\"Losing Nate's a tough blow,\" Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre said. \"Some of the mistakes we had underneath, he would have made\" those plays.\n\nWithout Landman, who was also ejected Oct. 6 against Arizona State, the Buffs couldn't stop the Cougars from taking a 10-7 halftime lead on running back Max Borghi's 28-yard catch and run .\n\nDespite their defense holding an opponent scoreless in the first quarter for the fifth straight game , the Buffs didn't capitalize as much as they could have. They only crossed midfield once in their seven first-half possessions, and that came on McMillian's 64-yard scamper to the 3. He ran it in on the next play for a 7-0 lead.\n\nColorado QB Steven Montez threw for just 67 yards in the first half and finished 20 of 35 for 199 yards and no touchdowns.\n\n\"It's a huge win, any win on the road in our conference is hard,\" Leach said. \"It's hard going down the path of real quality opponents. In this conference we don't really have any below average opponents they are all above average opponents. This is a huge win for us.\"\n\nSHAKING THE RUST\n\nShenault, who had 11 touchdowns during the Buffs' 5-0 start, was rusty in his return from a right turf toe injury. He caught 10 passes for 102 yards but cost his team dearly with back-to-back drops and a lost fumble.\n\n\"I was pretty close\" to 100 percent, Shenault said. \"I'm feeling fine.\"\n\nThe Cougars didn't act at all concerned about Laviska's return.\n\n\"Who's that? No. 2?\" Washington State defensive lineman Logan Tago said. \"Sorry.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY:\n\nWashington State: The Cougars took their time burying the Buffaloes, but in the end, it was a solid rout thanks to their great defense and stout offensive line that kept Minshew's jersey laundry-fresh.\n\nColorado: Not even the return of Shenault could kick-start the Buffs, who were still missing wide receivers Jay MacIntyre (concussion) and K.D. Nixon (hip). \"They both would have made a big difference for us today,\" Mike MacIntyre said. \"There were some balls not caught over the middle that should have been.\"\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Cougars should stay in the top 10 with the Pac-12 title in their sights, and they're still the conference's last hope for a College Football Playoff berth.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWashington State: Hosts Arizona on Saturday.\n\nColorado: Hosts Utah on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Bobcats were called for a defensive delay of game to give UNC one first down, then they were hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty by their head coach Jeff Choate.

Tennessee won 24-7. (AP Photo/Wade Payne) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee spoiled this Kentucky team's streak-busting reputation and maintained its home domination of the rivalry.\n\nJarrett Guarantano threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Callaway on the final play of the first half and Darrell Taylor recorded four sacks as Tennessee trounced No. 12 Kentucky 24-7 on Saturday. Tennessee has won its last 17 home games against Kentucky, which hasn't beaten the Volunteers at Neyland Stadium since 1984.\n\n\"I think the whole team felt very confident going into this game,\" Guarantano said. \"I know we were struggling last week (a 14-3 victory over Charlotte), but this week was different.\"\n\nTennessee (5-5, 2-4 SEC) has reason to feel confident whenever it hosts Kentucky (7-3, 5-3, No. 11 College Football Playoff).\n\nKentucky had ended one long run of futility earlier this season when it won 27-16 at Florida to snap a 31-game skid in that series. But the Wildcats couldn't reverse their history of frustration in Knoxville.\n\n\"I didn't know nothing about the streak until yesterday,\" Kentucky defensive end/outside linebacker Josh Allen said. \"I wasn't worried about no streak. I was worried about getting our next win and just go from there.\"\n\nTennessee broke the game open by scoring two touchdowns in the last three minutes of the second quarter.\n\nAfter Tim Jordan's 3-yard TD run gave Tennessee a 10-0 lead with 2:56 left before halftime, the Vols forced a punt and got the ball back at their own 28-yard line with a minute remaining.\n\nTennessee initially appeared intent on running out the clock, but the Vols called a timeout after Ty Chandler's 14-yard carry with 13 seconds left. Guarantano threw a 17-yard completion to Callaway that put Tennessee on Kentucky's 39 with 6 seconds remaining.\n\nRather than trying a short, quick pass to set up a long field-goal attempt, Guarantano threw deep. Callaway was at the front of a crowd in the right side of the end zone when he snared the ball to give Tennessee a 17-0 halftime advantage.\n\n\"We were a little bit out of field-goal range, so we took a shot in the end zone,\" Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \"I thought Jarrett did a good job evading a little bit of rush there, stepped up in the pocket and made a good throw to give us a chance, and Marquez went up and got it.\"\n\nGuarantano went 12 of 20 for 197 yards, including a 2-yard touchdown pass to Dominick Wood-Anderson that extended Tennessee's advantage to 24-0 in the third quarter. That lead proved insurmountable against a dispirited Kentucky squad.\n\nKentucky's hopes for its first SEC championship game appearance had disappeared with a 34-17 loss to No. 5 Georgia (No. 5 CFP) last week, but the Wildcats still were in position for a potential New Year's Six bowl appearance if they had won their final three-regular season games.\n\nThe Wildcats now likely must settle for a less prestigious bowl. Tennessee is one victory away from bowl eligibility after going winless in SEC competition last year.\n\n\"I thought we were very prepared going into the game, but it showed on the field that we weren't,\" Kentucky tight end C.J. Conrad said. \"They were more hungry than us tonight for whatever reason.\"\n\nKentucky's only points came on Terry Wilson's 19-yard touchdown pass to Conrad with 1:56 left in the third quarter.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats have relied on Benny Snell Jr.'s running ability and their defense's tenacity all year, but it appears both are wearing down late in the season. Snell, who entered Saturday as the SEC rushing leader, ran for 81 yards on 20 carries but was held below 100 yards rushing for a third straight game. He also had six catches for 25 yards. Kentucky headed into the Georgia game having not allowed any opponents to exceed 20 points all season. Now the Wildcats have given up at least 24 points in back-to-back weeks.\n\nTennessee: The return of safety Micah Abernathy and Chandler made a difference. Abernathy was back after missing four games with an ankle injury and had seven tackles. Nagging injuries limited Chandler to two carries last week, but he ran 16 times for 89 yards Saturday. After running for just 20 yards on 26 carries against Charlotte, Tennessee rushed 40 times for 215 yards against Kentucky.\n\nOFFICIAL'S INJURY\n\nChris Snead, a center judge on the officiating crew, was helped off the field and taken to an ambulance during the third quarter. SEC officials said after the game that Snead was taken to a hospital for evaluation.\n\nPENALIZING EVERYONE\n\nA skirmish in the end zone after Jordan's touchdown resulted in unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for every player on both teams. This marked the second straight season that a Tennessee-Kentucky game included an incident that resulted in penalties for every player on the field.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nKentucky should fall out of the top 15 and could sink as far as the 20s, though it likely will stay in the Top 25.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nAll seven of Taylor's sacks this season have come in two games. He had four sacks Saturday and had three in a 38-12 loss to Georgia on Sept. 29. ... Guarantano has thrown 146 consecutive passes without an interception. That breaks a school record formerly held by Casey Clausen, who threw 143 straight passes without getting picked off in 2003.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKentucky hosts Middle Tennessee.\n\nTennessee hosts Missouri.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
