["Errol Louis is the host of \"Inside City Hall,\" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) It's not your imagination: President Trump, who regularly makes a point of personally insulting public figures who challenge or displease him in any way, taps into an especially toxic well of vitriol when aiming his attacks at black Americans.\n\nThis week alone, Trump berated CNN correspondent Abby Phillip (\"What a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.\") He said of April Ryan , a reporter and CNN contributor who has covered the White House for 21 years: \"You talk about somebody that's a loser. She doesn't know what the hell she's doing.\"\n\nAnd at a post-election press conference, when Yamiche Alcindor of \"PBS NewsHour\" began to ask about accusations that his rhetoric may have emboldened violent white nationalist groups, Trump interrupted with, \"I don't know why you say that. That is such a racist question.\"\n\nThe three women -- all of them gifted, accomplished professionals -- will be covering politics long after Trump has left the White House. They join a long list of athletes, entertainers, journalists and politicians who Trump routinely attacks as \"dumb,\" \"not qualified\" or some such insult.\n\nNone of this is subtle or secret; that would defeat the purpose. For Trump, loudly and publicly denigrating black figures is the whole point.\n\nHe is a classic example of a backlash politician: a leader who exploits real or perceived white anxieties by exhibiting a flamboyant hostility to the political and economic demands of black Americans. We've had a string of such politicians since the civil rights movement, and that is neither surprising nor coincidental: Like many social revolutions, America's expansion of civil rights in the 1960s and '70s gave rise to a potent counterrevolution.\n\nWe saw it in Ronald Reagan's decision to launch his 1980 campaign for president at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where an infamous triple murder of civil rights organizers had occurred in 1964. Reagan didn't mention the martyred civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner or James Chaney in his speech, which was all about state's rights.\n\nAs columnist Bob Herbert later noted: \"Everybody watching the 1980 campaign knew what Reagan was signaling at the fair. Whites and blacks, Democrats and Republicans \u2014 they all knew. The news media knew. The race haters and the people appalled by racial hatred knew. And Reagan knew. He was tapping out the code.\"\n\nCandidate Reagan, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, went on to become President Reagan, who tried to weaken the Voting Rights Act and fought against making the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. a federal holiday.\n\nTrump knows the code. The prelude to his presidential run was his gleeful hyping of birtherism, a multiyear campaign of conspiracy theories and obvious lies that served no purpose beyond calling into question the legitimacy of Barack Obama's presidency.\n\nTrump has never renounced, or even acknowledged, the obvious racism of his birther falsehoods, and he never will. Birtherism -- like talking about state's rights in Mississippi -- was a quick, convenient way to attract people ready to push back against black advancement.\n\n\"There was a shocking amount of resentment that a black family had been in the White House for two terms. I think it would be naive to overlook it \u2014 the irony that one of the legacies of Obama's presidency was an enormous amount of resentment,\" Harvard historian Henry Louis Gates said after the 2016 election. \"I don't think a Donald Trump could have emerged without a black president. Donald Trump tapped into and fueled and stoked an enormous amount of racial resentment. And Obama symbolized it.\"\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWith Obama no longer in the public spotlight, Trump has to play backlash politics with whatever black targets of opportunity happen to be around. That is why he never misses a chance to attack Rep. Maxine Waters, Don Lemon of CNN or the black reporters in the White House press corps.\n\nIt's a disgusting and dangerous business: April Ryan has been subjected to death threats in the wake of Trump's verbal attacks. One can only hope the fever breaks soon, with the public signaling to political leaders that dividing and denigrating people is no way to lead a great nation.", "(CNN) Here is a look at the life of tennis champion and activist Billie Jean King.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: November 22, 1943\n\nBirth place: Long Beach, California\n\nBirth name: Billie Jean Moffitt\n\nFather: Willard J.

one percent (0.5%), a machine recount will commence.\n\nBarring lawsuits, delays, and local issues that could lengthen the process, here's a quick breakdown of what to expect over the next week and a half.\n\nMachine recount\n\nCounties can now begin to re-feed ballots into county or central count tabulators for the mandated machine recount. This process must be completed in all 67 counties by 3 p.m. on November 15, when the re-tabulated results are due back to the secretary of state. The results are known as the \"Second Unofficial Returns.\"\n\nManual recount\n\nIf after the machine recount the results from any of these races has a margin of 0.25% or less, a hand recount will be ordered for undervotes and overvotes only - not the entire 8.1 million plus votes that have been cast.\n\nThe Florida Secretary of State's office defines undervotes as \"no choice or fewer than the number of allowable choices in the recounted race(s) on their ballot.\" Essentially, a voter didn't pick someone for every race. The secretary defines overvotes as a voter who \"designated more choices than allowable in recounted race(s) on their ballot\" -- meaning a voter chose more than one candidate in a race.\n\nUndervotes and overvotes are not included in the machine recount and are only checked if the race moves on to the manual recount.\n\nWhat's left?\n\nThere are still more ballots on the way possibly. Overseas military and civilian ballots are due by November 16. All overseas ballots postmarked and signed by Election Day are considered valid.\n\nOnce all returns are in, the county canvassing boards must certify the results and submit them to the secretary of state by noon on November 18.\n\nFollowing the submission from the counties, the Election Canvassing Commission will meet to certify the results on Tuesday, at 9 a.m. on November 20. The commission includes the governor and two of his cabinet members. They will certify the results.\n\nThis is still Florida though, so don't forget another critical deadline on November 30 -- all lawsuits by candidates or civilians are due in circuit court.\n\nAvoiding a recount\n\nDon't hold your breath. Both sides seem to be in for the long haul.\n\nThere are two ways to avoid a recount. First, if a candidate submits a request in writing to not conduct it at any point during the process, the state will no longer be required to finish the re-tabulation.\n\nThere is one other out -- if the number of ballots to be counted (undervotes plus overvotes) is less than the margin between the two candidates, a manual recount is no longer required since it would be mathematically impossible to change the outcome of the election.\n\nAssuming the candidates don't back down and the margins stays close, any of these races could be challenged well into December.", "(CNN) Democrat Andrew Gillum withdrew his concession to Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis in the Florida governor's race on Saturday, hours after the secretary of state announced a recount of their race and two others.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\" he said with the recount now underway.\n\nGillum on Tuesday evening had told tearful supporters in Tallahassee, \"We recognize that we didn't win this tonight.\"\n\nBut on Saturday, he surprised just about everyone by announcing he would -- in what so far seems to be a mostly symbolic gesture -- change course and wait for more information. An attorney for Gillum told reporters the campaign was not alleging any wrongdoing and had no immediate plans to pursue legal action.\n\nExplaining his decision, Gillum said, \"We've learned in various parts of this state that there are still votes that are outstanding. There's even still in parts of this state some uncertainty around the total number of votes that are remaining to be cast.\"\n\nRead More", "\u0628\u0639\u062f \u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0646\u0632\u0648\u062d \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u062a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0643\u0648\u0646\u0629 \u0645\u0646 15 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0645 6 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u064a\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0635\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u0632\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u062d\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0642\u0627\u062f\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u0631 \u0647\u0631\u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0626\u064a \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0645\u062a\u0639\u062f\u062f\u0629\u060c \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062e\u0641\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0623\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0625\u0630 \u062a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u0623\u0631\u0636\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0631\u0649 \u0636\u0648\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0633 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u064a \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0623\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0638\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u063a\u0627\u062b\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0648\u0636\u0627\u0639\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0632\u0631\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0638\u0644 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0645\u0631\u0636\u0649.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u060c 10 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "(CNN) Vitamin D and omega-3 supplements do not prevent cancer or heart disease, a new study finds, the latest in the years-long debate over their benefits.\n\nThe trial enrolled more than 25,000 Americans of various ethnicities who were over the age of 50 and had no history of cancer, heart attack, stroke or other forms of heart disease.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned a daily dose of vitamin D, omega-3 or a placebo. After more than five years, no significant heart disease or cancer difference was seen between those taking supplements and those taking a placebo.\n\nLead researcher Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medincine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the study distinguishes itself because it is the world's largest randomized trial of its kind.\n\nPrevious research has looked at bone health or used high-risk populations, she added, but her study had the \"the primary aims to look if vitamin D and omega-3 could reduce risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease\" in typical people with no history of such conditions.\n\nThe results of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL -- known as VITAL -- were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2018 in Chicago and published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nVITAL's initial trial took place last year and included more than 8,000 participants.\n\nResearch has suggested that the fatty acid omega-3 could prevent cancers and cardiovascular diseases, the study says, and vitamin D has been suggested to reduce cancer risks because there are fewer cancer cases in countries with high sun exposure. Such observational studies are susceptible to confounding factors for a lower cancer rate in places where there is greater sun exposure, because people who spend more time outside are most likely also engaging in other healthy habits such as exercise.\n\n\"If you're already taking one or both of these supplements, there's no clear reason to stop. If you want to consider starting, our recommendation is to talk with your health care provider, but this does not need to be done on an urgent basis,\" Manson said.\n\nLittle protection from vitamin D\n\nThe study was a large clinical randomized trial, noted Brian Power, honorary senior dietitian at University College London Hospital and lecturer in nutrition who was not involved in the research. He described it in an email as \"the gold standard for evaluating effectiveness of interventions of this sort; bias and confounding are reduced.\"\n\nLooking at moderate to high dosages of 2,000 IU of vitamin D, 1,617 people developed cancer; of these, 793 were regular vitamin D takers, and 824 were in the placebo group.\n\nAlso, 905 participants developed major cardiovascular events such as stroke, heart attack or death from cardiovascular disease. Of them, 396 were taking vitamin D supplements daily; the placebo group had 409 cases of a major cardiovascular event.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the difference is too small and says there is no link between vitamin D and a lowered risk of major cardiovascular events or invasive cancers.\n\nAnastasia Z. Kalea, senior lecturer at the Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics at University College London who was not part of the study, said the results are \"very important but not surprising.\" Both conclusions were suspected, and the trial supports them, she added.\n\nThe study shows that it is not possible for vitamin D supplements to prevent cancer, and the differences in the placebo and vitamin D groups are minimal, Kalea said.\n\nHowever, over the course of the study, deaths from cancer were significantly reduced, by 25% for those who took vitamin D supplements. This finding needs further research, but Manson thinks it can be explained with vitamin D affecting tumor biology, making it less likely that the tumor grows and spreads.\n\nRecent research also disproved the theory that vitamin D improves bone health and prevents fractures, but some experts disagree with this, citing small time periods and sample sizes as well as insufficient dosages.\n\nSome benefit from omega-3\n\nIn the omega-3 analysis, invasive cancers were found in 820 participants taking daily supplements of 1 gram of omega-3 and in 797 who received a placebo.\n\nAlso, 386 people taking 1 gram of omega-3 experienced cardiovascular events during the study, as did 419 people taking a placebo.\n\nBut for heart attacks specifically, findings showed an overall 28% reduction in those taking omega-3 supplements. For African-Americans, the study found a 77% reduction in heart attacks linked to daily of omega-3 supplements.\n\nIn people who don't eat the recommended one or two servings of fish a week, the supplements were linked to a 40% reduction in heart attacks. But for people who followed the recommendation, there was no such association.\n\nManson recommends trying to get omega-3 from a healthy diet that incorporates fish. But people who don't eat or don't like fish should talk to a health care professional about the option of omega-3 supplements.\n\n\"It could be a chance finding,\" Manson said, and thus it needs to be replicated. But if confirmed this could point to a \"promising approach to reducing health disparity.\"\n\nNathan Davies, lead for the Clinical Nutrition and Public Health program at University College London, said these findings are not \"radical findings by any means. There could be benefits there, but they are not as clear-cut.\"\n\nThe findings show that omega-3 oils are not harmful, added Davies, who was not involved in the research.\n\nHowever, he noted that the study could have benefited from longer duration. \"You always want an even longer duration, especially if you are looking at cancer.\"\n\nIt also doesn't analyze whether there is a dose dependency effect and a higher dose could lead to better results, Davies said.\n\n\"Diet is more important than supplementation. If you have a good diet, you won't need supplements,\" he said, adding that this is not always practical, as factors such as income and availability can also affect diet.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nVictoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, wrote in an email, \"We don't recommend taking vitamin and mineral supplements to prevent heart and circulatory disease, and this study's findings support our advice.\n\n\"If you eat a healthy, balanced Mediterranean style diet, you should be able to get all the nutrients that you need to protect you from heart and circulatory diseases,\" she added.", "(CNN) A move by the Philippines Justice Department to charge investigative news site Rappler with tax evasion is being seen as a thinly disguised attempt to stifle press freedom in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nOn Friday, the Justice Department said it had \"found probable cause\" to indict Rappler and its CEO and executive editor, former CNN bureau chief Maria Ressa , on charges of tax evasion.\n\n\"We are not at all surprised by the decision, considering how the Duterte administration has been treating Rappler for its independent and fearless reporting,\" Rappler said in statement.\n\nOfficials said Rappler and Ressa failed to declare about $3 million in 2015 on tax returns from an investment by the Omidyar Network, a fund created by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.\n\nThe investment was touted by Rappler in November 2015 as a partnership that created \"an 'inclusive media' platform that blends professional journalism, technology and the wisdom of the crowd.\n\nMaria Ressa speaks to the media as she arrives at the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) headquarters in Manila on January 22, 2018.\n\nRappler has not shied away from critical reporting about Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, closely documenting his so-called \"war on drugs,\" a widespread crackdown which has been condemned for encouraging thousands of extrajudicial killings.\n\nIn January, the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily revoked Rappler's registration on the basis that it had violated the country's constitution over foreign ownership rules.\n\nAt the time, Ressa said: \"We need to continue. What we say at Rappler is, 'we going to hold the line.' We're not doing anything but journalism. We're speaking truth to power. That's what we do.\"\n\nA spokesman for Duterte told CNN Philippines earlier this year that the President had \"nothing to do with the SEC decision.\"\n\nAwarded for 'intrepid' reporting\n\nThe day before Friday's announcement of tax evasion charges, Ressa was in the US to accept a Knight International Journalism Award from the International Committee for Journalists (ICFJ).\n\nIn a statement announcing the award, the ICFJ lauded Ressa as an \"intrepid editor and media innovator who holds a spotlight to the Philippine government's bloody war on drugs.\"\n\nRessa said that Duterte was using the same tactics that were now being seen in the US, including the banning of journalists and labeling of critical stories as \"fake news.\"\n\n\"Our problems are fast becoming your problems. Boundaries around the world have collapsed,\" she said, according to an ICFJ statement dated November 9.\n\nInternet freedom declining\n\nFreedom House , a US government-funded NGO, released a report earlier this month found that internet freedom had declined worldwide for the eighth consecutive year.\n\nOf 65 countries examined, the Philippines suffered one of the biggest drops in a point-scoring method that assesses internet access, freedom of expression, and privacy issues, according to the report \"Freedom on the Net.\"\n\nThe report now categorizes the country as \"Partly Free,\" partly due to the \"harassment of dissenting voices.\"\n\n\"Rappler was a frequent target with at least two libel charges filed related to the outlet's critical reporting of government officials and powerful business people,\" the report said in its section on the Philippines\n\nEarlier this year, leading human rights activists urged the government to stop attempts to shut down Rappler.\n\n\"Rappler's work rests on its own freedom to impart information, and more importantly its vast readership to have access to its public interest reporting,\" said the statement, signed by David Kaye, Michel Forst and Agnes Callamard.\n\nCallamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, has herself been verbally attacked by Duterte who called her a \"fool\" and threatened to \"slap\" her if she persisted in investigating the war on drugs.

Sin embargo, es casi imposible para las mujeres probar que no distribuyeron o enviaron im\u00e1genes por s\u00ed mismas.\n\nPero cuando se le pregunt\u00f3 c\u00f3mo se aplicar\u00eda eso en el caso de Heard, Kezaabu sugiri\u00f3 que ella hab\u00eda publicado las fotos de desnudos ella misma.\n\nMientras tanto, Heard contin\u00faa. \"Cuando las fotos volvieron este a\u00f1o, pens\u00e9 que mi vida iba a terminar\", dijo. \"Pero eleg\u00ed ser fuerte y enfrentar al mundo\".", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

been selling hard-to-find electronics online. At one point, Apple products made up half of AceBeach's business, but in recent years Apple has made it increasingly difficult for third-parties to sell used or new iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.\n\nA new deal between Apple and Amazon is about to make it even harder. It could be the final blow for many small online resale and repair shops.\n\nAmazon and Apple have stuck an agreement that lets Amazon list the newest Apple and Beats products when they come out, like the iPhone XS and XR. In exchange, Amazon will remove any non-authorized third-party sellers selling Apple products from the platform. The deal will begin later this year and apply to Amazon sales in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, India, France, Germany and Spain.\n\nAmazon will sell and ship Apple products, which it will get directly from Apple. It will also list products from some approved Apple resellers.\n\nSellers found out about the change Friday morning in a letter from Amazon, obtained by CNN Business. They have until January 4, 2019 to sell their existing products before Amazon removes all of their listings. Amazon recommended they contact Apple if they'd like to become an authorized reseller and continue selling products on its site.\n\n\"It's just [an] assault on 3rd party resellers,\" said the owner of AceBeach, who asked not to be identified. \"They just want it so people like me will have to go through Apple directly.\"\n\nApproved Apple resellers have to buy a minimum amount of Apple product a year, which doesn't make sense for some smaller sellers. Many do most of their sales immediately after an Apple product release in March and September, when inventory can be scarce. The third-parties often stock up on the new devices the day they're released at Apple Stores and Best Buy, and rush to fill the void on Amazon. They call it \"Apple Season.\"\n\nOther small businesses deal in used and refurbished devices, buying them from their original owners and fixing them up. These companies will also have to be approved by Apple, which likely means they will have to become authorized Apple service providers as well. As part of that program, people who fix phones have to have a commercial space where customers can walk-in, and they can only use official Apple parts.\n\nUnauthorized companies are still able to sell Apple goods on sites like Ebay and Craigslist, or through their own sites, but that business is a fraction of what they can do on Amazon. In addition to the higher volume, Amazon offers sellers more protection from fraud.\n\nAmazon dominates online retail in the United States, dwarfing even its closest competitors. It accounts for 49.1% of all US online retail sales, according to eMarketer , and is expected to bring in $258.22 billion in sales this year.\n\nIt is trailed by eBay, which is in second place with 6.6% of sales. Apple is the third largest e-commerce site in the US with 3.9% of sales. That may sound tiny compared to Amazon, but it's impressive when you consider Apple is selling a very limited selection of products.\n\n\"Amazon is constantly working to enhance the customer experience, and one of the ways we do this is by increasing selection of the products we know customers want,\" Amazon said in a statement about the change.\n\nThis isn't the first time Amazon has worked with retailers to crack down on third-party sellers. When AceBeach was selling some popular toys, Amazon started requiring documentation from manufacturers like Hasbro giving permission to sell their products, said AceBeach's owner.\n\nA 2013 Supreme Court ruling upheld the right of people to resell any items they have purchased legally, even if they are copyrighted. But as a business, Amazon has full control over who can sell what on its platform.\n\nSometimes it uses that power against its biggest competitors. Amazon has blocked the sale of Google devices like the Chromecast that compete with its own smart speakers and streaming devices.

close look at surveillance video it says shows a suspect.\n\nSomeone drove away with 13-year-old Hania Aguilar in an SUV that had been idling outside her Lumberton home Monday morning before school, authorities said, prompting police to issue an Amber Alert for her.\n\nThe stolen SUV was found abandoned Thursday morning less than 10 miles from Hania's home at the Rosewood Mobile Home Park, authorities said.\n\nA reward for information that leads to her has risen to $20,000, Lumberton police Chief Michael McNeill said Friday.\n\nThe FBI has asked the public to examine video it says shows a man walking near Hania's home.\n\nIt said the man, wearing light-colored shoes, a light-colored shirt, and a hoodie, was walking south on Lambert Street, then turned north on North Carolina Highway 41/Elizabethtown Highway toward the mobile home park.\n\n\"Someone knows this man, and we need you to call us,\" FBI supervisory resident agent Andy de la Rocha said Friday. \"Maybe you recognize the way he walks, his mannerisms, or maybe he will recognize himself on TV.\"\n\n\"The public was critical in the recovery of the SUV. Now we need you to come through again for us. Who is the man on the video?\" he asked.\n\nWhat happened\n\nOn Monday, a Spanish-speaking woman and man told a 911 operator that a man stole the SUV, which had been left running, with a child inside, according to a CNN translation.\n\nThe FBI, after talking with people at the mobile home park, described the girl's abduction this way: \"A witness saw a male subject dressed in all black and wearing a yellow bandana force Hania into a relative's vehicle that was parked in the driveway.\"\n\nA reward for information about Hania has risen to $20,000.\n\nHania is Hispanic, about 5 feet tall and 125 pounds. She has black hair and brown eyes, and was last seen wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt with flowers, according to the FBI , which is investigating the case with the Lumberton police.\n\nAuthorities have no reason to think Hania knew her abductor, they said Wednesday afternoon. The girl's family is cooperating with the investigation, they said.\n\nLumberton is in southeastern North Carolina, near Interstate 95, and is about 95 miles from Raleigh.", "Washington (CNN) Armed with the power to set the agenda and, if needed, issue subpoenas, House Democrats plan to ramp up the pressure on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo following the midterm elections as they seek substantive answers related to the Trump administration's handling of foreign policy and national security issues.\n\nPompeo, who made his mark on the House select investigative committee probing the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, has frustrated many of his former colleagues on both sides of the aisle during his time as Secretary of State by \"stonewalling\" requests for information on the administration's policies.\n\n\"If he was treated the way we feel like we are being treated, he would rant and rave,\" New York Democrat and the likely incoming chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Eliot Engel told CNN.\n\n\"He came to our committee once, stayed for about four hours ... several months later, he appeared before the Senate but did not appear before the House. That was a snub any way you want to look at it,\" he said.\n\nPompeo said \"all the right things\" during his first, and only, appearance before the committee in May, according to Engel, but the State Department as a whole has been slow to respond and dismissive of issues lawmakers have raised in numerous letters on various topics since, a Congressional aide told CNN.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump has defiantly vowed to adopt a \"warlike posture\" should he face a barrage of investigations from House Democrats, Pompeo can be sure to expect a request to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the near future, according to Engel, who said he plans to make it very clear that he expects the top US diplomat to work with lawmakers rather than keeping them in the dark.\n\n\"I'm hoping that perhaps, because he was member of the House, that he realizes what his own frustrations were from time to time and that he will understand that we don't want to be stonewalled, Engel said, adding that if Pompeo is resistant then lawmakers will \"find other ways to get to the truth.\"\n\n\"Since he was a House member, I would think he would understand or should understand, the fact that we are ... entitled to get the truth,\" he said. \"I hope the Republicans on our committee would be just as vocal as we would be about being treated as a co-equal branch of government and not subservient to the White House.\"\n\nEngel told CNN that he plans to immediately begin probing a laundry list of issues including the White House's dealings with Russia, Trump's foreign business dealings and claims of unethical behavior within the State Department.\n\nThe priorities for Democrats on the Foreign Affairs committee fall into two buckets, according to a Democratic Congressional aide: One being oversight of relevant agencies within the committees' jurisdiction and the other investigating \"the President's conflicts of interests, including possible foreign entanglements in his business dealings.\n\n\"We are going to get a lot more transparency on the President's conflicts of interests ... where he is involved, invested. Our question: Have any personal interests had any effect on foreign policy making?\" the aide said.\n\nSpecifically, Democrats want answers related to administration's policy decisions on Russia, including details as to what was discussed during Trump's meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and additional information on Moscow's interference in US elections.\n\nLawmakers want to determine an appropriate response to Russian election interference and establish a deterrent to prevent meddling going forward, the aide told CNN.\n\nThey plan to use the majority to investigate issues like claims of a politically motivated purge at the State Department, according to the aide.\n\nThe aide told CNN that it would \"be an error to jump headlong\" and issue subpoenas but the new chairman would consider whatever option he needs to in order to get the information needed.\n\nThe Trump administration's lack of transparency on the North Korea situation has also been a major cause of frustration for Democrats on the committee who feel they have been \"kept out of the loop\" in a process that should involve Congress, according to the aide.\n\nGetting information related to the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is also a priority for both US lawmakers who want to know what actually happened, who is responsible and what drove the administration's response or lack of there of.\n\nForeign diplomats also expect Congress to return with Democrats having renewed energy to hit the administration hard on issues that also matter greatly to US allies and where there has been concern that there will be foot-dragging, including on a response to Khashoggi's murder and Russian sanctions, two senior diplomatic sources told CNN.\n\n\"This is a promising sign that House Democrats will speak with a stronger voice, meaning much stronger pressure on the administration to act on things like Khashoggi. We look forward to it,\" one senior diplomatic source said.\n\nStill, it remains to be seen how Pompeo will respond.\n\nDuring a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, he clashed with both Republicans and Democrats on several occasions -- refusing to provide substantive details about Trump's one-on-one meeting with Putin in Helsinki and the state of talks with North Korea following the President's sitdown with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.\n\nPompeo ardently defended the administration's policies throughout the three-hour long hearing but would not provide a clear answer to questions about the President's conversation with Putin nor disclose what commitments on denuclearization Kim made to Trump during their summit.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on whether he will comply with any future request to testify before the House Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nEven if he does make an appearance on Capitol Hill, Engel admits that he does not have a \"magic wand\" that can compel the Secretary of State to cooperate, but said he does plan to make his expectations very clear.\n\n\"My attitude is going to be, we are going to be reasonable, ask for reasonable things and we are going to hope we are treated in a reasonable fashion. If we are, I think that there will be progress made, and I don't shy away from that. But if he doesn't we are not going to just accept it,\" Engel told CNN.\n\n\"Respect is a two-way street,\" he said.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Las fuertes lluvias que caen sobre Buenos Aires, capital de Argentina, obligaron a la suspensi\u00f3n del encuentro entre Boca Juniors y River Plate, por el primer partido de la final de la Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica, inform\u00f3 la Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol (Conmebol).\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 \u00a1A esperar un d\u00eda m\u00e1s para la gran final de la #CONMEBOLLibertadores! \ud83d\udd1c @BocaJrsOficial y @CARPoficial jugar\u00e1n este domingo. pic.twitter.com/xbAfQUQ9iD \u2014 CONMEBOL Libertadores (@Libertadores) November 10, 2018\n\n\"Por motivos de fuerza mayor el partido queda suspendido para ma\u00f1ana, domingo 11 de noviembre a las 16:00 horas [hora argentina]\", detall\u00f3 la Conmebol en su cuenta oficial de Twitter.\n\nPor motivos de fuerza mayor el partido queda suspendido para ma\u00f1ana, domingo 11 de noviembre a las 16:00 h. \u2014 CONMEBOL.com (@CONMEBOL) November 10, 2018\n\nSeg\u00fan informa la agencia estatal T\u00e9lam, dirigentes de ambos equipos y de la Conmebol se reunir\u00e1n esta tarde para oficializar la nueva fecha.\n\nAsimismo, se inform\u00f3 que ni los jugadores de Boca Juniors ni los de River Plate llegaron al estadio, sino que permanecieron en sus respectivos locales de concentraci\u00f3n.\n\n1 de 9 | Una vista exterior del estadio de La Bombonera, en Buenos Aires, tras una lluvia torrencial.

Se las dimos a Arabia Saudita, a Estados Unidos, a los alemanes, a los franceses y a los ingleses, les dimos todas\".\n\nNo dio m\u00e1s detalles sobre lo que hab\u00eda en las grabaciones.\n\nLEE: Asesinato de Khashoggi fue una \"operaci\u00f3n malvada\" sin conocimiento del pr\u00edncipe heredero, dice Arabia Saudita\n\nErdogan dijo que el asesino, o asesinos, ser\u00eda conocido por los 18 sospechosos identificados por las autoridades turcas, incluidos 15 hombres que llegaron de Arabia Saudita poco antes de la muerte de Khashoggi.\n\nVolvi\u00f3 a pedir a Arabia Saudita que proporcione respuestas sobre lo que le sucedi\u00f3 a Khashoggi y su cuerpo, que a\u00fan no ha sido encontrado.\n\nErdogan ha exigido anteriormente que Arabia Saudita entregue a los 18 sospechosos para ser procesados \u200b\u200ben Turqu\u00eda, pero el reino ha insistido en que los responsables de la muerte de Khashoggi ser\u00e1n juzgados en Arabia Saudita.\n\nEl fiscal general de Turqu\u00eda dijo hace 10 d\u00edas que Khashoggi fue estrangulado tan pronto como ingres\u00f3 al consulado saud\u00ed, como parte de un plan premeditado, y que su cuerpo fue desmembrado.\n\nLa confirmaci\u00f3n de Erdogan de que las grabaciones relacionadas con la muerte de Khashoggi han sido entregadas a los pa\u00edses mencionados es la \u00faltima informaci\u00f3n publicada por Turqu\u00eda en las semanas posteriores a la desaparici\u00f3n del periodista.\n\nRevelaciones de la parte turca han ayudado a mantener la presi\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica sobre Arabia Saudita para explicar lo sucedido.\n\nLos saud\u00edes han presentado historias cambiantes sobre el destino del periodista, negando inicialmente cualquier conocimiento antes de asegurar que un grupo de trabajadores deshonestos, muchos de los cuales pertenecen al c\u00edrculo \u00edntimo del Pr\u00edncipe Mohammed bin Salman, fueron responsables de la muerte de Khashoggi. El fiscal general saud\u00ed reconoci\u00f3 que Khashoggi fue asesinado en un asesinato premeditado.\n\nRiad ha sostenido que ni bin Salman ni su padre, el rey Salman, sab\u00edan de la operaci\u00f3n para atacar a Khashoggi. Los funcionarios estadounidenses han dicho que una misi\u00f3n de este tipo, incluidos los 15 hombres enviados desde Riad, no podr\u00eda haberse llevado a cabo sin la autorizaci\u00f3n de Bin Salman, el gobernante de facto del pa\u00eds.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de que Arabia Saudita admiti\u00f3 que Khashoggi fue asesinado en su consulado de Estambul, cinco funcionarios de alto rango fueron despedidos, incluido el jefe de medios de bin Salman y el jefe adjunto del servicio de inteligencia saud\u00ed.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\nHistory shows that dramatic victories by the opposition party two years into a presidency don't guarantee anything. Presidents Clinton and Obama, for instance, were reelected after midterm shellackings. But they can create substantial opportunities to achieve partisan advantage.\n\nThis is the case with 2018.\n\nHouse Democrats can promote a robust issue agenda\n\nOne power that is afforded to the House majority centers on its ability to inject issues into national debate. This is the congressional bully pulpit.\n\nHouse Democrats may face some difficulty finding legislation that will make it through the Senate, where Senator Mitch McConnell is waiting like Darth Vader to kill any bills. But they can shift the media discussion from the daily chaos of the Trump White House by simply proposing legislation and triggering debate.\n\nThis is important since the midterms demonstrated that Democrats support issues that are popular with the public. These include protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions, Medicaid expansion, gun control, and voter rights. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a skilled veteran of Capitol Hill and probably the next Speaker, can keep these sorts of issues on the front burner, reminding voters what their party stands for and forcing Republicans to show what they are against.\n\nDemocratic governors can change politics within key states\n\nDemocrats were finally able to reverse some of the damage from the Obama years by winning gubernatorial races in Kansas, Michigan and Wisconsin, among others. These governors can play a pivotal role in the presidential campaign. They will have the capacity to push back against voter restrictions that have been put into place in recent years, which disproportionately impact voters who lean toward Democrats.\n\nGovernors also will be able to push for state policies that energize voters, and in turn generate ideas for a national candidate. Closer to election time, the Democratic governors can help mobilize their party behind the chosen candidate. A few of them might even emerge as potential candidates themselves.\n\nDemocrats learned that grass-roots mobilization matters\n\nWhen many Americans are cynical about the impact of average people, the midterms offered a template for how electoral success comes from the bottom up.\n\nFrom the minute the 2016 election ended, there was a surge of Democrats who were angry about the outcome and determined to do something about it. Hundreds of thousands of people participated in the Women's March on Washington and similar demonstrations around the country just one day after President Trump's inauguration. The march rallied those who felt defeated and energized a grass-roots movement.\n\nEducated women in suburbs dove into the grunt work of organizing and building local political networks to deliver the vote in the midterms, according to Theda Skocpol and Laura Putnam's surveys and interviews\n\nSome of these women didn't just prepare to vote. They ran for office and set a record in the House.\n\nSurvivors of February's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School also became fierce organizers. They may be frustrated with the possible outcomes in Florida, where two gun-rights candidates might win. But their activism boosted participation among younger voters and inspired older Americans to see why the composition of Congress matters. Gun control advocates also increased their numbers in Congress, and a sizable contingent of NRA-backed legislators won't be returning to the Hill\n\nThe local mobilization that occurred before the midterms can be the basis for Democrats to start preparing for 2020.\n\nCoalitional candidates are the best bet\n\nJUST WATCHED Should Dems bet on Beto? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Should Dems bet on Beto? 04:33\n\nThere has been endless head-scratching and debate among Democrats about whether the party should move to the left (towards newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example) or veer to the center (occupied by Connor Lamb and Doug Jones). Democrats should instead ask which candidates have the political savvy and charisma to build a big tent. Beto O'Rourke was one such contender, and his campaign showed the strength of that combination, even in a deeply conservative state like Texas.\n\nDemocrats are now competitive in a broader portion of the electorate as Trump has narrowed his party's appeal. They should search for someone who can put together an issues package and have the Beto-like appeal to attract a diverse voting body.\n\nDon't fret too much over the reddest states\n\nDemocrats are celebrating and breathing a sigh of relief over the House and state election outcomes, but the results in the Senate should be sobering. In October, Trump campaigned fiercely on issues like immigration and Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination, which seemed to resonate in Republican states. Whether it was Trump or loyalty to the GOP, voters in red areas supported the party line and were not open to very centrist candidates like Democrat Heidi Heitkamp, who was defeated in North Dakota.\n\nFor more opinion...

The midterms should prevent Democrats from making the mistake of thinking that they can flip states in most circumstances. Democrats should be realistic about Republican strongholds and see that putting their human and financial resources into fighting for purple states like Nevada and Colorado is the best investment.\n\nIt won't be long before the presidential campaign really begins. The candidates soon will announce their intent to run, the debates will begin, and the fundraising will kick off. Although this was not a total revolt against Trump, the midterms have provided Democrats with a massive opening to take back the White House in 2020.", "(CNN) Here is a look at the life of activist and seven-time Emmy Award winning actor Ed Asner.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: November 15, 1929\n\nBirth place: Kansas City, Missouri\n\nBirth name: Etye Asner\n\nFather: Morris David Asner, scrap metal dealer\n\nMother: Lizzie (Seliger) Asner\n\nMarriages: Cindy Gilmore (1998-2007, divorced); Nancy Sykes (1959-1988, divorced)\n\nChildren: With Carol Jean Vogelman: Charles; with Nancy Sykes: Kathryn; Mathew and Liza (twins)\n\nEducation: Attended the University of Chicago, 1947-1949\n\nMilitary: US Army Signal Corps\n\nOther Facts:\n\nNominated for 21 Emmy Awards, including 17 Nominated for 21 Emmy Awards, including 17 Primetime Emmys and four Daytime Emmys , and has won seven for primetime.\n\nOnly actor to win both a comedy and a drama Primetime Emmy for the same role, for \"Lou Grant.\"\n\nHe played Lou Grant on four different television series: \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" \"Rhoda,\" \"Lou Grant,\" and \"Roseanne.\"\n\nHas been outspoken about his opposition to war.\n\nHe is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America\n\nTimeline:\n\n1950s - Member of Chicago's Playwrights Theatre Club before moving to New York.\n\n1957 - Makes his television debut in the drama \"Studio One.\"\n\n1960 - Lands his first Broadway role in \"Face of a Hero\" with Jack Lemmon.\n\n1962 - Is cast in his first film role in Is cast in his first film role in Elvis Presley's \"Kid Galahad.\"\n\n1969 - Plays a small role as a police officer in Presley's film \"Change of Habit\" where he works with Plays a small role as a police officer in Presley's film \"Change of Habit\" where he works with Mary Tyler Moore for the first time.\n\nSeptember 19, 1970 - The first telecast of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" airs on CBS.

Or as England coach Eddie Jones put it in the build up, \"We want to direct the movie, not just be in it.\"\n\nFor 60 minutes, England was in the directors' chair courtesy of tries from Chris Ashton and Dylan Hartley, and but for a disallowed try at the end may well have pulled it off.\n\nBut part of the All Blacks' magic is poise and patience, and the double world champions hit back to escape with a 16-15 victory under the drizzle of southwest London.\n\nWith the World Cup less than a year away it was a significant result for both sides.\n\nFor New Zealand, it added to its reputation as one of sport's most dominant winning machines, and was, perhaps, proof that the recent defeat against South Africa was a blip.\n\nFor England, shorn of a raft of key players through injury, it was another step in the right direction following last week's win against South Africa in the wake of a disappointing year that has put Australia's Jones on the ropes.\n\n\"Sometimes the game loves you, sometimes it doesn't,\" said Jones, whose side got away with a controversial late decision which could have cost them the win against the Springboks.\n\n\"We really stuck it to them. It's a really good step forward because you benchmark yourself against New Zealand.\"\n\nThe All Blacks hadn't been to the home of English rugby for four years, but like the opening chords of a long-awaited Rolling Stones tour, the hair-raising haka told you they were back.\n\nNot that you could hear the warrior's chants, such was the deafening rendition of \"Swing low, sweet chariot,\" English rugby's anthem. The thunderous noise at Twickenham told you this was special.\n\nThe New Zealand All Blacks perform the haka ahead of the game against England at Twickenham.\n\nThe match was also billed as a clash of styles. The All Blacks' electric, attacking rugby -- yielding an average of four tries in its last 12 games -- against England's tighter, more forward oriented game.\n\nFrom the outset, Jones' men were muscular, fired up, and precise. They met the Kiwi rapier with a cutlass and cudgel.\n\nA flowing early move sent winger Ashton -- also back for the first time in four years -- over in the right corner.\n\nAs if on cue, the stadium PA pumped out the Stones' \"Start Me Up,\" and it was clear England had picked up the challenge of the haka and run with it.\n\nA second try followed, this time from a ferocious forward surge off a lineout to put co-captain Hartley over.\n\nAs England surged to a 15-0 lead it looked as if rugby's axis was in full tilt.\n\nEngland wing Chris Ashton scored the opening try against New Zealand at Twickenham.\n\nEngland push over Dylan Hartley to score against New Zealand.\n\n'Purring'\n\nBut like a wily hunter stalking its prey, New Zealand remained patient, prodding and probing.\n\nAnd when opportunity knocked the men in black struck with clinical precision.\n\nSlick handling in a pre-arranged backs move put full back Damian McKenzie under England's posts. Beauden Barrett added the conversion and landed a penalty shortly after to go in at the break 15-10 down but on the up.\n\nThe All Blacks' engine was purring again after half time, only for a rare dropped pass to scupper a certain try.\n\nUndeterred, England had a near miss of its own, but despite hammering away near the Kiwi line it couldn't quite find a way through.\n\nAs Jones admitted, those are the chances you must take against the All Blacks, because when Barrett slotted a drop-goal and then another penalty on the hour mark, New Zealand were suddenly in front.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, handed All Blacks captain Kieran Read the Hillary Shield.\n\n'Trust and belief'\n\nThe All Blacks are renowned for their ability to snuff out tiring opposition in the last quarter, but England hung on tight at Twickenham.\n\n\"New Zealand generally run away from teams in those areas but they couldn't,\" said Jones.\n\nWhen flanker Sam Underhill turned Barrett inside out and looked to have scored in the left corner off a charged down kick with five minutes left, the majority of the 80,000 crowd erupted with roars that reverberated down the nearby River Thames.\n\nBut the referee opted for a TV review and England lock Courtney Lawes was adjudged marginally offside in charging down the kick.\n\nAll Blacks' coach Steve Hansen claimed there was \"no doubt\" it was offside, but said later he was just worried the officials would be \"brave enough\" to make such a crucial decision.\n\n\"I thought England were very good, but I thought we showed a lot of character to be down 15-0 in a hostile environment, with 79,000 not being Kiwis, and the weather conditions -- it wasn't conducive to being able to play razzle-dazzle rugby -- and the boys stuck with it,\" said Hansen.\n\nNew Zealand captain Kieran Read added: \"For us it's about trust and belief. We just had to work things out.\"\n\nSam Underhill's late try for England was disallowed.\n\nAfter talking to reporters, Hansen set off to find his old mate Jones for a beer.\n\nThey'll have much to discuss over the next 12 months.\n\n\"It was a fantastic game of rugby,\" said Jones.\n\n\"I tell you, we're excited about where we're going.\"\n\nEngland takes on Japan next week, while New Zealand moves on to face Ireland in Dublin.", "(CNN) Here's a look at the life of Oscar-winning filmmaker Martin Scorsese.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: November 17, 1942\n\nBirth place: New York, New York\n\nBirth name: Martin Marcantonio Luciano Scorsese\n\nFather: Charles Scorsese, worked in the garment industry\n\nMother: Catherine (Cappa) Scorsese\n\nMarriages: Helen Morris (1999-present); Barbara De Fina (1985-1991, divorced); Isabella Rossellini (1979-1982, divorced); Julia Cameron (1975-1977, divorced); Laraine (Brennan) Scorsese (1965-unknown publicly, divorced)\n\nChildren: with Helen Morris: Francesa; with Julia Cameron: Domenica; with Laraine (Brennan) Scorsese: Catherine\n\nEducation: New York University, B.S., 1964, M.A., 1968\n\nOther Facts:\n\nSuffered from asthma and poor health as a child and spent most of his time at home or at the movies.\n\nGrew up in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan.\n\nRaised Roman Catholic, he planned to become a priest as a teen.

of \"America's Team\" are among those set to receive the highest honor that a president can bestow on a civilian.\n\nThe White House announced Saturday that President Donald Trump will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to seven people next week.

The guidelines were announced Saturday during the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference.\n\n\"High cholesterol treatment is not one size fits all, and this guideline strongly establishes the importance of personalized care,\" Dr. Michael Valentine, president of the American College of Cardiology, said in a press release\n\n\"Over the past five years, we've learned even more about new treatment options and which patients may benefit from them,\" he said. \"By providing a treatment roadmap for clinicians, we are giving them the tools to help their patients understand and manage their risk and live longer, healthier lives.\"\n\nCriticism of previous guidelines\n\nThe new recommendations address many of the concerns raised when the guidelines were last updated five years ago.\n\nThose 2013 guidelines were troublesome for a number of reasons, explained Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic: The previous guidelines used a risk calculator that left out crucial components such as family history; they didn't address the issue of people older than 75 or younger than 40; they overhyped the risks many patients faced while lowering the threshold needed to warrant statin drug therapy; and they did away with the use of LDL (bad) cholesterol target levels, which helped patients set meaningful goals.\n\nPeople with LDL levels of 100 or lower, \"tend to have lower rates of heart disease and stroke, supporting a 'lower is better' philosophy,\" according to a statement from the medical organizations about the new guidelines.\n\nA level of above 160 is considered \"very high,\" according to a release from Johns Hopkins Medicine , which also outlined the new guidelines. For high risk patients, the recommendation is to lower \"bad\" cholesterol to levels below 70.\n\nIf statin therapy fails to lower LDL levels adequately, in patients who've already had a heart attack or stroke, the new guidelines suggest adding other drugs -- ezetimibe, which is available as a generic -- to the regimen. If that combination doesn't work sufficiently for patients who are at a very high risk, a PCSK9 inhibitor can be added.\n\nThe new approach encourages increased collaboration between doctors and their patients. Doctors are encouraged to discuss a broad range of factors that may increase risks, such as family history and ethnicity, as well as other conditions including metabolic syndrome, premature menopause and chronic kidney disease.\n\nImpact of high cholesterol on all age groups\n\nDoctors are also being urged to look at the lifetime of patients and how high cholesterol takes a toll. Children born to especially high-risk families can be tested when they are as young as 2. For most children, though, the recommendation is to have an initial test between ages 9 and 11, and then a follow-up test between the ages of 17 and 21.\n\nAnd just as cholesterol levels in younger people shouldn't be ignored, the same goes for those over 75, the new recommendations say.\n\n\"They now acknowledge that it might be appropriate to treat older people,\" something they didn't do in 2013, said Nissen, who was highly critical of the last round of guidelines. \"Today's 75-year-old can live a long time.\"\n\nAll of these developments are good signs, \"a step forward,\" Nissen said. \"It took five years to fix the problems with the last set of guidelines, but I'm glad they've been addressed.\"\n\nNissen offered just one criticism of the new recommendations: the suggestion that coronary artery calcium scores be used to help determine the need for cholesterol-lowering treatments in patients for whom the need isn't clear. This score shows plaque buildup in arteries and is determined through a CT scan, he said.\n\nAt the Cleveland Clinic where he works, Nissen said a scan for a coronary artery calcium score costs less than $500, but the more thorough scan that includes angiography exceeds $1,000.\n\n\"You're radiating somebody in order to decide whether to use a drug that costs as little as $3 a month, and you're spending a lot of money to do it,\" he said. \"I just don't think it's prudent.\"\n\nThere are other cardiologists, however, who argue that the cost for a coronary artery calcium scan can be nominal.\n\nOther than this area of dispute, Nissen is pleased with the updated recommendations. \"The big picture is this is a reasonable set of guidelines,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Having high cholesterol at any age increases that risk significantly,\" Dr. Ivor Benjamin, president of the American Heart Association, said in a written statement. \"That's why it's so important that even at a young age, people follow a heart-healthy lifestyle and understand and maintain healthy cholesterol levels.\"", "California's Camp Fire, which obliterated 80% to 90% of the homes in one town, has left at least nine people dead.

Rick Scott leads incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by more than 12,500 votes, or about .15%. The spread in the governor's race is larger, with Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by nearly 34,000 votes, for a lead of .41%. In the narrowest contest, Democratic agriculture commissioner candidate Nikki Fried's advantage stands at 5,326 votes \u2014 just .06% \u2014 over Republican Matt Caldwell.\n\nWith the margins in all three contests at under .5%, the votes are now being recounted by machine. That process must be finished by 3 p.m. on Thursday. Races within .25% will then go to a hand recount of overvotes and undervotes. An overvote means a voter selected more than the allotted options on the ballot; an undervote means a vote selected fewer than the available choices or, in these races, none. The Senate race and the contest for agriculture commissioner both currently both fall within .25%.\n\nHours after the recount was formally set in motion, Gillum surprised supporters by withdrawing the concession he offered DeSantis on election night.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call we count every single vote,\" he said at a news conference in Tallahassee. DeSantis in a subsequent video statement said he would continue on with his transition plans and called the initial results \"clear and unambiguous.\"\n\nOn the Senate side, Scott's campaign welcomed the recount by calling on Nelson to opt out of it, which is his option under state law.\n\n\"It's time for Senator Nelson to accept reality and spare the state of the Florida the time, expense and discord of a recount,\" said Scott spokesman Chris Hartline.\n\nNelson, however, showed no signs of backing down.\n\n\"We believe when every legal ballot is counted, we'll win this election,\" he said in a statement.\n\nDuring a call with reporters later in the day, Marc Elias, his top recount lawyer, predicted that Scott's lead would shrink during the machine recount -- along with the tabulation of overseas and military ballots -- and then \"evaporate entirely\" after the more thorough hand review was completed.\n\nWhile the politicians and lawyers jockeyed to shape the narrative and activists kicked off new protests this weekend, demonstrators pooled on the streets outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections Office for a second straight day. Again, they targeted Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, chanting \"lock her up\" as she and others worked inside trying to finish the initial vote count before a noon deadline.\n\nThere were also more heated confrontations between protesters -- many in \"Make America Great Again\" hats -- and an increasing number of Democrats, most notably Gillum supporters, before and after the recount was formally called.\n\nScott had escalated already rising tensions across the state on Thursday night, when news conference he took a page from President Donald Trump and, without citing any evidence, accused \"left-wing activists in Broward County\" of trying to steal the election for Nelson. The county, in deep-blue portion of South Florida, is notoriously slow in counting its votes and as its tally mounted, Scott's lead had predictably diminished. In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump picked up the thread and accused the Democrats of attempting \"Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.\" After the official recount was announced on Saturday, Trump again tweeted, \"Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\"\n\nScott's request for an investigation into election-related fraud did not go far.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement said on Friday it was told by the Department of State, which is run by a Republican Scott-appointee, that they had received \"no allegation of criminal activity.\" On Saturday, the agency's elections division told CNN that two internal observers had \"seen no evidence of criminal activity.\"\n\nStill, Scott's campaign issued an ominous-sounding statement \"encouraging every Florida Sheriff to watch for any violations and take appropriate action.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Nelson campaign is plowing ahead with a lawsuit against the state over its process for validating vote-by-mail ballots. Elias has argued that Florida's signature-matching process put an undue onus on the \"untrained opinions\" of poll workers, which led to a \"complete lack of uniformity\" in how the ballots were being judged.\n\nOn Saturday, Elias told reporters he believed a decision in Nelson's favor could \"add thousands of additional ballots that have so far gone uncounted\" to the equation.\n\n\"We have sought a statewide remedy because we believe that all voters -- whether they voted for Sen. Nelson or for Gov. Scott -- should not be disenfranchised because an election worker doesn't believe that their signature in two different places are closely resembling,\" he said.\n\nThere is a court hearing scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has also injected himself into the fight, alleging on Thursday and Friday -- like Scott and the President, with no proof -- that there are \"shenanigans going on in Broward and Palm Beach\" before suggesting that a sinister cabal of liberals from Washington was at work trying to rig the election. In fact, out-of-state lawyers from both parties, including a handful who had significant roles 18 years ago, have been flocking to Florida ahead of the recount.\n\nLeading a call for Scott's campaign on Saturday, Graham touted Scott's legal team and again skewered Broward and Palm Beach election officials for their lack of transparency.\n\n\"Rick has a good team of lawyers,\" Graham said. \"Lawyers are not going to decide this race, the voters will. I support every valid vote being counted. But I also support the rule of law when it comes to voting.\"\n\nAround the state on Friday, allegations and rumors of misplaced or lost votes fueled simmering anger and confusion as the campaigns, lawyers, operatives and freelance rabble-rousers girded themselves for a re-run of the pitched partisan combat that took over the state during the 2000 presidential recount.\n\nOutside a mail distribution center in Miami-Dade County, a group of activists with images they said showed undelivered ballots inside tried and failed to get a meeting with a supervisor. Later in the day, a spokeswoman for the US Postal Service said it was \"researching the matter to verify that all ballots have been handled in accordance to USPS service standards.\"\n\nThe Postal Service did not immediately respond to a request for an update on Saturday. Elias confirmed Saturday that Nelson's team was tracking concerns about the facility.\n\nDetailed updates on the state of the race had been hard to come by ahead of Sunday's noon reporting deadline, leading Scott to successfully sue top election officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties for information on the total votes cast and how many of them had been canvassed.\n\nIn Broward, Brenda Snipes turned over information to Scott and his team for review late Friday. But before midnight, the campaign pushed out a new press release claiming Snipes had not fully complied with the court order \"because she refuses to confirm whether or not additional ballots exist that must be counted.\"\n\nAdding to Broward County's troubles, a CNN analysis of votes cast there suggests that ballot design could be responsible for a substantial difference in the number of votes cast between the race for governor and the race for senator in Florida.\n\nThis story is developing and will be updated.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

Woolsey and Hill fires.\n\nNorthern California's Camp Fire is now the most destructive and deadliest fire in the state's history .\n\nMore than 80 people are dead statewide, hundreds are unaccounted for and more than 300,000 people have been forced from their homes.\n\nBelow are other ways you can assist:\n\nTransportation", "Thane Rosenbaum is a novelist, essayist and distinguished fellow at NYU

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Back in the day when world events still had the capacity to shock, Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) -- its 80th anniversary commemorated Friday and Saturday -- was a clear foreshadowing of events that led to the Holocaust.\n\nGenocides, after all, don't occur overnight. The fraying of civilization happens first. During these two days of anti-Semitic rioting in 1938 in Austria and Germany, more than 100 Jews were killed, and 267 synagogues and more than 7,000 Jewish businesses were destroyed.\n\nToday, one doesn't have to search that far to see disturbing premonitions of Jew hatred in Europe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, marking the anniversary of Kristallnacht, condemned the resurgence of anti-Semitism online and in public spaces, citing several specific instances of violence.\n\nIn France, in 2014, a synagogue was surrounded by a mob chanting, \"Death to the Jews!\"; four Jews were murdered at a kosher market in 2015; and two elderly women were killed -- one beaten and tossed from her balcony in 2017 , the other stabbed to death and set on fire in 2018\n\nThis surge of hate in Europe is one reason what happened in Pittsburgh at the Tree of Life Synagogue was such a jolt to American Jews. The murder of 11 congregants may not have been the first recent attempt to kill Jews in the United States, but it instantly became the deadliest in America's history. Since then, Jews have been made agonizingly aware of the Anti-Defamation League's latest findings of a rise in reported anti-Semitic incidents -- a nearly 60% spike in 2017, after a 35% rise in 2016.\n\nThese two years coincide with the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dramatic spike in anti-Semitic incidents in US Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dramatic spike in anti-Semitic incidents in US 02:46\n\nWas the Tree of Life massacre America's Kristallnacht? The anguish of Pittsburgh may well cause many American Jews to become more wary. Perhaps some had become too complacent. Given the well-honed survival instincts Jews have cultivated throughout their history, shouldn't they have anticipated that America, one day, may no longer be such a safe haven?\n\nIt is a generally confusing time for American Jews. The Unite the Right catastrophe came with its own rallying cry: \"Jews will not replace us.\" This, at a rally ostensibly to preserve a statue of Robert E. Lee, whose cause had nothing to do with Jews.\n\nThe results of the midterm elections reflect a new progressive agenda within the Democratic Party -- the party to which the vast majority of American Jews belong. Jewish ethnicity and status as an American minority is not really part of the progressive calculus, however.\n\nNeither is unqualified support of Israel. Many progressives view Jewish-Americans largely as privileged white people, not necessarily as a group in need of special protection. To many of them, Israel is a colonialist enterprise, not a miracle of Jewish self-determination. Resolutions to boycott Israel continue to surface at American college campuses. The double standard and moral hypocrisy contained within them rouses little outrage.\n\nEven the past suffering of Jews counts for little nowadays in certain quarters. Trivializing the Holocaust and normalizing Holocaust denial have become distressingly common. The organizers of the Women's March refused to condemn the vulgar anti-Semitism of Louis Farrakhan, who recently compared Jews to \" termites \" -- a failure recently noted by actress and activist Alyssa Milano. And, yet, Jews were and remain at the forefront of the feminist movement.\n\nAnd then there is Donald Trump, whose connection to rising anti-Semitism is mind-boggling. The President struck a tone of moral equivocation after Charlottesville, and he was hesitant to denounce David Duke during the presidential campaign.\n\nYet, at the same time, the President's daughter and grandchildren are Jewish. Does he not realize that even tacit acceptance of Jew hatred endangers their lives? The man who has supported Israel in unprecedented ways is the same man who casually inserts code words for anti-Semitism into his public pronouncements.\n\nThe President may not be bookish, but he surely knows that words matter, otherwise he wouldn't trumpet dog whistles like \"globalists\" and \"America First\" whenever he feels like tossing red meat into the bread and circuses of those frenzied red states. The problem is the normalizing function these words possess. Repeat it often enough and it starts to feel true. Hitler railed against the \" lying press \" until he felt empowered to do away with them altogether. Winking too often at a primed audience can give license to the once unimaginable.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's nativistic, xenophobic statements about asylum seekers and illegal aliens resonate as all too familiar to Jewish ears, and may be the cause of its own anxiety. After all, the doomed Jews of Europe were largely not welcome in the United States during the Third Reich. They, too, were cast as a corrupting foreign influence that brought only harm.\n\nKristallnacht was a warning that many European Jews failed to comprehend. American Jews are correct in feeling anxious, even though Trump is no Hitler and America is not the Third Reich. I see no indication that Trump has anything against Jews; he just craves the adulation of crowds more than anything else -- regardless of who's in the crowd. And unlike Nazi Germany, violence against Jews in the United States is limited to the fringes of society. The people of Pittsburgh rallied to the aid of their neighbors. Law enforcement took immediate action and apprehended the perpetrator. Condemnation was widespread. Empathy was everywhere.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

over, the stage is now set for 2020, a year that will be defined by a presidential election and another fight for control of Congress.\n\nDemocrats faced a more challenging Senate map in 2018 than Republicans, in part because they had more seats up for election. But in 2020, the GOP will have to defend more Senate seats than Democrats. As of now, there will be 22 Republican Senate seats on the line, while Democrats will only need to protect 12 seats.\n\nNumbers alone don't tell the whole story, however. Many of the seats Republicans have to defend in 2020 are in solid red states like Wyoming, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Democrats, meanwhile, appear to have the most vulnerable seat on the map in Alabama, a state Trump won by double digits in 2016.\n\nThe Democrats who will have to defend seats in states Trump won are Sens. Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan. The Republicans up for re-election in states Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 election are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado.\n\nAnother race likely to be competitive is the open Senate special election in Arizona. Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, who was appointed to the seat held by the late Sen. John McCain, has said he will not run in 2020 when a special election takes place.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) An Oklahoma jury has awarded $25.5 million to the family of a cancer patient denied coverage by Aetna, with jurors saying that the insurer acted \"recklessly\" and that the verdict was meant as a message for Aetna to change its ways.\n\nThe award is believed to be the largest verdict in an individual \"bad faith\" insurance case in Oklahoma history, one court observer said, and could have major ramifications across the country for a form of cancer treatment called proton beam therapy.\n\nThe case revolved around the 2014 denial of coverage for Orrana Cunningham, who had stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer near her brain stem. Her doctors wanted her to receive proton beam therapy, a targeted form of radiation that could pinpoint her tumor without the potential for blindness or other side effects of standard radiation.\n\nAetna denied her coverage, calling the therapy investigational and experimental.\n\nOrrana and her husband, Ron Cunningham, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter, had been together since 1987. He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud. My wife wanted to make sure that it got out. Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst.

It's past time to hold insurers accountable.\"\n\nSome jurors said that one of the most convincing experts was radiation oncologist Dr. Andrew L. Chang, who explained why proton beam therapy was the best treatment for Orrana Cunningham. He was not involved in her care but was called as an independent expert by her attorneys.\n\n\"The thing I tried to illustrate to the jury is that proton therapy is not a new, experimental technique, like Aetna wants to claim,\" Chang said. \"Proton therapy is a well-established treatment for cancer and has been for decades. ... Nobody in the oncology community considers proton therapy experimental for the treatment of cancer.\"\n\nHe said he told jurors that Medicare covers proton treatment and that insurance companies often cover it for an array of cancers for pediatric patients, typically up to the age of 21.\n\n\"One thing we pointed out is that as much as Aetna and these other insurance companies like to say proton therapy is experimental, they always put a caveat in there that it's not experimental for pediatric patients,\" Chang said. \"We pointed out Medicare pays for it for 65 years or older. So, what is it about 22-year-olds to 64-year-olds that makes proton therapy experimental? There is no good answer for that; insurance companies call it that because they decided to deem it as such.\"\n\nTwo top cancer specialists, not affiliated with the trial, told CNN they agreed with Chang's assessment.\n\nIn Orrana's case, Chang said, the tumor was right next to her brain stem and optic nerve, and it had been growing up toward the base of her skull. He said he told jurors that standard radiation could've been used, as Aetna wanted, but the \"risks were severe.\"\n\n\"She would go blind. She would lose a significant portion of her memory on the left side of her brain and still not have a very good chance at a cure,\" Chang said. \"For her particular tumor, [proton therapy] was extremely valuable.\"\n\nBefore Orrana died, he said, scans showed that the tumor was shrinking and the treatment was working.\n\nAetna attorney Shely told jurors that this was a case \"of misplaced blame by Mr. Cunningham and his lawyers,\" according to the official court transcript.\n\n\"Aetna has full confidence in your ability to hear the evidence from that witness stand and then later compare it to the opening statement you just heard,\" Shely said during his opening statement. \"In short, the evidence that you will see and hear will convince you that Aetna has done nothing wrong, nothing.\"\n\nAfter considering the evidence, the jury did, in fact, find fault with Aetna's handling of the case, voting on Monday to award $15.5 million in emotional distress damages and on Tuesday tacking on $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nKent McGuire, a personal injury attorney in Oklahoma who watched parts of the trial, called the verdict the biggest bad faith insurance verdict for an individual case in Oklahoma history. \"It was certainly a stunning verdict to award that much money, and it was a message, too,\" he said.\n\nRon Cunningham said his wife would be pleased with the verdict.\n\nShe used to comfort him on hard days -- whether it was in the months after the 1995 bombing or after he'd find a child badly injured in a house fire.

Of his own battle with cancer in 1998, when she stuck by his side. Of washing her body as she weakened from cancer. Of simply missing the gal who stole his heart four decades ago.\n\nOrrana was known to take in stray animals. Cats, dogs, you name it. Ron would tell her he was the biggest stray she ever took in. He laughed while recalling that moment.\n\nHe then talked about the three Aetna medical directors; he said each testified that \"they wouldn't change anything they did.\"\n\nWhen the jury said Aetna \"recklessly disregarded\" Orrana's case, Ron Cunningham said, he finally felt justice.\n\n\"When they said that, it was like, 'I think we did her proud,' \" he said.", "(CNN) An Oklahoma jury has awarded $25.5 million to the family of a cancer patient denied coverage by Aetna, with jurors saying that the insurer acted \"recklessly\" and that the verdict was meant as a message for Aetna to change its ways.\n\nThe award is believed to be the largest verdict in an individual \"bad faith\" insurance case in Oklahoma history, one court observer said, and could have major ramifications across the country for a form of cancer treatment called proton beam therapy.\n\nThe case revolved around the 2014 denial of coverage for Orrana Cunningham, who had stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer near her brain stem. Her doctors wanted her to receive proton beam therapy, a targeted form of radiation that could pinpoint her tumor without the potential for blindness or other side effects of standard radiation.\n\nAetna denied her coverage, calling the therapy investigational and experimental.\n\nOrrana and her husband, Ron Cunningham, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter, had been together since 1987. He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud. My wife wanted to make sure that it got out. Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst. But little could've prepared him for that encounter with Aetna's attorney in the courtroom. He said he stood, stunned, trying to grasp what he'd just heard.\n\n\"That showed how callous these people are,\" he said.\n\nShely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurer, declined to comment on the encounter but maintained that it acted appropriately in denying coverage in this case, saying there is a \"lack of clinical data supporting proton therapy for treating nasopharyngeal tumors.\"\n\n\"While we have no comment on the ruling, juror motives or a potential appeal, we do want to make it clear that the proper steps under the health plan were followed in this instance,\" Aetna said in a written statement. \"As our chief medical officer noted in a post earlier this year, it's never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved -- it's the hardest thing we have to do.\n\n\"However, our guiding principles will continue to be proven effectiveness and member safety, as determined by rigorous scientific studies.\"\n\nDoug Terry, the lead attorney for the Cunninghams, offered a much different take.\n\n\"We believe this case pulled the curtain back on what goes on at a health insurance company when claims are being denied,\" Terry said. \"The jury's verdict delivered the message that the public will not stand for insurance companies putting profits before policyholders.\"\n\nDefense attorney: Aetna did 'nothing wrong'\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with cancer to be denied proton beam therapy by insurers, despite the recommendations of their treating physicians.

(The court cited security concerns .)\n\nKavanaugh also seems inclined against a prominent role at next week's annual meeting of the Federalist Society, the group working with the White House to confirm conservative judges, to which Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first appointee, gave a rousing keynote speech last year.\n\nWithin the court, Kavanaugh has deferred to his colleagues in oral arguments and quickly adhered to the court's institutional traditions. The other justices have gone out of their way to be publicly welcoming and have shown an unusual degree of collegiality all around during arguments so far this term, even laughing more at one another's jokes.\n\nIn the few cases he has handled so far, Kavanaugh has declined some opportunities to favor the Trump administration, separating himself from Gorsuch in early votes. He has aligned more with Chief Justice John Roberts than the far right of the bench.\n\nAll told, Kavanaugh appears to be lying low after the volatile confirmation process and buttressing Roberts' efforts to move the court away from the white-hot media spotlight.\n\nYet Kavanaugh, a political insider who spent 12 years on a US appeals court, also understands that the media scrutiny will fade. The record of Kavanaugh, 53 and appointed for life, will become clear only over many months and years.\n\nFor the law in America, the newest of the nine represents only part of a momentous change underway. For years as the justices met privately to decide cases in a rich oak-paneled conference room, the person whose views mattered most was Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded.\n\nA conservative with centrist tendencies on social issues -- including abortion, race and gay rights -- Kennedy was regularly the deciding vote. Like the lawyers who stood at the lectern and publicly argued before the high court, individual justices often tailored their arguments around the private conference table to Kennedy.\n\nNot one of the current nine has a similar centrist approach. Justices on both sides of the ideological divide are watching Kavanaugh for any clues about how to best approach the new justice.\n\nKavanaugh was carefully vetted by a Trump team that did not want a vacillating jurist in the mode of Kennedy.\n\nGorsuch has fulfilled those expectations , often partnering on the far right with Justice Clarence Thomas for an originalist approach to the law, tied to the Constitution's 18th-century origins.\n\nKavanaugh's style is different and he appears to be trying to make good on his oft-repeated confirmation mantra about \"always being a team player on the team of nine.\"\n\nWhere Gorsuch immediately opted against having his clerks join the clerk pool that collectively screens petitions for certiorari, seeking review of cases lost in lower courts, Kavanaugh has had his clerks join. (All justices but Gorsuch and Samuel Alito are in the so-called cert pool, which dates to the 1970s.)\n\nIn the private conference, the junior justice has the responsibility of taking notes on the proceedings and answering the door if any aide knocks to offer a document or even a fetched set of forgotten reading glasses or a coffee cup requested by a justice.\n\nThat person is now Kavanaugh. He will also be last in line to cast his vote. In tight cases, he likely would be the fifth conservative, sealing a victory for the right wing. Or he may prove unpredictable, perhaps even defying his benefactor.\n\nBefore this week's midterm elections, as Trump tried to rally Republicans, he constantly invoked Kavanaugh's appointment and the Democratic opposition he faced. The day after the election, the President boasted that the Kavanaugh strategy paid off.\n\n\"By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings,\" Trump said at a White House news conference.\n\n\"Tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' 05:29\n\nPlaying nice in public\n\nKavanaugh's response to the sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford prompted some lawyers and judges, including retired Justice John Paul Stevens, to question his temperament and ability to be an impartial jurist.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, Kavanaugh described Ford's claims as part of \"a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election ... revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\"\n\nIndividual justices are conflicted over how Kavanaugh's confirmation unfolded, yet all have an incentive to be collegial and forward-looking. They have projected a \"business as usual\" image, even appearing to be getting along better on the bench.\n\nKavanaugh has now sat through three weeks of oral arguments. He has held back and let his colleagues air their queries before jumping in. He also has tried to take opportunities to question both sides in fractious cases, perhaps to avoid being labeled with a predictably conservative approach.\n\nFellow justices have shown regard for his questioning, occasionally picking up on his line of inquiry.\n\n\"What the treaty seems to prevent,\" Justice Elena Kagan observed to a lawyer at the lectern in one case, \"is the state from taking either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh says, travel with goods.\"\n\nAt another point, Kagan, who sits next to Kavanaugh on the bench, said, \"I think the import of Justice Kavanaugh's question is that in the usual case. ... \"\n\nIn a separate dispute, after Kavanaugh had tried to enter the fray but was interrupted, Roberts stopped the lawyer at the lectern. \"I think Justice Kavanaugh had a question,\" Roberts said, ensuring Kavanaugh an opening.\n\nLater in the same argument, Kavanaugh said, \"to pick up on the chief justice's comments. ... \"\n\nJUST WATCHED Chief Justice: We speak for the Constitution Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chief Justice: We speak for the Constitution 02:02\n\nStaying close to the chief justice\n\nWhile they are united in public, with Kennedy's departure the court is more divided on the substance of the law, split between five conservatives (Roberts, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Clarence Thomas) and four liberals (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan).\n\nYet the chief justice has been determined to show that the court is above politics. Roberts may end up inching to the left himself in some cases, to avoid some 5-4 splits, and may find a new ally in Kavanaugh.\n\nHow those justices on the right band together -- or not -- could make a difference in the cases the court takes up and the fate of long-standing precedents, for example on abortion rights. Where Kavanaugh falls on the ideological spectrum could also affect larger constitutional dilemmas, provoked by Trump's demonstrated disregard for legal norms.\n\nKavanaugh and Roberts, a decade older at 63, have known each other for nearly 30 years. Both served in the US Solicitor General's Office during the George H.W. Bush administration, Roberts as a deputy SG and Kavanaugh on a fellowship for young lawyers. During the George W. Bush administration, Kavanaugh obtained top legal jobs and Roberts won court appointments, first to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in 2003, and then to the Supreme Court, in 2005.\n\nKavanaugh himself then served on the DC Circuit, reinforcing their common path. They have long had a friendly relationship.\n\nLast month, when Kavanaugh underwent a ceremonial investiture at the White House, following his 50-48 confirmation vote by the Senate, he went out of his way to praise Roberts.\n\n\"Chief Justice Roberts is a principled, independent and inspiring leader for the American judiciary,\" Kavanaugh said. \"As a country, we are fortunate to have John Roberts as chief justice of the United States.\"\n\nRoberts returned the favorable comments when he spoke of judicial independence, after referring to \"the contentious events in Washington,\" at the University of Minnesota the following week.\n\n\"As our newest colleague put it, we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation,\" Roberts said.\n\nNot siding with Trump -- yet\n\nThe 2018-19 session, which began a week before Kavanaugh was seated last month, is still so new that he and most justices have yet to issue any written opinions. But Kavanaugh has taken actions that separate him from the conservative stalwarts.\n\nIn late October, when the court took up a challenge to the Commerce Department's addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, Kavanaugh was with the majority in allowing lower court proceedings to continue and testimony to be taken from a key Justice Department lawyer in the dispute, while his fellow conservatives Gorsuch and Thomas dissented. (Separately, the full court blocked the challengers from obtaining testimony from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.)\n\nA week later, on November 2, the court by a 6-3 vote rejected a subsequent administration request to postpone the trial . Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch publicly dissented, but Kavanaugh, who may have been predicted to join them, did not.\n\nThat same day, the Supreme Court -- again over public dissents from Thomas and Gorsuch -- rejected a Trump administration request to block a lawsuit by youths who want to hold the government responsible for emissions policy and climate change.\n\nIn none of those three matters did Kavanaugh write anything that became public.\n\nTrump had no public comment on any of them, either. The President still speaks enthusiastically of his new nominee and suggests he believes the high court will be more on his side.\n\nWhen a federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a decision that blocked the administration from ending an Obama-era program shielding undocumented immigrants who came to the United States when young from deportation, Trump said he would be happy to take the case to the nine.\n\n\"We want to be in the Supreme Court on DACA,\" Trump told reporters Friday morning, later adding, \"where we'll be given a fair decision.\"\n\nAnd earlier in the week, before Tuesday's elections, the President raised Kavanaugh's name to rally campaign crowds. He cast Kavanaugh as a victim of false accusers and their Democratic enablers.\n\n\"False accusations. False accusations,\" Trump said. \"They want to ruin a man or a woman. Ruin a man.\"", "Less than a decade after Democrats successfully painted Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney as a multimillionaire too out of touch to be president, their party could wind up playing host to a battle of the billionaires in 2020.\n\nAnd after two of them, Bloomberg and Steyer, each plowed more than $100 million into this week's midterm elections to help Democrats successfully seize the House majority, some Democrats seem willing to listen to what they have to say.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be a big negative,\" Jeff Link, a veteran Democratic strategist in Iowa, said of a billionaire potentially seeking the nomination. \"Everything changed after 2016 because of Trump.\"\n\nRomney ran for president in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, when his wealth -- which came from his auto-executive father as well as his own work as a principal at private equity firm Bain Capital -- spawned endless commentary about the car elevator he planned to install at his California beach house.\n\nThose days are done. Romney was elected to the US Senate from Utah this week, but the real action was on the Democratic side, where a self-funding billionaire made history: J.B. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel chain fortune, won the Illinois governor's race after spending more than $170 million to unseat Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, a private equity mogul. Pritzker broke the previous self-funding record set in 2010 by tech executive Meg Whitman, a Republican who pumped $144 million into her failed gubernatorial bid in California.\n\nAnother Democrat, wine magnate David Trone, captured a US House seat in DC's Maryland suburbs this week after plowing nearly $16 million of his own money into the race.\n\nBuilding political operations\n\nSince Trump's election, speculation has swirled around other billionaires who could seek to challenge him. Celebrity businessman and billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who backed Democratic Hillary Clinton in 2016, has flirted with the idea (though he has signaled at times that he might run as an independent or a Republican.)\n\nSchultz's retirement in June as Starbucks' executive chairman -- and his sharp criticism of Trump -- has renewed talk of a possible presidential bid. He's also retained Steve Schmidt, architect of the late Sen. John McCain's 2008 Republican presidential bid.\n\nBut among the billionaires weighing the presidency, Bloomberg and Steyer have the running start.\n\nBloomberg, a former three-term New York mayor and media magnate, has a robust political operation aimed at electing candidates who support imposing gun-safety measures and confronting climate change.\n\nHe was elected in New York as both a Republican and an independent, but announced last month that he had registered as a Democrat. He plowed more than $110 million into the midterms, much of it to help Democrats flip the House. His Independence USA super PAC spent $45 million on television in the final two weeks of the campaign alone.\n\nThat gusher of money took Republicans by surprise.\n\nBloomberg's money \"was spent in a very strategic way\" that made it hard for Republicans to close the gap, said Courtney Alexander of the Congressional Leadership Fund, aligned with House Republican leaders.\n\n\"It was kind of like 'screw you' money that they could just throw around,\" she said Friday.\n\nBloomberg's eleventh-hour infusion also took some of its beneficiaries by surprise.\n\nHis political action committee, for instance, spent more than $400,000 on television ads in an under-radar race in Oklahoma's 5th Congressional District to aid Democrat Kendra Horn. By law, super PACs can't coordinate their spending decisions with the candidates they support.\n\nWard Curtin, Horn's campaign manager, said Horn had no idea the ads were coming but that Bloomberg's team had done its homework and struck advertising themes that complemented Horn's messages.\n\nOn Tuesday, Horn knocked off Republican Rep. Steve Russell in an Oklahoma City district Trump had won by double digits in 2016.\n\n\"The $400,000 in this market was significant,\" Curtin told CNN this week. Bloomberg's move, he added, was \"extremely savvy for a candidate who in some ways is introducing himself to Democrats.\"\n\nIn a post-election statement, the centrist Bloomberg said he \"was proud\" to help Democrats serve as a \"bulwark against a White House that has shown no respect for the rule of law,\" and he urged the Democrats \"to work across the aisle to tackle tough issues\" with congressional Republicans.\n\nFace of the resistance?\n\nSteyer, a longtime Democratic donor who walked away from his Farallon Capital Management hedge fund in 2012 to pursue political activism full time, has spent much of the last two years introducing himself to Americans.\n\nHe's sought to make himself the face of the ultra-liberal, anti-Trump resistance by starring in television ads that call for the President's impeachment. This year alone, he's barnstormed the country to headline nearly 40 town hall meetings.\n\nLeading Democrats, however, are less than receptive to his impeachment message, worrying it could unleash GOP charges of Democratic obstruction ahead of 2020.\n\n\"I don't think we should impeach a president for political reasons,\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in an interview Thursday with CNN's Chris Cuomo. \"But I don't think we should not impeach him because we think it's politically ... impeding for us to do so.\"\n\nBut Steyer's aggressive stance could help his own political ambitions: He's drawn a whopping 6.2 million signatures to his impeachment petition, giving his growing political operation valuable information about a significant base of like-minded liberal voters.\n\n\"I don't think there's anyone who has a bigger list in the Democratic Party right now,\" said Chris Lehane, a former aide to President Bill Clinton and a former Steyer adviser.\n\nSteyer pegs his midterm spending at $120 million. His political groups employed 750 people and drew 15,000 volunteers to what he called the largest youth turnout drive in US history.\n\nSteyer also has had high-profile stumbles on his path to a potential presidential bid. In the 2014 election cycle, for instance, his losses in Senate races outnumbered his wins despite investing more $70 million in contests that year.\n\nAnd he gained notoriety for early political stunts, such as renting an airplane to fly banners over Boston sporting events in 2013, accusing a Republican US Senate candidate of \"Running for Big Oil.\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with CNN this week, Steyer said he's learned lessons since plunging into politics six years ago.\n\n\"American politics are not as transparent as people think. Understanding it is something that takes a lot of effort,\" Steyer said.\n\nCan you relate?\n\nIn a post-election conference call this week with journalists and about 1,600 staffers and volunteers aligned with his political organizations, Steyer also insisted that he grasps the American electorate and its worries about issues such as college affordability and health care costs after a year of relentless travel.\n\n\"Whoever is going to be the nominee of either party, I think the critical question is: Do you understand what's going on in the ground, really, for people?\" he said.\n\nIan Russell, a Democratic strategist and former political director of the party's House campaign committee, said he doesn't \"think there's an anti-rich-guy mood\" in the party's electorate. But he said Democrats are going to be looking for who can win, in a presidential race likely awash in cash from large and small Democratic donors eager to oust Trump.\n\n\"There will be a lot more obsession with candidate quality than money,\" he said, particularly among the Democratic Party activists and voters in early contests in places such as Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nLink, the Iowa strategist, worked on President Barack Obama's campaign in 2008 and again in 2012, when Democrats cast Romney, the GOP nominee, as an uncaring multimillionaire. He said Obama and his allies could attack Romney because of his role at Bain, whose investments led to layoffs and outsourcing.\n\nBut Trump's populist appeal proves that enormous riches do not automatically disqualify a candidate, Link said. \"Trump, to his base, is completely in touch with them, he said.\n\nAnd at a time when Democratic Party activists worry about the growing influence of anonymous money in elections, Link said: \"These candidates can say, 'I can tell you where all the money is coming from. It's coming from me.' \"", "(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is CNN's America's Choice .\n\nThe network exit polls found on Tuesday that President Donald Trump's approval rating was just 45%. His disapproval rating was 54%.\n\nThis was in line with pre-election polling pegging his approval rating in the mid-40s among voters.\n\nWhat's the point: It turns out that Trump does not walk on political water. He does not defy political gravity. This is very bad news for him heading into the 2020 campaign.\n\nTrump was elected President with the worst favorable rating ever. This led many to speculate that traditional measures of gauging a politician's popularity had been rendered obsolete by him.\n\nSuch a view ignored a key factor of the 2016 campaign: Hillary Clinton. Clinton was the second least liked major-party nominee of all time. Nearly 20% of 2016 voters held unfavorable views of Clinton and Trump. Among these voters, Trump won overwhelmingly. That is, he was seen as the lesser of two evils.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections were the key test over whether the Republican Party could do well with an unpopular Trump and without an unpopular Clinton in the political arena. The answer was a resounding no.\n\nHouse Republicans' projected national House margin (-7 points) matched Trump's net approval rating in the exit polls (-9 points) nearly perfectly.\n\nIndeed, as I pointed out on Wednesday, the exit polls showed that voter choices this election were more highly correlated this midterm than in any midterm dating back to the first time the exit poll asked about the president's approval rating.\n\nThere has also been a question as to whether there is hidden Trump support not picked up by the polling. There wasn't on Tuesday.\n\nThe President's approval rating in the exit polls matched those of the pre-election polls of voters. At least nationally, there were no shy Trump voters. This would help to explain why the national congressional generic ballot average before the election predicted the national House vote well.\n\nThe good news for Trump is that the pre-election polls among adults that had his approval rating in the low 40s did not come to fruition in the exit polls. That's not surprising given that the voting population tends to be older and less diverse than the adult population at large.\n\nStill, a 45% approval rating is not very good. As the 2018 midterms showed, it would probably lead to his defeat in 2020.\n\nOf course, we're still two years away from that election. The President's approval rating could climb higher over the next two years. If it gets to 50%, for example, he'd be a favorite for re-election.\n\nThe bad news for Trump is that unlike presidents before him, he's never hit 50% approval among voters. In fact, with the exception of the honeymoon period immediately following his inauguration, Trump's approval rating has always been below his disapproval rating.\n\nThe best word to describe his support among the electorate is \"consistent.\" He earned 46% of the national vote in 2016 and a 45% approval rating on election night 2018.\n\nUnless the Democratic Party nominates someone as disliked as Clinton in 2020, an unpopular Trump won't be able to count on enough voters going with a third party candidate to allow him to sneak by in the Electoral College.\n\nThat's probably why Trump starts off the 2020 campaign as an underdog.", "(CNN) Authorities have identified a Facebook post believed to have been made by the gunman who killed 12 people at a bar in California, a law enforcement official said.\n\nIan Long, 28, burst into the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks and opened fire with a Glock .45-caliber handgun as patrons line-danced late Wednesday night.\n\nLong is believed to have posted the social media message around the time of the attack, according to the official, who is familiar with the investigation.\n\nIn it, the writer says: \"I hope people call me insane ... (laughing emojis).. wouldn't that just be a big ball of irony? Yeah ... I'm insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is 'hopes and prayers'.. or 'keep you in my thoughts'... every time... and wonder why these keep happening. \"\n\nWhen CNN read the post to a friend of Long's, who did not want to be publicly identified, the friend said, \"That does not sound like Ian to me at all.

developments this week stand to change the conversation when it comes to US immigration policy.\n\nHere's how things could play out going forward:\n\nThere's new hope for a DACA deal.\n\nCourts have blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protected so-called Dreamers from deportation. But advocates stress that's a temporary victory for those young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children -- especially since the Supreme Court might take up the matter. The bottom line, according to advocates: Lawmakers need to do something.\n\n\"It gives us an opening for us to stop the administration and hold the administration accountable,\" said Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, executive director of the immigrant rights group United We Dream.\n\n\"And it creates an opportunity for us to be proactive about policy reforms that will protect immigrant communities from deportation and will keep families together and provide a pathway to citizenship.\"\n\nBut reaching a deal is still harder than it sounds.\n\nSeveral moderate Republicans who had been pushing for a DACA compromise lost their re-election bids this week.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed little appetite for tackling immigration when he spoke with reporters this week.\n\nAnd the Trump administration has signaled it's going to keep pushing its immigration agenda.\n\n\"They're continuing to use every tool in the toolbox,\" said Tyler Moran, director of The Immigration Hub, which advocates for progressive immigration policies. \"They're not slowing down on immigration. They're speeding up.\"\n\nTrump will still wield power when it comes to enforcement.\n\nThe Trump administration entered a new rule into the federal register this week that would block migrants from applying for asylum outside of official ports of entry\n\nBut the asylum rule is another clear example of what the administration has shown time and again: It will take action on immigration, with or without Congress on board.\n\nControversial policies will face more scrutiny.\n\nSome of the administration's most controversial immigration policy moves are going to face a new wave of scrutiny in a Democratic-controlled House, where lawmakers have vowed to increase oversight hearings\n\nThat means we could learn many more previously undisclosed details behind f amily separations , the administration's decisions to end DACA and TPS and officials' decision to add a citizenship question to the census.\n\nBut Democrats don't control the House yet.\n\nAnd before they do, there's a budget showdown on the horizon in December.\n\nThat's not the only controversial immigration measure that could come up for debate. Another area likely to face pushback from some Democrats: requests for increased funding for immigrant detention beds.\n\n\"They're still not in control as we head into this negotiation,\" Moran said. \"Next year, you're going to have more muscle and more fight on that issue.\"\n\nTrump's next attorney general pick could have a big impact on where things go from here.\n\nWhile Trump repeatedly chided Sessions publicly, the former attorney general was an effective emissary helping to conceive and carry out many of the administration's hardline efforts.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sessions defends Trump on immigration policy Replay More Videos ...

risen to 23 with the discovery Saturday of 14 more sets of remains, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea told reporters.\n\nHonea said 10 of the victims were recovered from the fire-ravaged town of Paradise. He said seven people were found in homes, and three were outside. Of the remaining four, two were in cars and two were in houses in an area known as Concow.\n\nSaturday brought a break in the fierce winds that have whipped the three major wildfires in California that have destroyed a record number of buildings and displaced more than 300,000 people.\n\nBut officials know the gusts will be back Sunday and most evacuation orders remain in place.\n\n\"Mother Nature has given us a short reprieve ... but we know tomorrow Mother Nature's gonna turn her fan back on and the winds are going to start blowing,\" Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen told reporters. He said he cautioned his firefighters and the public not to be lulled by the better weather Saturday.\n\n\"Stay vigilant,\" he said.\n\nFire has killed nine people in Northern California and possibly two in Southern California. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Chief John Benedict said the charred remains of two people were found in a car in Malibu, but homicide investigators were still working the case.\n\nWinds could gust as high as 30 to 50 mph, depending on elevation, on Sunday, officials said. Much of the state hasn't seen rain in more than a month, according to CNN meteorologists, and the dry vegetation has only served to fuel the fires.\n\nLatest developments\n\n\u2022 Burning and growing: The Camp Fire is the largest of the three major fires, swelling to 105,000 acres by Saturday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. It is the most destructive blaze in the state's modern history. The Woolsey Fire doubled in size overnight, growing to 70,000 acres. The Hill Fire was at 4,500 acres.\n\nTrump tweets: President Donald Trump : President Donald Trump blamed the wildfires on the \"gross mismanagement of the forests\" in a tweet early Saturday. \"Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\" he said. In another tweet sent Saturday he wrote: \"Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic. God bless them all.\"\n\n\u2022 Massive evacuations: Fire officials estimate the number of people forced from their homes statewide is more than 300,000; in Los Angeles County it is 170,000.\n\n\u2022 Containment: Firefighters are struggling to put down the flames. The Camp Fire is 20% contained, while the Woolsey Fire is just 5% contained. The Hill Fire was 25% contained.\n\n\u2022 Destruction: In Northern California, nearly 7,000 structures have been destroyed, including 80% to 90% of the homes in Paradise, north of Sacramento, according to officials. In Los Angeles and Ventura counties, a significant number of homes were destroyed or damaged, fire officials said.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California Jacob Saylors, 11, walks through the burned remains of his home in Paradise, California, on Sunday, November 18.

Hide Caption 102 of 102\n\nCamp Fire\n\nThe Camp Fire has killed at least nine people in Paradise and destroyed 6,453 structures.\n\nThe bodies of five people were found in or near a vehicle, and the other four were in or outside a home.\n\nIt took just a few hours for the fire to explode in size after breaking out early Thursday morning. Among the communities hit was Paradise, a town about 80 miles north of Sacramento.\n\nFamilies raced to escape the blaze as it consumed much of the town. Footage captured by evacuees showed flames along roads, scorching trees and devouring houses.\n\n\"The flames were whipping and spreading so fast,\" Whitney Vaughan said after fleeing her home in Paradise . \"It began to jump the road. There wasn't anywhere to go.\"\n\nThe town was mostly empty, and the main road littered with downed trees and power lines. Burnt out cars line blackened roadsides, abandoned in the panic and chaos of the evacuations.\n\n\"We do intend to rebuild,\" Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said. \"It's going to be a process -- a lot of hard work, a lot of coming together.\n\n\"We want to see Paradise be Paradise again.\"\n\nAn estimated 52,000 people evacuated in Butte County, where Paradise is located.\n\nFire officials said three firefighters and some civilians were hurt, but details about their injuries were unknown. About 35 people have been reported missing, authorities said.\n\nWoolsey Fire\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled in Ventura County and in Malibu in Los Angeles County due to the Woolsey Fire, officials said.\n\nFirefighters worked to protect thousands of students and staff sheltering in place Saturday at Pepperdine University as flames started reaching the campus overnight, school officials said.\n\nLos Angeles County firefighters are battling the Woolsey fire near Malibu.\n\nThe fire crossed US 101 a few miles east of Thousand Oaks -- the site of Wednesday night's bar shooting -- and was headed south to the Pacific coast in the direction of Malibu Creek State Park and the city of Malibu, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.\n\nIn Malibu, mandatory evacuations were ordered for the entire city of about 12,000 people that's known for its celebrity beachside homes.\n\nTwo people were arrested in looting incidents Friday during the evacuations, according to Ventura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow.\n\nThe howling Santa Ana winds fueled the Woolsey Fire. These are strong, dry winds that high-pressure systems push from east to west, from the mountains and desert areas down into the Los Angeles area.\n\nFire officials said the winds had temporarily died down Saturday, giving them a brief opportunity to make progress.\n\n\"This is just a lull,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said, \"so we're going to take advantage of that and try to get as much line perimeter in as we can with the expectation that we will get more winds tomorrow.\"\n\nAnother round of Santa Ana winds is forecast to whip the area Sunday through Tuesday, though it may be weaker than Friday's.\n\nHill Fire\n\n\"It's been a brutal, hellish three days for the city of Thousand Oaks,\" City Councilwoman Claudia Bill-de la Pe\u00f1a said at a news conference on Saturday.\n\nA bridge paved with asphalt near Agoura Hills, California, was also heavily damaged.\n\nThe fire started Thursday and initially spread quickly, torching 10,000 acres in six hours. But firefighters have made some progress.\n\nPart of the fast-moving blaze was burning into the footprint of a 2013 wildfire, which could slow its spread, chief Lorenzen said.\n\nNo houses or businesses have been lost, but a number of RVs and outbuildings have been burned, and a firefighter suffered a minor injury, authorities said.", "bad url", "Paris (CNN) US President Donald Trump began his 48-hour visit to Paris on Saturday meeting with his host, French President Emmanuel Macron, a onetime friend who he chided on Twitter within minutes of landing in the French capital.\n\nThe men worked to paper over their differences during a morning meeting. But the effusive expressions of bonhomie that once colored their interactions were gone, replaced by businesslike handshakes and wooden declarations of cooperation.\n\nSeconds after Air Force One touched down at Orly Airport outside Paris on Friday, Trump vented on social media about a proposal for more robust European military cooperation floated by his French counterpart days earlier.\n\n\"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump wrote. The message appeared before he'd even gotten off his plane. \"Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nPresident Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\n\nIt was an inauspicious start to Trump's short visit to Paris, which kicked off Saturday morning with one-on-one talks with Macron.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, the pair seemed to gloss over whatever differences they may have on European military cooperation, saying they were aligned on burden sharing.\n\n\"We're getting along from the standpoint of fairness, and I want to be fair. We want to help Europe, but it has to be fair,\" Trump said. \"Right now, the burden sharing has been largely on the United States as the President will say and he understands that. He understands the United States can only do so much.\"\n\nMacron said his \"proposals for European defense are consistent\" with Trump's views. Later, a French presidential spokesman said Macron was able to clear up the \"misunderstanding\" about his views on Europe's defense policy during his meeting with Trump.\n\n\"I think this was a very good opportunity at least for the French President to clarify exactly what he meant, and at the end of today's talks they stated that they had reached agreement on this whole question of the vision of the transatlantic alliance and European security,\" the spokesman told journalists.\n\nThe reason for Trump's visit\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump spars with Macron as he arrives in France Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump spars with Macron as he arrives in France 02:28\n\nThe morning meeting precedes the real reason for Trump's visit: marking the 100th anniversary of the World War I armistice, which will bring leaders from across Europe to the Arc de Triomphe on Sunday for a solemn ceremony.\n\nTrump was also due to mark to the centenary with visits to burial grounds for some of the 117,000 American military personnel who died in the war. On Saturday, he was meant to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near where the Battle of Belleau Wood was fought in 1918, though the 50-mile journey was canceled because of foul weather. His chief of staff John Kelly lay a wreath there instead.\n\nHe will deliver remarks from Suresnes American Cemetery on Sunday -- Veterans Day in the United States.\n\n\"Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?\" Trump tweeted on Saturday morning.\n\nI am in Paris getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One. Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018\n\nTrump and Macron began their relationship as fast friends, extending invitations to each others' capitals for ceremony-filled visits. But differences on trade, climate change and the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal have soured their ties.\n\nThe tweet only underscored Trump's willingness to blow up his global friendships if he believes it better serves the United States or his own agenda. He has taken similarly assertive stances against leaders in the United Kingdom and at NATO hours before sitting for talks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Macron called for a \"real European army\" during a tour of the former Western Front, according to AFP\n\n\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\" Macron said, according to the French press agency.\n\nMacron also suggested that since the start of Trump's presidency, the US has been seen as a less reliable ally.\n\n\"When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,\" he said.\n\nMacron has been advocating a similar position for months.\n\nTrump's Friday tweet could preview another high-level international meeting in which the US President distances himself from traditional American allies. Unlike the tense G7 summit in June, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be present at this weekend's commemoration.\n\nEvolving relationship\n\nJUST WATCHED How the Macron-Trump bromance evolved Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How the Macron-Trump bromance evolved 01:51\n\nWhile both Trump and Macron appeared to be off to a warm start following Trump's inauguration, their relationship appears to have soured.\n\n\"Just bad. It was terrible,\" a source told CNN. \"Macron thought he would be able to speak his mind, based on the relationship. But Trump can't handle being criticized like that.\"\n\nAnd more recently, a senior diplomatic source told CNN that Trump was \"ranting and venting on trade\" with Macron during their bilateral meeting in September.\n\nThere was \"some rapport\" between the two, \"but it's not what it (once) was,\" the source said.\n\nHis meeting with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Saturday morning is the only meeting with another world leader on his schedule, though more informal encounters are possible at the Armistice ceremony and a subsequent lunch on Sunday. Other leaders attending including Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nUS officials said the civil war in Syria and efforts to counter Iran would sit high on Trump and Macron's agenda. And trade -- one of Trump's signature issues when he visits with foreign leaders -- was also likely to arise.\n\nDuring Macron's visit to Washington last spring for the first -- and still the only -- formal state visit, Macron lobbied the President to remain in the nuclear accord, including over an intimate dinner of dover sole at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate. But it wasn't enough to keep Trump from announcing within weeks that he was pulling out.\n\nSince then, Macron has issued warnings against nationalism and protectionism, even as Trump fully embraced those sentiments during a dark and angry midterm election campaign.\n\nBoth men find themselves politically humbled. Trump's Republican Party lost control of the House of Representatives during the midterm vote, and ongoing vote counts have given an edge to additional Democratic candidates.\n\nMacron, meanwhile, is sinking to new lows in polls, weighed down by unpopular reform efforts and an attitude that some French regard as aloof. Once viewed as the next center of European power as Merkel exits the stage, Macron now is fighting just to regain his standing at home.\n\nOne part of Macron's efforts was convening the Paris Peace Forum this week, intended to bring world leaders together in the goal of promoting peace just as the deadly events of 100 years ago are top of mind.\n\nBut Trump is skipping the forum, deliver his own address on Sunday afternoon before flying Air Force One back home.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

world. This story is part of As Equals , a year-long series.\n\nKampala, Uganda \u2014 When model and socialite Judith Heard was asked to pay $3,000 in blackmail money to stop her stolen nude selfies being published online, she said her heart skipped a beat.\n\nThe 32-year-old from Uganda didn't pay up and some time after that 2013 exchange, her explicit photos were posted online without her consent.\n\nIn May of this year, it happened again. Nude photos of Heard were leaked online, but this time they were followed by a warrant for her arrest.\n\nThe mother-of-three was charged under Uganda's Anti-Pornography Act , which criminalizes the production and circulation of \"pornographic material,\" including on messaging apps like WhatsApp.\n\n\"I would never think of putting out my nude pictures,\" Heard said.\n\nShe believes that they were taken from a stolen phone or laptop and says she never sent the photos to anyone.\n\n\"People should understand the pain we go through,\" Heard said about being the victim of revenge porn. When her photos were first leaked, she says it caused strife with family members and almost ended her marriage.\n\nThe people who stole her photos and shared them should be arrested -- not her, Heard added.\n\nBut the Ugandan government's new Pornography Control Committee (PCC) takes a different view.\n\nIn June 2018, the PCC, under the direction of the Ministry of Ethics, issued arrest warrants for eight people -- including Heard.\n\nAmong those arrested were women who say their nude pictures and sex tapes were shared online without their consent, police spokesperson Patrick Onnyango told CNN, detailing three separate cases, including Heard's. Student and model Lilian Rukundo and police officer Esther Akol were the other two cases cited by police.\n\nAkol, whose partially-nude photograph taken in uniform circulated online, claims that the image was Photoshopped, Onnyango said.\n\n\"She says her ex-boyfriend is the one who maliciously Photoshopped what you saw and started circulating on the social media,\" the police spokesperson explained.\n\nPCC chair Annette Kezaabu referenced Akol's case in a press conference , telling reporters that a woman can be both a victim and perpetrator at the same time.\n\nWhere do we want to see Uganda in the next 50 years? Do we want to be led by perverts? Annette Kezaabu, PCC chair\n\n\"We know that she took this photo privately, but we also ask, why did she take it in the first place?\" Kezaabu asked members of the press.\n\nKezaabu's comment is indicative of the PCC's role as a moral authority in Uganda, cracking down not only on pornography -- but what the government regards as society's ills.\n\n\"There is a way Ugandans want to see Uganda, and myself that's what I subscribe to,\" Kezaabu said, sitting in a hotel lobby close to the President's residence. \"Where do we want to see Uganda in the next 50 years? Do we want to be led by perverts?\"\n\nMarriage breakdown, the spread of HIV, teenage pregnancies and domestic violence are among the \"dangers of pornography,\" according to Kezaabu.\n\nShe said the government's \"eventual aim is to have no footage of sex or nudity on TV whatsoever,\" and that the committee intends to \"go after\" pop stars who wear revealing clothing.\n\nLindsey Kukunda, founder of Not Your Body, an online feminist website for those impacted by sexual harassment in Uganda, says that the recent arrests are emblematic of a wider, government-led victim blaming culture.\n\nWomen protest the anti-pornography and dress code legislation on February 26, 2014 in Kampala.\n\n\"I think that the Anti-Pornography Act is evidence of how little the government itself cares about women, about their rights, and also about, I would say, their desire to control a woman's agency,\" she said, suggesting that this has been the law's primary use -- rather than focusing on issues such as protecting children from pornography.\n\nUganda's Anti-Pornography Act, which states that \"a person shall not produce, traffic in, publish, broadcast, procure, import, export, sell or abet any form of pornography,\" first made headlines in 2014.\n\nThe bill originally included a clause prohibiting indecent clothing, a so-called \"mini-skirt ban\" which led to men stripping women in the streets. That clause was removed before the bill was enacted.\n\nMore recently, the government announced it had bought a \" pornography detecting machine \" from South Korea to scan mobile phones and electronic devices for explicit imagery.\n\nIt's now normal to witch hunt victims, which is the very opposite of what the law is supposed to do. Lindsey Kukunda, founder of Not Your Body\n\nKukunda says that the implementation of the 2014 Anti-Pornography Act has been more focused on \"traumatising women\" than protecting them.\n\n\"It's now normal to witch-hunt victims, which is the very opposite of what the law is supposed to do,\" Kukunda said. \"This practice of women being blamed for the actions of men who violate their privacy is so common and I don't see our women MPs doing enough to combat it.\"\n\nBut the woman leading the charge in Uganda's battle against pornography rejected that claim, saying that she wants to protect women.\n\nKezaabu said that if a woman is a victim of revenge porn, and her claim can be proven, the PCC will fight on her behalf to \"make sure that the perpetrator is apprehended.\" However, it is almost impossible for women to prove they didn't distribute or send images themselves.\n\nBut when asked about how that would apply in Heard's case, Kezaabu suggested the socialite had released the nude photos herself.\n\n\"Judith Heard is an older woman, who is in a certain trade. It looks very deliberate that she did that.\"\n\nHeard has strongly rejected Kezaabu's assertion and says that the government should at least feel sorry for someone whose photos have been leaked without their consent.\n\nWhy is it that women in Uganda are being punished for everything, instead of the government punishing the people who are damaging us? Judith Heard\n\n\"It hurts hearing someone say I leaked my photos,\" she said about Kezaabu's comments adding that people look up to her as a public figure.\n\n\"Why is it that women in Uganda are being punished for everything, instead of the government punishing the people who are damaging us?\"\n\nThe police continue to search for Heard's electronic devices, which she says were stolen with the explicit photographs.

Instead of giving money, some faithful are leaving handwritten messages giving the church an ultimatum.\n\n\"We will resume our weekly offering when the Bishop resigns or is removed,\" read one handwritten note that was placed in a Sunday collection basket and shared with CNN.\n\nThe source who provided the notes to CNN asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation. In an email, the diocese said it was aware of a few such notes received months ago.\n\nMalone came under fire after his former executive assistant, Siobhan O'Connor, leaked documents to CNN and other media outlets suggesting the bishop did not sanction priests accused of sexual abuse and concealed the identities of alleged predator priests.\n\nIn March, Malone released a list of 42 priests in the Buffalo diocese who had left the priesthood after facing accusations of sexually abusing minors. He has said his handling of some claims has \"fallen short of the standard\" but has maintained that he will not step down.\n\n\"The shepherd does not desert the flock,\" Malone said in August.\n\nThe New York attorney general has issued civil subpoenas for all eight Catholic dioceses in the state as part of a civil investigation into how the dioceses potentially covered up allegations of the sexual abuse of minors. A New York US Attorney subpoenaed the Buffalo diocese in June, according to diocese spokesperson Kathy Spangler. The US Attorney's office of the Western District of New York told CNN by phone that the office could not confirm or deny investigations.\n\nPriests join call for bishop's resignation, source says\n\nIn a meeting Malone had with priests Monday, two priests stood up and asked Malone to resign, according to a source who was in attendance.\n\nThe gathering was highly choreographed, according to the source, and included a prayer service, and an hour and a half of discussion about Malone's future as a Bishop. Malone insisted, according to the source, that he would stay on the job.\n\nThe diocese confirmed to CNN in an email that two priests asked the Bishop to resign during the gathering; but pointed out that more than 100 priests present supported him.\n\nBuffalo Deacon Paul Snyder was not at the meeting; but tells CNN that he is aware of at least 12 priests who would have liked to ask the bishop to resign but were too afraid to do so.\n\nChurch attorneys and at least one armed guard monitored the goings on inside the church during the meeting, the source said, deeming the attorneys and the armed guard as an intimidation tactic to deter priests from speaking out freely.\n\nCNN asked Spangler about the police presence inside the church during the meeting and she said Cheektowaga Police was called to ensure the safety of all those present, given that the meeting was a highly publicized event.\n\n\"As part of the police department's assistance, one uniformed officer was present in the church for part of the meeting,\" Spangler wrote in an email.\n\nPriest: Parishioners are 'leaving in droves'\n\nIt's unclear how many of the 600,000 Catholics in the Buffalo diocese would like for Malone to give up his leadership. But one priest who does not want to be identified, told CNN that attendance at his parish is hurting because of Malone's refusal to step down.\n\n\"My biggest concern is that it will be the slow death of the church if he remains,\" he told CNN by phone. \"People are leaving in droves.\"\n\n\"We've been wrestling some with our discomfort over supporting the diocese while Bishop Malone remains,\" read a handwritten note that was dropped in the Sunday collection basket and was shared with CNN.\n\n\"The bishop's response is that withholding contributions from local parishes hurts the parish who continue their ministries,\" wrote Spangler in an email to CNN. \"Withholding contributions sadly hurts the parish community directly and immediately.\"\n\nIn another letter to Malone from a parishioner, obtained by CNN, the parishioner urges him to step down and explains that his or her contributions to the diocese's $100 million dollar capital campaign called Upon This Rock will be redirected.\n\n\"We will honor our pledge by independently contributing to programs supporting Christian values,\" read the letter.\n\nAccording to Spangler, the funds from the Upon This Rock campaign and the donations in Sunday collection baskets are not used for settlements or legal fees associated with the sex abuse crisis.\n\nWhen CNN asked Spangler if parishioner attendance and donations were down, she said, \"There is no recent data on this.\"\n\nBishop rejects calls for resignation\n\nDeacon and church benefactor Paul Snyder went a step further. He asked for reimbursement for his contributions to the Upon This Rock campaign.\n\n\"I believe that donations to the Campaign were solicited under false pretenses,\" Snyder wrote in a letter to Malone and obtained by CNN.\n\nSnyder says that the documents leaked by O'Connor prove that the diocese knew about the sex abuse allegations by priests at the height of the donation campaign but did not disclose it to donors.\n\nAccording to the diocese website, Upon This Rock is an initiative designed to reshape the funding of church ministries. CNN's review of the promotional video on the site revealed that it featured Father Joseph Gatto. According to the Buffalo Diocese, Gatto was placed on administrative leave in September pending an investigation into a complaint that he made \"an alleged sexual advance\" on an adult.\n\n\"Fr. Gatto is on administrative leave which, at this time, is for investigative purposes only,\" wrote Spangler in an email to CNN. \"It is not a statement of guilt or innocence.\"\n\nCNN reached out to Gatto's church and also emailed him. His auto-reply says that he's on leave for \"health reasons.\"\n\nIn a press conference Monday, Malone reiterated that he does not plan to step down.\n\n\"The Diocese of Buffalo deserves to regain stability,\" Malone said. \"A resignation does not bring stability...

fell silent 100 years ago here, but a quiet battle still smolders on in this forest. Roots of trees and arms of ivy grapple with the legacy of four years of war, fighting to reclaim the landscape from the scars of a past conflict.\n\nWWI left behind a broken landscape: shell holes, trenches and soil sown with years of unexploded bombs. Today a forest blankets the battlefields. But it cloaks perhaps millions of dud shells, tens of thousands of bodies and one of the most toxic sites in France.\n\nNo-go 'zone rouge'\n\nThe front lines crisscrossed the fields of Verdun for almost the duration of WWI. Some 60 million shells were fired during the 10-month battle here from February to December 1916.\n\n\"The optimistic rate is that one in eight did not explode. That means that we probably have between seven and eight million shells that did not explode on the battlefield of Verdun,\" said Guillaume Moizan, 34, a local historian and guide. \"The pessimistic way would be to say one in four did not explode.\"\n\nThe destruction was total. A postwar report on these battlefields described the land as: \"Completely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to Agriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible.\"\n\nThe French government's response was to declare vast tracts of northern France off limits, creating a \"zone rouge\" or red zone.\n\n\"All the battlefield sites where the French government thought it would be too expensive to clean the soil to have it restored back to farming land were declared zone rouge,\" said Guillaume Rouard, a ranger with France's National Forests Office (ONF).\n\n\"From the North Sea to the Franche-Comt\u00e9 (Swiss border) we estimate that there were 150,000 hectares that were declared red zone and a large part was given back to agriculture,\" he added.\n\nMuch of the rest was eventually forested. Planted with German pine from the Black Forest as part of war reparations, the forest of Verdun was, from its inception, a symbol of healing and commemoration.\n\n\"It's allowed us to conserve all that's around you, the holes, the trenches -- we're in one of the rare zones in France where you can walk like it was in 1918,\" Rouard said. \"That wasn't really the objective right after the war. The objective was more to give a sense of production to this landscape destroyed by war.\"\n\nToday it holds a different role. Bunkers and trenches hide among the trees, jutting out of the undergrowth, paying silent witness to the 300,000 French and German men who died here.

It makes you think.\"", "Verdun, France (CNN) The guns of World War I fell silent 100 years ago here, but a quiet battle still smolders on in this forest. Roots of trees and arms of ivy grapple with the legacy of four years of war, fighting to reclaim the landscape from the scars of a past conflict.\n\nWWI left behind a broken landscape: shell holes, trenches and soil sown with years of unexploded bombs. Today a forest blankets the battlefields. But it cloaks perhaps millions of dud shells, tens of thousands of bodies and one of the most toxic sites in France.\n\nNo-go 'zone rouge'\n\nThe front lines crisscrossed the fields of Verdun for almost the duration of WWI. Some 60 million shells were fired during the 10-month battle here from February to December 1916.\n\n\"The optimistic rate is that one in eight did not explode. That means that we probably have between seven and eight million shells that did not explode on the battlefield of Verdun,\" said Guillaume Moizan, 34, a local historian and guide. \"The pessimistic way would be to say one in four did not explode.\"\n\nThe destruction was total. A postwar report on these battlefields described the land as: \"Completely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to Agriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible.\"\n\nThe French government's response was to declare vast tracts of northern France off limits, creating a \"zone rouge\" or red zone.\n\n\"All the battlefield sites where the French government thought it would be too expensive to clean the soil to have it restored back to farming land were declared zone rouge,\" said Guillaume Rouard, a ranger with France's National Forests Office (ONF).\n\n\"From the North Sea to the Franche-Comt\u00e9 (Swiss border) we estimate that there were 150,000 hectares that were declared red zone and a large part was given back to agriculture,\" he added.\n\nMuch of the rest was eventually forested. Planted with German pine from the Black Forest as part of war reparations, the forest of Verdun was, from its inception, a symbol of healing and commemoration.\n\n\"It's allowed us to conserve all that's around you, the holes, the trenches -- we're in one of the rare zones in France where you can walk like it was in 1918,\" Rouard said. \"That wasn't really the objective right after the war. The objective was more to give a sense of production to this landscape destroyed by war.\"\n\nToday it holds a different role. Bunkers and trenches hide among the trees, jutting out of the undergrowth, paying silent witness to the 300,000 French and German men who died here. The stony ruins of the area's nine villages, devastated during the war, lie dotted around the forest. One of them, Fleury, changed hands 16 times during the battle. Officially, they have \"died for France.\"\n\nSo savage was the fighting that no one knows for sure how many soldiers were laid to rest in the imposing white ossuary at Douaumont.

Matt McCoy learned Donald Trump had appointed Matthew Whitaker to be acting attorney general of the United States, he was aghast -- he believes Whitaker was behind a politically motivated prosecution that was personally \"devastating\" to him.\n\nIt started in 2007, when McCoy was a rising Democrat in state politics, and the state's first openly gay lawmaker. Whitaker was the US attorney for Iowa's Southern District at the time.\n\nA grand jury indictment accused McCoy of using his elected office to try to extort $2,000 from a Des Moines home security company where McCoy was a consultant. The charges came after an elaborate undercover investigation in which the FBI had McCoy's business partner wear a recording device. McCoy demanded money he says he was owed for his consulting work.\n\nIn an interview with CNN this week, McCoy said Whitaker \"certainly tried to prove that I had done something really awful when, in fact, it was a garden variety business dispute that should have been handled in small claims court, if anywhere.\"\n\nThe trial lasted more than a week, with prosecutors trying to prove the business partner never agreed to pay McCoy for his consulting and the defense torpedoing the partner's testimony because he couldn't recall many details and admitted he had trouble with sobriety, according to Des Moines Register articles on the trial.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Con las elecciones intermedias en el espejo retrovisor, una sensaci\u00f3n de presagio est\u00e1 invadiendo a Washington.\n\nLa gravedad y las consecuencias de la investigaci\u00f3n parecen opresivas de repente, mientras el fiscal especial Robert Mueller y escribe su informe final y el presidente Donald Trump busca controlarlo agresivamente.\n\nEl reci\u00e9n nombrado secretario de Justicia interino, Matthew Whitaker, y la posible l\u00edder futura de la mayor\u00eda de la C\u00e1mara, Nancy Pelosi, deber\u00e1n adaptarse r\u00e1pidamente a las circunstancias y poderes que los convirtieron en jugadores vitales durante un momento cr\u00edtico de la intriga.\n\nCada vez resulta m\u00e1s claro \u2014empezando por el furioso estado de \u00e1nimo de Trump\u2014 que el juego final de la saga sobre Rusia someter\u00e1 los mecanismos del gobierno de Estados Unidos a un estr\u00e9s extremo y pondr\u00e1 a prueba la cohesi\u00f3n rota del pa\u00eds.\n\nEstas son las personas claves que tienen en sus manos el futuro de la investigaci\u00f3n sobre Rusia.\n\nTrump: interrumpir o mantenerse en firme\n\nEl presidente se\u00f1al\u00f3 este mi\u00e9rcoles, durante su conferencia posterior a las elecciones, que si bien cree que la investigaci\u00f3n de Rusia es \u201cmuy mala para nuestro pa\u00eds\u201d hasta el momento no la ha suspendido. \u201cPude haberla terminado cuando quisiera. No lo hice. Y no existi\u00f3 ninguna colusi\u00f3n\u201d, insisti\u00f3.\n\nSin embargo, algunas especulaciones apuntan a que Trump podr\u00eda usar a Whitaker como herramienta para interferir en la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller o reprimir sus conclusiones\u2026 Incluso, para intentar despedir al fiscal especial. Cualquiera de esas opciones provocar\u00eda un gran incendio constitucional.\n\nPor otro lado, Trump podr\u00eda optar por esperar el informe final sobre las acusaciones de que su campa\u00f1a supuestamente conspir\u00f3 con Rusia en 2016 y \u00e9l obstruy\u00f3 la justicia para encubrirla.\n\nEl presidente ya ha revelado una visi\u00f3n amenazante de sus intenciones. A pocas horas de que las urnas cerraran este martes, Trump despidi\u00f3 al secretario de Justicia Jeff Sessions, quien se inhibi\u00f3 a s\u00ed mismo de supervisar la investigaci\u00f3n de Rusia.\n\nComo reemplazo temporal, el mandatario nombr\u00f3 a Whitaker por encima del subsecretario Rod Rosenstein, quien ha estado supervisando a Muller y sus investigaciones.\n\nAlgunos cr\u00edticos interpretaron la decisi\u00f3n de Trump como su \u00faltimo intento por socavar la indagaci\u00f3n o por eliminar a los funcionarios que \u00e9l ve como una amenaza. Existe un debate acerca de si el nombramiento de Whitaker por parte del presidente habr\u00eda sido en s\u00ed mismo un abuso de poder.\n\nA\u00fan as\u00ed, este jueves hubo algunas se\u00f1ales de que la supervisi\u00f3n de la investigaci\u00f3n no ha sufrido alteraciones. El principal funcionario de Rosenstein, Ed O'Callaghan, se reuni\u00f3 con abogados del equipo del fiscal especial en su usual encuentro quincenal, seg\u00fan le dijo a Laura Jarrett, de CNN, una fuente cercana al asunto.\n\nLa fuente explic\u00f3 que si bien Whitaker tiene la m\u00e1xima autoridad de supervisi\u00f3n como secretario de Justicia en funciones, la oficina de Rosenstein sigue encarg\u00e1ndose de la gesti\u00f3n diaria de la investigaci\u00f3n. \u201cEs como de costumbre\u201d, dijo la fuente.\n\nEl presidente Trump se encontrar\u00eda a s\u00ed mismo en un terreno peligroso si decide presionar la investigaci\u00f3n.\n\nWhitaker, el nuevo secretario de Justicia: en la mira\n\nCNN revel\u00f3 este jueves que Whitaker ha rechazado p\u00fablicamente la idea de que los rusos interfirieron en las elecciones de 2016. Una posici\u00f3n que que contradice las m\u00faltiples acusaciones de Mueller.\n\nAhora, con su nombramiento como secretario interino, qued\u00f3 de repente envuelto en la confrontaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y legal de mayor importancia \u2013que adem\u00e1s incluye diferentes ramas del gobierno\u2013 desde Watergate.\n\nWhitaker tiene el poder de restringir la investigaci\u00f3n y limitar el presupuesto para el equipo del fiscal especial. Tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda rechazar las peticiones de Mueller para solicitar acusaciones o citar al presidente.\n\nIncluso, tiene la posibilidad de evitar que el informe final de la investigaci\u00f3n se publique o de que no llegue al Congreso.\n\nMichael Conway, consejero de la Comisi\u00f3n Judicial de la C\u00e1mara durante Watergate, explic\u00f3 que la amenaza m\u00e1s siniestra para Mueller puede ser un intento silencioso de Whitaker por mantener su trabajo fuera de la vista del Congreso o del p\u00fablico.\n\nLos dem\u00f3cratas ya exigieron que el secretario interino se inhiba de supervisar la investigaci\u00f3n por sus anteriores cr\u00edticas contra Mueller. Algo que resultar\u00eda principalmente en un ejercicio acad\u00e9mico, pues es obvio que el principal atractivo de Whitaker para Trump es que no est\u00e1 impedido para supervisar la indagaci\u00f3n.\n\nLa primera se\u00f1al de que Whitaker apunta contra de Mueller podr\u00eda ser el hecho de que no haya acusaciones en las pr\u00f3ximas semanas ni indicios de actividad en el jurado de investigaci\u00f3n. Pero, si las acusaciones contin\u00faan, entonces eso revelar\u00eda que Whitaker retrocedi\u00f3.\n\nAhora, el nuevo secretario interino de Justicia se arriesga a terminar en una conspiraci\u00f3n si el presidente u otros funcionarios intentan obstruir ilegalmente la investigaci\u00f3n. Es probable que la nueva mayor\u00eda dem\u00f3crata de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes lo llame al Capitolio en el nuevo a\u00f1o y \u00e9l se vea obligado a declarar bajo juramento sobre su nombramiento. Tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda recordar que el secretario de Justicia de Nixon, John Mitchell, fue condenado por su papel en Watergate.\n\nMueller: \u00bfmantener la calma y seguir?\n\nEl silencio ha sido la mejor defense de Mueller contra los feroces esfuerzos de Trump y de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n conservadores por arrastrarlo al pantano pol\u00edtico.\n\nAs\u00ed que es \u2013y siempre lo ser\u00e1\u2013 imposible saber qu\u00e9 piensa sobre la nueva jerarqu\u00eda del Departamento de Justicia.\n\nCNN report\u00f3 este jueves que el fiscal especial ya comenz\u00f3 a escribir su informe final. La actividad del jurado investigador durante las \u00faltimas semanas indica que Mueller trata de averiguar si Roger Stone, asesor de Trump, sab\u00eda de antemano que WikiLeaks publicar\u00eda material hackeado durante la campa\u00f1a de 2016.\n\nPero, ese mismo d\u00eda tambi\u00e9n lleg\u00f3 un recordatorio de que su libertad para actuar estar\u00eda en duda. Michael Dreeben, un fiscal de la oficina del Mueller, reconoci\u00f3 ante un tribunal que Whitaker podr\u00eda cambiar o rescindir la orden que design\u00f3 al fiscal especial en mayo de 2017.\n\nMueller cuenta con cierta protecci\u00f3n en su cargo inicial por parte del subsecretario Rosenstein.\n\nAhora, si Whitaker toma medidas para restringir a Mueller, entonces se le exigir\u00e1 que les explique a los l\u00edderes de las comisiones judiciales del Senado y la C\u00e1mara por qu\u00e9 lo hizo.\n\nEn teor\u00eda, Mueller solo puede ser despedido por una causa o mala conducta.\n\nPelosi: el control institucional sobre Trump\n\nEs probable que Nancy Pelosi sea la pr\u00f3xima presidenta de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes y, por lo tanto, tenga el poder de ejercer un control institucional del gobierno de Trump.\n\nElla tendr\u00e1 autoridad sobre las comisiones de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes que supervisar\u00e1n a Trump y al Departamento de Justicia. Este jueves, llev\u00f3 a cabo una conferencia telef\u00f3nica con miembros nuevos y actuales de los comit\u00e9s para discutir el despido de Sessions y el nombramiento de Whitaker, seg\u00fan le fuentes a CNN.\n\nLos dem\u00f3cratas ya han indicado que investigar\u00e1n la decisi\u00f3n de Trump de elegir a Whitaker como secretario interino. Es probable que revivan la investigaci\u00f3n de Rusia de la Comisi\u00f3n de Inteligencia de la C\u00e1mara cuando obtengan la ventaja.\n\nPelosi enfrenta tensiones en m\u00faltiples direcciones. Debe encarar el imperativo de responder a cualquier intento de Trump por limitar a Mueller. Pero, a medida que comienzan los preparativos para las elecciones de 2020, tambi\u00e9n debe protegerse contra las acciones que el Partido Republicano podr\u00eda retratar como un exceso.\n\nLaura Jarrett, Evan Perez, Sara Murray, Pamela Brown, Andrew Kaczynski y Adam Levine, todos de CNN, contribuyeron a esta historia", "La legisladora electa por Nueva York Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez enfrenta un problema de presupuesto, seg\u00fan el diario The New York Times.

It burned through 20,000 acres in less than 14 hours on Thursday. By Monday, it had reached 113,000 acres.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties doubled in size in a 90-minute period Friday morning, to 8,000 acres. By Monday morning, it was up to more than 91,500 acres. The Hill Fire in Ventura County has torched 4,531 acres.\n\nHere's why the fires are moving so quickly:\n\nPowerful winds\n\nIn Southern California, the Santa Ana winds pushing the fires are expected to remain strong in Ventura and Los Angeles counties through Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said Monday.\n\nIn fact, the strongest winds for Southern California may come Tuesday and could reach near-hurricane gale force, he said.\n\nThese winds, which began in the middle of last week, may last through the end of this week.\n\nIn Northern California, the offshore winds that had been whipping the area for days are expected to die down Monday, Hennen said. The classic offshore flow was similar to the Santa Ana winds.\n\nLack of rain, dry conditions\n\nThough the drought in California has eased somewhat, all of the state is still abnormally dry, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. That makes a lot of dry vegetation for the fires to burn.\n\nMore than half the state is in a moderate drought or worse and 18% of the state, including the area near the Woolsey Fire, is in severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nOver the past month, much of the state has received less than 5% of its normal rainfall.\n\nTim Chavez, a fire behavior analyst for Cal Fire, said the Camp Fire is \"unique to be this late in northern California.\"\n\nNormally, a series of storms would have dampened the woods and brush by now, he said Friday at a news conference. But it hasn't rained much this fall, he said, creating \"mid-summer-like conditions.\"\n\n\"It kind of lined up perfectly to have the large 90,000-plus acre fire run we had (Thursday),\" Chavez said. \"Fuels will continue to get drier and drier and drier until we do finally get a season-ending rainfall event.\"\n\nThe terrain makes it hard for firefighters\n\nThe hills and canyons of Southern California are beautiful, but they can make it difficult for firefighters to gain access to wildfires.\n\nThe fire that broke out Friday near the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens occurred on a steep hillside that could not be accessed by firetrucks, so firefighters had to approach the fire on foot, CNN affiliate KCBS reported.\n\nThe canyons can accelerate fires. They act as funnels for the wind, which pushes already heated air upward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Family prays as they drive through wildfire Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Family prays as they drive through wildfire 01:11\n\nClimate change may make things worse\n\nClimate change is not directly causing the fires to spread quickly, but it has created conditions conducive to feeding fires -- such as drier air and plant life. That's contributing to more days of extreme fires, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nCalFire says the five most destructive fires in California history have occurred since 2015. The organization has been keeping statistics for 100 years. The list does not include the Camp Fire, which would top the list.\n\nAnd a Columbia University study released in 2016 says human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the Western United States over the last 30 years.\n\nCalifornia's fourth climate change assessment, issued last August, said the state's forests will become more vulnerable to wildfires because of climate change.\n\nThe assessment says that by the year 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the average area burned by wildfires would increase 77%.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the state's number of most-destructive fires that have occurred since 2015.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Thirty billion robocalls were made to American consumers in 2017, according to YouMail, a robocall-blocking service. And while robocalls, made with an automated dialer or using a prerecorded or artificial voice, torment Democrats, Republicans and independents alike, even on this issue, Washington leadership has found a way to divide along party lines.\n\nMargot Saunders\n\nThe division is not over whether robocalls generally are a nuisance that should be addressed, but over which robocalls should be stopped. The robocalling industry is pushing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deregulate all automated robocalls made with a human agent by interpreting the definition for \"automated telephone dialing systems\" (autodialers) in a way that would not cover any automated systems being used by the callers.\n\nBusinesses using robocalls for debt collection and telemarketing are trying to capitalize on a recent DC Circuit Court decision that tasked the FCC with revisiting some of the rules that govern robocalls under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ). The TCPA requires that callers have consent when they use autodialers to call cell phones, and that consumers can revoke that consent to stop the robocalls.\n\nHowever, partisan lines have been drawn over whether some well-known companies, including many creditors and debt collectors, should be exempted from the TCPA's restrictions altogether. This would mean that consumers would no longer have the ability to stop calls from callers collecting debts -- regardless of how many times a day or a week the calls are made or whether they are even reaching the correct party. While some Democratic senators have opposed the loosening of regulations that would allow consumers to be inundated by these unwanted calls, Republicans have not taken action to stand up for consumers' rights.\n\nCongress passed the TCPA in 1991 to address a surge in unwanted robocalls and faxes. The FCC has interpreted the TCPA to bar unwanted text messages as well as autodialed calls to cell phones without the recipient's consent.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN) George Lakoff has a warning for the national news media: Don't adopt President Trump's distorted framing of events.\n\nLakoff is a well-known linguist and a staunch critic of Trump.

And so the question is, do we have the political courage in the state of Iowa or some other state to nullify Obamacare and pay the consequences for that?\"\n\n\"The federal government's done a very good job about tying goodies to our compliance with federal programs, whether it's the Department of Education, whether it's Obamacare with its generous Medicare and Medicaid dollars and the like,\" he added. \"But do I believe in nullification? I think our founding fathers believed in nullification. There's no doubt about that.\"\n\nWhitaker added he didn't think states had the \"political courage to nullify Obamacare.\"\n\nThe notion that states can do away with federal law has been at the heart of some of the country's biggest conflicts.\n\n'Nullification as a serious, mainstream legal argument didn't survive the Civil War (or the constitutional amendments that followed),\" said University of Texas law professor and CNN contributor Stephen Vladeck. \"It's irreconcilable not only with the structure of the Constitution, but with its text, especially the text of the Supremacy Clause of Article VI\u2014which not only makes federal law supreme, but expressly binds state courts to apply it. For someone who holds those views to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer, even temporarily, is more than a little terrifying.\"\n\nWhitaker also said he believed that the courts were the inferior branch of the federal government, calling into question one of the most consequential rulings in Supreme Court history, Marbury vs. Madison, the 1803 case which established the power of federal courts to determine whether decisions or laws taken by by the President and Congress are constitutional.\n\n\"It is completely fraught with peril for 200 years of history and Marbury vs. Madison and the fact that the courts have become more powerful even though they're supposed to be the inferior branch,\" he added in the speech. \"They have become more powerful than the other two branches because the other two branches lack political courage to stand up,\" he said.\n\nWhitaker made similar comments in support of nullification at an April 2014 Senate debate , where he again said states would need political courage to do it.\n\n\"Nullification? I think states could try to nullify,\" Whitaker said. \"But we have moved so beyond our constitutional framework that really the federalist system that was imagined, where the states created the federal government, I continue to be worried that we've moved so far beyond that the states are not willing to exercise that power for fear of what the federal government would do in response,\" Whitaker said.\n\n\"But the federal government is smart. What have they done? They attach strength,\" he added. \"They don't just pass a law and mandate a state does something. They say we really want you to expand Medicaid, for example, and then we put strings attached, that we're going to pay for 95% or whatever the percentage -- just pay a little bit. And so I think nullification would be a brave and bold political act of our state leaders. I don't see that across the nation as I look at who we elect to statewide office.\"\n\n\"Whitaker's view of nullification is strictly political. That is, he would like it, politically, if States could disobey (nullify) federal law. As a legal matter, however, nullification finds no support in Constitutional law,\" said Michael Zeldin, a CNN legal analyst. \"Indeed, Whitaker himself acknowledges this ... As acting Attorney General, I presume he will uphold federal legal principals.\"\n\nThe issue of nullification has never been upheld in federal court and is criticized by constitutional scholars. Most famously, in the 1830s, South Carolina and its US senator, John C. Calhoun, sparked a national crisis by declaring void two federal tariffs. Congress then authorized President Andrew Jackson to collect the tariffs with force.", "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) \u2013 Aunque podr\u00eda beneficiar el bolsillo de los mexicanos, una nueva iniciativa para ponerle freno a las comisiones bancarias en el pa\u00eds ha sido cuestionada. El senador Ricardo Monreal del partido Morena, el mismo del presidente electo Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, plante\u00f3 este jueves una medida que prohibir\u00eda a los bancos el cobro de ciertas comisiones por diversos conceptos. Seg\u00fan argumenta la propuesta, entre el 30% y 39% de las ganancias que percibe la banca del pa\u00eds proviene de estos cargos adicionales.\n\n\u201cEl alarmante y excesivo abuso de comisiones bancarias en perjuicio de los mexicanos se hace m\u00e1s evidente cuando se refiere que el ingreso por el cobro de este concepto ascendi\u00f3 en 2017 a m\u00e1s de 108.000 millones de pesos (unos 5.362 millones de d\u00f3lares), 8% m\u00e1s que en 2016\u201d, explic\u00f3 Monreal en el documento de la medida. Y, en lo que respecta al primer trimestre de este a\u00f1o, a\u00f1adi\u00f3, el 51% de las utilidades reportadas por parte de las instituciones financieras obedeci\u00f3 al concepto de comisiones que se les cobraron a los usuarios, alcanzando su punto m\u00e1s alto en mayo.\n\nLa propuesta tambi\u00e9n indic\u00f3 que en otros pa\u00edses de Latinoam\u00e9rica el porcentaje de ingresos por comisiones es mucho menor al 30% que registra M\u00e9xico: 21% en Panam\u00e1, 19% en Bolivia y 7% en Colombia. \u201cLos bancos han sabido c\u00f3mo sacar provecho de la desinformaci\u00f3n de sus usuarios, pues solo en el primer trimestre de 2018 se presentaron ante la (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para la Protecci\u00f3n y Defensa de los Usuarios de Servicios Financieros) Condusef 85.698 quejas relacionadas con reclamos por cobro de comisiones no reconocidos\u201d, insisti\u00f3 el documento.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 son las comisiones bancarias y cu\u00e1les se quieren eliminar?\n\nEl Banco de M\u00e9xico define las comisiones como \u201ccualquier cargo, independientemente de su denominaci\u00f3n o modalidad distinto al inter\u00e9s, que una entidad financiera cobra a un cliente\u201d. Seg\u00fan la iniciativa, existen actualmente 35 conceptos de comisi\u00f3n en el Sistema Financiero Nacional y Banxico tiene registradas 5.310 comisiones espec\u00edficas por diversos productos y servicios.\n\nActualmente, la ley mexicana proh\u00edbe el cobro de comisiones por consulta de saldo en ventanilla, recepci\u00f3n de pagos de cliente o usuarios de cr\u00e9ditos otorgados por otras entidades financieras y por el dep\u00f3sito de un cheque para abono en la cuenta del depositante que sea devuelto o rechazado. Lo que busca el nuevo proyecto es eliminar el costo de otros conceptos adicionales. Espec\u00edficamente estos:\n\n1. Por operaciones de consulta de saldo y retiro en efectivo en cajeros autom\u00e1ticos\n\ninternos\n\n2. Por no facturar monto m\u00ednimo a comercios que hacen uso del producto de terminal de punto de venta\n\n3. Por reposici\u00f3n de pl\u00e1stico bancario a causa de robo o extrav\u00edo\n\n4.

Por solicitud de estado cuenta de meses anteriores en sucursal y v\u00eda telef\u00f3nica;\n\n9. Por transferencia a otros bancos, exitosa o no\n\n10.

Citando al banco BASE, el medio indic\u00f3 que la ca\u00edda del peso se relaciona con un aumento en la percepci\u00f3n de riesgo para M\u00e9xico tras la iniciativa de Morena. De hecho, se\u00f1al\u00f3 que el proceso no solo afecta la expectativa de ganancias de los bancos sino que tambi\u00e9n conduce a p\u00e9rdidas en el mercado de capitales y acent\u00faa las dudas sobre c\u00f3mo el gobierno entrante tomar\u00e1 decisiones en el sector. Adem\u00e1s, como inform\u00f3 Expansi\u00f3n, medio aliado de CNN, las acciones de los bancos del pa\u00eds se desplomaron tras conocerse la propuesta.\n\nPor su parte, la Condusef dijo este viernes que la propuesta de Morena debe atenuarse. \u201cLa iniciativa se excedi\u00f3 al hablar de prohibir comisiones, en todo caso se regulan, pero no se puede hablar de prohibirlas o desaparecerlas\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 en entrevista el presidente de la entidad Mario Di Costanzo, como report\u00f3 Expansi\u00f3n. Aunque reconoci\u00f3 no estar de acuerdo con la eliminaci\u00f3n de tres de los puntos de la medido, explic\u00f3 que se puede reducir o incluso dejar por fuera algunas comisiones. Si se llegan a eliminar todos los conceptos que plantea Morena, el ingreso por esta raz\u00f3n se reducir\u00edan a la mitad seg\u00fan c\u00e1lculos de la Condusef. \u201cEs un tema importante y necesario, aunque no puede ser visto de una manera tan radical\u201d, dijo Di Constanzo.\n\nTras los primeros coletazos de la medida, L\u00f3pez Obrador se pronunci\u00f3 al respecto y le baj\u00f3 el tono a la pol\u00e9mica. El presidente electo sostuvo que, al menos en la primera parte de su gobierno, no se modificar\u00e1 el marco legal de la banca y de las instituciones financieras. \u201cSomos respetuosos de las iniciativas que presenten los legisladores, pero nuestra pol\u00edtica es la de no modificar el marco legal con relaci\u00f3n al funcionamiento de bancos y de las instancias financieras\u201d.\n\nPor su parte, Ricardo Monreal sostuvo que antes de aprobar cualquier medida se va a escuchar \u201ca las instituciones financieras, a los grupos econ\u00f3micos y a todos\u201d.

Though there was no loss of life, the storm battered the city's buildings, causing more than $1 billion in insurance claims according to some estimates\n\nBut it was the city's green spaces that incurred the greatest damage. The city government estimates that 54,000 trees were felled during the storm, though experts say the number could be nearly double that figure.\n\nMany of those fallen trees have remained on the ground, blocking paths and walkways.\n\nIt's an unusual sight in a place that prides itself on urban efficiency. The cleanup after the previous typhoon, Hato in 2017, also one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the city, took just days.\n\nA school bus in Hong Kong's Heng Fa Chuen is seen after being destroyed by a tree during Typhoon Mangkhut.\n\nJim Chi-yung, a professor at The Education University of Hong Kong and an expert in urban green spaces, estimates that more than 100,000 trees came down in the storm, pointing to the fact that the government numbers only include the ones reported to authorities.\n\n\"I would describe it as catastrophic in terms of the lost big trees. Over half of our bigger trees in the city are gone,\" Jim said.\n\nHong Kong is well known as an urban jungle, with skyscrapers jutting out of the island's hillside, but the city is surprisingly green and rural.

Without that underground support, big trees were bound to come down in a powerful storm, according to Jim.\n\n\"A lot of the trees are growing in a tiny volume of soil. That's why they toppled so easily,\" he said.\n\nA flooded and destroyed playground in Hong Kong's Heng Fa Chuen neighborhood is seen after the storm hit.\n\nAs Hong Kong had never seen a storm of Mangkhut's magnitude, many of the weaker trees and branches were felled.\n\nBut it also means areas of the city are completely denuded.\n\nResidents have reported seeing wild boars, monkeys and snakes in unusual urban areas. The working theory is that they lost their habitat in the typhoon.\n\nOne positive is that when another storm as strong as Mangkhut comes along -- something authorities in Hong Kong are worried about due to the effects of climate change -- there is unlikely to be as much green waste, Jim says.\n\nCows are seen roaming the streets and sidewalks in the aftermath of Typhoon Mangkhut.\n\nThe tree graveyard\n\nMany of the trees collected by authorities in Hong Kong have made their way to the site of the former Kai Tak airport, located along Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor.\n\nThe airport was once a famous part of Hong Kong's skyline, as planes would peek through the city's sprawl as they approached the runway.

It also said that the moisture content of the waste made it difficult to recycle.\n\nIt also said it will introduce more \"diverse proposals for treating yard waste\" in the future.\n\nA crane rummages through felled trees at Kai Tak.\n\n'The evolution of the city'\n\nThe Hong Kong Development Bureau, the government agency charged with replacing the fallen trees, plans to replenish the urban greenery using the \"Right Tree, Right Place\" principle -- meaning it will take into account a multitude of factors when considering what to plant.\n\nWhile that may result in stronger, healthier trees, it also means parts of the city will look markedly different.\n\n\"Some of the fallen trees might be suitable at the time of planting years ago, but having regard to the evolution of the city, re-examination of the growing environment is necessary to ensure selection of suitable and proper tree species,\" the department said in a email to CNN.\n\nThe Development Bureau has already started a review of the city's urban landscape that it says it will be used in the eventual replanting plan. They are considering everything from street environment, microclimate, adjacent structures and facilities above ground and underground, planting area and soil volume.\n\nThe plan could work, says Jim, but \"the devil is in the details.\"\n\nCritics like Williams and Jim worry the government is all talk, and won't follow through on its promise to plant suitable replacement.\n\n\"In the countryside, there's some natural regeneration ... but in the city, I think we might have lost some of these trees for good,\" Williams said.", "Sen.

Son los casos del italiano Giovanni Resselech, que organiz\u00f3 dos temporadas de lucha en 1910, o el belga Constant le Marin, quien en 1921 incluso present\u00f3 una funci\u00f3n donde se enfrentaron un mexicano y un rumano.\n\nCon esos antecedentes, y con la popularidad que estaba adquiriendo esta actividad, al final el 21 de septiembre de 1933 se registr\u00f3 la primera funci\u00f3n de lucha libre en la Arena M\u00e9xico, antes Modelo.\n\nEsa noche abri\u00f3 sus puertas para un combate entre Yaqui Joe, un luchador del estado norte\u00f1o de Sonora, y Bobby Sampson, un californiano, excampe\u00f3n de la Marina. Y gan\u00f3 el mexicano, marcando el inici\u00f3 de una historia que hoy sigue viva.\n\nEse mismo a\u00f1o se habilit\u00f3 un gimnasio justo al lado de la Arena, que pasar\u00eda a ser luego la Escuela de Lucha Libre, una especie de semillero para talentos, en principio aficionados o nacientes luchadores extranjeros.\n\nTras la m\u00e1scara\n\nLa lucha libre no se puede entender sin las incomparables m\u00e1scaras, reflejo del color y la singularidad cultural de M\u00e9xico.\n\nNo solo eso.

Inconfundible por su color plata en la m\u00e1scara, la capa y las botas, fue duramente criticado a lo largo de su trayectoria, ya que muchos los calificaban de salvaje y rudo al momento de luchar.\n\nOtro luchador ic\u00f3nico fue Blue Demon (demonio azul), quien hizo de este color su sello distintivo. Blue Demon tuvo, adem\u00e1s, una rivalidad hist\u00f3rica con el Santo, y muchos lo consideraban mejor luchador.

Fighting ended with an armistice signed on November 11, 1918.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and other world leaders are gathering in Paris this weekend to commemorate the armistice and remember those who died.\n\nAssociated Press photographer Laurent Rebours recently visited sites across the former Western Front and took pictures, comparing the scenes now to what they look liked in 1918. The \"before\" photos below came from the US National World War I Museum and Memorial:\n\nRead More", "Darren Byler is a lecturer in sociocultural anthropology at the University of Washington in the US. His research focuses on Uyghur dispossession and culture. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) Over the past two years, news of the mass detention of Muslim-majority Uyghurs has slowly filtered out of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Western China.\n\nThese reports have coalesced into the outlines of a nightmarish system of massive prison camps and AI-enabled surveillance systems. Uyghurs, a group of nearly 11 million people who are native to Central Asia, have come to refer to themselves as a \"people destroyed.\"\n\nChinese authorities have described their project to re-engineer Uyghur society as a response to religious \"extremism\" and the threat of terrorism. In the absence of a free press, stories of violent attacks by Uyghurs have been amplified far beyond all evidence of resistance to state control.\n\nUp to one million Uyghurs are estimated to be imprisoned inside the camps, according to the scholar Adrian Zenz and Human Rights Watch. Beijing denies the camps are detention centers and instead claims they are \"vocational training centers,\" which students are happy to attend.\n\nAmid the growing outrage over the camps around the world, more than one million government workers, mostly members of China's ethnic Han majority, have been quietly sent to Uyghur homes to monitor and assess Uyghur resistance to this process.\n\nThese \"relatives,\" as they have been trained to call themselves, are part of an effort to fully assimilate the Uyghur population by undermining things as basic as religion and language, family structure and food culture.\n\nReports of the home stay system published in state media said the visits would \"enhance ethnic unity,\" with pictures posted of Communist Party members posing smiling with Uyghur families.\n\nWhen I visited the region in April 2018 I met a number of these Han civil servants. I asked them to tell me about their work and what they thought about it.\n\nThrough my research I found that these \"relatives\" have been given two major tasks when they arrive in Uyghur homes. Their first priority is fact finding. They are tasked with uncovering religious and ethnic nationalist attitudes. They also attempt to understand the loyalties Uyghurs have to family members that have been detained.\n\nThe manual that is used by \"relatives\" in Kashgar prefecture advocates asking Uyghur children questions regarding sensitive issues since \"they will tell the truth.\" The information they gleaned through this process is then entered into digital security systems, where higher-level authorities determine who should be sent to the camp system.\n\nThe second priority for the \"relatives\" is what they refer to as \"showing warmth\" or care to Uyghurs.\n\nIn echoes of American military attempts to \"win the hearts and minds\" of Afghans and Iraqis in the first decade of a related \"War on Terror,\" this approach centers on showing sympathy regarding Uyghur living circumstances and asking questions regarding things that would improve their lives.\n\nPhoto taken on July 2, 2018, shows a man walking past a wall bearing a China Communist Party slogan in Kashgar.\n\nOf course, this form of care does not include extending sympathy for missing and detained family members. The manual they used in Kashgar Prefecture warned against this. It told them to be careful not to be \"brainwashed\" into sympathizing with Uyghur families.\n\nI found that it was difficult for the majority of the civil servants I spoke with to place themselves in the position of the Uyghurs whose lives and society they were destroying. They saw the type of violent paternalism they were engaged in as necessary to find a solution to what they called the \"Xinjiang problem.\"\n\nMany of them believed that dominating all aspects of Uyghur life was the only way to move forward with the project of the Chinese nation.\n\nGeorge Orwell has argued that when people come to believe in the necessity of their dominance they often become obsessed with disrespect on the part of others. Their domination needs to be loved. In such a state, Orwell notes, \"actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them.\"\n\nUnder such conditions outrages such as imprisonment without trial, the removal of children and the occupation of minority homes are viewed as normal and necessary.\n\nMany of the Han civilians who were involved in the broad Uyghur reeducation effort, particularly the most recent arrivals in Xinjiang, told me that they saw themselves as building a kind of secular Han nationalism. And this impulse, combined with the totalitarian control of the Chinese leadership, made the question of the ethics of the camp system an even harder question to ask.\n\nFor them it was easier to say that in the end this painful, yet banal, process would be a long-term benefit to Xinjiang's Uyghurs and Kazakhs -- another Muslim ethnic minority in the region. After all, through this process Xinjiang would become secular and safe for Han people.\n\nMany \"relatives\" believed they had sacrificed their time and energy in reeducating Muslims, and in return they believed they deserve to be embraced by their Uyghur and Kazakh \"little brothers and sisters.\" They were not able to think about the effects of what they are doing from the perspective of their Muslim neighbors.\n\nAs Hannah Arendt observed decades ago about systems of mass oppression elsewhere, the banality of Uyghur unfreedom was simply a product of those in power \"doing their jobs.\" Until Han \"relatives\" can confront what they have been forced to enact, resistance to the state-directed human engineering project in Xinjiang will remain unthinkable.", "And no, my \"caps lock\" key wasn't accidentally on. (OR WAS IT?)\n\nWe had a national midterm election in which Democrats retook control of the House for the first time in almost a decade. (And Republicans padded their Senate majority.) And yet, within hours, that story -- which is a MASSIVE story -- was pushed out of the headlines by two more:\n\n1) President Donald Trump held an almost 90-minute post-election press conference in which he feuded with reporters, ran down members of his own party who didn't embrace him fully and lost and opened the door for the possibility of working across the aisle with House Democrats.\n\n2) Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replaced him with Sessions' chief of staff, Matt Whitaker . Whitaker, who is now the acting attorney general, is now ostensibly in charge of the Russia interference probe being run by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nSo. In the space of 36 hours, we had a national election with HUGE political and policy consequences, an absolutely bananas press conference by the President and the removal of the nation's top cop. Even by Trumpian standards, that's one hell of a day and a half.\n\nAs often happens with Trump, the media -- not to mention the political world -- struggled to decide what mattered most. Was it the President's party losing one chamber of Congress -- and all that means (increased oversight, investigations and the like)? Or was it Trump seizing control of the Mueller investigation by putting a loyalist who has expressed skepticism about the Mueller probe in charge of said probe? What about Trump accusing a black reporter of asking a \"racist\" question? Or taking away a CNN reporter's media pass to cover the White House? Or how about the likelihood of recounts in Florida's Senate and governor's races even as Trump tweeted suggesting that Democrats were meddling in the vote?\n\nThe Point : Trump does this. He puts 20 pounds of news in a 5-pound bag and sees how things shake out.\n\nThe week in 23 headlines:\n\nMonday:\n\nTuesday:\n\nWednesday:\n\nThursday:\n\nFriday:", "Washington (CNN) When things were particularly bad between President Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general's chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, would attend White House meetings in his place.\n\nBut Sessions did not know that Whitaker at the same time was angling for a promotion.\n\nWhitaker, who was installed at the Justice Department by powerful White House allies, \"spoke and behaved like he was attorney general,\" a source with knowledge of the meetings said.\n\nWednesday, Whitaker got the job when Trump made him acting attorney general.\n\nTrump's move puts Whitaker in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. It has also created new controversies, with legal experts debating about the legality of the appointment and news stories featuring his past criticisms of Mueller and defense of Trump.\n\nThe transformation of Sessions from influential early backer of Trump's improbable presidential campaign to frequent target of the President's scorn is a study in the fickleness of political alliances in Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, the attorney general received the call everyone in Washington knew was coming some day soon.\n\nJohn Kelly, the White House chief of staff, asked Sessions to submit his resignation, according to multiple sources briefed on the call. Sessions agreed to comply, but he wanted a few more days before the resignation would become effective. Kelly said he'd consult the President.\n\nSoon, the sources say, top Justice officials convened on the 5th floor suite of offices for the attorney general. Eventually, there were two huddles in separate offices. Among those in Sessions' office was Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, his deputy Ed O'Callaghan, Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Steven Engel, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nA few yards away, Whitaker strategized with other aides, including Gary Barnett, now his chief of staff.\n\nThe rival huddles, which haven't been previously reported, laid bare a break in the relationship between Sessions and Whitaker that had emerged in recent weeks, after it became clear that Whitaker played a behind-the-scenes role in an aborted effort to oust Rosenstein.\n\nA source close to Sessions says that the former attorney general realized that Whitaker was \"self-dealing\" after reports surfaced in September that Whitaker had spoken with Kelly and had discussed plans to become the No. 2 at the Justice Department if Rosenstein was forced to resign.\n\nIn recent months, with his relationship with the President at a new low, Sessions skipped several so-called principals meetings that he was slated to attend as a key member of the Cabinet. A source close to Sessions says that neither the attorney general nor Trump thought it was a good idea for Sessions to be at the White House, so he sent surrogates. Whitaker was one of them.\n\nBut Sessions did not realize Whitaker was having conversations with the White House about his future until the news broke in late September about Rosenstein.\n\nOn Wednesday as aides began drafting Sessions' resignation letter, the distrust for Whitaker burst into the open.\n\nThe fact that Whitaker would become acting attorney general, passing over Rosenstein suddenly raised concerns about the impact on the most high-profile investigation in the Justice Department, the Russia probe led by Mueller. The Mueller probe has been at the center of Trump's ire directed at Sessions and the Justice Department. Whitaker has made comments criticizing Mueller's investigation and Rosenstein's oversight of it, and has questioned the allegations of Russian interference.\n\nRosenstein and O'Callaghan, the highest-ranked officials handling day-to-day oversight of Mueller's investigation, urged Sessions to delay the effective date of his resignation.\n\nSoon, Whitaker strode into Sessions' office and asked to speak one-on-one to the attorney general; the others left the two men alone. It was a brief conversation. Shortly after, Sessions told his huddle that his resignation would be effective that day.\n\nO'Callaghan had tried to appeal to Sessions, noting that he hadn't heard back about whether the President would allow a delay. At least one Justice official in the room mentioned that there would be legal questions about whether Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general is constitutional. Someone also reminded Sessions that the last time Whitaker played a role in a purported resignation -- a few weeks earlier in September, with Rosenstein -- the plan collapsed.\n\nSessions never heard in person from the President -- the man who gained television fame for his catch-phrase \"You're fired\" doesn't actually like such confrontation and prefers to have others do the firing, people close to the President say. Kelly called Sessions a second time to tell him the President had rejected his request for a delay.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment for this story.\n\nJUST WATCHED Despite denial, Trump said last month he knows Whitaker Replay More Videos ...

Sessions interviewed him and the two grew to have a good working relationship. Sessions liked him, but even if he didn't, the plan was already hatched for him to take the role, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n\nLeonard Leo, the influential executive vice president of the Federalist Society, recommended to then-White House counsel Don McGahn that Whitaker would make a good chief of staff for Sessions.\n\n\"I recommended him and was very supportive of him for chief of staff for very specific reasons,\" Leo said Friday.\n\n\"Jeff Sessions needed a reliable conservative, a strong manager, and someone who had credibility who had previously served the department,\" he added. \"Whitaker was a very good former US attorney and is a very good manager. He's a no-nonsense, get-it-done kind of guy.\"\n\nWhitaker, a 49-year-old former U.S. attorney from Iowa and former CNN contributor, is a gregarious imposing presence that fits his former life as college football tight end. His Twitter feed, which he made private in recent days, shows a picture of him weightlifting, a passion he complains he doesn't get as much time to enjoy these days.\n\nOn Thursday, his first full day as acting attorney general, and with criticism of his appointment beginning to swirl, he tried to exude a calm demeanor. He convened a late afternoon meeting with senior department officials. He kept remarks brief, saying he was proud to lead them, that they've been doing good work and to keep doing what they're doing. Another call, also brief, with US attorneys around the country followed.\n\nOn Friday, he sent his first department-wide message, thanking Sessions for his service and extolling the work of colleagues around the country. \"As we move forward, I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\" Whitaker wrote.\n\nSessions' last day\n\nThe ignominious end to Sessions' tenure is a far cry from the early days of the 2016 campaign, when he became an eager surrogate. Sessions' hardline views on immigration became suffused in the rhetoric that Trump adopted.\n\nSessions was the first US senator to endorse Trump at a time when establishment Republicans were still staying away, and he left his safe Alabama Senate seat to take the attorney general job.\n\nSeveral members of his staff also joined the President's team, helping to craft some of the harsh immigration policies that Sessions often preached from Capitol Hill and which have become a cornerstone of stump speeches that Trump regularly uses to excite his political base.\n\nBut months into the job, Trump had soured on Sessions for the sin of recusing himself from the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and possible connections to the Trump campaign.\n\nMore recently, Sessions appeared at peace with the prospect of being ousted from office. He made a series of valedictory visits with law enforcement around the country, seeking to underline what he believes will be his legacy of strong support for law enforcement and efforts to reduce crime.\n\nSessions spent Election Day on Tuesday surrounded by what he loves: cops and sweets.\n\nHe visited the FBI's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, where officials warmly greeted him and provided a briefing on their latest capabilities.\n\nOver a plate of Milano cookies, he was an engaged questioner asking a scientist about DNA identification and how it has affected guilty pleas in court.\n\nLater, when he arrived in the cafeteria for lunch, a room full of FBI personnel and local police officers training in the National Academy rose to their feet as he entered the room.

Steny Hoyer, who currently holds the position of No. 2 House Democrat as minority whip, has launched a bid to become the majority leader in the next Congress.\n\nLike Pelosi, Hoyer is a veteran of House Democratic leadership. The Maryland Democrat has served as second-highest ranking Democrat after Pelosi for 16 years and in lower-level Democratic leadership positions even longer.\n\nThe majority leader is responsible for managing the schedule that determines when legislation will be considered on the House floor and planning the legislative schedule on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. The majority leader also works with committee chairs on policy and to bring bills that have advanced out of committee -- and have the support of leadership and the votes to pass -- to the House floor.\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and Assistant Democratic Leader, is pictured.\n\nMAJORITY WHIP\n\nRep. James Clyburn, who currently holds the No. 3 Democratic leadership spot of assistant Democratic leader, is running for majority whip.\n\nClyburn, a lawmaker from South Carolina, is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, a key voting bloc among House Democrats, and is the highest-ranking African-American member in the House.\n\nDiana DeGette of Colorado, who is currently a member of Rep.of Colorado, who is currently a member of the Democratic whip team serving as a chief deputy whip, is challenging Clyburn for the position.\n\nThe majority whip acts as a key vote counter for party leadership and is tasked with figuring out how much support a particular bill will have if it comes to the floor for a vote. The whip also works to mobilize votes in support of leadership priorities.\n\nASSISTANT DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\nSeveral Democrats are running for assistant Democratic leader, a position in the Democratic leadership hierarchy created after Democrats lost the House to Republicans in the 2010 midterms.\n\nNew Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, is running for the post and so is Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island.\n\nRep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois had been vying for the position as well, but dropped her bid after Luj\u00e1n's entry into the race; she began running instead to lead the campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nCAUCUS CHAIR\n\nHakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, and Rep. Barbara Lee of California, both members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep.a Democrat from New York, and Rep.of California, both members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are competing for the spot of chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nRep. Linda S\u00e1nchez of California had also been running for the spot, but she dropped her bid, citing an \"unexpected family matter\" and later disclosed that her husband had been indicted in Connecticut.\n\nThe position is currently held by Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, but he won't be around in the next Congress after he was defeated in a major upset by progressive primary challenger and political newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nRepublican leadership in the next Congress\n\nMINORITY LEADER\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, the current No. 2 Republican and House majority leader, will be the top Republican leader in the next Congress. McCarthy was picked by House Republicans in a closed-door election held the week after midterms to be the Republican minority leader, taking over from Paul Ryan as the leader of the Republican conference. McCarthy easily defeated Rep. Jim Jordan, the co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who challenged him for the position.\n\nThe position of minority leader is the highest in the House for the party out of power. The minority leader is the most visible face of the minority party in the lower chamber and works to advance the party's objectives, despite being shut out of control of the House -- with the ultimate goal of taking back the chamber.\n\nUS Majority Whip Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, walks through Statuary Hall at the US Capitol in September 2017, as he returns to work after being injured in a shooting at the Republican Congressional baseball team practice earlier that year.\n\nMINORITY WHIP\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, the current No. 3-ranked House Republican, was elected to be the Republican minority whip in the next Congress.\n\nScalise is widely respected among House Republicans and gained a higher national profile after he was shot in a 2017 attack on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice.\n\nThe minority whip acts as a vote counter and also works to mobilize support and votes for or against legislation in line with the goals of party leadership.\n\nRep.

This number is up 378% from last October, which had 4,836 family members apprehended.\n\nCBP first began tracking apprehensions of family members in 2013.\n\nOverall, the number is also continuing to climb, but is not close to a record. The total number of individuals apprehended illegally crossing the southwest border in October were 50,975, up from 41,486 in September and 25,488 last October. Historically, in the early to mid-2000s, there were months when well over 100,000 migrants were apprehended illegally crossing the southern border.\n\nIn October, 4,991 unaccompanied children were apprehended by border patrol along the southern border. Last October, more than 3,100 unaccompanied children were picked up after illegally crossing the southern border.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) After her 15-year-old son ended up \"in critical and life-threatening condition\" from an adenovirus outbreak at a New Jersey health care facility, one mother is suing those who she believes allowed her son to end up in the ICU, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\n\nPaula Costigan's son, William DelGrosso, was one of dozens of medically fragile children who were infected with the virus beginning in late September at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, New Jersey.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, DelGrosso came down with a fever on October 11 and was transferred to the intensive care unit at Hackensack University Medical Center on October 18 with \"serious respiratory complications.\" He is still there now, according to the family's lawyer, Paul da Costa.\n\n\"As a mother, it's hard enough to not have your child under your own roof and have to trust and rely on a facility to care for your child,\" da Costa said, adding that Costigan \"feels as if the facility was trying to hide the fact there was this serious virus spreading like wildfire.\"\n\nThe Wanaque Center declined a request for comment on the lawsuit.\n\n'Kids like William'\n\nCostigan doesn't know where her son will go when he's stable enough to be discharged from intensive care, da Costa said.\n\nDelGrosso, who has a seizure disorder, has required a ventilator to breathe since he was about 10 years old, when he went into cardiac arrest after a major seizure, da Costa said.\n\nThere are four long-term care facilities in New Jersey that cater to children, according to a state health department database. This includes the Wanaque Center and the Voorhees Pediatric Facility, where seven kids have been infected with a milder strain of adenovirus, according to the state health department. There have been no deaths among the Voorhees patients.\n\nCostigan doesn't want her son to go back to the Wanaque facility, but she's been told that the other centers in the state that accept Medicaid and are equipped to take care of a ventilator-dependent child like her son may have up to a one-year wait list, according to da Costa.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the facility neglected to provide the care DelGrosso needed when it came to preventing such an infection from spreading.\n\n\"At the time of the initial case of adenovirus,\" the lawsuit alleges, the facility \"did not have proper infection prevention and control programs, protocols, or procedures in place to remedy the infection and prevent it from spreading throughout its pediatric residents.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that the facility didn't send patients to acute care hospitals in a timely manner or notify parents earlier, around the time when it first contacted the state health department about the outbreak, on October 9.\n\nCostigan told da Costa that \"she was never informed that her son had high fevers several days before they ultimately told her that he needed to be transferred immediately to an acute care hospital\" on October 18, he said. And she wasn't notified about the adenovirus outbreak until a form letter arrived in the mail four days later, he added.\n\nIn statements last month, the Wanaque facility said that it's working alongside health experts to investigate the outbreak and that it \"promptly notified all appropriate government agencies when the virus was initially identified.\" The facility did not respond to earlier requests for further comment.\n\nDa Costa says the lawsuit isn't just about Costigan's son; it's about \"kids like William who have the inability to speak for themselves and to care for themselves.\"\n\nThe lawsuit references health inspections dating back several years, including an unannounced inspection on October 21 that found deficient hand hygiene practices among staff. This inspection was conducted after health officials had been alerted by the facility but before the health department publicly announced any deaths.\n\nThe facility has received and corrected other deficiencies in the past, including improperly stored syringes, which were used to measure liquid medication, and over-bed tables and medication trays that were not properly cleaned and disinfected.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last month, New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal described these as \"low-level, self-limited deficiencies\" that were resolved when health inspectors rechecked.\n\nIn a review by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Wanaque Center was awarded an above-average ranking in overall quality but a below-average health inspection rating. The rating is based on two years of inspections before November 2017. The Wanaque facility's deficiencies have consistently been lower in number than the US average.\n\n\"It is rare that in any inspection a facility would come out with no citations,\" Elnahal said. \"If it's a number of citations, all of which are low-level, we ask for a plan of correction. We make sure the facility follows through -- and that's what this facility did here.\n\n\"If the findings are severe enough to take further action, we will,\" he added.\n\nThe infections and deaths come amid questions -- from former Wanaque Center employees , the mother of one of the children who died, and Elnahal himself -- about whether current facility standards are high enough and whether more could have been done to prevent this from happening.\n\nElnahal previously said in a statement that the findings of the most recent health inspection at the Wanaque facility \"raise questions about whether these general longterm care standards are optimal for this vulnerable population of medically fragile children.\"\n\n\"We also need to think about whether there is more we can do as healthcare leaders to protect immunocompromised children, such as those served at Wanaque Center,\" he said.\n\n\"Every year in the state, there are hundreds of outbreaks at healthcare facilities.\"\n\n'We are taking aggressive steps'\n\nAdenoviruses are often spread by touching a contaminated person or surface, or through the air by coughing or sneezing. They are known to persist on unclean surfaces and medical instruments for long periods of time, and they may not be eliminated by common disinfectants, but they rarely cause severe illness in healthy people.\n\nHowever, people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk for severe disease, and they may remain contagious long after they recover, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSymptoms may appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus.\n\nAt the Wanaque facility, the patients with confirmed cases became ill between September 26 and November 8, according to the health department. The number has risen from 18 cases, including six deaths, announced last month by the health department.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe outbreak in the Wanaque facility was caused by adenovirus type 7. This type is \"most commonly associated with acute respiratory disease,\" according to the CDC. Other types of adenovirus infections can cause flu-like symptoms, pinkeye and diarrhea.\n\nHealth officials say they are stepping up efforts to strengthen infection control at such facilities in the state. The health department announced plans last week to deploy a team of infection control experts to visit University Hospital and four pediatric long-term care facilities this month, including the Wanaque and Voorhees facilities, where experts will train staff and evaluate how these facilities prevent and control infections.\n\n\"Facility outbreaks are not always preventable, but in response to what we have seen in Wanaque, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the chance they occur among the most vulnerable patients in New Jersey,\" Elnahal said in a statement last week.\n\nThe facility has been \"instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends and they are in full compliance,\" according to the state health department. State health officials have said the outbreak can be declared over only when four weeks pass without an additional case.\n\n\"It can be difficult to impossible to know how the virus got to the facility, what its source was, or what its specific mechanism of spread is from person to person,\" Elnahal said.", "(CNN) Sarah Jessica Parker's latest film asks moviegoers to reflect on finality.\n\nIn \"Here and Now,\" Parker plays Vivienne, a singer who is diagnosed with an incurable form of cancer.

As a result, in consultation with the United States, the Coalition has requested cessation of inflight refueling support for its operations in Yemen,\" the statement said.\n\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis also confirmed the decision in a statement issued later on Friday.\n\n\"We support the decision by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, after consultations with the US Government, to use the Coalition's own military capabilities to conduct inflight refueling in support of its operations in Yemen,\" Mattis said.\n\nHe said that the US and the Saudis were \"focused on supporting resolution of the conflict, led by UN Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths\" and that \"the US and the Coalition are planning to collaborate on building up legitimate Yemeni forces to defend the Yemeni people, secure their country's borders, and contribute to counter Al Qaeda and ISIS efforts in Yemen and the region.\"\n\nWhile the refueling has not stopped yet, the Pentagon and Saudis are going to announce it together to head off pending legislation, a diplomatic source confirms to CNN.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report the plan to stop the aerial refueling.\n\nThe Trump administration has been criticized by humanitarian groups and some members of Congress for its support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen and for the administration's recent finding that the coalition was doing enough to avoid civilian casualties.\n\nIn addition to aerial refueling, the US military provides the Saudi coalition with training meant to help minimize civilian casualties as well as with intelligence to help guard against Houthi cross-border missile and drone attacks.\n\nMattis confirmed in his statement that those support activities would go on, saying the US will \"continue working with the Coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country.\"\n\nMattis said last month that the goal of that training was \"to achieve a level of capability by those forces fighting against the Houthis, that they are not killing innocent people.\"\n\nBut many Democrats in Congress are seeking to cut US support for the Saudi-led coalition and Democrats in the House have introduced a bill that would put a stop to that assistance.\n\nA Democratic House aide told CNN that while they are optimistic the bill will be passed in the lame duck session, the fact that the Democrats took control of the House in the midterm elections has bolstered the chance of it passing soon.\n\nThe bill is co-sponsored by Democrats who are viewed as likely to be taking critical committee chairmanships in the next Congress, including Rep. Adam Smith from the House Armed Services Committee and Rep. Eliot Engel from the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nThe bill would not affect US military activities aimed at countering the Yemen-based affiliates of ISIS and al Qaeda.\n\nOne of the sponsors of that bill signaled support for the decision to stop aerial refueling of Saudi warplanes, calling it a \"major victory.\"\n\n\"Congress has won a major victory in convincing the administration to end US refueling in the Saudi-led war in Yemen,\" Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CNN in a statement.\n\nKhanna, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, added that Congress needed \"to memorialize and confirm the decision\" by passing the bill \"to ensure that all US involvement is shut off and reclaim congressional authority.\"\n\nA US official told CNN Friday that the Trump administration was weighing designating the Iranian-backed Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a label applied to groups like al Qaeda and Hezbollah.\n\nThe Democratic aide said that the Trump administration's public criticism of the Houthis and its consideration of foreign terrorist organization designation is likely part of an effort to bolster public support for US aid to the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nHe also said that the recent murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul had also caused some members of Congress to take a tougher line on Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut in his remarks last month, Mattis sought to distance the US backing of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen from the killing Khashoggi, an event that he once again condemned, saying the two issues are \"separate.\"\n\nNews of the planned reduction in aid to Saudi Arabia comes the same day as their opponents in the Yemen Civil War, the Houthi Rebels, fired an anti-ship missile into the Red Sea, according to multiple defense officials, a move that comes the same day the Houthi leader rejected the Trump administration's proposal for a ceasefire aimed at ending the civil war.\n\nThe missile was fired from the city of Hodeidah, the last Houthi-controlled port, which is the site of fierce fighting between the Houthis and forces from the Saudi-led international coalition which is allied with Yemen's internationally recognized government. Another official said the missile came from a concealed position inside a vehicle, underscoring the difficulty in targeting.\n\nThe US believes the Houthis receive many of their missiles from their ally Iran, though the rebels have also captured stockpiles that once belonged to the government of Yemen.\n\nA US defense official told CNN that the missile's target was not clear but that there was a Saudi-flagged oil tanker 50 miles off the coast of Hodeidah when it was fired, that vessel is not believed to have been struck. The Red Sea is home to a large amount of shipping, particularly of oil and gas.\n\nThe fighting in and around Hodeidah has sparked concerns that the flow of humanitarian aid to Houthi-controlled areas could be interrupted and the UN has warned that millions of Yemenis face the risk of starvation should that aid be cut off.\n\nLate last month, Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition to embrace a ceasefire within 30 days, asking the Houthis to first cease their missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE and for the Saudi-led coalition to subsequently halt airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nHowever, Houthi leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi appeared to reject the terms of the US proposal on Friday, saying the recent US statements on a ceasefire were \"trying to mislead the world.\"\n\n\"The United States has the clout to bring an end to the conflict \u2014 but it has decided to protect a corrupt ally,\" al-Houthi wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post that was published Friday.\n\nHe accused the US of \"participating and sometimes leading the aggression in Yemen\" and rejected the US terms for a ceasefire that would begin with the Houthis halting their missile attacks.\n\n\"We are ready to stop the missiles if the Saudi-led coalition stops its airstrikes,\" he wrote.", "Los Angeles (CNN) Facebook said Friday that it will no longer require employees to resolve sexual harassment claims in arbitration.\n\nThe policy change comes one day after Google said it would stop forcing employees into arbitration over sexual harassment and assault claims following mass employee walkouts over how the company has handled the issues in the past.\n\nA spokesperson for Facebook confirmed to CNN Business that it is \"amending its arbitration agreements to make arbitration a choice rather than a requirement in sexual harassment claims.

Let's blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!\" Trump told his followers on Twitter at the beginning of a seven-message tear that repeatedly alleged election fraud\n\nTrump this time was taking a cue from Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who wants to maintain his lead in the Senate race there and who on Thursday accused Democrats of fraud and trying to \"steal\" the election.\n\nBut as CNN's Dan Merica and Ryan Nobles reported Friday , the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is not actively investigating any matters related to Tuesday's election, a department spokesperson said Friday, after it was informed by the Florida Department of State that there have been no allegations of criminal activity.\n\nIt's not the first time the President has complained about US elections, even the one he won. In 2016, he complained before Election Day that the process was rigged. Afterward, he repeatedly alleged, also without evidence, that millions of fraudulently cast ballots had cost him the popular vote. There's not now and there never has been any evidence of any sort of large-scale voter fraud.\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks with reporters before departing for France on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nRegarding Arizona, Trump seemed to argue for an entire new election after the state Republican Party challenged the way the state verifies voter signatures for mail-in ballots dropped off at polling places.\n\n\"Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nRepublicans have seen their leads in the Florida US Senate and governor's races dwindle as new ballots have been counted since Election Day, and in Arizona, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema has pulled ahead.\n\nThe Arizona state Republican Party has gone to court to challenge how signatures for mail-in ballots are being verified, which drew a public rebuke from Sen. John McCain's widow, Cindy McCain.\n\n\"@AZGOP I am one of those mail in ballots. I was under the impression my vote was always counted.\" she said on Twitter\n\nRepublicans' control of the Senate is not in question, but margins are everything, and both parties want as many seats as possible.\n\nIt should be noted that with his tweets, Trump is calling to end the election without counting every vote in Florida, where his favored candidate is ahead, and seems to want an entirely new election in Arizona, where his candidate is behind.\n\nThere were many close races, particularly out West, in which votes counted after Election Day have helped Democrats. In Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester was behind when Americans went to bed on Election Day, but pulled ahead and has since won his bid for re-election.\n\nA judge sided with Scott on Friday and demanded that the Broward County elections supervisor disclose the number of ballots cast by 7 p.m. ET. She said that'll slow down the counting even further.\n\nIn Arizona, where the vast majority of voters cast ballots by mail and which allows for mail-in voting or for voters to drop off mail-in ballots at polling places, the count has taken longer. Sinema did not pull ahead of Republican Rep. Martha McSally until Thursday.\n\nAs of this writing, only 83% of the Arizona vote is expected to be in.\n\nIn California, where absentee voting is open to all voters, mail-in ballots must be postmarked by Election Day and received within three days of Election Day. Officials speculated before Election Day that it would take weeks to count all the ballots. That late vote has helped Democrats pull ahead in several House races.\n\nRecalling 2016, this vote lag is how Hillary Clinton continued to grow her popular vote lead over Trump long after it was clear on Election Day that she had lost the Electoral College and thus the election. Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican, wasn't declared the winner of his race until after Thanksgiving in 2016. This year he's retiring and his seat was won by a Democrat.\n\nThe situation in Florida is different, as officials in Broward County, which along with Palm Beach was at the center of the infamous 2000 presidential recount, continue to process ballots while the rest of the state has finished. Republicans have griped about the situation in part because the process has taken longer than state law allows and also because the vote from Broward heavily favors Democrats.\n\n\"As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don't worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\" Trump tweeted\n\nVote counting in Florida has routinely taken a long time -- witness the 2000 and even the 2012 presidential elections.\n\nExplaining why it takes so long, Broward County Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes told reporter Jeff Weinsier of Local 10 News that the length of the ballot and mail-in ballots were to blame.\n\n\"It's a serious issue with me,\" she said. \"I've been doing this now since October 22.\"\n\n\"We ran 22 sites, we ran 14 days, we ran 12 hours, we had a big vote by mail, so don't try to turn it around to make it seem like I'm making comedy out of this,\" Snipes said.\n\nRegardless, the margins in both the Senate and governor's races there are in machine recount territory, which means no resolution in the coming days.\n\nLong recounts are nothing new in the US. In 2008, Sen. Norm Coleman was ahead on election night, but in a recount that lasted months, Democrat Al Franken pulled ahead of the Minnesota Republican and ultimately won.\n\nAdding to all of this is the fact that American elections are conducted differently in each state. In some places they're weeks-long affairs when early voting is factored in. More than 33 million Americans voted before Election Day in 2018, according to pre-election data given to CNN by the data research firm Catalist.", "Suzanne Roberts is a poet, travel writer and memoirist.

(North Korea ranked closely behind.) The bank's top cybersecurity executive said his team is bracing for a reprisal, because Iran \"might lash out\" as a result of the reimposed sanctions.\n\nThe bank requested not to be identified, citing a concern that Iran would single it out and direct hackers to attack the institution. The industry as a whole is already on guard, the bank said.\n\nUnited States Cyber Command, the hacking force within the Department of Defense, said it is working along with other government efforts to counter \"malicious cyber activity.\"\n\n\"Iran, while more limited (than some other countries) in the sophistication of their cyber capabilities, (has) demonstrated a greater willingness to conduct destructive cyberattacks that are well beyond the norms of state behavior in peacetime,\" Lt. Col. Audricia Harris told CNN in an email.\n\nCompanies in the private sector may experience attacks first. Two former federal government officials and several cybersecurity experts confirmed to CNN that major American banks are concerned about Iranian retaliation, though the banks themselves declined to comment.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration reimposed all the economic penalties that the Obama administration lifted as part of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. The reinstated sanctions added almost 700 targets to the US sanctions list, including 50 Iranian financial institutions, making it harder for these targets to engage in business worldwide. The Iranian government has made public statements about its intention to defy US sanctions.\n\nAn industry of private security contractors has grown up to protect major banks and other companies from hackers. They have recently warned their clients to heighten their defenses.\n\n\"Banks are taking a hard look at Iranian threat actors right now. We've advised all of our clients in the critical infrastructure space to consider the historic hostile actions of Iranian actors given this new development,\" said John Hultquist, director of research at FireEye, a cybersecurity firm that provides services to major banks.\n\nThe banking industry's privately run group that coordinates defenses against cyberattacks -- the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center -- told CNN it has not seen Iran prepare to attack yet.\n\n\"There's no evidence I've seen that the threat is imminent,\" FS-ISAC CEO Bill Nelson told CNN on Wednesday. \"But we were able to effectively defend and respond in 2012. We're certainly better off than we were then.\"\n\nAccording to public accusations made two years ago by the Department of Justice, Iran launched massive cyberattacks against the US banking sector from 2011 until 2013. Iranian hackers flooded American financial institutions with garbage computer traffic, jamming the banks' internet services. The attacks started in December 2011 then ramped up in September 2012, when it significantly disrupted customer access to the websites of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, US Bank and PNC Bank.\n\nAt the time, the cyberattack was the largest ever. The cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike called it \"unprecedented.\" The Obama administration's DOJ later indicted seven Iranians who allegedly conducted the cyberattack while working at two companies \"on behalf\" of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nJoshua Motta saw those attacks firsthand while he worked at Cloudflare, an internet service that protects websites from these kinds of aggressive floods of traffic. At the time, he said, \"the industry was unprepared.\" He's now CEO of the cyberinsurance company Coalition, which provides coverage for small businesses like credit unions and regional banks. Motta said they should be preparing for Iran's vengeance.\n\n\"This is on everyone's radar. It is almost with 100% certainty the hacking campaign will resume after sanctions,\" Motta told CNN this week. \"And I don't think it's going to be limited to banks.\" Energy infrastructure, for example, could also come under threat, as it did from Russia earlier this year , according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIf Iran does attack the United States, corporations will be faced with hackers whose skills have grown since 2012, according to CrowdStrike.\n\n\"They've gotten better in the last six years at intrusion activity. The experience they've gained -- launching wave after wave of destructive attacks against Saudi Arabia -- has helped them increase their capabilities. They are much more formidable,\" said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike's co-founder and chief technology officer.\n\nSince the 2011-2013 Iranian cyberattacks, the US military has taken a more aggressive position against such threats -- one that could result in an immediate counterstrike against Iran.\n\nAs CNN reported in September , the US military has been given more authority to launch preventative cyberattacks. A classified Obama administration directive that forced American government hackers to seek the president's approval before launching retaliatory cyberstrikes deemed to have \"significant consequences\" was replaced by the Trump administration's National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, or NSPM 13.\n\nPresident Trump's directive, which came into effect September 20, \"effectively reversed those restraints\" put into place by the previous President, White House national security adviser John Bolton told reporters at the time . \"Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration,\" he said.\n\n\"It is now the policy of the United States to shoot back to deter (an) adversary's cyber operations. If we could get into their network, we could destroy their computers. We could take down the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps network affecting the banks,\" said Jason Healey, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's School for International and Public Affairs who is working on a paper about the more aggressive policy and its potential consequences.\n\nThis more aggressive cyberwarfare policy carries a risk of escalating tensions, Healey and other experts said. But Healey acknowledged the tensions with Iran are there already.\n\nUS Cyber Command, the military's hackers, \"want to get in there and grapple, get close and throw elbows, make the adversaries fight for their computer infrastructure,\" Healey said.", "(CNN) Seventeen black women made history Tuesday night in winning judicial seats in Harris County, Texas.\n\nThe 17 Democratic candidates were elected under a campaign they called \"Black Girl Magic Texas,\" hoping to be the largest number of black women elected judges in Harris County.\n\nHarris County, which includes Houston, is the largest county in the state.\n\nSome of the women celebrated their success on social media.\n\n\"This election is still sinking in,\" LaShawn Williams, judge-elect for one of the county civil courts at law, wrote on Facebook . \"I am speechless and overjoyed by all of your kind words and powerful actions to help us make a court system which ensures that everyone will be heard.\"\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Control of the company is on the line.\n\nAfter months of fighting for a new board , Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point now wants to replace just five ofits12 members. The move comes at a critical time: Next week, proxy advisory firms are expected to outline their recommendations on how shareholders should vote. The new pitch could help put the firms in Third Point's camp.\n\nSince the summer, Third Point and Campbell Soup have been locked in a vicious proxy fight. Third Point, disappointed in Campbell's management, has sued the company and lobbed several attacks on members of the board. Campbell, which wants to keep control, has fired back and dismissed the hedge fund's grievances.\n\nThird Point came to the decision to reduce its slate of nominees after speaking with other investors, the hedge fund wrote in a letter to Les Vinney, chairman of Campbell Soup ( CPB ), on Friday.\n\nShareholders \"believe that some continuity is a good thing,\" Third Point wrote, adding that investors have said \"change is necessary to reverse decades of underperformance.\"\n\n\"We now understand that the Short Slate is exactly what is needed to set Campbell on a sustainable path to renewed competitiveness and growth,\" Third Point wrote.\n\nCampbell's interim CEO Keith McLoughlin sent his own letter to shareholders in response, saying that Campbell has its own plans to refresh the board.\n\n\"We currently have a list of about a dozen candidates who we are considering for any upcoming vacancies, including vacancies due to three planned retirements occurring over the next three years,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Campbell has had \"proactive conversations\" with Third Point and that Campbell even offered to add two of the five proposed board members, Sarah Hofstetter, who worked on Oreo and Oscar Mayer ad campaigns, and Kurt Schmidt, former Gerber CEO, after the upcoming shareholder meeting.\n\n\"Third Point rejected this proposal,\" he said. \"Instead, they have decided to continue this wasteful and distracting proxy fight.\" McLoughlin said that the offer stands.\n\nLoeb, a billionaire who has a history of taking stakes in major companies and demanding change, holds about 7% of Campbell through Third Point. He has said that the soup company should put itself up for sale. But the company's management want to decide the fate of the 149-year-old company itself.\n\nThird Point has always had a difficult battle: Descendant board members hold about 41% of the company, according to data from Refinitiv. Third Point has cited support from another descendant shareholder who controls nearly 3%, in addition to its own stake.\n\nLoeb's decision to reduce the slate of nominees is a smart one, said Charles Elson, director of the center for corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \"He increases his chances by reducing his numbers.\"\n\nBy nominating a full slate of new members, Third Point is promising shareholders that it has the answer to Campbell's problems, Elson said. But by recommending a minority slate, Third Point is putting the onus on Campbell to get its house in order.\n\nAnd proxy advisers are \"very reluctant to hand over control of the board, let alone the full board, to a minority shareholder absent extraordinary circumstances,\" said Kai Liekefett, a partner at the law firm Sidley Austin who leads Sidley's shareholder activism practice.\n\nAdvisory firms will sometimes recommend a split vote in favor of some current board members and some new ones, said Nicole Boyson, a finance professor at Northeastern University's D'Amore-McKim business school.\n\nThird Point may be betting that a short slate could win a full endorsement, she said. But a split decision could also lead to a settlement. \"When the proxy firm splits, both sides can claim victory,\" she said.\n\nCampbell's annual shareholder meeting, where investors will vote on how to move forward, is scheduled for November 29. \"This is a really critical time,\" said Jian Huang, an assistant professor in the department of finance at Towson University.", "New York (CNN Business) An ex-Goldman Sachs banker who pleaded guilty to conspiring to steal money from Malaysia's state investment fund said Goldman's \"culture\" encouraged executives to work around the legal team to score business.\n\nIt was \"very much in line of its culture of Goldman Sachs to conceal facts from certain compliance and legal employees,\" said Tim Leissner, Goldman's former Southeast Asia chairman, in his guilty plea from August, which was unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn Friday.\n\nLeissner admitted that he hid from Goldman the fact that Malaysian financier Jho Low secured business for the bank by bribing officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. The US government alleges Low played a central role in a scheme to launder billions of dollars from the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad.\n\nLast week, the US Justice Department announced charges against Leissner, Low and Roger Ng , another former Goldman banker. The agency said that Leissner would forfeit $43.7 million.\n\nThe bank in 2012 and 2013 arranged three bond offerings for the 1MDB fund that raised about $6.5 billion, according to the court documents. The bank made about $600 million for its work, the Justice Department said.\n\nMore than $2.7 billion from those offerings was siphoned off, with the knowledge of Leissner and Ng, to bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, according to the indictments. Leissner and Ng are said to have worked around internal legal and compliance controls at Goldman Sachs to make sure the deals would go through.\n\nThe business culture at Goldman \"was highly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper orientation of its compliance functions,\" especially in Southeast Asia, government prosecutors said in their indictment of Low and Ng unsealed last week.\n\nThe legal team at Goldman had raised concerns about Low in the past, the indictment said.\n\nA Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the firm continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating the matter.\n\nNg was arrested last week in Malaysia, according to the Justice Department, and has not yet entered a plea. He could not be reached for comment. Low, who maintains his innocence, remains at large. A spokesperson for his legal team said Low held no formal position at 1MDB and was neither employed by Goldman Sachs nor the governments of Malaysia or Abu Dhabi.\n\nIt's unclear if anyone else at the bank beyond Leissner and Ng knew about Low's involvement in the bond deals.\n\nCEO Lloyd Blankfein, who stepped down from his role atop the bank in October, attended two meetings with Malaysia's former prime minister in 2009 and 2013 that included discussions of 1MDB. Low was present at both meetings, according to the Journal. The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that former Goldman SachsCEO Lloyd Blankfein, who stepped down from his role atop the bank in October, attended two meetings with Malaysia's former prime minister in 2009 and 2013 that included discussions of 1MDB. Low was present at both meetings, according to the Journal.\n\nA source familiar with the matter said that Blankfein had no recollection of meeting Low, and it's unclear if Low was present at the two meetings.\n\nAnother Goldman banker, Andrea Vella, was placed on leave last week, pending a review of alleged conduct related to the 1MDB case. Vella had been demoted from his position as co-head of investment banking in Asia last month.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges a total of $4.5 billion was stolen from the 1MDB fund by high-level officials. US officials claim that laundered funds were pumped into New York condos, hotels, yachts and a jet, and used to fund Hollywood films such as \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump picked a fight with French President Emmanuel Macron over European defense just as Air Force One landed in France on Friday.\n\n\"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly,\" Trump tweeted minutes after landing in France. He is set to spend the weekend in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the end of World War I.\n\nTuesday on Europe 1 radio, Macron called for a \"real European army\" within the European Union, according to AFP\n\n\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\" Macron said.\n\nMacron also suggested that since the start of Trump's presidency, the US has been seen as a less reliable ally.\n\n\"When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,\" he said.\n\nMacron has been advocating a similar position for months.\n\nA senior French official said Friday night that Trump took Macron's words out \"out of context.\"\n\nAccording to the official, Macron will likely want to respond to Trump's tweet directly himself, and likely Saturday.\n\nThe official, though, clarified the language Macron used, saying that the French leader did not mean he wanted a European army but better coordination and funding of Europe's already-existing resources.\n\nThe official said that Macron was conveying that Europe should organize better to protect itself. There is already a European defense project, and Macron would like to see more capability, the official said.\n\n\"Not a European army. He did not mean Europe should form an army,\" the official said. \"And this is all complementary to NATO, not separate from it.\"\n\nFurther strain in Trump-Macron relationship\n\nTrump's tweet on Friday could preview another high-level international meeting in which the US President distances himself from traditional American allies. Unlike the tense G7 summit in June, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be present at this weekend's commemoration.\n\nWhile both Trump and Macron appeared to be off to a warm start following Trump's inauguration, their relationship appears to have soured.\n\nDuring a call about trade and migration in June, sources familiar with the call told CNN that it didn't end well.\n\n\"Just bad. It was terrible,\" a source told CNN . \"Macron thought he would be able to speak his mind, based on the relationship. But Trump can't handle being criticized like that.\"\n\nAnd more recently, a senior diplomatic source told CNN that Trump was \"ranting and venting on trade\" with Macron during their bilateral meeting in September.\n\nThere was \"some rapport\" between the two, \"but it's not what it (once) was,\" the source said.\n\nMacron isn't the only European leader to raise the prospect of Europe doing more for its own defense.\n\nEU President Donald Tusk made a similar suggestion in May after Trump had pulled out of the Iran deal and the Paris climate agreement, threatened a series of trade disputes with Europe and constantly criticized NATO.\n\n\"Europe must do everything in its power to protect, in spite of today's mood, the transatlantic bond. But at the same time we must be prepared for those scenarios, where we will have to act on our own,\" Tusk said.\n\nTusk also said that the EU \"should be grateful\" to Trump \"because, thanks to him, we have got rid of all illusions.\"\n\n\"Looking at the latest decisions of President Trump, someone could even think: With friends like that, who needs enemies?\" Tusk said, later adding, \"He has made us realize that if you need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of your arm.\"", "Bruce Schneier is a security technologist and chief technology officer of IBM Resilient.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion pieces on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Due to ever-evolving technological advances, manufacturers are connecting consumer goods -- from toys to lightbulbs to major appliances -- to the internet at breakneck speeds. This is the Internet of Things, and it's a security nightmare.\n\nThe Internet of Things fuses products with communications technology to make daily life more effortless. Think Amazon's Alexa, which not only answers questions and plays music but allows you to control your home's lights and thermostat. Or the current generation of implanted pacemakers, which can both receive commands and send information to doctors over the internet.\n\nBut like nearly all innovation, there are risks involved. And for products borne out of the Internet of Things, this means the risk of having personal information stolen or devices being overtaken and controlled remotely. For devices that affect the world in a direct physical manner -- cars, pacemakers, thermostats -- the risks include loss of life and property.\n\nBy developing more advanced security features and building them into these products, hacks can be avoided. The problem is that there is no monetary incentive for companies to invest in the cybersecurity measures needed to keep their products secure. Consumers will buy products without proper security features, unaware that their information is vulnerable. And current liability laws make it hard to hold companies accountable for shoddy software security.\n\nIt falls upon lawmakers to create laws that protect consumers. While the US government is largely absent in this area of consumer protection, the state of California has recently stepped in and started regulating the Internet of Things, or \"IoT\" devices sold in the state -- and the effects will soon be felt worldwide.\n\nCalifornia's new SB 327 law , which will take effect in January 2020, requires all \"connected devices\" to have a \"reasonable security feature.\" The good news is that the term \"connected devices\" is broadly defined to include just about everything connected to the internet. The not-so-good news is that \"reasonable security\" remains defined such that companies trying to avoid compliance can argue that the law is unenforceable.\n\nThe legislation requires that security features must be able to protect the device and the information on it from a variety of threats and be appropriate to both the nature of the device and the information it collects. California's attorney general will interpret the law and define the specifics, which will surely be the subject of much lobbying by tech companies.\n\nThere's just one specific in the law that's not subject to the attorney general's interpretation: Default passwords are not allowed. his is a good thing; they are a terrible security practice. But it's just one of dozens of awful \"security\" measures commonly found in IoT devices.\n\nThis law is not a panacea . But we have to start somewhere, and it is a start.\n\nThough the legislation covers only the state of California, its effects will reach much further. All of us -- in the United States or elsewhere -- are likely to benefit because of the way software is written and sold.\n\nAutomobile manufacturers sell their cars worldwide, but they are customized for local markets. The car you buy in the United States is different from the same model sold in Mexico , because the local environmental laws are not the same and manufacturers optimize engines based on where the product will be sold. The economics of building and selling automobiles easily allows for this differentiation.\n\nBut software is different. Once California forces minimum security standards on IoT devices, manufacturers will have to rewrite their software to comply. At that point, it won't make sense to have two versions: one for California and another for everywhere else. It's much easier to maintain the single, more secure version and sell it everywhere.\n\nThe European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which implemented the annoying warnings and agreements that pop up on websites, is another example of a law that extends well beyond physical borders. You might have noticed an increase in websites that force you to acknowledge you've read and agreed to the website's privacy policies. This is because it is tricky to differentiate between users who are subject to the protections of the GDPR -- people physically in the European Union, and EU citizens wherever they are -- and those who are not. It's easier to extend the protection to everyone.\n\nJUST WATCHED How British spies made a cyber immune system Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How British spies made a cyber immune system 03:32\n\nOnce this kind of sorting is possible, companies will, in all likelihood, return to their profitable surveillance capitalism practices on those who are still fair game. Surveillance is still the primary business model of the internet, and companies want to spy on us and our activities as much as they can so they can sell us more things and monetize what they know about our behavior.\n\nInsecurity is profitable only if you can get away with it worldwide. Once you can't, you might as well make a virtue out of necessity. So, everyone will benefit from the California regulation, as they would from similar security regulations enacted in any market around the world large enough to matter, just like everyone will benefit from the portion of GDPR compliance that involves data security.\n\nMost importantly, laws like these spur innovations in cybersecurity. Right now, we have a market failure. Because the courts have traditionally not held software manufacturers liable for vulnerabilities , and because consumers don't have the expertise to differentiate between a secure product and an insecure one, manufacturers have prioritized low prices, getting devices out on the market quickly and additional features over security.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut once a government steps in and imposes more stringent security regulations, companies have an incentive to meet those standards as quickly, cheaply and effectively as possible. This means more security innovation, because now there's a market for new ideas and new products. We've seen this pattern again and again in safety and security engineering, and we'll see it with the Internet of Things as well.", "Nota del Editor: Pedro Brieger es un periodista y soci\u00f3logo argentino, autor de m\u00e1s de siete libros y colaborador en publicaciones sobre temas internacionales.

Y no ser\u00eda la primera vez que se usa la venganza como arma pol\u00edtica.", "Washington (CNN) Democrats made massive gains in statehouses in Tuesday's midterm elections, reversing an imbalance that had grown under former President Barack Obama's tenure and given Republicans much more power at the state level.\n\nThough ballots are still being counted in some states and recounts are possible in close races, Democrats appear on track for a net gain of about 300 state legislative seats.\n\nThe party also claimed seven governors' offices that had been in Republican hands, winning races in Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and Wisconsin.\n\nThe victories got little national attention but have major implications for 2020's presidential election and for the next decade in Congress. Most state legislatures draw district lines, an authority Republicans used to cement their House majority for the last eight years.\n\nThe wins mean Democrats now control the governorships of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- the three \"blue wall\" states that delivered Donald Trump the presidency in 2016.\n\n\"Not only does this have huge implications for the people of the Midwest, but it also is a major game-changer looking ahead to 2020's presidential race,\" said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association who oversaw the party's gubernatorial campaign efforts this year.\n\nInslee's DGA had launched an \"Unrig the Map\" project aimed at giving Democrats a voice -- or at least a veto -- in the redistricting process. It targeted seven states, three with sitting Democratic governors (Virginia, Colorado and Pennsylvania) and four with GOP governors (Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Maine), where the GOP has an 18-seat advantage in congressional representation. Democrats won all seven.\n\nDemocrats also cut deeply into Republicans' more than three-to-one lead in \"trifectas\" -- states where one party controls the governor's office and both branches of the legislature.\n\nBefore the election, Republicans had 25 trifectas and Democrats had just eight, according to the National Council of State Legislatures\n\nBut after Tuesday's election, Democrats are projected to add six more: Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico and New York. That brings their total to 14.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, gained a trifecta in Alaska but saw theirs broken up in Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin and New Hampshire.\n\nDemocrats also took control of a total of seven legislative bodies -- New Hampshire's House and Senate, Colorado's Senate, Connecticut's Senate, Maine's Senate, New York's Senate and Minnesota's House.\n\nDemocratic strategists and activists spent two years urging the party's donors and supporters to pay more attention to statehouses. Democrats had watched as Republicans used their state-level influence to weaken labor unions, impose strict voting laws and draw district maps that protected their majorities. The culmination of that years-long project came into view after Democrats realized that, without the White House, they'd lost their grips on levers of power at the federal and state level.\n\nThe party's base paid much more attention to state races over the last two years, said Jessica Post, the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. She said the party raised and spent $35 million in the 2018 election cycle on statehouse races -- more than double its $16 million raised and spent in the 2016 cycle.\n\nPost said the DLCC is setting a budget goal of $50 million in the 2020 election cycle. She identified Pennsylvania's House and Senate as top Democratic targets in 2020, as well as Michigan's House, Minnesota's Senate, Iowa's House and North Carolina's House. Arizona's legislature could be a target, too, but midterm ballots are still being counted there, so the legislature's makeup is not yet fully clear.\n\nA strategic goal in 2020, Post said, is improving the staffing for state legislative campaigns -- including deploying field organizers earlier. Virginia's House, where the GOP holds a one-seat majority, will be an early test in 2019, she said.\n\n\"Having strong campaign staff around these candidates is something we need to strengthen,\" she said.\n\nCatherine Vaughan, the CEO and co-founder of Flippable, a political action committee launched after the 2016 election to help Democrats take control of closely divided state legislative chambers, said her group raised $2.1 million over the 2018 cycle -- but that donors still need to shift their eyes from congressional races to statehouses.\n\n\"I still don't think we're spending money in a smart way. I think that people get that states are important now, but they're not really putting their money where their mouth is,\" she said of Democrats broadly.\n\n\"I think donors need to have a better investment strategy going forward. They need to think about, what are the greatest points of leverage where their dollars can go further?\"", "Van Jones is the host of the \"The Van Jones Show\" and a CNN political commentator.

She is a progressive black woman running for governor against a conservative white man in a deep-red state that Trump won handily in 2016.\n\nBut the truth is: Her campaign was so good, and she is so compelling, that Abrams would almost certainly be governor-elect right now -- if the election had been fair.\n\nAs the final votes are tallied, Kemp enjoys a razor-thin margin -- but it is the product of misconduct so brazen and unethical that UN monitors would likely declare a stolen election if the contest were held in another country.\n\nThat's why, right now, every voter in Georgia should be logging onto the secretary of state website or calling Election Protection at 1-866-OUR-VOTE to ensure their votes were counted. Those who cast a provisional ballot should head to their county election office immediately, bringing a ballot receipt and driver's license/ID or proof of citizenship. The deadline is today, Friday, November 9; the time varies by county. (You can learn more at www.GoVoteGA.org ).\n\nIf this assessment sounds extreme -- take a look at the top eight things Kemp did to steal the election:\n\nOverseeing the election he ran in: Kemp supervised and monitored his own gubernatorial election as Georgia's secretary of state and refused to step down until Kemp supervised and monitored his own gubernatorial election as Georgia's secretary of state and refused to step down until two days after the polls closed. He ignored former US President and Georgia native Jimmy Carter , who urged Kemp to foster voter confidence and avoid any risk of bias by resigning.\n\nPurging voters from the rolls: Under Kemp,\n\nClosing polling places: Georgia shut down : Under Kemp, Georgia eliminated 1.5 million people from voter rolls between 2012 to 2016 -- nearly 10.6 percent of the total -- in part through an \"exact match\" standard that deleted people if so much as a comma was out of place.Georgia shut down 214 polling places across the state, mainly in areas with higher poverty rates and significant populations of people of color.\n\nDisenfranchising voters: Between 2013 and 2015, the state cited its \"exact match\" protocol and canceled nearly 35,000 voter registration applications (76 percent were from applicants who identified as African-American, Latino or Asian-American), according to Between 2013 and 2015, the state cited its \"exact match\" protocol and canceled nearly 35,000 voter registration applications (76 percent were from applicants who identified as African-American, Latino or Asian-American), according to a lawsuit against Kemp filed by a coalition of civil rights groups.\n\nSowing voter confusion: Days after the midterm voter registration deadline in Georgia passed, 53,000 voting applications were still pending, the Associated Press reported. An Days after the midterm voter registration deadline in Georgia passed, 53,000 voting applications were still pending, the Associated Press reported. An AP analysis found that 70% of the applications were from black Georgians.\n\nCreating long lines with too few voting machines: Voters, many in areas with significant minority populations, waited an average of three hours to cast their votes on November 6, a representative from the nonpartisan organization Verified Voting told Voters, many in areas with significant minority populations, waited an average of three hours to cast their votes on November 6, a representative from the nonpartisan organization Verified Voting told Wired . Some voters waited for hours because Kemp's office did not provide power cords for voter machines. Thousands of voters waited at precincts with only three voting machines -- and now, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Kemp's office had hundreds of unused voting machines sitting in a warehouse.\n\nForcing voters to use provisional ballots: The combination of voter roll purges and strict voter ID laws (Brian Kemp himself was initially The combination of voter roll purges and strict voter ID laws (Brian Kemp himself was initially turned away from the polls on Tuesday) forced many eligible voters to use provisional paper ballots. Many of these have not yet been counted\n\nRefusing to secure elections: Georgia is Georgia is one of a handful of states that runs its elections using direct recording electronic machines without keeping a paper trail of votes. Kemp repeatedly ignored warnings and fought legal efforts to force him to secure the vote and create a paper trail, all while accusing Democrats of trying to hack the state's voter registration files.\n\nIt is hard not to conclude that Kemp is either incompetent at running elections -- or thought the only way he could win would be to cheat.\n\nJUST WATCHED 11 House, 2 Senate races yet to be called Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 11 House, 2 Senate races yet to be called 05:40\n\nYet despite it all, Stacey Abrams is quite nearly within the range to force a runoff election on December 4. Under Georgia law, a candidate for governor must secure 50% of the vote.\n\nIf none of the above had occurred, Abrams almost certainly would have won outright or held Kemp under that level. As it is, there may be sufficient votes yet uncounted to force a runoff. Voters in Georgia deserve for there to be a runoff so they know their next governor was fairly and legitimately elected.\n\nKemp has tried to distract us by stepping down as secretary of state immediately after the damage was done. He has even declared victory, even though there remain uncounted votes. Worse, the secretary of state's office is not cooperating with the Abrams campaign to determine how many.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

Rick Scott -- the Republican candidate for US Senate in the state -- requested the state law enforcement agency investigate possible fraudulent activity in Broward and Palm Beach counties as his race against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson appears headed for a recount. Scott currently leads in the race, but his margin has narrowed as counties finish their counts of provisional and vote-by-mail ballots.\n\n\"Tonight, I am asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate this immediately and I am considering every single legal option available,\" Scott said on Thursday. \"No ragtag group of liberal activists or lawyers from DC will be allowed to steal this election from the voters in the state of Florida.\"\n\nGretl Plessinger, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesperson, told CNN that the department reached out to the Florida Department of State to offer their assistance with any investigation involving the collection and tabulation of votes in the 2018 election.\n\nOn Friday morning, the Department of State informed the law enforcement agency that they have received \"no allegation of criminal activity\" thus far as it relates to the election.

About 7% of Advantage members \u2014 1.5 million people \u2014 will have access, Medicare officials estimate.\n\nThat means even for the savviest shoppers, it will be a challenge to figure out which plans offer the new benefits and who qualifies for them.\n\nMedicare officials have touted the expansion as historic, and an innovative way to keep seniors healthy and independent. Despite that enthusiasm, a full listing of the new services is not available on the web-based \"Medicare Plan Finder,\" the government tool used by beneficiaries, counselors and insurance agents to sort through dozens of plan options.\n\nEven if people sign up for those plans, they won't all be eligible for all the benefits. Advantage members will need a recommendation from a health care provider in the plan's network. Then they may need to have a certain chronic health problem, a recent hospitalization or meet other eligibility requirements.\n\nMedicare counselors from California to Maine say key details are not included on the government's website. In some cases, if insurers offer the new benefits, the plan finder will indicate 'yes' or 'no,' said Georgia Gerdes a health care choices specialist at AgeOptions, the Area Agency on Aging in Oak Park, Illinois, outside Chicago. That's hardly enough, she said.\n\n\"There is a lot of information on the plan finder, but there is a lot of information missing that requires beneficiaries to do more research,\" said Deb McFarland, Medicare services program supervisor at the Southern Maine Agency on Aging.\n\nNonetheless, officials say the added benefits will help Advantage members prevent costly hospitalizations. Federal approval of additional benefits is \"one of the most significant changes made to the Medicare program ,\" Seema Verma, the head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told an insurers' meeting last month. She said she expects plans to expand services in coming years.\n\nMedicare Advantage plans, which are an alternative to traditional Medicare, serve 21 million beneficiaries and limit their out-of-pocket expenses. But they also restrict members to a network of doctors, hospitals and other medical providers. They often offer benefits not available in traditional Medicare, such as dental and vision care, hearing aids and gym memberships.\n\nThe federal government pays a set amount to the plans to help cover the cost of each member. The Trump administration gave insurers more money to spend on benefits next year \u2014 an average pay raise of 3.4%, seven times more than the rate of increase in 2018.\n\nEnrollment is underway for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as for people in traditional Medicare who want to buy a Part D policy for drug coverage. The deadline for choosing either type of plan is Dec. 7.\n\nAmong the new benefits that some Medicare Advantage plans said they will offer are:\n\nTrips to the pharmacy or fitness center in addition to doctor's appointments for plan members, depending on where they live or their health conditions.\n\nA monthly or quarterly allowance for over-the-counter pharmacy products such as cold and allergy medications, eye drops, vitamins, supplements and compression stockings.\n\nHouse calls by doctors or other health care providers, under certain conditions.\n\nA home health care aide for a limited number of hours to help with dressing, eating and other daily activities, possibly including household chores and light housekeeping.\n\nHowever, plans offering these and other services will likely have only some of the options and will have different eligibility criteria and other limitations. The same services likely won't be available in every county the plan serves.\n\nFor example, next year an estimated 150,000 Humana Medicare Advantage members in Texas and South Florida \u2014 two of the 43 states Humana serves \u2014 who cannot be left alone at home will be able to get a free in-home personal care aide for up to 42 hours a year, so that their regular caregiver can get a break. And more than half of the members in Cigna-HealthSpring Advantage plans will have access to free transportation services in all but five of the 16 states and the District of Columbia where the company sells coverage.\n\nTo find these supplemental benefits, seniors can use the online plan finder. After they enter their zip code and get a list of plans available locally, they can click on a plan name. That will take them to another page that offers more details about coverage, including a tab for health and drug plan benefits. That page might say whether the new services are offered.\n\nBut often the website will simply indicate that specific benefits are available \u2014 and perhaps not name them \u2014 and advise consumers to contact the plan for more information. A Medicare spokesperson confirmed that there is currently not an indicator on the plan finder for plans offering these expanded health-related supplemental benefits.\n\nIn addition to extra benefits, other variables should be considered when choosing an Advantage plan, such as which health care providers and pharmacies participate in a plan's network, which drugs are covered and the costs.\n\nWhere available, several insurers say the new services will be free with no increase in monthly premiums.\n\n\"We certainly believe that all of the ancillary benefits we provide will help keep our members healthy, which is good for them, and it's good for us in the long run,\" said Steve Warner, head of the Medicare Advantage product team at UnitedHealthcare, which insures about 5 million seniors or 1 in 4 Medicare Advantage members.\n\nInsurers are betting that services will eventually pay for themselves.\n\nDawn Maroney, consumer president at Alignment Healthcare, which serves eight counties in Southern California, said it's much cheaper to give an air conditioner to someone with congestive heart failure to keep that patient healthy than to pay for more expensive medical treatment.\n\nBut if the new benefits are such a good idea, they should be available to the majority of older adults in traditional Medicare, said David Lipschutz, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.", "(CNN) The Southern California city of Thousand Oaks was dealt two traumas in less than 24 hours: A fatal mass shooting at a bar's college night, followed by wildfires that threatened homes and lives in the area.\n\nA particular city facility became a gathering place for people dealing with both.\n\nEarly Thursday, the Thousand Oaks Teen Cente r, a city-funded recreation site for youths in grades 7-12, was the place where officials directed people for information about the shooting at Borderline Bar & Grill that left 12 dead.\n\nAuthorities used the site as a base where they tried to help worried family members and friends reunite with survivors.

Of the two, Hulu's \"The Bisexual\" is the better bet, while HBO's \"Sally4ever\" is too uneven in tone to recommend a committed viewing relationship.\n\nBoth shows hail from the U.K., deal frankly with sex and are the creative offspring of their stars, who in each case produced, directed and wrote or co-wrote the series. That gives them very distinct voices, although while \"The Bisexual\" navigates well between comedy and drama, \"SALLY4EVER\" muddles the relatable conflict of its title character with the cartoonish nature of the people surrounding her, including her coworkers and thoroughly obnoxious boyfriend.\n\nIn \"The Bisexual,\" Desiree Akhavan plays Leila, who opts to take a break from her longtime girlfriend (Maxine Peake), who is pressing her to get married and have children. During the time apart, Leila discovers -- and acts upon -- an attraction to men, despite her assertion early in the show that being bisexual is \"tacky ... like your genitals have no allegiance.\"\n\nLeila, happily, isn't the only character dealing with confounding problems, as she rents a room from Gabe (Brian Gleeson), a novelist whose personal and professional lives are both essentially blocked. Their budding friendship becomes a central pillar of the six-episode show, but the two are surrounded by quirky personalities, including Leila's lesbian friends, who are generally ghast when they learn about her exploration.\n\n'The Bisexual'\n\nAs Leila notes, the sense of betrayal and inner turmoil stems from the struggle for gay acceptance, while the protagonist in \"SALLY4EVER\" faces what plays like a more conventional coming-out story.\n\nRead More", "Bankers are putting a \"full court press\" on the White House to make a deal that would end the escalating trade war between the two nations, Navarro said during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC.\n\n\"If and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald J.

He added that the US was looking to achieve progress on North Korea, discuss strategic security and reduce fentanyl imports to the US.\n\nChinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and Mattis warned against conflict, while comments by top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi and Pompeo underscored divisions between the world's two largest economies, now engaged in a trade war.\n\nPompeo said the US side had been \"forthright in addressing significant differences between our nations\" and laid out the Trump administration's larger goal. \"The US is not pursuing a cold war or containment policy with China,\" Pompeo said. \"Rather, we want to make sure China acts responsibly and fairly.\"\n\nWei warned that \"confrontation or conflict between the two militaries will spell disaster for all\" and said that \"cooperation is the only option for us.\"\n\nMattis added his own caution, saying that \"competition does not mean hostility, nor does it lead to conflict. High-level dialogue like this helps diminish the space between us.\"\n\nBut the exchange on display before reporters served to show just how much space there is between the two sides, particularly over the South China Sea and freedom of navigation.\n\nMattis repeated the position that \"the United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. The US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, one that is underpinned by a rules-based international order and regional stability, is unwavering.\"\n\nHe added that the Pentagon has \"sought ways to lessen tension, maintain open lines of communications between our militaries and reduce the risk of miscalculation.\"\n\nYang pushed back hard. \"The US should stop sending its vessels and aircraft close to\" Chinese territory in the South China Sea, the Chinese minister said.\n\nBeijing has steadily been building artificial islands and military installations to cement its claim to the highly contested territory. China expects the US \"to respect China's security interests in the Asia-Pacific, China's sovereignty and development interests,\" Yang said Friday.\n\nWhile the US and others have pointed to China's construction of facilities in the South China Sea that effectively create military bases, Yang suggested said that if any country is militarizing the region, it is the US.\n\n\"We believe that no country should use any excuse to engage in militarization in the region. Actually, to pursue militarization in the region will not only undermine interests of regional countries but will hurt the countries that take these actions themselves,\" Yang said. \"There's no such problem of the freedom of navigation and overflight being obstructed, so to use the freedom of navigation and overflight to pursue military action is unjustifiable.\"\n\nYang expressed China's unhappiness about Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, saying the pact \"needs to be continued to be implemented and observed.\"\n\nHe also singled out Trump's decision to pursue a trade war with Beijing, saying that \"a trade war, instead of leading to any solution, will only end up hurting both sides and the global economy.\"\n\nPompeo, who has made religious freedom a priority at his State Department, said he had had a \"good conversation\" on the US' concerns about China's treatment of religious minorities amid reports that Beijing is in the midst of a large-scale effort to \"re-educate\" its Uighur Muslim population concentrated in Xinjiang province.\n\nYang deflected the issue, saying that \"matters related to Xinjiang are China's internal affairs.\"\n\n\"Foreign countries have no right to interfere,\" he said.\n\n\"Within the confines of law, the government has taken steps to crack down on ethnic separatist activities and violent terrorist crimes to safeguard national security and life and property of the people,\" Yang said, seeming to refer to the Uighur detention camps in Xinjiang.\n\nPompeo said the US had also expressed concern about China's approach to Taiwan, particularly its efforts to limit international engagement with the breakaway province.\n\nAgain Yang and Wei pushed back, speaking of Taiwan as an \"integral\" and \"inseparable\" part of China. Yang said he hoped the US would \"respect\" and \"not interfere\" with Chinese internal affairs when it comes to Taiwan\n\nChina ultimately hopes to \"achieve reunification\" of Taiwan with China, Wei said. If military actions erupted over Taiwan, the Chinese government would work to achieve reunification \"at any cost,\" just as the United States experienced during the Civil War, he said.", "Reporter: Is Kellyanne's [Conway's] husband's wrong?\n\nTrump: Who?\n\nReporter: Kellyanne's husband wrote that the appointment was unconstitutional.\n\nTrump: You mean Mr. Kellyanne Conway?\n\nReporter: He wrote that you're unconstitutionally appointing him. He is wrong?\n\nTrump: He's just trying to get publicity for himself. Why don't you do this: Why don't you ask Kellyanne that question, all right? She might know him better than me. I really don't know the guy.\n\nFirst, some context. Kellyanne Conway, in case you have spent the last few years on another planet, is a White House counselor to Trump. She is married to a man named George Conway, a well-known Washington lawyer and a finalist for the post of solicitor general in the early days of the Trump administration.\n\nMore importantly, Conway -- George, that is -- has emerged as one of the leading critics of President Trump. Conways preferred method of pushing back on Trump is via Twitter , but on Thursday night, Conway co-authored an op-ed in The New York Times in which he blasted Trump's decision to name Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, calling it \"unconstitutional\" because Whitaker has never been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHere's the key piece of the, uh, piece:\n\n\"We cannot tolerate such an evasion of the Constitution's very explicit, textually precise design. Senate confirmation exists for a simple, and good, reason. Constitutionally, Matthew Whitaker is a nobody. His job as Mr. Sessions's chief of staff did not require Senate confirmation. (Yes, he was confirmed as a federal prosecutor in Iowa, in 2004, but Mr. Trump can't cut and paste that old, lapsed confirmation to today.) For the president to install Mr. Whitaker as our chief law enforcement officer is to betray the entire structure of our charter document.\"\n\nAnd because Donald Trump is Donald Trump, not only did he respond to Conway's provocation but did so by insulting him -- and referring to his critic by referring to him as \"Mr. Kellyanne Conway.\" (Sidebar: Trump's put-downs are almost all tied to his men's-locker-room sensibility; to Trump, it should be embarrassing for Conway to have a wife who is more well-known/successful than him.\")\n\nWhile this is the first time Trump has engaged on the conundrum of one of his top advisers being married to one of his biggest Republican critics, it's far from the first time people have noticed that the whole thing is, well, weird.\n\nWrote The Washington Post's Ben Terris in an amazing profile of the Conway situation\n\n\"The Conways, like the rest of the country, have been jolted by the Trump presidency. They love each other, are exasperated by each other, talk about each other behind each other's backs. They share a roof and live in different bunkers.\n\n\"This may be the story of any marriage \u2014 partners can drive each other crazy and still stay together for 50 years \u2014 but this marriage is, in many ways, emblematic of our national political predicament, particularly on the right.\"\n\nThose bending over backward to give the Conways the benefit of the doubt compare their relationship to that of James Carville and Mary Matalin, the most famous political odd couple. But the comparison breaks down quickly. First off, Carville was a Democrat, Matalin was a Republican. Both of the Conways are Republicans. George introduced his wife to Trump -- and, according to Terris, he wept tears of joy when Trump was elected President. Second, Carville never worked in the Clinton White House. Not only does Kellyanne Conway work in the White House but she is one of the most recognizable figures in Trump's administration.\n\nHer high profile, coupled with George's increased and increasingly critical tweeting about Trump, have made for any number of awkward moments where husband and wife seem to be cheering (or razzing) from both the home and away stands.\n\nThat's particularly acute when it comes to the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, being led by Robert Mueller. George Conway has been an outspoken defender of Mueller -- and has publicly chastised Trump for his criticism of the former FBI director. When Trump suggested that the Mueller appointment was unconstitutional, Conway tweeted this : \"It isn't very surprising to see the president tweet a meritless legal position, because, as a non-lawyer, he wouldn't know the difference between a good one and a bad one.\"\n\nKellyanne Conway, on the other hand, has been singing from the Trump playbook on the Mueller investigation. \"This is just a witch hunt,\" Conway said in a July interview on Fox News Channel. \"It's all a hoax.\"\n\nAs you can see, all of this was pretty damn awkward even before the President of the United States answered a question about the Conways. Of course, Trump has always been the looming presence in political Washington's most fascinating marriage. And that's according to none other than Kellyanne Conway.\n\n\"I feel there's a part of him that thinks I chose Donald Trump over him,\" Kellyanne told Terris of her husband. \"Which is ridiculous. One is my work and one is my marriage.\"", "San Francisco (CNN Business) You've heard of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, but you're probably less familiar with flavors like praline cheddar swirl, apple pistachio mouth or roasted monster dream.\n\nThese are just a few of the many quirky things Janelle Shane, an optics research scientist in Louisville, Colorado, has trained artificial intelligence to come up with in her free time.\n\nAlthough her experiment is just for fun, it's a reminder how humans are still a key part of the AI training process and it highlights the limitations and potential biases that come along with that.\n\nShe collects lists, such as Halloween costume ideas and horror-movie titles, and uses them to teach an algorithm to generate its own examples, such as \"Sexy banana\" and \"The Haunting of Flesh Show.\"\n\nShane, 34, posts the wacky creations on her blog , AI Weirdness, and has a growing following online among the AI community, including Google's AI head Jeff Dean.\n\nCompanies already use artificial intelligence in many ways, from understanding what you're saying to Alexa when you talk to your smart speaker to detecting credit-card fraud.h\n\nIncreasingly, companies are using AI for more creative endeavors, such as a series of Toyota car ads made by working with IBM's Watson AI system. Meanwhile, Burger King also released a series of funny-sounding ads with phrases it claimed were whipped up by AI, including \"The Whopper lives in a bun mansion, just like you,\" as part of a marketing stunt to poke fun of the technology.\n\nJanelle Shane trains artificial intelligence in her free time.\n\nFor Shane's AI creations, she uses a type of machine-learning algorithm known as a neural network, which is modeled after the way neurons work in a brain.\n\nShe gives the neural network a long list of what she wants it to imitate, such as names of snakes. It pores over this training data to figure out, for example, the order of letters and words that might typically show up in a snake name. The algorithm compares its predictions about what a snake name may look like with the data Shane gave it. It uses that information to learn over time and get closer to actual snake name suggestions.\n\nResults can be chuckle-worthy -- take \"Texan farter snake\" -- but also show many of AI's strengths and weaknesses. A neural network can quickly learn about a simple concept, but it is dependent on the data that us humans feed it, for better or worse.\n\nFor the past two years Shane has trained a neural network to come up with Halloween costume suggestions. It picked up on the word \"sexy\" both times because the term was mentioned repeatedly in the lists it was trained on, including \"sexy nurse.\"\n\nThe algorithm's interpretation of good sexy costumes, including \"sexy lamp\" and \"sexy pumpkin pirate,\" might not be what you would expect to see at a costume store.\n\n\"It's not solving the question of, 'What is the best answer?'\" she said. \"It's solving the question of, 'What did the humans in my data set do?'\"\n\nIt also highlights the importance of keeping an eye out for biases in data and AI -- something Shane agrees is tricky because \"bias is everywhere.\" While it's not a big deal if there are biases in the data used to train algorithms for Shane's hobby, it can have serious implications in the real world. AI-assisted decisions about whom to offer a mortgage or a job could be biased against certain types of people, if there are biases in the data used to train an algorithm.\n\nTech companies have faced criticism in recent years for bias issues related to their AI. In 2015, Google apologized after a black software developer tweeted that Google Photos labeled images of him and his friend as gorillas. More recently, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have said that they're working to spot and remove bias in AI by setting standards for how to develop the technology and rolling out tools to measure an algorithm's bias\n\nTo get a sense for how well a neural network could write tech and business headlines, I gave Shane over 8,000 CNN Business headlines published over the past year. She used them to train her algorithm to come up with other suggestions.\n\nThe results reflect the reality of tech and business in 2018 with some weird twists. There were imaginary stock-market moves (\"Premarket stocks surge on report of Philadelphia Starbucks Starbucks Starbucks\"), big-name companies' nonsense business dealings (\"Facebook is buying a big big deal\"), and plenty of how-to pieces (\"How to buy a nightmare\").\n\nArjun Chandrasekaran, a graduate student at Georgia Tech who studies AI and humor, said Shane's work \u2014 which he likens to an AI form of MadLibs \u2014 highlights an important point about current AI capabilities: the humor comes from the mistakes the neural network makes while working on a real task (such as generating names of real snakes), rather than from coming up with results that are meant to be funny. Researchers are studying that kind of computational humor, he points out, but figuring out what makes a thing funny is really hard.\n\nShane's handpicked curations also show that, even as AI is rapidly improving and fears are rising that such technology will supplant jobs, it still has a lot to learn.\n\n\"These kinds of algorithms that today we're calling artificial intelligence are so simple and limited and hyper-focused on one task,\" she said. \"They're nothing like these science fiction AIs that react to the world more like humans and can hold complex thoughts and react to new situations and things. We're miles and miles away from that.\"\n\nThis was particularly evident when Shane attempted to get a neural network to come up with its own jokes.\n\n\"How many engineers does it take to change a light bulb?\" it asked.\n\nThe AI-generated answer? \"A star, an alligator and because they are bees.\"\n\nIt's very clear this neural network still has a lot of work to do before it can take its act on the road.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

He did not have any assistance during the incident, the investigation found.\n\n\"If the pilot had wanted to avoid impact with the ground, he had time and energy to pull the column back, raise the nose, and initiate a climb,\" the report said\n\n\"Extensive investigative activity failed to reveal any additional subject(s) involved in the planning or execution of the unauthorized flight,\" it said.\n\nRussell, a 28-year-old baggage handler for Horizon Air, stole an empty passenger plane that was parked in a maintenance area and was not scheduled for flight.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressed confidence in a new interview that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election will be handled \"appropriately.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Wall Street Journal , Sessions said that although he finds the duration of the investigation -- it was launched in spring 2017 -- unexpected and \"unhealthy,\" the former Alabama senator said \"the country is committed to this course.\"\n\nSessions' successor at the Justice Department, Matthew Whitaker, has faced criticism for his previous comments arguing that Mueller's investigation goes too far. Despite his past comments, however, Whitaker appears unlikely to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation.\n\nSessions told the Journal that if given a second chance, he would still recuse himself from the probe despite the decision angering President Donald Trump. \"No one is above supervision,\" he told the Journal.\n\nSessions was fired as attorney general with a call from Trump's chief of staff John Kelly on Wednesday afternoon. Sessions' last day was busy but routine -- until Kelly's unexpected call just prior to Trump's 11:30 a.m., post-election news conference, he told the Journal. He declined to comment on his discussions with White House officials about his ouster.\n\nRead More", "CNN sent Sayoc's appointed attorney, Sarah Jane Baumgartel, requests for comment by phone and email but has not received a response.\n\nThe charges include the use of a weapon of mass destruction, interstate transportation and receipt of explosives, threatening interstate communications and the illegal mailing of explosives.

Investigators believe he made the pipe bombs in the van, law enforcement sources told CNN.\n\nCourt records show Sayoc had been arrested at least nine times, mostly in Florida, for accusations of grand theft, battery, fraud, drug possession and probation violations.\n\nAfter being arrested in South Florida, Sayoc was transferred to New York, where some of the targets of the packages live and work.\n\nWhile the exact content of the packages has not been disclosed in detail, prosecutors said the bombs had clear similarities.\n\nThey were found in envelopes that had return labels listing the address and name of US Rep.

The policy was first reported by Bloomberg\n\nPassengers are free to wipe down their seating areas of potential allergens at any time, but the new policy gives extra consideration to concerned allergy sufferers.\n\n\"I certainly understand the deep, deep concern people have, especially parents with young children,\" Mohr said. Mohr herself suffers from a severe nut allergy and carries an EpiPen.\n\nThe airline encourages passengers to take all necessary medical precautions before flying, she said.\n\nAmerican Airlines hasn't served peanuts in years, but it does serve a combination of warm mixed nuts to First and Business class passengers on trans-oceanic flights, Mohr said. That mixture does not contain peanuts.\n\nBut the airline cannot guarantee that customers won't be exposed to peanuts or tree nuts on any flight as passengers may bring their own snacks aboard or transfer nut residue from other places.\n\nThe new policy was included in a filing with the U.S. Transportation Department on November 6. It comes in response to a complaint filed last year by Food Allergy Research & Education and the mother of a child with a dangerous peanut allergy, Bloomberg reported.\n\nSouthwest airlines said that they will stop offering peanuts on all flights as of August 1 \"to ensure the best on-board experience for everyone, especially for customers with peanut-related allergies,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nMohr dismissed any notion that passengers who do not suffer from allergies might take advantage of the policy.\n\n\"We do not expect rampant abuse of this policy. We do not believe our customers will fake a potentially life-threatening allergy just to board the plane a little bit faster,\" she said.\n\nSouthwest Airlines stopped serving peanuts on all flights this summer.", "One morning last year, millions of Americans got into their cars to go to work and discovered they now had the ability to order breakfast and coffee while they drove. Overnight, General Motors had downloaded a new application called Marketplace that operated in their cars' center touchscreens.\n\nWith it, they could order breakfast from Dunkin' Donuts, takeout from Applebee's or find a parking garage near their destination . They could interact, in limited ways, with a number of other businesses \u2014 and the choices have grown since then.\n\nThe transactions are carefully constrained so drivers aren't distracted. Some things, such as making hotel reservations, can only be done when the car is parked.\n\nGM gets some money from each Marketplace transaction. But for now, it's far from a cash cow.\n\n\"I promise you, we are not getting rich off Marketplace,\" said Christine Sitek, who heads GM's various \"connected car\" initiatives.\n\nInstead, the focus is on helping customers enjoy their time in the car more and doing so safely, she said. But GM is also learning from apps like this about what customers like to do in their cars. And all of that information that's being gathered means that Marketplace could become a serious revenue source in the future, Sitek said.\n\nAnd those people might be hungry. Maybe they'll want a Dunkin' biscuit sandwich and some coffee. Also, since they're not driving, they might want to watch a movie or TV show. GM is already building relationships with merchants today and learning a lot about what people want to do and buy when they're in cars.\n\nBy the time this future arrives, GM should be well ahead of the curve.\n\nThe path to making real money from these interactions is not to focus too much on the financial part, said Sitek. That will come organically from trying to make the products work better and from learning from customers.\n\n\"If I just set my sights on making money, then I'll lose sight of the customer experience,\" she said.\n\nIt's important for automakers like GM to try these sorts of services because, if they don't, outside companies will simply provide them instead using mobile phone technology, said Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst with Autotrader.com.\n\nGM's big advantage over other automakers is its decades' long involvement in car connectivity. Its famous OnStar service was introduced in 1996, a time when cell phones were still in their big, heavy infancy. GM engineers, in a joint venture with tech companies, repurposed 90s cell phone technology to send data back and forth from cars to computers and call centers manned by people who could talk to you over that same connection. That was big stuff back then.\n\nThe original OnStar was operated by a handset that looked very much like a 90s cell phone, but with a cable. Those call center operators could, when called automatically after an airbag deployment, call the appropriate emergency responders to reach you wherever you happened to be \u2014 even if you couldn't tell them where you were.\n\nA man presses the blue OnStar button in a GM car.\n\nNothing like that had ever been done. Just that last part \u2014 calling the right first responders for your exact location \u2014 required GM building, on its own, an enormous location-tagged database of police, fire and EMS services all across America.\n\nHaving OnStar in place has allowed GM, over the years, to experiment with various ways people, cars, and a huge network could interact. The services provided have changed over the years. Today, it's marketed mostly for its safety benefits, such as the automatic crash alert, which remains its biggest selling point.\n\nOnStar is free for a period of time with virtually any GM car or SUV. After that, subscriptions range in price from $25 to $60 a month.\n\nGM Marketplace, on the other hand, doesn't require a subscription and it's free to anyone with a GM car. But, just as OnStar did early on \u2014 and is still doing \u2014 it's allowing GM to gather more information about what people, cars and networks do when you put them together. That's where the future is.", "(CNN) Some animals were evacuated from the Los Angeles Zoo on Friday as a fast-growing brush fire on a nearby hillside threatened the facility.\n\nThe zoo staff evacuated birds used in its \"World of Birds\" show and some of the smaller primate species, the zoo said in a statement posted on its webpage.\n\n\"We turned on our sprinkler systems, and our Ground Maintenance staff began hosing the hillside by hand,\" the statement said. \"It does not appear that the smoke is causing any issues for the animals but on-site staff is monitoring the conditions.\"\n\nSmoke from a wildfire rises over the Los Angeles Zoo on Friday.\n\nThe zoo was closed to the public on Friday. Earlier in the day, the zoo said it was awaiting guidance from the Los Angeles Fire Department on whether to open.\n\nThe fire department said the fire in Griffith Park was holding at 30 acres in heavy brush on steep and difficult-to-navigate terrain.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629

That's the message from progressive groups and some local policymakers in New York City and Washington.\n\nIn a 14-month frenzy, cities across North America bent over backward to court Amazon's second headquarters, or HQ2, by offering subsidies and tax breaks. Recent reports suggest Amazon might split its the new office campuses between Long Island City in Queens and Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nThe company has pledged to spend at least $5 billion and create 50,000 jobs as part of the project. Even divided over two locations, that represents an enormous infusion into a local economy.\n\nBut as Amazon's decision ( AMZN ) nears, opposition to cities' huge packages of economic incentives is getting louder. Groups organizing to pressure local leaders say financial sweeteners are unnecessary due to Amazon's size and wealth, and they think the money would be better spent on services for the community.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to fight Amazon coming to New York, and [to stop] any benefits that our mayor and our governor might lavish on them,\" said Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, an advocacy group that supports low-income communities in the region.\n\nAmazon has long been a target of liberal advocates. They have protested its record on pay and work conditions at its warehouses and blame the company for the gentrification of its home city, Seattle. Senator Bernie Sanders has slammed the company's treatment of workers , though he ultimately supported Amazon when it said it would instate a $15-an-hour minimum wage for US employees last month.\n\nNow the with the possible arrival of new Amazon headquarters in Long Island City and Arlington, the activist fight is spreading \u2014 and some local officials are on the activists' side.\n\n\"My understanding is the public subsidies that are being discussed are massive in scale,\" New York state senator Michael Gianaris, who represents the Long Island City area, told CNN Business. \"Why we would need to give scarce public dollars to one of the richest companies on Earth is beyond me.\"\n\nThe terms of the proposals to Amazon from New York City and the Washington area haven't been disclosed, so it's uncertain what exactly is on the table. However, precedent and public statements indicate that Amazon could get generous deals in exchange for investment and jobs.\n\nOn Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that he would change his name to \"Amazon Cuomo\" if it meant the company would pick New York for HQ2. \"I am doing everything I can,\" he told reporters, adding that New York has \"a great incentive package.\" Cuomo is working directly with Amazon to try to bring Amazon to Long Island City, a senior New York government official with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN.\n\nCuomo's enthusiasm might not trickle down. Local elected officials have taken to speaking out against a potential deal.\n\n\"The lack of transparency in this process is outrageous,\" local councilman Jimmy Van Bramer said in a statement Thursday.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has called securing HQ2 a \"tremendous opportunity,\" but conceded this week that \"there are real development pressures to be navigated.\" He said the city would not award Amazon any special incentives beyond what's available to all companies and developers.\n\n\"I want to differentiate the state and the city \u2014 the city is not providing subsidies,\" he told reporters Tuesday . \"We do not believe in subsidies to corporations for retention or to attract corporations.\"\n\nFor state senator Gianaris, incentives aren't the only issue. He also wants to know what Amazon intends to do to ease stress on the area's schools and strained subway system. \"This is a neighborhood that's already being overdeveloped,\" he said.\n\nActivists say they have similar concerns about Amazon as they do about Walmart ( WMT ). Progressive groups have successfully kept Walmart out of New York City for decades, citing their treatment of low-wage workers and harm to smaller businesses.\n\n\"We believe Amazon is just the next iteration of what Walmart was,\" said Westin of New York Communities for Change.\n\nSuch points of view have also bubbled up in the Washington area. A group called \"Obviously Not DC,\" supported by activist group Fair Budget Coalition and the D.C. chapter of the Democratic Socialists, has a simple tagline: \"Fund our communities, affordable housing, schools, and transit. Not Amazon.\"\n\nMassive incentive packages are a popular tool to lure large development projects, said Megan Randall, research analyst at the Tax Policy Center. The problem is, such packages often lack the proper accountability measures to make sure promised economic benefits materialize, she said. It's also not clear that businesses prioritize incentive packages when making decisions about where to locate, she added.\n\n\"Tax incentives, the research shows, actually play a fairly secondary role in terms of where firms decide to go,\" Randall said.\n\nIssues with hefty economic incentives came up when Foxconn, the Taiwanese Apple supplier, announced in 2017 it would invest $10 billion to build a plant in Wisconsin. It pledged to create as many as 13,000 jobs by 2020, and was awarded more than $4 billion in incentives in return.\n\nThis week, the Wall Street Journal reported Foxconn is having trouble finding the engineers it will need at the plant, and that it is trying to get staff at some of its plants in China to move. Foxconn denied the report\n\nEven so, economic incentives are a common part of development deals. For cities, it's difficult not to throw in perks like tax breaks and subsidies if competing regions are offering them.\n\n\"It's hard to tell if the questions that the public and policymakers are asking are going to become a feature of the discussion,\" Randall said. \"or if tax incentives are going to retain their popularity.\"", "Red Hook, New York (CNN) \u2014 As historians mark exactly a century since the end of World War I, a group of pilots take to the air in a museum's vintage airplanes, bringing a bygone era back to life.\n\nLocated just two hours north of New York City, the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome in New York's Hudson Valley boasts around 60 vintage biplanes -- including reproductions of the famed SPAD VII and the classic Sopwith Camel.\n\nTake a turn off picturesque Stone Church Road, cross a foot bridge and you're jumping back 100 years to a time when airplanes were made of wood and fabric held together by a bit of wire -- and not much more.\n\nWatching these planes fly is all the more fascinating when you realize that World War I started just about a decade after the first flights by the Wright brothers, making it the first major conflict involving the large-scale use of aircraft.\n\nIn those days, many considered duty as a combat pilot a virtual death sentence. More than 15,000 pilots died during the war.\n\nThat's not too hard to believe when you watch these fragile airplanes in action. Pilots flew essentially totally exposed in open-air cockpits affected by wind, rain, and of course, enemy fire.\n\nPilots had to master dangerous, difficult-to-control machines and were pitted against one another in close combat. Often the air war became crude and personal, as enemy pilots flew so close to each other they could see each other's facial expressions -- or hand gestures.\n\n360\u00b0 Experience: Fly in the WWI fighter planes\n\nThe experience of flying vintage biplanes 'in the moment'\n\nCNN's drone production team, CNN Air, recently documented some of the museum's World War I-era fighter planes re-enacting dogfights at Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome. A team of FAA-certified drone pilots flew their unmanned aerial vehicles in concert with aerodrome pilots, capturing breathtaking video of their aerobatic skills.\n\nFor the pilots who come to Old Rhinebeck to fly these planes, this is not a job. It's more like a pilgrimage to be a part of something unique.\n\n\"It's very visceral. It's literally in your face,\" said museum Vice President and Chief Pilot Clay Hammond. \"You're wearing a helmet and goggles and the wind's blowing against your cheeks. You're hearing and seeing and smelling everything that goes on with that airplane. It's much more in the moment. It's much more of a tactile experience.\"\n\nThe longtime fighter pilot tradition of keeping score began in World War I. This was the war when pilots started counting their kills.\n\nThose who downed five or more enemy aircraft won the right to be called \"aces.\"\n\n\"When we're up there in these 100-year-old airplanes, you can absolutely think about what it would have been like to have been in that situation on the Western Front in 1917 and how those guys must've felt in terms of kill or be killed,\" Hammond said.\n\nIs there anything inherently more dangerous about flying these old airplanes -- versus a new plane that's designed to perform complex aerobatic maneuvers?\n\n\"Only a little bit,\" Hammond said. The aerodynamic performance capabilities of these planes obviously aren't as sophisticated as today's aircraft.\n\n\"As pilots we're always taught to respect the limits of whatever machine we happen to be in,\" Hammond said. \"So there's always risk mitigation going on any time we fly anything. It's just that we probably think about it a little more carefully when flying a 100-year-old World War I fighter.\"\n\nRelated content 12 of the best military museums around the world\n\nArmistice Day to Veterans Day\n\nIt was 100 years ago on November 11, 1918, when leaders agreed to an \"armistice\" peace deal to end a four-year war that had claimed millions of military and civilian lives.\n\nIn the United States, they turned it into a national holiday called Armistice Day. By the 1950s, that day became more widely known as Veterans Day.\n\nMany of Old Rhinebeck's exhibits are original World War I-era planes, including a Nieuport 10 dating back to 1915, a 1917 Morane-Saulnier A-1 and the famed Curtiss JN-4H -- widely known as The Jenny. In 1918 over Fort Tilden, New York, a Jenny became the first plane ever launched from a blimp. Jennys also were used to start the US Air Mail system.\n\nHammond described the museum's 1918 Jenny as one of its crown jewels.\n\nOld Rhinebeck's 1918 Curtiss JN-4H \"Jenny.\" David Trost/CNN\n\n\"It's the plane a pilot of the time would have been first exposed to ... before moving up to the next step which would generally be actual exposure to the actual fighters that they would be flying on the front line,\" he said.\n\nThe museum's Jenny is powered by an original, water-cooled Hispano-Suiza V8 engine that can muster 150 to 180 horsepower. The plane is exceedingly slow, with a takeoff speed around 35 to 40 miles per hour and a maximum speed of about 75 mph.\n\nRelated content Who really killed the Red Baron? Account offers new wrinkle\n\nThe museum also flies two Fokker Dr.1 triplane reproductions -- three-winged planes made famous by the fearsome German fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen -- aka the Red Baron.\n\nVon Richthofen was ace of aces, credited with 80 victories -- the most of any WWI pilot. He died after being gunned down in flight in April 1918 in France.\n\nOld Rhinebeck Aerodrome was founded in 1958 by Cole Palen, an aviation enthusiast who loved tinkering with old planes and getting them running again. After he passed away, the aerodrome was established as a nonprofit museum dedicated to preserving and flying many of these historic aviation touchstones.", "\"Heavenly Father, please help us.

If every single person also voted for [the minimum wage increase], that still leaves 387,000 voters,\" said Carl Walz, campaign manager of Raise Up Missouri, the local organizer for the measure. \"That's potentially 31% of the people who voted for Josh Hawley.\"\n\nFeet on the ground\n\nMore than 700 Missouri businesses supported the measure and 25 Arkansas businesses and community organizations supported the wage increases.\n\n\"Every part of mobilizing the campaign was through the coalition-- faith organizations, nonprofits, and businesses,\" said Kristin Foster, campaign director of Arkansans for a Fair Wage, the local organizer for the measure.\n\n\"Arkansas is a conservative state, but we're also a compassionate state,\" she added. \"Poverty is very far-reaching here -- if you live in Arkansas, you know someone who's struggling.\"\n\nThe initiative faced a legal challenge from Randy Zook, president of the state's Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Arkansas, who unsuccessfully sued to keep it off the ballot through Arkansans for a Strong Economy, an advocacy group he chairs.\n\n\"Out-of-state interests poured more than a million dollars into the campaign,\" Zook said in a statement. \"We continue to believe this will ultimately hurt Arkansas workers, resulting in fewer jobs, reduced work hours and increased prices for consumers.\"\n\nOpponents in Missouri echoed concerns that the pay bump would lead to fewer jobs and hours for workers. Recent research from Seattle, which passed a minimum wage initiative four years ago, indicates that workers are taking home more money, even though hours are falling\n\n\"Kiosks, self-checkout machines, and similar automation becomes more attractive as labor costs rise, so look for an increase of machines replacing some lower wage workers,\" Ray McCarty, president of the business employer group Associated Industries of Missouri, told CNN in an email. \"The better approach would be for workers to obtain training needed to fill the thousands of jobs that require some skill and pay much more than minimum wage.\"\n\nBut Lew Prince, founder and former co-owner of St. Louis record store Vintage Vinyl, argued that a wage increase for low wage workers would actually help state businesses by going right back into the local economy.\n\n\"Workers are customers,\" said Prince, who campaigned for the Missouri ballot measure with the advocacy group Missouri Business for a Fair Minimum Wage. \"Increasing the minimum wage is a great way to boost small business and the economy, because low wage workers turn right around and spend their much needed wages -- they spend them on Main Street.\"\n\nThe wage debate\n\nThe last time Congress raised the federal minimum wage was 2009, when it went to $7.25 an hour. Ten large cities and seven states have passed minimum wages to between $12 and $15 through August, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, New York, Washington state and Washington DC.\n\nLarry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said Thursday that he did not anticipate the Trump administration cutting a deal with a Democratic majority on an increased federal minimum wage, which he called \"a terrible idea.\"\n\n\"It will damage particularly small businesses. To force them to take kind of a payroll increase would be silly ... Idaho is different than New York, Alabama is different than Nebraska,\" Kudlow said, adding that he would \"argue against state and local [minimum wages], but that's up to the states and localities.\"\n\nThe strong economy and tight labor market have finally started generating signs of wage growth, with the most recent jobs report showing a 3.1% jump from the prior year.\n\nBut David Cooper, a senior analyst at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, says that those trends have mostly passed over lower wage workers.\n\n\"For most of the last 50 years, as the US economy has grown and productivity has risen, hourly pay has barely budged,\" he said. \"Since 1973, average labor productivity has grown 77 percent, yet hourly compensation for the typical US worker ... has grown only 12.4 percent. For low wage workers, the trends are even worse.\"\n\nWages on the ballot in 2020?\n\nSchleifer said that after having \"proven the model\" in three elections, The Fairness Project will take the lessons learned from 2018 and bring them to 2020. While he declined to confirm any formal state partnerships among possible 2020 fronts, Florida, Nevada and North Dakota are \"already on that list,\" he said.\n\n\"The lesson of 2018 for us is that we can run initiatives in dark red states,\" Schleifer said. \"People were skeptical of Missouri and Arkansas for the minimum wage. What we proved this cycle is that even during one of the most partisan political cycles, voters want to do what's right.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa bolsa de M\u00e9xico se desplom\u00f3 tras un plan de Morena para prohibir las comisiones bancarias\n\n(Expansi\u00f3n) - La Bolsa Mexicana de Valores extiende este viernes su racha de ca\u00edda al retroceder m\u00e1s de 2%, luego de desplomarse en la v\u00edspera m\u00e1s de 5% en su peor retroceso en siete a\u00f1os, tras la iniciativa de Morena en el Senado que busca prohibir m\u00e1s de una decena de comisiones bancarias.\n\nCerca del mediod\u00eda, el \u00cdndice de Precios y Cotizaciones (S&P/BMV IPC) pierde 2,63% a 43.032 unidades.

And again, it's because of the remarkable closeness of two high-profile races in the state : The governor's race between Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis and the Senate race between incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and challenger Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Both races seem likely headed to either a manual recount (the Senate race) or an automatic machine recount (the governor's race).\n\nThe races have captured the attention of one Donald Trump, who tweeted this Friday as he headed to Paris aboard Air Force One: \"As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don't worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\" (Elias, a Democratic election lawyer, was involved in the 2008 recount in the Minnesota Senate race in which Al Franken came from behind to win .)\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nAll of the talk of Florida and recounts is enough to give some political observers a severe case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, given the extended recount of the state's 2000 presidential vote which led to George W. Bush's ultimate victory. I reached out to an expert on that recount -- the New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin who literally wrote the book on the 2000 recount -- for some perspective about what's changed and what hasn't in Florida's election system over the past 18 years. (Toobin is also CNN's chief legal analyst).\n\nOur conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n\nCillizza: The words \"Florida recount\" have political types breaking out in hives. What are the similarities -- and differences -- between the 2000 Florida recount and what we are headed for in the gubernatorial and Senate races in the state this year?\n\nToobin: The biggest difference is that the notorious punch-card ballots -- where voters push out the little chads to make their choices -- are no longer in use. Much of the confusion in 2000 came from the difficulties in determining how punch-card ballots were cast -- that is, if an indented or hanging chad counted as a vote. That problem is gone, because most of the state (including Broward County) now uses optical scan ballots -- that is, ballots where the voter fills in a bubble, like on a standardized test, to vote. In theory, determining the intent of the voter on these kinds of ballots is a lot easier to determine when there is a recount.\n\nAnother difference is that at this point in the process it's really more accurate to refer to what's going on as a count, rather than a recount, especially in Broward County, which is the current focus of controversy. There is still no final vote total from Broward, which is a heavily Democratic county that includes the city of Fort Lauderdale. It's only after an initial count is complete that it's possible to make a realistic assessment of whether the two Democratic candidates have any chance of making up the difference.\n\nTo put it another way, Nelson is currently behind by about 16,000 votes and Gillum by about double that. There is no way, really, to make those kinds of deficits up in a recount. But if the difference continues to shrink as Broward completes its initial count, then the Democrats may have a chance in the recount. Remember that Al Gore lost Florida by 535 votes -- which is a great deal smaller margin than the ones we are discussing in 2018.\n\nCillizza: It's been almost two decades since hanging chads and butterfly ballots. Has Florida improved its voting system? Why or why not? . Has Florida improved its voting system? Why or why not?\n\nToobin: Yes, as noted above, the systems are improved. Optical scan, as the current system is called, is much better than the punch card. But these systems are still under the control of people who are often not very good at their jobs. And election technology is never a priority for hard-pressed counties. There is no constituency that pressures government to spend money on elections. So no one generally notices or cares until a situation like this one arises.\n\nCillizza: In 2000, it's broadly acknowledged that the Bush PR operation outflanked that of Gore -- and it made a difference. True? And if so, how important is getting out and framing the recount in a favorable light?\n\nToobin: Definitely true. As I discuss in : Definitely true. As I discuss in my book , the Republicans, led by James A. Baker III, understood that the controversy was as much political as legal. The Republicans used spokespeople and protesters (\"Get out of Cheney's house!\" they chanted at Gore.) The Democrats tried to take the higher road, and that was a mistake.\n\nBut the biggest issue was that the Republicans were always ahead in the count in Florida, and that's what matters most. It's always easier to protect a lead than attack one. And most recounts end with the candidate who was ahead finishing with a bigger lead -- rather than a switch.\n\nCillizza: President Trump suggested there might be a role for the federal government in the Florida recount. What could that possibly look like?\n\nToobin: Hard to know exactly. The Republicans have made vague and unsupported : Hard to know exactly. The Republicans have made vague and unsupported allegations of fraud , which could be investigated by the FBI. But there has been nothing to investigate so far. Unlike in many countries, states and localities run elections in the United States, not the central government. That's where the decisions will be made.\n\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"The biggest lessons both parties going into the 2018 recounts should learn from the 2000 experience is ____________.\" Now, explain.\n\nToobin: \"... elections should be run by well-funded professional administrators, not partisan hacks using outdated equipment.\"\n\nIt's simply absurd that we elect the people who run our elections -- usually the secretary of state.

They hate racism. They talk all day about \"The Man\" oppressing their people.\n\nThey're just too hip to vote because they think America is too irredeemably racist for voting to make a difference.\n\nThey are gripped by what one writer calls \"the highest level of woke-osity.\"\n\nAfter Tuesday's midterms -- when one black candidate for governor narrowly lost in Florida and another trailed in a Georgia race still too close to call -- I wondered what those \"too woke to vote\" were telling their voting friends and families now.\n\nIt's not a trivial question. How those conversations go could affect what happens in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIf Democrats hope to take back the White House in two years, they will have to do better than mobilize people who don't normally vote in the midterms. Florida -- and maybe Georgia -- shows that won't be enough.\n\nThey will have to mobilize people who don't normally vote at all.\n\nAnd that means waking up the \"too woke to vote\" crowd.\n\nThere was a lot of hope riding on the candidacies of Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams. Gillum lost his bid to become the first black governor of Florida, a crucial swing state. And Abrams is trying to become the country's first black female governor. Though she has yet to concede, her opponent, Republican Brian Kemp, has declared victory.\n\nBoth Gillum and Abrams attracted the support of former President Barack Obama and black celebrities. Both had to contend with opponents who employed tactics that seemed, at least to some, straight out of the Jim Crow playbook, including racist rhetoric and the use of a term that once seemed relegated to the history books: complaints of \" outside agitators .\" There were also allegations of voter suppression.\n\nBut Abrams' and Gillum's supporters hoped they could overcome those obstacles by turning out voters who don't normally vote in midterm elections.\n\nIt wasn't enough in Florida, and it may not have been enough in Georgia -- in part because Republicans did the same, and perhaps even better.\n\nPresident Trump matched the enthusiasm of progressive voters in those states by mobilizing his white, rural base with promises to protect them from, as Peter Beinhart wrote in The Atlantic , \"Latino murderers and women who destroy men's lives by alleging sexual assault.\n\n\"The harsh truth is this: Racism often works,\" Beinhart said. \"Cross-racial coalitions for economic justice are the exception in American history. Mobilizing white people to protect their racial dominance is the norm. The lesson of 2018 is that American politics is not reverting to 'normal.' In many ways, Trumpism is normal.''\n\nWhether Democrats can get those \"too woke to vote\" to the polls will be crucial to the party's success.\n\nThis issue isn't abstract to me.\n\nOne of my best friends in Atlanta is \"too woke to vote.\" He studies black history, loves the Black Panthers, talks constantly about racism. But he won't vote.\n\nJust two weeks ago, we had an impassioned argument about the importance of voting. I told him I didn't care who he voted for; just vote.\n\nThe discussion got so heated that he stepped away from me as I raised my voice. We changed the subject to safer ground: sports and women.\n\nIt made me think about what writer and poet Michael Harriot said in a 2017 essay in The Root\n\n\"You can't have an intelligent conversation with someone with a Ph.D. in wokeology because, when losing an argument, they can always counter actual facts with: 'Who told you that? The white man?'\"\n\nStill, after Tuesday, I wanted to know what my \"too woke to vote\" friend thought.\n\nWhat would he make of an election where the President of the United States aired an ad that was so racist that some networks, including Fox News, refused to air it? What would he think about the cartoonishly racist robo-calls directed against black candidates? What would he think about the Republican who successfully ran against Gillum in Florida and warned voters not to \"monkey this up\" by electing his black opponent?\n\nMost important: Did he have any second thoughts about not casting a ballot for Abrams, despite the narrow outcome of her race?\n\nHe cut right to the chase and flashed his Ph.D. in wokeology: He told me he figured Abrams' opponent would win because, as Georgia's secretary of state until Thursday, he oversaw the election.\n\n\"I don't regret not voting and I don't plan on voting going forward,\" he told me. \"I have absolutely no trust or faith in the US political and justice system.\"\n\nSomeone I know on Facebook put it more succinctly:\n\n\"F--- the vote.\"\n\nIf Democrats hope to win in 2020, they must somehow do what Obama did in 2008: cut through a lifetime of cynicism among those who think the system is rigged and that change is impossible -- and get them to the polls.\n\nAnd they must somehow do it after two charismatic black candidates in the South failed to win two big elections after both seemed like they had so much going for them.", "Rachel Vogelstein is the Douglas Dillon senior fellow and director of the Women and Foreign Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations and a professor at Georgetown Law School.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) This week, US voters reshaped the face of Congress, pushing women's representation there close to 25% percent for the first time in history. These victories follow an extraordinary rise in female candidates this year, in which 22 women won their party's nomination for the Senate and more than 475 women announced a run for the House.\n\nMore than twice as many women were elected this year than in the so-called \" Year of the Woman \" in 1992, which doubled the number of women in Congress on the heels of the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, then accused of sexual misconduct. A quarter century later, following the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- another Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misbehavior -- history has repeated itself at the ballot box, and then some.\n\nThe surge in women's activism triggered by the election of President Donald Trump is certainly a critical factor in this dramatic increase in women's political participation, but the US midterm election results are also an important part of a striking global trend.\n\nAround the world, women are vying for political office like never before, speaking out against harassment and discrimination, and winning seats at the table. A growing body of evidence suggests that this rise in women leaders can affect the political agenda here in Washington, and in capitals around the world, because increasing women's political representation is not simply a matter of fairness -- it is also a strategic imperative.\n\nTake Lebanon, for example, where a record 113 women registered as candidates in the parliamentary elections this spring -- more than an eightfold increase over the 12 women who registered to run in 2009. In Mexico, an unprecedented nearly 3,000 women ran in the June elections earlier this year, which resulted in the election of the first female mayor of Mexico City -- and full gender parity in parliament.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a 2016 amendment to a local quota law led 17,000 women to compete for seats in the February 2018 elections, in which 2,000 female candidates prevailed -- a staggering 2,340% increase over the 82 women elected in 2011. Just last month, the government of Ethiopia approved the country's first female president and produced the first gender-balanced cabinet in its history.\n\nJUST WATCHED What is period poverty and why does it impact rich countries?

Women are also more likely to reach across the aisle to find common ground: a 2015 study of the US Senate found that female senators more frequently worked across party lines as compared to their male counterparts. In recent years, for example, female senators in the US joined together across the aisle to negotiate an accord to end a government shutdown\n\nTo be sure, electing women will not always produce these results. Not all female leaders will be peaceful, cooperative, or advocate for policies that support gender equality; women, after all, aren't a monolithic group. History teaches that female leaders from Golda Meir to Margaret Thatcher took their countries to war and did little -- if anything -- to address women's needs or advance equal opportunity. Being the first woman elected to a leadership position also has its challenges; navigating historically male-dominated institutions can foster political caution rather than policy change.\n\nBut the evidence we have to date suggests that, in the aggregate, women's leadership promotes stability, equality, and bipartisanship -- values that too often are in short supply in today's political climate. And when women make up a critical mass -- around 25 to 30% -- of legislatures, they are more likely to challenge established conventions and shift policy agendas.\n\nRegardless of political outcome, this new class of women leaders is likely to grow. As women contest and win elections worldwide, they are challenging traditional norms of what a leader looks like -- and inspiring even more women to run for office themselves. Indeed, many of the women who ran in the US election and in recent contests around the world cite the courage of the women who ran before them -- win or lose -- as motivation for throwing their own hats into the ring.\n\nFor more opinion...

described the action as \"unfortunate,\" and said it was taken as a \"last resort.\"\n\nRyanair was ordered to pay back close to \u20ac10 million in French state aid in 2014.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led to the inevitable inconvenience of the 149 passengers on board the immobilized plane,\" the authorities said in a statement.\n\nRead More", "(CNN)--

Pero tambi\u00e9n era peligroso, deliberadamente destinado a agitar a los locos y chiflados\", escribe, seg\u00fan diario The Washington Post, que obtuvo una copia temprana del libro que ser\u00e1 lanzado el pr\u00f3ximo martes.\n\n\"\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasar\u00eda si alguien con una mente inestable cargara un arma y se dirigiera a Washington? \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasar\u00eda si esa persona fuera a buscar a nuestras ni\u00f1as?\", agrega. \"Donald Trump, con sus insinuaciones ruidosas e imprudentes, estaba poniendo en riesgo la seguridad de mi familia.

But I didn't know Matt Whitaker. He worked for Attorney General Sessions.\"\n\nThe President's comments are at odds with the relationship Trump has forged with Whitaker in recent months, even as his opinion of Sessions continued to sour. Whitaker has been at the White House dozens of times, including in meetings with Trump, and the two have spoken by phone on several occasions, including on the day that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was expected to be fired.\n\nAnd in an October 11 interview on Fox News, Trump made clear he did, in fact, know Whitaker well.\n\n\"I can tell you Matt Whitaker's a great guy. I know Matt Whitaker,\" he said.\n\nWhitaker was not hired as Sessions' chief of staff by virtue of any pre-existing relationship with Sessions, but instead because White House officials believed Whitaker's loyalties would lie at the White House and not with the beleaguered attorney general, sources said.\n\nAnd over the last year, Whitaker has told friends about his growing relationship with Trump. The President knew that he had played football and the tall, brawny former US attorney fit the image Trump liked, according to people familiar with their conversations, far more than the diminutive Sessions, whom Trump mocked.\n\n\"He looks like the kind of guy who sits at the head of a table,\" a source familiar with the matter said of Whitaker.\n\nQuestions arise\n\nEven as he claimed on Friday not to know Whitaker, it was clear Trump maintained an affinity for him, praising his qualifications for the job as he insisted Whitaker was being unfairly maligned.\n\nSome legal scholars -- including George Conway , the husband of Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway -- said they thought Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because he is not a Senate-confirmed official. Other critics have slammed Trump's decision to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein because the move puts Whitaker in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which Whitaker had been publicly critical of.\n\nTrump insisted Friday that he had not spoken with Whitaker about the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"I didn't speak to Matt Whitaker about it. I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President's move to distance himself from Whitaker is a familiar refrain Trump has used when associates of his have become embroiled in controversy.\n\nWhen federal prosecutors targeted his longtime former attorney Michael Cohen, Trump insisted Cohen handled only a \"tiny, tiny fraction\" of his legal work. Before that, he claimed that his indicted former campaign chairman Paul Manafort worked for him for \"a very short period of time.\" And shortly before ousting his chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, who also helmed his campaign, Trump maintained Bannon \"came on very late.\"\n\nStill, the President praised Whitaker as \"very highly thought of\" and said that Whitaker is only taking heat because \"anybody that works for me, they do a number on him.\"\n\n\"Matt Whitaker is a very smart man, he is a very respected man in the law enforcement community, top of the line,\" Trump said. \"He's acting, I think he'll do a very good job and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nIn an email to Department of Justice staff on Friday, Whitaker vowed to lead \"a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\"\n\nSense of concern\n\nJUST WATCHED Whitaker linked to defunct 'scam' company Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Whitaker linked to defunct 'scam' company 03:05\n\nTrump's comments came as a growing sense of concern developed inside the White House over the negative reaction to Whitaker being tapped as the acting chief law enforcement official. Several senior officials said they were surprised by the criticism and believe it could potentially jeopardize his chances to remain in the post if it continues to dominate headlines.\n\nIt was not widely known among the staff that he had commented repeatedly on the special counsel's investigation in interviews and on television -- an irony given that Whitaker's TV appearances helped him land his job at the Justice Department and people close to Trump encouraged Whitaker to keep up his TV appearances to draw Trump's attention.\n\nWhitaker was tapped by the White House to serve as Sessions' chief of staff in September 2017, with sources describing then-White House counsel Don McGahn as the person behind the hiring.\n\nMcGahn was drawn to Whitaker because he had a stalwart reputation in right-wing legal circles and because the White House wanted someone who was competent, could mind Sessions and could \"keep things on the rails\" at the Justice Department.\n\nLeonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, said he recommended Whitaker for that post.\n\n\"I recommended him and was very supportive of him for chief of staff for very specific reasons,\" Leo told CNN. \"Jeff Sessions needed a reliable conservative, a strong manager, and someone who had credibility who had previously served the department. Whitaker was a very good former US attorney and is a very good manager. He's a no-nonsense, get-it-done kind of guy.\"\n\nWhitaker and White House chief of staff John Kelly developed a close relationship too. Kelly would often call Whitaker to convey when Trump was unhappy with something at the Justice Department or with Sessions in particular, and another source said Kelly and Whitaker were \"cut from the same cloth.\"\n\nWhitaker also worked to forge a relationship with the President's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner during trips to the White House, understanding they were key to moving up in Trump's eyes.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general who is a Sessions ally and familiar with his senior staff, described Whitaker as a \"good lawyer\" with \"good political skills and instincts\" and said he had grown close to the White House.\n\nTerwilliger said Whitaker's position had put him in contact with the White House \"where he's held in pretty high regard.\"", "Yes, Democrats recaptured the House -- but they didn't achieve the blue tsunami of 40+ seats that some strategists had predicted in the days leading up to vote Tuesday. And Republicans had beaten three Democratic senators -- in North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana -- and had leads in Nevada, Florida, Montana and Arizona. Republicans had also won the governor's mansions in Florida and Ohio, two massive victories in states with big roles to play in the 2020 presidential race and the 2021 nationwide redistricting process.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\"To be honest -- I'll be honest, I thought it was a -- I thought it was a very close to complete victory,\" President Donald Trump told reporters in a post-election press conference on Wednesday.\n\nAnd if the election had ended at midnight on Tuesday night, it would have been a very good election for Republicans. But it didn't. Lots and lots of votes still needed to be counted. And as they have been counted -- and more and more races have been called -- it's become increasingly clear that the original conventional wisdom badly misses the mark. This was, in fact, a very good election for Democrats.\n\nConsider this:\n\n1. Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who trailed Matt Rosendale deep into Wednesday morning, eventually defeated his Republican challenger to claim a third term in a state that Trump won by 20 points in 2016. And Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, ousted Republican Sen. Dean Heller thanks to a massive influx of votes from Clark County (which contains Las Vegas).\n\n2. In Arizona, Democratic Rep. Krysten Sinema took a slim 9,500-vote lead over Republican Rep. Martha McSally in the open seat Senate race after trailing for much of the previous 48 hours. (This one isn't over -- there are still roughly 350,000 votes still to count.)\n\n3. Florida, which looked like a major success story for Republicans on Tuesday night, now looks much more muddled . In the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, there is almost certain to be a manual recount , with the two candidates separated by about 15,000 votes. In the governor's race, which Democrat Andrew Gillum previously conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis, the margin has continued to shrink since election night, with the two men now separated by just 36,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast. DeSantis' current .4% margin of victory means that race is set to be subject to an automatic machine recount.\n\n4. House Democrats have now picked up 30 total seats . And of the 10 House races not yet called by CNN, the Democratic candidate leads in five. If those numbers hold, Democrats will get to a 35-seat pickup and might even gain a few more based on where the outstanding votes are coming from (Democratic areas? Republican ones?) in the remaining uncalled races. Tweeted Cook Political Report's House editor David Wasserman on Friday : \"Final result: closer to 40 than 30. Largest Dem gain since Watergate.\"\n\n6. At the state legislative level, where Democrats were crushed by Republicans in the 2010 and 2014 midterms, the party seized control of seven state legislatures, according to tabulations made by the National Conference of State Legislatures . (The chambers Democrats took over: New Hampshire's state Senate, Connecticut's state Senate, Minnesota's state House, New Hampshire's state House, Maine's state Senate and the New York state Senate.) According to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee , 372 state legislative seats switched from Republican to Democratic on Tuesday night -- although some counting of votes still remains.\n\nNone of this is to say that Republicans didn't win anything. They did! Ohio is a major win at the governor's level. And beating three Senate Democratic incumbents is a big deal.\n\nBut let's have some real talk here.\n\nFirst, the Senate map for 2018 was one of the worst maps in modern memory for Democrats. They had 26 seats up, including 10 in states Trump won. Of those 10, five were states Trump won by double digits; three of those five (Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota) were places where Republicans won on Tuesday.) And in the only state Hillary Clinton won where a Republican incumbent was running -- Nevada -- Democrats won.\n\nSecond, it's crazy not to think of a Democratic gain of -- at least -- 35 seats in the House as anything short of a wave. (In 2014, when Republicans picked up 30 seats, it was rightly described as a national wave against then President Barack Obama.) Especially when you consider that Republicans dominated the 2011 redistricting process nationally, creating districts all over the country that tilted their way -- a high hurdle Democrats needed to overcome to win the majority.\n\nWhy aren't Democrats celebrating more given their gains? I think some of it has to do with the delayed nature of some of the races; lots of the better results for Democrats didn't come until Wednesday (or later) while Republicans got a lot of their good news before people went to bed on Tuesday night.\n\nBut another part of it is, I think, Democrats' fault. They lost -- or at least fell behind -- in the three races that every national Democrat was most focused on: Gillum in Florida, Stacey Abrams in the Georgia governor's race and Rep. Beto O'Rourke's Senate race in Texas. Losing those races took a trio of potential HUGE national stars off the table for Democrats. That said, they made plenty of other gains and have plenty of other people to fill the \"rising stars of 2018\" category including Michigan Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn short: When all the votes are finally counted in the 2018 election, this will look like a very good result nationally for Democrats. Was it an A+ for their side? No. But it was a hell of a lot better than a C.", "New York (CNN Business) Here's a scary thought: General Electric's cratering stock may not reflect the true depths of disaster at the storied company.\n\nGE's stock will plunge another 33% to $6 by the end of 2019 due to mounting debt problems , JPMorgan Chase analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr. warned in a brutal research report published on Friday.\n\nThe ominous call from Tusa, the biggest GE ( GE ) bear on Wall Street, promptly sent the stock dropping as much as 10%. GE bounced off the lows after the company said it has a \"sound liquidity position.\"\n\nTusa presciently went negative on the stock in May 2016, when the stock was trading at $30. It has since lost nearly three-quarters of its value.\n\nGE is down 52% this year alone, making it the third-worst stock in the S&P 500. GE was kicked out of the Dow over the summer , ending a 110-year streak.\n\nEven though a $6 share price was \"hard to image\" just months ago, it may not even be the worst case scenario, Tusa wrote. \"It can get worse.\"\n\nCiting GE's bleak third-quarter results, Tusa slashed his 2019 and 2020 earnings targets to well below Wall Street's consensus view. He pointed to continued trouble at GE Power, the division that makes turbines for power plants. GE has been caught flat-footed by the shift away from coal and natural gas in favor of renewable energy.\n\nInvestors are growing more worried about GE's debt-riddled balance sheet, created by years of poorly-timed acquisitions and bad decisions.\n\nThe problem is GE's profit and cash flow are shrinking much faster than its debt. GE and GE Capital listed total borrowings of $115 billion at the end of the third quarter, compared with $126 billion at the end of 2017.\n\nGE shares initially rallied after Larry Culp was named the new CEO but they have since resumed their long slump.\n\nGE's credit rating has also been downgraded to the point that it's been forced to retreat from the $1.1 trillion commercial debt market in favor of more expensive bank financing.\n\nTusa warned that the leverage situation at GE Capital, the company's bleeding banking arm, is approaching a \"tipping point.\" He estimated that GE Capital has up to $45 billion of \"stranded\" debt and liabilities. That includes the company's long-term insurance portfolio and legal troubles at WMC , the defunct subprime mortgage lender.\n\nThe \"clock is ticking\" on GE Capital, Tusa wrote.\n\nIn response to the JPMorgan report, GE said in a statement that it is a \"fundamentally strong company with a sound liquidity position.\"\n\nGE has $40 billion of credit lines with banks that it can use to fund the business. GE recently said it has tapped a \"portion\" of these revolvers. GE has also promised to rapidly shrink GE Capital, continuing a years-long process that began after the financial crisis.\n\n\"We are taking aggressive action to strengthen our balance sheet through accelerated deleveraging and position our businesses for success,\" the company said.", "(CNN) \u2014 A flight attendant went the extra mile for a mother who had run out of formula to feed her baby on a domestic flight in the Philippines.\n\nPhilippine Airlines' flight attendant Patrisha Organo heard an infant crying soon after takeoff and \"approached the mother and asked if everything's okay,\" she wrote in a Facebook post, which included a picture of her holding the infant.\n\n\"Teary-eyed, she [the mother] told me that she ran out of formula milk,\" Organo wrote of Tuesday's flight.\n\nOrgano, who has a young daughter at home, said she felt a \"pinch in my heart\" as there was no formula on the plane.\n\n\"I thought to myself, there's only one thing I could offer and that's my own milk.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nWhen Patricia Beet's employer filed for bankruptcy shortly after the 2008 financial crisis, her job was relocated from Chicago to Los Angeles. Separated by three time zones, Patricia and her husband, David, started cooking together virtually through Skype as a creative way to connect.\n\nMoney was tight, so instead of buying presents, the couple began gifting their culinary creations, from infused sugars and salts to BBQ seasoning. Before long, they set up shop on Etsy. More than 24,000 sales later, their passion project has become a full-time income stream and allowed them to reunite in the Midwest.\n\nPatricia and David's story, while unique, is illustrative of the new opportunities within the gig economy that emerged in the United States in the 2000s and grew exponentially after the Great Recession. In May of 2017, 21.4 million people worked in \"contingent\" jobs or \"alternative\" jobs, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics . Other measurements show that more than a quarter of workers participate in the gig economy. And although the government has only recently begun attempting to track statistics for the gig economy, its economic footprint is evident. According to our newly released economic impact study , conducted by ECONorthwest, an economic consulting firm, Etsy sellers generated more than $4.7 billion in 2017 and created 1.24 million jobs in the US economy.\n\nBut not all gig economy workers see the same success that Patricia and David did, and not all gig economy jobs are created equal. In fact, gig economy workers are more than three times as likely as full-time employees to be uninsured. Additionally, self-employed workers bear the full weight of payroll taxes, and online sellers face additional costs due to state internet sales taxes.\n\nIf our newly elected representatives truly believe in positioning the gig economy for long-term success, they will take action and make America's countless gig economy workers and microentrepreneurs a top priority.

One of the rumored HQ2 spots is Long Island City in Queens, fittingly just a 22 minute ferry ride from where some of Amazon's biggest fans work: Wall Street.\n\nAlthough Amazon's stock has been hit by tech turbulence lately, some analysts think it will soon return to and blow past the $1 trillion level it briefly topped in September before the stock pulled back following a disappointing holiday sales outlook.\n\nShares of Amazon ( AMZN ) are currently trading at around $1,720, giving the company a market value of about $840 billion.

That's nearly 40% above where it's trading now -- and it would make Amazon worth about $1.2 trillion.\n\nD.A. Davidson's Tom Forte is even more bullish. He has a target price of $2,450 for Amazon. Forte also thinks investors overreacted to the latest results. He seemed to suggest that investor expectations are way too high for Amazon.\n\nThe company's not perfect.

Esta tendencia continu\u00f3 en 2017, con una disminuci\u00f3n del 7%, aunque esto enmascar\u00f3 un aumento en los actos violentos contra los jud\u00edos.\n\nLa naturaleza de los actos antisemitas ha cambiado dr\u00e1sticamente en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, manifest\u00e1ndose en s\u00ed mismo en violencia que ha matado a 11 personas desde 2006.\n\nEn 2015, un hombre armado mat\u00f3 a cuatro personas en un supermercado kosher en Par\u00eds mientras el mundo horrorizado lo ve\u00eda en televisi\u00f3n.

Bill Nelson's re-election campaign has filed a lawsuit against Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner over vote-by-mail ballots and the process used to validate them.\n\nDemocratic lawyer Marc Elias, the lead recount lawyer for Nelson, decried the signature matching process that is used to validate provisional ballots, arguing that it leaves the decision to the \"untrained opinions\" of poll workers to determine \"whether signatures match.\" He said there was a \"complete lack of uniformity\" in how those signatures were judged.\n\n\"This serves as an outright disenfranchisement and burden on the right to vote,\" Elias told reporters on a call Friday.\n\nThe lawsuit comes amid a bitter fight between Republicans and Democrats in the state over multiple electoral contests, including Nelson's race for re-election and the gubernatorial contest between Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis. The Republican candidates' leads in both contests are narrowing as votes continue to be counted.\n\nDemocrats believe there are enough votes out to tip the Senate race towards Nelson, but are less confident in Gillum's race, where the divide is around 37,000 votes in DeSantis' favor.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy tweeted Friday that he was among the voters whose ballots weren't counted because of an \"invalid signature.\"\n\n\"Hey @MarcACaputo, just saw notice from @PBCounty that my absentee ballot wasn't counted due to 'invalid signature' match,\" he said. \"Should be +1 @NelsonForSenate @AndrewGillum. Must overhaul these ridiculous barriers to voting.\"\n\nFlorida law mandates that any races within .5% would go to a machine recount. For those races that are within .25% after that machine recount, a hand recount would be initiated of ballots marked as undervotes (voters who did not fill out all available choices on the ballot) or overvotes (voters who made more choices than allotted on the ballot). The hand recount would only occur if there are enough overvotes, undervotes and provisional ballots left to change the outcome.\n\nAt the center of the battle is Detzner, a Republican who was appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Nelson's GOP opponent in the contested Senate race.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by Nelson's campaign and the Democratic Executive Committee of Florida, asks for all votes cast using vote-by-mail or those \"determined to involve a signature mismatch, be counted as valid votes.\"\n\n\"This entirely standardless, inconsistent, and unreliable signature matching process, which has a disparate impact on People of Color and young, first time voters, violates the prohibition against undue burdens on the right to vote, enshrined under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and subjects Florida voters to disparate treatment and inconsistent standards in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause,\" reads the lawsuit.\n\nElias opened a call with reporters on Friday by highlighting how the split between Scott and Nelson has shrunk since Election Day and confidently said he believed, after all votes are counted correctly, Nelson would prevail the winner.\n\n\"I would expect when we go into a machine recount and then a hand recount, right now the results are unknown who has won, and if I had to place a bet, I would say it is more likely than not Sen. Nelson will prevail in a recount,\" he said.\n\nElias dismissed suggestions that there are not enough votes out there to close the margin for Nelson.\n\n\"Fifteen thousand is a lot of votes when you are talking about an election of 1 million votes or 2 million votes. We are talking about 8.5 million votes. We are less than two-tenths of 1 percent. ... And when viewed in that arena, it is actually quite close.\"\n\nScott's campaign wasted no time in responding to Elias, charging in a statement that Nelson and his lawyers are conducting \"fraud\" in fighting the current results.\n\n\"Until today, the Nelson campaign has been working on voter fraud behind the scenes in secret,\" read the statement. \"With today's filing, their desperation has driven them to ask the federal courts to allow voter fraud. They are asking courts to overrule election officials and accept ballots that were not legally cast.\"\n\nThey added: \"Bill Nelson's entire campaign has been a fraud. Nelson relied on fraud when he attacked Gov. Rick Scott's record, Nelson relied on fraud when he misrepresented his Senate record, and now he is hoping that voter fraud will help him hang on to power.\"\n\nIn total, the statement used the word \"fraud\" six times.\n\nThe statement comes hours after Scott stepped outside the governor's mansion in Florida on Thursday night to announced that he and the National Republican Senatorial Committee were filing two lawsuits, one against Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda C. Snipes and another against Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher.\n\nOn Friday, Scott and the NRSC won both lawsuits, meaning the election supervisors must comply with Scott's requests for certain vote-related information.\n\n\"The people of Florida deserve fairness and transparency, and the supervisors are failing to give it to us,\" Scott said on Thursday. \"Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward counties.\"\n\nThe governor also went after Elias, listing all of the other recount elections he has been involved in and faulting him for telling reporters he was \"here to win the election.\"\n\n\"He is here to try to steal the election, and to try to thwart the will of the voters of Florida,\" Scott said.\n\nElias responded on Friday, calling his list a \"promotional video\" for the lawyer.\n\n\"I thank him for that,\" the Democratic lawyer said dryly.\n\nScott also asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the election \"immediately\" in his statement on Thursday.\n\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement spokesperson Gretl Plessinger told CNN on Friday that they reached out to the Florida Department of State to offer their assistance with any investigation involving the collection and tabulation of votes in the election and were told the department has received \"no allegation of criminal activity\" thus far.\n\nBecause of that, the state law enforcement agency is not currently investigating anything related to the election, including officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\nNelson, in a taped statement released on Friday, accused Scott of \"trying to stop all the votes from being counted\" and \"impeding the democratic process.\"\n\n\"This process is about one thing: Making sure that every legal ballot is counted and protecting the right of every Floridian to participate in our democracy,\" he said. \"Scott is abusing the full force of his public office as governor to stop a complete and accurate counting of all the votes in Florida -- which would determine whether he wins or loses.\"\n\nThe fact that there will be multiple high-profile recounts in Florida gives many political watchers deja vu, given the impact that the state's recount played on the 2000 presidential election that saw President George W. Bush elected after winning Florida by 537 votes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also weighed in on the recount, attacking Elias as Democrats' \"best Election stealing lawyer.\"\n\n\"As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes,\" he said on Twitter . \"Don't worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\"\n\nA White House official and representatives from the Republican National Committee and NRSC did not respond to requests for comment about which lawyers Trump has dispatched to Florida.", "(CNN) The three main wildfires raging in California have expanded rapidly, devouring virtually everything in their paths.\n\nOne fire burned an area equivalent to the size of a football field every second from Thursday into Friday.\n\nIntense winds and low humidity are feeding the flames.

The placement of the Senate race on the ballot could have made it easy to overlook.\n\nOverall, as of Friday, nearly 26,000 voters in the county had cast ballots for governor but skipped voting in the Senate race, according to a CNN analysis of precinct-level results.\n\nBroward County became infamous for vote-counting problems during the 2000 presidential recount.\n\nBroward is a Democratic-leaning county. Among those who did vote in the Senate race there, 69.1% backed incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, while 30.9% backed Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum topped Republican former Rep.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "(CNN) As the wildfire raged nearby, Whitney Vaughan and her husband had just enough time to grab a laundry basket of dirty clothes and some pictures before fleeing their home in Paradise, California.\n\nVaughan could hear screams and explosions nearby Thursday as she and her husband got in their car and drove away. But they soon found themselves trapped with other evacuees in standstill traffic.\n\n\"The flames were whipping and spreading so fast,\" Vaughan told CNN. \"It began to jump the road. There wasn't anywhere to go.\"\n\nFlames consume the Paradise Skilled Nursing facility Thursday in Paradise, California.\n\nPeople began to panic, Vaughan said. In the chaos, one driver backed up and slammed the front of Vaughan's SUV.\n\nMotorists began abandoning their cars, fleeing on foot with their children in tow.\n\n\"There were no firefighters in sight,\" Vaughan wrote on Facebook. \"I am hoping all of these people made it out.\"\n\nSimilar scenes played out in other communities this week as a trio of wildfires raged across the Golden State\n\nThe most devastating is believed to be the Camp Fire, which by Friday morning had grown to 90,000 acres and was encroaching on the city of Chico, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as a Cal Fire.\n\nThe fire has left nine people dead, the Butte County Sheriff's Office said Friday. Four people were found dead in vehicles that were overcome by flames and and one body was discovered near the vehicles. The other victims were found near or inside homes that burned.\n\nThose killed in the vehicles weren't far from where Vaughan and her husband found themselves trapped.\n\nThe blaze broke out early Thursday and has grown at an astonishing rate of 80 football fields per minute . It charred 20,000 acres Thursday in less than 14 hours and has burned an area larger than Manhattan, according to CNN meteorologists.\n\nFueled by high winds and low humidity, the fire has placed millions of people under red flag warnings. Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said 80 to 90% of homes in residential neighborhoods are gone following the Camp Fire. Jones said she drove into Paradise on Friday with a fire official and two council members to assess the damage.\n\nThese abandoned and burned out cars shows you what a panic it must have been for residents trying to escape the Camp Fire.

Or should you rent a getaway with no fixed costs, maintenance or hassle?\n\n\"Vacation homes tend to be the kiss of death for most people's financial plan,\" says Patrick King, certified financial planner at Transformative Financial.\n\nDuring the buying process the assumptions around expenses, rental revenue, taxes, insurance and property management tend to be wildly optimistic, King says. \"One kitchen remodel or a new roof could blow a hole in your return on investment calculations.\"\n\nBut even if a vacation home does turn out to be a terrible investment, it might provide years of family enjoyment, and many consider it a labor of love.\n\nHere's how financial planners, homeowners and investors have approached the decision to buy or rent a vacation home.\n\nAsset or liability?\n\nThe economics of owning a second home rarely work because there are so many unexpected costs, says Eric Gabor, a certified financial planner and founder of Eagle Grove Advisors.\n\n\"People think they are buying an asset, but often, with all the cash outflows, it's more of a liability.\"\n\nIf a buyer is paying all-cash, that's one thing, but likely the second home will add debt to a family's balance sheet and more expenses including property taxes, maintenance and insurance.\n\nGarret Kaiser's lakeside vacation home in Washington that he bought as an investment.\n\n\"With all these expenses, you would likely be better off staying at a hotel or using a service like Airbnb or VRBO,\" says Gabor. \"I'd rather you earmark $15,000 and do a seasonal rental and mitigate your risk.\"\n\nGiven the risk and expense of real estate, he says, an investor would do better putting the money in the stock market.\n\nBut in some circumstances, buying vacation properties can make sense, says Jirayr R. Kembikian, a certified financial planner with Citrine Capital.\n\n\"If an individual can buy a property and still have a diversified portfolio, and can also cover the mortgage, insurance, and taxes with rental income, it could make sense,\" Kembikian says. However, this is only possible if they have substantial assets or the vacation property is very inexpensive.\n\n\"Usually it is a purely emotional decision for these individuals and it makes zero financial sense,\" he says.\n\nA sweet home, but a terrible investment\n\nWendy Marsden plants flowers around her vacation property on an island off the New England coast every spring just so she'll have a beautiful bouquet to leave for rental guests, along with a bottle of wine, when they check in. The house has become a refuge during the off-season, is in a place she's been coming to for years and to which she's considering retiring.\n\n\"However, it is a terrible investment,\" she says.\n\nOur life would have less stress ...and we'd have a great deal more money if we didn't own this vacation home.\" Wendy Marsden, vacation home owner and financial adviser\n\nSince Marsden is also a certified public accountant, certified financial planner and registered investment adviser at ProsperiTea Planning in Massachusetts, she knows all too well that the costs do not add up.\n\nShe says she has earned as much as $14,000 a year renting out the place. But the taxes alone on the property are $8,000. Another $4,000 goes to utilities and fees for listing her property for rent. When she adds in mortgage interest payments, insurance and the costs of repair and maintenance, the total annual cost to own and operate the house is around $24,000.\n\n\"All in all, our life would have less stress, we'd have more time at the place we love, and we'd have a great deal more money if we didn't own this vacation home,\" says Marsden.\n\nSo when her clients start talking about buying a vacation home, she tells them about freezing pipes and no-show renters.\n\nShe counsels clients to rent vacation homes and invest in commercial property instead.\n\nBut she understands the intangibles of owning. \"If you still want your own vacation home, just be clear that it's not an investment, it's consumption item,\" says Marsden. \"Don't fool yourself that it's a good move.\"\n\nDouble down on the investment\n\nIn order to earn positive cash flow from his rental property on a resort lake in Washington, Garrett Kaiser, who works as a real estate broker in Seattle, researched the return on investment of houses in the area. He discovered that larger houses had better rental rates than smaller homes.\n\n\"We got a five bedroom place and could charge higher rents because we are hosting large family groups, wedding parties who are happy to split the cost,\" Kaiser says.\n\nThe great room of Kaiser's vacation home. He rents the home for as much as $1,000 a night during high season.\n\nHis year-round property is booked solid during the 10 weeks of summer at $1,000 a night. In the shoulder seasons and winter there will be fewer bookings and it will rent for $200 to $300 a night. If it is free for a weekend, his family will use it.\n\nAfter owning other investment properties and sweating out managing them himself, Kaiser thought hiring a property manager was an expense he was willing to take on in order to alleviate some of the headaches of owning a property three hours away.\n\nNot only does his property management company, Vacasa , set up the comings and goings of guests, its marketing reach earns him rents that are about 25% higher than similar rentals in his area, he says.\n\n\"If I'm able to charge an additional $20,000 a year because of the property management service, even if they are charging me $25,000, that is $5,000 I'm happy to spend to not have to think about any of it.\"", "President Trump reacts to the heated exchange between CNN's Jim Acosta and himself at a news conference at the White House one day after the midterm elections.", "Washington (CNN) New York Sen.

On the most basic level, it works as an action vehicle, even if the bare-bones plot lacks the ingenuity to sustain its promising start down the stretch.\n\nForgoing high-profile stars, the movie's promotion has focused on J.J. Abrams, even if he's only a producer here, leaving the directing chores to Australian filmmaker Julius Avery. Then again, Abrams produced \"Cloverfield,\" which also confounded expectations by weaving a horror-monster movie together with what felt like an episode of \"Felicity.\"\n\nThe mix-and-match genres idea certainly has its appeal, especially for those steeped in movie conventions. And \"Overlord\" takes off with considerable energy, as a small group of U.S. soldiers (notably color-blind in the casting) survive a harrowing parachute drop into Nazi-occupied France, where their task is to take out a heavily guarded German communications tower, making air cover possible for the D-Day landing.\n\nSaid tower resides in an old church, and the horrors that lurk within go beyond even the customary crimes of the Nazis.

Smith) into the sci-fi and alternate history realms, although no one will confuse this consciously popcorn-y exercise with \"Inglourious Basterds\" or \"The Man in the High Castle.\"\n\nWhile there's a lot going on, the basic character beats are easily identifiable, employing a kind of shorthand with both the heroes and villains.

Few, if any, aspiring musicians or artists can afford the steep rent and the upscale restaurants that define the area now.\n\nHaving lived in the rough-and-tumble downtown neighborhood when rents were cheap and heroin was on every corner, Lurie says he \"liked the Lower East Side when it was dangerous.\"\n\nThis was in the late '70s and early '80s, a couple of years before the infamous Tompkins Square Park Riot , where outrage over a NYC Parks Department's recently instated 1 a.m. curfew led to a clash between protesters and police.

The opinion in this article belong to the author.\n\nAs President Trump's combative pose, picking on CNN's Jim Acosta was splashed across the mainstream newspapers the world over and the President's strident tones on a multitude of issues still reverberated, the silence from Trump's European allies about Wednesday's confrontational press conference has been deafening.\n\nMany of Trump's allies will meet with him in Paris this weekend to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War -- known as the war to end all wars.\n\nTrump will arrive at this commemoration of peace having just opened new hostilities back home, where he threatened his adversaries -- should they not conform to his desires -- that he will take them down.\n\nNot just taking aim at the media he insists on calling fake news, but warning Democrats -- who just won a majority in the House of Representatives -- that if they try to use their new powers to investigate him, he will investigate them too.\n\nIt was this opening salvo in Trumpian zero-sum politics, of the world's most powerful man girding for a roiling two years more in office, that was captured on the front page of the Times here in London.\n\nThe front page shows Trump jabbing his forefinger at Jim Acosta, CNN's senior White House correspondent and -- full disclosure -- my friend and colleague, as Acosta asks a question and a White House aid reaches to take the microphone from him.\n\nSoon after the press conference, the White House pulled Acosta's White House accreditation. CNN has been robust in its defence of Acosta and more broadly the First Amendment and the role of journalists in a democracy.\n\nThe White House response was to falsely claim that Acosta was at fault.\n\nThe message received in Europe is clear: post-midterms Trump is on the offensive, picking up his old grudges and shifting to a new, more aggressive posture.\n\nWhether this new hostility will be confronted by European or other leaders gathering in Paris, who have watched Trump's downward drift from the democratic principles they hold sacrosanct, is unclear.\n\nEven if they wanted an encounter, privately or otherwise with Trump, it will be made harder because he plans to snub a three-day Peace Forum hosted by French President Emanuel Macron for the approximately 70 other leaders following the armistice commemoration.\n\nYet even if the silence in Paris is deafening, it doesn't mean he isn't being judged.\n\nIn recent weeks British officials have criticized Trump for his aggressive stance against journalists.\n\nJUST WATCHED Jim Acosta: We're going to keep doing our jobs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jim Acosta: We're going to keep doing our jobs 03:34\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May's spokeswoman appeared to upbraid Trump in response to comments the US President made at a rally mocking a journalist working for the Guardian who got body-slammed by a member of congress.\n\nThe spokeswoman said: \"He [Trump] obviously made comments at a political rally, and those are for him. But more generally we would always say that any violence or intimidation against a journalist is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nAs recently as late September, May has been championing press freedom in the UK. At a Cabinet meeting considering changes to laws impacting those freedoms, she said: \"it was important for the Government to resist amendments which could undermine our free press.\"\n\nYet in her dealings with Trump, notably when they met in the UK this summer following Trump's putdown of her in national tabloid the Sun, her British reserve may have left Trump assuming she holds journalists in the same contempt he does.\n\nAt a joint press conference in July, Trump said: \"And she's a total professional, because when I saw her this morning I said 'I won't apologize, because I said such good things about you.' She said, 'Don't worry, it's only the press.' I thought that was very professional.\"\n\nFor May and the other leaders attending this weekend's commemoration, Trump's DC dramas won't be a topic of frontline conversation, although on the margins his allies will whisper about him, the midterms and what it all means.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, Germany Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted that it is a \"misconception to now bet on a course correction from Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Foreign Minister, however, did hint at a course correction from Germany: \"the case remains the US is still our most important partner outside Europe.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States. Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily, my Presidential Weekly Briefing focuses on the topics and issues President Trump needs to know to make informed decisions.\n\nHere's this week's briefing:\n\nAs you begin your trip to France, we are providing you with some scene-setting analysis.\n\nThe Armistice celebrations will dominate much of your time, but you will have ample opportunity to interact with both foreign officials and the media in various formats. Scripted public statements are expected to focus on mourning the millions killed and injured during World War I, along with the benefits of making peace, but each world leader attending the event also has his or her own personal list of policy issues to concurrently address.\n\nMore than 100 foreign dignitaries are expected at the Armistice Day ceremonies, including several heads of state with whom you have urgent business. There's President Vladimir Putin (you are due to implement more sanctions against Russia next week), for one, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey from whom you can get more insights into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nPlacing Bets: Which Trump are they going to get?\n\nMost leaders will be questioning which President Trump will show up in Europe, and for how long. They're probably wondering whether you will mark this solemn occasion by focusing on the sacrifices of all those who fought in WWI and the need for peaceful dialogue, or whether you'll use the opportunity to lean right and prioritize nationalist agenda items in line with your previous comments that immigrants are changing the culture of Europe . By picking a fight with President Emmanuel Macron on Twitter upon your arrival in France on Friday, it looks like this is just the beginning of a confrontational weekend.\n\nLimelight: You're in focus\n\nWe assess that you won't be leaving domestic events on US soil. While you participate in ceremonies to mark the end of one brutal war, many may think of your battle at home against the media (whom you've called the enemy of the people), immigrants (whom you've said are invading the US), and Democrats (whom you threatened just minutes after expressing interest in working together after the midterm elections).\n\nAfter your press conference on Wednesday, other leaders probably expect you to play some of your greatest hits this weekend -- including blaming immigrants for violence, criticizing \"fake news\", and praising nationalist leaders. This is probably a cause for concern for leaders like Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and British Prime Minister Theresa May, all of whom espouse more liberal democratic views.\n\nWith you in focus, Putin, however, may be riding high on your divisive rhetoric, attacks on key democratic principles like free speech , and a free press , and what appear to be your attempts to stymie Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. To top it off, you expressed a willingness to hold US lawmaking hostage if House Democrats take actions against you that you don't like.\n\nRose Ceremony: Who's In or Out\n\nSeveral of the leaders present have drifted in and out of your good graces. Putin has remained a favorite, but your bromance with Macron has seemingly been replaced by your affection for Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. While you and Macron hit it off during your last trip to France and his subsequent visit to the White House, you said that you are more closely aligned with Conte than any other G7 leader, Macron, May, and Merkel included. Other leaders are probably wondering how much you will publicly and privately ally with Conte and other nationalist leaders instead of the more liberal, progressive officials. Leaders, including Macron, are likely anxious to see whether you throw them under the bus during public appearances or unscripted press conferences.\n\nFlashpoints: Not Lost in Translation\n\nThere are several potential flashpoints among the dignitaries expected to attend the centennial ceremonies, the most significant of which is the growing divide between liberal democratic leaders and a growing cadre of far right, nationalist ones.\n\nMacron, who is hosting the celebrations, is under pressure. He's facing declining approval ratings and criticism for his handling of issues like unemployment and labor market reforms. He is on a seven-day tour in France to address more local concerns and try to \"reconquer\" French voters\n\nMacron is expected to castigate growing far-right groups ahead of the European Parliamentary elections this spring, especially after their victories in Italy and Sweden. If Macron openly attacks nationalism, he knows that he'll also effectively be criticizing you, after you embraced the same label. While Macron defeated Marine Le Pen in 2017, she has already rebranded the Nationalist Front party and announced her intentions to work with other nationalist groups in next year's European elections. Macron knows that you and Le Pen, along with Conte and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, all share an affinity for securing national borders and stopping immigration. Leaders may have to publicly pick sides.\n\nThe flashpoint over immigration, linked to the divide between nationalists and more progressive liberal democrats, may become apparent during the celebrations. The debate rages on within countries like Germany , and among members of the European Union.\n\nIran sanctions will also probably come up during your encounters. Several of those in attendance are allied against America's new sanctions on Iran, which went into effect this week. Many EU countries, along with Russia and Turkey, can be expected to raise their opposition to them while agreeing with you that Iran is engaged in dangerous activities -- including attempted assassinations on European soil. Your peers will be wondering whether you can work together with them to confront Iran's malign activities in spite of these disagreements.\n\nRussia: Mile High Club\n\nYour fright is Putin's delight -- any signs that you're under pressure or losing control of a cohesive, democratic order will further embolden him. He will think that his mission to sow divisions in the US and undermine the US-led liberal democratic order is bearing real fruit. While you were his preferred candidate for President in 2016, his overarching goal remains a weak America, even if it has you at the helm. In light of increasing divisions in the US and an uptick in political violence and hate crimes, he'll probably be high on life when he arrives in France.", "(CNN) Former first lady Michelle Obama discusses her dislike of President Donald Trump \u2014 as well as personal details of her life before and during her time in the White House \u2014 in her highly anticipated memoir, \"Becoming,\" The Washington Post reported Thursday.\n\nObama says she would \"never forgive\" Trump for the rumors he spread questioning the legitimacy of President Barack Obama's American birth certificate , which she said threatened her family's safety.\n\n\"What if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington?

And for this I'd never forgive him.\"\n\nTrump responded to Obama's book Friday morning, telling reporters: \"She got paid a lot of money to write a book and they always expect a little controversy.\"\n\nHe added that he would never forgive her husband Barack Obama \"for what he did to our US military.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) On the banks of France's Arve river, the horse the Germans could not kill faced his most dangerous mission yet.\n\nThe star-foreheaded Warrior, who arrived on the Western Front in August 1914, had survived four years of shells and bullets, come through the horrors of Ypres, the Somme and Passchendaele, and was now about to lead one of the last great cavalry charges in history.\n\nIn the saddle was General Jack Seely, a flamboyant aristocrat and politician. The pair advanced, galloping at speed for half a mile on muddy terrain before mounting a hill.\n\nBehind the thoroughbred on that morning of March 30, 1918, were 1,000 horses of the Canadian Cavalry; a brigade of cowboys, Mounties, clerks, and Americans. Squadron after squadron followed Seely and Warrior, supported by the Royal Flying Corps which dropped 190 bombs.\n\nMorning turned into a rainy afternoon, then light faded. Warrior survived, as did most of Seely's command, and Moreuil Wood was taken by the Allies, bringing German advancement to a halt.\n\nGeneral Jack Seely on Warrior, painted in 1918 by Sir Alfred Munnings\n\n\"Warrior was the lucky one,\" Brough Scott, journalist and grandson and biographer of Seely, tells CNN.\n\n\"My grandfather was unbelievably lucky with Warrior. One moment he and another horse were standing together, the horses touching noses while other people marched across a bridge, and there was a sniper and the horse next to him was shot dead.\"\n\nGeneral Seely once said of Warrior: \"I have seen him, even when a shell has burst within a few feet, stand still without a tremor -- just turn his head and, unconcerned, look at the smoke of the burst.\"\n\nWarrior returned home to the Isle of Wight in 1918, living on the island off the south coast of England with the Seely family until his death aged 33. Dubbed \"the horse the Germans can't kill,\" by Canadian soldiers, Warrior's obituary would appear in English newspapers The Times and Evening Standard and, in 2014, he posthumously received the Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal, known as the \"animal Victoria Cross.\"\n\nHe is still remembered, still admired. Steven Spielberg, director of War Horse, said during the release of his Oscar-nominated film: \"Warrior is an extraordinary example of the resilience, strength, and profound contribution that horses made to the Great War.\"\n\nDecember 1915: Canadian cavalrymen with drawn swords\n\n'Inspirational stoicism'\n\nThe First World War was a global conflict that defined a century. A four-year battle fought in the fields, the bloodiest in European history, a war which was supposed to end all wars. Sacrifices were made which should never be forgotten, especially the contribution of the stoically silent volunteers regarded as the ultimate war machines.\n\nHorses were the backbone of the Allies' effort, essential to what ultimately would be victory.\n\nThe British Army alone deployed more than a million horses and mules, buying over 617,000 from the US and Canada. Indeed, according to the National Army Museum, Britain sent more hay and oats by weight than ammunition to France.\n\nWhen the war began in 1914, the British Army possessed just 25,000 horses -- within 12 days 140,000 had been purchased.\n\n1917: Canadian troops sit and take a break in a field during a pause in their attack on the Cambrai front, France, Western Front. In the background artillery is moved by soldiers with horses.\n\n\"The British Army had a very organized system in 1914 to sign horses up for the cavalry because they were aware that they would need horses badly,\" says Scott.\n\n\"By 1915, 16,000 horses had come from Tennessee, 2,000 from Uruguay. It was horses everywhere.\n\n\"We can be too sentimental, but what has been obvious, I think, and particularly the reaction I've had about Warrior, because horses can't speak there's a noble, uncomplaining, inspirational stoicism about the horse going about its work.\n\n\"It doesn't have a choice, but will go and work for you and, in many cases, die for you.\"\n\nImmense resources were invested in the horses which had four main roles: Supply horses and mules were used to move ammunition, general supplies and ambulances, riding horses were ridden by soldiers, gun horses pulled artillery pieces and cavalry horses were used in battle. Britain's Remount Department alone spent about $3.9 billion in today's money on purchasing, training and delivering horses and mules to the front.\n\n\"A lot of the times they were standing in makeshift shelters in the fields and things were pretty brutal,\" explains Scott.\n\n\"Horses are bigger targets and you can't make them lie down. They were going all the time. Riding horses you're a big target.\"\n\nBoosting morale\n\nOctober 1915: Canadian cavalry undergo training at Shorncliffe during World War I, riding their horses down the steep slope of a hill.\n\nAs well as being instrumental to the war effort, for the men in battle the war horses were inspirational figures, says Scott, acting as morale boosters in the darkest of times.\n\n\"My grandfather was a flamboyant figure, he would be up near the front when they were parading and marching and very much not hiding and for the troops behind him, seeing the horse up there in front was something they found really inspirational and totemic, he was the ultimate mascot,\" says Scott of Warrior.\n\n\"My grandfather would say that when he rode up to the troops, they were saying 'here comes Warrior.' With a horse, you can go up to it and pat it and say 'good chap.' There's no doubt for those cavalrymen their morale was kept up. Thinking about somebody else is helpful, no question.\"\n\nHorses were, of course, part of everyday life in the early part of the 19th century.\n\n\"Today we forget how much horses were used,\" Emma Mawdsley, an art historian curating an exhibition at the National Army Museum in London on a collection by British war artist Sir Alfred Munnings, one of England's most celebrated equine painters.\n\n\"The success of the British war effort was totally dependent on horses.\n\n\"A new type of war saw men live for months in trenches instead of fighting on the move. Often the mud was so thick motor vehicles could not drive through it. It was left to horses to pull the large artillery guns and ambulances, and bring in supplies of medicine, food and ammunition.\"\n\nA painting by Sir Alfred Munnings, one of England's most celebrated equine painters and whose work will be exhibited at London's National Army Museum this month\n\nThese war horses were, of course, well looked after. New Zealand gunner Bert Stokes would later say: \"To lose a horse was worse than losing a man because ... men were replaceable, while horses weren't at that stage.\"\n\nThere were more than 27,000 men serving in the Army Veterinary Corps and 19,000 in the Remount Department of the British Army preparing horses to be sent to war. Women, too, took their place in the receiving departments.\n\n\"First of all the horses had to be checked for all sorts of diseases and then broken so they could do the ordinary riding and pulling jobs,\" says Scott. \"You'd prepare them so they were ready to do their jobs.\"\n\nThe contribution of the war horses has not been forgotten, says Scott, thanks largely, he says, to Michael Morpurgo's book \"War Horse\" and the film and musical inspired by Morpurgo's story about Joey, a young farm horse which is sold to the British army.\n\n\"Nothing gets anywhere near the contribution of people,\" says Scott. \"You needed manpower but, overwhelmingly, you needed horsepower.\"", "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nThe #MeToo movement was acknowledged in a prestigious art industry power list normally reserved for artists, curators and collectors on Friday.\n\nIn a surprise move, the drive to expose sexual harassment and abuse was named third on ArtReview's 2018 Power 100, an annual ranking of the contemporary art world's most influential people. The movement was joined by high-profile figures like Ai Weiwei, and was the only entry not to comprise an individual, duo or collective.\n\nRelated video: Fashion's new vanguard\n\nThe decision follows a year of high-profile sexual misconduct allegations in the creative industries, which has seen accusations made against photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber\n\nArtReview's website actively names allegations leveled against magazine publisher Knight Landesman, co-owner of the monthly publication Artforum.\n\nRelated video: Ai Weiwei is moving to America\n\nThe list entry explains that \"many of the year's most dramatic shifts in power within the artworld (sic) can be traced to a popular protest against its abuse,\" adding that \"#MeToo changed the prevailing climate in which curators are appointed, prizes awarded and exhibitions framed.\"\n\nNow in its 17th year, ArtReview's Power 100 is chosen by an anonymous jury. Recent years have seen the likes of former Tate director Nicholas Serota and curator Hans Ulrich Obrist named as the contemporary art world's most influential figure.\n\nThis year, Kerry James Marshall was the top-ranked artist, less than a year after his work set a world record for the work of an African American painter. In May, his painting \"Past Times\" sold at auction for $21.1 million, believed to be the highest sum ever paid for the work of a living black artist.\n\nKerry James Marshall is the list's highest ranked artist, finishing second overall.

Roseman/For The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nAn artist biography on the Power 100 website suggests that it was not only painting's sale (made to the musician Sean Combs, also known as P. Diddy) that earned Marshall his place on the list. It was, ArtReview wrote, \"his personal campaign to counter the whitewashing of art history by populating it with black bodies.\"\n\nDespite being this year's highest-ranked artist, Marshall placed second overall in the Power 100, just behind German dealer and gallery owner David Zwirner.", "(CNN) Hunger became starvation and is about to lurch into famine. A failing state failed and an economic crisis became a catastrophe. An insurgency became a civil war and then a regional conflict involving Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOver the past decade, Yemen 's vicious cycle has become a downward spiral -- a predictable and preventable spiral. It is a country \"in freefall,\" says the Norwegian Refugee Council. Eight million people are on the brink of famine. UN officials say that number may quickly rise to more than 12 million -- about half of Yemen's population -- unless the fighting stops.\n\nNearly half a million Yemeni children are chronically malnourished; many are likely to die within the next few months if the conflict continues. Cholera (there were 13,000 cases reported in October alone) and other diseases stalk the land.\n\nA malnourished Yemeni child receives treatment at a hospital in the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah in December. The United Nations has listed Yemen as the world's No. 1 humanitarian crisis.\n\nHow did the poorest country in the Arab world and now one of the poorest on earth reach this nadir? And what if anything can be done to mitigate (let alone reverse) what threatens to become the worst famine anywhere in more than a generation?\n\nDecline and fall\n\nYemen never had much going for it -- few natural resources, a lack of water, endless tribal and civil conflict, religious divides and bad government. But those seem like the good old days. The Arab Spring in 2011 brought protests that turned violent and sparked clan warfare. Yemen's great survivor, President Ali Abdullah Saleh, was critically injured in a rocket attack and replaced. Al Qaeda deepened its presence in several provinces.\n\nIn plotting an abortive comeback, Saleh allied with Houthi rebels from the north, who swept into the capital in September 2014 . Fearing that Iran would use the Houthis as a proxy for its regional ambitions, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates launched what can only be described as a blitzkrieg against Sanaa and other parts of Yemen controlled by the Houthis.\n\nJUST WATCHED Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies 02:52\n\nThe coalition's Operation \"Decisive Storm\" was launched in March 2015. It has been anything but decisive, and rather than vanquish the Houthis the \"storm\" has destroyed infrastructure and targeted -- accidentally or otherwise -- tens of thousands of civilians.\n\nIn a recent study of the coalition's bombing strategy for the World Peace Institute, Martha Mundy said it had \"aimed to destroy food production and distribution\" in areas controlled by the Houthis, with hundreds of strikes against rural targets. Mundy told CNN that economic warfare was aimed at bringing people to their knees -- essentially: \"When we control them, then we'll feed them.\"\n\nAfter being driven out of Sanaa, what remained of the Yemeni government set up in the southern port of Aden. In 2016, it moved the central bank there, and stopped paying the wages of hundreds of thousands of government workers. Those scraping by were suddenly in abject poverty. Inflation stoked by massive printing of money worsened their plight.\n\nA blockade designed to choke off supplies to the Houthis also blocked humanitarian aid, accelerating an economic free fall that had already begun. It also (not coincidentally) made it very difficult for the media to cover the war.\n\nSaudi Arabia's western allies have made indignant noises about the scale and indiscrimination of the coalition's campaign -- but have continued to sign lucrative weapons contracts. The bombs that fall from Saudi aircraft are made in the USA ; the planes are refueled by US aerial tankers. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had overruled staff concerned about the civilian toll in Yemen because it would jeopardize $2 billion in weapons sales\n\nTo the Trump Administration, the larger goal of containing Iran remained more important than ending the war.\n\nIn turn, the Houthis have goaded their enemies with symbolic but useless ballistic missile attacks against Saudi Arabia and committed abuses of their own. They have sequestered thousands of tons of humanitarian aid and often used civilians for cover. Just this week, Amnesty International reported Houthi fighters had taken up positions on the roof a hospital in Hodeidah that is full of injured civilians.\n\nYemen's lifeline\n\nHodeidah, the country's largest port, is now at the center of the conflict. It has been under bombardment for much of the past five months. An estimated 300,000 people have fled the city, adding to the already immense burden of Yemen's internally displaced.\n\nHodeidah and the neighboring provinces account for 40% of the 400,000 children in the country who suffer from severe acute malnutrition, UNICEF says. Aid agency Mercy Corps told CNN that acute malnutrition around Hodeidah has doubled in just the last month. Some areas around the city have seen a five-fold increase in their population.\n\nStill, more than a quarter of a million civilians remain in Hodeidah, and hundreds have been killed since September when heavy fighting resumed. Besides the coalition's airstrikes, aid agencies say that mortar and rocket fire from both sides is exacting a heavy toll.\n\nFrederic Bertrand, head of the Yemen mission of Doctors Without Borders, said Wednesday that attacking forces had \"moved quickly around the city\" in recent days, and it is almost entirely cut off. The Houthis have blocked off roads with shipping containers and cement blocks.\n\nHodeidah is not just any city -- more than 80% of the humanitarian aid desperately needed in Yemen arrives there. The International Committee of the Red Cross says simply: \"Yemen's survival depends on this city.\"\n\nNow it may become the next Mosul, the next Raqqa.\n\nAn end to the fighting\n\nOnly one thing can save Hodeidah, and Yemen: an immediate ceasefire followed by internationally sponsored negotiations, and the free movement of relief supplies.\n\nThere are the first tentative steps toward this: US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week negotiations for a truce should begin within a month. And Secretary Pompeo said that Houthi missile attacks on Saudi soil must stop and \"coalition airstrikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen\" -- his strongest statement yet.\n\nThe UK, another major supplier of arms to the Saudis, echoed the US message.\n\nThe indefatigable UN envoy on Yemen, Martin Griffiths, arranged talks in Switzerland in September, but the Houthi delegation refused to travel, citing security concerns. Another effort is planned for Sweden later this month. The coalition's attack on Hodeidah may be an attempt to take as much ground as possible before negotiations begin.\n\nMercy Corps' Yemen director, Abdikadir Mohamud, says the glimmer of hope offered by recent ceasefire calls is beginning to fade. \"Why wait a month for a ceasefire?\" he asks.\n\nThe Khashoggi effect\n\nRelations between the US and Saudi Arabia have cooled since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe savage irony in all this is that the murder of one man, Jamal Khashoggi, may be prodding Saudi Arabia toward a new approach in Yemen, where 10,000 have been killed (besides the far greater number who have died of hunger.)\n\nThe close relations between the Trump Administration and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have cooled since Khashoggi's killing by Saudi operatives close to the Crown Prince. Sources say there are efforts to surround \"MbS\" with more seasoned advisers. The return of the King's brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, who had been critical of the Yemen campaign while overseas, may also herald a change of policy, according to one diplomatic source.\n\nAli Shihabi of the Arabia Foundation, a Washington institute close to the Saudi court, says the incompetent execution of the campaign \"has exacerbated Yemen's humanitarian crisis and provoked worldwide condemnation.\"\n\n\"The Saudi government will have to prioritize ending this war one way or another,\" Shihabi says.\n\nBut for every day the conflict goes on, many thousands of Yemeni parents watch helplessly as their children waste away. According to the United Nations, one dies every 10 minutes.", "London (CNN) In the run-up to the festive season, British retailers vie to release Christmas TV commercials that will tug heartstrings and open wallets.\n\nBut one supermarket's short cartoon film about an orangutan forced by deforestation to flee its rainforest habitat has been deemed too political for broadcast by the body responsible for vetting commercials.\n\nClearcast -- an organization that approves all commercials before broadcast and which is jointly owned by broadcasters including CNN's parent company, Turner -- said Friday that supermarket Iceland's film breached the UK's ban on political advertising in broadcast media.\n\nThe film, which is voiced by actress Emma Thompson and is called Rang-tan, was originally made by Greenpeace -- and this is a problem for Clearcast.\n\n\"The creative submitted to us is linked to another organization who have not yet been able to demonstrate compliance in this area,\" Clearcast wrote in a statement\n\nIceland has instead published the video on YouTube and released a statement saying its aim was to \"raise awareness\" and \"improve shoppers' understanding of the widespread rainforest destruction for palm oil production, which appears in more than 50% of all supermarket products.\"\n\nThe commercial follows Iceland's announcement in April that it would stop using palm oil in its own-brand products by the end of 2018.\n\nIceland, which owns 900 stores and specializes in frozen foods, will continue to run other commercials on television, but only clips highlighting palm oil-free products, the Guardian reports", "(CNN) After a Marine Corps veteran stormed into a country music dance hall in California and killed 12 people, investigators said there is no clear motive behind the attack.\n\nAuthorities say Ian Long , 28, fired a Glock .45-caliber handgun without a word as patrons line-danced at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks late Wednesday night.

Sometimes we'd go there to have a drink, sit and talk, listen to music,\" said a woman who's been friends with Long for five years and does not want her name made public.\n\nAuthorities have identified a Facebook post believed to have been made by the shooter around the time of the attack, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the ongoing investigation.\n\nIn it, the writer says: \"I hope people call me insane... (laughing emojis).. wouldn't that just be a big ball of irony? Yeah.. I'm insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is 'hopes and prayers'.. or 'keep you in my thoughts'... every time... and wonder why these keep happening...\"\n\nWhen CNN read the post to a friend of Long's, who did not want to be publicly identified, the friend said, \"That does not sound like Ian to me at all. I don't know what was going through his head when he wrote this. It must have been terrible.\"\n\nLong's activities in the days before the shooting remain unknown. He was a corporal in the Marines from August 2008 to March 2013, according to Defense Department records. He went to Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011.\n\nCurtis Kellogg, a friend who served with Long, said the last time he spoke with Long he was headed to Southern California.\n\n\"He was excited to get out so he could go back home, ride his motorcycle again and finish school,\" Kellogg said.\n\nJUST WATCHED California gunman was known to police Replay More Videos ...

The couple separated in 2011 and dissolved the marriage in April 2013 in Ventura County, California. He and his then-wife said they had no children and owned no property.\n\nAfter leaving the Marines in 2013, Long went to college in California but did not complete his degree.\n\nHe was a student at California State University, Northridge, majoring in athletic training from 2013 to 2016, but he did not graduate, university representative Carmen Ramos Chandler said.\n\nThe victims\n\nVentura County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, 54, was among the first officers to arrive at Borderline. He was shot several times as he tried to stop the gunman.\n\nJUST WATCHED Survivor says she survived because of friend Replay More Videos ...

After an apparent smoke bomb went off, Coffman stood up and told his two friends to flee.\n\n\"When he said leave and when he got up, I left,\" DeSon said. \"I saw one opening, and I ran for it. And unfortunately, he wasn't behind me. ... He made sure people were safe, and now we all have a beautiful guardian angel watching over us.\"\n\nSeveral victims had connections to the military.\n\nCoffman was in the process of talking with Army recruiters.\n\nTelemachus Orfanos, 27, was a Navy veteran who survived the Las Vegas massacre last year . After he was killed in this week's California massacre, his mother demanded actions, not words.\n\n\"I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts. I want gun control,\" Susan Orfanos said. \"I hope to God nobody else sends me any more prayers. I want gun control.\"\n\nDan Manrique, 33, was a Marine Corps veteran.\n\nJustin Meek, 23, recently graduated from California Lutheran University and was planning to join the US Coast Guard. He was looking forward to cooking for everyone at the school's Veterans Day Celebration on Monday, Cal Lutheran's veterans coordinator Jenn Zimmerman said.\n\nHe had returned to the school to support the Country Line Dance Club with Borderline.\n\n\"He loved running college night and always seemed to draw a crowd,\" Zimmerman said.\n\nPepperdine student Alaina Housley, 18, was \"an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her,\" her aunt and uncle said.\n\nNoel Sparks, 21, was a gifted dancer and artist, a friend says.\n\nSean Adler, 48, was a bouncer at the dance hall and a former wrestling coach, his team confirmed.\n\nFour other young victims -- Blake Dingman, 21; Jacob Dunham, 21; Mark Meza, 20; and Kristina Morisette, 20 -- were also killed, the Ventura County

China's economy is now growing at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. It's laden down with debt and facing concerns about a real estate bubble and weakening currency.\n\nDespite the Trump administration's new tariffs on $200 billion ofChinese goods, exports are still growing strongly, up 16% in October . But that could change in the coming months if tariffs rise to 25% from 10% at the end of December, as the US has threatened, adding to China's growing list of problems.\n\nRunaway debt\n\nThe Chinese economy expanded rapidly in the years after the global financial crisis thanks to repeated debt binges.\n\n\"China's growth has been highly credit intensive,\" said Gerard Burg, Sydney-based senior economist at National Australia Bank. The total amount of debt in the Chinese financial system is now several times the size of the entire economy\n\nSome of this money has gone into building bridges, road and other infrastructure. But a lot has ended up in less productive parts of the economy, such as big, inefficient state-run companies. The more dynamic private sector hasn't benefited as much.\n\nLate last year, Beijing stepped up its efforts to rein in the high levels of debt, which is one of the main reasons the economy is now losing momentum.\n\nSome analysts are skeptical about the Chinese government's commitment to cleaning up its financial system, especially as the slowdown deepens and the trade war intensifies.\n\nMany provincial governments and state-run firms would struggle to stay above water without regular injections of cheap credit, according to Kevin Lai, an economist at investment bank Daiwa Capital Markets.\n\nCutting off their credit lines \"would have very negative repercussions, like social unrest, layoffs and bankruptcies,\" Lai said. That's a scenario Beijing wants to avoid.\n\nPlunging currency\n\npressure on has sunk more than 9% against the dollar since January. It's been The government is also trying to fend offpressure on China's yuan , whichhas sunk more than 9% against the dollar since January. It's been hurt by concerns about the health of the Chinese economy and rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve that have pushed up the greenback.\n\nThe weaker yuan has boosted China's huge export industry, as it makes Chinese products cheaper on global markets. But slumps in the yuan have caused headaches in the past.\n\nAmid sharp declines in 2015 and 2016, vast sums of money flooded out of China as investors bet the yuan would keep falling. The crisis forced Beijing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up its currency.\n\nThe yuan has sunk more than 9% against the dollar since January.\n\nA rapidly falling yuan could become a vicious cycle, according to Manu Bhaskaran, the founder of Singapore-based research firm Centennial Asia.\n\n\"There could be a huge capital outflow and that could feed on itself,\" he said.\n\nBeijing appears to have again started dipping into its massive war chest of foreign currencies in recent months to slow the yuan's declines, according to research firm Capital Economics.\n\nReal estate bubble\n\nAnother threat lurks in the country's overheated property market.\n\nPrices have more than doubled in the past decade, according to research firm Gavekal, stoked by low interest rates and a shortage of housing in major cities.\n\nBut the real estate market now \"appears to be showing some cracks,\" said Aidan Yao, a senior emerging markets economist at AXA Investment Managers. He pointed to some instances of big property developers slashing prices in the face of weakening demand.\n\nChinese officials have struggled to rein in skyrocketing prices in cities like Beijing.\n\n\"It is only a matter of time before the market cools,\" Yao added.\n\nThe real estate industry has been one of the few bright spots for China's economy this year but turn into a burden if it slumps, according to analysts at research firm Fitch Solutions.\n\n\"This will add another layer of pressure,\" they wrote in a note to clients last month.\n\nChronic problems\n\nChinese officials have turned to tax cuts, infrastructure spending and looser monetary policy as they seek to prop up growth . But some experts think these are the wrong prescriptions for the country's economic woes.\n\n\"China's problems are chronic, not acute,\" said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nIn his view, the major issues, such as China's rapidly aging population and uncompetitive business environment, are being largely ignored.\n\nBut those moves have come too late or don't go far enough, raising serious concerns about China's long-term economic future, according to Scissors.\n\n\"Old, indebted economies don't grow,\" he said", "Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says he disagrees with Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker's 2017 statements that Russia had no influence in the 2016 Presidential election and adds that he believes Trump installed Whitaker as AG to \"gain access\" to evidence Mueller has in the Russia probe.", "02:33\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \"\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647\u0627\" \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629.. \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a\u061f", "CNN political analyst and Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein blasts President Trump for his conduct at a heated press conference the day after the midterm elections and scrutinizes his understanding of the rule of law in the United States.", "Written by Zhou Tiehai Shanghai\n\nZhou Tiehai is the founder of the West Bund Art & Design Fair.\n\nShanghai's art scene has undergone a transformation in the past decade, with an explosion of new galleries, art fairs, cultural centers and creative spaces opening in the city. These venues, some of which are housed in disused factories and manufacturing plants, see contemporary art co-existing and interacting with the city's industrial past.\n\nArtist Zhou Tiehai has been at the forefront of developments, having advised the pioneering international art fair, SH Contemporary in 2007, and founded the West Bund Art & Design Fair in 2014. The fair's fifth edition , which runs through the weekend, will exhibit work from more than 100 leading galleries from across the world.\n\nTo help navigate Shanghai's ever-evolving arts landscape, he gave CNN Style a rundown of the best art spaces in the city. Here are Zhou's top picks, in his own words.\n\nPower Station of Art (PSA)\n\nThe Power Station of Art is, as the name might suggest, a former power plant. The renovation retained much of the building's original industrial frame, including its iconic 165-meter-high (541-foot) chimney, resulting in a large and unique exhibition space. The versatile design encourages varied forms of artistic creativity, while offering visitors a multi-layered art experience.\n\nPower Station of Art Shanghai\n\nSince opening in 2012, PSA has showcased the work of contemporary Chinese and foreign artists, such as Cai Guoqiang, Huang Yongping, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, and Christian Boltanski, as well as solo exhibitions by internationally renowned architects like Balkrishna Doshi, Renzo Piano, Yona Friedman, Toyo Ito, and Kazunari Sakamooto. PSA is the main venue for the Shanghai Biennale, while the Power Station of Design (PSD) hosts international exhibitions exploring the design of everything from jewelry to airplanes.\n\nFosun Foundation\n\nThe Fosun Foundation Art Center is located on Shanghai's historic waterfront district, the Bund. Jointly designed by British architecture firms Foster+Partners and Heatherwick Studio, the building is best known for its facade, a moving, curtain-like exterior inspired by traditional Chinese theaters.\n\nThe center's owners have committed to showing work by major international artists, including Julian Opie and A.R. Penck. Early next year, the space is set to host a solo exhibition by Yayoi Kusama featuring a number of new pieces by the celebrated Japanese artist. In the meantime, head to the building's rooftop, where you can see not only the works of sculptor Miyajima Tatsuo, but also the urban scenery found either side of the Huangpu River.\n\nRockbund Art Museum\n\ncourtesy rockbund art museum\n\nThe Rockbund Art Museum is set in a grand Art Deco-style building dating back to 1932. British architect David Chipperfield restored and reconstructed the structure, keeping much of its original facade while significantly expanding the usable space inside.\n\nChina's most 'passionate' city\n\nOpened in 2010, the museum's curatorial and educational programs respond to issues facing both the local and international communities. It has hosted solo shows and in-depth group exhibitions by renowned Chinese and international artists like Song Dong, Lin Tianmiao, Philippe Parreno and Felix-Gonzalez-Torres. The Rockbund also exhibits the Hugo Boss Asia Art Award finalists' show, one of Asia's most influential exhibitions.\n\nLong Museum West Bund\n\nLong Museum China Credit: Courtesy Long Museum\n\nThe Long Museum, in Shanghai's burgeoning West Bund district, was founded by the art collector couple Liu Yiqian and Wang Wei. The space -- which is not to be confused with another of the museum's outposts in Shanghai's Pudong district -- was designed by Chinese architect Liu Yichun, and is set across a sprawling 350,000-square-foot site.\n\nThe newly designed complex incorporated many features of the original wharf once found on this site. Based on its owners' private collection, the museum continues to showcase important artists from home and abroad, such as Ding Yi, Yu Youhan, Yang Fudong, Anthony Gormley, James Turrell and Olafur Eliasson. A solo exhibition by Louise Bourgeois opens early November as the district hosts its annual art fair, West Bund Art & Design.\n\nYuz Museum\n\nCourtesy Yuz Museum\n\nThe Yuz Museum opened in the West Bund district in 2014, transforming what was once a hangar of the defunct Shanghai Longhua Airport. The original structure was expanded with a floor-to-ceiling glass hall, making the space's appearance simultaneously contemporary and historic.\n\nBased on the private collection of its owner, Budi Tek, the museum balances contemporary work with important artists from art history, such as Giacometti. The museum is also renowned for interactivity, presenting large walk-through installations like the world-famous \"Rain Room\" (pictured top).\n\nM50 Art District\n\nShangART Gallery Credit: Photo by Hao Chen\n\nLocated near the banks of the Wusong River, the M50 Art District is the oldest state-sanctioned art \"zone\" in Shanghai. Since 2000, a steady stream of artists, designers and galleries have settling there (including my own studio, which has been in the area for almost 20 years).\n\nThe old factory site has borne witness to the development of Shanghai's flourishing art scene, hosting notable galleries and art institutions like Vanguard Gallery, Antenna Space, Chronus Art Center, the CC Foundation and ShanghART Gallery. Each of these have brought high-quality exhibitions from various domestic and foreign artists.\n\nWest Bund Museum Mile\n\nCourtesy West Bund Shanghai\n\nThe West Bund is the best place to stand and look over the Huangpu River. It's also home to a number of the city's popular art galleries and museums. Starting from the Long Museum and moving along the river you'll come to 2879 Longteng Avenue on your right-hand side. The building is home to Made In Gallery, Edouard Malingue Gallery, Arario Gallery and Don Gallery.\n\nContinuing along past the aforementioned Yuz Museum and you'll reach another distinguished address, 2555 Longteng Avenue, which includes the Shanghai Center of Photography, Qiao Space, ShanghART Gallery, Aike-Dellarco, OTA Fine Arts and the Pond Society, adjacent to the West Bund Art Center.\n\nShanghai Museum of Glass\n\nCourtesy Shanghai Museum of Glass\n\nThe Shanghai Museum of Glass is located on the original site of glass manufacturer and has since become one of the city's must-see museums. The museum recently invited Tilman Th\u00fcrmer his Shanghai design firm, Coordination Asia, to renovate the space, which retained original features from factory while introducing new facilities.\n\nInside the museum, you can learn how glass is processed and produced. Artists Liu Jianhua, Yang Fudong, Yang Zhenzhong and Zhang Ding have established their studios at the museum, producing sculptures and installations using glass and other materials.", "If your day doesn't start until you've gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

It ended in absolute horror. The victims in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, were part of the huge crowd line dancing and having a great time at the bar's college night. Then a man dressed in a black trench coat and glasses, later identified as Ian David Long opened fire . When it was all over 12 people, including a sheriff's deputy, were dead.\n\nThis latest mass shooting feels especially painful because many of the victims were so young . College students just trying to enjoy a night out. Grief stricken parents talked of desperately searching for their children , only to learn their loved ones had perished in the violence. And the nation is left, once again, searching for answers to gun violence after witnessing a fourth shooting in just two weeks.\n\nThe shooting is not the only calamity that folks in the area are dealing with. Parts of a town right next to Thousand Oaks had to be evacuated because of a brush fire burning through Ventura County . The blaze has charred almost 10,000 acres so far. And that's not the only wildfire burning in the state. About 40,000 people in Northern California evacuated to get away from the fast-growing Camp Fire, which has burned 20,000 acres in Butte County.\n\n2. Russia investigation\n\nMatthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, probably won't recuse himself from the Russia investigation that he's now overseeing. That's a problem for a lot of people, who say his past comments -- in which he expressed deep skepticism about the probe -- should disqualify him from leading the investigation. Others say Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because he hasn't been confirmed by the Senate. Several senior White House officials told CNN they're worried the backlash might jeopardize Whitaker's chances of staying in the job.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sources: Whitaker has no plans to recuse himself Replay More Videos ...

A big part of the problem is that the Afghan army is dealing with a huge personnel shortfall in the face of the determined, sustained Taliban insurgency.

Here, the Skydive Diani team are one of the only fully operational Skydiving centers on the continent, outside South Africa.\n\nSource: CNN", "London (CNN) It's a stark prognosis: To save the world from the worst effects of climate change, it's likely not enough to cut carbon dioxide emissions; we need to start scrubbing carbon pollution from the atmosphere, too.\n\nAnd not just a little bit of carbon. Vast amounts of it\n\nThe problem is, the jury is still out on whether that's even possible.\n\nLast month, a report from the global authority on climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warned of the catastrophic consequences likely to result if humans cause global temperatures to rise more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The group also said that if we want to stay below the 1.5 degree limit, we'll need to use technologies that remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air.\n\nBut the report noted that carbon removal at the scale that's likely required is \"unproven and reliance on such technology is a major risk in the ability to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\" In other words, don't solely bank on an unproven technology when your future is on the line.\n\nBurning fuel to clean the air\n\nJust how much CO2 we need to pull from the air depends on how much of that heat-trapping gas we keep pumping into the atmosphere.\n\nIf we fail to make dramatic cuts -- which is how things stand with current global emissions pledges -- by the end of the century we might need to remove a total of around 30 times the CO2 that the world currently emits each year, according to the IPCC report.\n\nThere are many methods we might use to remove CO2 from the air, from the low-tech -- simply planting more trees -- to the speculative -- adding iron to the oceans to speed the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by microscopic plant life.\n\nBut one method that's got a lot of attention from IPCC scientists is known as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage, or BECCS. Essentially, it means growing bioenergy crops and then burning them at power stations to create energy, while capturing the CO2 that's emitted.\n\nWhen the bioenergy crops grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. As long as the CO2 captured when they are burned is safely stored, the process is considered carbon negative.\n\nOf course, it's not quite that simple. Growing, collecting, transporting and processing the crops will have a carbon footprint, but advocates believe that if the process is well managed, BECCS can be an important tool in removing atmospheric CO2.\n\nAlong with tree planting, BECCS is the CO2 removal method most used by the IPCC in its scenarios for limiting global warming.\n\nNiall MacDowell, who leads the Clean Fossil and Bioenergy Research Group at Imperial College, London, says: \"BECCS tends to come out as the preferred technology in many of the scenarios because in addition to removing CO2 from the atmosphere, it also generates power and is therefore a more cost-effective way to deliver these negative emissions.\"\n\nThe problem with BECCS\n\nInevitably, BECCS has its drawbacks.\n\nAs well as the difficulties in ensuring the bioenergy is carbon neutral, there is the problem of carbon capture.\n\n\"There are very few examples of carbon capture and storage at large-scale power generating facilities that have come in on cost and work as expected,\" says Glen Peters, research director at the Center for International Climate Research, in Norway.\n\n\"Large-scale\" is the key adjective here for carbon capture, but even more so for bioenergy.\n\nIn some emission scenarios, a land area bigger than India would be needed to grow the required bioenergy crops. That land might otherwise be used for forestry or to produce the food needed by a growing global population. Then there's the question of how much water is needed, and how much carbon is released by converting land for growing bioenergy crops.\n\nBut MacDowell has studied the potential for BECCS to be rolled out at scale and believes it is possible, in theory at least.\n\n\"My research indicates it can work but you have to be very careful to do it the right way,\" he says.\n\n\"If one were not careful to astutely manage and optimize the entire supply chain, starting from land that's used for production of biomass right the way across the supply chain to harvesting and processing and final conversion to an energy product and effective sequestration of the CO2, then it might not work.\"\n\nBut on top of the land needed to grow the crops, there is the land needed to store the CO2 indefinitely, and the infrastructure needed to move the CO2 there.\n\nPower station pilot\n\nSo is BECCS a dead end? A dangerous distraction from the crucial business of cutting emissions? Some argue exactly that. Others see huge potential.\n\nThere are some small BECCS projects already running, but this month, a facility in the north of England is set to become the first power station in the world to start piloting the technology.\n\nDrax power station provides about 6% of the UK power supply. When it opened in the 1970s it burned only coal but these days, four of its six generators are powered solely by biomass.\n\nBiomass domes at Drax.\n\nIt claims that by using sustainably sourced biomass from managed forests in the United States, it saves at least 80% of the CO2 it would have emitted by burning coal (the missing 20% is down to supply chain emissions).\n\nRemember, burning biomass still emits CO2 (actually, slightly more than coal, per unit of energy produced), but if Drax can capture that and either reuse or store it, then in theory, the process becomes carbon negative. Power generation that actually removes atmospheric CO2.\n\nDrax is working with a local company called C-Capture, which has developed a chemical to trap the CO2 from its biomass flue gases. The technology has been tested in the lab and the plan is to trial it at the power station.\n\nIf Drax were to scale up the technology, Drax Power CEO Andy Koss says a pipeline could be built to deliver the CO2 to disused North Sea oil or gas fields or aquifers, for long-term sequestration.\n\nThe biomass pellets used at Drax\n\nIf other power stations and heavy industries in the region were to also implement carbon capture, Koss says they could hook up to the same pipeline, driving down costs.\n\nBut experts say that at the moment there's little economic incentive for large BECCS projects, and that governments should be providing more support.\n\nThe risk we're taking\n\nKoss sees scope for some large-scale BECCS deployment around the world, but acknowledges there are limits to the amount of sustainable biomass that can be produced.\n\nIf BECCS has a role to play in carbon removal, it will need to be alongside other methods.\n\n\"The least helpful thing we can do at the moment is get captured by some sort of hype cycle where we get overly excited by one technology,\" says MacDowell.\n\nWhen it comes to fighting climate change, experts say the priority must still be to reduce emissions immediately.\n\nPeters warns of the dangers of us cutting emissions too slowly, in the hope that an unproven technology will one day make up for our inaction.\n\n\"The IPCC scenarios (for reducing emissions) are based on the assumption that we have large-scale negative emissions,\" he says. \"The risk there is that we're choosing a pathway today that depends on us having this technology in the future -- if we don't have this technology, future generations will pay the consequences.\"", "02:33\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \"\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647\u0627\" \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629.. \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a\u061f", "London (CNN) Any visitor of Manchester will know that the streets are divided by blue and red -- the colors of arch-rivals Manchester City and Manchester United.\n\nMusic lovers will also recognize it as a hotbed of talent, led by 1990s superstars Oasis and The Stone Roses.\n\nNow the two worlds are colliding, thanks to Bands FC, a duo that creates artistic interpretations of football crests blended with band names.\n\n\"Football teams have far better designers than bands do,\" explains Manchester-native Nick Fraser, one of the Bands FC founders.\n\nSince kicking off in June, Bands FC has created 500 crests, while raising \u00a345,000 ($59,0000) for charity, Fraser says.\n\nTheir exhibit is currently touring through Manchester's National Football Museum, right on time for the Mancunian derby kicking-off this Sunday at Etihad Stadium.\n\n\"I love it when they play each other, because this city comes alive with people from all over the place,\" says Fraser, who has worked with bands in music festivals, \"but I'm not going to be heartbroken about any result.\"\n\nThat's because he and his Bands FC partner Mark Liptrott, a graphic designer and art teacher, both swore off football fandom early on.\n\n\"I absolutely love football,\" Fraser says, \"but I saw what happened when you supported a team, you'd get absolutely harangued by the other team. I couldn't take being on the receiving end.\"\n\n\"You don't lose a gig, so that's why I got into music,\" he adds. \"The fact that we're not partisan football fans means we can be objective with the designs.\"\n\nOasis and Stone Roses\n\n'Teams love them'\n\nThe exhibit features Manchester City superfans Oasis on the team's crest, with a sinking gold Rolls-Royce replacing the traditional gold ship in homage to the band's \"Be Here Now\" album cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Manchester United's red devil is given a modern makeover, with The Stone Roses replacing the club's name on the crest.\n\nMany of the designs are made with clever hidden references, like Death Cab for Cutie replacing Derby County FC on the team's logo (check their initials).\n\nOthers include AC/DC, complete with cannon, invading Arsenal's red crest, Blur colliding with Chelsea's badge and Brookyln's Beastie Boys taking over the classic New York Cosmos swirl.\n\nParisian robotic DJ duo Daft Punk personally thanked Bands FC for their interpretation of the Paris Saint-Germain logo, marked by hidden robo-helmets shaping the outline of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nSo far no word from the surviving members of the Beatles, perhaps because they were placed on the crest of Spanish club Villarreal rather one of their nearby clubs, Liverpool or Everton.\n\nThe Beatles crest has \"20 references\" says Fraser, the most obvious being Villarreal's nickname: The Yellow Submarine. Liverpool FC's crest went to Liverpudlian band Echo & The Bunnymen instead.\n\nConsidering Bands FC cheerily redesign the logos of well-established clubs, they have hired an intellectual property lawyer in case of any trouble. So far nothing has come up.\n\n\"The football teams absolutely love them, we've been bugged by teams to make them,\" Fraser says, adding they would pull down a badge the moment a team asked them to.\n\nHe doesn't see it happening, though. \"You would be seen as the biggest spoilsports in sport,\" he says.\n\nJUST WATCHED COPA90: Gabriel Jesus - From favela to the PL Replay More Videos ...

On November 9, 1938, the Nazis inflicted on Germany a night of systematic violence, against synagogues, Jewish-owned shops, and Jewish homes,\" Philippe wrote in a post on Facebook\n\n\"The ominous sound of broken windows gave its name to this terrible episode in history: the Night of Broken Glass.\n\n\"Why remember, in 2018, such a painful memory?\n\nJewish-owned shops and businesses were destroyed across Germany on Kristallnacht.\n\n\"Because we are very far from having finished with anti-Semitism. I have just read the most recent figures in relation to the rise of anti-Semitic acts in our country. They cannot be ignored. While they were declining over the past two years, these acts have now increased by more than 69% in the first nine months of 2018.\"\n\nAfter a record year in 2015, anti-Semitic acts fell sharply, by 58%, in 2016. They continued to fall in 2017, decreasing by 7%, though this masked an increase in violent acts targeting Jews.\n\nThe nature of anti-Semitic acts has changed drastically in recent years, manifesting itself in violence that has seen 11 people since killed since 2006.\n\nIn 2015, a gunman killed four people in a kosher supermarket in Paris as a horrified world watched on television. Three years earlier, four people including three young children were gunned down in an attack on a Jewish school in Toulouse, shocking the country.\n\nThis year, hundreds took to the streets to protest after Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old French Holocaust survivor, was murdered in her apartment in what French authorities have described as an anti-Semitic hate crime.\n\nPhilippe says the government will now step up its fight against anti-Semitism, racism and homophobia, calling on every French citizen to \"mobilize for life together, for the identity of France and for the values of the Republic.\"\n\nMireille Knoll an 85-year-old, was murdered in an anti-Semitic attack earlier this year.\n\nPhilippe announced the mobilization of a national team tasked with educating children in schools across the country on the dangers of anti-Semitism.\n\nHe also promised to make tackling online hate speech a national priority, as well as introducing an anti-racism prize named after Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old tortured and murdered in an anti-Semitic attack in 2006.\n\nThere are also plans for an online complaint procedure to allow users to register attacks with authorities.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Francis Kalifat, president of CRIF, the umbrella body for the French Jewish community, said it was time for action rather than more plans.\n\n\"Our first observation is that violent acts are a daily occurrence and they have existed for a long time,\" Kalifat said.\n\n\"We want the fight against anti-Semitism to be treated differently so that it is no longer treated with other hateful acts. Because all hateful acts do not spring from the same place.\n\n\"Our second observation is that we keep going from 'government plan' to 'government plan' but the figures show that this succession of 'plans' doesn't give results. It's time to stop the 'plans' and take action.\"\n\nPhilippe's announcement comes a day after the French government backed down over apparent plans to pay tribute to Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain - - who collaborated with the Nazis in the deportation of Jews from France during World War II -- as part of commemorations to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the 85-year-old Holocaust survivor who was murdered.", "A single image shows 25 members of a platoon boarding a train for the front.

Hacia las 2:00 p.m. hora local, el incendio ya hab\u00eda crecido hasta abarcar m\u00e1s de 7.000 hect\u00e1reas.\n\nImpulsado por los vientos, el incendio forestal brinc\u00f3 las colinas de Pulga y Concow y lleg\u00f3 hasta Paradise, una localidad de 26.000 personas a 130 kil\u00f3metros de Sacramento. Los habitantes despertaron con el hedor del humo y el horizonte matutino envuelto en un color naranja cenizo por el que era dif\u00edcil ver o conducir, lo que oblig\u00f3 a comenzar las evacuaciones.\n\nHacia las 8 a.m. del jueves, Tanah Clunies-Ross, habitante de Paradise, dijo que no pod\u00eda ver su auto desde la entrada de su casa debido al humo. Un fuego hab\u00eda comenzado en su jard\u00edn, bloqueando el camino hacia su auto.

Al menos dos bomberos y varios civiles han resultado heridos, pero a\u00fan no se han hecho p\u00fablicas cifras oficiales, dijo el jueves Bill Reid, jefe del cuerpo de bomberos del condado de Butte.\n\nEl fuego oblig\u00f3 a la evacuaci\u00f3n de los pacientes del principal hospital de Paradise, quienes fueron llevados a hospitales en Oroville y Chico. Unos 3.300 estudiantes y trabajadores de 11 escuelas de Paradise fueron evacuados en autobuses y en los autos de los empleados a un centro en Chico, dijo Tim Taylor, superintendente de los colegios del condado de Butte.\n\nUnos 500 bomberos se encuentran en la zona y 100 agentes de la polic\u00eda los est\u00e1n ayudando, dijo el capit\u00e1n John Gaddie. Cal Fire ya llam\u00f3 a m\u00e1s bomberos.\n\nVarios edificios han quedado destruidos en Paradise, dijo Gaddie.

After all, they don't exactly provide nutritious calories, and consuming them can make it increasingly more challenging to lose weight. But that doesn't stop people from asking me, \"what is the best drink to have on a diet?\"\n\nClearly, some alcoholic beverages are more waistline-friendly than others. So the short answer is: If you're looking to shed pounds, some of your lowest-calorie bets are a shot of spirits (for example, a 1.5-ounce shot of vodka, gin, rum, whiskey or tequila contains an average of 97 calories), a glass of champagne (about 84 calories per 4 ounces); a glass of dry wine (approximately 120 to 125 calories per 5 ounces) or a traditional martini, with an average of 124 calories for a 2.5-ounce serving. A light beer (approximately 100 calories) or a glass of reduced-calorie wine (about 90 to 100 calories) are other lower-calorie options.\n\nBut if you want to know why some alcoholic beverages contain more calories than others, read on.\n\nPure alcohol contains 7 calories per gram -- that's less than a gram of fat, which has 9 calories, but more than protein and carbs, which have 4 calories per gram each -- but other variables of your drink influence the calorie count. The amount of alcohol, the total volume of a beverage, the amount of carbohydrates and sugars and mixers all play a role.\n\nGenerally speaking, the biggest difference in calories in beverages comes from the alcohol content, but the presence of carbohydrates in alcoholic beverages also contributes largely to its calories, according to Dwayne Bershaw, who teaches winemaking classes in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa reconocida serie de crimen de AMC sobre Walter White, un maestro enfermo convertido en narcotraficante, se transmiti\u00f3 de 2008 a 2013.\n\n(CNN) - S\u00ed, parece que la serie \"Breaking Bad\" tendr\u00e1 su propia pel\u00edcula.\n\nLa estrella de la serie Bryan Cranston apareci\u00f3 en el episodio del mi\u00e9rcoles del programa de radio \"The Dan Patrick Show\" y confirm\u00f3 el proyecto.\n\n\"S\u00ed, parece que hay una versi\u00f3n en cine de 'Breaking Bad', pero honestamente no he le\u00eddo el gui\u00f3n\", dijo Cranston. \"No he recibido el gui\u00f3n, no he le\u00eddo el gui\u00f3n.

He kept his eye on the gunman, and when he paused to reload, Appleby whispered to others that it was time to rush to the exit.\n\n\"I said, 'We go,' and we ran,\" he said. \"I don't know how I survived because at any moment, I could have been shot.\"\n\nShe followed her friend's orders and lived\n\nSarah Rose Deson was at the club for her friend's birthday. When the gunman burst in, her friend, Cody Coffman, yelled for her to get down.\n\n\"I fell to the floor and hid behind him and just tucked myself in his back,\" she said. There was \"a bunch of sparks and smoke everywhere,\" she said. Coffman soon told her it was time to get out.\n\nPeople wait in line to give blood for the victims of Wednesday night's shooting.\n\n\"I don't even remember in this blur, but I ran for my life,\" Deson said.\n\nShe got out through the front entrance -- the same one the shooter had stormed through moments earlier. She tumbled down in the parking lot, got up and kept running until she got to a nearby gas station.\n\n\"He's one of the reasons that I'm here right now,\" she said. \"I didn't know what to do. I just followed him, I dropped down and I hid with him. I know he was put in my life for a reason.

I love you. I'll talk to you later,'\" Dean said.\n\nWithin two minutes, he was on the scene. The gunman was still firing.\n\nHelus and a highway patrol officer rushed into the bar and exchanged gunfire with the shooter, Dean said.\n\nHelus was shot several times before an officer pulled him out and waited for reinforcements, he said.\n\nA car in a procession carries the body of Ventura County sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus.\n\nPolice waited close to 15 minutes, until the shots died down, and regrouped with more officers, Dean said. They went into the bar and found the shooter -- Ian David Long , 28, a former US Marine, according to police -- had fatally shot himself next to the bar entrance.\n\nThe scene was \"like hell\" when deputies arrived, Dean said. Police found patrons hiding in the attic. Some were so terrified, they asked officers to confirm they weren't the gunman, he said.\n\nOutside the bar, frantic parents waited for word of their children.

El auto ardi\u00f3 en llamas antes de que un hombre saliera de \u00e9l y empezara a atacar gente en la calle, dijo la polic\u00eda.\n\nCuando la polic\u00eda lleg\u00f3 al lugar, el hombre golpe\u00f3 a uno de los agentes a trav\u00e9s de la ventanilla de su coche patrulla, dijo el comisionado jefe de la polic\u00eda de Victoria, Graham Ashton a reporteros el viernes. El hombre los embisti\u00f3 con un cuchillo cuando salieron del veh\u00edculo. Uno de los agentes le dispar\u00f3 en el pecho.\n\nEl sospechoso fue llevado a un hospital bajo custodia de la polic\u00eda y muri\u00f3 posteriormente. Latas de gas lacrim\u00f3geno fueron encontradas en el auto.\n\nLa polic\u00eda dijo que ten\u00eda conocimiento del sospechoso, pero declin\u00f3 identificarlo debido a \"razones operativas\". \u00c9l era conocido por las autoridades debido a que algunos de sus familiares eran \"personas de inter\u00e9s\", dijo Ashton.\n\nFue hasta que el hombre fue abatido que la polic\u00eda se dio cuenta que tres personas del p\u00fablico, todos hombres, fueron apu\u00f1aladas. Uno muri\u00f3 en el hospital, dijo Ashton. Dos est\u00e1n siendo tratados por sus heridas.\n\nLa investigaci\u00f3n sigue en sus primeras etapas, pero Ashton dijo que la polic\u00eda no cre\u00eda que existiera una \"amenaza continua\".\n\n\"Es una cosa terrible y malvada la que ha ocurrido\", dijo el primer ministro del estado de Victoria, Daniel Andrews.\n\nISIS reivindica el ataque\n\nEl grupo terrorista ISIS reivindic\u00f3 el ataque del viernes en Melbourne a trav\u00e9s de la agencia de noticias Amaq, su ala medi\u00e1tica, de acuerdo con el grupo de inteligencia SITE.\n\nCNN no pudo verificar de forma independiente esta reivindicaci\u00f3n y no se dio evidencia que la respalde.\n\nEl mensaje citado por SITE dice que el sospechoso abatido era un combatiente \"del Estado Isl\u00e1mico y \u00e9l realiz\u00f3 la operaci\u00f3n en respuesta a los ciudadanos objetivo de los estados de la coalici\u00f3n\".", "Hong Kong (CNN Business) News anchors, beware. The robots are coming for your jobs, too.\n\nChina's state news agency has debuted a virtual anchor designed to be able to deliver the news 24 hours a day.\n\nXinhua unveiled its \"artificial intelligence news anchor\" Wednesday at an internet conference in the eastern city of Wuzhen.\n\n\"Hello, you are watching English news program. I am AI news anchor in Beijing,\" the computer-generated host announced in a robotic voice at that start of its English-language broadcast.\n\nXinhua AI anchor, launched on Wednesday, starts presenting news reports from Thursday. In this program, he takes you to have a look at what a Panama official and the Chinese businessman Jack Ma say about the ongoing #CIIE . pic.twitter.com/OZkRQtv1sQ\n\nDeveloped by Xinhua and Chinese search engine company Sogou, the anchor was designed to simulate human voice, facial expressions and gestures.\n\nThe AI news reader \"learns from live broadcasting videos by himself and can read texts as naturally as a professional news anchor,\" according to Xinhua.\n\nThe news agency said the simulations can be used on its website and social media platforms and will \"reduce news production costs and improve efficiency.\"\n\nIt didn't say whether any of China's state-run TV channels have shown interest in acquiring the technology into for usage into the future.\n\nThe English-speaking anchor, complete with a suit and tie, is modeled on a real-life Xinhua anchor called Zhang Zhao.\n\n\"I will work tirelessly to keep you informed as texts will be typed into my system uninterrupted,\" it said in an introductory video\n\nA Chinese-language version, which is based on another real-life Xinhua anchor, was also unveiled at the conference.\n\nUsers of China's micro-blogging site Weibo were not completely convinced by the virtual presenter.\n\n\"(His) voice is too stiff, and there are problems with the pauses,\" said one user.\n\n\"Apparently, news anchors have to lose their jobs,\" said another.\n\nChina operates one of the most aggressive media censorship regimes in the world and has tightened restrictions on domestic and foreign news outlets under President Xi Jinping. But that hasn't stopped its newsrooms from innovating.\n\nWhile Xinhua claims the virtual anchor is a world first, it is not the first time that Chinese media has experimented with AI technology.\n\nIn 2015, China's Dragon TV used Microsoft's XiaoIce chatbot to deliver a weather report on its live breakfast show. The AI computer program delivered the forecast in a \"cute\" female voice, according to Xinhua.\n\nAutomated reporting has proliferated in recent years. The Associated Press wire service is just one major news organization that uses sophisticated computer algorithms to write thousands of automated stories a year.\n\nAdvanced software programs scrape

structure loss, with more than 6,700 structures gone in two days, according to Cal Fire, the state's fire-fighting agency.\n\nThe large Camp Fire in Northern California, which obliterated 80% to 90% of the homes in one town, has left at least nine people dead, officials said Friday. Kory Honea, the Butte County sheriff, said 35 people have been reported missing in the Camp Fire.\n\nThe fast-moving wildfires in the state have destroyed thousands of structures and prompted thousands of residents to flee, sometimes through jam-packed flame-lined streets that forced evacuees to chose whether to try to drive to safety or to get out and run.\n\nThe Camp Fire left the mayor of Paradise, population 26,000, in shock.\n\n\"There's really not much left. There are very few homes still standing and we've been in multiple different neighborhoods this afternoon,\" Mayor Jody Jones said. She estimated only 10 to 20% of homes are left.\n\nFour people were found dead in vehicles that were overcome by flames and one body was discovered near the vehicles, the Butte County Sheriff's Office said. The other victims were found near or inside homes that burned.\n\nTwo major fires in Southern California are just miles from the bar where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, and evacuations were ordered for nearby Malibu, a seaside city popular with celebrities.\n\nAuthorities have received reports of two fatalities in the city of Malibu, and the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's office said it was working to confirm whether they are related to the wildfires.\n\nFanned by high winds and fueled by low humidity and dry vegetation, the fires spread rapidly Thursday and overnight into Friday. The threat continued Friday, with millions of Californians under \"red flag\" warnings portending windy arid and warm conditions that pose extreme fire risks.\n\nHere's what we know about the trio of fires:\n\nCamp Fire: People flee 'carrying their babies and kids'\n\nIn Northern California, panicked residents began fleeing Paradise on Thursday as the Camp Fire swept through it.\n\nBy Friday morning, the town's main road was littered with downed trees and power lines. Much of the brush and grasses were blackened along the valleys, and many trees were still burning, a CNN crew there observed.\n\nA family that evacuated Thursday by driving along flame-lined roads posted a startling video to Facebook. The recording shows fire claiming houses and trees, and sparks blowing across the road in front of them. Suddenly the vehicle breaks through a wall of smoke and emerges into the safety of a clear road.\n\nJones, the mayor, said a good portion of the business district is gone. And while some trees were torched, Jones said most of them remain.\n\n\"One of the things that's beautiful about Paradise are the trees and they're still here. ... I wasn't expecting that, but it's a good thing,\" Jones said.\n\nAt least 52,000 residents were forced to evacuate from Butte County as the fire burned 90,000 acres.\n\nFlames also were on the outer edges of Chico, a city of 93,000 people about a 90-mile drive north of Sacramento.\n\nThe full extent of the destruction in the county was still unknown, but authorities said more than 6,700 buildings have been destroyed -- many of those in Paradise.\n\nWhitney Vaughan described a scene of panic and terror as she recalled her narrow escape from her Paradise home Thursday morning.\n\nVaughan and her husband had just fled their home as flames rushed them. She saw a man \"sprinting past our house carrying a little baby, running as fast as he could.\"\n\nThey drove away but got eventually got caught in traffic. Flames were feet away, smoke was thick, cars weren't moving and people were panicking. Some people left their cars there \"and took off running, carrying their babies and kids.\"\n\nShe cried as she recorded video of the terrifying scene, which she posted to Facebook. She and her husband eventually were able to drive away safely.\n\n\"We thought the fire was going to kill us,\" she told CNN.\n\nParadise, roughly 80 miles north of Sacramento, is where four people were found dead in different vehicles and one person was found dead near a vehicle on the road where Vaughn recorded her video. The other four deceased victims were also found in the Paradise area.\n\nFive people had to be rescued by helicopter from the fire according to Josh Bischof, Riverside Fire Battalion Chief. The rescues were performed by firefighters who were actively engaged in fire-fighting, Bischof said.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California Jacob Saylors, 11, walks through the burned remains of his home in Paradise, California, on Sunday, November 18.

The buildings were seen in movies and television series such as \"Westworld\" and \"The Cisco Kid.\"\n\nThree firefighters and some civilians were injured, Cal Fire officials said. The extent of their injuries was unknown.\n\nMore than 3,200 firefighters were battling the flames and the fire remained just 5% contained, according to Cal Fire. The cause of the fire is still under investigation\n\nThe Camp Fire has destroyed an unknown number of homes and buildings in Paradise.\n\nWoolsey Fire: Thousands of homes evacuated, Malibu area threatened\n\nIn Southern California, strong Santa Ana winds were fanning two fires, including the Woolsey Fire, which by Friday morning had burned across US 101 and was heading toward Malibu.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why wildfires are becoming the new normal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why wildfires are becoming the new normal 02:19\n\nThe Woolsey Fire exploded from 2,000 acres to 8,000 in Los Angeles and Ventura counties in a matter of hours. Friday evening, officials said it had grown to 35,000 acres.\n\nAt least 75,000 homes in Ventura and Los Angeles counties were under evacuation orders, and some structures have already been destroyed, officials said.\n\nThe fire crossed US 101 a few miles east of Thousand Oaks -- the site of Wednesday night's bar shooting -- and was headed south to the Pacific coast, in the direction of Malibu Creek State Park and Malibu city, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.\n\nVIDEO: @LACoFireAirOps Firehawk helicopter flying along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu on the way to protect life and property.

I can't think anything matters more -- packing 'items' seems strange. The smoke just seems surreal,\" she wrote.\n\nIn Hidden Hills, just north of Calabasas, Adrienne Janic gave her home over to firefighters late Thursday to use as a command center. Her deck provided a strong vantage point to monitor the spread of the fire.\n\nBy 1 a.m. (4 a.m. ET), more firefighters arrived as the flames closed in on Janic's street\n\n\"While a lot of my yard and neighbors' yards burned, the firefighters saved our homes,\" Janic tweeted just after 2 a.m. (5 a.m. ET) Friday. \"We are still not out of the woods yet.\"\n\nChristy Dawn Little abandoned her Oak Park home, northeast of Thousand Oaks, around 11 p.m. (2 a.m. ET).\n\n\"I had to work this evening, and ran out when I realized how close it was,\" Little told CNN. \"We have found a safe hotel ... (in) Los Angeles.\"\n\nVideo of her drive out of town shows the fire emitting an orange-red glow in the distance in the nighttime sky.\n\nHill Fire: RVs, outbuildings burned\n\nThe Hill Fire is the other fire burning near the site of this week's mass shooting in Thousand Oaks\n\nThe fire started Thursday afternoon and spread quickly to cover about 6,000 acres, fire officials said. Friday, part of it was burning into the footprint of a 2013 wildfire, which could slow its spread, Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said. The Hill Fire was 15% contained by Friday evening, at 4,531 acres.\n\nResidents on social media posted their views of the flames nearly consuming the hillside in the Newbury Park area of western Thousand Oaks.\n\nWhile no homes or businesses have been lost to the fast-moving blaze, a number of RVs and outbuildings have been burned and a firefighter suffered a minor injury, authorities said.\n\nHowling Santa Ana winds were driving the Woolsey and Hill fires. The Santa Anas are strong, dry winds that high-pressure systems push from east to west, from the mountains and desert areas down into the Los Angeles area.\n\nWind gusts of up to 77 mph were reported in Los Angeles County on Friday morning.\n\nA round of Santa Ana winds is forecast to whip the area Sunday through Tuesday, though it may be weaker than Friday's.",

street was known to authorities for his radical views but was not considered a threat, Australian police said.\n\nHassan Khalid Shire Ali, 30, had his passport canceled in 2015 when authorities found he had plans to travel to Syria. He was known to the Victorian Joint Counter Terrorism Team but was not being monitored, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Ian McCarney told reporters Saturday.\n\nISIS had claimed responsibility for the knife attack through its media wing Amaq, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. CNN cannot independently verify the claim and no evidence to support it was provided through Amaq.\n\nOn Saturday, McCarney said Shire Ali was only inspired by the group and did not appear to be direct links.\n\n\"The event yesterday for us is a reality check. Even with the fall of the caliphate in the conflict zone, the threat continues to be real,\" McCarney said.\n\nThe attacker's pick up truck burnt out as he lunged people with a knife.\n\n\"Obviously in terms of how and where, why and when he moved along that path from radicalization to basically putting in place those actions will be a key focus of the investigations and I dare say other investigations,\" McCarney added.\n\nFriday's attack, which is being treated as an of act of terrorism, began when the attacker's vehicle burst into flames and the man emerged and \"engaged\" with members of the public in a busy downtown street, Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton told reporters Friday.\n\nThe horrifying scene was over in a matter of minutes after police shot the attacker, who died after being rushed to the hospital under police guard.\n\nOnly after he was shot did police realize that three members of the public had been stabbed. One man died later in hospital. He was identified by local media Saturday as Sisto Malasspina, the co-owner of a popular Italian restaurant in Melbourne.\n\nTwo other men underwent surgery and were in stable condition in hospital, police said Saturday.\n\n\"This is an evil and terrifying thing that has happened,\" Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews said.\n\nThe attack\n\nLate Friday, witnesses reported hearing a loud explosion from the vehicle, which burst into flames before a man emerged and began attacking people with a knife in the street, police said.\n\nWhen police arrived, the man punched one of the officers through their patrol car window, Ashton told reporters. He lunged at them with a knife when they got out of the vehicle. One of the officers shot him in the chest, Ashton said.\n\nAfter putting out the fire in the car, authorities found what Ashton described as \"barbecue-style\" bottles of gasoline inside the vehicle, which prompted authorities to call the bomb response unit to the scene.\n\nThe investigation is still in its early stages, but Ashton said police do not believe there is a \"ongoing threat.\"\n\n#UPDATE: Hundreds of police are on-scene on Bourke Street in Melbourne's CBD after reports of a 'serious incident'. #9News https://t.co/3LxsLzLDIk pic.twitter.com/XgtUbF9cwh \u2014 Nine News Melbourne (@9NewsMelb) November 9, 2018\n\nSlain restaurant owner remembered\n\nSisto Malasspina, the man killed in Friday's attack, was a well-known restaurateur, Australia's national broadcaster ABC reported.\n\nThe 74-year-old man was remembered on social media by politicians, comedians and celebrities who described him as a great man.\n\nActor Russell Crowe said he knew Malasspina for more than three decades and considered him a friend.\n\nSisto, il mio cuore si spezza ...

Though the main race was Tuesday, there are events scheduled until Saturday.", "Paris (CNN) Sullen and combative after an electoral humbling, President Donald Trump landed Friday in Paris, hoping to use the global stage to restore some standing as he faces a tumultuous political future at home .\n\nThe President and first lady are visiting the French capital for a ceremony commemorating 100 years since the end of World War I, a weighty moment for the world to remember the conflict that did not wind up ending all wars.\n\nOfficials say the President will use the moment to underscore the essential role the United States played in restoring European peace and security -- and continues to play now, despite Trump's complaints that it costs too much. Like presidents before him, he will use the trip to escape an unpleasant election outcome that could salt the remaining two years of his term with investigations, subpoenas and gridlock.\n\nForeign policy remains an area Trump has a mostly free hand to do with as he pleases, without requiring signoff from a soon-to-be divided Congress. His predecessors also flew off on foreign trips after midterm drubbings, using the world spotlight as a reminder of their relevance and stature.\n\nTrump has been scrambling since Democrats won control of the House on Tuesday to distract from the results and paint forward momentum. The power shuffle in Washington swept out Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who was asked to resign on Wednesday. Battles with the media and an executive action on immigration followed.\n\nAs he departed Friday for what he termed a \"beautiful trip,\" Trump continued to vent about the Russia investigation and new criticism from former first lady Michelle Obama in a forthcoming memoir.\n\nAir Force One, though, is an ultimate refuge, able to place literal miles between the President and the bad news.\n\nThe President confirmed his attendance at the centenary event after determining in August that the $90 million price tag for the military parade he had commissioned in Washington was too steep. He said then that he would \"go to the Paris parade\" instead.\n\nTrump had originally ordered his own military parade after being wowed by a Bastille Day procession in Paris last year. The Armistice Day ceremony is expected to be far more solemn, without an overly military bent. It is, after all, intended to observe the end of war, not the practice of it.\n\nDuring his trip, Trump will visit two burial grounds near Paris set aside for some of the roughly 117,000 American military personnel who died in World War I. On Sunday -- Veterans Day in the United States -- he'll deliver remarks from Suresnes, the American cemetery perched on the side of Mont Val\u00e9rien with a view of the Paris skyline.\n\nEuropean embrace?\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump has 'terrible' phone call with Macron Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump has 'terrible' phone call with Macron 00:44\n\nThe only leader he will formally meet is his host, French President Emmanuel Macron, one of his closest global partners. US officials said the civil war in Syria and attempts to counter Iran would sit high on the agenda.\n\nEuropean leaders have been eyeing the President warily in his first two years in office, and Tuesday's election results were unlikely to ease many of their concerns. For Trump, a heavier focus on foreign policy could mean even more hostile confrontations over defense spending and trade, both reliable bugbears for the \"America First\" commander in chief. If the past days have provided an example, Trump's political chastening hasn't translated into a more moderate tack.\n\nIn the French capital, Trump will at least find himself in the company of leaders facing their own political doldrums. Macron, who enjoyed a honeymoon surge of popularity following his election last year, is now wallowing in unpopularity. Recent polls have pegged his approval rating in the 20% range. When he took off for a holiday with his wife in northern France recently, rumors percolated in the French press that he was recovering from exhaustion (he denied it).\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who for years has acted as Europe's de facto leader, is deflated. Never able to recover from her unpopular decision to allow entry to millions of migrants fleeing war in the Middle East, Merkel announced recently that she would not seek another term in office.\n\nAnd British Prime Minister Theresa May is still struggling to complete her country's exit from the European Union, a thankless task that has earned her both ridicule and rivals from her own party. Many observers don't give her long in office when, and if, the Brexit plan is complete.\n\nTrump and Putin\n\nJUST WATCHED New arms race brewing between US and Russia Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New arms race brewing between US and Russia 02:36\n\nOne leader in attendance not facing immediate political trouble: Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the President is likely to encounter during Sunday's centenary ceremonies.\n\nTrump and Putin had engaged in on-again, off-again plans for a more formal meeting in Paris, but French officials intervened, telling the US and Russia that talks between the two leaders would overshadow the solemn commemoration of the end of the war. Trump announced on Wednesday that there was simply no time to meet with Putin in France.\n\n\"I'm coming back very quickly,\" the President said. \"I don't think we have time set aside for that meeting.\"\n\nInstead, he said a meeting with Putin -- which will act as a follow-up to a maligned summit to two men held in Helsinki, Finland, over the summer -- would occur on the sidelines of the G20 summit at the end of the month in Buenos Aires (Trump will also use those talks for a dinner meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping).\n\nWhichever the venue, Trump will face close scrutiny after his last summit with Putin ended with him essentially accepting Putin's denial that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. With Democrats soon in control of the House, investigations into the Russia matter are all but guaranteed not to subside. And special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference is poised to scale up its public activity now that the midterm elections have concluded.\n\nOn Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said she hoped America's \"Russophobic fervor\" would end soon, but she speculated the new political climate would only escalate tensions between Washington and Moscow.\n\n\"There is unfortunately a sense that a new round of these allegations will start, but it seems to me Americans should begin to understand the absurdity of this,\" she said. \"Many already do. I mean American politicians.\"", "Washington (CNN) Leading figures in the Russia drama face fateful choices in the coming days and months that could tip America into a political and constitutional abyss. With the midterm elections in the rearview, a sense of foreboding is settling over Washington.\n\nThe gravity and consequences of the investigation suddenly seem oppressive, with special counsel Robert Mueller writing his final report and an unchained President Donald Trump aggressively seeking to check him.\n\nNew acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, must quickly adapt to new circumstances and powers that have made them vital players at a critical moment of the intrigue.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear, not least from Trump's raging mood, that the end game of the Russia saga will subject the mechanisms of the US government to extreme stress and test the nation's shattered cohesion.\n\nThe President: Disrupt or stand pat\n\nTrump pointed out in his post-election news conference on Wednesday that although he believes the Russia investigation is \"very bad for our country\" he has so far not shut it down.\n\n\"I could have ended it anytime I wanted. I didn't. And there was no collusion,\" he said.\n\nBut there is speculation that he could use Whitaker as a tool to interfere with Mueller's probe or stifle its conclusions, or even to try to fire the special counsel. Any of those options could ignite a constitutional conflagration.\n\nAlternatively, Trump could choose to wait for the final report into allegations his campaign colluded with Russia in 2016 and he obstructed justice to cover it up.\n\nThe President has already given an ominous glimpse of his intentions.\n\nWithin hours of midterm polls closing, Trump ejected Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump installed Whitaker above Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has been giving cover to Mueller and his investigators while overseeing the probe.\n\nSome critics interpreted Trump's move as his latest bid to undermine the investigation or remove officials he sees as a threat, in what legal commentators are now calling a \"slow motion 'Saturday Night Massacre,' \" in reference to Watergate.\n\nThere is a building debate over whether Trump's appointment of Whitaker might have been in itself an abuse of power.\n\nStill, there were signs on Thursday that there has been no disruption to oversight of the Mueller probe. Rosenstein's top deputy, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed O'Callaghan, met lawyers from the special counsel's team in a regular biweekly meeting, a source familiar with the matter told CNN's Laura Jarrett.\n\nThe source explained that while Whitaker has ultimate oversight authority as the acting attorney general, the day-to-day running of the probe is still being handled by Rosenstein's office. \"It's business as usual,\" the source said.\n\nThe President is on dangerous ground if he decides to pressure the investigation.\n\nIf it later comes out that Trump by design put Whitaker in position to thwart the investigation, he could provide more evidence that he is guilty of a corrupt purpose to obstruct justice.\n\n\"That will send him down a path that for the next few years that would tie up his presidency in ways that are not in his best interests legally or politically,\" said Michael Zeldin, a former senior Justice Department official, with a touch of understatement on CNN International on Thursday.\n\nThe new acting attorney general: Suddenly on the hot seat\n\nJUST WATCHED Whitaker likes to talk about Mueller Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Whitaker likes to talk about Mueller 02:08\n\nCNN revealed on Thursday that Whitaker has publicly shot down the idea that Russian interfered in the 2016 election -- contradicting multiple Mueller indictments.\n\nNow, he is suddenly thrust into the most high-stakes legal, political showdown involving different branches of government since Watergate.\n\nHe has the power to narrow the investigation and limit the budget for the special counsel's team. He could refuse requests by Mueller to request indictments or to subpoena testimony from the President.\n\nHe could try to stifle publication of Mueller's final report or could try to keep it from Congress.\n\nMichael Conway, counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate, said that the most sinister threat to Mueller may be a quiet attempt to suppress his work by Whitaker out of sight of Congress or the public.\n\n\"The concern would be that behind the scenes, he would in a whole variety of ways thwart the investigation without the issue of a public firing, without the issue of a cataclysmic event that would generate immediate political backlash,\" said Conway, now a professor at the Medill School of Journalism.\n\nDemocrats demanded Whitaker recuse himself over his previous criticism of Mueller -- a largely academic exercise since it's obvious his main attraction to Trump is that he is not prevented from overseeing the investigation.\n\nThe first sign that Whitaker is acting against Mueller could come if there are no indictments in the weeks to come or signs of activity at the grand jury.\n\nIf indictments follow, it could be a sign Whitaker stepped back.\n\nOne interpretation of Trump's swift rejigging of the Justice Department after the midterms is that the President did not want time for Mueller to produce any indictments after the end of a self-imposed hiatus during the political season.\n\nWhitaker has walked into tremendous personal pressure. Trump has made no secret of his visceral anger at Mueller, and has shown -- in his dealings with fired former FBI Director James Comey and Sessions -- that he expects loyalty to him to supersede everything.\n\nWhitaker will face the same demands and is in a far weaker position than either Sessions or Comey, who enjoyed personal power bases and reputations and alliances forged after decades of public service.\n\nOnce he is read into the Mueller investigation, the new attorney general will face an ethical question. Will he tell Trump what he knows even though doing so would cross an ethical line?\n\nBut Whitaker is also in a legally vulnerable position.\n\nHe risks being pulled into a conspiracy if the President or other officials seek to unlawfully obstruct the investigation. He is likely to be hauled up to Capitol Hill by the new Democratic House majority in the new year and be forced to testify under oath about his appointment. He might remember that Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell was convicted for his role in Watergate.\n\nAt some point, Whitaker may face the ultimate dilemma for a Washington law enforcement official caught in a scandal. Does his duty to the Constitution or his President take priority?\n\nMueller: Keep calm and carry on?\n\nMueller's silence has been his best defense against ferocious efforts by Trump and the conservative media machine to draw him into the political swamp.\n\nSo it is, and always will be, impossible to know what he thinks about the new Justice Department hierarchy.\n\nCNN reported Thursday that the special counsel had started writing his final report. Recent weeks grand jury activity indicates that Mueller is trying to find out whether Trump's longtime adviser, Roger Stone, knew in advance that Wikileaks would release hacked material during the 2016 campaign.\n\nBut there was also a reminder on Thursday that his freedom to act could be in doubt when Michael Dreeben, a prosecutor for the special counsel's office acknowledged in court that Whitaker could change or rescind the May 2017 order that appointed Mueller.\n\nPeople who have worked with Mueller believe he has already prepared for the suppression or shutting down of his work. He has for instance farmed out the tax fraud case against Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen to prosecutors in New York. There was speculation in Washington recently that sealed indictments against targets of the probe may already have been filed.\n\nMueller has some protection in his initial charge from Rosenstein.\n\nIf Whitaker takes steps to constrain Mueller, he would be required to explain to the leadership of the Senate and House Judiciary committees why he did so.\n\nIn theory, he can also only be fired for cause or misconduct.\n\nIn the last resort, his resignation would provoke a political firestorm that could lead to impeachment proceedings against the President. But it would also risk the possibility that much of his work does not see the light of day.\n\nPelosi: The institutional check on Trump\n\nPelosi is likely to be the next House speaker and will have the power to have an institutional check on the administration.\n\nShe will have authority over House committees that will provide oversight of Trump and the Justice Department. On Thursday, she held a conference call with new and existing members to discuss the Sessions firing and Whitaker's appointment, sources told CNN.\n\nDemocrats have already indicated that they will investigate Trump's appointment of Whitaker. They are likely to reinvigorate the House Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation when they get the gavel.\n\nPelosi will be pulled in multiple directions. She faces an imperative to respond to any attempts by Trump to curtail Mueller. But as preparations begin for the 2020 election, she must guard against actions that could be portrayed by the GOP as overreach.\n\nAt the same time, she will face pressure from her left from liberal activists who are already demanding Trump's impeachment.\n\n\"I don't think we should impeach a president for political reasons. But I don't think we should not impeach him because we think it's politically ... impeding for us to do so,\" Pelosi told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview Thursday.", "Tokyo (CNN) One of Japan's biggest television stations has canceled a performance of the massively popular K-pop group BTS amid allegations that one of the band members wore a shirt that appears to show the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.\n\nThe seven-member boy band was scheduled to appear on TV Asahi's flagship music program, Music Station, Friday night.

Estos blancos f\u00e1ciles e inocentes encarnan la vida simple y cotidiana. La gente va y viene. Entran y salen. Esperan estar a salvo mientras toman una taza de caf\u00e9, depositan sus cheques de pago, llenan las recetas o toman un bocado para comer.

El atacante hiri\u00f3 a otras cuatro personas.\n\n\u2022 Y este mi\u00e9rcoles, 12 personas murieron y m\u00e1s de una decena quedaron heridas cuando un hombre enmascarado abri\u00f3 fuego dentro de un bar en Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nNormalmente, estos lugares son seguros y \u2013se supone\u2013 accesibles. La facilidad que ofrecen para entrar y salir resulta clave para su \u00e9xito, en algunos casos. El problema es que muy a menudo las malas personas saben justamente esto.\n\nEl Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. abord\u00f3 recientemente este tipo de ataques en su blog, DipNote. \u201cLos ataques en espacios p\u00fablicos \u2013lugares donde los civiles trabajan, cenan, compran y toman vacaciones\u2013 son tr\u00e1gicos por las vidas inocentes que se pierden, as\u00ed como por el ataque violento contra la vida cotidiana de un pa\u00eds\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 una publicaci\u00f3n de septiembre\n\nAunque el texto del blog abord\u00f3 el tema del terrorismo (las autoridades a\u00fan no han calificado de terroristas ninguno de los \u00faltimos cuatro ataques), la estrategia para proteger un objetivo blanco e inocente es compleja, sin importar qui\u00e9n sea el atacante.\n\n\u201cLos restaurantes, estadios y lugares de entretenimiento est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados para ser sitios abiertos y accesibles, lo que los hace vulnerables\u201d, explic\u00f3 la publicaci\u00f3n. \u201cLos tipos de lugares que son atacados var\u00edan, al igual que la clase de ataques, incluyendo por lo general una combinaci\u00f3n de terroristas suicidas, hombres armados, rehenes o t\u00e1cticas de baja tecnolog\u00eda que convierten cuchillos o veh\u00edculos en armas asesinas\u201d.\n\nY Estados Unidos ha enfrentado la amenaza muchas veces: en un teatro en Aurora, California, en un concierto en Las Vegas, en el Marat\u00f3n de Boston.

En el caso de un tiroteo, la gente debe bloquear las puertas, apagar las luces, poner en silencio los tel\u00e9fonos y esconderse, preferiblemente detr\u00e1s de algo a prueba de balas.

Andreas Rentz/Getty Images\n\nDecades later, the few remaining remnants of the Berlin Wall and its footprint are of historical and even recreational interest. Here are a few of the many wall-oriented spots to see in Berlin:\n\nBrandenburg Gate: A good place to start your historical tour is the Brandenburg Gate, the history of which reaches back way beyond the communist era to Napoleon, who took the gate's crowning statue away during his military campaign through Europe in the early 1800s. (France returned it.)\n\nThe gate was the famous backdrop for US President Ronald Reagan's memorable challenge to the Soviets in the 1980s to \"tear down this wall.\" Once the symbol of oppression, it's now the city's symbol of free movement and newfound prosperity. And it makes a great spot for a selfie.\n\nEast Side Gallery: You can see more than 100 large-sized murals painted onto one of the few remaining pieces of the wall left standing.

Then there are the thousands of brass \"stumbling stones\" carefully set into the city's sidewalks, memorializing victims of the Holocaust. In Germany, it's called Erinnerungskultur, a \"culture of remembrance\" that takes an unflinching look into the darkest corners of the country's history.\n\nYet, when it comes to remembering World War I, there are far fewer memorials. At the Columbiadamm Cemetery in Berlin more than 7,000 World War I soldiers are buried. The rows of crosses are kept neat and tidy but are rarely visited, said Anne-Susann Schanner, an education officer at the Berlin branch of the German National Federation for the Care of War Graves.\n\n\"Sometimes I do see flowers on the war graves. People don't even have to go personally, they can ask us to put flowers on the grave. It happens when it's the death date or the birthday of the deceased,\" Schanner explained. \"There are no witnesses left and most people don't have that emotional connection to World War I.\"\n\nThis year marks a century since the end of the Great War. In France and the UK, the end of the war is marked every November 11 as Armistice Day, when Germany surrendered and signed a peace treaty with the Allied Powers, including Britain, France and the United States.\n\nPoppies are pinned on British lapels to remember fallen soldiers and the country pauses for two minutes of silence to mark the moment Germany surrendered. A National Service of Remembrance is held and a member of the royal family lays a wreath of poppies at the Cenotaph memorial in London.\n\nAn art installation of ceramic poppies surrounds the Tower of London to mark the centenary of the start of World War I in 2014.\n\nIn France, there are blue cornflowers instead of red poppies and a national holiday to remember those who died in the war. French President Emmanuel Macron is doing a week-long tour of World War I battlefields and holding commemorative events with British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, before convening a peace summit in Paris also attended by US President Donald Trump.\n\nIn Germany, however, the day is marked with muted self-reflection. This year, there will be memorial speeches in parliament accompanied by an art exhibition and a separate concert. But there is no nationwide event to mark the end of the war. For some critics, Germany has a selective memory when it comes to its culture of remembrance.\n\n\"Other European countries have already appointed commissions of World War I historians years ago, planned memorial events, built new museums. Only Germany did not do this,\" said Sevim Dagdelen, a member of parliament for the left-wing Die Linke party.\n\nShe points out that until last year the German government did not organize any independent memorial events, only accepting invitations for events outside the country. \"I still think that's scandalous, that the role Germany played in WWI, as the aggressor, as the cause of WWI, was consciously denied,\" she said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel at a memorial for fallen soldiers of World War I, in Putbus, Germany, 2017.\n\nLarger disaster to come\n\nSo what explains Germany's World War I memory lapse in its culture of remembering?\n\nIt's not just that Germany lost the war. What was the end of the war for France and Great Britain was also the beginning of a catastrophic disaster for Germany. The end of WWI changed the nation, ushering in the 1918 revolution that brought down the monarchy and installed the fractious, short-lived Weimar republic that led, ultimately, to the rise of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi regime.\n\nIn Germany, the trauma and atrocities of World War II completely overshadow the Great War and in schools, teachers often regard the events of 1914-18 simply as a prelude to the much larger disaster to come.\n\n\"The Second World War was so total from a German perspective -- and the experience of defeat was much more total than in 1918 -- that people have rightly and understandably obsessed about what led them to that disaster. And it's only in that context that they give much attention to the First World War,\" said professor Robert Gerwarth, director of the Centre for War Studies at University College Dublin.\n\n\"For a very long time the First World War was overshadowed by the Second World War, which is of course for Germany an even bigger war -- in terms of lives lost, the level of destruction within Germany and the trauma of the Holocaust. Up until 10 years ago, whenever historians or the general public discussed the First World War it was often seen as a kind of pre-history to the Second World War.\"\n\nFurthermore, precisely because of Germany's wartime history, the country still grapples with how to remember its war dead. At the Columbiadamm Cemetery, there is a monument to the war erected in 1925, a statue of a fallen soldier draped with a blanket, only his clenched fist visible, with his helmet and weapon laid upon him. Underneath are these words: \"We died so that Germany may live. Let us live through you!\"\n\n\"Propaganda used to claim that Germany will win the war,\" Schanner, the education officer, explained. \"They kept repeating how Germany won battles. And in the heads of the German people, that was the way it was. And then the war ended and they were shocked: 'We lost. And we have to give away parts of our country and pay reparations.' For many, it was a shameful peace.\"\n\n\"The population had to be assured: \"Yes, we lost the war, but the victims didn't die in vain.\"\n\nWorld War I graves at Columbiadamm Cemetery, Berlin\n\nCloser look at WWI\n\nBut those nationalist sentiments were warped by the fascism that swept the country under Hitler and the Nazi regime. During that time, there was a boom in memorial building, with many village churches installing a memorial to the war dead, says Schanner. \"Those memorials are very glorifying of war heroes and for us, from today's perspective, of course that's reprehensible,\" she says.\n\nThere's particular concern that the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), now that it has gained seats in the German parliament, is pushing for a nationalist revision of the country's history. AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland recently told party members that Hitler and Nazism \"were just a bird s**t in 1,000 years of successful Germany history.\"\n\nBut there is also some indication that Germany is taking a closer look at its World War I history. This year, it has increased the number of commemorative events. Chancellor Merkel will hold a joint memorial with President Macron at the Compi\u00e8gne Forest in France where the armistice was signed.\n\nMost symbolic, for the first time German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will attend Britain's National Service of Remembrance with Prince Charles to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. But for critics like Dagdelen, the government needs to do more.\n\n\"The German government has to be a role model for a peaceful foreign policy, which starts with a sentence by former Chancellor Willy Brandt: 'There must never be a war started from German soil again.' That is what we learned from German history and that has to be an obligation for us.\"", "United Arab Emirates (CNN) \u2014 The United Arab Emirate s is famous for its relentless sunshine, its golden dunes that roll on for miles and some of the most ambitious, opulent building projects of modern times.\n\nBut it's not all super-tall skyscrapers and shifting sands.

You don't need to worry when you're in the UAE.\n\nThe country is particularly safe for solo female travelers, especially with hotels such as Dubai's Jumeirah Emirates Towers hotel and Dukes Dubai dedicating female-only floors with an all-female staff.\n\nNo surprise that for the past two years Abu Dhabi outperformed cities such as Vienna and Tokyo to be voted as the world's safest by online crime index Numbeo.\n\nAnd we'd like to keep it that way, which is why you're going to have to pass through an extremely strict customs system to visit us.\n\nSay hello to the 944 inspection systems, including 23 drugs and explosives detectors and 700 radioactivity detectors, as you pass through Dubai International Airport.\n\nConnecting the world\n\nConnecting the world: Dubai's International Airport. Courtesy Dubai International Airport\n\nFor such a young country, the UAE has quickly climbed the ladder to become one of the world's most important and booming aviation hubs.\n\nThe UAE's strategic location between Oman and Saudi Arabia makes it ideal to connect travelers heading from the West to the East and vice versa.\n\nDubai's International Airport has been ranked as the busiest airport for international travelers for four consecutive years, with more than 88 million passengers passing through it last year. That's almost 10 times the number of residents (9.4 million).\n\nThey don't just pass through, though. Travelers get to enjoy facilities such as a five-star hotel, an outdoor swimming pool and a Zen garden -- all without leaving airport grounds.\n\nYes, other international aviation hubs are now building themselves up to compete with us, but we've also got plans to expand Dubai's airport to handle a whopping 220 million passengers by 2050.\n\nSo, if you're looking for the new Dubai, it's Dubai.\n\nShopping malls to rule them all\n\nOnly in Dubai: Shopping and skiing, in the desert.

Set for next Wednesday and Thursday, the meeting will include not only incumbent members of Congress but also incoming freshmen in town for orientation.\n\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, was signed by nine members -- two fewer than a similar letter that was sent earlier this fall.\n\nBecause the letter has enough signatures, it is set to be on the agenda for the next meeting.\n\nEleven Pelosi critics discussed the letter when they joined a 90-minute conference call on Wednesday night to plan their next steps.\n\nRep. Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, told CNN there are at least 12 rock-solid no votes for Pelosi on the House floor. According to a CNN count, 10 additional incoming freshmen have said they would not support Pelosi for speaker, a number that could threaten her chances of getting 218 votes on the floor.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind: If we get 229 (seats), she will never get 218\" votes to become speaker, Vela said.\n\nSo far CNN projects Democrats have a 225-seat majority, with 10 races still undecided.\n\nPelosi allies and aides dispute Vela's math and believe she will ultimately get the votes, especially since they see no viable alternative. In 2016, when Pelosi faced a challenge from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, 63 members backed her challenger in the caucus vote, but almost all of them supported her on the House floor, even Ryan, as she was the nominee.\n\n\"Leader Pelosi is confident in her support among members and members-elect. Democrats don't let Republicans choose their leaders. The election proved that the GOP attacks on Pelosi simply do not work,\" said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi.\n\nEleven Pelosi critics signed a similar letter in September pushing for a discussion on a more specific proposal. They suggested changing the caucus threshold to nominate a speaker from a simple majority to 218 votes -- essentially ensuring the nominee from this month's caucus election will get the requisite 218 votes when the full House votes in January.\n\nThe caucus, shortly before the October recess, had a spirited debate about the proposal, but with so many members wanting to keep the focus on the midterms, supporters agreed to withdraw the proposal at the time, though they signaled they would bring it up again after the election. They also wanted to get input from incoming freshmen.\n\nThe proposal is slightly different now. Rather than pushing for a 218 threshold, supporters simply want the idea of changing the rule to be brought up in general.\n\nAlong with Vela, signatories of the new letter were Reps. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, Kathleen Rice of New York, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Bill Foster of Illinois, Brian Higgins of New York, Kurt Schrader of Oregon, Marcia Fudge of Ohio, and Tim Ryan of Ohio.\n\nThe two members who signed the first letter but didn't sign the new one are Reps. Albio Sires of New Jersey and Robin Kelly of Illinois. Kelly told CNN last month she was planning to support Pelosi.\n\nThe change comes after multiple Democrats expressed interest in the idea of changing the caucus threshold after the last meeting, but some had reservations about a number as high as 218 -- a drastic change from the existing rule of only needing a simple majority of the caucus.\n\nPelosi has repeatedly expressed confidence in the past week that she would become speaker and formally launched her bid Wednesday night in a letter to colleagues. She argues she's the best person for the job because of her experience -- she became the first female speaker when Democrats last held the majority -- and negotiating skills.\n\nAsked if she's concerned about facing headwinds in her speaker bid, Pelosi told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday that it's part of the job.\n\n\"If I do, I mean, that's politics. This is not a day at the beach,\" she said. \"This is politics. And here I am; we've delivered the victory because we had the best possible candidates. And we had the best possible candidates who inspired the grassroots. We owned the ground.\"\n\n\"So, without getting into the -- making a sausage around here -- I feel very confident about where I am and I feel very encouraged by the overwhelming support in my caucus that we'll go to the floor,\" she added.", "Gov.

This is an extremely unusual step for an American government to take, and it has been met with widespread criticism and calls for the White House to restore Acosta's press pass. Here's the latest:\n\nIs Acosta still banned?\n\nYes. He found out his Secret Service \"hard pass,\" which speeds up entry and exit from the White House, was being suspended on Wednesday night. More than 24 hours later, he is still banned from the White House grounds.\n\nCNN is working behind the scenes on a resolution that would restore Acosta's pass.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nCNN says the revocation of his pass on Wednesday night \"was done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today's press conference.\"\n\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders explained it differently. She said Acosta's conduct at Wednesday's post-election press conference was \"absolutely unacceptable.\" She cited Acosta's refusal to immediately hand over a microphone to a White House intern while he was asking questions of the president. Sanders said the administration will \"never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\"\n\nBut video of the event shows that Acosta did not mistreat the intern. \"Pardon me, ma'am,\" he said, when she reached for the mic. After asking another question, he gave her the mic.\n\nCNN said in a statement that Sanders \"lied\" about what happened. \"She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened,\" the network said.\n\nWhat led up to this?\n\nAcosta has been a thorn in the side of the administration ever since Trump was inaugurated. He has been one of the most aggressive reporters on the Trump beat, winning him huge numbers of fans as well as critics. While some media critics say he's a showboat, he says his style is effective -- and necessary -- at this moment in time. Some Trump-supporting commentators called for his credentials to be revoked in the hours before the White House took action on Wednesday.\n\nWhat is Acosta saying?\n\nOn Thursday morning, he tweeted, \"Don't believe the lies coming from the WH. Believe in our freedoms. Thank you all for your support. We won't back down.\"\n\nSo what is Acosta doing now?\n\nHe's still reporting. On Thursday evening he reported that that Labor Secretary Alex Acosta (no relation) is under consideration for the open Attorney General job, citing two sources.\n\nAcosta is on the way to Paris to cover President Trump's trip to France, CNN said Thursday night.\n\nWhat are press advocates saying?\n\nMore than a half dozen prominent advocacy groups, from the Committee to Protect Journalists to the ACLU, have condemned the White House's action and demanded that his hard pass be reinstated. The White House News Photographers Association issued a statement expressing outrage that Sanders \"may have shared a manipulated video .\"\n\nWhat is a \"hard pass?\"\n\nIt is a security credential that reporters who regularly cover the White House use to expedite their entry and exit. Historically the passes have not been used to punish reporters.\n\nHas anything like this happened before?\n\nWhite House historians and professors were hard-pressed to think of any exact parallel to this case. CNN's statement called it \"unprecedented.\" The closest comparison might be the case of Stuart Loory , who was ejected from the Nixon White House after writing stories that challenged the then-president.\n\nWhat about CNN's other reporters?\n\nThe suspension only applies to Acosta. All of CNN's other reporters, producers and photojournalists continue to work from the White House grounds.\n\nAre any reporters boycotting the White House as a result?\n\nNot that we've seen, but journalists from across the media landscape have publicly lambasted the White House for its accusations against Acosta. One complicating factor: The lack of a daily press briefing. The Trump administration has phased out the daily on-camera briefings and opted to hold them on a sporadic, unpredictable basis. This removes one setting where in which reporters could show solidarity with Acosta.\n\nCould Acosta or CNN sue?\n\nSome experts say yes. \"Acosta and CNN have legal grounds to challenge the White House's decision,\" Jonathan Peters, a media law professor at the University of Georgia, told CNN. \"Relevant precedent says that a journalist has a First Amendment right of access to places closed to the public but open generally to the press. That includes press rooms and news conferences. In those places, if access is generally inclusive of the press, then access can't be denied arbitrarily or absent compelling reasons. And the reasons that the White House gave were wholly unconvincing and uncompelling.\"", "This article first appeared in a series on the legacies of World War I, published in August, 2014 for the 100-year anniversary of the war's outbreak.

Scientific progress now brought new fears as well as hope.\n\nThe other combatant nations responded to their maximum extent, with rapidly developed mixtures of retaliation-in-kind and protective technologies and procedures. Perhaps 1 million chemical casualties were inflicted, to little overall military advantage. Although fatalities were eventually kept relatively low, at about 90,000 in total, there was, and remains, deep revulsion at slow, agonizing deaths from tissue damage through blistering of the skin caused by innovations such as mustard gas or drowning through destruction of the lungs.\n\nMany survivors were left blind or permanently disabled. Human distress, dread, \"gas fright\" and their long-term psychiatric consequences are impossible to calculate. They may have fatefully helped intensify Hitler's psychopathology as he lay brooding upon the Armistice in a military hospital, temporarily blinded by British mustard gas.\n\nLater, in the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925, the world tried to address its WMD problem through a collective promise of \"no first chemical or bacteriological use,\" backed by uncontrolled arsenals, which it was hoped would deter treaty breach by the hideously plausible and familiar threat of retaliation.\n\nJUST WATCHED Three unexpected things from WWI Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Three unexpected things from WWI 01:24\n\nThat gamble held precariously in World War II but not in hidden, or conveniently overlooked, one-sided campaigns conducted by Spain, Italy, Japan and Egypt in remote theaters such as Morocco, Ethiopia, China and Yemen. Continued secret research created still more efficient nerve gases, blatantly employed by Saddam Hussein's forces in the 1980s against Iranians and Kurds, without international response. However, the international honeymoon period after the Cold War allowed the negotiation of total, monitored and inspected elimination of all chemical weapons stocks and production facilities under the 1998 Chemical Weapons Convention\n\nBut World War I and its aftermath have left discouraging precedents.\n\nAlthough banned, in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, from keeping any chemical weapons, Germany secretly maintained formidable capacities. Its specialists went on to set up joint trials and research facilities in the USSR and to pioneer the whole class of nerve agents. Cheating in arms-control treaties, especially with the assistance of third parties, has remained a lasting political anxiety and an intelligence priority ever since.\n\nWe now also know that during World War I, German agents tried systematically to infect Allied livestock with glanders (a serious bacterial disease, transmissible to humans but mainly affecting horses and mules). This was the insidious, but fortunately not then very successful, birth of covert scientific biological warfare -- which, despite the unverifiable and evidently broken Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1971, now persists as an uneliminable security nightmare.\n\nSo we are all still partially breathing the yellow-green poison cloud that Nobel laureate Fritz Haber determinedly developed and the generals of the German High Command, locked into the first scientific Total War, reluctantly authorized. (The suicides, apparently through shame and disgust, of both Haber's wife, Clara, and Hermann, one of his sons, seem to add further intimate casualties to his innovation.)\n\nHaber's weaponization of chlorine for the second Battle of Ypres heralded a period of destructive technological dynamism in which we still live, when, repeatedly, as Bertolt Brecht observed:\n\n\"Out of the libraries come the killers.\n\nMothers stand despondently waiting,\n\nHugging their children and searching the sky,\n\nLooking for the latest inventions of the professors.\"\n\nAnd today, the news remains bad.\n\nMothers still scan the sky for incoming chemicals.\n\nChlorine is back.\n\nAfter 1,400 people were killed with highly efficient sarin nerve agent in the rebel-held eastern suburbs of Damascus in August, the Syrian government agreed to join the 1998 Chemical Weapons Convention and cooperate in its own chemical disarmament, as an alternative to U.S. punitive strikes.\n\nPhotos: Photos: Women during World War I Photos: Photos: Women during World War I Women during World War I \u2013 Female army recruits from the United Kingdom are seen during drills in May 1917.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) World War I began more than a hundred years ago, in the summer of 1914, but for many of us it might as well be a thousand. We know it, if we know it at all, as a dimly remembered chapter in high school history, or as scenes from old black-and-white movies of soldiers hunkered in trenches doing battle with Germans in pointy helmets. It was all too real for more than 65 million men from some 30 nations who were plunged into carnage the likes of which the world had never before seen.\n\nEvery one of those soldiers is dead, and the causes they fought for are lost on many of us. Yet this \"war to end all wars\" is not a remote event. In fact, World War I changed the world forever, and its effects are all around us.\n\nTo begin with, it rewrote history at the grandest level: Empires fell, and new nations--Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Poland among them-- were born in the ashes. Leaders of the still-powerful French and British empires used the conflict to redraw borders in ways that set the stage for future conflicts that stretch on today, in the Middle East, for example.\n\nBut there is much more. The first mass conflict among industrialized nations, World War I upended the way war was fought. The weapons it introduced -- submarines, machine guns, poison gas, grenades, tanks -- are all still part of our arsenals. And it was World War I that made airpower and strategic bombing central to the success of any future war. Trench warfare traumatized both soldiers and landscapes, and informed art and literature for years. It would reappear as a battlefield strategy in both the Korean War and in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s.\n\nAt home and on the battlefield, World War I put new objects and words into circulation: \"cooties\" are something no kid wants to get, but for GIs in the trenches, they were real and they were lice; and sanitary napkins developed from the handy alternative use nurses found for cellulose bandage material produced for the war. The war popularized Kleenex and tea bags and zippers.\n\nIn fact, every time you admire an aircraft carrier, eat a meatless sausage, sit under a sun lamp, wear a Burberry trench coat, or set your clock ahead for daylight saving time, you are reaching back to commune with World War I.\n\nThe dawn of chemical weapons\n\nPhotos: World War I: A time of upheaval Photos: World War I: A time of upheaval French soldiers sing the national anthem at the beginning of World War I in August 1914. This \"war to end all wars\" might seem like ancient history, but it changed the world forever. It transformed the way war was fought, upended cultures and home life and stimulated innovations that affect us today.

Poison gas was first used on a mass scale by the Germans in April 1915 during the second battle of Ypres, and cloths strapped over the mouth and nose were at first the only protection.\n\nGas masks evolved quickly, though, and by the end of the war even some horses and dogs at the front had their own. The horrors of gas attacks resonate today in the reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, and, earlier, in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and the world still struggles to contain them.\n\nAll told, more than 9 million died in the conflict, and 21 million were wounded, psychologically scarring a generation. Soldiers were at pains to explain this new human experience of battle to those back home.\n\nThe English poet Siegfried Sassoon had this to say in 1917 about his time at the front: \"I'm back from hell/With loathsome thoughts to sell/Secrets of death to tell;/ And horrors from the abyss.\" Many others had no more words: these victims of \"war exhaustion,\" (the label of shell shock became more common) had trouble speaking: they are the forefathers of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder today.\n\nLikewise the scale and type of physical injuries challenged the ingenuity of prosthesis designers, whose work to replace lost body parts would enable countless soldiers to return to productive civilian life, a process echoed today as soldiers from recent wars recover from the toll of roadside bombs.\n\nWorld War I also set the stage for future conflicts, by breaking down barriers between military and civilian life. While soldiers fought at the battlefront, civilian women and men built their weapons, distributed food and propaganda, and kept the home front running. Women gained new visibility in society, moving into the jobs vacated by enlisted men.\n\nThey drove streetcars, smelted iron, built bombs and then, after a long day at the factory, scrounged for food for their families. Civilians working for the war effort meant that anyone could be a target: German Fokker planes attacked at the front, but Zeppelin airships bombed London and Paris. \"Total war\" made the home front a dangerous place.\n\nThis war left few things unchanged in its path, even in lands that saw no fighting. Although it was mainly fought in Europe, it awakened many to the scope and diversity of the planet. \"The entire world is participating in the war!\" a French almanac exclaimed in 1917, showing its readers a map of the world divided into enemy, ally, and neutral peoples. Whether as laborers or soldiers, Europeans went to other countries, and millions of Americans, Africans and Asians came to Europe.\n\n'Trapped in a net of woe'\n\nMore than two million United States soldiers fought in Europe, and the British and French empires brought over their colonial subjects. \"We perish in the desert; you wash yourself and lie in bed,\" wrote an Indian soldier to his wife in September 1915. \"We are trapped in a net of woe; while you go free. Our life is a living death.\"\n\nPhotos: Photos of WWI's \"Bionic Men\" Photos: Photos of WWI's \"Bionic Men\" WWI's \"Bionic Men\" \u2013 The scale and type of physical injuries endured by soldiers injured in World War One challenged the ingenuity of prosthesis designers, whose work to replace lost body parts would let many return to productive civilian life, a process echoed today with soldiers injured in our recent wars.

The assassination of Austrian-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, on June 28, 1914 by the Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip caused an international crisis that led in just over a month to multiple mobilizations.\n\nThe Archduke, traveling in an open car, was in Sarajevo to inspect imperial armed forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were among the former Ottoman territories annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908, angering Serbian nationalists such as Princip.\n\nAfter the assassination, Austria-Hungary gave Serbia an ultimatum, causing Russia to intervene to protect its Serbian client state, and Germany to help its Austrian ally. And so it all began: the military obligations imposed by the system of alliances drew one power after another into combat.\n\nAll parties thought the war would be a short one; none imagined the speed with which the conflict would degenerate into a series of local atrocities (the Belgians became the conflict's first group of refugees, as they fled German rape and plunder) and mass slaughter across many fronts.\n\nPhotos: Photos: Women during World War I Photos: Photos: Women during World War I Women during World War I \u2013 Female army recruits from the United Kingdom are seen during drills in May 1917.

Their effectiveness, as proved by the precedent of World War I, has given them a permanent place in many state arsenals, despite the paper trail of international agreements meant to ban their use. Democracies and dictatorships (France and Italy) both used them in the interwar period as agents of colonial conquest and rule, and Syria is the most recent example of their use.\n\nAs we approach this 100-year anniversary, each combatant country is remembering the war in its own way.

The first American cases developed there. Soldiers from army camps like Fort Riley, in eastern Kansas, carried the virus to other camps around the U.S., and over the sea to France.\n\nThe flu of 1918-1919 came toward the end of the First World War -- which began a century ago this year -- and it killed more people than died in that conflict, more people than the Black Death, back in the 14th century. In fact, nobody knows exactly how many people died around the world; the estimates go all the way up to 100 million, which would have been 5% of the world's population.\n\nIf you lost a son in uniform in 1918, you were equally likely to lose him to the flu as to enemy bullets; half of the American servicemen who died were killed by the flu.\n\nAfter the virus started spreading in Europe, infecting and killing people in a number of countries, it was thoroughly described in the Spanish press -- because the King of Spain got sick, and because Spain was not in the war, and therefore not censoring news, while the French, British, and German papers were suppressing anything which might have an effect on wartime morale or suggest vulnerability. And thus, as a prize of peace, Spain became forever connected to the most deadly pandemic of all time.\n\nInfluenza is a seasonal illness. Every year an influenza virus emerges, generally originating somewhere in Asia, and moves through the world, causing fever and chills, muscle pain and headache, cough and runny nose, and a certain number of deaths. That's why you need to get a flu shot every fall -- it's available now and you should make sure that you get it, and doubly sure that your children do -- because the flu virus is a particularly changeable microbe, and every year the virus is a slightly different genetic mix, and the vaccine has to be tailored to protect you.\n\nMost years, most strains, influenza is especially deadly to the very young and the very old. In my pediatric clinic, we vaccinate every child starting at 6 months of age, but we take special trouble to make sure that the kids with medical problems, from asthma to congenital heart disease, get flu vaccine every year.\n\nThe 1918 flu virus was different. It was deadly to young adults. The elderly, who are often the victims in flu season, did relatively well, perhaps because they had lived through a related strain of flu 30 years earlier, and therefore had some protective immunity. But people in their 20s and 30s, healthy young people, got sick in record numbers -- and many of them did not recover.\n\nThat same 1918 flu was unusually virulent, so a very high percentage of the people who got sick went on to die. They died because their lungs filled with fluid. They drowned, it was sometimes said, inside their own useless lungs. There are stories about how fast this influenza killed; people got sick and died within 12 hours.\n\nPhotos: Photos of WWI's \"Bionic Men\" Photos: Photos of WWI's \"Bionic Men\" WWI's \"Bionic Men\" \u2013 The scale and type of physical injuries endured by soldiers injured in World War One challenged the ingenuity of prosthesis designers, whose work to replace lost body parts would let many return to productive civilian life, a process echoed today with soldiers injured in our recent wars.

Some victims' feet turned black from internal bleeding.\n\nIn other words, the 1918 virus behaved a little like the Ebola virus, a hemorrhagic fever virus much in the news right now. This flu raced through classrooms and schools and theaters -- and cities. In Philadelphia in October 1918, every hospital bed was filled, and hundreds of people were dying every day. The city ran out of coffins.\n\n\"The most terrifying aspect of the epidemic was the piling up of bodies,\" John Barry writes in his book, \"The Great Influenza.\" \"Undertakers, themselves sick, were overwhelmed. They had no place to put bodies. Gravediggers either were sick or refused to bury influenza victims.\"\n\nAll kinds of public health measures and quarantines were tried, as the epidemic raged. Campaigns promoted face masks and targeted spitting in public with misdemeanor ordinances and fines. St. Louis closed its schools, theaters, pool halls, churches and bars, in a strategy called \"social distancing.\" New York City required businesses to stagger their hours, so that people wouldn't be squeezed together in rush hour commutes.\n\nWhen the Boston schools were closed, teachers were recruited as nurses. Some towns attempted to keep the virus out altogether; Barry tells the story of Gunnison, Colorado, which blocked all incoming roads and warned railway passengers that if they stepped off the train onto the platform, they would be arrested.\n\nJUST WATCHED Three unexpected things from WWI Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Three unexpected things from WWI 01:24\n\nCities also built their public health infrastructures; they opened emergency clinics, they strengthened reporting networks that tracked infectious diseases. In fact, the story of the 1918 influenza can be read -- by those who have eyes to see -- as the admittedly bloody beginning of the triumph of modern medicine, public health and scientific microbiology.\n\nBut none of that is what saved us, not the development of a vaccine. We were saved because, as it does every year, the flu epidemic receded. Maybe that intensely virulent strain of influenza virus was replaced, over time, by a less virulent strain. And the annual influenza story became a largely pro forma public health story: Viral strain identified, vaccine manufactured, full speed ahead! Get your flu shots!\n\nIn 1918, a virus that was unusually devastating to the young and healthy came into a world which, paradoxically, had marshaled many of its young healthy citizens for military purposes. So the First World War shaped the epidemic, and the epidemic, in turn, affected the war. Most famously, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson came down with influenza while attending the Paris Peace Conference and had to miss days of the negotiations that ultimately resulted in the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nEvery epidemic is a product of microbiology and sociology; we look at Ebola now and worry about an epidemic which can spread by mass air travel in an interconnected world, which circumvents some of our modern medical precautions.\n\nBut the important lessons from the 1918 epidemic are probably not specific to the virus -- or rather, they would argue for looking closely at any contagious illness and thinking carefully about true risk and true benefit. How is the virus actually transmitted, when does it make sense to practice social distancing, to institute quarantines, to close the schools and the pool halls and the churches?\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe have microbiological knowledge that the good people of 1918 did not possess; we have antiviral drugs and disposable personal protective equipment to be put on by everyone working with patients at risk. That should make us at once more fearful -- because yes, indeed, the world as we know it may end because of new and terrifying infectious agents -- and more sanguine -- because yes, we live in a world of microbes. They live on us, and in us, and sometimes we travel together into darkness.\n\nNothing will ever take away the threat of a new and virulent microbe. But we have learned a lot about building institutions to help us protect ourselves and the people we love, about public health and common sense.\n\nIn other words, stop worrying about Ebola, think about 1918, wash your hands and go get that flu shot.", "(CNN) Some 100 years ago, a woman in Pittsburgh or St. Denis in France or Petrograd, Russia, might have awakened at dawn, while her young children slept, to prepare for her first shift at a nearby munitions factory. Her husband, off fighting in World War I, had left her to test the limits of her own physical ability, as she provided food, shelter, warmth for her family, sometimes confronting great physical danger at work -- perhaps, for example, hanging suspended to load powerful explosives into the shells that other women had produced.\n\nWhen her work day was done, she went looking for food to buy, often standing in line for hours for scarce basic goods, scrounged for hard-to-come-by fuel to feed the furnace and cooked dinner. She washed the children, put them to bed, cleaned up and wrote a letter to her husband, keeping her worry off the page, before sleeping a few hours. And then she got up and did it again.\n\nA century ago, as nations and empires began mobilizing to send 65 million men to war, millions of women across the globe moved to fill in the holes created in civilian society. From Britain to Bosnia to Baghdad, across the United States and Europe and India and Africa, women would become single heads of household in unprecedented numbers.\n\nThey would serve directly on the battlefields as nurses and ambulance drivers and cooks. Yet they also had to keep their nations' home fronts running, moving into \"men's\" jobs, from smelting iron, to driving streetcars, to plowing fields -- as well as working to administer new public and private organizations in support of the war.\n\nThe war changed life for women, and it changed the women themselves. When men returned from war, they inevitably tried to reassert their dominance in family and society. But their own broken conditions and circumstances at home challenged these attempts.\n\nWomen once again had to navigate a tricky terrain laid by men. Yet women had displayed to the world and to themselves their competence in \"total war.\" Indeed, the war created a lasting legacy for women, marked by new political rights in many countries -- and marked also by widespread and enduring anxiety over rising feminine power.\n\nJUST WATCHED Three unexpected things from WWI Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Three unexpected things from WWI 01:24\n\nIn 1914, women were not new to the paid workforce. Individual industrial jobs were often considered as specifically for women or for men; entire industries, such as textiles, were \"women's industries,\" while men dominated in metal forges and machine factories. While wealthier women continued to shun paid work, by the turn of the century, lower-middle-class women had begun moving heavily into positions as clerks and secretaries, and women remained central to farming labor.\n\nBut with the declaration of war, economic shifts and official pressure pushed them increasingly into war production and into \"men's\" jobs (even as, in France, authorities contradicted themselves and confused women by urging them rather to stay at home and have more babies). If only 170,000 women in Britain worked in metal factories on the eve of war, by its end in 1918, there were nearly 600,000.\n\nIn the United States and Great Britain, women confronted wartime shortages of food and housing.\n\nAs they took on jobs outside the home, many relied on irregular child care or were forced to leave children without care. While, as in other combatant countries, American women generally strove to \"do their part\" for the war effort and accepted official assignments of war-related work, from factory work to food distribution, some balked at having to \"register\" with authorities.\n\n\"The war created a lasting legacy for women, marked by new political rights in many countries\u2014and marked also by widespread and enduring anxiety over rising feminine power.\"\n\nBritish propaganda posters declaring soldiers' dependence on female munitions workers gave women a sense that their labor contributions would be important and acknowledged.\n\nYet, even as women munitions workers faced heavy labor and harsh conditions -- along with danger such as in the Barnbow National Factory explosion of 1916 near Leeds, England, that killed 35 -- others condemned them for the relatively high wages they earned. It was a reflection of class tensions raised by the restructured wartime economy and women's role in it.\n\nBritish authorities offered small \"separation allowances,\" subsidies to soldiers' families based on the loss of income, and in turn assumed the right to check up on soldiers' wives, to make sure they were not drinking or sleeping with other men.\n\nA woman who followed her own factory shift with dancing or a quick drink at the pub confronted public accusations of being a \"flaunting flapper\" or an \"amateur girl\" -- effectively a prostitute -- even as fellow male workers and soldiers on leave might proposition and harass her.\n\nSome women felt new \"freedom\" during the war; others saw changing \"moral standards\" as the result of women who had seen their men \"swallowed up in that ever-increasing wave of death ...\"\n\nPhotos: World War I: A time of upheaval Photos: World War I: A time of upheaval French soldiers sing the national anthem at the beginning of World War I in August 1914.

Many women took on \"men's work\" to support the war effort and to ensure their families' survival but also found themselves subject to still more controlling government policies that came with \"total war.\" Women living in captured territories suffered added misery, billeting and serving often abusive foreign soldiers.\n\nIn Italy, urban women were effectively drafted into agricultural labor. Women farmers were, however, little mollified by this motley work force intended to substitute for missing men and draught animals. In European cities, women often stood in line for hours for a chance to purchase spoiled potatoes; together with barefoot children, they tried to scavenge food and fuel from public parks, a practice that had become a full-time job in itself\n\n\"A woman who followed her own factory shift with dancing or a quick drink at the pub confronted public accusations of being a \"flaunting flapper\" or an \"amateur girl\"\u2014effectively a prostitute--even as fellow male workers and soldiers on leave might proposition and harass her. \"\n\nIn Germany, a 1916 policy reserved scarce food supplies only for women who worked in munitions factories, as officials announced that \"the entire remaining civilian population, including women, were to be militarized through this plan.\" In the extraordinarily frigid winter of 1916-17, as schools shut down for lack of heat, the policy left few adults available to care for children.\n\nBy the end of hostilities, the war had transformed women's lives.\n\nIn many warring nations, acknowledging women's contributions became critical to warding off challenges to politicians' own power in the tumultuous postwar conditions, across Europe especially. Women won voting rights during hostilities or soon after in the United States, Canada and Great Britain; in the German Republic and the new Soviet republics; and in the new states of Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\n\nEconomic rights were a different matter.\n\nDemobilizing soldiers and groups claiming to represent them pressured officials and factory owners alike to \"make room\" in the workforce for returning men by laying off all women although women frequently remained the only potential earners in their households. This was one manifestation of powerful and contentious culture wars over the desirability and even possibility of returning to some halcyon past -- one that, like today, was in part imagined.\n\nBattles ensued across European and North American societies over how to otherwise recognize women's work during the war.\n\nShould newly impoverished women receive government assistance on the basis of their wartime contributions or only as dependents of wounded or fallen soldiers -- or perhaps not at all?\n\nIn Britain, authorities shunned the arguments of women's groups and deferred rather to claims of the need to put men back in their \"proper\" role of economic power, by retaining the wartime notion of benefits deriving only through the husband.\n\nIn Germany and Russia, conversely, women were now in principle to have equal status, though the practice did not always follow the principle. The divided attitudes about the value of female work that informed these debates lingers today.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

Yet men's physical and psychological injuries often precluded any return to their prewar existences, as did the social and economic upheaval of these years.\n\nWhat was \"normal\" had of course changed for the women left behind.

Rick Scott -- who is also the Republican candidate for US Senate in the state -- alleged without providing evidence that there could be rampant fraud in both counties and accused Democrats of trying to \"steal\" the election.\n\nScott's campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee filed two lawsuits on Thursday, one against the Broward County supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, and the other against the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, Susan Bucher. The lawsuits allege that the supervisors have not been transparent either about the collection of the vote or about the vote count, in violation of Florida law.\n\nSnipes told CNN she was not aware of Scott's announcement of a lawsuit and was not commenting.\n\nIn his news conference, Scott accused the election supervisors of \"mysteriously\" finding votes and called for a full \"law enforcement\" investigation, promising to take any legal action necessary.\n\n\"Tonight I am asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate this immediately, and I am considering every single legal option available,\" Scott said.\n\n\"We've all seen the incompetence and irregularities in vote tabulations in Broward and Palm Beach for years. Well, here we go again,\" Scott said. \"I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.\"\n\nThe campaign for Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, Scott's opponent, said the governor's actions appeared to be \"politically motivated.\"\n\n\"The goal here is to see that all the votes in Florida are counted and counted accurately,\" said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. \"Rick Scott's action appears to be politically motivated and born out of desperation.\"\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum tweeted in response to Scott that \"counting votes isn't partisan \u2014 it's democracy. Count every vote.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump later weighed in, tweeting, \"Law Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!\"\n\nScott delivered his blistering statement at the governor's mansion in Florida. His role as chief executive will surely raise conflict-of-interest concerns.\n\nHe did not take questions at the news conference.\n\nDiscrepancies in Broward County\n\nHis news conference comes amid questions over discrepancies in the vote tallies in Broward County.\n\nA CNN analysis of votes cast in Broward County suggests that ballot design could be responsible for a substantial difference in the number of votes cast between the race for governor and the race for senator in Florida, meaning thousands of voters there may have missed their chance to weigh in on the still-undecided Senate race. The placement of the Senate race on the ballot could have made it possible to overlook.\n\nBroward and Palm Beach counties became infamous for vote-counting problems during the 2000 presidential recount.\n\nFueling the controversy on Thursday, a teacher said she found a box marked \"provisional ballots\" in a storage area of the school long after the voting had taken place there Tuesday.\n\nLakeisha Sorey, a resource teacher at Sunshine Elementary School who has taught in Broward County schools for 16 years, said it looked like a plastic storage bin with a hole on the top with a printed label that said \"provisional ballots\" taped on the box. In a telephone interview with CNN on Thursday night, she said she took a picture but did not try to open or lift the box, because she did not want any questions.\n\n\"I did not touch it,\" she said. \"I knew that the elections were a federal thing, so I didn't want any of those issues. I didn't want there to be any interference.\"\n\nDozel Spencer, the Broward County Elections Voter Equipment Center director, told CNN that this was equipment, not ballots. He said it takes several days to pick up equipment after Election Day.\n\nBroward is a Democratic-leaning county. Among those who did vote in the Senate race there, 69.1% backed Nelson, while 30.9% backed Scott. Gubernatorial candidate Gillum topped Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis in the county by a similar share of the vote (68% for Gillum to 31.3% for DeSantis), but he earned about 10,000 more votes from the county.\n\nNelson trails Scott in the Senate race by about 15,000 votes statewide, and the race is likely heading for an automatic recount because the margin is so narrow.\n\nOverall, as of Thursday, nearly 25,000 voters in the county had cast ballots for governor but skipped voting in the Senate race, according to a CNN analysis of precinct-level results. Photos shared on Twitter of the ballot used in Broward show the races for Senate and the county's congressional districts in the lower left corner of the paper ballot, below lengthy instructions on how to vote. The candidates for governor were listed more prominently to the right of the instructions.\n\nIn neighboring Miami-Dade, where a sample ballot posted online suggests the Senate race appeared at the top, there were more votes cast for Senate than there were for governor. Across all 67 counties in the state, Broward's is the largest difference in votes cast between the two races, by more than 23,000 votes.\n\nAcross the 547 precincts in the county where both the Senate race and a congressional race were on the ballot, a comparison of the total votes cast in the governor's race and the Senate and congressional races shows a nearly identical dropoff for the two federal races in 127 of them, meaning that nearly all voters in those precincts who skipped the Senate race also skipped the congressional race.\n\nThat suggests those voters may not have seen the two races in the bottom left corner of the ballot. Across all precincts with both Senate and congressional races in the county, roughly 3% of people skipped voting in the Senate race even though they had voted for governor.\n\nIn the part of the state represented by Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson, who ran unopposed, it is likely that no House race appeared on the ballot, as Florida law does not require votes to be counted in unopposed contests. That would leave the Senate race on its own in the bottom left corner of the page.\n\nIn precincts that are part of that congressional district, the dropoff rate was even higher, with roughly 10% of people who voted in the governor's race not voting for Senate.\n\n'Broward County is the laughingstock'\n\nSorey, the teacher who found the box labeled \"provisional ballots,\" said Broward County needed to improve its handling of ballots.\n\n\"We need to get it together, especially in Broward County,\" Sorey said of the elections system.\n\nAfter finding the box at the elementary school, Sorey contacted her friend, Democratic state Rep. Shevrin Jones, who attended the Harvard Kennedy School's Senior Executives in State & Local Government program with Sorey's husband.\n\nJones called the Broward Elections Department. When he told the elections official about the box labeled provisional ballots, he said the official on the phone told him the box merely contained \"ballot paper.\"\n\nJones said he did not understand how the elections official would know what the contents of the box were, or why the box appeared to be locked, without having someone physically check it.\n\n\"I don't know how they would be able to determine that there was nothing in the box just from pictures they had seen or just from me having a conversation with them,\" Jones said in a telephone interview Thursday night.\n\nJones said that no one from the Broward County election called him back to tell him whether the box had been checked or picked up.\n\n\"It could still be in the storage area,\" Jones said. \"It's so baffling. It's so bad.\"\n\n\"There has to be a better way in how we are administrating when it comes to the election process, especially now,\" Jones said. \"We are 48 hours after the election and we are in a total cluster mess-up. It's unfortunate that we are in this situation again -- Broward County is the laughingstock of the country.\"\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correctly reflect that the two highest-profile races in the state appear to be headed toward a recount, not a runoff as originally stated.", "Dr. John Lee is senior fellow at the Hudson Institute (Washington) and United States Studies Centre (Sydney), and an adjunct professor at the University of Sydney. From 2016 until April 2018 he was senior national security adviser to the Australian foreign minister and also served as the lead adviser on the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper. The opinions expressed here are his own.\n\n(CNN) On the day Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne met Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing to signal the beginning of a thaw in the Australia-China bilateral relationship, her boss, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, announced a $2.2 billion infrastructure package as part of the government's \"step-up to the Pacific.\"\n\nFew Australian politicians want to admit that the \"step-up\" is targeted against another country. But it is occurring as Australians are becoming increasingly concerned with the significant Chinese increase of its diplomatic, economic and potentially military presence in the South Pacific, an area that has long been considered by Canberra to be its \"backyard.\"\n\nThe motivation for this massive investment is the worst kept secret in Australian foreign policy: Australians know it is about China; the South Pacific Islands know it is about China; even Beijing knows it is about China.\n\nIs Australia over-reacting? If not, why now? And can an economy less than one-eighth the size of China's really compete with the latter's ambitions in the South Pacific?\n\nFor foreigners, the national importance Australia attaches to the Pacific might be difficult to understand. In April 2018, Australian media reports claimed China had approached Vanuatu about building up its military presence on the island, and potentially opening a military base. Having given the island of around 270,000 people hundreds of millions of dollars of development aid, the reports also indicated that Beijing had been negotiating with Vanuatu about host and even basing rights for People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy ships.\n\nNo subsequent proof of these supposed negotiations was released. It was later denied by Vanuatu and rubbished by China. Even so, the reports generated at least as much popular interest and concern as China's well-known island-building program in the South China Sea and militarization of these artificial islands.\n\nIn Australian strategic circles, the notion of a supposed naval base around 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) from its shoreline did more than raise eyebrows. It played into the country's sense of vulnerability.\n\nAs reaffirmed in the 2016 Defense White Paper , the highest priority has been given to ensuring that no potentially hostile power is able to approach the Australian continent from Southeast Asia or the South Pacific in its national defense strategy.\n\nMoreover, it has long been unofficial policy between allies that the United States and Japan secure Northeast Asia, the US with Australian support secures Southeast Asia, and Australia takes the primary responsibility for securing the South Pacific. Perhaps a naval base hosting PLA vessels in Vanuatu was never in the cards.\n\nBut the PLA is seeking to enhance its reach and any permanent Chinese military presence in the South Pacific would allow the its Navy to \"break out\" into the Western Pacific Ocean. That scenario -- or any other base offered to it by a poor and desperate Pacific Island -- would fundamentally undermine Australian strategic policy which has been in place since the end of World War II.\n\nThis brings us back to Morrison's multi-billion infrastructure package, which includes funding an infrastructure bank for projects in the region. In the previous decade, Chinese funding of Pacific Island countries was part of its strategy of using \"checkbook diplomacy\" to persuade small island countries to recognize the People's Republic of China rather than Taiwan as the true \"China.\"\n\nAt least according to the Australian view, Chinese checkbook diplomacy is now about more than seeking official recognition at Taiwan's expense. It is also about winning over these small countries to China's way of thinking, whether it be about basing rights, controlling critical infrastructure in those countries or forcing states to turn a blind eye to controversial Chinese policies such as in the South China Sea\n\nBeijing achieves this through showering small economies -- which would otherwise find it difficult to attract foreign investment -- with cheap loans. As has occurred in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos and Pakistan, the tendency of these small and developing economies to accept far more debt that they can repay allows Beijing to dictate the political and/or strategic terms of any debt-forgiveness or restructuring assistance.\n\nPersistent suspicion that China is seeking to use Hanabata and Gwadar Ports in debt-ridden Sri Lanka and Pakistan respectively for military purposes in the future only raises the discomfort levels for Australia when it comes to China in the South Pacific.\n\nCertainly, China does not take half-measures. Since 2011, it has offered at least $1.3 billion in donations and concessionary loans to Pacific Island countries. This surpasses the $1.2 billion New Zealand has given over the same period. China's amount is second only to the $6.6 billion from Australia.\n\nTo be sure, Australia remains the preeminent aid and development contributor to the South Pacific and its decades of working with these small island economies means Canberra is well-positioned to remain the \"partner of choice.\"\n\nEven so, Australia has been largely reactive and playing defense to China offense. For example, Canberra signed an agreement with the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea in July to pay for undersea cables between the three countries in a last-minute bid to prevent Chinese firm Huawei from receiving the contract. In September, Canberra joined with the US in a last ditch attempt to thwart Huawei winning approval to build the domestic Internet cable network in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThese, and other, efforts have been reactive to Chinese overtures.\n\nThe point is not to outbid China in terms of short-term generosity or allow Pacific Island nations to play Australia off against China to maximize both countries' largesse. Morrison intends to ensure that these small economies will choose an Australian backed funding source which abides by World Bank and other international commercial standards but where access is fast-tracked and not held up by unnecessary regulations (typical of World Bank and Asian Development Bank Loans), and which impose repayment terms that are sustainable and will not endanger the solvency of these economies.\n\nAustralia knows it cannot keep China out of the South Pacific. But it can warn these developing economies about the price of severe indebtedness to China and offer them a ready alternative when it comes to the funding of critical infrastructure which would have domestic and/or regional security implications.\n\nMost of all, recent Australian policy is belated recognition it needs to compete in a region which has remain benign and free from potentially hostile external influence for over seven decades.", "Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion and a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who writes about authoritarianism and propaganda.

But rather than assigning them at random, each guest is encouraged to choose a room that best matches their emotions.\n\nThe four options are red (passion), green (rejuvenation), yellow (happiness) and blue (tranquility).\n\nAnd the color plays a bigger role than just determining the paint on the walls.

On Twitter, by comparison, Gavin has a mere 450,000 followers.\n\nWhy is a young American, born in Minnesota and still in elementary school, an instant sensation in the largest country in the world? It's because of Gavin's unique facial expressions, which have become a hugely successful, viral meme.\n\nGavin first made a name for himself in the US, when short videos of him playing with his uncle Nick Mastodon quickly became a hit online.\n\nBut it wasn't until Gavin's videos spread organically to the Chinese cyberspace, particularly one of him reacting with a nervous smile to a gecko being placed on his head, that his fame truly took off.\n\nA gif of Gavin's face, smiling awkwardly, might be used as many as 10 million times a day across China's various social media platforms, according to Ann Ding, founder and CEO of Dongtu.com, a major distributor of online gifs, told CNN.\n\n\"Gavin seems to be more popular in China than in the US,\" Ding said. She'd know -- her company partners with major Chinese social media platforms affiliated with Tencent and Alibaba.\n\nShe estimated that all of the total number of Gavin related gifs used across platforms in China has easily exceeded 1 billion.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) A fundamental question for President Donald Trump, as he moves forward after the midterms, is this: what role does he want to play? If he seeks to be the great negotiator he has always claimed to be, there could be an opportunity for him to cut the deal on immigration and on guns that other Republicans would not be allowed to by their base, and also a deal on infrastructure or tariffs. Will he do this? Or does the President double down on the rhetoric we have seen over the past two years?\n\nThese opportunities for movement exist. But the President's combative post-election press conference Tuesday -- and the dismissal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- appear to answer the question. There will be no pivot. Indeed, that this fighting posture was Trump's reaction to an election he claimed was a rousing success shows that the next two years are more likely to be a continuation of confrontation than any kind of cooperation.\n\nAnd despite presumed Speaker-to-be Pelosi's words in her own post-election turn before reporters, it's clear her conference wants a more confrontational approach.\n\nWhen Republicans won the 2010 elections, picking up 63 House seats, the red wave, or \"Tea Party election,\" was undeniable. Similarly, Tuesday night's results, without question, present new and existential problems for President Trump -- namely, a Democratic House hell-bent on investigating every aspect of his administration, and with subpoena power to do so. This will take a great deal of the administration's time and will mean that they are not as focused on their priorities as they otherwise would be -- regardless of what Democrats find or how much they potentially overreach.\n\nAnd while many are arguing over whether or not the election results constitute a \"blue wave\" -- which in my opinion is as silly as debating whether or not a newly elected President has a \"mandate;\" when you've won, you've won -- what's clear is that we are seeing a continuance of the realignment based on how rural or suburban a community is. So many red places got redder and blue places bluer.

Es decir, con la C\u00e1mara de Representantes en manos de la oposici\u00f3n pol\u00edtica al presidente volveremos a tener un contrapeso institucional y constitucional a ese mismo presidente.\n\nLa importancia de este contrapeso ha sido muy obvia por su ausencia en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os, durante los cuales el Congreso dominado por los republicanos le ha dado la espalda, repetidamente, a la responsabilidad de proteger normas b\u00e1sicas de nuestra democracia.\n\nLa segunda raz\u00f3n por la cual la democracia gan\u00f3 es porque los resultados reflejan la voluntad de la mayor\u00eda de los votantes, al menos en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes. Es decir, que el mismo partido que obtuvo el mayor n\u00famero de votos, tambi\u00e9n gan\u00f3 el control de una parte del Estado federal.\n\nEse no siempre es el caso. En las elecciones de 2016, tanto el presidente como la mayor\u00eda republicana en la C\u00e1mara ganaron sin tener la mayor\u00eda del voto popular en todo el pa\u00eds. El presidente, por las proclividades antimayoritarios del Colegio Electoral. La C\u00e1mara, por la concentraci\u00f3n de votantes en ciertos distritos, como resultado, entre otras cosas, del \u201cgerrymandering.\u201d (que significa la manipulaci\u00f3n del mapa electoral para favorecer a un partido).\n\nTambi\u00e9n fue ese el caso en el Senado este martes, en 2014 y en las elecciones presidenciales de 2000. En todos esos casos, m\u00e1s votantes prefirieron candidatos dem\u00f3cratas y a\u00fan as\u00ed, los republicanos se quedaron con el control.\n\nEsa din\u00e1mica nos ha dejado a la puerta de una silenciosa, pero verdadera, crisis de legitimidad del sistema democr\u00e1tico.\n\nAhora, con una C\u00e1mara de Representantes que refleja la mayor\u00eda\u2014o al menos la mayor\u00eda de los que participaron en las elecciones\u2014hemos dejado de lado, quiz\u00e1s solo por el momento, esa crisis y esa es una buena noticia para la salud de la democracia estadounidense.\n\nLa tercera raz\u00f3n, y quiz\u00e1s la m\u00e1s importante, por la cual la democracia gan\u00f3 es que los resultados, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del Congreso federal, dan una serie de pasos importantes para restablecer la confianza en el sistema democr\u00e1tico por hacerlo m\u00e1s abierto.\n\nEn un momento en que el pa\u00eds est\u00e1 viviendo profundos cambios demogr\u00e1ficos que no se hab\u00edan reflejado en nuestra clase gobernante, las elecciones abrieron paso a la diversificaci\u00f3n de los pol\u00edticos.\n\nPor primera vez en nuestra historia, por ejemplo, se eligieron al menos 100 mujeres a la C\u00e1mara de Representantes. La C\u00e1mara tendr\u00e1 dos legisladoras musulmanas por primera vez y tambi\u00e9n a las primeras dos mujeres ind\u00edgenas americanas como representantes en nuestra historia. En Colorado, por primera vez alguien abiertamente homosexual fue elegido gobernador.\n\nTambi\u00e9n accedieron a las urnas en varios estados varios segmentos de la poblaci\u00f3n que hab\u00edan sido sistem\u00e1ticamente excluidos.

Beto O'Rourke's closer-than-expected loss Tuesday has fueled optimism among his friends and allies -- as well as Democratic admirers across the country -- that he will run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nO'Rourke smashed online fundraising records on the way to coming within 3 percentage points of unseating Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. He ended the campaign with the tools, including a massive email list and a national progressive following, to remain a force in Democratic politics. But he hasn't signaled, even privately, what his next move will be.\n\nO'Rourke huddled with senior campaign aides Wednesday in El Paso, but offered them no indication of future political plans -- saying he first planned to spend time at home with his family after nearly two years on the road and process the election's results before weighing what comes next, one person present for the conversations said.\n\nAnother source described having \"very initial discussions\" with O'Rourke in recent weeks about the prospect of a 2020 bid and what it would take to scale a Senate campaign that operated largely on the candidate's own gut, without pollsters or a massive team of consultants, up to the national level. But the source said it's too early for O'Rourke to have made any decisions.\n\nPublicly, O'Rourke has flatly ruled out the possibility of a presidential run.\n\n\"The answer is no,\" O'Rourke said at a CNN town hall in October when asked about the prospect of a presidential campaign.\n\n\"Our children are 11, they're 10, and they're 7 years old. We've told them we're going to take these almost two years out of our life to run this race, and then we're devoted and committed to being a family again,\" he said.\n\nPressed again, he said, \"It's a definitive no.\"\n\nHe told MSNBC on Monday, \"I will not be a candidate for president in 2020. That's I think as definitive as those sentences get.\"\n\nDespite O'Rourke's comments, staffers on his Senate campaign have discussed a potential 2020 presidential run, with many of them hopeful he will ultimately enter the race, multiple people involved in those conversations said.\n\nThere is a belief within O'Rourke's camp and among his allies that the campaign's innovative approaches to digital and organizing -- which led to vast increases in young and Latino voters in Tuesday's midterm election -- set O'Rourke apart from other 2018 candidates. More importantly, they see O'Rourke as uniquely able to deliver a progressive message with a tone that is optimistic and not overly partisan.\n\n\"I don't know what he'll decide to do next, but I do think he's well positioned to be a major leader in 2020 and someone that can mobilize people from around the nation with his very independent and unique and progressive approach to politics,\" said Crist\u00f3bal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Fund and a Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign veteran who like O'Rourke is an El Paso native. \"What Beto has shown is that he can champion the values of the community without vilifying the other side.\"\n\nThe most significant obstacle for an O'Rourke 2020 bid could be timing.\n\nO'Rourke just ended a campaign in which a defining feature was his grueling travel schedule, visiting all 254 Texas counties. In livestreams on Facebook in the race's closing days, he was blunt about looking forward to time with his wife and three young children once the race had ended.\n\nMeanwhile, other big-name 2020 presidential candidates are already at the starter's gate. At least five potential candidates -- Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and billionaire activist Tom Steyer -- are in talks with prospective staffers and consultants this week, said several Democratic sources interviewing for those roles themselves or with friends who are doing so.\n\nO'Rourke's campaign team was largely made of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign veterans who are certain to have options to join presidential campaigns and are now trying to determine their own futures.\n\nOther 2020 prospects are anxiously waiting to see what O'Rourke would do. If he were to run, he would be a threat to another potential Texas candidate, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, as well as progressive grassroots favorites like Warren and Sanders.\n\nDemocratic activists and strategists have lauded O'Rourke for running one of 2018's most compelling campaigns. He raised $70 million after pledging to take no money from political action committees -- which meant turning Democratic-friendly groups like unions away, a step further than other Democrats who have only rejected corporate PAC money. And moments like his defense of NFL players who kneeled for the National Anthem could play better with Democratic primary voters than they did with swing voters in Texas.\n\nProgressives also saw him as cool, in part because everything O'Rourke did -- from livestreaming a cross-country drive with Republican Rep. Will Hurd before launching his campaign, to skateboarding across a stage in Corpus Christi in October -- happened on camera, often broadcast on his own Facebook page. The competitive Senate race also helped Democrats notch major wins elsewhere on the ballot, including picking up Dallas- and Houston-area congressional seats.\n\nCruz chief strategist Jeff Roe said Democrats \"don't have anyone of his caliber on the national stage. I pray for the soul of anyone who has to run against him in Iowa.\"\n\n\"He used a fog machine at his concession speech,\" Roe said. \"He ain't done.\"\n\nDemocrats in early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire say they haven't yet received any signals from O'Rourke's camp that he's even considering a presidential run.\n\nBut they're watching closely and waiting.\n\n\"Everybody here was watching that race with great interest,\" said veteran Iowa Democratic strategist Jeff Link. \"He was just impressive. He ran a different kind of campaign. He was young, he had a message of hope and opportunity. It was a well-run operation.\"\n\nLink said he had been skeptical that O'Rourke could quickly turn from losing a statewide race to running for president. Then, he said, he watched O'Rourke come surprisingly close to unseating Cruz, who won the 2016 Republican caucuses in Iowa, and changed his mind.\n\n\"Then the second thing -- and this is maybe even more impressive to me -- is just the level of turnout in Texas was amazing,\" he said. \"I think we need somebody who can increase turnout, particularly among younger voters, as we look to 2020.\"", "(CNN) \u2014 Travelers hoping to experience one of the oldest luxury hotels in Bangkok will want to book their flights ASAP.\n\nThe Dusit Thani Bangkok, a city icon famed for its striking modernist architecture, is closing its doors in early 2019.\n\nIt will be torn down to make way for a mixed-use project that will include a rebuilt version of the hotel.\n\nThough the new Dusit Thani will undoubtedly be spectacular, nostalgic locals are sad to see the original go. They're using these final months as a chance for one last visit.\n\n\"So many Thais, as well as expats, have told me how many memories they have of the hotel,\" says Titiya Chooto, Dusit VP of operations and general manager of Dusit Thani.\n\n\"As part of the transition into the new chapter we're now showcasing what we've been legendary for.

Basic guestrooms offer more subtle Thai influences, while decor in the higher end options, like the Ratanakosin Suite, are inspired by Thailand's historical eras.\n\nEven if you're not staying at the hotel, it's worth dropping by for a drink or a meal. (And be sure to visit the hotel's funky octagonal pool, which wouldn't look out of place in a campy 1970s film.)\n\nThe hotel offers six dining options, including Benjarong (contemporary Thai), The Mayflower (Cantonese) and Vietnamese eatery Thien Duong.\n\nIn need of a red meat fix?

There's free flow wine and a massive selection of sushi and other seafood on ice, as well as grilled fish and Canadian lobster, Alaskan king crab, river prawns, New Zealand mussels, Scottish scallops and plenty of imported oysters.\n\nDiners can order as many main dishes as they like off a menu that includes dim sum, NZ lamb, lobster thermidor and grilled US rib-eye steak then finish off the day at the cheese cart or the dessert buffet.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nThe Dusit Thani was originally due to close earlier this year but planning on the new project was delayed. This is great news for those wanting more time to enjoy the original before it closes for good on January 5, 2019.\n\nIn the lead-up to the closure, a number of events and promotions are happening, such as charitable concerts and fashion shows, concluding with a large New Year's Eve gala.\n\nRelated content Northern Thailand food: 9 dishes every visitor needs to try\n\nThe new Dusit Thani is due to open in 2022 and will be part of a 36.7 billion baht (US$1.1 billion) project made up of commercial and retail space as well as residences, built in partnership with Thai developer Central Pattana PLC.\n\n\"I'm so excited about the return of this property in a few years' time,\" says Titiya.\n\n\"While incorporating the latest technology, we will ensure the essence of Dusit Thani Bangkok is kept.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) The midterm elections brought fresh evidence that rapid changes in the American political landscape hold both peril and promise for the country.\n\nDavid Gergen\n\nAs the votes showed, the divisions among us are deepening at an alarming rate. Exit polls revealed voting blocs split across age, gender, race, education and income, just to name a few. On CNN, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin also warned that we haven't been this poisonously divided since the 1850s \u2014 and look where that led.\n\nTo add to the uncertainty, Trump announced he was firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions just hours after the midterm elections, leaving the future of the Mueller investigation hanging in the balance.\n\nFor the country's sake, the best thing that could happen in Washington now is for each side to call a yearlong truce in order to pass health care, immigration, and infrastructure legislation. The chances of that happening? Almost zero. President Trump's raucous press conference a day after the elections shows it is unlikely the President will take on a \"softer tone\" any time soon. His hatred of the ongoing Russia probes -- and threats to retaliate against Democrats if they exercise their subpoena power in the House -- could very well trigger dangerous upheavals.\n\nIf it were not clear already, Trump proved he will be a tough candidate in the upcoming presidential elections who won't be afraid to savage his opponents, abuse the powers of his office, and lie his way to victory. Trump rallied his fan base in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections, and appears perfectly capable of doing it again in 2020.", "The day before, Republicans lost majority control in the House, after a crushing midterm election. The Democratic takeover positioned one of Bush's most vocal critics, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, to take the helm as speaker of the House of Representatives, the first woman to hold that powerful office.\n\n\"With all due respect, Nancy Pelosi has called you incompetent, a liar, the emperor with no clothes and, as recently as yesterday, dangerous. How will you work with someone who has such little respect for your leadership and who is third in line to the presidency?\" I asked.\n\nIn his response, the confident President from Texas was humble and offered on olive branch to the incoming speaker.\n\n\"I've been around politics a long time,\" he said. \"I understand when campaigns end, and I know when governing begins. And I'm going to work with people of both parties. You know, look, people say unfortunate things at times, but if you hold grudges in this line of work, you're never going to get anything done.\"\n\nIt was a prescient message and a warning of what could come.\n\nAfter Democrats regained control of the House this week , Pelosi is poised to possibly make history again, this time not as the first female speaker of the House, but as the first person to return to that coveted position since the legendary Sam Rayburn in 1955.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: I won't share my taxes during an audit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: I won't share my taxes during an audit 02:00\n\nPresident Donald Trump, during his own East Room news conference a day after the midterm elections, began by offering what appeared to be an olive branch of his own, praising Pelosi for the Democrats' dramatic capture of the House saying, \"I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done, and what she's accomplished.\"\n\nBut moments later, Trump changed his tone as he pledged revenge for any Democratic-led House investigations he deemed unfair, threatening to block legislation and effectively shut down the government, a far different tact than Bush's soul-searching.\n\nAs for Pelosi's part, at her own news conference at the US Capitol, she pledged not to allow any \"scattershot freelancing\" from those in her caucus investigating the administration. She emphasized \"standing her ground\" while \"seeking common ground\" with the President and said she had already talked with Trump about possibly working together on an infrastructure package.\n\nPresident George W.

She touted a tax cut and PEPFAR -- an AIDS relief program in Africa -- as proof she \"worked very productively\" with Bush when Democrats had the majority.\n\nIn 2006, Bush acknowledged the midterms were in large part a referendum on the controversial war in Iraq. And he seemed aware of the results' impact, candidly telling me, in what would later become a famous punch line, \"it was a thumpin',\" Bush said.\n\nA clear contrast to Trump who said Wednesday's results were nearly a \"very close to complete victory,\" even though the GOP lost the House after holding it for several terms.\n\n\"There comes responsibility with victory\" Bush quoted Pelosi in 2006. \"That's what she said ... she wants to work together, and so do I.\"\n\nAs my Blackberry started to buzz under my chair with reaction to Bush's remarkable comments, the President wrapped up with his familiar Texan colloquialism.\n\n\"You know, this isn't my first rodeo,\" Bush said.\n\nHe continued, \"In other words, I haven't -- this is not the first time I've been in a campaign where people have expressed themselves and in different kinds of ways. But I have learned that, you know, if you focus on the big picture, which in this case is our nation and issues we need to work together on, you can get stuff done.\"", "Washington (CNN) The expected future chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee said in an interview with The Washington Post that the House will vote on protecting insurance guarantees for people with pre-existing conditions when Democrats are back in control of the chamber.\n\n\"We need a vote on pre-existing conditions right away,\" Rep. Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, told The Washington Post . \"We said that was one of the cornerstones of the (Affordable Care Act). After (Republicans) saw how badly their position was polling on it, they said they were for it.\"\n\nNeal's comments after Tuesday's elections followed a campaign season dominated by talk of health care, where many candidates on both sides pledged to support popular insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The protections have been one of the most popular portions of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, and Democrats have warned that Republicans pose a threat to the measure.\n\nObamacare transformed the health insurance landscape, particularly for those who are or have been sick. The health care law bans insurers from denying people policies or charging them more based on their medical histories. It also requires carriers to provide comprehensive coverage.\n\nThe popularity of these provisions is one of the reasons Republican lawmakers failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare last year.\n\nRead More"]
