["Pittsburgh (CNN) With police tape marking the barriers of their makeshift congregation, members of this city's grieving Jewish community welcomed the Sabbath outside of the Tree of Life Synagogue on Friday evening, an emotional act of worship and defiance just six days after the synagogue witnessed the worst anti-Semitic attack in American history.\n\nAbout 50 men locked arms and swayed, harmonizing in Hebrew under darkening skies, while police looked on and pilgrims laid stones and flowers at memorials for the 11 congregants who were slain last Saturday. The building is still closed while police process the crime scene.\n\nMembers of the Jewish faith gather outside the Tree of Life synagogue Friday evening for Shabbat services.\n\nMany of the women sang, too, though they stood off to the side, a separation common in the more conservative branches of Judaism. Children ran back and forth playing between their parents' legs. A father gently wiped tears from his teenage son's cheeks, consoling him softly as the congregation prayed.\n\nAt one point, the service was stopped to thank a member of the FBI who had helped the Chevrah Kadisha, the Jewish organization that helps prepare bodies for burial. Afterward, the congregation broke into \"Al Hanisim,\" a Hanukkah song that commemorates Jews' perseverance in the face of violent oppression. Though not normally a part of Shabbat services, no one had to ask why the song was appropriate to sing on this night.\n\n\"The Jewish people know from our history that, no matter how bad things seem, we can always pull together, we will always persevere,\" said Rabbi Sam Weinberg, principal of the Hillel Academy of Pittsburgh, whose students helped organize the Shabbat service through text messages on Friday.\n\nRead More", "The Trump administration is set to reimpose all sanctions against Iran that had been lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

More than 300 have been detained since May 2017, the group says, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement started targeting undocumented Iraqi immigrants with final deportation orders.\n\nMany fear for their safety, the ACLU says, if they are returned to Iraq, a country that some have not lived in for decades. Some are Chaldean Christians or members of oppressed Muslim sects and fear being persecuted, tortured or killed if returned.\n\nAbout 110 of those Iraqi nationals remain in ICE custody in 33 facilities nationwide.\n\nIraq's willingness to take in deported nationals has been the basis of the US government's argument to keep them detained until their immigration cases are decided. But recently unsealed documents, including memos and emails from US officials and a letter from an Iraqi official, show that Iraq has hesitated to allow the \"forced return\" of Iraqi nationals.\n\nIraqi officials re-emphasized to CNN on Friday their unwillingness to take in Iraqis who have been forcibly removed.\n\nAhmed Mahjoub, a spokesman for the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, told CNN the government encourages Iraqi nationals' return \"...if they are willing to come to their homeland and are ready to facilitate it through our diplomatic missions, but, again, we won't cooperate with any government trying to forcibly return them.\"\n\nACLU attorney Miriam Aukerman hopes the documents will encourage US District Judge Mark Goldsmith in Detroit to consider allowing those who have remained in detention the chance to be released so that they can be with their families while their cases move forward.\n\n\"These individuals have lost all of 2018 based on misrepresentations to the court by ICE,\" Aukerman said. \"The judge cannot give them back the months and months that they've been behind bars ... but the judge can let them go and let them return to their families. It prevents the injustice from continuing.\"\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to questions about the case. Due to ongoing litigation, ICE had no comment, an agency spokesperson said.\n\nAbout 1,400 Iraqi nationals living in the US as of Thursday have had final orders of removal and could be affected by the outcome of this case, ACLU said.\n\nBack and forth with Iraq\n\nICE began detaining Iraqi nationals with deportation orders around May 15, 2017, according to court documents.\n\nDuring the nearly 18 months that this case has been underway, the government has given repeated assurances that Iraq would be willing to accept these detainees.\n\nIn the past few months, Goldsmith ordered many of the documents with information about correspondence between the US and Iraq unsealed, showing the behind-the-scenes struggles US officials have faced in trying to deport the detained Iraqis and what they said publicly.\n\nJohn Schultz, who serves as the deputy assistant director for the Removal Management Division East for ICE, said in a sworn declaration filed publicly as part of this case in July 2017 that \"due to renewed discussions between the United States and Iraq in recent months, Iraq has agreed, using charter flights, to the timely return of its nationals that are subject to final orders of removal.\"\n\nBut just days before Schultz's testimony was entered into the case, Iraqi officials expressed concern that detainees \"are at risk if they return to Iraq,\" the ACLU revealed in court documents filed last month.\n\nOne day before Schultz's testimony was entered, an internal ICE memo said that \"ICE and the US Department of State have collaborated to engage Iraq ... these and other diplomatic efforts ... have failed to yield substantive progress regarding the removal of Iraqi nationals,\" according to the ACLU's filing.\n\nEfforts to deport Iraqis were halted when Goldsmith granted a preliminary injunction on July 24, 2017, that prevents the government from deporting the Iraqis until they have had an opportunity to have their cases decided in immigration court.\n\nThe administration has argued for their speedy removal, in part, because \"many\" of them were \"ordered removed on the basis of committing criminal offenses ... who have demonstrated their disregard for the country's laws and willingness to harm others,\" according to a court filing.\n\nAs the case has moved forward, recent correspondence from Iraq shows its attitude toward taking deportees has not changed, according to a letter from Iraq's minister of migration and displaced, written on July 29, 2018.\n\n\"We have received information indicating that some countries which host Iraqi nationals intend to forcibly return them ... ,\" writes Jassim Mohamed Mohamed Ali, the then-minister of migration and the displaced in Iraq.\n\n\"Since this issue contravenes the policy of the State and international law and norms, please ensure that all our embassies and consulates in the countries that host Iraqi nationals are ensuring they are not subject to deportation or forced return,\" he added.\n\nAfter Goldsmith allowed the unsealing of some documents in this case, Auckerman said those documents show that the government's insistence that the conversations with Iraq are ongoing is incorrect.\n\n\"We have been down this road before, and we know from the documents we have seen that Iraq is very resistant to taking people who don't want to return,\" Auckerman said. \"Part of the reason for that is Iraq understands these individuals face very real danger if they are returned.

The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN .\n\nI heard it in 2017, from a researcher at an annual sex researchers' conference in Montreal. This expert was describing straight women who were distressed because they didn't feel desire for their husbands or long-term partners. Wanting to keep their men happy, these women often had sex anyway, with a resigned attitude and little thought to their own pleasure.\n\nThe mere existence of the term \"service sex\" suggests it is common enough to need a name. Several therapists I interviewed while researching \"UNTRUE,\" a book about female sexuality, told me that in their experience it was a common problem for couples, with women more likely to be the ones providing service with less than a smile. Yet many straight women in long term relationships may think service sex is as natural as the air we breathe -- horny husbands and disinterested wives are a recurring, nearly inescapable trope in pop culture and since Darwin, science is rife with studies about ardent males and reluctant females.\n\nIt's easy to argue \"service sex\" is just a fancy term for being a good wife or girlfriend. The problem with this belief is that it equates female goodness with sacrificing one's sexual pleasure for someone else's.\n\nPlenty of us have sex once in a while to make our partners happy. But regular service sex is something else -- an arguably destructive habit fostered by specific social conditions, a symptom that something is amiss in not just our sex lives, but in our larger lives, and the culture more generally.\n\nIt's time for a revolution. At the polls, and in the bedroom. And in our understanding of who women are, sexually and otherwise. Given the tight interweaving of economic and political power with sexual entitlement, female sexual autonomy has never been more urgent, and women's sexual pleasure has never been more political. Let's consider what it might mean to go on a sex strike of sorts -- to get what we want, rather than give what we think we owe others.\n\nSex and status are linked. Where men have the tightest grip on resources and power, our society (including the women in their lives) will prioritize their pleasure -- and create false narratives about what women deserve, sexually and otherwise. To wit: in 2018, the number of female CEOs of US Fortune 500 companies dropped 25%, to 24 women total among hundreds of men leading industry, tech, manufacturing, and other sectors. On a more workaday level, according to World Bank data cited by TheGlobalEconomy.com the US ranks an unimpressive 76th out of 180 countries worldwide for female labor force participation.\n\nAmerican women, particularly women of color, continue to earn a fraction of the dollar that white men do -- 63 cents for black women; 55 for Native women; 54 for Latinas. Even worse, we are 104th out of 193 countries ranked for female political participation (beaten out by Namibia, Burundi, and Belarus, among others). These numbers are astonishingly low when we consider that the US is the world's largest economy. Those who can't lead or even earn on par must serve. And in America, in restaurants, in businesses, and in bed, it is women who serve men.\n\nA women's sex strike against service sex, a refusal to do it out of a sense of obligation, would force us to confront these basic inequalities. Our current administration has amped up the notion that women are mere extensions of male will and pleasure, there to serve at every turn. What is the rollback of reproductive rights but an assertion that not only female reproduction but female sexuality itself belong to what science writer Natalie Angier calls the \"Greater Male Coalition\"? What are the President's insults to Stormy Daniels other than assertions that the woman who enjoys sex or profits from it in any way -- emotionally, financially, or physically -- is unnatural, immoral, and unattractive? In this world order, female sexual autonomy is not only dangerous and destabilizing; it is increasingly hard to imagine. And female pleasure is irrelevant, even pathological, if it exists at all.\n\nSome women under the current administration may be fine with this paradigm, but they are fundamentally yoked to male desires and agendas, never to exist outside or without them. This basic and deeply personal form of degradation, in which even women's desires aren't our own, both reinforces and reflects a hierarchy where men matter more.\n\nResetting the balance so women no longer provide service sex is not in itself a comprehensive answer to gendered inequalities, of course. But making sex female-focused and female-pleasure-centric could begin to force other shifts in thinking in important ways. When we cease to consider what women like and want as foreplay and reframe it as the main event, for example, we begin to challenge, from the most intimate and private and emotionally powerful place, a long-accepted, deeply believed but nearly invisible world view, and make an impossible-to-miss statement about who and what counts. In the ancient Greek comedy by Aristophanes, the character Lysistrata urges women to go on a sex strike to get men on both sides to end the Peloponnesian War. In our case, a sex strike against service sex can be a powerful statement -- that female desire, a metric of agency like women's votes, will be heard.\n\nMeanwhile, surprising newer science -- much of it done by female researchers, field scientists, and other experts -- is telling us what women want and need. In a radical upending of long-held stereotypes I think of as The Great Correction, they have discovered that when measured correctly, the female libido is as \"strong\" as the male. They have learned that the overfamiliarity with a spouse and the institutionalization of the relationship that accompany companionate domesticity actually dampen female desire in ways they don't male desire -- suggesting long-term, monogamous relationships may actually be harder for women than for men.\n\nAnthropologist Meredith Small has noted that the single most documented preference across species of female primates is ... a taste for sexual novelty. Canadian researchers found that straight women's bodies respond to a greater range of sexual stimuli than heterosexual men's, calling into question the easy presumption that it is men who have wide and varied sexual menus. Other research and experts like Esther Perel tell us of female study participants and patients who find the security and comfort of their marriages -- the very things we are taught women crave -- to be anaphrodisiacs that blunt their lust\n\nFor more opinion...

Without it, many of us find our libidos wither. And then we may resign ourselves to serving what we think others deserve, rather than feeling entitled to get ours and get off.\n\nWomen don't owe men a thing. If anything, the statistics show, we are owed. It's time to make sex and sexual pleasure female-centric. Each couple, each woman, will have to find out what female sexual adventure and pleasure means for them. But the idea of a sex strike suggests exciting possibilities beyond the bedroom. What would not just sex but the world look like if we prioritized what women want in every sex act? How might the political, social, and sexual landscapes all shift if we acknowledged that in many cases, the server is unsatisfied -- and actually believed it was important to set things right?", "(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller has copies of vitriolic and sometimes threatening messages that Roger Stone directed at Randy Credico, a witness in the investigation, according to sources familiar with the investigation.\n\nInvestigators have been examining the text messages and emails and questioning witnesses about whether there was an attempt to harass or intimidate Credico, according to people familiar with the matter. Stone, a longtime political adviser to President Donald Trump, has claimed that Credico, a progressive New York political activist and radio host, served as his backchannel to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. Credico has denied that he acted as an intermediary.\n\nCNN has obtained copies of some of the messages. In one exchange, Stone responds to the news that Credico received a subpoena from Mueller\n\n\"Waste of your time -- tell him to go f--- himself,\" Stone wrote.\n\n\"Who?\" Credico asked.\n\n\"Mueller,\" Stone said.\n\nOther messages in April show Stone accusing Credico of cooperating with Mueller.\n\n\"Everyone says u are wearing a wire for Mueller,\" Stone wrote in one message. Another said: \"vital people know you are wearing a wire and narching for Mueller to f--- Assange.\"\n\nThe messages raise the possibility that Mueller could pursue obstruction or witness tampering charges against Stone. Stone said he has not been contacted by Mueller's investigators. But nearly a dozen of his current and former associates have been summoned for interviews or for testimony before Mueller's grand jury\n\n\"Our text and email messages have to been seen in their totality to see the (sic) is no serious effort to intimidate or pressure Randy to do anything, other than fess up to the truth,\" Stone said in a statement to CNN, adding that he encouraged Credico to tell the truth in other messages.\n\nStone said his comments about wearing a wire were a joke and added he didn't believe Credico had actually been subpoenaed.\n\nMueller's team charged Paul Manafort and an associate with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for reaching out to potential witnesses after Manafort was indicted on tax and other charges and attempting to coach their possible testimony.\n\nManafort pleaded guilty after he was convicted on eight criminal charges and is cooperating with the special counsel's investigation\n\n\"For me, you have to distinguish between the sort of spurned lover and the person that's truly intending to act or make a true threat in respect to what that person may have to offer the special counsel,\" said CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin.\n\nBut even if individual messages don't amount to obstruction, witness tampering or threats, if altogether \"they paint a picture of a guy who's trying to influence a witness who may have testimony against him, then that's more problematic,\" Zeldin said.\n\nA spokesman for the counsel's office declined to comment.\n\n\"Communications between Randy and Roger Stone to the extent that we have them have been provided to the special counsel,\" said Martin Stolar, an attorney for Credico. \"I'm not going to confirm the contents of any of them.\"\n\nStone and Credico have a complicated history that spans more than a decade. Over the years, they've worked together on political campaigns and called each other friends. But it has been a rocky friendship. For instance, at one point years ago, Stone started a rumor that Credico was dead.\n\nStone said he identified Credico as his backchannel reluctantly, which sparked outrage from Credico.\n\n\"When I told Randy that I might be forced to disclose his name as my lawyers were recommending after my appearance before the House Intelligence Committee, he did not react well. In fact he was furious saying I should be willing to go to jail rather than reveal his name,\" Stone previously told CNN. \"At no time did I ever suggest he not co-operate with any formal investigation or plead the 5th or do anything other than tell the truth.\"\n\nThe trove of messages between Stone and Credico demonstrates their fraught relationship. Both men hurl insults at one another via text message and email. Stone regularly slams Credico -- who has a history of drug and alcohol abuse -- as an alcoholic.\n\n\"Choke in your own vomit,\" Stone said in exchange. Credico hit back, accusing Stone of being a drug addict and a liar.\n\nAsked about the drug accusations, Stone told CNN his efforts to legalize marijuana are hardly a secret, but \"I actually prefer a cocktail.\"\n\n\"Our texts are the late night bickering of two grumpy political veterans, who have known each other for years.

El problema es que viv\u00edan en Texas, donde la ley estatal proh\u00edbe a los farmaceutas vacunar a personas menores de 7 a\u00f1os.\n\nLos m\u00e9dicos, que tambi\u00e9n estaban atendiendo a su reci\u00e9n nacido Cameron \u2013el tercero de sus hijos\u2013, decidi\u00f3 que vacunar\u00eda a Leon cuando fueran al pediatra nuevamente: en la cita anual de Tristan, de dos a\u00f1os, agendada para el 3 de enero.\n\nSin embargo, Leon muri\u00f3 antes de esa visita.\n\n\u201cNi siquiera estaba en mi radar como algo que realmente, realmente necesitaba priorizar\u201d, sostuvo Laura.\n\nLa historia de Sidaris le resulta demasiado familiar a la doctora Flor Mu\u00f1oz, especialista en enfermedades pedi\u00e1tricas infecciosas del Texas Children's Hospital. Durante 20 a\u00f1os, esta m\u00e9dica ha trabajado con la Academia Estadounidense de Pediatr\u00eda para aumentar la tasa de vacunaci\u00f3n contra la influencia en ni\u00f1os.\n\nLas cifras est\u00e1n lejos de ser excelentes. Apenas el 47,8% de los ni\u00f1os entre los 6 y 17 meses ha sido vacunado contra la influenza en el \u00faltimo a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan los CDC, que recomiendan que todas las personas mayores de 6 meses reciban la vacuna.\n\nY hay un problema adicional: los adultos pueden vacunarse en las farmacias o incluso en su trabajo, pero los ni\u00f1os no tienen estas opciones. En la mayor\u00eda de estados de EE.UU. existen l\u00edmites o prohibiciones absolutas para que los farmaceutas vacunen a los ni\u00f1os. Adem\u00e1s, las cl\u00ednicas de vacunaci\u00f3n contra la influenza en las escuelas no son la regla sino la excepci\u00f3n.\n\nSolo 13 estados permiten que los farmaceutass vacunen a los ni\u00f1os de cualquier edad, seg\u00fan la Alianza Nacional de Asociaciones de Farmacias Estatales (Naspa, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s).\n\n\u201cEs frustrante.

En este momento, explic\u00f3, es dif\u00edcil que esas entidades grandes cantidades de vacunas y facturen a los seguros.\n\nLos Sidari tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n poniendo de su parte. El mes pasado patrocinaron el evento \u201cDile B\u00fa a la Gripe\u201d en su ciudad natal de Albion, Nueva York, donde 59 ni\u00f1os fueron vacunados.\n\nSi bien los CDC insisten en las vacunaciones contra la gripe a finales de octubre todos los a\u00f1os, resulta especialmente importante hacerlo antes de las vacaciones, seg\u00fan Mu\u00f1oz. La actividad de la influenza puede alcanzar su punto m\u00e1ximo en diciembre, y las reuniones en las festividades ayuda a que el virus se propague m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidamente.

It is a serious step, and according to the OSCE, it has been invoked only seven other times since its establishment in 1991.\n\nChechnya has faced international outcry amidst reports of human rights abuses including torture, unlawful arrest and detentions, disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Many of these violations were reportedly carried out against gay men in the Russian republic.\n\nIn a statement to the Permanent Council invoking the mechanism, the 16 OSCE nations noted that their concerns \"centered around allegations of impunity for reported human rights violations and abuses in Chechnya from January 2017 to the present, including, but not limited to, violations and abuses against persons based on their perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as against human rights defenders, lawyers, independent media, civil society organizations, and others.\"\n\n\"In addition to establishing the facts and reporting on them, we encourage the mission of experts to give advice to the Russian Federation, to the OSCE, and to the international community on possible solutions to the questions raised,\" the OSCE statement said.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller has copies of vitriolic and sometimes threatening messages that Roger Stone directed at Randy Credico, a witness in the investigation, according to sources familiar with the investigation.\n\nInvestigators have been examining the text messages and emails and questioning witnesses about whether there was an attempt to harass or intimidate Credico, according to people familiar with the matter. Stone, a longtime political adviser to President Donald Trump, has claimed that Credico, a progressive New York political activist and radio host, served as his backchannel to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. Credico has denied that he acted as an intermediary.\n\nCNN has obtained copies of some of the messages. In one exchange, Stone responds to the news that Credico received a subpoena from Mueller\n\n\"Waste of your time -- tell him to go f--- himself,\" Stone wrote.\n\n\"Who?\" Credico asked.\n\n\"Mueller,\" Stone said.\n\nOther messages in April show Stone accusing Credico of cooperating with Mueller.\n\n\"Everyone says u are wearing a wire for Mueller,\" Stone wrote in one message. Another said: \"vital people know you are wearing a wire and narching for Mueller to f--- Assange.\"\n\nThe messages raise the possibility that Mueller could pursue obstruction or witness tampering charges against Stone.

Over the years, they've worked together on political campaigns and called each other friends. But it has been a rocky friendship. For instance, at one point years ago, Stone started a rumor that Credico was dead.\n\nStone said he identified Credico as his backchannel reluctantly, which sparked outrage from Credico.\n\n\"When I told Randy that I might be forced to disclose his name as my lawyers were recommending after my appearance before the House Intelligence Committee, he did not react well. In fact he was furious saying I should be willing to go to jail rather than reveal his name,\" Stone previously told CNN. \"At no time did I ever suggest he not co-operate with any formal investigation or plead the 5th or do anything other than tell the truth.\"\n\nThe trove of messages between Stone and Credico demonstrates their fraught relationship. Both men hurl insults at one another via text message and email. Stone regularly slams Credico -- who has a history of drug and alcohol abuse -- as an alcoholic.\n\n\"Choke in your own vomit,\" Stone said in exchange. Credico hit back, accusing Stone of being a drug addict and a liar.\n\nAsked about the drug accusations, Stone told CNN his efforts to legalize marijuana are hardly a secret, but \"I actually prefer a cocktail.\"\n\n\"Our texts are the late night bickering of two grumpy political veterans, who have known each other for years.

My parents, enchanted by the promise of a better life and working their way into American society, planted their Indian roots in a northern Jersey suburb in the early 1980s where a dozen or so of my other family members would eventually migrate over the next two decades. We would go on to become cooks, mailmen, doctors, journalists, nurses and real estate agents, and disperse along the East Coast to places like New York, Washington, North Carolina, Virginia and Connecticut.\n\nNaaz Modan\n\nBut the American dream that my mother and father realized nearly 40 years ago, beyond JFK's terminal gates with green cards in hand, is under attack. President Donald Trump says he intends to revoke the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment -- which guarantees citizenship for all children born in the United States -- via executive order. Regardless of the constitutionality of this, it directly targets the right to an American identity that many first-generation Americans like myself claim.\n\nI was raised with a hodgepodge of identities: Muslim, Indian, American, child of immigrants. Despite the different facets of my background -- and perhaps because of them -- I have always carried a United States passport and placed a check mark next to \"US citizen\" without a second thought. I have always entertained the possibility that I could one day run for president if my whims led me to.\n\nNow, my American-ness is being called into question. Just as it was following September 11th and the 2016 elections, my identity is once again a subject of debate. Is my life less \"American\" just because I was born to naturalized citizens who have spent a majority of their lifetime on American soil?\n\nWhat may come as a surprise to self-proclaimed nationalists like Trump is that not only am I as American as the next citizen, but, in many ways, my story and the story of many other first-generation citizens is the American story that historian James Truslow Adams famously spelled out. In 1931, Adams coined the term \"the American dream,\" which he described as \"that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability and achievement,\" regardless of circumstance of birth. We are the walking, talking, realized American dream.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Two states have just outpaced their early voting at this point in the 2016 presidential election: Kansas by almost 25,000 votes and West Virginia by over 1,000 votes. This could signal voter excitement this year, but it also tracks with a general move toward early voting in the US.\n\nFirst time voters\n\nThe percentage of early voters that are first time voters is substantial.\n\nOf the states for which Catalist has provided data to CNN, first-time voters have cast 5% or more of the early vote in 10 states.\n\nAlthough this data is not compared with first time voters of cycles past, it is helpful to get a snapshot of newly participating voters this cycle.\n\nIt is expected that the share of first-time registrants among the 18 to 21 age group bracket would be substantial, given many in that group were not old enough to vote in a previous election.\n\nBut the CNN analysis found a notable portion of first-time voters this cycle are in their 20s and 30s.\n\nIn Nevada, over 10% of the early voting electorate are first-time voters.\n\nAmong those 22-29 years old, 13% are first-timers, and among voters 30-39 years old, 10% are newly registered.\n\nNorth Dakota also has a high percentage of first-time voters from a wide range of ages. Ten percent of all early voters are registered for the first time. Among those 22-29 years old, more than a quarter are first-timers. For early voters 30-39 years old, first-timers make up 17% of the early voters.\n\nSeven percent of Arizona's early voting population are first time voters. Twelve percent of voters 22-29 years old are new, and among those 30-39 years old, 8% are newly registered.\n\nArizona, Montana, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida all have groups of first-time voters that hover around or higher than five percent.\n\nEarly voting in competitive House districts\n\nGoing a step closer, CNN also analyzed Catalist data to determine the share of first-time voters in several key House races.\n\nIn the Texas 7th District, which is a Tossup in CNN's Key Race ratings, and where Republican Rep. John Culberson faces off against Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, nearly 9% of all early voters 22-29 years old are registered for the first time. Another 6% of those in their 30s are new. By contrast, senior voters in the district ages 65 and up have barely above 1% of their ranks being new to the game.\n\nIn the hotly contested Texas 23rd, a Lean Republican district where Republican and CIA veteran Rep. Will Hurd is battling Iraq War veteran and Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, the same pattern is evident. Nearly 8% of those between 22-29 years old are newly registered, and for those in their 30s, it's 6%. For seniors 65 and up? Less than 2% are new.\n\nIn the fight for the open seat in Florida's 15th District, a Tossup, about 7% of voters are between 22-29 years old are first-timers. That compares to senior citizens 65 and up, where only 2% are first-timers.\n\nThe same proportion of 22-29 year olds are first time registrants in Florida's 27th District, while there seniors make up less than 2% of new voters.\n\nOther key races are more mixed. Only about 3% of those 22-29 years old are new in the New Jersey 3rd, another Tossup, and only slightly more among those in their 30s.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

That ad was backed by supporters of George H.W. Bush's presidential campaign. It depicted Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis as responsible for the rape Horton, a convicted murderer, committed while out of prison while furloughed under a Massachusetts program.

That doesn't mean shoot them. But we're going to arrest those people quickly and for a long time.\"\n\nThe defense officials described the force DHS requested as something that would only be used if CPB personnel were overwhelmed by the situation on the border.\n\nEven so, the Pentagon rejected the request for the reserve \"protection\" force, while it simultaneously approved all of DHS' other requests for support with Secretary of Defense James Mattis' approval. It's not clear if Mattis weighed in on the decision to reject the request for troops to perform law enforcement functions.\n\nThe first defense official said that in its response to DHS, the Defense Department said that if Homeland Security officials still want the reserve force of US troops, they should ask the White House to formally grant the Pentagon the authorities to perform those additional functions.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection declined to comment.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, speaking to Fox News last week, said DHS had asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support, as well as vehicle barriers and \"ways in which we can protect my officers and agents, as well as the ports of entry themselves.\"\n\nThe Posse Comitatus law forbids the US military from enforcing domestic laws, unless there's no other choice. Military analysts say Trump can easily use the National Guard, US Marshals or personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to back up border officers if need be.\n\nCosts of the operation\n\nMore than 8,000 active duty troops could be deployed troops to the southwest border, more than he has serving in some of the world's most contentious combat zones, but they are there solely to support Homeland Security officials as they prepare for the migrants' arrival.\n\nThe troops will join over 2,000 National Guardsmen who are already at the border, meaning upwards of 10,000 American forces will be mobilized to stop Central American migrants that are still some hundreds of miles away from the border and weeks away from arriving in the US\n\nSenior military officers have defended the deployment on national security grounds, but the mission -- dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot -- has been met with scathing criticism from many former military officials.\n\nRetired Gen. Martin Dempsey, who served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2011 to 2015, tweeted Friday that \"our men and women in uniform are better trained, better equipped, and better led so they meet any threat with confidence. A wasteful deployment of over-stretched soldiers and Marines would be made much worse if they use force disproportional to the threat they face. They won't.\"\n\nThe Pentagon has yet to determine the cost of the operation, nor has it identified the account where the funding would come from. But the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimates that the cost of placing active duty troops on the border could range from $42 million 110 million.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Up to 15,000 troops going to the border Replay More Videos ...

CSBA also estimates that the use of military aircraft in this deployment would cost about $136,645 per day.\n\nWith the mission currently set for November 5 through December 15, for a total of 41 days, the cost of deploying 8,000 troops and air support ranges from approximately $42 million to $55 million, according to the CSBA estimate.\n\nTrump has said the total number of troops could climb as high as 15,000 , which CSBA calculates the price tag to be at approximately $90 million to $110 million.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump claimed the military is putting up thousands of tents to hold migrants, but officials said there are no plans as of now to build tents. The officials said that while there had been informal talks between the Department of Defense and DHS about having the military build tent facilities to house detained migrants, tents were never part of the formal request for assistance submitted by DHS and approved by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. One official says that DHS was informally discouraged from making the request by the defense department.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to make clear that the Department of Defense officials viewed the request as a law enforcement role.

Granted, the laws aren't often enforced. (It's more of a \"someone gently asks you to stop\" kind of thing.) But that doesn't mean you should test the rules.\n\nFlorida: You can't take photos in polling places and can't show your completed ballots to others. If you didn't know, you're not alone. In July, You can't take photos in polling places and can't show your completed ballots to others. If you didn't know, you're not alone. In July, three politicians got busted for taking photos of their primary ballots , not knowing they were violating the law. Whoops!\n\nGeorgia: No photography in polling places + no cell phone use in polling places = no selfies.\n\nIllinois: One of the most anti-selfie states in the country. Photography is not allowed at the polling place and its law states, \"any person who knowingly marks his ballot or casts his vote on a voting machine or voting device so that it can be observed by another person ... shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.\"\n\nIowa: No photos are allowed in the voting booths.\n\nMaryland: Per Maryland's voter information page , \"You cannot use your cell phone, pager, camera, and computer equipment in an early voting center or at a polling place.\" Remember guys, NO PAGERS.\n\nMichigan: No cameras in polling places.\n\nNew Jersey: Don't share your ballot online and don't take pictures. New Jersey law prohibits voters from showing their ballot to anyone else and officials say photographs aren't allowed inside polling places.\n\nNew York: Nope. Last year, a federal judge even Nope. Last year, a federal judge even upheld a state law barring voters from taking photos of their marked ballots.\n\nNorth Carolina: The only way you can take pictures is if you have the permission of the voter (you) -- and the permission of the chief judge of the precinct (not you). Considering the chief judge probably has better things to do, it's a no.\n\nOhio: It's illegal to show off your ballot online, so why bother?

Additionally, persons are not allowed to use mechanical or electronic devices to record sound or images within 100 feet of the voting stations.\" Listen to Keith.\n\nExercise selfie restraint\n\nLots of state laws don't specifically cover voting booth photos but are pretty clear on sharing marked ballots. There's plenty of reasons why this is totally understandable, but the most important one has to do with vote buying. There's no way anyone can know who you voted for unless you provide them with photo evidence.\n\nAlaska: State law says \"a voter may not exhibit the voter's ballot to an election official or any other person so as to enable any person to ascertain how the voter marked the ballot.\" That means no posting of marked ballot selfies.\n\nLouisiana: State law says voters may not \"allow a ballot to be seen\" or \"announce the manner in which a person has cast his ballot.\" So selfies are allowed, but not with a marked ballot.\n\nMassachusetts: No selfies with your ballot, people. But here again, there's little the state can do to enforce the law, says Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Secretary of the Commonwealth.\n\nMinnesota: Two statutes say showing others your marked ballot is a no-no. And that's what taking a pic or a video does.\n\nMississippi: There's no law against taking photos at the polling place, but the state prohibits a voter from showing his or her marked ballot to another person, says Leah Smith of the Mississippi Secretary of State's office. So no selfies of marked ballots.\n\nMissouri: Photos are allowed but the law here, like the other states on this list, prohibits voters from sharing their marked ballot, says Maura Browning, spokeswoman for the Secretary of State.\n\nOklahoma: Officials advise against taking pictures of marked ballots, but you can snap photos inside a polling place.

If you still simply must selfie, go ahead. Just consider the inimitable words of Ian Malcom from \"Jurassic Park \": You may be so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you may not stop to think if you should.\n\nArkansas: There's no law against taking selfies, says the Secretary of State's Office, as long as you're not being disruptive in the polling place or taking pictures of other people's ballots.\n\nCalifornia: Snap away, Californians!

Hurst of the Secretary of State's Office. But you could get in trouble if you're invasively taking pictures of other voters or election officials. Which you won't do. Right?\n\nIndiana: The state enacted a law in 2015 that banned ballot selfies. But a federal judge barred it from going into effect. So, you're good to go ... for now.\n\nKansas: \"It does not appear to be a crime under current law, but it's also not encouraged,\" a spokesman from the Office of Kansas' Secretary of State tells CNN.\n\nKentucky: \"We don't have a prohibition on people taking selfies. However, there is a prohibition in recording other people voting,\" says Bradford Queen of the Office of Kentucky's Secretary of State.\n\nMaine: Snap away.\n\nMontana: Snap away.\n\nNebraska: Vote and promote! Nebraska has Vote and promote! Nebraska has no problem with you posing next to the voting machines.\n\nNew Hampshire: A federal appeals court ruled A federal appeals court ruled a statewide ballot selfie ban unconstitutional . So you're good to go.\n\nNew Mexico: Do it for the 'gram! Voters can take pictures of themselves and their ballots at polling places, says a spokesman for the Secretary of State's Office -- just as long as they don't disturb normal operations or violate the privacy of others.\n\nNorth Dakota: No issues here.\n\nOregon: Oregon is a mail-in state, but there are no laws against snapping a pic of your ballot.\n\nPennsylvania: You can send your voting selfie to all your pals -- unless your polling location has signs prohibiting cell phones. You can send your voting selfie to all your pals -- unless your polling location has signs prohibiting cell phones.

You can take photos outside of the voting area, and you can take photos of your own ballot. But you can't take photos of other people's ballots or disrupt the process of voting with your little photo shoots.\n\nVirginia: You can take pictures, even of your completed ballot. But You can take pictures, even of your completed ballot. But if your picture-taking disrupts voting or intimidates other voters , you can be removed from the polling place.\n\nWashington: Yes, and here's why: \"Because Washington is a vote-by-mail state, there are no traditional polling places,\" Erich Ebel of the Office of Secretary of State tells CNN. \"Since 2011, voters across Washington have been able to vote from the comfort of their own homes and simply drop their sealed ballot-return envelopes into their daily mail or take them to one of hundreds of conveniently-located drop boxes. It is not illegal in Washington to take a selfie while doing either of those things, and in fact could possibly even encourage more people to get their own ballots submitted before the deadline.\" That's right, shame your peers, Washingtonians!\n\nWisconsin: Michael Haas of the state election commission tells CNN that yes, you may take a selfie, but workers may ask you to stop if you are creating a distraction. They also really suggest you don't post a selfie with your marked ballot. You won't get in trouble, but it will raise questions as to whether someone paid you to do so (which is majorly illegal).\n\nWyoming: Nothing says you can't, but don't be disruptive. \"In Wyoming there are no laws against ballot selfies.\" The law does allow judges of elections to \"preserve order at the polls by any necessary and suitable means,\" says Will Dinneen from Wyoming's Secretary of State's Office.", "New York (CNN) Twitter said Friday that it had deleted thousands of automated accounts that were posting messages discouraging people from voting in Tuesday's midterm elections.

rally in West Virginia admitted that Democrats could take the House.\n\n\"If Chuck Schumer, cryin' Chuck, and Nancy Pelosi, and the legendary Maxine Waters take power they will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We will be fighting. It will be ridiculous, frankly. It will be bad for the country,\" he continued. \"The Democrats -- and it could happen. Could happen. We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate. But it could happen, and you know what you do?\n\n\"My whole life, you know what I say? Don't worry about it. Just figure it out. Does that make sense? I'll just figure it out.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the President told reporters ahead of a campaign event that Republicans are \"doing well in the Senate and it looks like we're doing OK in the House. We're going to have to see.\"\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) A federal judge on Friday denied President Donald Trump's appeal to pause discovery in a lawsuit that alleges he violated a constitutional clause banning gifts and advantages from foreign and domestic governments, raising the possibility that transactions between the Trump International Hotel and foreign dignitaries might be made public.\n\nTrump's legal team had sought to delay turning over documents while it appeals a decision to allow other portions of the lawsuit to proceed. However, Friday's ruling, issued by US District Judge Peter Messitte, now clears the path for discovery to move forward on business dealings between the Trump Hotel and foreign dignitaries.\n\nThe case was brought by the governments of Washington, DC, and Maryland and argues the President has failed to comply with the emoluments clause through the Trump International Hotel.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 10: The Trump International Hotel is shown on August 10, 2017 in Washington, DC. The hotel, located blocks from the White House, has become both a tourist attraction in the nation's capital and also a symbol of President Trump's intermingling of business and politics. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nMaryland and DC have said the Trump International Hotel's operations put other nearby hotels and entertainment properties at a competitive disadvantage, and that the Trump hotel got special tax concessions for the hotel, which won its lease on a federally owned property before Trump's election.\n\n\"Accordingly, the President's ownership interest in the Trump International Hotel and his apparent receipt of benefits from at least some foreign and state governments, as well as from the Federal Government itself, suggest that he has received 'emoluments' in violation of the Constitution, giving rise to plausible causes of action against him brought by parties with standing,\" Friday's opinion read.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Despite the ongoing opioid crisis plaguing the nation, the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a new opioid medication five to 10 times more powerful than fentanyl.\n\nDsuvia, made by AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc., is a tablet in a single-dose, prefilled applicator to be administered under the tongue by health care providers to patients in settings such as hospitals, surgical centers and emergency rooms, according to the company.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb was quick to defended the approval in a statement Friday: \"The agency is taking new steps to more actively confront this crisis, while also paying careful attention to the needs of patients and physicians managing pain.\"\n\nFollowing the approval of Dsuvia, Gottlieb acknowledged that opioids are a unique class of medications. \"I recognize that the debate goes beyond the characteristics of this particular product or the actions that we're taking to mitigate this drug's risks and preserve its differentiated benefits. We won't sidestep what I believe is the real underlying source of discontent among the critics of this approval -- the question of whether or not America needs another powerful opioid while in the throes of a massive crisis of addiction,\" he said.\n\nBut the criticism was quick. \"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is recklessly and needlessly endangering people by approving a super-strong opioid,\" a statement from the public advocacy group Public Citizen said in response to the approval. The group noted that Dsuvia is five to 10 times more powerful than fentanyl and 1,000 times more potent than morphine.\n\n\"It is certain that Dsuvia will worsen the opioid epidemic and kill people needlessly,\" said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, founder and senior adviser of Public Citizen's Health Research Group.\n\n\"DSUVIA will not be available in retail pharmacies or for outpatient use. DSUVIA will only be distributed to health care settings certified in the DSUVIA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program following attestation by an authorized representative that the healthcare setting will comply with appropriate dispensing and use restrictions of DSUVIA,\" AcelRx said.\n\nOther restrictions, according to the FDA, include that it cannot be used for more than 72 hours and will have the same black-box warnings as are required for all opioids about the risk of misuse and abuse that can lead to addiction and overdose death.\n\n\"Because of the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse with opioids; Dsuvia is also to be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative pain treatment options have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, where existing treatment options have not provided adequate analgesia, or where these alternatives are not expected to provide adequate analgesia,\" according to a statement from Gottlieb about the drug's approval.\n\nThe statement noted the benefit the drug could have for soldiers injured on the battlefield. It notes that the Department of Defense was involved in its development and that it was a priority for the Pentagon because it \"fills an unmet need.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe same drug, with the chemical name sufentanil, is already available as an IV medication. In its newly approved form, it is an option for patients with acute pain who are not able to receive an IV or are unable to swallow a pill. Dsuvia was approved by the European Medicines Agency in June under the name Dzuveo.\n\nDsuvia was rejected by an FDA advisory committee in 2017 because the committee wanted more data. AcelRx returned to the committee this year, and on October 12 the drug was recommended for approval. It is expected to be available in the first quarter of next year.", "(CNN) HBO sent some ice and fire President Trump's way after he tweeted an image of himself that appropriated the font style and catch phrase from \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted to his social media account a photo of himself with the words: \"Sanctions are coming,\" a play on the well-known \"Game of Thrones\" saying, \"Winter is coming.\"\n\nHBO was quick to respond, saying in a statement to CNN: \"We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes.\"\n\nThe premium cable network also issued a more humorous response on Twitter, asking followers: \"How do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?\"\n\nHow do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki? \u2014 HBO (@HBO) November 2, 2018\n\nAuthor George R.R.

day before, when he claimed rocks thrown by migrants crossing into the United States would be considered the same as gunfire.\n\n\"They won't have to fire,\" Trump said, referring to the military's response to the hypothetical rock throwing. \"What I don't want is I don't want people throwing rocks. It's turned out, in fact, it was just announced by (the Department of) Homeland Security, you have in just certain areas over 300 people that they know are trouble. What they did to Mexican military is disgrace.\"\n\n\"They were throwing rocks in their face. They do that with us, they're going to be arrested. There's going to be a problem. I didn't say shoot,\" he said. \"They do that with us they're going to be arrested for a very long time.\"\n\n\"If our soldiers or Border Patrol or ICE are going to be hit in the face with rocks, we're going to arrest those people. That doesn't mean shoot them. But we're going to arrest those people quickly and for a long time,\" Trump added.\n\nBut on Thursday, the President suggested that the US troops he dispatched to the US-Mexico border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks at them.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The political campaign video depicting a cop killer from Mexico that's become a key part of President Donald Trump's closing argument for the midterm elections isn't just an attempt to appeal to people's anxieties about immigration and crime, it's also based on a misleading \u2014 if not outright false \u2014 claim.\n\nThe video shows Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man convicted in February of the 2014 slaying of two California deputies, declaring in court that he wanted to kill more cops, while text overlaid on the screen says, \"Democrats let him into our country\" and \"Democrats let him stay.\" A review of his case, however, shows multiple interactions with both local and federal officials during Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as noted anti-immigration firebrand Joe Arpaio, former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona.\n\nThe video has been denounced by Democrats and some Republicans as racist for comparing Bracamontes with the caravans of migrants heading toward the US from Central America. But beyond the attempt to taint a group of people with the horrific actions of one, the details of Bracamontes' story also show it's simply false to blame Democrats for his entrance into the US.\n\nBracamontes had been arrested, been deported and re-entered the country multiple times before the 2014 killings, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. An Immigrations and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman told CNN in 2014 following his arrest that Bracamontes was arrested and deported twice, first in 1997 and then 2001, under the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.\n\nThe last time he was known to have entered the US from Mexico was during the Bush administration, according to records obtained by the Sacramento Bee , which covered the killing of the two deputies, who were based in the area.\n\nBracamontes was arrested multiple times in Maricopa County and jailed by Arpaio, who was pardoned by Trump last year after he was convicted of criminal contempt.\n\nBracamontes was arrested in Maricopa County on drug charges in 1996, according to county court records, and was deported by ICE in 1997, the agency said. \"He was booked into the jails I run for drug-related convictions,\" Arpaio said in 2014, according to the Arizona Republic . \"He was evidently turned over to ICE and had been deported on two occasions.\"\n\nBracamontes quickly returned to the US, and was arrested again by Arpaio in 1998, then released \"for reasons unknown,\" the Bee reported.\n\nBracamontes was arrested yet again in 2001 on drug charges in Maricopa County, and was deported three days later. It's not clear when exactly he re-entered the country, but marriage records show he was back in the US by 2002. He was married in Maricopa County on Feb. 28, 2002, according to the Bee.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with National Public Radio, Arpaio expressed regret that Bracamontes had \"slipped through the cracks.\"\n\n\"I don't know how many times he was arrested and slipped through the cracks. It's my gut feeling it wasn't just two times he's been deported,\" Arpaio said. CNN was unable to reach Arpaio for comment.\n\nThe Trump video pivots from expletive-filled court footage of Bracamontes to scenes of migrant groups making their way through Mexico toward the US border \u2014 an overt suggestion that criminals like Bracamontes would be part of the caravan as the screen flashes \"Who else would Democrats let in?\"\n\nThe video is part of a fear-based closing argument from Trump on immigration before Tuesday's election, which has included the President's announcement that up to15,000 US troops could be sent to the border, his call to end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship and his stated intention to restrict US asylum rules.\n\nTrump has pushed all of these as efforts to stop the caravan despite the fact that the migrants are still weeks \u2014 or even months \u2014 away from reaching the US border.\n\nThe tenor of the new video and the flurry of immigration announcements have been condemned by Democrats, and some moderate Republicans have also denounced them\n\n\"This is a sickening ad,\" tweeted Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who is retiring. \"Republicans everywhere should denounce it.\"\n\nCNN's reporting on the ground with the migrants has shown a different picture than the one painted by Trump. During a week traveling with the migrants, CNN witnessed little, if any, organization. The people traveling have joined and left at will, CNN has reported, and say they are traveling in search of jobs and to escape hate and persecution.\n\nTrump's Bracamontes video is hardly the only Republican campaign ad that's suggested the migrants, traveling in groups, pose a threat to the US. Numerous GOP candidates in competitive races, including Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have focused on the migrants in the closing days of the campaign.\n\n\"If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican,\" Trump said at his Missouri rally on Thursday. \"These are tough people. These are not angels. These are not little angels. These are tough people. And we're not letting them into our country. They're not coming in illegally.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a \"myth vs. fact\" press release on Thursday that \"270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\" It's not clear how the Trump administration arrived at that number. A DHS official would not elaborate because it was \"law enforcement sensitive.\"\n\nFriday morning, in comments at the Council on Foreign Relations, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen acknowledged that people legitimately seeking asylum are also part of the migrant group in addition to the criminals the administration is focusing on. \"(They) are proving to be quite violent. They are covering their faces, they are attacking the federal police there, attacking the military in Mexico,\" Nielsen said. \"They are putting the migrants, who are in the caravan, who are seeking asylum, at risk.\"", "Washington (CNN) Michael Cohen claimed that President Donald Trump used racist language in several private conversations with him during the time he worked as Trump's personal lawyer and \"fixer.\"\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair that published Friday, Cohen recalled four times that Trump made denigrating comments to him about black people.\n\nCNN has confirmed from a source close to Cohen that the Vanity Fair story and quotes are accurate. The White House did not respond to Vanity Fair's multiple requests for comment. CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nCohen alleged that Trump made a disparaging comment about African-American voters when they were discussing the turnout for one of his 2016 campaign rallies.\n\n\"I told Trump that the rally looked vanilla on television. Trump responded, 'That's because black people are too stupid to vote for me,' \" the President's former lawyer told the magazine.\n\nRead More", "\u062a\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0631\u064a\u0641 \u062d\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0626\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0639\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a\u060c \u062c\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u062d\u0642 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0633\u060c \u0625\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0647\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0625\u0630 \u064a\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0642\u0635\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 60% \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0627\u0636\u0637\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0628\u0648\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0645\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0629\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0628\u0648\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0631\u064a\u0641 \u062d\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0628\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0633\u0631\u064a\u0639\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0644\u0644\u0637\u0644\u0628\u0629.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u060c 02 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "El m\u00fasico explica c\u00f3mo fue el proceso de creaci\u00f3n de esta canci\u00f3n, pero tambi\u00e9n habla sobre m\u00fasica y mucho m\u00e1s\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Vetusta Morla es un grupo madrile\u00f1o con 20 a\u00f1os de carrera a sus espaldas. Sin embargo, parece que fue en 2017 y 2018 cuando su \u00e9xito explot\u00f3: congregaron a 40.000 almas en el recinto de la Caja M\u00e1gica de Madrid y recibieron tres nominaciones a los Latin Grammy por su \u00faltimo trabajo, 'Mismo Sitio. Distinto Lugar'.\n\nSu compositor, Guille Galv\u00e1n, quien tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 nominado por la canci\u00f3n \u2018Consejo de Sabios\u2019, habla llano sobre la carrera de la banda y c\u00f3mo asimilar los \u00e9xitos. Tambi\u00e9n sobre sus canciones y lo que quieren decir con ellas. La nominada habla de puentes: \u201cOjal\u00e1 que los muros que quedan en el mundo tengan los d\u00edas contados\u201d, expresa en entrevista con CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, haciendo menci\u00f3n directa al muro que separa M\u00e9xico de Estados Unidos, pero tambi\u00e9n a muchos otros.\n\nConversa sobre m\u00fasica, la suya, pero tambi\u00e9n la latinoamericana, de la que tanto han aprendido. Cuenta que cada a\u00f1o visitan Am\u00e9rica Latina y habla de todas las bandas con las que han compartido aprendizajes. Galv\u00e1n opina sobre el papel de los artistas, sobre los hombres y el feminismo y sobre las redes sociales en la vida diaria. Una conversaci\u00f3n con calma pese a tener los minutos contados: justo al terminar ten\u00edan ensayo previo a un peque\u00f1o concierto solidario en Madrid.\n\nMIRA: J Balvin y Rosal\u00eda lideran las nominaciones a la 19 edici\u00f3n de los Latin Grammy\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol: \u00bfC\u00f3mo se digiere pasar de ser alternativos, casi desconocidos, a llenar el recinto de la Caja M\u00e1gica de Madrid y despu\u00e9s ser nominados a los Grammy?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: La verdad es que la carrera de Vetusta siempre ha sido como muy gradual. Antes de hacer un gran paso siempre hemos dado peque\u00f1os saltitos. El concierto de la Caja M\u00e1gica, que a d\u00eda de hoy ha sido el m\u00e1s multitudinario que hemos hecho en nuestra carrera, ha sido la consumaci\u00f3n o la consecuencia de toda la gira de \u2018Mismo sitio. Distinto lugar\u2019.\n\nY la verdad es que pasar por todas esas peque\u00f1as etapas antes de llegar a la gran etapa nos ha permitido siempre vernos un poco desde fuera. No digerir los \u00e9xitos de una manera ajena. Normalmente siempre nos pillan trabajando. Aunque desde fuera un concierto como el de la Caja M\u00e1gica sea una cosa extraordinaria, que lo es, desde nuestra percepci\u00f3n no deja de ser un d\u00eda de trabajo, la consecuci\u00f3n de muchos equipos, donde est\u00e1s m\u00e1s pendiente de hacer las cosas como las tengas que hacer que de lo que van a decir los peri\u00f3dicos al d\u00eda siguiente.\n\nEn cuanto a los Grammy, al final los premios son tambi\u00e9n el resultado del trabajo de la banda y de mucha gente que est\u00e1 alrededor. Uno no hace canciones para que le den premios pero es bonito saber que detr\u00e1s del trabajo hay reconocimientos. Que muchas veces llegan en el momento en el que tienen que llegar, pero no quiere decir que el tiempo anterior de la banda fuera menos meritorio. Es muy bonito. Yo me alegro mucho sobre todo por toda la gente que hay alrededor. Toda la gente que, gracias a esta nominaci\u00f3n, puede trabajar mejor en nombre del grupo y, sobre todo, por la oportunidad que nos da de volver a Am\u00e9rica.\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol: Tambi\u00e9n tienes una nominaci\u00f3n por \u2018Consejo de Sabios\u2019, \u00bfc\u00f3mo te sientes al respecto?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: La nominaci\u00f3n de \u2018Consejo de Sabios\u2019, aunque aparezca mi nombre por la autor\u00eda, yo la considero tambi\u00e9n una nominaci\u00f3n grupal porque al final una canci\u00f3n no deja de ser tambi\u00e9n el trabajo de mucha gente y yo he tenido la suerte de ponerle palabras y m\u00fasica, pero yo creo que detr\u00e1s de esa canci\u00f3n hay trabajo de los seis de la banda, hay trabajo de producci\u00f3n, y una idea de lo que quer\u00edamos contar.\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol: \u00bfY qu\u00e9 quer\u00edais contar en \u2018Consejo de Sabios\u2019?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: \u2018Consejo de Sabios\u2019 es una canci\u00f3n muy especial. Lo supimos desde el primer momento y ha sido una canci\u00f3n que representa muy bien lo que quiere decir el disco, que tiene que ver con saltar los muros que nos ponemos nosotros mismos para acercarnos y poder abrazar a los dem\u00e1s de manera libre y sana. Y, desde un punto de vista m\u00e1s puntual, tiene que ver con muchas cosas que est\u00e1n sucediendo en el mundo.\n\nEstamos en un momento de tender puentes y no de levantar muros. Y que los muros que quedan en el mundo ojal\u00e1 tengan los d\u00edas contados. Y no solo los de piedra. Hay muros en Ceuta, en Palestina, en el S\u00e1hara, en M\u00e9xico.\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol: \u00bfEn qu\u00e9 te inspiras cuando te pones a escribir una canci\u00f3n como \u2018Consejo de Sabios\u2019?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: Hay canciones que salen o se trabajan de una manera muy r\u00e1pida porque tienes muy claro desde el principio qu\u00e9 quieres que sean, y otras canciones que son m\u00e1s esquivas. Y \u2018Consejo de Sabios\u2019 es una canci\u00f3n que ten\u00eda muy claro, desde el punto de vista mel\u00f3dico y arm\u00f3nico, c\u00f3mo quer\u00eda que fuera. Pero, a veces, cuando las canciones a nivel musical est\u00e1n tan claras, desde el punto de vista de la letra o la tem\u00e1tica cuesta m\u00e1s llegar a ellas.\n\nQuer\u00eda contar algo que tuviera que ver con separaciones, con muros. No quer\u00eda que fuese una canci\u00f3n que hablase de Berl\u00edn [donde termin\u00f3 de escribirla], pero era como muy obvio desde el lugar en el que grab\u00e1bamos, mirando el muro delante. Me gustaba la idea de llevar el muro a 2017 y esa idea de lo que nos separa. Y que lo que nos separa al final crece en nuestras manos y no te lo imponen los dem\u00e1s, sino que parte de uno mismo. Eso es lo que creo que quer\u00eda contar. Se puede aplicar a una persona, a nosotros como colectivo\u2026 creo que es una canci\u00f3n que habla tambi\u00e9n del grupo, del momento en el que piensas que est\u00e1s agotado de ciertas cosas y que puedes reconvertirte o reconstruirte.\n\n\"Am\u00e9rica es nuestra segunda casa\"\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol: Hablemos de Am\u00e9rica, \u00bfc\u00f3mo se sienten all\u00e1?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: M\u00e9xico es quiz\u00e1 el lugar de Am\u00e9rica que m\u00e1s transitamos. Am\u00e9rica es nuestra segunda casa. Nuestro lugar de referencia desde \u2018Un d\u00eda en el mundo\u2019, pr\u00e1cticamente. Todos los a\u00f1os vamos una o dos veces y tenemos la suerte de tener much\u00edsima gente que nos sigue. Para nosotros, ese viaje de ida y vuelta no es solo personalmente sino tambi\u00e9n musicalmente.\n\nNos sirve para distanciarnos de lo que somos aqu\u00ed y volver a un punto inicial. Porque all\u00ed en muchos pa\u00edses todav\u00eda estamos construyendo, y nos permite tambi\u00e9n tener contacto con la comunidad latina, que es m\u00fasica que en muchas ocasiones no llega hasta aqu\u00ed y nos permite tener una visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s amplia de lo que es el rock o la m\u00fasica en castellano, que es ampl\u00edsima. Tenemos una historia muy grande. A veces estamos demasiado pendientes de lo que se hace en el anglosaj\u00f3n, y yo creo que hoy en d\u00eda la m\u00fasica en castellano, en todos los g\u00e9neros, tiene mucho que decir y de hecho los Grammy Latino son premios que cada vez toman m\u00e1s fuerza.\n\nMIRA: Nombran a Man\u00e1 como Persona del A\u00f1o 2018 de los Latin Grammy\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol: \u00bfC\u00f3mo es su relaci\u00f3n con las bandas latinoamericanas?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: Casi todos los viajes iniciales en M\u00e9xico eran de la mano de Zo\u00e9, que es una banda amiga y la que nos permiti\u00f3 conocer de primera mano el mundo del rock mexicano ya a finales de la d\u00e9cada pasada.\n\nTe das cuenta viajando y conociendo a gente. Como con Jorge Drexler; tambi\u00e9n tuvimos la oportunidad en Uruguay de trabajar con No te va a Gustar, en Argentina con Lisandro Aristimu\u00f1o; tambi\u00e9n tenemos mucha relaci\u00f3n con Calamaro\u2026 gente que te cuenta cu\u00e1les han sido las dificultades en todos los pa\u00edses para que se consolide la m\u00fasica o el rock castellano. Y te ayuda mucho a entender los problemas que hemos tenido nosotros para salir adelante, porque en muchos casos han sido similares. En otros casos tambi\u00e9n ves c\u00f3mo el folclore y la m\u00fasica tradicional, lo local, se han ido incorporando al rock desde hace d\u00e9cadas y de qu\u00e9 manera tan brillante se ha hecho.\n\nTengo la sensaci\u00f3n de que a lo mejor en Espa\u00f1a durante tiempo ha habido m\u00e1s prejuicios con eso, porque estaba m\u00e1s separado cada uno de los g\u00e9nero y de los estilos. Creo que all\u00ed la comuni\u00f3n desde M\u00e9xico hasta Ushuaia (Argentina) es mayor que la que podemos tener aqu\u00ed. Parece que Espa\u00f1a es muy grande pero es una islita que no recibe siempre de la misma manera, o con toda la fluidez que deber\u00eda, las propuestas art\u00edsticas y musicales de Latinoam\u00e9rica.\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol: \u00bfHay alg\u00fan pa\u00eds que tengan especial ganas de ir, no solo por tocar all\u00ed, sino porque les llame especialmente la atenci\u00f3n su cultura?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: La verdad es que todos los pa\u00edses, musicalmente, son tremendos y muy inspiradores. Quiz\u00e1 Brasil es un pa\u00eds que tiene una cultura musical tan tremenda que es casi como un continente en s\u00ed mismo. Ahora hemos tenido la oportunidad de ir a pa\u00edses en los que no hemos estado, hemos estado en Per\u00fa. Nos queda ir a Ecuador, Venezuela, Panam\u00e1, Puerto Rico\u2026 tenemos tambi\u00e9n amigos all\u00ed. Edu [Cabra] y Ren\u00e9 [P\u00e9rez] de Calle 13, que tambi\u00e9n hemos hecho cosas con ellos y nos hablan muchas veces de c\u00f3mo se percibe la m\u00fasica all\u00e1.\n\nTengo la impresi\u00f3n de que, aunque no hayamos estado en ciertos sitios, s\u00ed que somos muy privilegiados porque tenemos la oportunidad de compartir muchas cosas con gente: cuando vienen, cuando vamos\u2026 y es muy rico. Porque s\u00ed que tenemos la sensaci\u00f3n de que en Vetusta Morla hay mucha parte de Latinoam\u00e9rica.\n\n'Me gusta la palabra feminismo'\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol: Entrando un poco m\u00e1s en temas de actualidad. En sus conciertos, mientras llega el momento de tocar, tienen un gran cartel que dice \u201cS\u00f3lo s\u00ed es s\u00ed\u201d. Es un mensaje muy potente, especialmente viniendo de hombres. \u00bfC\u00f3mo crees que los hombres, ustedes, pueden ayudar en la lucha feminista?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: Nosotros decidimos antes del comienzo de la gira abrir todos los conciertos con el lema \u2018Solo s\u00ed es s\u00ed\u2019 porque nos parece que, en eventos como son los conciertos o las fiestas, es un mensaje que tiene que quedar clar\u00edsimo para que, de una vez, se deje de ver con permisividad que haya no s\u00f3lo violaciones, sino abusos de todo tipo por parte de hombres a mujeres.\n\nHablo desde mi punto de vista, como Guille. A m\u00ed me parece que lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo con todo el movimiento feminista de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os es algo impepinable. No se puede avanzar socialmente si la mitad de la poblaci\u00f3n tiene menos derechos que la otra mitad. Entonces, asumo mi legado como hombre y, en ese sentido, soy consciente de que por serlo tengo m\u00e1s privilegios de los que puede tener una mujer. En ese caso, creo que lo que me toca es escuchar y aprender, m\u00e1s que ser yo como hombre quien diga lo que hay que hacer en la lucha feminista.

En \u2018Palmera en la Mancha\u2019 se empieza hablando del \u201cfalso gur\u00fa que sub\u00eda a Instagram fotos de pies que no eran suyos\u201d. Hilando esto con la reciente pol\u00e9mica que hubo en el programa \u2018Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo\u2019 con una letra de Mecano, el escritor Bob Pop dijo en una entrevista que \u2018en Espa\u00f1a tenemos demasiados influencers y faltan referentes\u2019. \u00bfEst\u00e1s de acuerdo?\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: Est\u00e1 claro que estamos todos en una \u00e9poca llena de mensajes y de referentes que muchas veces tienen poco soporte detr\u00e1s, porque no son m\u00e1s que un pseud\u00f3nimo detr\u00e1s de una cuenta de Twitter o de Facebook. Creo que el verbo o la importancia de lo que pensamos todos todo el rato est\u00e1 demasiado presente a cada momento. Se le da demasiada importancia y al mismo tiempo se olvida muy r\u00e1pidamente. Con lo cual, s\u00ed que estoy de acuerdo.\n\nPara ser referente, te lo tienes que currar durante mucho tiempo. Ser referente de algo te lo tienes que ganar durante tu profesi\u00f3n, tu vida. Las referencias en las culturas tradicionales eran los ancianos, porque ten\u00edan el conocimiento acumulado de las generaciones y se les guardaba un respeto. Quiz\u00e1s tengo la sensaci\u00f3n de que la fugacidad o la prisa con la que levantamos y tiramos a la gente hace, a lo mejor, a ciertas personas tener sobre sus hombros un peso que muchas veces ni quieren. En ese sentido creo que la frase [de Bob Pop] es cierta. A m\u00ed me gustan m\u00e1s los referentes que los gur\u00fas forzados de quita y pon.\n\nEn el caso de \u2018Palmeras en la Mancha\u2019, m\u00e1s que una cr\u00edtica es una s\u00e1tira. Yo creo que estamos todos ah\u00ed de una u otra manera. Pero lo interesante es ser conscientes y analizar que a lo mejor quiz\u00e1 muchas de esas cosas, a la larga, no nos van a hacer mejores personas, que es de lo que se trata. Bendita tecnolog\u00eda si nos hace mejores personas y si nos permite vivir m\u00e1s, que haya un reparto de la riqueza, la comida y el pensamiento. Pero si eso genera una ansiedad por ser igual que el otro y por el miedo que me da no tener los likes que tiene mi amigo, pues estamos convirtiendo esas herramientas en piedras en nuestro propio tejado.

Eres muy activo en redes sociales, \u00bflo haces libremente o por un poco de miedo de que no se olviden de ti? Por ejemplo, la cantautora Zahara reconoci\u00f3 que, cuando se retir\u00f3 por un tiempo de los escenarios, tuvo miedo de que se olvidaran de ella.\n\nGuille Galv\u00e1n: A m\u00ed me da miedo el olvido de los que me quieren. No me da miedo que ahora no me aplaudan o no me den un premio. Me da miedo que, cuando no me aplaudan o no me den un premio, no me quiera quien realmente me quiere. Utilizo las redes sociales, intento, aunque es dif\u00edcil, dejar mi vida de lado en redes sociales. No me gusta compartir mi intimidad. Creo que es de lo poco que nos queda: la intimidad y la libertad de desconectarnos. Y trato de usarlas de una manera sana en la comunicaci\u00f3n con gente a la que le gusta lo que hago y hacemos.\n\nCreo que estamos en un momento, quiz\u00e1, de fascinaci\u00f3n por el uso de la red social. Llegar\u00e1 un momento en el que nos demos cuenta de que nos est\u00e1n impidiendo hacer cosas que a lo mejor nos gustar\u00eda hacer. Yo creo que se acabar\u00e1n regulando o utilizando para cosas m\u00e1s pr\u00e1cticas. Por lo menos as\u00ed lo quiero ver.\n\nEn el lado negativo, muchas veces pienso que nos extinguimos a pasos agigantados. Pero as\u00ed trato de utilizarlas, y soy consciente de que el uso que hago de ellas muchas veces es mayor del que me gustar\u00eda, porque est\u00e1s pendiente de muchas cosas. A nivel del grupo me parece muy sano el uso de las redes sociales, que es informativo y una manera de compartir cosas. Las redes sociales tambi\u00e9n generan una falsa relaci\u00f3n de cari\u00f1o entre gente que no se conoce para nada y que a veces puede llevar a malentendidos. A m\u00ed esa parte me interesa poco, la verdad. Tengo mi vida, que me parece m\u00e1s saludable y m\u00e1s satisfactoria que lo que sucede ah\u00ed dentro.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

We are much closer to doing something. They want to make a deal,\" Trump said Friday outside the White House.\n\nA Bloomberg report overnight that the administration was already drafting terms sent global stocks higher early Friday -- but then National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow went on television to knock it down, telling CNBC \"there's no massive movement to deal with China.\"\n\nRead More", "The demand for living small is getting bigger.\n\nMore than half of Americans would consider living in a home that's less than 600 square feet, according to a survey done by the National Association of Home Builders. And among Millennials, interest increases to 63%.\n\n\"Tiny is inevitable,\" says Soren Rose, founder of Klein , which in 2017 began seeking out renowned architects to design tiny prefab homes.\n\nWhile tiny homes are attractive and novel, there are some design and logistical challenges. Rose says that it will take the combination of form, function and freedom for tiny to take off on a wider scale.\n\n\"You see these amazing tiny houses in magazines and on television programs, but you can't really buy them,\" says Rose. \"Architects did it for themselves to prove how they can make a gem. So we thought: Why don't we work with the world's best architects on this? And make them available to everyone.\"\n\nDavid Latimer, a tiny home designer and owner of New Frontier Tiny Homes in Nashville, says the challenges to wider acceptance of tiny homes is also procedural. Consumer financing and zoning regulations are holding the industry back, he says. \"Government and financing regulation changes move slower than molasses running up hill in Antarctica.\"\n\nBut with some design enhancements and evolutions in financing and zoning, the tipping point to a wider acceptance of tiny living may be coming.\n\nArchitect designed\n\nThe first architect that Klein asked to design a tiny house that could be mass-produced was Denmark's Bjarke Ingels. The A45 house he and his firm, Bjarke Ingels Group, designed is an enhanced A-frame style in a prismatic shape with a square footprint. If you imagine taking a cube and pushing two opposite corners down to the ground, that is the shape of the house. The shape gives the interior a more grandiose feel, with full 16-foot height on both sides of the structure.\n\nThe 150-square-foot home is a low-impact, off-the-grid structure made of wood, glass and canvas that can be carried into remote areas and constructed by hand.\n\n\"You can see it as a surf cottage on Montauk or tucked up in the mountains,\" says Rose.\n\nEvery room in my homes feels full size. A lot of natural light. Full size range. King size beds. Oven. Big sinks.\" David Latimer, CEO and founder of New Frontier Tiny Homes\n\nKlein is taking pre-orders for the home now, with anticipated delivery in the first quarter of 2019. The company's goal is to keep it under $100,000 for the full structure including interior finishes. (Permitting and clearing of the land are extra.)\n\nBut this house is only the first of six homes, each designed by a different architect and exploring a full circle of tiny home concepts.\n\nOne will be the biggest home that can be hauled by a semi-truck. Another will be a mobile tiny house. The company is even exploring a tiny home that can be taken down and put up again.\n\nThe next home Klein will introduce will be modular.\n\n\"There will be A, B and C modules and you can put them together in many possible ways,\" says Rose. \"It has the diversity to be everything from a music studio to an extra cottage to a bigger tiny home for a family. You can customize your home to your life.\"\n\nDownsize and upgrade\n\nMoving from a full-sized home to a tiny home can be an adjustment. No one wants to feel like they are living in \"less.\"\n\nThat's why Latimer intentionally designs his homes with full-sized fixtures and appliances, high-end finishes and the kind of craftsmanship you'd find in a custom home.\n\nThe full-sized kitchen, with king sized bed just beyond, in the Escher model tiny home from New Frontier Tiny Homes.\n\n\"Downsize and upgrade,\" says Latimer. \"Every room in my homes feels full size. A lot of natural light. Full-size range. King-size beds. Oven. Big sinks.\"\n\nThis is in keeping with the tiny home idea of scaling back and having more.\n\n\"The new status symbol is cultivating a life of experience,\" says Latimer. \"It is about experiences, not stuff. And small spaces allow us to do that. People are looking for smaller mortgages, smaller time lines. With more time and money for other things.\"\n\nEvolved zoning and financing\n\nA source of frustration for those who want to live tiny is a lack of easy paths to rezoning for tiny homes and access to consumer financing products.\n\nZoning laws are local and specific, making large-scale sales of these homes harder. In many places there are zoning laws that have minimum lot size requirements. This doesn't prohibit tiny homes, but makes them very expensive given the cost of land. Some communities prohibit additional structures on a property.\n\nIf the home is on wheels, a buyer cannot easily secure traditional financing.\n\nInside the Cornelia designed and built by New Frontier Tiny Homes.\n\nBut these regulations are evolving. Slowly.\n\nA newly updated building code relaxes certain requirements for tiny homes like the ceiling height and staircase specifications, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\n\"The future for residential housing has to change,\" says Latimer. \"It is an idea whose time has come.\"\n\nTiny houses on wheels will continue to have useful applications, but the increasing demand for mass market tiny homes on a foundation will help to grow an industry and a community-based movement, Latimer says.\n\n\"We're not talking about putting spaceships on land next to anyone's house,\" says Latimer. \"It is a home, it just a little smaller. The bar can be shifted from a governmental standpoint because this is an option people want.\"", "(CNN)-- \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0646\u064f\u0634\u0631\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \"\u0648\u0627\u0634\u0646\u0637\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u0633\u062a\" \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a \u0631\u062c\u0628 \u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0648\u063a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0642\u0629 \u0628\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u062d\u0641\u064a \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u062e\u0627\u0634\u0642\u062c\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0642\u062a\u0644\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u0621 \"\u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629\".\n\n\u0648\u0623\u0648\u0636\u062d \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0648\u063a\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0641\u0627\u062a\u0647\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0632\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u062b\u0629 \u062e\u0627\u0634\u0642\u062c\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0648\u0635\u0641\u0648\u0627 \u0642\u062a\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0647 \"\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0647\".\n\n\u0648\u0623\u0636\u0627\u0641 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0648\u063a\u0627\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0640\"\u0642\u062a\u0644 \u062e\u0627\u0634\u0642\u062c\u064a\"\u060c \u0645\u0636\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \"\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0642\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u0643\u0633 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0629\".", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

The law has existed in India since 1989.\n\nThe lower castes, also known as Dalits, one of the most marginalized groups in India's complicated caste system -- a community of people once known as the untouchables, who were often denied the right to education and employment through systemic discrimination and abuse.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - El actor Alec Baldwin fue arrestado el viernes por agresi\u00f3n, seg\u00fan la polic\u00eda de Nueva York.\n\nEl teniente John Grimpel de la polic\u00eda de Nueva York dijo a CNN que el incidente ocurri\u00f3 en la calle 10 en Manhattan, pero no dio detalles sobre las circunstancias.\n\nUn hombre de 49 a\u00f1os result\u00f3 con una herida en la mand\u00edbula tras ser golpeado y fue llevado a un hospital cercano, dijo la polic\u00eda.\n\nBaldwin se encuentra recluido, dijo Grimpel.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de representar al presidente Donald Trump en \"Saturday Night Live\", Baldwin actualmente presenta un programa de entrevistas dominical en ABC, llamado \"The Alec Baldwin Show\".\n\nUn representante de Baldwin a\u00fan no ha respondido a la solicitud de comentarios de CNN.", "Ana Navarro is a Republican strategist and CNN political commentator. Follow her on Twitter @ananavarro . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinions on CNN.\n\n(CNN) My Florida absentee ballot had been sitting on my kitchen counter unopened for more than two weeks. Every day, I avoided it as if it was a Zika-infected mosquito. I finally filled it out, and then I schlepped it in my bag for a few more days before putting it in the mail. I was giving myself a chance to change my mind. I wanted to delay the unavoidable.\n\nI am a lifelong Republican. Since I began voting, I have always voted for Republicans running in state races in Florida. This year, I filled out my ballot for Democrat Andrew Gillum. And on Thursday, I finally put it in the mail.\n\nRon DeSantis, a Republican, ran a primary campaign in which he portrayed himself as Donald Trump's Mini-Me. His signature issue during the primary was building a wall, which is weird because, well, Florida is not a border state. It's a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. Trump weighed in heavily in favor of DeSantis during the primary, who is now deeply in his debt..\n\nI don't want a Trump echo chamber for governor in Florida. I want a governor who puts the interest of the state above loyalty to a president of his party.\n\nBut I also did not want to vote for Gillum. I'm a centrist. He's a progressive. That word kind of scares me.\n\nHe wants to raise corporate taxes. I am against that. I think it would impede Florida's economic growth. There's an unresolved issue of an FBI investigation involving the city of Tallahassee while he was mayor.\n\nAnd then there are loyalty issues for me. My good friend Jeb Bush is supporting DeSantis. The man I'm about to marry, former Florida Republican Party Chairman Al Cardenas, is also supporting DeSantis. To say neither of them is a fan of Trump is an understatement. But they both think having a Republican governor, and avoiding gridlock in Tallahassee, supersedes the destructive influence of Trump. I disagree. Voting should not be group-think. We are all free to disagree with friends and even spouses (to be).\n\nThe 2016 election taught us all an important lesson. Some things in life are binary choices. There is too much at stake in these elections. Often in Florida, elections are decided by 1 percentage point or less. Need I remind you of the 2000 presidential election, which was decided by just over 500 votes in Florida? Writing in Mickey Mouse is not an option. Leaving it blank is not an option. Throwing away your vote, is not an option. We have to vote for one of the two candidates who can actually win.\n\nI hoped that after the primary, DeSantis would distance himself from Trump. But instead, he doubled down. The race has been tinged with accusations of racism against DeSantis from day one. DeSantis now says he supports Trump's latest proposal of ending birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship is granted by the 14th Amendment. Trump will be in Florida twice to headline rallies for DeSantis in the closing days of the campaign. These two are tied at the hip.\n\nJUST WATCHED Poll: Women powering Democrats' lead in Florida Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Poll: Women powering Democrats' lead in Florida 01:55\n\nRecent events have made voting for DeSantis that much more impossible. Cesar Sayoc , by all appearances a Trump sycophant, is accused of sending explosive devices through the mail, including three to my workplace, CNN. The sole perpetrator of these acts is the one who sent these explosives. But I believe, as do many other Americans, that Trump's divisive words contributed to triggering the alleged actions of an apparent madman.\n\nBoth Gillum and I have been personally attacked by Trump. Both Gillum and I were the targets of Twitter threats by Sayoc. Within hours of Sayoc's court arraignment, Trump was attacking Gillum, calling him a \"thief\" and claiming that if elected, he would \"turn Florida into Venezuela.\"\n\nThat last part really strikes a raw nerve for me. Like hundreds of thousands of other Floridians born in places such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, I fled a left-wing regime. Venezuela is ruled by a ruthless dictator who beats, jails and kills his political opponents. The inflation rate is just about at 1,000,000%. Under President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuelans lack even basic necessities such as food, toilet paper and medicine. To compare Gillum to Maduro is a scare tactic by a reckless demagogue. It cheapens the pain and trauma of the people of Venezuela. It is a bald-faced lie and impossibility.\n\nThe state Legislature in Florida is Republican. Barring political apocalypse, it will remain Republican. Unlike Washington for the past two years, in Florida there would be checks and balances. Any major proposal Gillum may want made into law would require Republican cooperation.\n\nPolitics in America have become so tribal, we need checks and balances. We need our co-equal branches of government retaining their independence. We do not need one becoming subservient to the other. That is why I'm splitting my vote and voting Republican for the state Cabinet and Legislature.\n\nJUST WATCHED Gillum responds to allegations of misused funds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gillum responds to allegations of misused funds 02:35\n\nUntil a few days ago, I had never met Gillum. Before the last debate, I spoke to him. We talked about policy and the controversy involving a couple of tickets to \"Hamilton.\" He agreed he should have been more vigilant about how the tickets got paid for. But folks, I voted for Rick Scott for governor, and I voted for Marco Rubio for US senator when they were both facing far more serious financial controversies. After talking to Gillum, I think he learned a lesson about the scrutiny and standards that come with public office. The higher the office, the higher the standard -- unless you are Donald Trump.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back for me was the racist, anti-immigration ad Trump posted on Twitter the same night he came to Florida to hold a rally. Trump won the 2016 campaign through a divide-and-conquer strategy. In his campaign announcement a year earlier, Trump said Mexicans were \"bringing crime, they're rapists.\" He has not stopped blowing dog whistles and fabricating culture wars since.\n\nHis response to Charlottesville, the Muslim ban, the National Anthem controversy ... the list is endless. It disgusts me that, not even a week after a madman who may have been triggered by the hysteria surrounding migrants killed 11 Jews in a house of worship in Pittsburgh, Trump is back to his old playbook of demonizing immigrants.\n\nFor more opinion...

I am sure that if he wins, I will have some policy differences with him. And when I do, I will say so.\n\nThe choice in Florida, and in many races across the United States, is clear. The 2018 election is a referendum on Trump and his attacks on our shared values, but more than that, it is a battle to define the heart and soul of America.\n\nDo we vote based on fear and angst and division? Or do we vote for an inspirational message of unity and a brighter future together. We each have a choice to make based on our own priorities.

Here's what you missed while recovering from your sugar intake.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent Halloween itself on the campaign trail, but when you're President, you can celebrate Halloween whenever you want . He and first lady Melania Trump welcomed ghosts and goblins to the White House over the weekend, and President Trump had a ton of fun with this prop.`\n\nOn actual Halloween, a group of children became naturalized American citizens.

No es de extra\u00f1ar que sus oponentes pol\u00edticos cayeran ante \u00e9l, mientras romp\u00eda la cuarta pared para narrar ansiosamente su desesperaci\u00f3n a la audiencia.\n\nSpacey, sin embargo, se ha ido tras unas acusaciones de mala conducta sexual. Esto hace m\u00e1s alto el foco en la esposa de Underwood, Claire, que aporta un poco m\u00e1s de sutileza al proceso de gobernar, pero no es menos h\u00e1bil al manipular a aquellos que la rodean.\n\nEso est\u00e1 bien, en la medida de lo posible, pero solo si los giros proporcionan suficiente resistencia para mejorar el drama subyacente. La nueva temporada de \u2018House of Cards\u2019 (de la que fueron previsualizados cinco de los ocho episodios antes de su estreno) le da a Claire antagonistas sacados de los titulares de prensa, como los multimillonarios hermanos Koch: interpretados por Greg Kinnear y Diane Lane. Aunque el poder de la estrella es impresionante, el juego que est\u00e1n jugando \u2014muy transparente\u2014 se siente un poco menos as\u00ed.\n\nLa b\u00fasqueda de una explicaci\u00f3n por la ausencia de Frank no se siente exactamente org\u00e1nica en la narrativa, pero le agrega un poco de diversi\u00f3n a la trama. Al menos, la historia trae varias posibilidades dram\u00e1ticas en juego, incluso aunque sea dif\u00edcil dejar escapar el sentimiento de que esto no hubiera sido as\u00ed si Spacey no hubiera tenido que salir de la manera en que sali\u00f3.\n\nM\u00e1s ampliamente, la serie siempre oper\u00f3 entre una versi\u00f3n exagerada de la pol\u00edtica, uniendo ecos de escenarios del mundo real (una exprimera dama que asciende a la Oficina Oval, rusos viles y miembros del gabinete rebeldes) con los espl\u00e9ndidos escenarios de una novela. Quiz\u00e1s es por eso que los presentadores de noticias y los expertos siguen ansiosos por aparecer en los cameos, incluso si la mayor\u00eda de ellos demuestra que son m\u00e1s adeptos en sus tareas diarias que en la actuaci\u00f3n.\n\nWright ciertamente proporciona una presencia dominante en el centro de la vor\u00e1gine demostrando, de nuevo, una mezcla de agallas y crueldad que hacen a Claire tan malvada como Frank. A\u00fan as\u00ed la situaci\u00f3n de Spacey no es el \u00fanico evento fuera de c\u00e1maras que se entrometi\u00f3 en las florecientes imaginaciones del show, con el gobierno de Trump habiendo hecho todo lo posible para que incluso los dramas pol\u00edticos m\u00e1s exagerados puedan competir por su dinero.\n\nComo una cuesti\u00f3n pr\u00e1ctica, es f\u00e1cil ver por qu\u00e9 aquellos asociados con \u2018House of Cards\u2019 quer\u00edan mantener la serie a flote, aunque solo fuera para proporcionarle a esta serie exclusiva \u2014que junto con \"Orange is the new Black\u201c, ayud\u00f3 a Netflix a tener un lugar en el mapa\u2014 un cierre satisfactorio.\n\nDicho esto, no se puede escapar a la incomodidad que rodea esta sexta y \u00faltima temporada, una inevitable consecuencia de tener que barajar las cartas, creativamente hablando, despu\u00e9s de descartar uno de sus ases.\n\nLa \u00faltima temporada de House of Cards sale se estrena el 2 de noviembre en

According to reporting by The Washington Post and The Sacramento Bee, it's also based on a series of falsehoods spun out to demonize the Democrats.\n\nThirty years ago, Lee Atwater, the campaign manager of then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's faltering presidential campaign, unleashed the infamous Willie Horton attack ad portraying Democratic presidential nominee and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis as a weak-on-crime liberal who allowed a black criminal to rape and assault a white couple while on a weekend furlough from prison.\n\nThe tactic proved brutally effective, smearing Democrats as purveyors of urban violence and chaos, stereotyping black men as dangerous criminals, and influencing all subsequent Democratic presidential nominees' stances on the death penalty and criminal justice policies -- which in turn helped produce our contemporary crisis of mass incarceration. The fallout from the ad proved to be a watershed, transforming the name of a once-obscure black man into a verb.\n\nFuture politicians all vowed never to let anyone \"Willie Horton\" them. In fact, candidate Bill Clinton so feared being \"Willie Hortoned\" four years later that he personally flew to Arkansas to oversee the death sentence of a black defendant to prove his bona fides to white voters who remained skeptical of the Democratic Party's ties to civil rights and racial justice advocacy.\n\nThe Republicans took the White House after the 1988 election at the cost of the party's anti-slavery roots. The once-proud party of Lincoln, having weathered the racial storms brought on by Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, could not survive the nakedly racist appeals of the Horton ad. Atwater's promise to turn Horton into Dukakis' running mate succeeded beyond his wildest dreams and long past his change of heart while stricken with terminal cancer and dying at the age of 40.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lemon: The biggest threats are home-grown Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lemon: The biggest threats are home-grown 06:46\n\nWillie Horton transformed American politics. Like a racist apparition rising from the fever dream of a Reconstruction-era racial segregationist, Horton played upon longstanding and historic racial fears and anxiety about black violence, criminality and sexuality. The image of Horton's scowling mug shot juxtaposed against a picture of Dukakis lent visual evidence to the era's criminalization of the entire black community.\n\nLess than a quarter of a century after the passage of major civil rights and voting rights legislation of the 1960s, the Horton ad also represented an assault on a rising black middle class and elites determined to gain their share of the American dream. Jesse Jackson's stirring presidential runs in the 1984 and 1988 Democratic primaries, where he garnered millions of votes in campaigns that anticipated the Obama coalition's political success, challenged the myth that the nation would never elect a black president.\n\nAtwater's tactics, once considered politically extreme by Republicans, have now become the standard political appeal for the GOP. Where past Republican presidents hid behind political consultants and campaign managers, Trump remains an unapologetic pied piper of racial division.\n\nJUST WATCHED Tapper: Crickets from GOP leaders on Trump ad Replay More Videos ...

We know the reason why he did it: It wins elections and helps him maintain his narcissistic grip on power.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nHow he did it represents a larger cautionary tale for our entire democratic system. Three decades ago forces in the GOP determined that they needed to expand the political strategy that ushered in the Nixon and Reagan administrations to maintain power. They did so at the cost of their own political souls and in the process opened up a racial Pandora's box that this nation has been struggling to close ever since.", "(CNN) Amal Hussein, a 7-year-old Yemeni girl whose photograph in The New York Times became a symbol of the country's long-running conflict, has died, Yemen's Houthi-held Health Ministry said.\n\nThe image by Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Tyler Hicks showed the emaciated girl lying on a bed October 18 at a mobile UNICEF clinic in Aslam, Yemen.\n\nThe stark photograph of such a young child in pain -- Hussain was suffering from severe acute malnutrition -- was emblematic of the brutal civil war that has pushed millions to the brink of starvation.\n\nHussein's mother, Mariam Ali, said her heart was \"broken,\" the Times reported Thursday.\n\n\"Amal was always smiling. Now I'm worried for my other children,\" she told the newspaper in a phone interview.

Cedric Richmond, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in an interview Friday that he's open to re-electing the current senior House Democratic leaders, tamping down talk of a battle for the top two positions if Democrats retake the House majority in next week's midterms.\n\nRichmond's comments came after he wrote a letter this week calling for a CBC member to be in the top leadership spots of the caucus.\n\n\"I'd like to reiterate that if there is any change in our top leadership positions, the Democratic members of the CBC endorse African-American representation in at least one of the top two positions of elected House Democratic Caucus Leadership,\" he wrote.\n\nThe letter raised questions about whether a CBC member would challenge Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi or Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, the top two Democratic leaders in the House.\n\nBut Richmond told CNN that he meant there should be an African-American lawmaker in the top two spots -- only if there's a vacancy that arises. That could mean that if Democrats take the majority next week, the influential CBC could potentially get behind a Democratic leadership team led by Pelosi as speaker and Hoyer as House majority leader and in the No. 3 spot, Rep. James Clyburn, who is black.\n\n\"It could be the same three,\" Richmond told CNN. \"I'm not ruling that out.\"\n\nAsked if he believed any CBC member would challenge either Pelosi or Hoyer to the position, Richmond said: \"I'm not hearing anything yet about a challenge to either.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Clyburn, who is the assistant Democratic leader, also threw cold water on talk of a challenge for the top, telling Politico:\n\n\"I do not expect there to be any change in the number one and number two spots,\" Clyburn said, referring to Pelosi and Hoyer. \"I will pursue the number three spot which I held before.\"\n\nClyburn served as House majority whip from 2006 to 2010.\n\nAsked if he supported Pelosi's bid to become speaker, Richmond said: \"I've always been a Nancy supporter.\"\n\nBut he said he has more questions about Pelosi's recent pitch that she would be a \"transitional\" leader, saying she needs to spell out her future plans to the caucus.\n\n\"Now that she's introduced 'transitional,' what does that mean?\" Richmond said.\n\nRichmond's comments are the latest sign that Democrats are eager to avoid a messy succession if they do take the majority. While a number of Democratic candidates have said they would not support Pelosi for speaker, she is the heavy favorite to reclaim the gavel in part because there's no serious opposition to her. The only way a vacancy would arise would be if she fails to get the necessary 218 votes to become speaker on the floor -- and the chances of that occurring increase if Democrats win only a tiny majority on Tuesday.\n\nRichmond said that it's time for an African-American member to be one of the top two leaders \"after 233 years,\" and he defended the efforts by CBC members to help win the Democratic majority on Tuesday.\n\n\"If we're going to have a leadership change, then we need to have an African-American member in one of the top two spots,\" Richmond said.\n\nJeffries, others eye leadership role\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, another member of the Congressional Black Caucus, is exploring a bid for the top leadership ranks and has been meeting with colleagues to discuss his interest, according to a Democratic source.\n\nThe New York Democrat has not specifically stated which position he's eying.\n\nLike Clyburn, his allies privately make the case he could also be the first African-American speaker and argue his dynamic style and rhetoric could make him a formidable attack dog against President Donald Trump.\n\nJeffries' interest has caused some tension in the CBC, as Richmond and others have been pushing for Clyburn to become speaker one day. In his letter Thursday, Richmond only praised the work of one CBC member by name: Clyburn.\n\nJeffries, 48, has only been in Congress for three terms, but he's quickly built a large profile for himself through the media and through his relationships across the caucus, including some Republicans both on the Hill and off, such as Jared Kushner while working on criminal justice reform.\n\nA co-chairman of the House Democratic Policy & Communications Committee, which comes up with messaging for the caucus, Jeffries has already worked closely with the highest ranks of leadership. While he's viewed as progressive and part of the progressive caucus, he's also a pragmatist who doesn't espouse all views of his far left colleagues.\n\nSome members in the Democratic caucus have also raised Rep. Karen Bass, another CBC member, as a potential speaker someday. Bass was formerly the speaker of the California state assembly and the first African-American woman in history to lead a state legislative chamber.\n\nAt the time she went toe-to-toe with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a celebrity-turned-politician. It's a fact her allies like to bring up given the current environment in Washington, where another celebrity sits in the executive chair.\n\nSo far, there are no clear signs that Bass is angling for the position anytime soon.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Barbara Lee, who's also a part of the CBC, is running for Democratic caucus chair, the No. 4 position in the caucus.", "Mark Harris, a former pastor who stepped down from his congregation in 2017, is the GOP nominee in North Carolina's 9th District, which runs along the state's southern border below Charlotte and Fayetteville. Harris defeated three-term GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger in a May primary and is now facing Democrat Dan McCready. CNN rates the race toss-up, the most competitive designation.\n\nHarris, as the senior pastor of Charlotte's First Baptist Church, claimed Islam was \"dangerous\" and the work of Satan. He also said peace between Israel and the Palestinians could not be achieved until Muslims and Jews accepted Jesus Christ as their savior.\n\nDuring one sermon, Harris showed his congregation a conspiratorial video claiming that Islam was taking over the world, including the United States. Harris said in that 2014 sermon that he was \"shocked\" and that \"what he showed presented some cold hard facts that need to be exposed. And I mean, need to be exposed quickly.\"\n\nThe video, which was posted on YouTube in 2009 and which the online fact-checking site Snopes called \"Mostly False,\" alleges that European and American cultures are in terminal decline due to a coincidence of decreasing fertility rates and booming population growth among Muslim immigrants. \"As the population shrinks, so does the culture,\" the narrator states.\n\nThe narrator later adds, \"In a matter of years, Europe as we know it will cease to exist.\"\n\nOver Middle Eastern-sounding music, the video goes on to cite dubious statistics on various European countries, including the assertion that the average Muslim family in France has 8.1 children to the average non-Muslim family's 1.8. \"In just 39 years, France will be an Islamic republic,\" the video claims.\n\nPew research published in 2017 showed that while Muslim women in Europe do have more children than non-Muslim women, the difference was projected to be between 2.6 to 1.6 and 2.9 to 1.9 in France specifically. The research suggested that the Muslim portion of the European population is expected to increase over coming decades, although the data does not support the sweeping claims made in the video.\n\nThe video goes on to warn of a similar pattern in the United States before claiming that Islamic organizations had met \"three years ago\" in Chicago to plan \"to evangelize America through journalism, politics, education, and more.\" It's unclear what meeting is being referenced in the video.\n\n\"If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?\" Harris asked the congregation after the end of the video.\n\nA spokesperson for Harris' campaign did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn another sermon, in November 2010 , Harris called Islam dangerous and a counterfeit of Christianity.\n\n\"There is a satanic trinity of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. Satan is always a counterfeit,\" Harris said. \"Listen to me, that is why the religion of Islam is so dangerous. It is the great counterfeit of our generation.\"\n\nHarris went on to say that many elements of the Koran are identical to passages from the Bible, and warned against listening to political leaders who call Islam one of the great religions of the world.\n\n\"It is the great counterfeit. That's why we've got to be so careful of political leaders who somehow just like to speak of it as one of the great world religions. Ladies and gentlemen, it is not,\" he said. \"In right here in Revelation 13, can't you see where we're moving? Because in Revelation 13 there is a counterfeit death and there is a counterfeit resurrection.\"\n\nIn another November 2010 sermon, Harris played on a similar theme, saying that in countries under Islamic rule, people are given no choice but to \"worship the anti-Christ\" and \"to bow down to the image of the Beast.\"\n\n\"If you reject Jesus and you go into the great tribulation that we're describing in Revelation 13, the Devil's not going to give you that choice,\" he said. \"You're going to be forced to worship the anti-Christ. You're going to be forced to bow down to the image of the Beast. And you know as well as I do in some countries of the world this very morning under Islamic rule, men are given no choice, but God's given you a choice this very morning.\"\n\nIn 2011 , Harris delivered a sermon in which he recalled a recent trip he took to Israel and noted the tension that existed between Palestinians and Israelis. He went on to say there would be no peace between Jews and Muslims until they converted to Christianity.\n\n\"You cannot be in that land, as powerful and as moving as it is, without realizing the incredible tension that is constantly in that land between the Palestinians and the Jews,\" Harris said. \"There will never be peace in Jerusalem until the day comes that every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.\"\n\nHarris continued to say that no inhabitants of Jerusalem -- whether they be Jewish, Muslim, or Christians without a personal relationship with Jesus -- would experience peace until they accepted the teachings of Jesus.\n\n\"Jesus, when he went into Jerusalem, said, 'I am the vine. I am the true vine,' and until those that are called in Islam realize that and until those that are called in Judaism realize that, for that matter, until those that are caught in the religion of Christianity and are missing the personal relationship with Jesus Christ, realize that, there'll never be peace in their soul or peace in their city.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n\"Creo que hay una suposici\u00f3n de que estas son m\u00e1s seguras que las sopas que salen de una estufa\", dice una doctora\n\nLas sopas instant\u00e1neas tienen la culpa de casi 10.000 quemaduras pedi\u00e1tricas en los Estados Unidos cada a\u00f1o\n\n(CNN) - La sopa instant\u00e1nea, a menudo vendida como \"ramen\" en los Estados Unidos, es barata, sabrosa y muy popular entre los estudiantes universitarios hambrientos.

growth ended years ago. Now Apple is making a change to ensure it doesn't have to talk as much about that problem.\n\nOn a conference call Thursday, top Apple executives laid out their plans to stop disclosing the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells each quarter. It's a move that shocked analysts and only added to jitters around a mixed earnings report\n\nDaniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called the announcement a \"jaw dropper\" in an investor note Friday morning, particularly because Apple is at a \"critical juncture.\" He said Apple is trying to make up for slowing unit sales growth by charging more for its lineup of devices.\n\nSure enough, in the three month period ending in September, Apple sold just shy of 47 million iPhones, representing 0% growth in the number of smartphones sold from the prior year. In future quarters, the number of iPhones Apple sells could decline -- but we probably won't know about it.\n\nApple's Mac and iPad unit sales fell by 2% and 6%, respectively, during the quarter compared to a year ago.\n\nYet Apple's overall revenue continues to climb from one year to the next. That's in large part because the company is hiking prices across the board. Apple made $8 billion more dollars selling iPhones than it did a year earlier (when it sold almost the exact same number of iPhones).\n\nApple now has not one but two smartphones on the market -- the XS and XS Max -- with price tags that can exceed $1,000. Apple also recently introduced more expensive iPad Pros and MacBook Airs.\n\nOn the call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook tried to explain the decision to do away with unit sales figures by way of a grocery store analogy.\n\n\"If you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says, or he says, 'How many units you have in there?' It doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.\"\n\nWhat matters now, in other words, isn't necessarily how many devices Apple sells from one quarter to the next, but how much it makes from the devices sells. That's a tough pill to swallow for Wall Street.\n\n\"The elimination of reporting unit metrics for iPhone, iPad, and Mac is significant \u2014 the Street obsesses over them,\" Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures, wrote in a note Friday.\n\nMore than that, the decision once again raises concerns about what the next big driver of growth will be for the world's largest company. Apple has never disclosed unit sales for the Apple Watch, its most recent new hardware category. And despite years of rumors about an Apple Car, there is still nothing on the horizon.\n\nThat leaves its existing slate of hardware products. Investors, and price-conscious consumers alike, will both wonder how much more Apple can charge for future iPhones and iPads to keep sales growth humming along. Will people pay $2,000 for an iPhone?\n\nInstead, Apple continues to try to focus investors on the strong sales growth for supplementary services, including Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. In the most recent quarter, Apple said sales for this category hit nearly $10 billion, an all-time high and larger than most standalone businesses in the world.\n\n\"The new reporting methodology is Apple's attempt to get investors to think of their entire business as a service,\" Munster says. But, he admits it could take a year for investors to embrace it.\n\nBut even the success of subscription services ultimately depend on getting customers to keep flocking to the Apple devices that support these services, with the iPhone chief among them.\n\nAt some point Apple will need to figure out what will replace the iPhone, or its growth engine could stall out.", "(CNN) For months now, the US economy has been roaring. The latest evidence? The October jobs report -- 250,000 jobs added, 3.7% unemployment rate and wage growth at 3.1%.\n\nTraditionally, a booming economy accrues to the benefit of the president -- putting him and his party in prime position for electoral gains, especially this close to an election.\n\nBut President Donald Trump is anything but traditional. And even as the economy has soared, his job approval numbers have stayed stagnant -- and low. In the latest Gallup weekly tracking poll , just 40% of Americans approved of the job he was doing while 54% disapproved. An NPR/PBS/Marist poll released earlier this week showed similar numbers, with Trump's job approval at 41%.\n\nAnd, as Gallup's Jeffrey M. Jones noted in a recent analysis on the midterms : \"55% of Americans rate current economic conditions as excellent or good and 12% as poor, for a net rating of +43. That is far better than the average net rating of +10 since 1994 and better than in all recent midterms except 1998.\" (WaPo's Philip Bump has a terrific analysis of this data -- and Trump -- here.)\n\nYet, with just four days left before the 2018 midterms, conventional wisdom is that Republicans will lose the House majority they've held since 2010 and will narrowly hold onto their Senate majority, despite defending just nine seats to Democrats' 26. The GOP is also poised to suffer significant losses at the gubernatorial level.\n\nSo, what gives? Why isn't Trump's party in better shape given the stellar state of the economy?\n\nThe answer to both of those questions is simple: Trump. Or, more specifically, that outside of his hardcore base, people just don't like him.\n\nAgain, Gallup's Jones:\n\n\"The President's current job approval rating of 41% from the October 15-28 poll is well below the 52% average in midterm elections since 1974 and is one of the lowest for a president prior to a midterm election over that time. Trump's approval rating in the most recent week of Gallup tracking is similar, at 40%.\"\n\nUnlike past presidents, Trump is simply not getting the credit for what is broadly acknowledged as a very strong economy. And the reason is almost certainly because people do not like him or approve of him personally.\n\nHere's a data point to back that claim up. Usually a president's personal favorable ratings are significantly higher than his job approval ratings. The reason is simple: People may dislike a president's policies but they tend to admire or at least respect him as a person, or husband and father. So they are far more likely to say they view him personally in a more favorable light while disapproving of the job he is doing.\n\nWith Trump, there's none of that. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Trump's job approval is at 44% while his personal favorability is 42% . There's just no difference between people who think he is doing a good job and people who like him. The opinions are one and the same.\n\nConsider this (admittedly extreme) scenario: Trump is elected. He employs the exact same policies -- on trade, on regulations etc. -- that he has over his first two years in office. But he simply never appears in public. Never. He never tweets. Never.\n\nSure, there would be stories about our hermit President. People would wonder if something had happened to him. But it's hard for me to believe that if Trump had followed that plan, his party would not be in better shape to break historical trends against the party in power for midterm elections right now.\n\nOf course, Donald Trump being Donald Trump, he could and would never play such a low-profile role. But given what we know about how presidential approval almost always moves in sync with economic satisfaction and optimism, it's hard to see Trump's lagging job approval ratings as anything but referendum not on his policies, but on him.\n\nWhich could make for a very interesting post-election period for Republicans if they wind up suffering -- as expected -- significant losses in the House. Political defeats -- and those defeated -- are always in search of scapegoats, and given the numbers I laid out above, the most obvious person to blame is the President of the United States.\n\nBUT Trump has already made clear he isn't planning to accept any of the blame if Republicans lose the House or suffer other setbacks in four days' time. \"I think I'm helping people,\" the President told the Associated Press in mid-October about whether he would accept blame. \"They would say that in the old days that if you got the support of a President or if you've got the support of somebody it would be nice to have, but it meant nothing, zero. Like literally zero. Some of the people I've endorsed have gone up 40 and 50 points just on the endorsement.\"\n\nIn short: If Republicans lose on Tuesday, look out. It's a defeat that should fall at Trump's feet. Everyone knows that except, well, Trump.", "(CNN) There's plenty of big-name talent in \"Boy Erased,\" including the Australian triumvirate of Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe and director-writer-co-star Joel Edgerton. The film, however -- based on Garrard Conley's memoir about his experience with gay-conversion therapy -- largely belongs to Lucas Hedges, in a movie that doesn't oversell its message in exposing the damage such intolerance can inflict.\n\nHedges plays Jared (yes, the name has been slightly changed), the son of an Arkansas minister (Crowe) who, after enrolling in college, must come to grips with the fact that he's gay.\n\nExposed through an unexpected series of events, Jared's dad enlists the guidance of \"wiser\" men, which leads to the youth being shipped off to a day camp that -- the smiling faces notwithstanding -- has the uncomfortable feel of a prison, with those facing the indoctrination program adopting different strategies to survive.\n\nGoing along for the ride, meanwhile, is Jared's mom (Kidman), a woman raised to defer to her husband in such matters, yet who must balance her growing unease with her love for her son.\n\nEdgerton -- who previously directed the 2015 thriller \"The Gift\" -- brings tremendous sensitivity and quiet strength to those scenes in particular. \"Boy Erased\" is similarly understated regarding its core issues, letting the audience see how much these young people -- raised by devout church-going families -- wouldn't \"choose\" this path, giving the lie to their instructor's admonition that they are somehow rebelling by being gay -- rooted in anger, disappointment or some other childhood trauma to be identified and overcome.\n\nRead More", "Esta fue la primera y \u00fanica toma guerrillera de las FARC a una ciudad capital en Colombia\n\nLa toma de Mit\u00fa dur\u00f3 72 horas, en las que 1.500 guerrilleros se enfrentaron a un pu\u00f1ado de polic\u00edas\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El 1 de noviembre de 1998, un batall\u00f3n de guerrilleros de las FARC se tomaron por primera vez en su historia de una ciudad capital de Colombia. Ese d\u00eda, en horas de la madrugada, una masacre propia de un conflicto degradado dej\u00f3 decenas de muertos y secuestrados. Esa madrugada, un pu\u00f1ado de polic\u00edas contuvieron uno de los ataques guerrilleros m\u00e1s violentos de la historia de Colombia.\n\nEste jueves se rindi\u00f3 un homenaje a las v\u00edctimas de este oscuro cap\u00edtulo de la historia colombiana. En Mit\u00fa, Vaup\u00e9s, departamento fronterizo con Brasil en el suroriente de Colombia, a\u00fan se recuerda la masacre que perpetraron las FARC y veinte a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s las heridas de esta toma guerrillera a\u00fan permanecen en la memoria de los colombianos.\n\nEl ataque guerrillero de ese 1 de noviembre era inminente. Desde d\u00edas antes hab\u00eda empezado a circular el rumor de que la guerrilla se estaba alistando y reuniendo comida, seg\u00fan recoge el Centro Nacional de Memoria Hist\u00f3rica (CNMH) a prop\u00f3sito de la conmemoraci\u00f3n del vig\u00e9simo aniversario de la toma.\n\nEra la madrugada del 1 de noviembre de 1998, y 1.500 guerrilleros del Bloque Oriental pusieron en marcha la llamada Operaci\u00f3n Marquetalia, en plena capital del departamento de Vaup\u00e9s, que hoy, 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, tiene una poblaci\u00f3n de 25.000 habitantes. Los guerrilleros atacaron la estaci\u00f3n de Polic\u00eda que apenas contaba con unos cuantos uniformados armados, 70 a lo sumo, 11 de ellos Polic\u00edas, seg\u00fan el CNMH.\n\n\u201cSe inform\u00f3 a Bogot\u00e1, a Villavicencio, a la VII Brigada y a los mandos superiores, que solo ten\u00edamos cerca de 70 hombres en armas entre oficiales, suboficiales, patrulleros y agentes de la Polic\u00eda. Tambi\u00e9n ten\u00edamos 30 bachilleres, pero ellos no hab\u00edan recibido instrucci\u00f3n militar\u201d, record\u00f3 el sargento mayor C\u00e9sar Augusto Lasso, uno de los polic\u00edas que contuvo el ataque y que fue secuestrado en la toma guerrillera, citado por el CNMH.\n\nArmados con cilindros en sus espaldas, los guerrilleros llegaron a zona urbana de Mit\u00fa, como si llegaran a uno de sus campamentos. El ataque empez\u00f3 en plena madrugada, cuando los pobladores a\u00fan dorm\u00edan, y se desat\u00f3 el infierno: los guerrilleros lanzaron granadas y cilindros bomba contra la estaci\u00f3n de la Polic\u00eda, mientras los escasos uniformados que se enfrentaban a un ej\u00e9rcito de 1.500, resist\u00edan el ataque con las pocas armas que ten\u00edan. La toma guerrillera se extendi\u00f3 por 72 horas.\n\n\u201cNos defendimos hasta que nos vimos copados\u201d, recuerda Lasso, que dur\u00f3 12 a\u00f1os, nueve meses y dos d\u00edas secuestrado, siendo uno de los colombianos que m\u00e1s tiempo pas\u00f3 en cautiverio. Lasso fue liberado el 2 de abril de 2012, junto con cuatro militares y cinco polic\u00edas que estaban secuestrados por las FARC. \u201cNo recuerdo cu\u00e1ntas horas nos defendimos\u201d, a\u00f1ade el polic\u00eda retirado.\n\nLas im\u00e1genes de la toma son desgarradoras: una ciudad totalmente destruida.

Podcasts are also fueling the hate.\n\nPodcasts were once relegated to nichecorners of the web, but the format has become much more mainstream in recent years. An estimated 73 million people in the United States tune into a podcast every month, according to Edison Research and Triton Digital.\n\nExtremists, spouting racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, and anti-immigrant beliefs, have followed the trend and are broadcasting their messages as established social media outlets crack down on similar content.\n\nTake LoveStreet, previously known as HateHouse. An episode labeled \"HateHouse EP 18: Black people are disabled,\" was posted on YouTube nine months ago. Just a few minutes in, one of the speakers says: \"Black people look very suspect and they fit the profile for a lot of crimes committed\" and \"Police know that n****s are violent all the time.\" It was removed on Friday after CNN Business flagged the video.\n\nAccording to a report released in October by the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, podcasting \"plays a particularly outsized role in spreading alt-right messages to the world\" in 2018. The ADL classifies the alt-right as having a white supremacist ideology combined with several other online subcultures including resentment of women known as \"manosphere,\" as well as engaging in right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nPodcasts are one of the most understudied platforms, yet they affect political discourse in big ways, said Alice Marwick, an expert in extremism and an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There's a sense of immediacy and authenticity with podcasts, she said.\n\nThey're often unscripted, lengthy, and have the ability to \"manufacture consensus,\" said Marwick, who is also an adviser at the research institute Data & Society. \"Podcasts can add legitimacy to extremist beliefs through repetition and reinforcement.\"\n\nHate speech is harder to pinpoint because audio podcasts are not cataloged by the internet the same way as text, which makes them more difficult to search and to moderate.\n\nPodcasts also spread in myriad ways.\n\nYouTube users often upload podcasts or talk show audio programs to the platform. YouTube's hate speech policy prohibits content that promotes or condones violence based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation, or content that has the purpose of inciting hatred based on those characteristics. But the company has long struggled with policing extremist content\n\nHateHouse is just one of the podcasts mentioned in the ADL's report. It's also available on podcasting platform PlayerFM and PodBean. PlayerFM, which does not post public policies on hate speech, defines itself as a search portal for podcasts, much like a Google search. It does not host podcasts, but disseminates them.\n\n\"You are free to access what you're interested in and not access the ones you're not. We do carry out moderation of content, for instance, we take down pornographic feeds,\" said a PlayerFM spokesperson. For other controversial topics, the spokesperson said it may conduct an evaluation, such as looking at its availability on other podcast directories. Other decision-making processes are unclear.\n\nAnother podcast platform called Spreaker has a policy that users may not \"publish any content that promotes, either directly or indirectly, hate, racism, discrimination, pornography, violence.\" But a search for \"Alt Right\" turns up episodes from Third Rail podcast, where racism and anti-Semitism abound.\n\nIn one episode of Third Rail, labeled as an \"ovenside chat,\" a guest mentioned the 2014 fatal shooting of black teen Michael Brown at the hands of a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. (\"Ovenside\" is an anti-Semitic twist on Franklin Delano Roosevelt's \"Fireside chats\" that is used by several alt-right platforms in reference to the Holocaust.)\n\n\"Black lives do matter,\" the guest said. \"Maybe they shouldn't be getting killed so much \u2014 but they do this to themselves. Try not committing crime, it's worked for me my entire life.\"\n\nSpreaker did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne of the most popular alt-right podcasts, according to the ADL report, is the The Daily Shoah, created by Mike Peinovich and published on his website, The Right Stuff. The podcast -- hosted on another podcasting platform called Libsyn -- is peppered with anti-Semitic and white nationalist remarks, including: \"We will shut their lying Jew mouths,\" \"I don't need foreigners with high IQs in my country. That's some bullsh*t\" and \"I want every day back for white normal people. That's what I'm fighting for.\"\n\nLibsyn did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEpisodes are also easily found on YouTube and PodBean under its acronym \"TDS.\" Peinovich originally hosted The Daily Shoah under a pseudonym, but his identity was revealed in 2017.\n\nYouTube has removed two podcast episodes of The Daily Shoah due to copyright claims. Other extremist podcast episodes flagged by CNN Business remain on YouTube, although some now have offensive content warnings.\n\n\"Content of any type that promotes violence or includes hate speech is prohibited on YouTube. We carefully review the videos flagged by our users and remove content that violates our Community Guidelines,\" a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. The company also said it's training new tech to help flag more hate speech, and its systems are improving.\n\nWhen reached for comment, PodBean said that while it is not the original host of the podcast, the podcaster submitted The Daily Shoah to Podbean for others to stream. After being alerted to its content by CNN Business, PodBean said, \"We have removed it from Podbean directory.\"\n\nAnother popular podcast and video brand, Red Ice TV calls itself \"truly independent alt-media.\" The Swedish brand has more than 250,000 subscribers on YouTube. In one radio episode, the speakers mention Somalian pirates and the 2013 film Captain Phillips about the 2009 hijacking of a US container ship by Somali pirates. \"From everything I've noticed, you guys have a tendency to be bad. Why would you import that?\" says one speaker, referring to Somalian people.\n\nSocial media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, have cracked down on threatening speech by kicking off some extremists in a move called de-platforming.\n\nMarwick says this tactic is important, because posting content on more mainstream places helps those with white nationalist, anti-Semitic and homophobic ideas recruit others and direct them to other platforms to consume their message. By de-platforming, it's harder to spread that content.\n\nInfoWars founder Alex Jones has been kicked off sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Spotify for violating their policies like rules around hate speech, although Spreaker makes available some InfoWars podcasts.\n\nExtremists and their followers are still using some social platforms to relay information to each other and create fans.\n\nPeinovich, for example, is an active Twitter user. His feed consists of white nationalist commentary and tweets that include statements such as \"the left wants all white people dead and openly says so with regularity.\"\n\n\"The goal is to post content on the more mainstream platforms and reel them in,\" said Marwick.\n\nBy piquing curiosity on Twitter, users may seek out more information about a person and stumble upon their podcasts, Marwick added.\n\nMark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism who worked on the report, told CNN Business that where technology advances, the extremists follow.\n\n\"Podcasting is one of the main ways the alt-right is getting its message out to its own members,\" said Pitcavage, noting that platforms may not be sufficiently aware of the issue yet.\n\nA Reddit post earlier this year asks, \"What are the best Alt-Right podcasts?\"\n\n\"There's just so many of them and I don't really know where to start,\" the user said when asking for recommendations.", "London (CNN Business) Silicon Valley startups are still taking Saudi cash despite the intense controversy over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi .\n\nTwo deals made public this week show that SoftBank ( SFTBF ) is pressing ahead with investments by its Vision Fund, a major player in Silicon Valley that is backed by $45 billion in Saudi government money.\n\nView, a startup that makes smart energy-saving windows, said Friday that it has received $1.1 billion from the Vision Fund.\n\nThe investment was announced one day after Zume, a tech firm that uses robots to make pizza, said in a regulatory filing that it received $375 million in new funding on October 17.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , that money also came from the $93 billion Vision Fund. Zume did not respond to questions from CNN Business about the source of the investment.\n\nThe cash infusions are the first big moves by the Vision Fund since the Khashoggi's killing raised questions over SoftBank's relationship with the government of Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia first denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's murder in its consulate in Istanbul before arguing that a group of rogue operators were responsible. The Saudi attorney general later acknowledged that he was killed in a premeditated murder.\n\nSoftBank founder Masayoshi Son stayed away from a major investment summit in Saudi Arabia that was overshadowed by the killing, despite his company being a key player in showcase projects designed to transform the country's economy\n\nSome tech titans have distanced themselves from Saudi Arabia.\n\nTesla ( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk has said he wouldn't accept an investment from the country's sovereign wealth fund because of the murder. His statement comes just weeks after he raised the possibility of taking Tesla private with Saudi cash.\n\nA major global tech player\n\nData from Dealogic shows the Vision Fund has pumped billions into tech startups around the world.\n\nLast year, it invested $4.4 billion in WeWork, the startup that has set up popular co-working spaces in cities across the globe. Slack, DoorDash and Improbable Worlds are among other startups that have received Vision Fund cash.\n\nZume and View fit right into the fund's portfolio of ambitious tech startups.\n\nZume wants to use technology to advance automation in the food industry. It deploys robots alongside humans to speed up the cooking process, and operates delivery trucks with ovens programmed to make pies en route to customers.\n\nA robot places a pizza into an oven at Zume.\n\nView manufacturers smart windows that can be controlled remotely via the internet. It says the glass lets in the optimum amount of natural light, reduces heat and glare, and cuts building energy consumption by up to 20%.\n\n\"We are excited to have this strong endorsement of our vision from SoftBank, a firm widely recognized for supporting category creating companies,\" CEO Rao Mulpuri said in a statement.\n\nBoth companies did not respond to questions on Friday about whether they were concerned about the source of the new investment funds.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nNota del editor: Carlos Alberto Montaner es escritor y analista pol\u00edtico de CNN.

E-bikes are pedal bikes that also have a small battery pack and an electric motor. As a rider pedals, the electric motor provides additional power. Some e-bikes can run on electricity alone with no pedaling. GM would not say whether its new bikes would require pedaling\n\n\"You get on the bike and you feel like you have the wind at your back in both directions,\" said Jennifer Cathcart, e-bike marketing manager at GM.\n\nGeneral Motors new electric bikes have no name, yet. Potential customers are being asked to provide ideas.\n\nThe bikes, including their electric motors, were developed by GM with assistance from engineers who worked on the automaker's electric cars, such as the Chevrolet Bolt EV.\n\nThe two new bikes, one of which is foldable, are designed with urban use in mind. Because they require less exertion to ride, e-bikes do away with some common objections to bike riding. In particular, riders won't have to work up a sweat on their way to work, even when riding uphill, Cathcart said. The bikes will include built-in front and back lights, GM said.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) Black Friday is just three weeks away. But will it turn out to be a bleak Friday for big consumer companies?\n\nApple ( AAPL ) warned late Thursday that its holiday sales will be lower than expected. The news comes one week after Amazon ( AMZN ) issued a tepid forecast for the fourth quarter as well.\n\nBoth companies have been notoriously cautious with their guidance in the past. They may be merely setting the bar low in the hopes they will be able to easily surpass their targets -- and ultimately be rewarded by Wall Street for doing so.\n\nSome experts are still predicting a holiday shopping bonanza this year, particularly for mobile and e-commerce retailers.\n\nSoftware giant Adobe ( ADBE ) released its annual online holiday shopping forecast Thursday and it predicted that digital sales will be up nearly 15% from a year ago to a record $124.1 billion during the holidays.\n\nAnd the National Retail Federation expects overall retail sales -- which includes brick and mortar stores -- will be up between 4.3 and 4.8 percent compared to last year, a growth rate slightly higher than the average spending gains during the past few years.\n\nStill, a look at other recent earnings reports from consumer gadget companies, retailers and restaurants show a somewhat disturbing trend: Apple and Amazon aren't the only ones that have surprised investors with less-than-stellar outlooks.\n\nStruggling action camera maker GoPro ( GPRO ), hamburger chain Shake Shack ( SHAK ) and video game leader Electronic Arts ( EA ) all cut forecasts.\n\nCruise line operator Royal Caribbean ( RCL ), hotel chain owner Hilton ( HLT ) and theme park operator Six Flags ( SIX ) did as well, suggesting that consumers may be starting to pull back on travel.\n\nToymaker Hasbro ( HAS ) posted disappointing results for the third quarter too, and there are worries about how both it and rival Mattel ( MAT ) will fare this Christmas following the closing of Toys \"R\" Us.\n\nOf course, there are always winners and losers in the retail and consumer landscape.

The fund already had purchased nearly 5% of Tesla shares on the open market, and fund officials urged Musk to accept an additional investment to take the company private.\n\nMusk said in a later blog post that he left that meeting \"with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving.\" A week later he shook Wall Street by announcing in a tweet plans to take Tesla private . He dropped those plans within a few weeks.\n\nMusk told Recode the Saudis may have sold their stake in the company since those discussions. Investors only have to disclose the extent of their holdings if they own 5% or more of the stock.

Claire McCaskill.\n\nAs has been the case of late, Trump's speech was peppered with a series of false claims -- primarily focused on the group of migrants making their way across Mexico at the moment -- and reliable applause lines about Democrats pushing for open border and socialism. Below, the 46 lines that stood out to me.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n1. \"I see these signs all over place, 'Tigers for Trump.' I like that.\"\n\n2. \"She'll never vote. She'll never vote. She never has, and she didn't even vote for Justice Kavanaugh.\"\n\nTrump's not wrong about this. McCaskill did vote against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Of course, so did every other Senate Democrat other than Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\n3. \"More Americans are working now than any time in history.\"\n\nThis is also true! But as I've noted many, many times before, there are simply more Americans than at any previous time in American history. So it makes sense that there are also more Americans working.\n\n4. \"So today, right now, we have more Americans working than at any time, any time in the history of our country. That's pretty good. That's pretty good.\"\n\nIt is good. But Trump taking credit for it is sort of like taking credit for the sun rising. Like, it's good that it happened, but he didn't, you know, do it.\n\n5. \"That'll be a very good sound bite in the debate when we face one of those Democrats, whoever it may be.\"\n\nWhat's remarkable about Trump is not that he's always making political calculations, but how willing he is to air those calculations publicly. More people than ever before is good because it will make a good sound bite against a Democrat in the 2020 presidential race.\n\n6. \"So we've done in less than two years what any other president or administration did in four years, in eight years, or, in one case, in more than eight years.\"\n\nIt's very, very hard to quantify Trump's claim here for the sake of comparison to past presidents. Even if you isolate just Trump's oft-repeated boast that he has cut more regulations than any past president, The Washington Post Fact Checker noted that it's virtually impossible to decide whether that's true or not.\n\n7. \"Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10% tax cut for the middle class.\"\n\nTrump initially suggested that the 10% tax cut was coming before the election, which was always ridiculous. ( Trump admitted as much earlier this week .) And the only way another tax cut is coming is if Republicans hold the House in four days' time, which doesn't seem terribly likely.\n\n8. \"The Democrat agenda is the agenda of the extreme far left. They've gone crazy, folks. They've gone totally loco.\"\n\nNot just crazy. Totally loco!!!\n\n9. \"You can't have dinner. You can't have dinner. Do you see what they're doing to our people?\"\n\nIt took me a few reads but I realized that Trump is referencing to liberal activists harassing people like Mitch McConnell or Sarah Sanders when they are out to dinner. Which is, without question, something that has conservatives up in arms.\n\n10. \"And we're being so nice. We're being so nice. And let's stay being nice, right? We'll stay being nice. Because we are tough as hell. We -- we're going to stay nice.\"\n\nSo, wait. Are we being nice? Or tough as hell? Can we be both?\n\n11. \"Don't forget: We've got the police. Law enforcement loves us.\"\n\nOminous!\n\n12. \"I said to the police the other day, we're so high in the polls, we're trying to figure out who is representing the other side? We don't even know. We want to figure it out.\"\n\nI genuinely have no idea what he is talking about here. Truly.\n\n13. \"The vets are for us. The veterans are all for us.\"\n\nAll veterans? This feels like it might not be entirely true.\n\n14. \"We don't run around like Antifa with their little arms and then go home back home into mommy's basement and put on the black uniform and the black helmet. Oh, it's so disappointing when those helmets fall off and you look at this weak little face, isn't it?\"\n\n... said the President of the United States.\n\n15. \"The Democrats lie.\"\n\nIn his first 649 days in office, Trump said 6,420 things that were either totally false or misleading, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker\n\n16. \"They all want to do it. We're going to the make -- lots of great things are going to happen over the next short period of time.\"\n\nWell, I'm convinced! And apparently, so are \"they.\"\n\n17. \"Let me tell you, we would be in a nuclear war right now if the right person didn't come along.\"\n\nIn which Trump claims that had he not been elected, there was a 100% chance that America would be in the midst of a nuclear war with North Korea.\n\n18. \"We're doing great. As a country, we're doing great. We've never done better. We are doing really well.\"\n\nPoint of clarification: Are we doing well?\n\n19. \"We just have to go around 'em, and we have gone around them like nobody in history has ever gone around them.\"\n\nTrump's talking about the media here. And there are two things worth noting: 1) He's \"gone around\" the media by telling his supporters his own version of the truth, which doesn't comport with established facts and 2) Even in this, Trump has to always have done it the best or more than anyone else.\n\n20. \"I want the cleanest water on the planet. We want the cleanest air on the planet. And we've got it.\"\n\n[narrator voice] No, we don't.\n\n21. \"The only time I've seen them, they underestimate the crowd. They want to underestimate that crowd, which is easy for them, actually, to do. But that's a lot of people.\"\n\nIt's not clear who the \"they\" is that Trump is accusing of underestimating the size of the caravan, which has been estimated at more than 7,000 people. It's also not clear why Trump knows there are more people in the caravan than people are estimating.\n\n22. \"You know, I think what happened -- I really believe somebody was involved that's not on our side of the ledger. Somebody was involved.\"\n\nThe President is playing conspiracy theorist in chief here: Suggesting that the caravan was organized by Democrats despite zero available evidence to back up that claim.\n\n23. \"Look what we got, Foxconn, one of the great companies of the world, what they did in Wisconsin for Gov. Walker.\"\n\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics , Walker is losing in seven out of the last 10 polls done in his race.\n\n24. \"I want to give him full credit, because, I'll tell you what, I gave him that one, and he took it, and got it done.\"\n\nThis is amazing. Trump wants to make sure Walker gets full credit for bringing Foxconn to Wisconsin even though \"I gave him that one.\" Riiiiight.\n\n25. \"You have to see what they built in Wisconsin. Scott Walker.\"\n\n26. \"We defeated the Democrat mob and proudly swore in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, who was treated very, very unfairly, by the way, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\"\n\nThis is an interesting way to frame the Kavanaugh confirmation fight which was primarily focused on the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers.\n\n27. \"This will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravans, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense. Common sense.\"\n\nThis is a regular Trump line in these closing days -- and evidence, not that you needed it, that Trump's closing message is entirely focused on motivating his base.\n\n28. \"It's happening faster than anybody can believe. You know, it's all happening much faster than anybody could believe.\"\n\n29. \"Even one of them recently said that President Trump made promises, but he's kept many more promises. I mean, far more than I made.\"\n\n[gets out scratch paper] So, you say you've kept more promises than you've made, eh? OK, let me just calculate that out.... [head explodes]\n\n30. \"It's true. It's true.\"\n\n[narrator voice] It's not. You can't keep more promises than you've made. Everyone knows that. OK, not everyone.\n\n31. \"And nobody in this room -- I see a couple of guys that wouldn't mind, I see a couple of people. I see one woman there that wouldn't mind, too. But nobody here wants to do that. And they do it.\"\n\nTrump -- I think -- is talking about how tough ICE agents are. I think. But what I know is that they \"do that.\" And they don't mind doing that. (No, I don't know what \"that\" is.)\n\n32. \"These people, they call them nests. You go into a nest. They are bad. Everyone needs to show up and vote for Josh Hawley. Please do it.\"\n\nHoly non sequitor, Batman!\n\n33. \"Democrats are the party of open borders, socialism, and crime, whether you like it or not.\"\n\nMaybe it's just me, but this feels like a bit of an oversimplification?\n\n34. \"Hundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants are made automatic citizens of the United States every year because of this crazy, lunatic policy that we can end.\"\n\nThe \"crazy, lunatic\" policy that Trump is referring to is also known as the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n35. \"If you want your children to have a country, vote Republican.\"\n\nSo, if you vote Democratic, the US will cease to exist?\n\n36. \"If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican.\"\n\nTo be clear: The caravan that Trump spends so much time talking about is still hundreds of miles from the US border. And the idea that this group will \"overrun\" America is fear-mongering, plain and simple.\n\n37. \"We're the hot country. Can you believe it?\"\n\n38. \"You know, I meet a lot of leaders. They're great, you know, some of them. Some I like, some I don't like. What the hell.\"\n\n[speechless]\n\n39. \"And then when the election was over, they said, you know, it's an amazing thing. He did great with women. What the hell.\"\n\n40. \"That's why we're doing great with women, and we always have done well with women.\"\n\n[narrator voice] He hasn't.\n\n41. \"And at my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces. It's called the Space Force.\"\n\n42. \"These are the midterms. Nobody thought of the midterms as being that big a deal for years. For years. Nobody thought of the midterms.\"\n\nUh...\n\n43. \"Now, we did have two maniacs stop our momentum that was incredible, because for seven days, nobody talked about the election to stop the tremendous momentum.\"\n\nSo, Trump sees the mail bomber and the synagogue shooter as \"maniacs\" who stopped his campaign momentum. OK! This is fine! Nothing to see here folks!\n\n44. \"You must reject the Democrat politics of anger and hatred and division and fear.\"\n\nReminder: Donald Trump's closing message in this campaign is that horde of illegal immigrants is about to surge across the border and take everything you love and care about. So.....\n\n45. \"It was right here in Missouri that the great explorers, Lewis and Clark -- that's very impressive -- that's very impressive, Lewis and Clark -- that's big time -- began their epic journey across the American West.\"\n\n\"That's big time.\" -- The President of the United States on Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.\n\n46. \"We will never surrender, ever, ever, ever.\"\n\nEver? This feels like a good place to end.", "Phoenix (CNN) Opportunity and necessity alike are pushing Democrats to focus more intently on gaining ground across the Sun Belt in next week's election, from Florida and Georgia in the Southeast to Nevada and Arizona in the Southwest.\n\nThe opportunity comes from changing demographics: with their young, diverse populations and in most cases, growing ranks of white-collar, information-age workers clustered into busting metropolitan areas, the Sun Belt states increasingly embody the modern Democratic electoral coalition.\n\nThe necessity is driven by the prospects of losses for Democrats not only next week, but in years ahead in states across the nation's interior. In an era when older, blue-collar, rural and culturally conservative white voters are moving more toward the Republican Party under Donald Trump, Democrats are facing increasing challenges in Heartland and Rust Belt states dominated by exactly those kinds of voters. That long-term challenge is evident this year in the difficulty Democrats are facing holding Senate seats in North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, and to a slightly lesser extent, Montana and West Virginia.\n\nTo offset what could be future Republican gains in the Heartland at every level -- the House, the Senate and the Electoral College -- Democrats in the coming years will need greater inroads in states across the Sun Belt. These include Florida, North Carolina and Georgia in the Southeast, as well as Arizona, Nevada and eventually Texas in the Southwest. (Two other Southwestern states, Colorado and New Mexico, after performing as swing states earlier this century, now lean more reliably toward the Democrats. Virginia in the Southeast, has followed the same trajectory.)\n\nDespite favorable demography, Democrats have established only a very limited beachhead in these six key Sun Belt battlegrounds. In many of these states, the Democratic Party has been virtually moribund: it hasn't won a statewide office in Texas since 1994 or in Arizona since 2008. In Arizona, Bill Clinton in 1996 is the only Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state since 1948. In 2016, Trump carried all of these states except Nevada. The only governorship among them that Democrats now hold is in North Carolina, and they control just two of their dozen Senate seats (Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada and Bill Nelson, who's locked in a tight battle for reelection with outgoing Gov. Rick Scott in Florida.) Democrats haven't elected a US Senator in Arizona for 30 years.\n\nSun Belt hope for Democrats\n\nBut this year, Democrats are pulsing with vastly more energy across the Sun Belt states, though they still face big structural barriers in all of them.\n\nIn the Southeast, the emergence of the party's first African-American gubernatorial nominees in Georgia (Stacey Abrams) and Florida (Andrew Gillum) has electrified local activists. Both are locked in tight races, with Gillum given slightly better odds. Democrats also have a strong chance to win the governorship in Nevada, though their candidates trail badly in Arizona and Texas. (Democrats are also favored to win the governorships in Colorado and New Mexico, the two Southwestern states that already lean more toward them.)\n\nThe best two Democratic opportunities to pick up a Republican-held Senate seat are in the Southwest: Nevada, where Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is challenging Dean Heller, and Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is battling Republican Rep. Martha McSally. CNN polls released Wednesday showed both Democrats holding a narrow advantage. In Texas, Democrat Rep. Beto O'Rourke has galvanized Democrats nationwide, and raised unprecedented sums of money, while launching a vigorous challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz. O'Rourke still faces a tough climb to beat Cruz, but many Democrats believe his dynamic grassroots campaigning has provided the party a pathway toward restoring its competitiveness in the state.\n\nNew majorities\n\nVolunteers like Lorena with Mi Familia Vota are going door-to-door in Arizona.\n\nAll of these states are politically defined by a stark racial divergence between their diverse youth populations and predominantly white seniors -- what I've called the brown and the gray. Brookings Institution demographer Bill Frey has projected that by 2020, minorities will constitute a clear majority of the under-30 population in Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas, and more than two-fifths of that population in North Carolina. At the same time, the population aged 65 to 69 in each of these states (save for Texas) will remain roughly two-thirds white by then. And even in Texas, whites will represent about three-fifths.\n\nThe political challenge this creates for Democrats is starkly apparent in Arizona. Especially in mid-term elections like this year, young people and minorities here vote at vastly lower rates than older and white people. While over 46% of eligible Arizona whites turned out in 2014, only one-third of African-Americans and slightly less than one-third of Hispanics did so, according to Census Bureau figures. The generational contrast was even more dramatic: While more than three-in-five eligible voters 65 and older voted in Arizona in 2014, according to the Census Bureau, less than one-in-five of those younger than 35 did so, an anemic figure. Chuck Coughlin, a Phoenix-based Republican consultant says it's likely that voters older than 50 will comprise at least 55% of the electorate next week. \"We keep talking about a younger group -- and it will happen -- but as most things happen in politics, it's incremental,\" he says.\n\nDifficulty getting out the Latino vote\n\nEduardo Sainz is the director of Mi Familia Vota and says Latino voter registrtaion is up.\n\nLatino groups in Arizona are mounting a major effort to accelerate that change. Eduardo Sainz, the Arizona director for Mi Familia Vota, says a coalition of Latino groups have registered 200,000 new voters in the state this year. But increasing their turnout remains a grudging process. While Trump has stirred anger among Latinos, Sainz says, it isn't always easy to convince irregular voters that they can express their distaste for him by voting for Democrats in Congressional elections this year.\n\n\"To be honest, it's hard to make sure the community members are participating when [we're] not having Donald Trump on the ballot,\" he says. It doesn't help, he notes, that campaigns have usually focused their own spending on groups considered more likely to show up.\n\nStill, Sainz is confident that the sheer growth in the Latino population will steadily translate into more influence, even if turnout increases only slowly.\n\n\"This is going to be the last election that politicians can take us for granted,\" he says. \"I believe that in the future politicians are not going to have a choice to take us for granted because the demographics in Arizona for Latinos are growing tremendously.\"\n\nAnd Democrats can find reason for optimism in early voting returns that show youth turnout enormously increasing across the Sun Belt states compared to 2014. On the other hand, that growth is measured against a very low base in 2014 turnout, which has caused some experts to question whether or how much young people will increase their actual share of the vote relative to older voters, who are also casting ballots in large numbers so far.\n\nIn any case, increasing turnout among non-white voters, especially younger ones, is only half of the equation for Democrats in all of the Sun Belt states they are hoping to flip. The other is replicating the gains that Democrats in other regions have made with college-educated whites, especially women. In many states along the coasts, Democrats now win about half or more of those college-educated white voters. But those voters are generally more conservative across the Sun Belt: in 2016, Hillary Clinton won less than one-third of college educated whites in Georgia and Texas, only slightly more than one-third in Florida, just under two-fifths in North Carolina and slightly more than two-fifths in Nevada and Arizona. Only in the latter two states did she approach her national share of 45%, according to exit polls.\n\nThis year, unease with Trump among these voters, especially women, have positioned Democrats for gains with them. Abrams and O'Rourke face the toughest roads: though each have notched gains compared to earlier Democrats, most polls show him stuck below 40% with them, and Abrams generally even lower (t hough she is campaigning heavily in the Atlanta suburbs ). But several surveys have shown Gillum in Florida running even or leading among college-educated whites. And the CNN polls this week showed both Rosen and Sinema holding narrow leads among those voters and winning about half of them.\n\n'I haven't moved in my beliefs; the party has moved'\n\nSue Gerard use to be in office as a Republican but now she's supporting a Democrat.\n\nSue Gerard, a former GOP state legislator in Arizona, is one of the college-educated white voters tilting away from the party in the Trump era. Gerard counts conservative icon Barry Goldwater as one of her heroes. Now she's heading a Republicans for Sinema group.\n\n\"It's not as big a step now because so many of my friends and colleagues that were Republicans are no longer Republicans because of what's been happening in the party,\" Gerard says. \"My attitude is I haven't moved in my beliefs, the party has moved, so I'm thinking there will still be a day when moderate Republicans will not be a dirty word or an endangered species.\"\n\nIn all of the Sun Belt states, public polls show Republicans in the key races holding crushing leads among Trump's best constituency: white voters without a college degree. To overcome that, Democrats will need to both turn out more minority and young voters than they have in the past, and run better among college-educated whites in the region. On both fronts, says Coughlin, the GOP consultant, Democrats are likely to post at least some improvement. \"I think they will,\" he says. \"Is it enough to flip? Is it enough to turn it?\"\n\nThe answer to that question in Arizona and other Sun Belt states will likely grow increasingly pressing for Democrats in years ahead as the demographic and geographic resorting of American politics proceeds.\n\nGiven the GOP's strength among older and blue-collar whites -- Trump in 2016 carried three-fifths of whites older than 45 and two-thirds of whites of all ages without a college degree -- Democrats are likely to face growing pressure across older, whiter, heavily Christian interior states. They received a preview of that challenge in 2016 when Trump swept Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, while coming close to swiping Minnesota.\n\nGOP consultant Chuck Coughlin says older voters are still going to be a majority of voters.\n\nThis year, Democrats have stabilized their position in all six of those states. Democratic Senate incumbents are seeking reelection in each of them except Iowa and all of them are solid favorites to win next week. Democrats are also favored to win the governorships in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota and are locked in toss up races in the other three states.\n\nYet even with that recovery in the industrial Midwest, next week could dramatize the long-term threat to Democrats across these older interior states. The party is still at high risk of losing Senate seats in five other Heartland states. The greatest danger confronts Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Joe Donnelly in Indiana leads in the latest public polls but trailed in surveys earlier in October. Though the polls send somewhat conflicting signals, Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana appear better positioned to survive.\n\nArizona and Nevada offer Democrats their best opportunity this year to counter those possible Senate losses in the Heartland. Gains across the Sun Belt could be even more important for the party's presidential ticket in 2020 when all signs suggest Trump will remain a formidable competitor for the big Rust Belt battlegrounds generally tilting back toward the Democrats this year. This year's big marquee races across the Sun Belt-the governor's contests in Florida and Georgia along with the Senate races in Nevada, Arizona and Texas -- will offer important clues about whether these states are moving toward the Democrats, or remain leaning toward the GOP, as attention turns from the midterm toward the epic presidential showdown of 2020.", "Phoenix (CNN) Opportunity and necessity alike are pushing Democrats to focus more intently on gaining ground across the Sun Belt in next week's election, from Florida and Georgia in the Southeast to Nevada and Arizona in the Southwest.\n\nThe opportunity comes from changing demographics: with their young, diverse populations and in most cases, growing ranks of white-collar, information-age workers clustered into busting metropolitan areas, the Sun Belt states increasingly embody the modern Democratic electoral coalition.\n\nThe necessity is driven by the prospects of losses for Democrats not only next week, but in years ahead in states across the nation's interior. In an era when older, blue-collar, rural and culturally conservative white voters are moving more toward the Republican Party under Donald Trump, Democrats are facing increasing challenges in Heartland and Rust Belt states dominated by exactly those kinds of voters. That long-term challenge is evident this year in the difficulty Democrats are facing holding Senate seats in North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, and to a slightly lesser extent, Montana and West Virginia.\n\nTo offset what could be future Republican gains in the Heartland at every level -- the House, the Senate and the Electoral College -- Democrats in the coming years will need greater inroads in states across the Sun Belt. These include Florida, North Carolina and Georgia in the Southeast, as well as Arizona, Nevada and eventually Texas in the Southwest. (Two other Southwestern states, Colorado and New Mexico, after performing as swing states earlier this century, now lean more reliably toward the Democrats. Virginia in the Southeast, has followed the same trajectory.)\n\nDespite favorable demography, Democrats have established only a very limited beachhead in these six key Sun Belt battlegrounds. In many of these states, the Democratic Party has been virtually moribund: it hasn't won a statewide office in Texas since 1994 or in Arizona since 2008. In Arizona, Bill Clinton in 1996 is the only Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state since 1948. In 2016, Trump carried all of these states except Nevada. The only governorship among them that Democrats now hold is in North Carolina, and they control just two of their dozen Senate seats (Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada and Bill Nelson, who's locked in a tight battle for reelection with outgoing Gov. Rick Scott in Florida.) Democrats haven't elected a US Senator in Arizona for 30 years.\n\nSun Belt hope for Democrats\n\nBut this year, Democrats are pulsing with vastly more energy across the Sun Belt states, though they still face big structural barriers in all of them.\n\nIn the Southeast, the emergence of the party's first African-American gubernatorial nominees in Georgia (Stacey Abrams) and Florida (Andrew Gillum) has electrified local activists. Both are locked in tight races, with Gillum given slightly better odds. Democrats also have a strong chance to win the governorship in Nevada, though their candidates trail badly in Arizona and Texas. (Democrats are also favored to win the governorships in Colorado and New Mexico, the two Southwestern states that already lean more toward them.)\n\nThe best two Democratic opportunities to pick up a Republican-held Senate seat are in the Southwest: Nevada, where Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is challenging Dean Heller, and Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is battling Republican Rep. Martha McSally. CNN polls released Wednesday showed both Democrats holding a narrow advantage. In Texas, Democrat Rep. Beto O'Rourke has galvanized Democrats nationwide, and raised unprecedented sums of money, while launching a vigorous challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz. O'Rourke still faces a tough climb to beat Cruz, but many Democrats believe his dynamic grassroots campaigning has provided the party a pathway toward restoring its competitiveness in the state.\n\nNew majorities\n\nVolunteers like Lorena with Mi Familia Vota are going door-to-door in Arizona.\n\nAll of these states are politically defined by a stark racial divergence between their diverse youth populations and predominantly white seniors -- what I've called the brown and the gray. Brookings Institution demographer Bill Frey has projected that by 2020, minorities will constitute a clear majority of the under-30 population in Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas, and more than two-fifths of that population in North Carolina. At the same time, the population aged 65 to 69 in each of these states (save for Texas) will remain roughly two-thirds white by then. And even in Texas, whites will represent about three-fifths.\n\nThe political challenge this creates for Democrats is starkly apparent in Arizona. Especially in mid-term elections like this year, young people and minorities here vote at vastly lower rates than older and white people. While over 46% of eligible Arizona whites turned out in 2014, only one-third of African-Americans and slightly less than one-third of Hispanics did so, according to Census Bureau figures. The generational contrast was even more dramatic: While more than three-in-five eligible voters 65 and older voted in Arizona in 2014, according to the Census Bureau, less than one-in-five of those younger than 35 did so, an anemic figure. Chuck Coughlin, a Phoenix-based Republican consultant says it's likely that voters older than 50 will comprise at least 55% of the electorate next week. \"We keep talking about a younger group -- and it will happen -- but as most things happen in politics, it's incremental,\" he says.\n\nDifficulty getting out the Latino vote\n\nEduardo Sainz is the director of Mi Familia Vota and says Latino voter registrtaion is up.\n\nLatino groups in Arizona are mounting a major effort to accelerate that change. Eduardo Sainz, the Arizona director for Mi Familia Vota, says a coalition of Latino groups have registered 200,000 new voters in the state this year. But increasing their turnout remains a grudging process. While Trump has stirred anger among Latinos, Sainz says, it isn't always easy to convince irregular voters that they can express their distaste for him by voting for Democrats in Congressional elections this year.\n\n\"To be honest, it's hard to make sure the community members are participating when [we're] not having Donald Trump on the ballot,\" he says. It doesn't help, he notes, that campaigns have usually focused their own spending on groups considered more likely to show up.\n\nStill, Sainz is confident that the sheer growth in the Latino population will steadily translate into more influence, even if turnout increases only slowly.\n\n\"This is going to be the last election that politicians can take us for granted,\" he says. \"I believe that in the future politicians are not going to have a choice to take us for granted because the demographics in Arizona for Latinos are growing tremendously.\"\n\nAnd Democrats can find reason for optimism in early voting returns that show youth turnout enormously increasing across the Sun Belt states compared to 2014. On the other hand, that growth is measured against a very low base in 2014 turnout, which has caused some experts to question whether or how much young people will increase their actual share of the vote relative to older voters, who are also casting ballots in large numbers so far.\n\nIn any case, increasing turnout among non-white voters, especially younger ones, is only half of the equation for Democrats in all of the Sun Belt states they are hoping to flip. The other is replicating the gains that Democrats in other regions have made with college-educated whites, especially women. In many states along the coasts, Democrats now win about half or more of those college-educated white voters. But those voters are generally more conservative across the Sun Belt: in 2016, Hillary Clinton won less than one-third of college educated whites in Georgia and Texas, only slightly more than one-third in Florida, just under two-fifths in North Carolina and slightly more than two-fifths in Nevada and Arizona. Only in the latter two states did she approach her national share of 45%, according to exit polls.\n\nThis year, unease with Trump among these voters, especially women, have positioned Democrats for gains with them. Abrams and O'Rourke face the toughest roads: though each have notched gains compared to earlier Democrats, most polls show him stuck below 40% with them, and Abrams generally even lower (t hough she is campaigning heavily in the Atlanta suburbs ). But several surveys have shown Gillum in Florida running even or leading among college-educated whites. And the CNN polls this week showed both Rosen and Sinema holding narrow leads among those voters and winning about half of them.\n\n'I haven't moved in my beliefs; the party has moved'\n\nSue Gerard use to be in office as a Republican but now she's supporting a Democrat.\n\nSue Gerard, a former GOP state legislator in Arizona, is one of the college-educated white voters tilting away from the party in the Trump era. Gerard counts conservative icon Barry Goldwater as one of her heroes. Now she's heading a Republicans for Sinema group.\n\n\"It's not as big a step now because so many of my friends and colleagues that were Republicans are no longer Republicans because of what's been happening in the party,\" Gerard says. \"My attitude is I haven't moved in my beliefs, the party has moved, so I'm thinking there will still be a day when moderate Republicans will not be a dirty word or an endangered species.\"\n\nIn all of the Sun Belt states, public polls show Republicans in the key races holding crushing leads among Trump's best constituency: white voters without a college degree. To overcome that, Democrats will need to both turn out more minority and young voters than they have in the past, and run better among college-educated whites in the region. On both fronts, says Coughlin, the GOP consultant, Democrats are likely to post at least some improvement. \"I think they will,\" he says. \"Is it enough to flip? Is it enough to turn it?\"\n\nThe answer to that question in Arizona and other Sun Belt states will likely grow increasingly pressing for Democrats in years ahead as the demographic and geographic resorting of American politics proceeds.\n\nGiven the GOP's strength among older and blue-collar whites -- Trump in 2016 carried three-fifths of whites older than 45 and two-thirds of whites of all ages without a college degree -- Democrats are likely to face growing pressure across older, whiter, heavily Christian interior states. They received a preview of that challenge in 2016 when Trump swept Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, while coming close to swiping Minnesota.\n\nGOP consultant Chuck Coughlin says older voters are still going to be a majority of voters.\n\nThis year, Democrats have stabilized their position in all six of those states. Democratic Senate incumbents are seeking reelection in each of them except Iowa and all of them are solid favorites to win next week. Democrats are also favored to win the governorships in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota and are locked in toss up races in the other three states.\n\nYet even with that recovery in the industrial Midwest, next week could dramatize the long-term threat to Democrats across these older interior states. The party is still at high risk of losing Senate seats in five other Heartland states. The greatest danger confronts Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Joe Donnelly in Indiana leads in the latest public polls but trailed in surveys earlier in October. Though the polls send somewhat conflicting signals, Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana appear better positioned to survive.\n\nArizona and Nevada offer Democrats their best opportunity this year to counter those possible Senate losses in the Heartland. Gains across the Sun Belt could be even more important for the party's presidential ticket in 2020 when all signs suggest Trump will remain a formidable competitor for the big Rust Belt battlegrounds generally tilting back toward the Democrats this year. This year's big marquee races across the Sun Belt-the governor's contests in Florida and Georgia along with the Senate races in Nevada, Arizona and Texas -- will offer important clues about whether these states are moving toward the Democrats, or remain leaning toward the GOP, as attention turns from the midterm toward the epic presidential showdown of 2020.", "(CNN) \"Magnified and sanctified is God's Holy Name.\"\n\nThat's a translation of the phrase that topped the front page of Friday's Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\n\"These are the first words of the Jewish mourners' prayer, which will be recited tonight on the first Sabbath since the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting,\" the paper explained.\n\nThe prayer, the Mourner's Kaddish, is traditionally recited for 11 months following the death of a parent or close relative or on the anniversary of the death of a parent or close relative.

It's special, it's nice for them to be there and watch it.\n\n\"He's good [as a caddy]. I probably pick most of the clubs but if I'm stuck he'll help me out and most of the time he's right. He keeps me calm. We have chats about other things as well, like my brother or sister, or that sort of thing.\n\n\"He's watched me practice all my life so he's watched my good and bad shots and what I tend to do on the golf course.\"", "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.", "(CNN) International outcry over the grisly murder of a dissident journalist is not likely to alter US backing of domineering Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nThere is little expectation among Trump administration aides that President Donald Trump and his team will step back from supporting Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto leader, despite a quiet acknowledgment among most officials that he had some knowledge of the plot to silence Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist who was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\n\nIn a sign the administration and its supporters are not backing off support for Mohammed, a group of evangelical leaders -- some closely associated with Trump -- met in Riyadh this week with the crown prince.\n\nInstead of backing off Prince Mohammed, the US hopes to capitalize on what it regards as new leverage with Saudi Arabia to end the brutal civil war in Yemen and ease a regional standoff with Qatar, according to multiple US and diplomatic officials.\n\nSeeing an opening created by the kingdom's new pariah status, US officials say the time is ripe to move on longstanding goals, including forcing an end to the Saudi-led bombing campaign that has prompted a humanitarian crisis in neighboring Yemen.\n\nRead More",

But it is worth noting that other Trump family members and Cabinet officials are acting as surrogates for the President as heated election battles are waged across the country.\n\n\"Due to her schedule as a mother and as first lady, especially with the upcoming holidays and international travel, there are no plans for her to campaign,\" Trump's spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN.\n\nThe first lady is scheduled to join the President when he travels to Paris on November 11.\n\nIvanka Trump spent Thursday in Nevada, barnstorming for Sen. Dean Heller; on Friday, she is in Iowa to campaign for Gov. Kim Reynolds. Earlier this week, Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle, traveled to a campaign event in West Virginia, where the couple posed for selfies and ginned up excitement for Patrick Morrisey, the Republican challenging Sen. Joe Manchin. Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle are expected to hit at least a dozen more events around the country before Election Day. And Eric Trump, along with his wife, Lara, is a regular presence in Trump rally world, often introducing the President and speaking before he takes the podium, as they did last week in Houston.\n\nNot a priority\n\nJUST WATCHED Melania discusses husband's immigration policies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Melania discusses husband's immigration policies 01:47\n\nFor the first lady, however, making time to campaign for Republicans, even while her husband does a whopping 11 rallies in a week, isn't a priority. Her last major campaign appearance and speech was nearly two years ago, days before the November 2016 presidential election, when she made remarks in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Every time my husband learned of a factory closing in Ohio or North Carolina or Pennsylvania, I could see him get very upset,\" she said at the time.\n\nTrump also talked about being an immigrant, wanting to help children fight bullying and the need for more compassionate dialogue. All of these are issues that remain relevant parts of the national conversation on the eve of midterms.\n\n\"The first lady has the highest approval rating of anyone in the administration,\" says Doug Heye, a CNN political commentator, GOP consultant and communications operative. \"There is practically no Republican candidate that would not want her to campaign, or benefit from her, especially since she can help smooth out some of the administration's rougher edges.\"\n\nThe first lady has a favorable rating 13 points higher than that of her husband, according to the most recent CNN poll , with Melania Trump at 54% and the President at 41%.\n\n\"First ladies are typically more relatable than their husbands,\" says Kate Andersen Brower, a CNN contributor and author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\"\n\n\"People often say they feel like they could sit down and have a cup of coffee with them,\" she said.\n\nWhile that familiarity might apply more to Laura or Barbara Bush, or Michelle Obama, Brower stresses even mild interaction with the public at a political appearance can be very helpful.\n\n\"First ladies usually campaign for their husbands and report back the concerns they hear from voters,\" she said.\n\nTrump remains a top adviser to her husband and is a more influential confidante than the couple's public interaction, and salacious headlines about their marriage, might imply. In a rare exchange with reporters last month in Egypt, Trump said she regularly discusses important political issues with the President.\n\n\"Well, I don't always agree (with) what he thinks and I tell him that. I give him my honest opinion and honest advice,\" she said, admitting that \"sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't.\"\n\nBrower said often first ladies can be a secret weapons for their spouses.\n\n\"They can be a gut check for their husbands, who are often surrounded by advisers who are reluctant to disagree with them,\" she said.\n\nAsked whether Trump, although not physically present at campaign events, stays in the loop on her husband's midterm push agenda and if she weighs in on his rally appearances, Grisham responded, \"Yes.\"\n\nHowever, the role Melania Trump won't compromise, even for the President of the United States, appears to be that of mother to the first couple's 12-year-old son. During the presidential campaign, Trump cited being a constant presence at home for Barron Trump as the No. 1 reason she would not be a regular at events, unlike previous first ladies.\n\n\"I tend to think it's helpful to be open and honest with people and having the President's wife and children on the campaign trail usually helps soften the President's image. It brings out their humanity,\" says Brower. \"But it's also clear that Melania Trump is a very private person with a young son who didn't want this life, so why should she be compelled to campaign?\"\n\nPotential impact?\n\nJUST WATCHED Melania dismisses media reports: 'We are fine' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Melania dismisses media reports: 'We are fine' 01:53\n\nFirst ladies can have an effect on the trail.\n\nOne would be hard-pressed to forget then-first lady Michelle Obama's speech on Hillary Clinton's behalf at the July 2016 Democratic National Convention, despite Clinton's 2016 loss.\n\nHer \"when they go low, we go high\" line is still part of the political vernacular, and became Clinton's unofficial campaign slogan. In 2008 and 2012, President Barack Obama's campaign aides anointed Michelle Obama \"The Closer.\" That's not to imply Clinton didn't do her fair share of campaign events when she was first lady; prior to the midterm elections in 1998, Clinton visited about 20 states. In 2006, Laura Bush did 20 events and raised millions for the Republican Party.\n\nIn staying off the campaign trail, Melania Trump again reformulates the traditional definition of is usually expected of a first lady.\n\n\"Lady Bird Johnson, Rosalynn Carter and Barbara Bush were each tireless campaigners,\" Brower said, noting the differences between other modern first ladies and Trump.\n\n\"Rosalynn would number her husband's jokes so that he wouldn't repeat any to the same group, she typed thank-you notes to people her husband met on the campaign trail, and she even started taking memory classes to remember faces and names when he ran for governor of Georgia,\" she said.\n\nTrump is more comparable to Jacqueline Kennedy, Brower said, who felt as though she was more of a hinderance than help during John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign. Kennedy was criticized for being too rich, too beautiful or \"too comically breathy,\" Brower said. \"Of course, that turned around when she became first lady, when women all over the world tried to dress like her and get their hair done like hers.\"\n\nTrump, it appears, is comfortable with being more seen than heard in her own iteration of presidential spouse. While she has a public presence and is pushing a platform -- \"Be Best,\" which is centered around the well-being of children -- Trump rarely gives speeches that last longer than three or four minutes in length and don't stray into controversial territory.\n\nShe also remains highly wary of the press, giving only two on-camera interviews in the past year. She is not a regular on the cover of magazines or on the talk show circuit, as was Michelle Obama, and she has not found a comfortable and consistent footing in the Washington social spotlight.\n\nQuiet presence\n\nTrump prefers to be a frequent participant in White House events, showcasing her hostess side, greeting the wives of visiting dignitaries, welcoming children to events about bullying and pushing her anti-opioid message. She has participated in more than a dozen events over the past month, including several on her first solo international trip as first lady to Africa in October , and has accompanied her husband on his visit to hurricane-ravaged Florida; most recently, she went with the President to Pittsburgh, the site of last week's horrific shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue.\n\nWith the holidays approaching, aides say Trump will likely throw herself not into election analysis but into the planning and execution of dozens of events the White House hosts during the season. Grisham confirmed this is one of the reasons the first lady is not making the rounds of campaigning.\n\n\"This is one of the busiest times of the year for the East Wing,\" Grisham said.\n\nTrump did delve into the realm of politics recently, revealing in an interview with ABC News during her trip to Africa in October that she agreed with her husband's stance on immigration and that while she thought women \"need to be heard,\" she believes they also need to have \"hard evidence\" before making accusations of sexual misconduct\n\nLike the President, she said she supports men just as much as women. Trump also made her first comment on the reports of her husband's past alleged infidelities, saying the issue is \"not a concern\" of hers.\n\nThe lack of campaign events, and the fervent commitment to her life as a mother (and as a wife able to essentially wave off salacious stories about her spouse) will likely only serve to continue to fill the vacuum of questions about who this first lady is, at her core, and fuel armchair assessments and speculation.\n\n\"I think it's helpful and important to have some sense of who the first lady is and what she stands for,\" Brower said. \"Because Melania has been such a reluctant presence on the campaign trail, we may never know what's truly in her heart.\"", "Washington (CNN) The Trump administration is set to reimpose all sanctions against Iran that had been lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday.\n\n\"On November 5th, the United States will reimpose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal on Iran's energy, shipbuilding, shipping, and banking sectors,\" Pompeo said.\n\nPompeo also said the US will grant temporary waivers to eight \"jurisdictions\" from energy-related sanctions that will also be reimposed on Monday as the Trump administration seeks to ratchet up pressure on the Iranian regime.\n\nThe moves are part of what sources close to the administration describe as the US' \"economic war\" on the Iranian regime, with one source saying it's part of a broad effort to squeeze Tehran that includes regional pressure and covert action.\n\nPompeo himself promised on Friday, as he previewed the coming sanctions, that they were just one part of a deeper effort.\n\n\"The administration's efforts to change Iranian behavior are far broader, far deeper. There are many other lines of effort,\" he said. \"We're simply focused on this line of effort today because of the significance of November 5th.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump was focused on sanctions Friday, following up on Pompeo's comments by tweeting a \"Game of Thrones\"-style image of himself with the words \"sanctions are coming.\"\n\nLater in the day, Trump told reporters at the White House that \"as you know, sanctions are starting on Iran, and Iran is taking a very big hit. The country is not the same country as when I started almost two years ago. That is a very different country since I terminated that deal,\" he said.\n\nThe top US diplomat, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, outlined the administration's latest punitive steps against Tehran since leaving the Iran nuclear deal in May. The international agreement had been one of President Barack Obama's signature achievements and a frequent target of Trump's ire.\n\nHitting core areas\n\n\"These sanctions hit at core areas of Iran's economy,\" Pompeo said in a call with reporters. \"They're necessary to spur changes we seek on the part of the regime. In order to maximize the effect of the President's pressure campaign, we have worked closely with other countries to cut off Iranian oil exports as much as possible.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has laid out 12 conditions Iran must meet before Washington will lift sanctions, requirements that many analysts see as a call for regime change in all but name.\n\n\"We want to restore democracy there,\" Pompeo said of Iran in a Wednesday interview with Laura Ingraham. In 1953, the US backed a coup that overthrew Iran's democratically elected government and then supported the repressive rule of Shah Reza Pahlavi.\n\n\"We think the Iranian people want that same thing,\" Pompeo continued to Ingraham. \"And so our aim is not to harm the Iranian people, but to change the behavior, the malign activity of this regime.\"\n\nMnuchin said that when the so-called snapback sanctions go into effect on Monday, more than 700 names will added to the Treasury Department's list of blocked entities.\n\n\"This include hundreds of targets previously granted sanctions relief\" under the nuclear deal, \"as well more than 300 new designations,\" he said. \"This is substantially more than we have previously done.\"\n\nHe said the sanctions will be reimposed on \"individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft.\" Mnuchin also said the list of banks will be \"substantial longer\" than those previously sanctioned before the Iran nuclear deal was put in place. A final list of institutions will be released on Monday, the secretary said.\n\nThe two Cabinet officials said exemptions would be made for humanitarian imports, which could include food, medicine and other items.\n\nBoth said Iran was already feeling the heat. Analysts agreed.\n\n\"There's no doubt the country is on the verge of crisis, but I think we're quite a ways away from being on the verge of collapse,\" said Henry Rome, an associate with the Eurasia Group. \"It's the biggest crisis the Islamic Republic has faced since the Iran-Iraq war,\" Rome said, adding that \"the people are going to suffer greatly. They already have.\"\n\nNo EU waiver\n\nPompeo said the eight jurisdictions being granted exemptions for energy related sanctions were on the list because they had \"made important moves to get to zero crude oil importations.\" He said they will be named on Monday.\n\nThe European Union will not be getting a waiver, Pompeo said. The EU, along with China, Russia, France, Germany and the UK, the other signatories to the deal, has staunchly opposed the US move to leave the 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\nOn Friday, the EU, France, Germany and the UK issued a joint statement saying they \"deeply regret the further re-imposition of sanctions by the United States.\" The nuclear deal, which they still adhere to, \"is crucial for the security of Europe, the region, and the entire world,\" the group said.\n\nJapan, South Korea and India are widely expected to be given exemptions to sanctions on Iranian energy imports. Pompeo said countries are getting waivers \"only because they have demonstrated significant reductions in their crude oil, and cooperation on many other fronts, and have made important moves towards getting to zero crude oil importation.\" He added that \"these negotiations are still ongoing.\"\n\nAccording to Pompeo, six of the jurisdictions will import Iranian crude oil at \"greatly reduced levels\" and two will completely end their imports.\n\nJUST WATCHED Iran FM: Previous progress we made thrown out Replay More Videos ...

Severing Iranian banks' ties to Swift would prevent those institutions from transferring money to and from the rest of the world.\n\nThe US government has advised Swift to stop providing services to certain designated Iranian entities as part of its maximum pressure campaign against Tehran, but it is allowing it time to wind down those services, the secretary said.\n\nTransactions tied to humanitarian services will still be allowed under the sanctions agreement, but Mnuchin warned institutions to be \"very careful\" that they are not disguised financial transactions.", "(CNN) House forecast: Democrats will win 226 seats (and the House majority) while Republicans will win just 209 seats. A Democratic win of 203 seats and 262 seats is within the margin of error.\n\nFor those of you hoping the 2018 midterms will end on Election Day, I have some bad news: It's possible that we go into overtime.\n\nI'm not just talking recounts. I'm talking about runoff elections in Georgia and Mississippi.\n\nLet's look at Georgia first.\n\nGeorgia state law requires that a candidate receives a majority of the vote in order to win. Right now, it's not clear that either Democrat Stacey Abrams or Republican Brian Kemp will reach the magical 50%+ on November 6. That's because Libertarian Ted Metz is also running.\n\nWhen one averages all the polls taken in October and allocate the undecideds between Abrams and Kemp, Kemp leads with 49.3% to Abrams 48.3% to Metz's 2.3%. In other words, if the polls were right on (and they probably won't be), Kemp and Abrams would face each other in a runoff on December 4.\n\nIt would be tempting to assume that Kemp would be a favorite for that runoff. Not only would he have earned the most votes in the general election, he'd be likely to pick up more of Metz's votes than Abrams would.\n\nAdditionally, runoffs in Georgia have not been kind to Democrats over the last 26 years. Back in 1992, Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler won a plurality (not a majority) in the general election. He lost the runoff to Republican Paul Coverdell with turnout a little more than half what it had been in the general election.\n\nIn the 2008 Senate race, it was basically the same story. Republican Saxby Chambliss got three points more of the vote than Democrat Jim Martin in the general election but fell short of 50%. Chambliss, however, would beat Martin by 15 points in the runoff. Like in 1992, turnout was significantly lower in the runoff than it had been in the general election.\n\nLow turnout on its own didn't hurt the Democrats in those races. It was the fact black voters didn't turn out in as high numbers relative to white voters in either runoff. Although Georgia's vote isn't divided along racial lines as much as it is in Mississippi, Democrats need high black turnout in order to win in Georgia.\n\nThe question, therefore, is whether black voters will turn out for a runoff election in 2018. It's not clear whether 1992 or 2008 are a good guide for what might happen.\n\nBoth 1992 and 2008 were presidential years, which usually feature significantly higher turnout than a midterm election. This is a midterm election where turnout is going to be lower. It's taking place in a year when we've already seen high Democratic turnout in special elections off cycle.\n\nPerhaps as importantly, 2008 featured the first black presidential major party nominee in Barack Obama, who was not on the ballot in the runoff.\n\nThis year is something different all together. Abrams, who is aiming to become the first black woman governor, will be on the ballot in both the general election and the runoff. It's not difficult to imagine that black voters would come out to vote in the runoff in a way they might not otherwise if the Democratic candidate were white.\n\nIndeed, Louisiana's recent runoffs tell a very different story than Georgia's. Looking to Louisiana isn't a perfect guide, but it gives us some guidance on midterms. Unlike Georgia, Louisiana, another southern state with racially polarized voting patterns, has recently held major statewide runoffs in midterm cycles. Both the 2002 and 2014 Senate races required runoffs.\n\nInstead of seeing the black percentage of the electorate fall in the runoff relative to the November election, it actually rose in both 2002 and 2014 . In 2002, it went from 25.9% to 27.1%. In 2014, it climbed from 28.8% to 30.3%. These 1-point to 2 point differences may not seem like they matter. They could.\n\nBecause of the state's racial voting patterns, increasing the black percentage of the electorate by even a point could swing a 1 point Kemp lead in the general election to a 1 point Abrams win in the runoff.\n\nThe power of the black vote in southern politics shouldn't be underestimated. In 2014, the top vote getter in the Mississippi Republican Senate race changed between the primary and primary runoff. Why? It was thanks to an unusual and seemingly successful attempt by Thad Cochran's campaign to get black voters who hadn't voted in the primary to vote in the runoff.\n\nSpeaking of Mississippi, it seems likely at this point that there will be runoff in the state's special Senate election. This Tuesday's election will act as a primary in which all the candidates, regardless of party affiliation, will run against each other.\n\nThe major vote getters in the primary look to be Democrat Mike Espy, Republican Chris McDaniel and Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith. The polling isn't entirely clear, but it seems plausible that Espy will finish first because the Republican candidates will split the Republican vote.\n\nThe bad news for Espy is that none of the polls have him close to a majority on Tuesday. In fact, no poll has any of the candidates close to 50% at this time. They all, however, have Espy and Hyde-Smith finishing either first or second with McDaniel in third. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff in late November will be held between the top two vote getters.\n\nHyde-Smith would be a heavy favorite in a runoff against Espy. Our forecast has her favored by 15 points.\n\nWere McDaniel to make the runoff with Espy, polls indicate that Espy would have a real chance of winning. That match up seems unlikely at this point.\n\nOne final and exhausting scenario is that after Election Day, Democrats control 50 Senate seats, Republicans control 49 Senate seats and Mississippi requires a runoff. If Espy and McDaniel make that runoff, we might not know who controls the Senate until late November. If it's Espy and Hyde-Smith, we won't be able to call Senate control next week, but the answer to the question of who will control will be more of mere formality than anything else.", "\u0648\u0647\u0627 \u0642\u062f \u0628\u062f\u0623 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644\u064a \u0644\u0644\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0633\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0629 \"WWE\"\u060c \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629. \u0641\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0628\u0631\u0632 \u062a\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0644\u0647\u061f\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u060c 02 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "(CNN) If you see Barbra Streisand driving on the streets of Los Angeles, you might want to get out of the way.\n\n\"Late Late Show\" host James Corden switched things up on Thursday night's episode of \"Carpool Karaoke\" by having the music legend be the one behind the wheel, while he sat in the passenger seat.\n\nWithin minutes of getting into the car, Streisand told Corden that she recently had to retake her driving test in order to renew her driver's license.

It is expected to bring in roughly $35 million domestically this weekend, adding to a strong box-office year that is up 11% over last year, according to comScore.\n\nIn the film, Queen battles with a record executive who tells them that their 1975 opus \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won't get played on the radio because it's too long.

RODRIGO ARANGUA/AFP/Getty Image\n\nThe Panama Canal, labeled one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the American Society of Civil Engineers, has played a huge role in Panama's evolution.\n\nBefore it existed, ships were forced to navigate around Cape Horn, a hazardous journey near the tip of South America.\n\nAlthough France began the building process back in the late 1800s, the canal was eventually completed in 1914 by the United States, which had been granted control of the 10-mile-wide Canal Zone in exchange for $10 million, as well as annual payments.\n\nThe project wasn't without its costs, both human and financial.\n\nRelated content Berlin: The city where anything goes\n\nMore than $375 million, equivalent to about $8.6 billion today, was spent by the United States to finish it. The bigger price was the five thousand lives lost as a result of diseases or accidents during the US construction period.\n\nWith the canal subsequently owned and operated by America for 70 years, it wasn't until December 1999 that Panama gained complete control of this vital waterway that split the country in half.\n\nToday, more than 15,000 vessels travel through the 82-kilometer canal each year.\n\nIt makes a contribution of up to 40% of Panama's economy, registering a total of $2.238 million in toll revenues during fiscal year 2017 alone.\n\nNew identity\n\nBenaim believes that Panama experienced a rebirth when it was granted free control of the canal.\n\n\"Historically Panama is just over a hundred years old, but it's really only been independent since the Americans left,\" he says.\n\nAbner Benaim: \"Panama is a very young country.\" CNN\n\n\"That's the first time that Panama stood on its own. It's a very young country in that sense. Growing up is hard. Being left alone and being independent is very hard.\"\n\nHowever, Panama has been carving out an identity of its own in the nearly two decades since then.\n\nNowhere is this more prevalent than in Panama City, which is home to around half of the country's residents and the only capital city in the world that holds a rainforest within its city limits.\n\nWhile its old town has been lovingly restored, a gleaming skyline of tower blocks and skyscrapers has emerged victoriously.\n\nThe latter has become a defining point of Panama City.\n\nPanamanian real estate developer Octavio Vallarino played a significant role in modernizing the city and has five buildings under construction.\n\n\"Even though I'm a Panamanian, it impresses me to see the skyline,\" says Vallarino. \"I think it's a reflection of prosperity, a reflection of confidence.\"\n\nThe capital city is also home to Central America's first urban rail system -- the Panama Metro -- which launched in 2014.\n\nHappy place\n\nVallarino is extremely proud of the progress Panama has made, but holds a somewhat controversial viewpoint on the reasons behind this.\n\n\"The invasion by the US gave Panama a good housekeeping seal that makes us one of the safest places in the world,\" he says. \"If the Americans had not been here, Panama would not be what it is today.\n\n\"It's why we have a lot of foreigners that come to live here and do business.

Kobrin is the Russell and Bettina Knapp Associate Professor of American Jewish history at Columbia University. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) As the grieving Pittsburgh Jewish community buries its friends and family, Jewish organizations have launched the #ShowUpForShabbat campaign, an appeal to all Americans aimed at filling synagogues across the United States this weekend. As the head of the American Jewish Committee, David Harris, proclaimed , \"We're not going to be cowed into silence (or) stay home. ... We're going to show up.\" Thousands of non-Jews are expected to show up in synagogues to see what a gunman felt so threatened by that he had to try to destroy it.\n\nBut those who come to synagogue will not see the primary Jewish ritual to deal with the aftermath of death, shiva, a traditional week of mourning and reflection in which community members offer condolences and families reflect on lives lost. The joy of Sabbath pauses shiva for 24 hours, but it would be useful for the nation to \"show up\" to a week of shiva as well.\n\nShiva serves many purposes, but its most important one is that it allows mourners to contemplate the past as a way to move forward. It is essential the nation use this time to think about what led us to this moment, the largest loss of life in an anti-Semitic incident in US history.\n\nOne thing that brought us to this point is America's long history of linking nativism, anti-Semitism and immigration. The Pittsburgh shooting suspect claims he was driven to kill people on Saturday in order to save his country. By his own words, he believed Jews were destroying American society through their embrace of refugees and so-called immigrant invaders.\n\nNot long before the synagogue rampage, Robert Bowers posted to social media , \"I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.\"This demonization of the threat posed by immigrants and Jews exploded inside the Tree of Life not by accident but by design. We must think about how to change the design to move the nation forward.\n\nSeeing immigration as killing the nation, the suspect singled out HIAS , an organization founded in 1892 to deal with the specific issues facing Jewish migrants stranded on Ellis Island -- stemming from the need for kosher food to their requirements for a proper Jewish burial. \"HIAS likes to bring invaders that kill our people,\" Bowers claimed.\n\nIndeed, Bowers represents nothing new in American history. He tapped into not just a hatred of Jews, which has taken many forms over the last two centuries in the Americas, but he also -- by connecting anti-Semitism to deep fear of immigrants as a national threat -- embodies a long-standing approach to immigration.\n\nThis is what the nation must reflect upon in the days beyond #ShowUpForShabbat. In my work as a scholar of Jewish immigration, I examine with my students the ways in which the very architecture of our entire immigration quota system was built on the linking of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism to nativist beliefs about the threat posed by \"new\" immigrants, namely individuals from Southern and Eastern Europe, to the moral fiber of the nation.\n\nA century ago, men such as University of Wisconsin sociologist Edward Ross penned influential works on \"new\" immigrants that claimed certain groups would not be able to assimilate into American society. He, along with other scholars and politicians of his day, openly embraced eugenics when discussing the nation's immigration problem and claimed Jews were trying to control US immigration policy. Ross also singled out in this work \"the endeavor of the Jews to control the immigration policy of the United States.\"\n\nThis bogus anti-Semitic lie was based on the fact that Jewish American lawyers, some linked to HIAS, believed that to be American hinged on a belief in certain ideals, not in one's race or place of birth. HIAS and many other organizations see immigrants as central to America's identity as they speak to what they see as this nation's core values, and immigrants, with the help of groups such as HIAS, have been shown by economists to expand the economy.\n\nAt a time when the world was grappling with one of the largest refugee crises in a century, HIAS made a point that refugees and migrants were not a threat to the nation. But many did not agree and saw a world in which immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe were a threat. As Ross argued, \"The literature that proves the blessings of immigration to all classes in America emanates from subtle Hebrew brains.\"\n\nThe truth is that Jews were not architects of US immigration policy in the early 20th century, just as George Soros is not funding immigrants' journeys today. But the linking of anti-Semitic tropes to heated discussions concerning who should be allowed to enter our borders is a conversation we're still stuck in. What happened Saturday was partially the tragic result of a contemporary vision of immigrants and refugees.\n\nIndeed, in the week since the loss of the Pittsburgh 11, President Donald Trump has only escalated his war on immigrants, promising an end to birthright citizenship and sending masses of troops to the border to protect it (even to the death ) from those he preposterously calls \"invaders.\" As such, the nation should use its time in synagogue this weekend and afterward to remember that migrant caravans are not filled with \"some very bad people\"; immigrant families at our borders seeking asylum do not represent \"an invasion of our country!\" Rather they are exercising internationally recognized human rights.\n\nFor more opinion...

El presidente ha argumentado dudosamente que tiene el poder de hacer caso omiso a esa enmienda con un decreto presidencial.\n\nY un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de revelar el anuncio pol\u00edtico nacional m\u00e1s racista en una generaci\u00f3n, Trump prometi\u00f3 restricciones m\u00e1s duras al asilo y puso su atenci\u00f3n a consolidar el poder del Partido Republicano en un viaje a Missouri para apoyar a uno de sus protegidos, Josh Hawley, quien est\u00e1 bien posesionado para reemplazar a la senadora dem\u00f3crata Claire McCaskill.\n\nEl presidente incluso dijo que las tropas estadounidenses que planea enviar a la frontera sur, para enfrentar lo que seg\u00fan \u00e9l es una crisis nacional, podr\u00edan disparar contra miembros de un grupo de migrantes \u2014que actualmente est\u00e1n a cientos de kil\u00f3metros del distancia en M\u00e9xico\u2014 si estos llegan a lanzar piedras a los soldados.\n\n\u201cLos dem\u00f3cratas quieren abrir las fronteras y quieren invitar caravana tras caravana a nuestro pa\u00eds\u201d, dijo Trump euf\u00f3rico, encendiendo a las muchedumbres, que aceptaron con entusiasmo su feroz ret\u00f3rica sobre inmigraci\u00f3n y cantaron \u201c\u00a1Construyan ese muro! \u00a1Construyan ese muro!\u201d en una muestra de la potencia que tiene este tema entre la base del presidente.\n\nLas campa\u00f1as inusualmente distintas para las dos c\u00e1maras del Congreso este a\u00f1o, significan que un mensaje contundente que funciona bien en el Senado en el pa\u00eds de Trump, puede ser contraproducente en la campa\u00f1a para la C\u00e1mara en un territorio m\u00e1s moderado.\n\nPero en el final de los d\u00edas de la campa\u00f1a, el presidente ha escalado los asaltos ret\u00f3ricos contra los inmigrantes indocumentados y contra el grupo de migrantes que viajan hacia el norte, deleitando a los votantes de su base, pero enfureciendo a los republicanos en distritos indecisos, mientras los estrategas republicanos temen por la C\u00e1mara.\n\nEso, y un programa de viajes que parece estar m\u00e1s orientado a que los candidatos republicanos del Senado sobrepasen y derroten a dem\u00f3cratas vulnerables, sugiere que el presidente puede leer las urnas tan bien como cualquier otro.\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los comentaristas se est\u00e1n alejando de las predicciones tras la sorprendente victoria de Trump sobre Hillary Clinton en 2016. Pero una mayor\u00eda de modelos sugiere que el desenlace m\u00e1s probable el martes es que los dem\u00f3cratas se queden con la C\u00e1mara y los republicanos mantengan el control del Senado o incluso que aumenten su mayor\u00eda por un par de curules.\n\nHarry Enten de CNN predice que los dem\u00f3cratas ganar\u00e1n 225 asientos \u2014y la mayor\u00eda en la C\u00e1mara\u2014 mientras que los republicanos solo tendr\u00e1n 210 lugares. Una victoria dem\u00f3crata de 202 asientos o 262 asientos est\u00e1 dentro del margen de error.\n\nLos Republicanos tendr\u00e1n 52 asientos \u2014y mantendr\u00e1n la mayor\u00eda\u2014 en el Senado, mientras que los dem\u00f3cratas solo tendr\u00e1n 48, seg\u00fan el an\u00e1lisis de Enten. El margen de error est\u00e1 entre 48 y 56 lugares para los republicanos.", "(CNN) Manchester City soccer players have clubbed together to fund a new unit at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.\n\nThe English Premier League squad members donated part of their wages to open a new pain distraction unit, according to a statement from the club.\n\nPatients undergoing treatment will be immersed in a virtual-reality world of interactive 3D games and images to distract them from pain.\n\nThe children will wear special 3D glasses that will block out the treatment room.\n\nDelph represented the squad at the opening.\n\nCity player Fabian Delph cut the ribbon on the new unit at an opening ceremony also attended by six soccer-mad patients. Delph later paid a visit to another fan who was too ill to attend the opening.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

He'll say it a hundred times that he feels he didn't hire a woman. He hired a coach. It's that mentality.

Click to subscribe!\n\nTrump is averaging -- AVERAGING -- 30 false or misleading claims a day in the last seven weeks. And, per the Fact Checker, he often of late soars far above that average. As one example: On October 22, when he traveled to Houston to hold a rally for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), Trump, said 83 untrue things in a single day. 83!\n\nThe scope of Trump's falsehoods is literally breathtaking. In the 649 days between his inauguration and October 30, Trump has made 6,420 claims that are partially or entirely false. That includes a number of assertions -- that the Russia probe being overseen by special counsel Robert Mueller is a hoax, that the Trump tax cut was the biggest in history -- that Trump has repeated ad infinitum. He's said the Russia investigation is a hoax or a witch hunt 157 times and claimed his was the biggest tax cut ever 120 times, according to the Fact-Checker .)\n\n(Sidebar: Many people ask why I don't simply refer to Trump's falsehoods as lies. Two reasons in this case: 1) The Post tabulates false or misleading claims and so, when quoting their numbers, I prefer to use their wording for accuracy and 2) As I've explained before , I think we can, and should, call out a lie when we either know or have a reasonable expectation that Trump is aware that something he's saying is false.)\n\nThe sheer number of Trump's deceptions pushes back on his claim to ABC News' Jon Karl that \"I do try ... and I always want to tell the truth.\" The record suggests otherwise.\n\nFacts are, for Trump, fungible things. When they fit his narrative, he is happy to tout them. But they rarely fit his narrative. And when they don't, he has zero concern about creating his own narrative that simply doesn't have any real resemblance to the established truth.\n\nIn fact, as the Fact Checker's numbers make clear, Trump seems to flaunt his fact-less claims -- assuring his supporters that he is telling the \"real\" truth that the media won't let them in on. Trump has turned that tendency toward untruthfulness into a political strategy; he is so politically incorrect that he doesn't even abide by the rules of fact and truth that the so-called \"elites\" think he should.\n\nIt's truly stunning -- and frightening -- stuff. What's more terrifying to me is that Trump's supporters don't seem to know -- or care -- about any of this. They regard fact checks by the media as simply the \"fake news\" doing everything they can to slow down Trump's momentum. And to the extent they acknowledge that Trump doesn't tell the truth a lot of the time, they write it off as either a) him just talking or b) that all politicians lie. (Most politicians do say untrue things from time to time. When called on them, however, they stop saying the false things. Trump is not like that.)\n\nTrump also works aggressively to ensure that his base sees him as the only honest man in the country, the only person who is really telling it like it is.\n\n\"Stick with us,\" he told a VFW crowd in Kansas City back in July. \"Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\"\n\nHere's the thing, though: It is happening. Facts are not a partisan position. And here's one fact no one should forget: Donald Trump is misleading -- and outright lying at times -- at a pace that we have never seen before in politics. Never.", "(CNN) As the 2018 midterm election nears, President Donald Trump is disseminating false and misleading statements at a pace that leaves even his own past prevarications in the dust.\n\nIn the month of October, Trump said 1,104 things that were totally or partially untrue -- more than double his next most prodigious month (September), according to the tireless cataloging by The Washington Post's Fact Checker blog\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics.

Ted Cruz (R), Trump, said 83 untrue things in a single day. 83!\n\nThe scope of Trump's falsehoods is literally breathtaking. In the 649 days between his inauguration and October 30, Trump has made 6,420 claims that are partially or entirely false. That includes a number of assertions -- that the Russia probe being overseen by special counsel Robert Mueller is a hoax, that the Trump tax cut was the biggest in history -- that Trump has repeated ad infinitum. He's said the Russia investigation is a hoax or a witch hunt 157 times and claimed his was the biggest tax cut ever 120 times, according to the Fact-Checker .)\n\n(Sidebar: Many people ask why I don't simply refer to Trump's falsehoods as lies. Two reasons in this case: 1) The Post tabulates false or misleading claims and so, when quoting their numbers, I prefer to use their wording for accuracy and 2) As I've explained before , I think we can, and should, call out a lie when we either know or have a reasonable expectation that Trump is aware that something he's saying is false.)\n\nThe sheer number of Trump's deceptions pushes back on his claim to ABC News' Jon Karl that \"I do try ... and I always want to tell the truth.\" The record suggests otherwise.\n\nFacts are, for Trump, fungible things. When they fit his narrative, he is happy to tout them. But they rarely fit his narrative. And when they don't, he has zero concern about creating his own narrative that simply doesn't have any real resemblance to the established truth.\n\nIn fact, as the Fact Checker's numbers make clear, Trump seems to flaunt his fact-less claims -- assuring his supporters that he is telling the \"real\" truth that the media won't let them in on. Trump has turned that tendency toward untruthfulness into a political strategy; he is so politically incorrect that he doesn't even abide by the rules of fact and truth that the so-called \"elites\" think he should.\n\nIt's truly stunning -- and frightening -- stuff. What's more terrifying to me is that Trump's supporters don't seem to know -- or care -- about any of this. They regard fact checks by the media as simply the \"fake news\" doing everything they can to slow down Trump's momentum. And to the extent they acknowledge that Trump doesn't tell the truth a lot of the time, they write it off as either a) him just talking or b) that all politicians lie. (Most politicians do say untrue things from time to time. When called on them, however, they stop saying the false things. Trump is not like that.)\n\nTrump also works aggressively to ensure that his base sees him as the only honest man in the country, the only person who is really telling it like it is.\n\n\"Stick with us,\" he told a VFW crowd in Kansas City back in July. \"Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\"\n\nHere's the thing, though: It is happening. Facts are not a partisan position. And here's one fact no one should forget: Donald Trump is misleading -- and outright lying at times -- at a pace that we have never seen before in politics. Never.", "Washington (CNN) The uncle of White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said Friday that the Central American migrants seeking asylum are just like his Jewish ancestors who fled Europe and came to the US as refugees before World War II.\n\n\"They are just like our family,\" David Glosser told CNN's Alisyn Camerota in an interview on \"New Day.\" \"We needed to come here.

But waiting for the bus or getting off after school can pose a far greater danger.\n\nThe risk was highlighted this week, as at least five children lost their lives when they were hit by drivers near school bus stops, authorities said. At least seven other children were hurt in bus stop incidents.\n\nOverall, wrecks involving school transportation, including buses, make up a tiny fraction of deadly vehicle incidents -- less than 1% of nearly 325,000 fatal crashes in the US from 2006 to 2015, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data show\n\nBut more than one-third of school-age children who died in those school-transportation-related wrecks -- 102 children -- were on foot when they were killed, including some hit by school buses, the data show. Most of the others were riding in vehicles that were not school buses.\n\nNothing suggests the threat to students waiting for rides to school is rising, and safety experts say the school bus is still the safest way for a child to ride to school.\n\nBut this week's tragedies underscore the need for greater vigilance by pedestrians and motorists, who must be attentive in school bus zones, said Charlie Hood, executive director of the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services, or NASDPTS.\n\nChildren \"are most vulnerable when they are pedestrians,\" he said.\n\nAn 'unfortunately consistent' pattern\n\nIn most states, drivers are required to stop and wait for a stopped school bus with flashing lights and a raised stop arm, except where provisions for multilane highways apply. In at least two incidents this week -- in Indiana, where three siblings were killed , and in Tallahassee , where a kindergartner reportedly was hurt -- police said the bus's stop arm was raised when drivers struck the children.\n\nThat's not unusual. Drivers routinely pass stopped school buses, research shows.\n\nOn a single day during the school year that ended in the spring, 20% of bus drivers reported that nearly 84,000 vehicles passed their buses illegally, according to NASDPTS, which surveyed drivers in 38 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe prior year, a 7-year-old girl who'd exited a school bus in Mississippi was killed by a vehicle that swerved to the right side of the bus while its stop arm and eight-way red lights were activated, the National Association for Pupil Transportation reported\n\nResults of the NASDPTS' annual survey have fluctuated between 75,000 and 85,000 errant vehicles since 2011 in what Hood called an \"unfortunately consistent\" pattern to a seemingly \"intractable\" problem.\n\n\"It's not an easy issue to solve. If it were, the numbers would be going down over the years,\" he said, adding that it's not for lack of trying.\n\nLaw enforcement has ramped up its public education efforts and enforcement of speed limits in school zones, he said. And school bus drivers are doing their part to educate riders on ways to board and exit safely.\n\nCountervailing those efforts, though, could be distracted driving, as people glance at their smartphones while behind the wheel, he said.\n\n\"We don't have any data to quantify why it's happening, but we all know we've seen more distracted driving in recent years,\" Hood said. \"Some people are definitely rushing to get somewhere and blowing past buses. I think a lot of people are just distracted and just don't realize what they're doing.\"\n\n'A safe, clear way for people to walk'\n\nPedestrians can get distracted, too, and that also contributes to vehicle wrecks, said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association.\n\nPedestrian deaths increased by 27% from 2007 to 2016, while all other traffic deaths dropped by 14%, the group reported . It means pedestrians accounted for a larger proportion of traffic fatalities than they had in the prior 33 years.\n\nPoor infrastructure, reckless drivers, distracted drivers and distracted pedestrians contribute to the grim tally, Adkins said.\n\nAlso, more people are walking now, a healthy trend that should prompt community leaders to create safer walking spaces, he said.\n\n\"It's really a wake-up call for parents and communities across the country to look around their schools and neighborhoods and put together a plan,\" he said. \"They need to make sure there's a safe, clear way for people to walk or bike or do a drop-off.\"\n\nEngineering solutions, such as sidewalks, stop lights and pedestrian bridges, help create safe environments for children to wait for buses, said Dr. Benjamin Hoffman, a pediatrics professor at Oregon Health & Science University and an injury prevention specialist.\n\nStreet lights can also help illuminate roads and bus stops to improve visibility, especially during Daylight Saving Time , which ends Sunday, meaning daylight will appear earlier, he said.\n\nEducation programs in schools that teach children when to cross streets and what to look for also are key, Hoffman said. And driver's education and licensing tests should ensure that drivers know rules about when to stop for school buses.", "South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands (CNN) \u2014 With about a thousand locals living on just over eight squares miles of land, the island of South Caicos is a delightfully sleepy Caribbean retreat.\n\nYet this pristine paradise is slowly waking up to its travel potential.\n\nLife unfolds on the water here with livelihoods largely tied to fishing, so it's no surprise that visitor pursuits are also centered on the cobalt Atlantic Ocean to the east and the calm turquoise shallows of the Caicos Banks to the west.\n\nSouth Caicos is one of the eight main islands that make up the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British Overseas Territory located 575 miles southeast of Miami.\n\nThere are just three resorts on South Caicos, two of which have opened since 2016.\n\nThere's nearly nothing in the way of souvenir shopping and only a handful of local restaurants. Rental cars are few and far between. So are people, outside of the main settlement of Cockburn Harbour -- the territory's fishing capital.\n\nOutside town, you're as likely to see donkeys, horses and flamingos as you are to spot other people.\n\nSouth Caicos has welcomed only about 7,500 overnight visitors so far in 2018, according to the Turks and Caicos Islands Tourist Board. By comparison, there were more than 415,000 visitor arrivals last year at the international airport in nearby Providenciales and more than 830,000 cruise visitor arrivals at the port in Grand Turk.\n\nRelaxed luxury\n\nBut there are big plans afoot for South Caicos.\n\nEast Bay Resort , with 86 beachfront suites and 16 traditional rooms, opened at the beginning of 2016 along a 1.5-mile stretch of white sand beach.\n\nIn January 2017, Sailrock Resort opened its doors, bringing a new level of accommodation to South Caicos.\n\nThe laid-back luxury resort -- centered around a ridgetop Great House, complete with infinity pool, gourmet restaurant and bar -- is just the first phase of a much larger plan to develop South Caicos in its low-density, eco-friendly image.\n\nSailrock is proud of the relaxed privacy it offers guests.\n\n\"I've actually had people say to me, 'we were the only guests at the resort,' when I fully well know that there were 28 people here,\" said Matt Bywater, Sailrock's executive director.\n\nA gradually expanding property, the resort currently offers 29 units -- from airy multi-bedroom beachfront villas with private pools to ridgetop suites with panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean and Caicos Banks.\n\nThe two bodies of water also afford the resort two beaches, and the Cove Restaurant + Beach Bar overlooking Caicos Banks provides a second on-site dining option.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nSnorkeling, guided paddleboard and kayak tours, airboat bonefishing charters and offshore fishing charters are among the experiences offered at Sailrock.\n\nThe island is home to three national parks and reserves and offers spectacular reefs for snorkeling and diving. While there are currently no dive operators on South Caicos, Sailrock can arrange excursions through off-island operators until local outfitters are up and running.\n\nBell Sound and waters to the north of the island are excellent for bonefishing. The local small-scale fishing industry revolves around conch, lobster, grouper, snapper and more.\n\nGuests can also take a more languid approach to vacationing, lounging by the water with a cocktail in hand. Massage treatments are currently available, with a full spa slated to open in 2019.\n\nThe spa will offer signature salt scrub treatments in a nod to South Caicos' key role in the Turks and Caicos Islands' now-defunct salt industry.\n\nIts sheltered natural deep water harbor made South Caicos attractive for the production and export of sea salt, an industry that began in the Turks and Caicos in the 17th century.\n\nThe salt was produced by evaporating sea water in shallow ponds toward the center of the island. The industry ground to a halt in South Caicos in the 1960s, but many of the ponds are still visible today and are frequent gathering spots for delicate pink flamingos.\n\nBoiling Hole, an underwater tidal cave that fed the salt ponds, serves as a reminder of the once-thriving industry. Donkeys and horses -- descendants of the animals used in salt production -- still roam the island.\n\nRelated content North and Middle Caicos: The unspoiled Caribbean\n\nNatural assets\n\nThe reefs surrounding South Caicos offer excellent diving and snorkeling. Courtesy Sailrock Resort\n\nSailrock's own history starts with salt. In addition to the central resort, Sailrock Development Limited has long-term plans for additional hotels, a golf course, overwater bungalows and a collection of residential neighborhoods , with Peninsula homes starting around $750,000.\n\nMuch of the land held by the company -- 2,400 acres or about 3.75 square miles -- was purchased in the mid-2000s from salt company heirs decades after the business died out.\n\nA key part of the vision for development in South Caicos is \"blending it in with the existing beauty of the island,\" according to Scott Hoskins, president of sales and marketing for Sailrock.\n\n\"It's unspoiled. It really gives you that level of seclusion ... that authenticity that you don't normally see in a lot of other Caribbean destinations.\" The community is a key piece of that, Hoskins said.\n\nSome residents, called Belongers, are pleased to see change on South Caicos.\n\n\"I'm happy to see that we are moving ahead,\" said Darell Forbes, chef and owner of the popular Sunset Caf\u00e9 in Cockburn Harbour. \"This have always been a dream to me, and probably to many of our native people, to see South Caicos move ahead. So we embrace this opportunity.\"\n\nRelated content Puppies and island paradise: A winning vacation combo\n\nOthers are taking more of a wait-and-see approach, as there is some skepticism about how integrated Sailrock developments will ultimately be with the rest of the island.\n\nFor their part, Sailrock leaders say they're committed to doing right by South Caicos.\n\n\"We're not going to forget about the community. The community is the foundation of South Caicos. That's what makes it special. The town, the people,\" said Bywater.\n\n\"We're just here trying to develop the island a little bit. But we know where the island started and we're not looking to change that culture.\"\n\nRestoration and improved infrastructure\n\nSome of Cockburn Harbour's historic buildings are slated to be refurbished. Courtesy Sailrock Resort\n\nSailrock has joined the Turks and Caicos government in pledging $4 million toward restoring historic structures in Cockburn Harbour and revitalizing the Queen's Parade Grounds, the waterfront site of Queen Elizabeth's visit to South Caicos in 1966.\n\nCockburn Harbour sustained extensive damage from hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. Sailrock formed the South Caicos Heritage Foundation to provide supplies to repair and replace more than 100 damaged roofs in the community, and the foundation has more initiatives planned for 2019, Hoskins said.\n\nA picturesque Anglican church, a harbor and fish processing facilities, some vacant buildings associated with the salt industry, small all-purpose grocery stores, a few local eateries and modest homes make up the town, where the majority of locals live.\n\nOutside the sleepy settlement, the South Caicos airport has a new runway and control tower, and there are plans for a new terminal.\n\nThe current terminal building is a very laid-back affair with a bar serving soda, beer and snacks and a dozen or so chairs for departing passengers.\n\nThere are 20-minute, inter-island flights from Providenciales to South Caicos on interCaribbean Airways . South Caicos is also accessible via passenger ferry a couple times a week.\n\nThings slow down as soon as you set foot on the island. And the South Caicos welcome will be warm and friendly, Sunset Caf\u00e9's Forbes said.\n\n\"You know, we haven't changed our culture in terms of our hospitality and our way of life.\"", "(CNN) They were just kids, trying to get to school.\n\nAt least five children have been killed this week and seven injured when they were hit by drivers near school bus stops, authorities said.

El jefe de la Agencia Nacional de B\u00fasqueda y Rescate de Indonesia, Muhammad Syauqi Syauqi, dijo que su equipo no hab\u00eda escuchado pings de la grabadora de voz de la cabina. Se cree que est\u00e1 en el lecho marino, a unos 35 metros de la superficie, oculto por escombros u oculto por el lodo.\n\nCondiciones dif\u00edciles\n\nEn condiciones ideales, dijeron los analistas, los investigadores tratar\u00edan de documentar el posicionamiento de la aeronave y sus partes en el agua, para que puedan determinar la causa del impacto antes de que se levante el avi\u00f3n. Pero en Indonesia, los buzos est\u00e1n luchando contra condiciones traicioneras, incluidas las corrientes en r\u00e1pido movimiento y las aguas fangosas.\n\n\"La medida prudente en este caso es retirarlo del fondo del oc\u00e9ano, ya que es demasiado peligroso analizarlo en el momento en que se encuentra\", dijo Thomas.\n\nSi el fuselaje del avi\u00f3n se hubiera encontrado intacto, los dispositivos de flotabilidad se habr\u00edan utilizado para elevar el cuerpo del avi\u00f3n y provocar un da\u00f1o m\u00ednimo. Pero Thomas dijo que el avi\u00f3n est\u00e1 tan destrozado \"que encontrarlo o hacerle m\u00e1s da\u00f1o ahora es casi incidental\".\n\nEs probable que la recuperaci\u00f3n de estos art\u00edculos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os se haga a mano o con redes, dijo David Soucie, un analista de seguridad de la aviaci\u00f3n para CNN.\n\nUn gran desaf\u00edo para los buceadores ser\u00e1 identificar y separar cualquier parte del cuerpo del avi\u00f3n de otros escombros. \"Si miras el aislamiento y los respaldos de los asientos, los cojines de los asientos pueden confundirse f\u00e1cilmente con partes del fuselaje y viceversa\", dijo Soucie.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de buscar la grabadora de voz de la cabina, los buzos buscar\u00e1n pistas en los escombros que podr\u00edan indicar en qu\u00e9 estado se encontraba el avi\u00f3n cuando se estrell\u00f3.\n\n\"Digamos que est\u00e1 el tren de aterrizaje y tal vez a 3,2 kil\u00f3metros de distancia encuentras otras piezas del avi\u00f3n que son pesadas, como motores y ese tipo de cosas, entonces sospechar\u00edan que hubo una ruptura del avi\u00f3n durante el vuelo, en lugar de un s\u00f3lido impacto del avi\u00f3n en una sola pieza\", dijo.\n\nSoucie dijo que debido a la magnitud del da\u00f1o, parece que el vuelo de Lion Air sufri\u00f3 una \"explosi\u00f3n hidr\u00e1ulica\" cuando golpe\u00f3 el agua. Esto significa que en el impacto, el aire presurizado golpea el agua y hace que el fuselaje se rompa.\n\n\"Tienes que pensar en que esta cosa golpee el agua a 643 kil\u00f3metros por hora o m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y se detenga repentinamente\", dijo Soucie. \"Has escuchado a la gente decir que el agua es como el concreto cuando buceas desde 30 metros de altura, as\u00ed que puedes imaginarte c\u00f3mo ser\u00eda a 643 kil\u00f3metros por hora. Es dif\u00edcil describir el tipo de da\u00f1o que ocurren con eso\".", "Photos: 'Jersey Shore' cast: Where are they now?

Every family's kimchi recipe is different, but Kim Hyun-a, one of the Seoul Kimchi Festival's organizers, says there are some key distinctions from the southern version.\n\n\"Because the weather in North Korea is cold, it's hard to ferment things,\" said Kim. \"So there are kimchi in North Korea that use sugar in them to help the fermentation process.\"\n\nRelated content 10 of South Korea's most delicious dishes\n\n\"Most Kimchi in North Korea doesn't include salted seafood, unlike kimchi in South Korea. Kimchi in North Korea is sweeter and lighter in taste. It has a cleaner taste. It uses less chili powder.\"\n\nThe dish's debut at the three-day charity event, now in its fifth year, is a highly important part of the recent reconciliation between the two Koreas, said Kim.\n\n\"I think it is very meaningful at this time to show North Korean kimchi to Seoul citizens,\" he added.\n\nSeoul City Mayor Park Won-son agrees. He says recent meetings between North and South Korean leaders had raised the culinary significance.\n\n\"I went to Pyongyang recently with the presidents' summit, so at that time I had tasted the North Korean kimchi.

It was the worst anti-Semitic attack in American history, with 11 killed overall. Each of the three Jewish congregations that meet at Tree of Life synagogue lost at least one member.\n\n\"My holy place has been defiled,\" Myers' said Sunday, echoing the Prophet Ezekiel\n\nNow, Myers wonders why God would put him in Pittsburgh, where he landed his first job as a rabbi at Tree of Life/Or L'Simcha a little more than a year ago. He wonders if he could have done more to save his flock. He hears the screams of Bernice Simon as her husband of more than 60 years was shot before her eyes, and then he hears her silence.\n\nWhen he lies awake at night, the rabbi thinks of Psalm 23, which begins, \"The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.\"\n\n\"Well, God, I want!\" he said at an interfaith service Sunday in Pittsburgh, channeling the grief and anger of many Americans. \"What I want, you can't give me. You can't return these 11 beautiful souls.\"\n\nLater, Myers recalled how Psalm 23 concludes, with gratitude for a \"cup that runs over,\" and he thought about the outpouring of support that has flowed from hundreds of texts, emails and social-media messages.\n\nTo watch Myers under the media's klieg lights this week, explaining Jewish mourning rituals to President Donald Trump and the first lady, answering questions from countless journalists, or counseling a grieving nation, is to wonder at his composure and apparent kindness. His sheer mensch-iness.\n\nAs the week wears on, Myers is again preparing for the Sabbath, planning to lead services Friday night and a \"unity service\" on Saturday, one week after the shooting, bringing together survivors from the three congregations that worshipped at the Tree of Life.\n\nFriends and former colleagues say they are impressed but not surprised by Myers' spiritual stamina.\n\n\"He's shouldering the responsibility, but I also know that deep down he is overwhelmed by the events and still doing amazingly well,\" said Rabbi Aaron Gaber, who worked alongside Myers for seven years at Congregation Beth Judah in Ventnor City, New Jersey. \"I am in awe.\"\n\nBut when Myers talks about Psalm 23, it's hard not to think about the middle of David's ancient song.\n\nBetween the shepherding Lord and the overflowing cup lies a valley dark with death , the psalmist says. And even for a rabbi who encourages his flock to find the little joys amid life's sorrows , these must be very dark days.\n\n\"I'm running on empty,\" Myers said in a brief email message.\n\nThe 'Kiddush Club'\n\nGrowing up in Newark, New Jersey, Myers heard a call to join the clergy from a young age, when the cantor of his local synagogue introduced him to the intricacies of Jewish liturgy.\n\nWhen that cantor had a stroke, Myers stepped in to conduct the congregation's choir, though he was just 15, he told the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle\n\nIn Judaism, the cantor, or hazzan in Hebrew, leads the congregation in singing, sometimes composing new melodies to accompany ancient prayers. In the 20th century, cantors could become as famous as opera singers among American Jews. Today, many cantors also take charge of a congregation's youth education programs, as Myers often did.\n\nAfter graduating from Rutgers University and the Jewish Theological Seminary, he returned to his love of sacred singing, even if his wife, Janice, sometimes wondered at his passion for the arcane art.\n\n\"Mine is a sacred calling,\" he said at his farewell celebration at Congregation Beth Judah in 2017, \"and although Janice will sometimes ask me, 'Do you have to answer the call?' I cannot put God's call to voice mail.\"\n\nThough Myers took his divine call seriously, he is not a brow-furrowed zealot, Gaber said. After prayers on Shabbat, he would invite fellow worshippers to join his \" Kiddush Club,\" where the only price of admittance was a willingness to sip a nip of Scotch on a Saturday morning.\n\n\"Everyone was invited to have a shot of Scotch and enjoy themselves,\" Gaber said. \"That's how he is. He creates a lot of joy.\"\n\nMyers' tenure at Congregation Beth Judah ended on a sad note, though, when the congregation merged with another synagogue, as many others have in the face of declining religious observance among American Jews.\n\nBeth Judah let him go last year, according to Jewish Voices New Jersey , a newspaper. At his farewell party, Myers thanked everyone from the synagogue's maintenance man to his children, Aaron and Rachel. Most of all, he thanked the people he sang for.\n\n\"Thank you to you, my congregants,\" he said, \"for the opportunity to represent you to God in prayer.\"\n\nWhile he was at Congregation Beth Judah, Myers quietly became ordained as a rabbi, figuring it could expand his job prospects. It did. Tree of Life/Or L'Simcha hired Myers a few months after he left Congregation Beth Judah.\n\n'A stronger tree'\n\nAt his installation ceremony at Tree of Life, Myers opened with a joke: A rabbi finds a box in the attic, which his wife tells him not to open.\n\nOvercome by curiosity, the rabbi pries open the box, finding three eggs and $2,000.\n\nThe rabbi's wife told him that she put an egg in the box for every bad sermon the rabbi delivered. \"In 20 years, only three bad sermons? That's not bad,\" the rabbi said.\n\nUm, yeah, the rabbi's wife said, except that every time the box filled with a dozen eggs, she sold them for a dollar.\n\nAfter the joke, Myers turned serious.\n\nAmerican Judaism is changing, he told members of his new congregation, and, in order to survive, they would have to change as well. They would have to find new ways to reach a rapidly diversifying country.\n\n\"This voyage may indeed be treacherous, with storms along the way, but it also holds the promise of clear, calm waters and beautiful vistas,\" he said. He even donned a captain's hat to demonstrate his willingness to head the ship, according to a transcript of the speech\n\nTree of Life will now be noted for a different, tragic reason. Already, it has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews and other well-wishers around the world. Meanwhile, Myers said, the \"hard work of healing\" still lies ahead.\n\n\"We will rebuild to be a stronger tree, offering a new light,\" the rabbi said at last Sunday's interfaith vigil. \"People will come and say, 'Wow, that's how you're supposed to live your life.' \"\n\nThe audience clapped, and then the rabbi began to sing. The song was a mourner's lament.", "(CNN) Rumors of a possible return to politics by David Cameron, the former UK prime minister who failed to persuade voters to remain in the EU, have sparked bemusement among opposition Labour MPs, who urged him to stay in the political wilderness.\n\nCameron resigned as Prime Minister and as a Conservative MP in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016.\n\nBut now, according to a report in The Sun newspaper, he is ready to return to the front benches, telling friends he would consider a place in a future Tory cabinet without current Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\n\"David is dedicated to public service and has often said he wouldn't rule out a public role one day, domestically or internationally,\" a source told The Sun. \"But he is only 52, and still a young man.\"\n\nAngela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, tweeted:\n\nRead More", "London (CNN) Jewish communities across the UK are set to stand together with Pittsburgh by backing the #ShowupforShabbat campaign.\n\nAnd the UK Jewish community is rallying to show solidarity, with communal bodies urging people to attend services on Friday night and Saturday morning, the first Shabbat since last weekend's attack.\n\nJessica Weinberg Neiss, who attended the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh before moving to London just over two months ago, told CNN she had been overwhelmed by the community's support.\n\nShabbat Shalom to everyone, particularly the people of Pittsburgh still coming to terms with the awful tragedy of last weekend #ShowUpForShabbat pic.twitter.com/G9QK4SSS8t \u2014 Board of Deputies of British Jews (@BoardofDeputies) November 2, 2018\n\n\"It's wonderful to see people come out in support of Pittsburgh but also in support of other Jews,\" she said.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Exxon's ( XOM ) bottom line enjoyed a $2.6 billion boost from a spike in oil prices relative to the prior year.\n\nExxon's cash flow from operating activities climbed to a four-year high of $11.1 billion. That signals a much-needed improvement after Exxon's balance sheet came under pressure during the crash in oil prices that began in 2014. Exxon lost its AAA credit rating in 2016 after 67 years.\n\nExxon showed some glimmers of hope on the production front, a recent sore spot given the spike in US oil output. The company's global oil output inched slightly higher to 2.3 million barrels per day. It had been down in eight of the prior nine quarters.\n\nThat growth was led by an acceleration in American production growth to 11%. Exxon is now producing 555,000 barrels of oil in the United States each day.\n\nExxon pointed to new contributions from the Permian Basin, the shale hotspot that has made the United States the world leader in production. While Exxon was late to the shale boom, it spent $5.6 billion in early 201 7 to buy assets in the Permian. Those bets are starting to pay off. Exxon said it has ramped up to 38 rigs in the Permian.\n\n\"We expect to continue to increase volumes over time as we ramp up activity in the Permian and new projects start up,\" Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Exxon's overall oil and gas output declined 2% from the prior year, led lower by shrinking natural gas volumes. European gas output tumbled 24%. Exxon's total production has only increased once in the past 10 quarters.\n\nExxon rival Chevron is growing much faster. Chevron revealed on Friday that its total oil and gas production increased by 9% last quarter to a record high. Oil output jumped 25%, led of course by the Permian Basin.", "(CNN) Bitcoin may have turned 10 years old but its continued drop in value is hardly cause for celebration.\n\nOn Thursday, the price of one bitcoin was down to about $6,320.\n\nIts price has droppeddramatically since its all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017. The cryptocurrency started the year at just under $13,500 and has been down ever since.\n\nAlthough bitcoin's infamous price rise launched it into the mainstream last year, it's hardly a new concept. Wednesday marked the 10th anniversary of a white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto that detailed for the first time how bitcoin could work.\n\nIt was published on a cryptocurrency mailing list shortly after the start of the financial crisis in 2008. The concept, which is an alternative to fiat currencies such as the US dollar, served as a way for people to exchange money without a regulatory middle man.\n\nNakamoto described how new bitcoins coins could be created through a process called mining, which requires powerful computers that solve complex math problems. Months after the white paper published, Nakamoto mined the first block of bitcoin, which generated 50 bitcoins.\n\nLittle is known about the creator. Nakamoto is a pseudonym \u2014 and even a decade later, it's still unclear who exactly that is.\n\nBut the publication of the paper was a groundbreaking moment. According to Maya Kumar, an executive who oversees the UK and Ireland operations at Luno, an app that helps users buy bitcoin, it paved the way for the next phase in the evolution of money.\n\n\"The invention of bitcoin and the underlying blockchain [that supports it] has allowed us all to reimagine money,\" Kumar told CNN Business. \"We are seeing a new parallel financial system being built in real time.\"\n\nBitcoin relies on cryptography, which uses hidden codes to communicate. Users can make transactions directly under pseudonyms, taking away power from banks and governments, and it is not controlled by a central authority.\n\nFor bitcoin, each problem takes about 10 minutes to solve and creates a predetermined number of coins. The number that is awarded for solving each problem dwindles as time goes on.\n\nNakamoto's system only allows a fixed number of coins to be created \u2014 there's a limit of 21 million bitcoins that can ever be generated.\n\nBitcoin rang in its 10th birthday with continued volatility.\n\nEiland Glover, the CEO of coin company Kowala, said this fixed number will limit bitcoin's future.\n\n\"There can only ever be so many bitcoin supplied so if demand grows and you have a limited number, there's deflation and volatility,\" Glover said.\n\nHis company and others are attempting to create more stable coins that are tied to the US dollar \u2014 a move he believes will make the value of the coins less volatile.\n\nGlover calls Nakamoto's white paper \"the most essential foundational paper\" but he notes how people have been trying to improve it.\n\nclandestine and illegal transactions. Over time, it gained broader adoption. Bitcoin's early adopters sometimes tried to makeclandestine and illegal transactions. Over time, it gained broader adoption.\n\nIn 2014, Overstock became the first major US retailer to accept bitcoin. Companies such as Expedia and Microsoft followed, and now even Starbucks wants to find a way to let customers use bitcoin to pay for their caffeine fixes.\n\nBitcoin is far from the only cryptocurrency available. From ether and litecoin to even cryptokitties, there are more than 1,500 options. But bitcoin is the oldest, biggest and most popular.\n\nAlthough supply and demand play a role in its volatility, so does hype from news coverage. For example, the news of a cryptocurrency exchange hack can cause prices to drop, while the potential of tighter regulation leads to a boost.\n\nBut bitcoin's growing popularity and entrance into the mainstream suggest the coin isn't going anywhere anytime soon, according to multiple experts. Stability is needed for any digital currency to succeed.\n\nFor now, we'll see how bitcoin evolves as a teen.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

During a brief appearance before heading to a rally in West Virginia, Trump said the 250,000 figure was \"shocking for a lot of people.\"\n\n\"That was a tremendous number by any standards,\" Trump said. \"And that's despite the hurricanes.

Year to date, the deficit is now 10.1% larger in 2018 than it was over the same period in 2017.\n\nThe year-over-year percentage growth in average hourly earnings looks slightly larger than it actually is because wages declined last October as low-wage workers returned to their jobs following a particularly strong hurricane season. But economists said it's still encouraging, as the pay increase remains well above the inflation rate, meaning that workers' pay is actually raising their standard of living.\n\nSome of the strong payrolls growth came from a slight downward revision to September's number, but overall it lifts the average over the past 12 months to 211,000.\n\nThe continued pace of job growth is unusual at this point in an economic recovery, and shows that there are still enough workers coming off the sidelines as opportunities improve to supply at least a portion of businesses' labor needs. The civilian labor force participation rate for workers between ages 25 and 54, which measures the percentage of the population that is working or looking for work, jumped to its highest level since May 2010.\n\nMost of the net new jobs came from health care, construction, and manufacturing, which has added 296,000 jobs over the past year. Although the purchasing managers index for manufacturing fell in October to the lowest level since April, indicating slowing demand, the employment report is an an indication that tariffs on imported aluminum and steel haven't negatively impacted hiring in factories thus far.\n\nRetail hiring showed no growth on a seasonally adjusted basis.\n\nThe strong numbers should reassure Federal Reserve officials that they're clear to keep raising interest rates, as they approach the \"neutral\" rate at which monetary policy is pressing neither the accelerator or the brake on economic growth.\n\nThe question remains, however, whether the Fed will stop there \u2014 or keep hiking, in order to cool things down.", "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) \u2014 For some folks, flying on a brand new airliner is almost as exciting as riding in a spanking new car.\n\nSo get ready air travel fans: Beginning in January, travelers in the USA will get to fly on the first newly designed large single-aisle airliner in nearly three decades.\n\nDelta Air Lines, the world's second largest carrier, unveiled its new Airbus A220-100 during a ceremony Monday at its headquarters at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\nWith the roar of jet engines in the background, excited employees lined up to tour Ship 8101, as Delta named it, the first of 75 A220s that Delta is expected to bring into its fleet over the next two to three years.\n\nSWISS, Korean Air and airBaltic already fly these jets, but Delta will be the first carrier in the US. Taking the stage at the celebration, Delta CEO Ed Bastian welcomed the A220 as \"a beautiful new member of the family.\"\n\nThis $81-million jet has racked up several firsts:\n\n-- It's the first Airbus airliner designed and built by another company \u2014 Canada's Bombardier.\n\n-- It's the first single-aisle airliner to have super-strong, lightweight, non-metal wings made with a special process called resin transfer injection -- squirting carbon fiber resin inside the wing skin. (This matters because carbon fiber wings have fewer rivets than metal wings. They slip through the air more smoothly, and they need less maintenance.)\n\n-- It's the first single-aisle commercial airliner with electric brakes instead of typical hydraulic brakes. (No more leaky hydraulic brake lines equals less maintenance.)\n\nDelta plans to use the A220 as part of a fleet modernization program. Some airplanes on Delta's domestic routes are more than three decades old, with retro-fitted passenger seat power ports and no in-flight entertainment systems.\n\n\"The simple idea is to provide customers what it is they tell us they want,\" said Delta Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Tim Mapes. \"That means space, innovative technology and comfort. All of those things are evident in this plane.\"\n\nThe A220s, along with about 100 other new jets, will replace 20% of older, less-efficient aircraft by 2020, according to Delta . The airline also plans to replace 25% of its domestic fleet over the next three years, Bastian said, \"taking delivery of more airplanes than at any time in our history.\"\n\nOne reason behind this move is a massive projected increase in passengers.\n\nLast year, worldwide air passenger traffic crossed 4 billion for the first time, up 7.3% from 2016, according to the International Air Transport Association . By 2036, that number is expected to nearly double.\n\nIn the US, about 965 million passengers flew commercial airlines last year, an increase of more than 3%, according to the Department of Transportation . By 2036, the industry predicts the number of passengers in the US will exceed a billion.\n\nAirlines are looking to meet that need with the help of a new generation of jets designed to offer creature comforts travelers want while keeping profits strong. The Airbus A220-100 is one of those new jets.\n\nSeats\n\nOnce you step aboard this plane, you immediately notice it just feels bigger than a typical single-aisle airliner. Nearly 7-foot-high ceilings and windows larger than many other kinds of jets.\n\nThe cabin is a spacious 10-feet, seven-inches wide.\n\nDelta has designed its A220-100s to seat 109 passengers \u2014 including 12 in first class, 15 in premium economy and 82 in economy. Up front, first class seats are in a 2-2 configuration with head rests and other accoutrements, including water bottle holders and adjustable arm rests.\n\nDelta's new A220 seats 109 passengers in three classes -- all with seat-back in-flight entertainment screens. Thom Patterson/CNN\n\nIn Economy, travelers may like the seat width \u2014 measuring 18.6 inches \u2014 the widest main cabin seats in Delta's fleet. If you're wondering about leg room in coach, the seat pitch ranges from 30 to 32 inches. Delta's Boeing 717s, which seat about the same number of passengers, have a seat pitch of 31 inches in economy\n\nAnother reason the main cabin feels big is the 2-3 seat configuration.\n\nThat means fewer middle seats -- which is great news if you hate that \"trapped feeling\" some folks get when they're in a middle seat.\n\nIf you're in a window seat, you've got a bit more shoulder room, thanks to cleverly designed indentations in the cabin walls. For the window shades, this plane went old school. No push-button electronic dimmers required. Just your typical pull-down window shades will do fine, thank you very much.\n\nDelta's A220 also offers full LED spectrum lighting, so crew members can change the color and brightness of the interior light based on various moods throughout the day.\n\nIn-flight entertainment\n\nMain cabin seats will include seat-back screens for in-flight entertainment. In first class, the A220 offers the largest seatback in-flight entertainment screens in Delta's fleet.\n\nThe jet's Wi-FI uses a 2Ku satellite system, which Mapes said is the fastest in the fleet. It's designed to provide around 70-100 megabits per second, he said, \"which will allow anybody to do what they need.\"\n\nIn first class, the A220 offers the largest seatback in-flight entertainment screens in Delta's fleet. Thom Patterson/CNN\n\nA deep library of TV and movies is available on any of the large seatback screens on each seat. Delta's rival, American Airlines, has been moving away from seatback screens and instead requiring passengers to use their own devices to stream in-flight entertainment.\n\nRestroom with a view\n\nTraveling with small children is pretty common, so it's nice to see airliner restrooms are getting more family friendly. The lavatories on this plane are large enough to change babies -- and a pullout baby-changing table is available in the right rear restroom. They're also large enough for a 6-foot-plus-tall person to stand up straight -- which isn't always the case on other jets.\n\nThere are three lavatories on this plane. Remarkably, one of them has something you don't see very often in airliner restrooms: a window.\n\nDelta Air Lines' new A220 includes a room with a view. Delta Air Lines\n\n\"The engineers saw an opportunity to put one in and we said 'go for it,'\" said Bastian.\n\nIt's hard to know if the window will result in longer waits for the restroom, because passengers will be inside snapping photos.\n\nRoutes\n\nThe jet can fly nearly 3,400 miles, so Delta says it plans to use it for direct routes to cities that don't usually fill larger planes.\n\nIf you have plans to fly from New York to Dallas-Ft. Worth or to Houston, Delta is hoping you'll take notice. Those are two of the first routes the airline plans for these new jets beginning in January and April, respectively\n\nBy the way, it's no coincidence that those two cities are dominated by Delta's competitors, United Airlines and American Airlines. Will the A220 allow Delta to give United and American a run for their money in these markets?\n\n\"Pretty good chance of it,\" says Richard Aboulafia, aviation industry analyst at Teal Group.\n\nThe A220 also helps increase profits by saving fuel. Airbus says it's 20% more fuel efficient than similar sized jets.\n\nThe A220's weird history\n\nBut for many aviation enthusiasts, the weirdest thing about the A220 is the fact that for the first time in Airbus's nearly half-century-long history, it's selling a plane designed and built by another company.\n\nHow did that happen?\n\nBefore that, the plane -- and its larger version -- actually had different names -- the CS100 and CS300. Airbus simply renamed them the A220-100 and A220-300.\n\n\"A truly shocking moment,\" said Aboulafia. \"You can't write this stuff in a novel, no one would believe it.\"\n\nTwo of these Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines help the A220-100 achieve 20% more fuel savings than similar jets. Thom Patterson/CNN\n\nExperts say Bombardier was driven to make the deal because they feared the Trump administration's trade policies with Canada would sink the company.\n\n\"Bombardier simply said, if we keep going with this program on our own, it's doomed and it will drag us down with it,\" Aboulafia said. \"So by giving it to our arch rival, Airbus, then they can rescue it and at least we can build structures for it.\"\n\n\"Airbus has spent the past ten years trying to kill this jet \u2014 and now it gets it for free,\" he said.\n\nMore new jets\n\nOf the four major US carriers, American Airlines boasts the youngest fleet. Its planes are an average of 10.5 years old, according to airfleets.net . Delta's fleet is the oldest -- averaging 16.3 years.\n\nBut that statistic will likely begin to change next year when Delta accepts delivery of new Airbus A330neos . These fuel-saving twin-engine widebodies will be used for medium haul trans-Atlantic routes and flights connecting Asia with the US West Coast.\n\nDelta plans to add new Airbus A330neos to its fleet next year. Thom Patterson/CNN\n\nAnother jet -- Boeing's super-efficient 777-9X -- is expected to make its first test flight next year. That plane \u2014 expected to be the world's largest twin-engine jet \u2014 will have an all-metal body, but its wings will be made from light-weight, super strong carbon fiber composite material.\n\nCathay Pacific, Lufthansa and Emirates are among several international airlines that have ordered the 777-9X.\n\nAlso next year, Boeing is widely expected to announce its plans to build a new midsized airliner \u2014 which has already been unofficially nicknamed the 797", "(CNN) Vice President Mike Pence made a joke Thursday in Georgia that was meant to send a message -- and he got a message right back.\n\nPence visited the state to campaign for Republican gubernatorial candidate and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp.\n\nHis trip also coincided with one by media titan Oprah Winfrey, who was in metro Atlanta to campaign for Kemp's opponent, former state House Minority Leader and Democrat Stacey Abrams.\n\nIn addition to Winfrey, Abrams has also attracted some other star power, including actor Will Ferrell, who recently went door-to-door to campaign for the candidate.\n\nPence took note of these celebrities in a speech and also tweeted about it.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Give Laura Ingraham an inadvertent assist on \"Shut Up and Dribble,\" a three-part Showtime documentary whose title directly quotes the Fox News host, before proceeding to recount the history of athletes -- and especially NBA players -- speaking out on issues. It's a lesson one would hope isn't necessary, but with athletes passing on trips to the White House, that's obviously not the current state of play.\n\nLeBron James was among the targets of Ingraham's ire for criticizing President Trump, and the Lakers star -- who has become increasingly busy as an entertainment mogul -- serves as a producer here, working with, among others, Gotham Chopra, who also directed \"Kobe Bryant's Muse.\"\n\nFormer ESPN anchor Jemele Hill wrote and narrates the documentary, which begins with Bill Russell, who became player-coach of the Boston Celtics at a time when the league still sought to restrict the number of African-Americans on rosters. The film proceeds to document activism into the '60s -- when players rallied around Muhammad Ali's anti-war stance, in a summit organized by football star Jim Brown -- through today, including Colin Kaepernick's silent protest and the Golden State Warriors skipping the traditional post-championship presidential visit.\n\nThat is, admittedly, a lot of ground to cover, and even at nearly three hours \"Shut Up and Dribble\" invariably has a somewhat arbitrary feel to it. Still, the big inflection points paint a cohesive picture -- namely, that sports has never been divorced from politics and what's happening outside the arena, despite efforts to dismiss and diminish the players.\n\nJulius Erving in 'Shut Up and Dribble'\n\nIn one of the more interesting detours, it's noted that Michael Jordan wouldn't cooperate with the film, which recounts his reluctance to wade in on political matters. Jordan famously resisted calls to endorse an African-American candidate, Harvey Gantt, engaged in a competitive North Carolina Senate race against Jesse Helms in 1990, reportedly saying, \"Republicans buy sneakers too\" -- since described as an off-hand reference to his Nike endorsement deal, which nevertheless became a source of criticism.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) Walmart bought Jet.com two years ago to draw younger and wealthier shoppers in big cities. Now, Walmart is positioning Jet as a home for the premium brands it could never offer.\n\nOver the past week, Blue Apron, Nike, and Bonobos all began selling on Jet. Walmart acquired Bonobos last year , but it doesn't directly sell the trendy men's clothing brand at supercenters or on its flagship website to preserve Bonobos' cachet.\n\nWalmart ( WMT ) has built its reputation as the discount mega store for low-and-middle income America.

An elderly local confirmed that there used to be an island in the vicinity, according to Asahi Shimbun, but it can no longer be seen from land or from nearby boats.\n\nA Japan Coast Guard vessel patrols the Northern Territories east of the 'disappeared' islet. Issei Kato/REUTERS\n\nHowever, other fishermen said that Esanbehanakitakojima shows up as an islet on navigation systems.\n\nAuthorities are concerned about its whereabouts as the islet is used to mark Japanese territorial waters in the Northern Territories, an area that is also claimed by Russia.

demarcate its waters.\n\nBeneath the waves?\n\nAccording to international law, nations can only claim waters around islands that are visible above the sea surface at high tide.\n\nA 1987 survey showed that Esanbehanakitakojima protruded 1.4 meters above sea level, and a 1988 sea chart from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan described it as an islet.\n\n\"There is a possibility that the islet has been eroded by wind and snow and, as a result, disappeared,\" Tomoo Fujii, a senior coast guard official, told Asahi Shimbun.\n\nIf Esanbehanakitakojima has sunk beneath the waves, Japan

Civil Liberties Union of Kansas filed a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of a young Latino voter and the League of United Latin American Citizens after elections officials moved the only polling site for the city's 27,000 residents from its historic downtown to the outskirts of the southwest Kansas city due to upcoming construction.\n\nFord County Clerk Deborah Cox notified registered voters of the change in the polling location on September 28.\n\nACLU attorneys urged US District Judge Daniel Crabtree to consider ordering Ford County officials to open a second polling place downtown.

The Vendee Globe is almost gladiatorial -- half a million people turn up at the start, probably because they don't think you're coming back.\n\n\"This one I don't think about not coming back. I think about drinking rum in the Caribbean in a few weeks. It's a different challenge, but it's not a leisure cruise.

He has an alarm clock wired to a klaxon to wake him up. If he is still asleep five minutes later a wristband will deliver a mild but \"not very pleasant\" electric shock.\n\nEarlier in his career he experimented with having two colleagues live with him before a race, making sure he slept for 20 minutes every two hours to prepare his body for the sleep patterns at sea.\n\nIt got to the point where they had to stand at the door and poke him with a stick, like rousing an angry bear.

MUST WATCH Conrad Colman: Face-to-face with Mother Nature 03:11\n\nExtreme methods\n\nIn the Route du Rhum, Thomson is not allowed outside assistance so another technique when he is faced with a difficult dilemma is to have imaginary conversations with notable sailors such as Sir Robin Knox-Johnston or other experts.\n\n\"It's just a little mental trick of being able to get somebody else's opinion without speaking to anyone,\" he adds.\n\nBut the \"most extreme example\" from his tool kit is a \"car crash\" technique to avoid complacency, which is when accidents can happen.\n\nThomson says he is an \"emotional person\" and his mood on the boat tends to be governed by how he is doing in the race.\n\nIf he is faring badly he will work harder, foregoing sleep and food -- which is, at best, undisciplined. But worse, he says, is if he is doing well he gets \"high\" which leads to complacency.\n\nTo combat this, the pair have developed a system that automatically counters feelings of \"invincibility\" with the emotional surge of a near car crash.\n\n\"By practising, so that whenever you feel you're on top of the world you get the shot of adrenaline from the near car crash, and you wonder what's going to happen next, it's a way of leveling me out and stopping me becoming complacent,\" he says.\n\nThomson kite surfs high above his Hugo Boss yacht in a publicity stunt.\n\nThomson dismisses the notion that long-distance solo sailors must be in some way \"weird\" because of the amount of time spent alone in an unremitting, potentially life-threatening environment, and says it all depends on how you view the world.\n\n\"You have to be a strong personality and have the ability to put yourself through things most people wouldn't consider,\" he says.\n\n\"If you want to call that odd, then we're all odd. I'm different in that I'm more extroverted so it's not natural for me to be on my own, but it's how you look at things.\n\n\"People say you must get lonely, but I say you can be lonely in a large group of people. I separate loneliness from isolation, and it just makes it easier to deal with. People say three months [at sea] is a long time -- I don't think it is. It goes so quickly.\n\n\"The natural human tendency is to look at things in a negative light, but I try to look at things in a positive mode.\n\n\"It becomes less about the speed of boat and more about people management and I find that pretty interesting.\"", "(CNN) Two Saudi sisters found dead along the banks of the Hudson River had made statements they would rather kill themselves than return to Saudi Arabia, the New York Police Department said its detectives had learned.\n\nBut so far, investigators have uncovered no credible evidence that Rotana Farea, 23, and Tala Farea, 16, were victims of foul play, Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea told reporters at a news conference Friday afternoon. Police earlier said Rotana was 22 years old.\n\n\"At this point in time we have no credible information that a crime took place in New York City,\" Shea said, \"but it is still under investigation.\"\n\nThe sisters were last seen by their family in Virginia on November 30, 2017, Shea said.\n\nBefore their disappearance, the sisters were living in some kind of \"shelter-like\" facility due to abuse allegations that came up in their home jurisdiction.\n\nShea did not elaborate or give further details on reports of abuse, which he said are not corroborated at this time.\n\nAccording to Shea, investigators believe the sisters left Fairfax, Virginia, on either August 23 or 24 and took different methods of transportation, including Uber, to New York, where they arrived on or about September 1.\n\nUntil their bodies were discovered October 24, the sisters stayed at high-end hotels, went shopping and ordered food on a credit card until police believe \"the money started to run out,\" Shea said. The credit card was maxed out.\n\nTala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 23, were found dead last week.\n\nIn video police have seen, the sisters were in \"apparently good health\" as recently as a week before their bodies were found on the riverbank, duct-taped together in a way that appeared to be \"keeping them together,\" Shea said, but was not meant to bind them.\n\nInvestigators have also spoken to an eyewitness who came forward Wednesday and told police he saw two girls sitting in a playground park adjacent to the Hudson the day the bodies were found.\n\nThe witness was out exercising at about 7 a.m. when he saw two girls sitting about 30 feet apart with their heads in their hands, praying.\n\nShea described the witness as a \"credible source\" who told police the encounter had been \"haunting him.\"\n\nShea also confirmed investigators believe the girls were alive when they entered the water. The location where the witness saw two girls was \"a very short distance from the Hudson River,\" and such that they could have walked right in.\n\nInvestigators suspect suicide, official says\n\nFairfax County police previously said the sisters were reported missing for one day in December 2017.\n\nOfficer Tara Gerhard, a spokeswoman for the Fairfax department, said the sisters were \"referred to services,\" but she could not specify what type of services, or offer additional details, citing privacy laws.\n\nThe sisters were Saudi citizens, and their nation's royal consulate general has been in contact with their family and has appointed a lawyer for the investigation.\n\nA law enforcement official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity previously said investigators have not found anything to indicate the sisters were victims of foul play.\n\nShea echoed that belief in Friday's news conference, saying, \"It is entirely credible that the girls entered the water alive.\"\n\nPolice previously said their bodies showed no signs of trauma. Shea dismissed reports they jumped from the George Washington Bridge because there were no marks on the body that would indicate a fall from that height.\n\nWhile investigators believe their deaths are suicides, the official said, they are investigating the circumstances surrounding them.\n\nThe New York Police Department is not ready to determine the official causes of death. Authorities are investigating whether the deaths were the result of suicide, homicide or an accident, said Phil Walzak, deputy commissioner for public information for the New York police.\n\nDid the sisters apply for asylum?\n\nSaudi officials are looking into whether the sisters applied for asylum in the United States, a Saudi official told CNN.\n\nOfficials from the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment and referred questions to the New York police.\n\nThey had been in the United States for two to three years, according to Shea.\n\nEarlier this week, The New York Times reported the Saudi Embassy in Washington had called Rotana and Tala's mother to inform her that her daughters had applied for asylum in the United States.\n\nShea said earlier this week that detectives have been in Virginia conducting interviews with members of the immediate family to shed light on \"what was going on in the two young ladies' lives.\"\n\n\"We've made significant progress

The Turkish chief prosecutor's office said Wednesday that the Washington Post columnist and moderate critic of the Saudi regime was killed as soon as he entered the consulate October 2.\n\nHis murder follows on from the killing of Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in a car bomb in October 2017.\n\nCaruana Galizia had been involved in the Panama Papers investigation into offfshore wealth and was looking into alleged corruption in Maltese politics at the time of her death.\n\nMaltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed in October 2017\n\nHer sons, Matthew and Andrew Caruana Galizia, have led the campaign to find out who was responsible for the their mother's murder and frequently speak out on the issue of press freedom.\n\nRead More", "Jakarta (CNN) Indonesia's authorities lifted the wheels of crashed Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 out of the sea Friday, as questions turned to how to retrieve what is left of the body of the aircraft from the seabed.\n\nInvestigators located a plane engine turbine on the ocean floor Friday, one of the largest pieces of debris found so far, five days after the flight crashed into the sea off the capital Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nDivers located the flight data recorder and landing gear on Thursday, but an aviation official with knowledge of the crash investigation told CNN on Friday that the flight data recorder was so deeply submerged in water that Indonesian investigators are having trouble getting data off of it.\n\nThere's a great deal of mystery surrounding the cause of the crash, considering this was a brand-new aircraft.\n\nThe flight data recorder contains critical information about how the plane's systems were performing in the moments before the crash.\n\nThe source said Boeing and NTSB are flying special equipment to Indonesia to assist Indonesian authorities in pulling that valuable information from the flight data recorder, commonly known as a black box.\n\nDivers are still looking for the cockpit voice recorder to shed more light on what happened in the final moments of the flight.\n\nAnalysts say finding the cockpit voice recorder is imperative to determine if the crash has implications for other airlines collectively operating thousands of Boeing 737 flights around the world each day.\n\n\"We need to know whether there is a Lion Air problem, a specific problem to this plane, or whether it is a general wider problem for 737s,\" said Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of airline rating agency, Airlineratings.com.\n\nFinding the cockpit voice recorder is proving challenging. The chief of Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency, Muhammad Syauqi Syauqi, said his team had not heard pings from the cockpit voice recorder. It is thought to be on the seabed, some 35 meters (114 feet) from the surface, obscured by debris or hidden by mud.\n\nA wheel from the crashed Lion Air Flight JT610 was pulled from the sea by Indonesian authorities on Nov. 2, 2018.\n\nTreacherous conditions\n\nIn ideal conditions, analysts said, investigators would try to document the positioning of the aircraft and its parts in the water, so they can determine the cause of impact before the plane is raised. But in Indonesia, divers are battling against treacherous conditions, including fast-moving currents and muddy waters.\n\n\"The prudent measure in this case is to take it off the floor of the ocean as it's too dangerous to analyze it where it is sitting at the moment,\" said Thomas.\n\nA photo from Indonesian media agency \"detikcom\" shows officials displaying part of the ill-fated Lion Air flight JT 610's flight data recorder, after it was recovered from the Java Sea on Thursday, November 1.\n\nIf the plane's fuselage had been found intact, buoyancy devices would have been used to raise the plane body to incur minimal damage. But Thomas said the plane is so shattered \"that finding or doing further damage to it now is almost incidental.\"\n\nRecovery of these smaller items is likely to be done by hand or with nets, said David Soucie, an aviation safety analyst for CNN.\n\nA big challenge for divers will be to identify and separate any body parts from other debris. \"You look at the insulation and the seat backs, the seat cushions can easily be mistaken for body parts and vice versa,\" Soucie said.\n\nAs well as searching for the cockpit voice recorder, divers will be looking for clues in the debris that could indicate what state the plane was in when it crashed.\n\n\"Let's say you have the landing gear and maybe two miles away you find other pieces of the aircraft that are heavy, like engines and that sort of thing, then you would suspect that there was an in-flight break up of the airplane. As opposed to a solid impact of the airplane in one piece,\" he said.\n\nSoucie said that from the extent of the damage, it appears the Lion Air flight suffered from a \"hydraulically driven explosion\" when it hit the water. This means that on impact, the pressurized air hits the water and causes the fuselage to rupture.\n\n\"You have to think about this thing hitting the water at 400 miles per hour or faster and just coming to a sudden stop,\" Soucie said. \"You've heard people say water is like concrete when you dive from 100 feet up, so you can imagine what it would be like at 400 miles per hour. It's hard to describe the types of damage that occur with that.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED No answers on cause of Lion Air plane crash Replay More Videos ...

Instead it crashed 13 minutes after takeoff. The pilots had requested to turn around but didn't transmit an emergency call.\n\nAs of Friday, 65 body bags have been gathered since the start of the search-and-rescue operation, though each bag could contain remains of more than one person.\n\nInvestigators will have to rely on DNA samples to identify victims because of the condition and size of the remains found. Police have 181 DNA samples from victims' families and are working to match them to 272 human tissues samples.\n\nLisda Cancer, head of Disaster Victim Identification, told reporters Friday that only one person has been identified so far -- a female confirmed through a fingerprint.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities started bringing relatives to the port to identify victims' personal belongings, which lay piled up next to cushions and other debris that appeared to be from the aircraft.\n\nEpi Syamsul Qomar, whose 24-year-old son was on the flight, broke down in tears when he recognized his son's shoe.\n\n\"I saw my son's black sneaker,\" he told CNN. \"I also saw his bank checkbook.\"\n\nPhotos: In photos: Lion Air plane crashes off Indonesia A relative of one of the crash victims tosses flower petals from an Indonesian Navy ship on Tuesday, November 6.

After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked.

We would always want institutions and political parties and similar to be able to regulate themselves,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today program.\n\n\"However, if somebody passes us material which they say amounts to a crime we have a duty to look at that and not just dismiss it.\n\n\"We have been assessing some material that was passed to me, in a radio studio of all things, about two months ago and we are now investigating some of that material because it appears there may have been crime committed.

He has been heavily criticized for failing to tackle the issue, with UK Jewish groups holding protests across the country.\n\nCorbyn, who long served on his party's backbenches in Parliament, has a history of associating with fringe left-wing groups whose support for the Palestinian cause often bleeds into anti-Semitism, wrote political commentator John McTernan earlier this year . When Corbyn became leader, those views were brought into the mainstream.\n\nOn July 25, Britain's three leading Jewish newspapers -- the Jewish Chronicle, Jewish Telegraph and Jewish News -- took the unprecedented step of publishing the same front page, with the headline \"United we stand,\" in which they argued that any Corbyn-led government would be an \"existential threat\" to Jewish life in Britain.\n\nThis is the single most astonishing front page we've run at @JewishChron in my decade here.

Algunos esperaban que Trump anunciara una nueva pol\u00edtica sobre asilo, pero en cambio volvi\u00f3 a los mismos temas que han sido pilares de su presidencia. Revisamos algunas de sus afirmaciones para confirmar su veracidad.\n\nEl presidente hizo una estimaci\u00f3n de la gente que intenta cruzar la frontera ilegalmente\n\nAfirmaci\u00f3n: El presidente dijo que \"Todos los d\u00edas, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de nuestros programas de admisi\u00f3n legal existentes, aproximadamente entre 1.500 y 2.000 personas intentan cruzar nuestras fronteras ilegalmente\".\n\nVerificaci\u00f3n de hechos: Esto no est\u00e1 claro.\n\nLos datos disponibles de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protecci\u00f3n Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) indican que un total de 396.579 fueron detenidas por la Patrulla Fronteriza durante el a\u00f1o fiscal 2018 en la frontera sur, lo que representar\u00eda un promedio de 1.087 cada d\u00eda. Las cifras difieren cada mes. La mayor cifra de aprehensiones de individuos que cruzan la frontera ilegalmente se registr\u00f3 en septiembre, con un promedio diario de 1.400.\n\nHist\u00f3ricamente, CBP ha usado las detenciones para medir los cruces ilegales.\n\nSi el presidente tambi\u00e9n incluye los 124.511 individuos considerados inadmisibles para entrar a Estados Unidos, el promedio en el periodo del a\u00f1o ser\u00eda de poco m\u00e1s de 1.400 al d\u00eda.\n\nEl presidente habl\u00f3 de violencia entre la caravana y la polic\u00eda mexicana\n\nAfirmaci\u00f3n: El presidente dijo que \"es como una invasi\u00f3n. Ellos rebasaron violentamente la frontera mexicana. Lo vimos hace dos d\u00edas... ellos rebasaron a la polic\u00eda mexicana, y han superado y herido gravemente a soldados mexicanos\".\n\nVerificaci\u00f3n de hechos: Esta afirmaci\u00f3n es cierta en parte, pero enga\u00f1osamente busca desprestigiar a un grupo de miles por las acciones de unos cuantos.\n\nCNN report\u00f3 que hubo enfrentamientos entre un grupo de migrantes y las fuerzas mexicanas el domingo.\n\n\"Mientras este grupo contin\u00faa su viaje, otros grandes grupos de migrantes centroamericanos est\u00e1n siguiendo sus pasos, incluyendo otro grupo de unas 3.000 personas que lleg\u00f3 a la frontera entre M\u00e9xico y Guatemala el domingo. La situaci\u00f3n r\u00e1pidamente se sali\u00f3 de control\", de acuerdo con Michelle Mendoza, de CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, quien report\u00f3 desde el lugar de los hechos.\n\nLos migrantes lanzaron rocas y palos. Las fuerzas mexicanas usaron gas lacrim\u00f3geno. En los enfrentamientos falleci\u00f3 Henry Adalid D\u00edaz Reyes, un hondure\u00f1o de 26 a\u00f1os, de acuerdo con la fiscal\u00eda general de Guatemala. Las autoridades est\u00e1n investigando. Muchos otros migrantes y polic\u00edas resultaron con heridas leves.\n\nEl ministro del Interior de M\u00e9xico, Alfonso Navarrete, conden\u00f3 la violencia y dijo que los \"agresores\" estaban armados con bombas molotov. \"La \u00fanica forma de entrar a M\u00e9xico es cumpliendo las leyes de inmigraci\u00f3n\", dijo.\n\nEl presidente dijo que M\u00e9xico le hab\u00eda ofrecido asilo a algunos miembros de la caravana\n\nAfirmaci\u00f3n: \"M\u00e9xico ha acordado aceptarlos y les anim\u00f3 a quedarse, pero ellos no quieren quedarse. Ellos quieren venir a Estados Unidos, as\u00ed que ya no es una cuesti\u00f3n de seguridad, y el asilo es una cuesti\u00f3n de seguridad\".\n\nVerificaci\u00f3n de hechos: Esto es enga\u00f1oso.\n\nCNN report\u00f3 que algunos migrantes de la caravana han solicitado asilo en M\u00e9xico.\n\n\"Bajo un plan llamado 'Est\u00e1s en tu Casa', funcionarios dijeron que aquellos migrantes en edad de trabajar podr\u00edan solicitar asilo y ser\u00edan elegibles para ciertos empleos, siempre que se queden en Chiapas y Oaxaca, dos estados en el sur de M\u00e9xico. Los migrantes se encuentran actualmente en Oaxaca, a cientos de kil\u00f3metros de la frontera con Estados Unidos y probablemente a semanas, si no meses, de que intenten cruzarla. Aun antes del anuncio del presidente de M\u00e9xico, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, m\u00e1s de 2.700 migrantes de este grupo hab\u00edan presentado documentos para solicitar asilo en M\u00e9xico, y cientos hab\u00edan acordado voluntariamente regresar a su pa\u00eds de origen. Pero miles m\u00e1s se dirigen hacia el norte\".\n\nEl presidente afirma que el ej\u00e9rcito prepara miles de carpas para los migrantes\n\nAfirmaci\u00f3n: El presidente dijo: \"Estamos instalando grandes ciudades de carpas. El ej\u00e9rcito nos est\u00e1 ayudando incre\u00edblemente bien con esto. Quiero agradecer al Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ej\u00e9rcito. Ellos han sido muy eficientes, muy buenos, muy talentosos, que ya tenemos miles de carpas. Tenemos much\u00edsimas carpas\".\n\nVerificaci\u00f3n de hechos: Esto es enga\u00f1oso.\n\nUn funcionario de defensa estadounidense dijo que por el momento no hay planes de instalar carpas para migrantes. Aunque el gobierno ha alojado a menores no acompa\u00f1ados en Tornillo, Texas, el presidente parece referirse a carpas que est\u00e1n siendo instaladas actualmente. El martes, el general a cargo del Comando Norte, general Terrence O'Shaughnessy, dijo que para la \"Operaci\u00f3n Patriota Fiel\" como est\u00e1 ahora, la solicitud que tenemos del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional y el CBP es de instalar carpas para apoyar al personal de CBP y a nuestro personal militar\".\n\nEl presidente habl\u00f3 del n\u00famero de no ciudadanos en el pa\u00eds que est\u00e1n en medio de un proceso inmigratorio\n\nAfirmaci\u00f3n: \"Ahora hay cerca de 700.000 extranjeros dentro de Estados Unidos esperando que se acepte su solicitud\".\n\nVerificaci\u00f3n de hechos: Esta afirmaci\u00f3n es cierta.\n\nEstad\u00edsticas del Departamento de Justicia muestran que en 2018 existen 786.303 casos pendientes en la Oficina Ejecutiva de Revisi\u00f3n de Inmigraci\u00f3n, el \u00f3rgano del departamento que adjudica esas solicitudes.\n\nEl presidente dio la impresi\u00f3n de que el gobierno federal ya empez\u00f3 a construir el muro fronterizo\n\nAfirmaci\u00f3n: \"... Incluyendo la construcci\u00f3n del mundo, que ya empezamos. 1.600 millones de d\u00f3lares gastados el a\u00f1o pasado, 1.600 millones este a\u00f1o. Tenemos otros 1.600 millones que ya vendr\u00e1, pero queremos construirlo de una vez\".\n\nVerificaci\u00f3n de hechos: Esto es enga\u00f1oso. Aunque est\u00e1 en lo correcto cuando dice que 1.600 millones de d\u00f3lares fueron aprobados por el Congreso, esto es solo una peque\u00f1a fracci\u00f3n de los 25.000 millones de d\u00f3lares en fondos solicitados, y el dinero se ha utilizado sobre todo en reparaciones, no en construcci\u00f3n. Al afirmar que la construcci\u00f3n ya est\u00e1 en marcha, Trump parece estar tomando el cr\u00e9dito, como ya ha hecho en el pasado, de un proyecto que Aduanas y Protecci\u00f3n Fronteriza ha solicitado durante a\u00f1os y que es completamente aparte de su bien conocida propuesta de construir un muro a lo largo de toda la frontera sur.\n\nEn San Diego, el gobierno federal est\u00e1 reemplazando 22 kil\u00f3metros de una barda de 74 kil\u00f3metros con una muro m\u00e1s fuerte, pero hasta ahora solo la mitad ha sido reemplazada, de acuerdo con un portavoz del CBP.", "Miami (CNN) Two presidents, past and present, dominated the campaign trail Friday, as Barack Obama assailed Donald Trump for \"lying\" and \"constant fear-mongering,\" prompting Trump to snap back that Obama had attracted a \"very small crowd.\"\n\nObama campaigned in Florida and Georgia for Democratic candidates in two of the key races in Tuesday's midterm elections. In some of his sharpest criticism of Trump yet, the former President cast his successor as a compulsive liar with an authoritarian streak.\n\nHe hammered President Donald Trump and the GOP for claiming to support the Affordable Care Act's coverage protections for those with pre-existing conditions -- even as Trump's Justice Department is involved in a lawsuit to end those safeguards and the GOP congressional majority attempted to repeal the law.\n\n\"What we have not seen is politicians just blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying -- just making stuff up,\" Obama said in Miami. \"That's what they're doing right now, all the time.\"\n\nObama also accused Trump of \"constant fear-mongering\" and a disdain for the truth that was corroding the infrastructure of American political life.\n\n\"When words don't mean anything, when truth doesn't matter, when people can just lie with abandon, democracy can't work,\" Obama said.\n\nShortly afterward, Trump said in West Virginia that he'd watched Obama's speech on television aboard Air Force One.\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama, Trump bring dueling messages to campaign trail Replay More Videos ...

Obama scorned Trump and other Republicans for \"vilifying others, questioning their patriotism\" and then expressing concerns about civility.\n\nIn response to Trump's recent suggestions that he could revoke the promise of birthright citizenship with the stroke of a pen, Obama said that \"a president doesn't get to decide on his own who's an American citizen and who's not,\" a rejoinder that delighted the partisans in Miami's Ice Palace Film Studios.\n\nObama's pitch was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers, leading him to ask at one point: \"Why is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time?\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama: Got to have a few hecklers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama: Got to have a few hecklers 00:58\n\nIn line outside the venue, hours before Obama would take the stage, supporters -- who had followed Trump's recent trip to the state -- said they welcomed the juxtaposition.\n\n\"You have a president that's going to be here today and you have an entertainer that's in office right now,\" said Rashawn Watson, a Democrat from Miami Gardens. \"Trump's entertaining base versus actually caring about America.\"\n\nObama argued much the same during portions of his speech, calling Trump's recent decision to send thousands of troops to the border to defend against a group of migrants that is still hundreds of miles away \"a political stunt\" -- and an affront to service members who \"deserve better than that.\"\n\nIn West Virginia, meanwhile, Trump acknowledged that a message focused on the economy -- which congressional Republicans urged him for months to put at the forefront of the GOP's campaign efforts -- is sometimes \"not as exciting to talk about ... because we have a lot of other things to talk about.\"\n\nTrump defended a racist web video he had tweeted Wednesday depicting Democrats as responsible for an undocumented immigrant killing two police officers. ( A CNN review of the immigrant's case shows multiple interactions with local and federal officials in both Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as with noted anti-immigration firebrand Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff who received Trump's first presidential pardon last year.)\n\n\"They gave me a hard time because I put it up on Twitter,\" Trump told a crowd in Huntington. \"They said, 'You shouldn't be doing that! That's not nice!' \"\n\n\"And I say, all I'm doing is just telling the truth, what can I say?\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump on campaign ad: 'Just telling the truth' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on campaign ad: 'Just telling the truth' 01:01\n\nTrump also acknowledged that Democrats could win a congressional majority -- though he suggested he wouldn't be to blame if they do.\n\n\"I'm not saying that they won't squeak it by, maybe, because they've got a lot of races, and I can't go everywhere,\" he said.\n\nThe races in Georgia and Florida are, perhaps more than any other on the wide and varied 2018 map, a referendum on the first two years of the Trump era -- and whether Democrats have nailed down a path for defeating the President's acolytes in the Republican Party.\n\nObama won twice in Florida and lost by relatively narrow margins in Georgia (about 5 points in 2008 and 8 points in 2012) with pitches that largely predicted Gillum and Abrams, who have steeped themselves in progressive populism while being careful not to alienate moderate business interests. Like Obama, they have been mostly successful in synthesizing those messages with the aid of compelling personal narratives.\n\nGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, could become Florida's first African-American governor with a victory next week. The election of Abrams, a former Georgia House minority leader, would make her the first female African-American governor in the country.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump admits Republicans can lose the House Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump admits Republicans can lose the House 01:02\n\nRepublican candidates in 2018 have, quite obviously, gone in a different direction.\n\nFormer Rep. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Gillum's opponent, and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who's running against Abrams, won their primaries by latching on to Trump and all that comes with him. While both have made occasional nods to their party's moderate establishment, a necessity in Florida, where a rolling series of environmental crises -- from toxic algae bloom to wildfires and stronger storms -- are dominating the political atmosphere in both typically Republican and Democratic strongholds, neither has made any real attempt to persuade centrist Democrats.\n\nStill, Obama had a heavier lift on his hands in Miami than Trump did in Fort Myers, where it seemed like just about everyone at his rally had already voted the party line.\n\n\"Who voted?\" Trump asked the packed arena. When his question was met with an immediate roar, the President seemed genuinely taken aback. \"Everybody voted already? No kidding. Let me see it again. Who voted?\"\n\nAgain, the audience howled, leading Trump to deadpan: \"Then what the hell am I doing here tonight?\"", "London (CNN Business) 1. Great expectations: Shares in Apple (APPL) were poised to drop sharply after the company warned that sales during the holiday quarter would fall short of analyst expectations.\n\nThe tech firm said Thursday it expects fourth quarter sales of between $89 billion and $93 billion, not much more than the record $88.3 billion it reported a year ago.\n\nApple's third quarter earnings report came with a few more surprises: It said it will stop reporting how many iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells each quarter.\n\nThat could be because sales of Apple's flagship device have flattened.

But experts say the people whose health is most at risk are the migrants themselves.\n\nA story in the right-wing magazine The New American this weekend was headlined Will Migrant Caravan Kill Your Child - With Disease? On Monday, \"Fox& Friends\" co-host Brian Kilmeade claimed that the refugees pose a threat because they carry \"diseases\" and shouldn't be let in.\n\nA commentator on Fox, former immigration agent David Ward, also claimedthat the migrants carry disease \"such as smallpox and leprosy and [tuberculosis] that are going to infect our people in the United States.\" Later, according to the Daily Beast , Fox's press office sent out a clip clarifying the issue that mentioned only TB and leprosy and added, \"we have no way of independently confirming this.\"\n\nThese claims are unlikely, experts say.\n\nThe World Health Assembly declared the world free of smallpox in May 1980, considered the biggest achievement in international public health, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nTuberculosis is a problem around the world. The United States saw 9,105 cases in 2017, according to the CDC\n\nPueblo Sin Fronteras , a nonprofit working with the migrants, says that some people in the group are in a \"delicate condition\" but that their health issues don't relate to diseases that would be a threat to others. Rather, there are threats to their own health that stem from their difficult circumstances.\n\nThe migrants have walked hundreds of miles, many wearing only flip-flops, rubber clogs and sneakers that are falling apart. They have limited food and water. They've had to cross rivers and battle grueling heat and torrential rains. They sleep outside, on sidewalks or on floors. Many are exhausted, but still they walk a daily marathon\n\n\"I am feeling some chills. I have had a fever for a few days,\" Carlos Gomez told CNN on Sunday . An out-of-work farmhand from Honduras, he says he has no choice but to walk. He needs to find a way to earn a living and to feed his eight children. \"There is no work anymore. The government took our lands,\" he said.\n\nFederal and state health departments in Mexico are working closely with the caravan, as is the Cruz Roja Mexicana, or the Mexican Red Cross\n\nIsaac Oxenhault of Cruz Roja Mexicana, who worked with the migrants when they reached Tapachula, said his group has treated more than 2,000 people for health problems. Foot injuries from the long journey are most common, he said, estimating that the Red Cross has treated 1,300 to 1,400 people for these issues.\n\nCruz Roja Mexicana has also treated about 400 people for problems with dehydration, supplying water and in some cases using IVs. Some have been treated for stomach problems, but these cases have been minimal, Oxenhault said.\n\nAt least three women have gone into labor, the Red Cross said, though all gave birth in hospitals. The Red Cross transported one of them for care. As far as serious illnesses like cancer or HIV, Oxenhault said, it has no record of any of those problems.\n\n\"There are general health needs besides this crisis and they are vulnerable in different ways, because many don't get formal medical care. They have not had preventative or curative care before,\" said Dr. Ricardo Perez Cuevas with the Mexican Institute of Public Health. \"In terms of the possibility to infect other people, very low possibility.\"\n\nCuevas hopes to work with the migrant population to get more information about their general health and to make sure they get the help they need like vaccinations and general care. \"Health care is a human right. It should not just be about avoiding disease, it should be about getting proper care.\"\n\nRene Leyva who works with Cuevas on immigrant health issues said to remember that migrant caravans are not a new phenomenon and for at least 15 years this team, and the public health sector overall in Mexico, have learned how to provide good health to the migrants traveling from Central America. \"These are not health problems that would cause an epidemic, not at all, but there are some urgent situations of poor health conditions that come from exposure to the sun and to mosquitoes, perhaps food-related illness like diarrhea, and the risk of being hurt from car accidents on the road, but our health system has the capacity to resolve those consequences. They are not going to transmit disease from these countries to Mexico or elsewhere\"\n\nOf the 5,000 to 6,000 people who remain in the group, many are children facing their own health challenges.\n\nDr. Julie Linton, a pediatrician who works with immigrants from the region in the United States, but has not worked with this particular group, said that the No. 1 concern for children in such circumstances is trauma.\n\n\"What often gets lost in the rhetoric is that these families that are leaving are fleeing violence. These parents are seeking safety for their children and their family, and when we talk about people making this kind of journey, they are doing this and everything they can do to protect health and safety,\" said Linton, co-chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Immigrant Health Special Interest Group.\n\nTrauma can interfere with sleep, lead to challenges with bed-wetting and create eating problems. Parents may also see a change in their child's behavior, Linton said.\n\nChildren who have experienced trauma can have exaggerated responses to situations and problems with peers. They can experience a deep fear of separation from their parents. Trauma can hurt memory, limit concentration and make organizing thoughts difficult.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe trauma facing migrants in these circumstances doesn't start with the act of migration.\n\n\"I've taken care of children and families who have experienced direct threats or experienced physical harm from gangs and others. That trauma is why they leave,\" Linton said.\n\nEven if the journey itself is hard and the outcome is uncertain, the result could help their health.\n\n\"What we know about the social determinants of health that can impact through someone's lifespan is that children are best able to achieve their dreams and survive trauma when they have access to safety and support and have a loving adult in their life that can shepherd them through childhood,\" Linton said. \"These families are undergoing this treacherous journey feeling that they have no choice but to seek safety for their families elsewhere.\"", "(CNN) Vanessa Ford wants her daughter to be treated like the rest of the children on the playground, in an arcade or anywhere else 7-year-old Ellie loves to play.\n\nRight now, Massachusetts law forbids anyone in a public place from harassing Ellie or asking her to leave because she is transgender. Ford says she hopes it stays this way -- which is why she plans to vote \"yes\" on a midterm ballot measure that civil rights groups across the country are watching closely.\n\nA \"no\" vote on Question 3 would repeal the law, which was signed in July 2016 by the commonwealth's Republican governor.\n\nThe measure is the first statewide referendum to put the question of protections for transgender people in voters' hands. In 2015, Houston voters repealed a citywide anti-discrimination ordinance protecting gender identity in public accommodations; this year, Anchorage voted to retain theirs.\n\nWhat the law does\n\nOpponents of the law say the referendum is about protecting public safety and privacy. The group that brought the question, Keep MA Safe, says the current law lets people \"self-identify\" however they wish, leaving the door open for people to impersonate members of the opposite sex for unlawful purposes, such as entering public restrooms to harass or assault women and children.\n\nKeep MA Safe fears that could lead to situations that result in criminal or civil penalties for those who complain about misuse of single-sex facilities, the group's spokeswoman, Yvette Ollada, told CNN.\n\nNo official data exists to support either of these claims. Research compiled by the National Center for Transgender Equality shows that transgender people are the ones who are more likely to experience violence or harassment for using restrooms that match their gender identity, which is why advocates say laws such as the one in Massachusetts are necessary for their safety -- and peace of mind.\n\nRon and Vanessa Ford with their children.\n\nIf a business refuses to serve 7-year-old Ellie or another patron harasses her because she is transgender, the Fords can complain to management or police and expect their report to be taken seriously. Ford points out that the law isn't about regulating bathroom access -- it's about giving her daughter and other transgender people the same rights as everyone else to go about their lives free of discrimination.\n\n\"It's hard for people to imagine someone telling a little girl to leave a restaurant or a park, but she won't be a little girl forever,\" Ford said. \"As a parent, it comforts me to know there are laws that protect her when I can't.\"\n\nHow the law works\n\nrecent study by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law on the impact of Massachusetts' law found that it did not affect the number or frequency of criminal incidents in restrooms, locker rooms or changing rooms.\n\nThe Massachusetts Attorney General's Office issued guidance on the law after it took effect emphasizing that it does not protect anyone who engages in improper or unlawful conduct in a restroom or elsewhere.\n\nThe guidance says places of public accommodation should not assume a person's gender identity based solely on appearance, and noted that \"misuse of sex-segregated facilities is exceedingly rare.\"\n\nOllada said the law puts the onus on a patron to confront the person they suspect of misusing a restroom. But neither the law or the attorney general's guidance suggest that a customer should take such action.\n\nIf a patron suspects another person of using a facility improperly, the guidance directs businesses to assess the claims. If the business has reason to believe a person is misusing a facility, they can ask the person to produce state-issued identification or a letter from a health care provider, clergy or friend attesting to their gender identity.\n\nSince the law passed, the Massachusetts Major City Police Chiefs Association said it has not heard of a single violation or act of abuse based on the concerns raised by opponents of law, said the organization's president, Chelsea Police Chief Brian Kyes.\n\n\"While we recognize that there are always potential concerns with any proposed bill or existing law, we believe that the current language in the Transgender Protection in Public Places legislation is both a fair and balanced compromise in protecting the rights of transgender individuals from possible discrimination while providing the necessary framework and mechanisms to ensure public safety in our public spaces,\" he told CNN.\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nCivil rights activists say the referendum is the latest effort to undercut civil rights for transgender people using the bathroom predator myth . They also say it is an opportunity for Massachusetts voters to stand up for the transgender community and send a message to the rest of the country at a time when LGBTQ rights are under attack from President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nIf the law stands, \"it sends the message that the people of Massachusetts respect and understand the dignity of transgender people,\" said Reg Calcagno, a state advocacy strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is supporting the vote yes campaign.\n\nIf the law fails to withstand the referendum, it could embolden opponents of similar laws in other states, Calcagno said. \"It tells me we need to have a lot more conversations about why we're uncomfortable with transgender people,\" Calcagno said.\n\nA recent leaked memo obtained by The New York Times included an administration proposal to create a legal definition of sex in federal civil rights law as an immutable condition based on genitals at birth. Such an action could threaten federal anti-discrimination protections for transgender people in the latest such move from the Trump administration to roll back hard-earned rights during the Obama era and through decades of federal court decisions.\n\nExperts say the proposal would not impact state-level protections such as those in Massachusetts, which include gender identity in its list of protected classes, along with race, sexual orientation and religion. The 2016 law added public accommodations to the list of places in Massachusetts where discrimination against transgender people is forbidden, along with employment, housing, education and lending services.\n\nMassachusetts is one of 19 states -- along with Washington DC -- with laws that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity in public accommodations, according to Movement Advancement Project , which tracks legislation and policy that affects LGBTQ rights. Many of those state laws were inspired by federal court decisions and interpretations of federal civil rights laws to include gender identity in bans of sex-based discrimination.\n\nState laws do more than tell LGBTQ people what their rights and protections are, said Naomi Goldberg, policy and research director for the Movement Advancement Project. They also tell businesses, employers and government agencies what is required of them through concerted public education efforts that put them on notice, she said.\n\nHow the referendum came about\n\nEfforts to roll back the protections began about 10 days after Massachusetts' Republican governor signed it into law in July 2016. On its website, Keep MA Safe says volunteers ultimately gathered more than 34,000 certified signatures to get the repeal on the November 2018 ballot, \"through a Herculean effort by thousands of volunteers and hundreds of churches across the Commonwealth.\"\n\nOllada said part of the group's concern stemmed from the definition of gender identity under Massachusetts law: \"a person's gender-related identity, appearance or behavior, whether or not that gender-related identity, appearance or behavior is different from that traditionally associated with the person's physiology or assigned sex at birth.\" The guidance calls it \"a person's internal sense of their own gender,\" a definition that tracks with the medical community's understanding of gender identity as something that's influenced by numerous factors, not simply anatomy.\n\nBut Ollada says proof of medical treatment -- such as counseling, hormone therapy or surgical interventions -- should be required to prove that a person is transgender, even though no such requirements exist in the medical community's definition of what it means to be transgender.\n\n\"The whole law defines gender identity based on what they say they believe,\" Ollada said.\n\nMembers of the Yes On 3 campaign, which supports the law, spent most of their time explaining what it means to be transgender, what the current law means and debunking myths about its impact on public safety, field director David Topping said. Members of the transgender and gender-nonconforming community knocked on doors and shared their stories with voters to help them understand how it would affect them, Topping said.\n\n\"This is about someone's ability to exist in public life and be themselves,\" Topping said.\n\n\"By upholding this law by voting yes, we say to folks across the country that Massachusetts is a place that welcomes transgender people and is a place where everyone deserves a fair shot.\"", "(CNN) Two physicians who lost their young son to the flu last year want parents to listen to their message, born of great grief and suffering: Get your child a flu shot.\n\nDrs. Laura and Anthony Sidari's 4-year-old son, Leon, did not get the flu vaccine last year. He died on Christmas Day, less than 48 hours after he started feeling sick.\n\n\"I didn't know a condition could kill a child that quickly who had been previously healthy,\" said Laura, a psychiatrist. \"This has been a hard haul for us, and we're very private people, but we're trying to help other families.\"\n\nLeon was one of 185 US children who died in the 2017-18 flu season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- a historic high.\n\nApproximately 80% of those children had not received a flu shot, according to the CDC.\n\nLaura and Anthony, a rheumatologist, had wanted to get Leon and his 2-year-old brother flu shots at a pharmacy. They lived in Texas, where state law prohibits pharmacists from vaccinating anyone under the age of 7.\n\nThe Sidaris with sons Cameron and Tristan after getting flu shots this fall.\n\nThe couple, busy with their newborn third child, Cameron, decided to get Leon a flu shot when they were going to the pediatrician anyway: when 2-year-old Tristan had his annual visit, scheduled for January 3.\n\nLeon died 10 days before that appointment.\n\n\"It wasn't even on my radar as something that I really, really needed to prioritize,\" Laura said. \"It just slipped through the cracks.\"\n\nThe Sidaris' story is all too familiar to Dr. Flor Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nFor 20 years, Mu\u00f1oz, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital, has worked with the American Academy of Pediatrics to increase the rate of flu vaccination for children.\n\nThe rates aren't great: Only 47.8% of children 6 months to 17 years old have had a flu shot in the previous year, according to the CDC , which recommends that everyone over 6 months get a flu shot.\n\nThe problem: Though adults can get flu shots at pharmacies or even at work, children don't have as many options.\n\nLeon Sidari died 10 days before his flu shot appointment.\n\nIn most states, there are limits or outright bans on pharmacists vaccinating children, and flu vaccine clinics at schools are the exception rather than the rule.\n\nOnly 13 states allow pharmacists to vaccinate children of any age, according to the National Association of State Pharmacy Associations.\n\n\"It's frustrating. It seems like we don't learn,\" Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\nThere's no medical reason children shouldn't get flu shots at a pharmacy, said Mu\u00f1oz, who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nSome states are changing their laws. New York used to bar pharmacists from giving flu shots to anyone under 18. This year, after the historic flu season, the state changed its laws to permit vaccination for anyone 2 or older.\n\n\"Good for you, New York!\" Mu\u00f1oz said. \"More should be done to make this happen in other states. There should be more of a push.\"\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said more should also be done to make it easier for local health departments to offer flu shot clinics. Right now, he said, it's difficult for those departments to purchase large quantities of vaccine and to bill insurance.\n\n\"We need to do more to make it easy,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe Sidaris are doing their part. Last month, they sponsored a \"Say Boo to the Flu\" event in their hometown, Albion, New York, where 59 children were vaccinated.\n\nAlthough the CDC encourages flu vaccines by the end of October each year, it's especially important to get the shot well before the holidays, Mu\u00f1oz said. Flu activity can peak in December, and holiday get-togethers can make the virus spread more quickly. It takes about two weeks for the shot to become effective after you receive it.\n\n\"Leon is my reason this season, and every season, for getting flu shots on time,\" Laura Sidari wrote on her Facebook page. \"Holiday planning and fall festivities can wait, but the flu shot cannot.\"\n\nCNN's John Bonifield and Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this story.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

be as heroic as people think, according to research presented at the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference and Exhibition on Friday.\n\n\"We actually found the protagonists were performing a greater amount of violence per hour than the antagonists. Protagonists were performing 22.7 violent events per hour, while the antagonists, or bad guys, were performing 17.5 events per hour,\" said John Muller, a medical student at Penn State College of Medicine and lead researcher of the project. The findings have not been published or peer-reviewed.\n\nThe research looks at 10 superhero films from 2015 and 2016: \"Suicide Squad,\" \"Batman: The Killing Joke,\" \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,\" \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" \"Captain America: Civil War,\" \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" \"Deadpool,\" \"Fantastic Four,\" \"Ant-Man\" and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\"\n\nTo work out who was committing the violent act, \"each major film character was classified as either a protagonist ('good guy') or antagonist ('bad guy'),\" the research says.\n\nAfter acts of violence had been identified by the researchers, they were analyzed and converted into rates of violence per hour for comparison, Muller said.\n\nThere were 2,191 total acts of violence for the good guys, compared with 1,724 for the bad guys.\n\n\"This is important because so many kids are looking up to these superheroes as positive role models and people they want to act like,\" Muller said, using Halloween as an example, when kids dress up as both the heroes and the villains from these films.\n\nThe most common type of violence seen in superhero films was fighting, with 1,620 total appearances in the movies. The antagonists were involved in only 599 of these fights.\n\nThis was followed by use of a lethal weapon, which appeared 1,263 times throughout the movies. Again, the good guys won, being responsible for 659 of these appearances, compared with the bad guys' 604 times.\n\nThe other categories of violent acts that appeared were destruction of property; bullying; intimidation or torture; and murder.\n\nBullying, intimidation and torture was the only category where antagonists were responsible for more of the incidences: 237, versus 144 for the heroes.\n\nAlthough the reasoning behind the violence for the good guys was not analyzed in the research, Muller suggests that if they are seen as committing acts of violence for a good reason, such as protecting someone, it may be better accepted and understood.\n\nThe research also found that male characters committed an average of 33.6 acts of violence per hour, compared with only 6.5 mean hours of violence per hour for female characters.\n\nThese findings could be problematic, according to Brad Bushman , a professor of communication and psychology at Ohio State University. Research has shown that children are known to imitate role models, either live or filmed.\n\n\"We know that children are strongly influenced by media characters, they think they are cool, and they're likely to imitate their behavior,\" said Bushman, who was not involved with the new study.\n\nResearch has shown that children who see movie characters drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or use guns are more likely to indulge in those behaviors themselves, he said.\n\n\"It's troubling to me that the perpetrators of the violent acts are the good guys, because that communicates the idea that aggression is justifiable as long as it's committed by a good guy,\" he said, especially as he believes superhero characters are the type of role models that children are most likely to imitate.\n\n\"We are more likely to imitate violence that is by attractive perpetrators who are justified for what they do, so superhero violence is kind of a really good recipe for that,\" said Sarah Coyne , an associate professor of human development at the School of Family Life at Brigham Young University.\n\nCoyne was not involved in the new research, but her own work has looked at how watching superhero programs influence the behavior of preschool children.\n\n\"I think that most people know that superhero movies are pretty violent. I think they might be surprised by how much violence is by the superhero themselves, as opposed to the villain,\" said Coyne, who believes that the research adds an \"accounting of the violence that's actually in superhero movies.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEven though superhero programs and movies tend to be made for older audiences, they are often popular with younger audiences, including preschool-age children, Coyne said. All of the superhero movies listed on Box Office Mojo , which is where the study sample came from, had a rating of at least PG-13.\n\nCoyne's first advice for parents is not to let children watch such movies until they are of an age at which they can understand the themes. \"They are rated PG-13 for a reason,\" she said.\n\nHowever, if adults decide to let a child watch a superhero movie, she suggests talking to them about what they saw, making sure that they understand what they are watching.\n\n\"Something that would be a great conversation would be 'OK, so there's all this violence happening. What would happen in the real world if somebody hit somebody like that?' \" she said. \"My main advice is just to avoid them until they are older. If not, please talk.\"", "(CNN) Instant soup -- often sold as \"ramen\" in the United States -- is cheap, tasty and wildly popular among hungry college students. But new research suggests that the products may put young children at risk.\n\nThe soups cause about one in five childhood scald burns, according to research to be presented Monday at the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference. Those findings have led some experts to question the safety of the meals, which often come in microwavable cups.\n\n\"It's important for us to remember, and for parents to remember, that these are just thin containers with boiling water in them,\" said Dr. Courtney Allen, a pediatric emergency fellow at Emory University who led the research.\n\n\"I think there's an assumption that these are safer than soups coming out of a stove,\" she said, \"when, in fact, they're not.\"\n\nThousands of burns every year\n\nAllen's research team looked at more than 4,500 pediatric scald burns recorded over nearly an 11-year period in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a federal database that tracks consumer product-related injuries. They then scoured the data, which considered children 4 to 12 years old, for keywords such as \"instant soup,\" \"instant noodles\" and \"cup of soup.\"\n\nThe researchers found 972 injuries associated with microwaving the products, making up 21.5% of all scald burns in their sample. They estimated that instant soups are to blame for nearly 10,000 pediatric burns in the United States every year.\n\nResearchers found that more than 90% of children burned by instant soup were discharged from the emergency department after evaluation. But scald burns -- which are caused by liquids or steam instead of dry heat -- can sometimes require hospitalization and even surgery.\n\n\"To be honest with you, it's a very, very common story,\" said Dr. David Greenhalgh, chief of burns at Shriners Hospitals for Children - Northern California and former president of the American Burn Association.\n\n\"They knock [the soup] over, and it spills onto their lap,\" said Greenhalgh, who was not involved in the research. \"They may have to come into the hospital for a while, or we teach the family how to take care of the burn, or some kids need skin grafts. But I am not surprised.\"\n\nThe researchers found that most burns affect the trunk, the bodily region from the shoulders to the groin, and happen in children between 4 and 7 years old.\n\n\"I think one of the important things is to identify in what stage of the process kids are injuring themselves,\" said Allen, whose team is planning to observe children carrying fake soup -- such as water with paint in it -- to determine how exactly the injuries occur.\n\n\"Is it because they're pulling it down themselves from the microwave? Is it because when they walk they're not coordinated enough and they spill? Or is it actually when they're eating it that it's tipping?\" she asked.\n\nWhatever the cause, Allen believes parents should be extra cautious when allowing children to handle instant soups. \"If you're going to let your children independently cook, carry and consume these products, they do need adequate supervision.\"\n\nWhen it comes to preventing soup-related burns, Greenhalgh believes that most parents just don't understand how bad injuries can be. But in some cases, he said, parents may downplay any dangers for the sake of convenience.\n\n\"Many studies show that parents may know the risks with scald burns, but they tend to cut corners sometimes,\" he said. \"They may know it's a risk, but it's quicker and easier, and they hope nothing happens.\"\n\nProduct design may be to blame\n\nGreenhalgh warns that poor product design may make instant soups particularly dangerous. They often come in flimsy paper or Styrofoam cups that are heated in microwaves, leaving boiling water in potentially unstable containers.\n\nIn a 2006 study published in the Journal of Burn Care and Research, Greenhalgh looked at the stability of instant soup containers and found that taller and thinner cups were easier to tip than shorter, stockier ones. Those findings could have implications for manufacturers hoping to reduce the risk of product-related burns.\n\n\"What [companies] should do is make them like the Yoplait [yogurt] containers, where they're wider at the bottom and thinner at the top,\" Greenhalgh said. \"It would be a very simple thing to design and change.\"\n\nNissin Cup Noodles, one widely sold brand, tipped at an incline of just 21.2 degrees. Products with wider bases could be angled over 60 degrees before tipping.\n\nMaruchan, Nissin and Nongshim, three large instant soup manufacturers, did not respond to requests for comment on the new research, and their designs have changed little since Greenhalgh's 2006 study.\n\nBut some experts believe Allen's new research should be a wake-up call for the industry. \"It should at least give them pause about their product design packaging,\" said Dr. James J. Gallagher, director of the William Randolph Hearst Burn Center at NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center.\n\nWhat to do if your child is burned\n\nCurious and increasingly independent children often put themselves at risk for scald burns, Gallagher says, so all parents should know how to assess and treat the injuries.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"When they start to become mobile and can do things on their own, scalding in your own home and in your own kitchen is the number one way they get hurt,\" he said.\n\nIf a child is burned, he said, \"the most important thing is to get the clothing off\" and immediately run the affected tissue under cold water.\n\nNot all burns require medical attention, but some warrant a hospital visit. \"After you've done the first aid, take a good look at the child. If you're seeing any blistering, then certainly the child should be seen by a physician,\" Gallagher said.\n\nEmergency rooms and urgent care centers can treat the injuries, he said, but most instant soup injuries aren't life-threatening. \"Almost always, in these situations, a child will be stable enough to ride over to a burn center, which isn't always the closest hospital.\"\n\nAnd though accidents do happen, parents can take simple steps to reduce risk in the kitchen, such as cooling soups before serving them, purchasing more stable containers and supervising children during mealtime.\n\nThose steps might seem unnecessary, but Gallagher says it's easier to prevent burns than treat them -- something he hopes more patients will realize.\n\n\"We at the burn center are supposed to be putting ourselves out of business,\" he said.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nToda la organizaci\u00f3n y la coordinaci\u00f3n log\u00edstica de las reuniones est\u00e1 a cargo del pa\u00eds que preside el grupo\n\nEn conjunto, los miembros del G20 representan el 85% del producto bruto global, dos tercios de la poblaci\u00f3n mundial y el 75% del comercio internacional\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) \u2014 \u00bfQu\u00e9 es y para qu\u00e9 sirve esta cumbre de l\u00edderes mundiales?\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es el G20?\n\nEl G20 naci\u00f3 en 1999 como una reuni\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica de ministros de Finanzas y presidentes de Bancos Centrales, seg\u00fan se explica en su propia p\u00e1gina web.

For Democrats, it's healthcare, gun control and education reform.\n\nThe impact of the Trump presidency on the world is only a small part of the conversation ahead of the midterms.

Ahora el espect\u00e1culo parece haber llegado a su fin.\n\nApple dijo el jueves que planea dejar de reportar cu\u00e1ntos iPhones, iPads y Macs vende cada trimestre, en lo que podr\u00eda ser una se\u00f1al del plano crecimiento en algunos de estos productos. Apple continuar\u00e1 reportando las ganancias obtenidas en estas categor\u00edas.\n\nLa medida fue solo uno de los inquietantes anuncios hechos por Apple el jueves. La compa\u00f1\u00eda dijo tambi\u00e9n que esperaba que las ventas en el important\u00edsimo trimestre vacacional fueran de entre 89.000 millones de d\u00f3lares y 93.000 millones de d\u00f3lares, lo que queda corto de las estimaciones hechas por analistas. En el nivel m\u00e1s bajo de ese rango, las ventas vacacionales de Apple mejorar\u00edan muy poco respecto respecto al r\u00e9cord de 88.300 millones reportados hace un a\u00f1o.\n\nLas acciones de Apple cayeron hasta 7% tras el cierre de las bolsas el jueves luego de conocerse el reporte. Si esas p\u00e9rdidas se mantienen, Apple corre el riesgo de perder su estatus como la \u00fanica compa\u00f1\u00eda con valor de un bill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares.\n\nLas previsi\u00f3n de ventas en el periodo vacacional es observado de cerca dado que ofrece la primera oportunidad real para saber cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 la demanda de la nueva l\u00ednea de iPhones. Los costosos iPhones XS y XS Max salieron a la venta a finales del trimestre que termin\u00f3 en septiembre, mientras que el XR, a un precio m\u00e1s accesible, sali\u00f3 a la venta el mes pasado.",

China.\n\nThe biggest rises were in Asia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged more than 4% while China's Shanghai Composite and Japan's Nikkei both jumped about 2.5%.\n\nThe positive momentum started after US President Donald Trump on Thursday talked up the prospects of a deal on trade with Beijing after speaking with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone. Trump said on Twitter that talks were \"moving along nicely.\"\n\nAsian markets then added to their gains after Bloomberg News reported that Trump has asked US cabinet officials to draft a possible trade deal with China ahead of a planned meeting with Xi at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires later this month.\n\nA spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on Friday that Trump and Xi had made progress during a \"deep discussion.\"\n\n\"I hope teams from both sides can implement the agreements achieved by the two countries' leaders,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAmid the buoyant mood, China's beaten down currency, the yuan, rose about 0.4% against the dollar. Major European markets gained around 1% in early trading, and US stock futures were up nearly 1%.\n\nGlobal stocks are rebounding after a brutal October . But Friday's uptick came despite a lack of details on how Trump aims to reach a deal with Xi after months of exchanging economic blows.\n\nJust this week, the US government struck at the heart of China's ambitions to become a global tech powerhouse by banning American companies from exporting parts and software to a major Chinese state-owned maker of computer chips.\n\nInvestors may now be letting their hopes get the better of them, according to some market watchers.\n\nMichael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at investment bank Rabobank, said he suspected Trump's upbeat comments were aimed at boosting market sentiment ahead of next week's crucial midterm elections\n\n\"This seems a perfect way to ensure equities rally into election day, put Xi into a box in terms of what is expected of him in the terms of the deal ... and then have someone to blame when the deal then falls through,\" Every said in an email.\n\nThe United States has slapped tariffs on over $250 billion of Chinese exports this year and is threatening more. China has retaliated with its own tariffs on more than $110 billion of US goods.\n\nThe Trump administration says it's trying to pressure Beijing to make deep changes to its economic policies, accusing it of overseeing the theft of US intellectual property and unfairly boosting Chinese companies through aggressive industrial programs.\n\nChina's efforts to get hold of American technology are \"an existential threat\" to the future of the US economy, according to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\nAnalysts are highly skeptical that China will agree to major changes that would address the US concerns \u2014 especially at such short notice.\n\n\"These are longstanding structural issues within the Chinese economy and cannot be reversed overnight,\" said Logan Wright, Hong Kong-based director of China research at research firm Rhodium Group.", "bad url", "(CNN) Rekha Singh lives with her husband in a New Delhi suburb. Her sons left home for work four years ago, and the couple has been trying to manage their lives as best as they can.\n\nIn India, facilities like public transport and wheelchair assistance are few and far between, meaning senior citizens are often confined to their homes. Singh is worried about her and her husband's social lives, more than their health. She misses social interaction, entertainment and shopping.\n\nIt's not common for elderly couples to live by themselves in India, as children continue living with their parents after marriage or getting jobs, forming cohesive units known as joint families. But this has been changing as young adults make their way to cities in search of jobs or go abroad for better opportunities.\n\nFor parents like the Singhs, that change is difficult to adjust to, but they have set up a routine and pursue hobbies that keep them busy. They spend most of their time in each other's company, but they have a small group of friends they can count on for social respite.\n\nEveryone needs company\n\n\"Company -- everyone needs in every age. That company we are missing here. But we have a few friends, and they are easily available,\" Singh said.\n\nOne son moved to Mumbai, and the other recently returned to New Delhi but still lives 80 kilometers (50 miles) away and so can't visit regularly.\n\nAs a result of situations like these, social interaction is highly coveted among the elderly population, according to a recent survey conducted by home care provider IVHSeniorCare.\n\nThe survey also highlighted that fewer parents living alone consider health as a key concern, with only 10% listing it as an issue that they struggle with. Of those surveyed, 36% listed social interaction as their priority, and 19% listed security.\n\nEven though Singh prefers spending time with her husband or with her grandchildren, who visit frequently, she feels the isolation that is slowly increasing for people her age.\n\n\"The general population -- even the children of elders -- have a shallow understanding of what is required for the maintenance of an elder,\" said Dr. G.S. Grewal, an elder-care consultant at Max Hospital in New Delhi. \"Parents need emotional company and security.\"\n\n\"Everyone is on their own in the Western world, and most of their needs are catered by government or insurance. However, in India, the infrastructure is not that strong. Elders expect their children to take care of them, as they did for their parents,\" said Swadeep Srivastava, founder of IVHSeniorCare.\n\n\"Children are more than happy to provide anything their parents need, but the communication gap leaves them clueless about their parents' true needs.\"\n\nA generation gap\n\nThe survey sampled 1,000 elderly people in seven states in India to find out about their lifestyles, including activities, forms of assistance they have and how often they go out.\n\nA thousand young adults who have been living away from their parents for at least five years were also interviewed.\n\nThe survey gave a glimpse into the disparity between what the elder population wants and what the youth believes they need.\n\nOnly 2% of the elderly population believes that their quality of life is good, and 71% say there is room for improvement. Social isolation is believed to be a major factor contributing to poor health.\n\n\"The quality of life is affected by these factors: nutrition, frailty, memory loss and abuse,\" said Grewal, who is also chairman of the Age Friendly Project.\n\nThis can lead to self-abuse, in which the parents do not take their medicines on time or deny themselves good food or enjoyment, said Grewal, who was not involved in the survey.\n\nAmong the young adults, 59% thought their parents spent most of their day resting, and 23% imagine them busy with household chores.\n\nThe generation gap and an inclination toward Western culture means children are not aware of their parents' true needs and end up offering them apples when their parents need oranges, Srivastava said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe survey, titled Juj Jug Jiyenge, which means \"live longer,\" estimates that there are more than 100 million senior citizens in India. This population is increasing disproportionately, and India is expected to add 240 million more senior citizens by 2050, according to IVHSeniorCare.\n\nSingh is lucky. After two lonely years, one of her sons moved back to a nearby city, and her grandchildren can visit more often. She worries about her health, but applying to an elder care program has helped. \"This problem is almost solved. The confidence level has also gone higher,\" she said.\n\nFor now, she keeps herself busy with gardening and reading books. \"My husband is happy in my company, and we go out together, and we go shopping together,\" she said. \"We step out to do small chores every now and then.\"", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

her stop was partially responsible for a dramatic crash in southwestern China that killed all 15 people on board, an investigation by Chinese authorities revealed Friday.\n\nA 10-second clip from the on-board camera released by Chongqing police showed a female passenger yelling at the male driver while he was steering, shortly after 10 a.m. on Sunday.\n\nThe 48-year-old woman then attacked the driver with her cell phone, while he fought back with his right arm.\n\nWhen she struck him again, he abruptly turned the steering wheel left, swerving into oncoming traffic before crashing into the railings on the side of a bridge -- screaming can be heard as the video stops.\n\nThe release of the clip brings an end to the mystery surrounding the cause of the deadly crash, which has come to captivate China amid extensive television coverage of a massive search-and-recovery effort.\n\nRead More", "Hong Kong (CNN Business) China's biggest ride-hailing company has a new plan to beef up customer service: hire 1,000 members of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nThe move by Didi Chuxing, a $56 billion startup, shows how leading Chinese tech firms, once hesitant to advertise political connections, are now increasingly promoting their ties to the party \u2014 especially after running into trouble with authorities.\n\n\"Tech entrepreneurs are seeking to burnish their party credentials, gain brownie points,\" said Duncan Clark, the chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory firm BDA.\n\nThe Communist Party once controlled virtually all aspects of China's economy, but reforms launched 40 years ago helped create a vast, dynamic private sector. The party retains its grip on political power and state-owned firms, but its relationship with the tech companies that have flourished with the spread of the internet is more complex.\n\nThe Chinese government has helped homegrown internet companies grow by shutting out US platforms like Facebook ( FB ) and Google ( GOOGL ). But it has also cracked down on the Chinese firms if they threaten its political aims.\n\n'Role models and pioneers'\n\nDidi announced the drive to recruit Communist Party members two weeks ago after coming under intensified scrutiny from authorities following the rape and murder of a female passenger in August, the second such killing this year.\n\n\"Being role models and pioneers, the party members will help strengthen the construction of the customer service safety system,\" Didi said in a post on social media platform WeChat. The company, which says it has more than 10,000 employees, noted 3,750 of them were already party members.\n\nHiring more Party members is a way for the startup to boost its standing with Chinese leaders.\n\n\"Didi stood accused of being reckless, careless,\" Clark said. \"This was damaging society, and anything that damages social stability gets you in major trouble with the party, which is charged with guaranteeing it.\"\n\nThe company declined to comment on the matter beyond its earlier statement.\n\nRide-hailing firm Didi is scrambling to get back into Beijing's good graces following the killings of two female passengers this year.\n\nOther tech firms, including another of the country's biggest startups, have taken similar steps.\n\nAfter getting rapped over the knuckles for promoting what authorities called \"vulgar content\" on its popular video and news apps in April, ByteDance announced it would hire 2,000 more people to review content. The job ads noted that party members and candidates with \"strong political sensitivity\" would be preferred.\n\nafter getting caught in the government's crosshairs for promoting \"vulgar content.\" It hired thousands of content reviewers, giving preference to party members. Kuaishou, a video app backed by top tech company Tencent ( TCEHY ), did the same thing earlier this yearafter getting caught in the government's crosshairs for promoting \"vulgar content.\" It hired thousands of content reviewers, giving preference to party members.\n\n'Falling foul of the party is costly'\n\nThe Communist Party of China has nearly 90 million members . The vast majority have regular day jobs, so hiring members doesn't mean government officials are infiltrating the companies.\n\nJoining the party requires people to secure recommendations from other members and to write several reports demonstrating their thoughts and ideological leanings over at least a year.\n\nMany students and young professionals who join are motivated less by ideological fervor than a desire to improve their career prospects in government or at state-owned enterprises.\n\nThe Communist Party's hammer and sickle logo at a museum in Beijing. Once hesitant to advertise political connections, China's tech giants are now increasingly promoting their ties to the party.\n\nshow where a character is \"Those seeking jobs in the tech sector or private sector generally weren't bothered. Outwardly being a party member might be as weird as, say, being a Christian in Silicon Valley,\" said Clark, referencing an episode on HBO's \"Silicon Valley\"show where a character is viewed with suspicion for being a regular churchgoer.\n\nBut now the party \"is more directly controlling the fate of Chinese tech ventures,\" Clark said. \"Falling foul of the party is costly.\"\n\nThe difference in China, observers say, is that the party has virtually unchecked power. It can deliver heavy blows to big tech companies with little warning\n\nTencent, the world's biggest gaming company, took a hit to its profits and lost billions in market value after Chinese regulators stopped approving licenses to make money from new online games. Tencent attributed the problem to a bureaucratic reshuffle in Beijing, and government statements expressed concern that video games are causing addiction and bad eyesight among young people.\n\nSome analysts interpreted the moves as a message to Tencent, which is also a big player in social media, that it was getting too big and needed to fall in line.\n\nLetting the party 'play a leading role'\n\nBeijing has other mechanisms for influencing tech firms, including requiring all companies in China, both foreign and domestic, to have party committees.\n\nWhen the committee at bike-sharing startup Ofo met in August, it voted to change the company's corporate charter to highlight the party's leadership role in management, according to state-run media.\n\nFiguring out \"how to integrate the party into corporate management and let it actually play a leading role \u2014 these are major issues for non-public companies in their party building,\" Ofo CEO Dai Wei told Xinhua. The startup's big investors include e-commerce company Alibaba ( BABA ).\n\nThe committees also often hold monthly sessions for employees' party education.\n\nByteDance's April session studied policies laid out at a recent cyberspace conference and the \"spirit\" of President Xi Jinping's speech at that event, according to state-run news site China Economic Daily.\n\nByteDance declined to comment on the matter.\n\nCynicism remains\n\nFor tech firms, expanding the role of party committees and being more open about their adherence to the Communist Party is the cost of doing business in China, especially as President Xi tightens his grip over the government and the party\n\nBut there remains \"a lot of cynicism\" within the companies, according to Paul Triolo, head of global tech policy at Eurasia Group.\n\n\"A lot of this is, 'OK, we're going to have a Xi Jinping Thought room here because that's what's in vogue,'\" Triolo said, referencing the Chinese president's political philosophy, which was added to China's constitution this year.\n\nAnd while the public displays of party affection may feel over the top, China's tech companies \"want to be out in front of this, rather than declare their alliance after something happens,\" he said.\n\nBrandishing Communist credentials could pose a problem for tech firms' global ambitions, however.\n\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, vets certain deals that could give a foreign investor control of a US business for national security risks.\n\nRecent reforms to CFIUS will likely mean increased scrutiny by the committee of China-backed deals. It already killed Alibaba-affiliated Ant Financial's acquisition of MoneyGram last year.\n\n\"To the extent these companies are viewed as arms of the Chinese government, that does not play well internationally,\" Triolo said.", "(CNN) President Donald Trump is slamming the constitutionally protected provision of birthright citizenship as a \"crazy, lunatic policy\" in an incendiary endgame to the midterm election campaign, which could save the Senate but risks putting the House beyond reach.\n\nWith four days to go, Trump is riding the strategy on which he has effectively bet his presidency -- a refusal to broaden his coalition and incessant appeals to his base -- into its biggest test so far. Yet his approach risks alienating more moderate voters in tight House races.\n\nIn one example of his all-in play to his most loyal supporters, Trump issued a new attack on the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that even children born on US soil to undocumented immigrants are American citizens, at a rally Thursday night in Missouri. The President has dubiously argued he has the power to override the provision with an executive order.\n\nAnd a day after unveiling the most racist national political ad in a generation, Trump vowed tough restrictions on asylum and turned his attention to consolidating GOP power in a trip to Missouri to support one of his proteges, Josh Hawley, who is well placed to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.\n\nThe President even said that the US troops he plans to dispatch to the border to address what he claims is a national crisis could turn their guns on members of a migrant group -- currently hundreds of miles away in Mexico -- if they threw rocks at the troops.\n\n\"Democrats want open borders and want to invite caravan after caravan into our country,\" Trump told the euphoric, fired-up crowd, which lapped up his fiery rhetoric on immigration and chanted \"Build that wall! Build that wall!\" in a display of the potency of the issue among the President's base.\n\nThe unusually distinct races for the two chambers of Congress this year mean that a scorched earth message that works well in Senate races in Trump country may backfire in House contests in more moderate territory.\n\nBut in the final days of the campaign, the President has escalated rhetorical assaults on undocumented immigrants and the traveling migrant group to new heights, delighting base voters but infuriating Republicans in swing districts and GOP strategists worried about the House.\n\nThat, and a travel schedule that appears to be mostly geared to getting red state Senate candidates over the line and toppling vulnerable Democrats, suggests the President can read the polls just as well as anyone else.\n\nMost pundits are staying away from predictions after Trump's shock win over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But a majority of models suggest the most likely outcome on Tuesday is that Democrats take the House and Republicans keep control of the Senate or even increase their majority by a couple of seats.\n\nCNN's Harry Enten assesses in his forecast that Democrats will win 225 seats -- and the House majority -- while Republicans will fall to 210 seats. A Democratic win of 202 seats or 262 seats is within the margin of error.\n\nRepublicans will hold 52 seats -- and keep the majority -- in the Senate, while Democrats will hold just 48, according to Enten's analysis. Anything between Republicans holding 48 seats and 56 seats is within the margin of error.\n\nUsing presidential symbolism to sell a campaign message\n\nTrump has been flinging flaming campaign trail attacks on immigration for days.\n\nBut on Thursday he chose the ornate surroundings of the Roosevelt Room of the White House, often the venue for solemn state announcements, for what was billed as a major policy announcement on asylum.\n\nYet what followed was a meandering speech , packed with misrepresentations and falsehoods, that lacked the big new plan that White House officials had promised -- other than a vague undertaking to issue an executive order next week.\n\nIt was the latest indication that Trump's improvisational and politically motivated pronouncements often have his policy team struggling to catch up. The same thing happened when the President suddenly pledged last month to unveil a middle-class tax cut in the next few weeks -- even though Congress, which has the power of the purse -- was not in session at the time.\n\nThe White House has since signaled there will be no movement on tax cuts until January at the earliest.\n\nIn place of a major new policy proposal on asylum, the President cranked up the demagoguery, suggesting US troops could actually open fire on members of a migrant group if they ever reach the border.\n\n\"They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\" Trump said. \"When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle,\" he said, setting out a scenario that is unlikely to come to pass and one of disproportionate force.\n\nHis warning alarmed former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel, who served as secretary of defense in the Obama administration.\n\n\"My reaction ... is one of disgust. That is a wanton incitement of unnecessary violence. It is a distraction, It is a distortion, it is a rank political purpose to use our military like this,\" Hagel told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\n\"Not in my lifetime have I ever heard those kind of words from a President of the United States.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Hagel: Trump is using our troops as pawns Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hagel: Trump is using our troops as pawns 03:16\n\nTrump also said the military was building tent cities for detained migrants, when military officials have said no such construction is underway. He also falsely claimed that his administration has started building his famed border wall, taking credit for an existing project by the federal government to replace one section of fence with a wall.\n\nHis latest escalation followed his tweet promoting a campaign video on Wednesday night that effectively equated the Central Americans in the traveling migrant group with a convicted murderer who killed two California deputies.\n\nHardcore message undercuts Republicans in tight House battles\n\nThe President's incessant, incendiary focus on immigration is frustrating some of his fellow Republicans, who have the fate of the House, especially, in mind.\n\nRep. Ryan Costello, a moderate from Pennsylvania who is retiring after the election, warned that Trump's message could be the last straw for endangered GOP House members.\n\n\"I think closing on doom and gloom and scaring people over immigration, that is not going to bring home undecided voters in swing districts,\" Costello told CNN's Lauren Fox.\n\n\"I can't imagine anybody in a close district wants the closing argument to be immigration,\" Costello said. \"Your local message is in competition with what the President is talking about.\"\n\nOther Trump supporters are frustrated that the President is not talking exclusively about the economy , which grew at 3.5% in the third quarter, has taken the unemployment rate to a 50-year low of 3.7% and has promoted soaring business and consumer confidence.\n\nNew jobless figures are expected to give Trump a further boost on Friday with the final release of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics before the election.\n\nBut the President has clearly made a decision on the most profitable way to end his campaign -- and he has opted to be true to the populist, politically incorrect persona that won him the White House in the first place.\n\nIt's possible the House was already out of reach, given his approval rating in the mid-40s, the fact that many vulnerable GOP lawmakers are running in districts that Clinton won and historical portents that suggest first-term presidents always struggle in the midterm elections.\n\nNew polling from CNN suggests that in Trump country at least, his instincts for what his voters want are shrewd.\n\nAmong likely Republican Senate voters in Florida, immigration is now an important issue for 33% of voters, up from 22% in mid-October, before he hit on his flaming midterm election closing argument.", "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN Hong Kong\n\nEnveloped in sheets of blue, green and yellow, the towers in Peter Steinhauer's photographs possess an almost sculptural quality. These temporary facades may serve a practical purpose, but their vibrant colors and geometric surfaces produce a mesmerizing contrast with the surrounding skyline.\n\nThe sight of buildings draped in bright nylon mesh is a common one in Hong Kong. Construction companies use the fabric to keep debris from falling to the ground. Workers also continue to use bamboo scaffolding, which serves as a frame for the colorful wraps.\n\nAmerican photographer Peter Steinhauer has been documenting these construction sites for more than 20 years. He refers to them as \"cocoons,\" alluding to the metamorphosis that buildings undergo while enclosed. And now, 100 of his images will feature in an upcoming book going by the same title.\n\nSteinhauer's varied compositions offer a new perspective on one of the world's most photogenic cities -- atmospheric nighttime shots, wide images of the urban context and close-ups showing the nylon sheets rippling in the wind.\n\n\"I like to get in close and find the graphic elements, he said in a phone interview. \"If you look at the bamboo as it's going up, there's a pattern and design to it. So there are all sorts of design elements and color schemes that all interplay with one another.\"\n\nSteinhauer said his fascination with the phenomenon occurred \"instantaneously\" upon first landing in Hong Kong in 1994.\n\n\"I was stood in a taxi queue (at the airport) just staring at this thing,\" he recalled of seeing a tower block encased in yellow sheets.\n\n\"It was the end of the day, and the light was hitting it at this great angle. It's always brand new material, so there were these vibrant, beautiful colors. It was just stunning, and I thought it was like a giant work of art.\"\n\nAlmost 13 years after taking his first batch of photos, Steinhauer returned to Hong Kong full-time and resumed his project. Having initially photographed in black and white, he decided to switch format in order to capture the subjects' bright coloration.\n\n\"I always gravitated toward the color,\" he said. \"Hong Kong can be a very monochromatic city. The humidity and pollution really wears the paint down and mutes everything. But when you put up this huge blue, green or white thing in the middle of it all, it just pops out -- it jumps off the page.\"\n\nPreserving Hong Kong's past in the miniature\n\nNo matter how attractive they appear from afar, the fabric facades hide a dirty, dusty reality. Steinhauer knows this only too well, having himself been \"cocooned\" when his apartment building underwent renovation.\n\n\"I hated it,\" he admitted. \"There was jackhammering, and the kids were crying the whole time -- we weren't getting any sleep. We had green material around our windows and, because we usually had sun coming in through the windows, this green light was permeating our living room and bedroom at all hours of the day.\n\n\"There are only a few of my photos where I actually show what's happening at ground level -- because it's a mess. It's a construction site.\"\n\nNonetheless, he retains a sense of wonder at a practice that, he said, is documented in photos of Hong Kong stretching back more than 150 years.\n\n\"It's a true art form to me -- one that is really only practiced in Hong Kong, on this scale especially,\" he said. \"It's a remarkable process.\"", "New York (CNN Business) A version of this article first appeared in the Reliable Sources newsletter.

It doesn't matter whether it's a week from the midterms or a year from the midterms. It doesn't matter whether Trump is speaking at a rally or in the quiet dignity of the Roosevelt Room. The president's relish for lies is unchanged, and live television is absolutely no match for the fury with which his falsehoods tumble forth.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "Washington (CNN) The ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee has penned a letter criticizing President Donald Trump's recent rhetoric surrounding a group of migrants currently traveling toward the US border through Mexico.\n\nIn the letter, dated November 1 and addressed to Trump, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island calls on the President to \"demonstrate leadership and strength rather than fear and weakness\" following the administration's announcement earlier this week that 5,200 troops would be deployed to nation's southern border.\n\n\"Your recent pronouncements regarding migrant caravans in southern Mexico mischaracterize the situation, are unlikely to achieve effective border security, and do not reflect the best attributes of our country,\" Reed wrote.\n\nIn an effort to rile up voter enthusiasm, the President has dubbed next week's midterm elections \"an election of the caravan.\"\n\n\"It's going to be an election of the caravan,\" Trump said at a campaign rally in Missoula, Montana, in October. \"You know what I'm talking about.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) As the hours tick down to the critical midterm elections, President Donald Trump continues to focus attention on immigration, casting it as a threat and a cost to American taxpayers.\n\nIn a speech on Thursday afternoon, he made a series of assertions about a group of Central American migrants traveling north together in a group toward the US-Mexico border. Some expected Trump to announce new policies on asylum, but instead he hit on many of the same tropes that have been mainstays of his presidency. We dug into a handful of his claims to check their veracity.\n\nThe President estimated the number of people trying to cross the border illegally\n\nClaim: The President said \"every day above and beyond our existing lawful admission programs, roughly 1,500 to 2,000 people try crossing our borders illegally.\"\n\nFact-check: This is unclear.\n\nAvailable Customs and Border Protection data shows a total of 396,579 people were apprehended by the US Border Patrol for FY 2018 at the southwest border, which would mean an average of 1,087 each day. The numbers differ each month. The highest number of apprehensions of individuals crossing the border illegally was in September, with a daily average of nearly 1,400.\n\nHistorically, CBP has used apprehensions as a measure of illegal crossings.\n\nIf the President is also including the 124,511 individuals deemed inadmissible for entry to the US at lawful ports of entry, the average over the court of the year would be just over 1,400 a day.\n\nThe President talked about violence breaking out between the caravan and Mexican police\n\nClaim: The President said \"it's like an invasion. They have violently overrun the Mexican border. We saw that two days ago ... they have overrun the Mexican police, and they have overrun and hurt badly Mexican soldiers.\"\n\nFact-check: This claim is partially true but misleadingly seeks to smear a group of thousands with the actions of a few.\n\nCNN has reported that there were clashes between one group of migrants and Mexican forces on Sunday.\n\n\"While this group continues its journey, other large groups of Central American migrants are following in their footsteps -- including another group of about 3,000 people who reached the Guatemala-Mexico border on Sunday. The situation quickly spiraled out of control,\" according to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol correspondent Michelle Mendoza, who reported from the scene. Migrants threw rocks and sticks. Mexican forces threw tear gas. In the clashes, a 26-year-old Honduran national, Henry Adalid D\u00edaz Reyes, ended up dead, according to the Guatemalan Attorney General's Office. Authorities are investigating. Several other migrants and police officers sustained minor injuries. Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete condemned the violence, stating that \"aggressors\" had arrived armed with Molotov cocktails. \"The only way to enter Mexico is following immigration laws,\" he said.\"\n\nThe President said Mexico has offered asylum to some members of the caravan.\n\nClaim: \"Mexico has agreed to take them in and encouraged them to stay, but they don't want to stay. They want to come into the United States, so this is no longer safety, and asylum is about safety.\"\n\nFact-check: This is misleading.\n\nCNN has reported some migrants traveling with the caravan have applied for asylum in Mexico.\n\nThe President claims the military is putting up thousands of tents to hold migrants\n\nClaim: The President said, \"We're putting up massive cities of tents. The military is helping us incredibly well with. I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They have been so efficient, so good, so talented, we have thousands of tents. We have a lot of tents.\"\n\nFact-check: This is misleading.\n\nA US defense official speaking on background says there are no plans as of now to build tents for migrants. While the administration has housed unaccompanied children in Tornillo, Texas, the President appears to be talking about tents currently being constructed. On Tuesday, the general in charge of Northern Command, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, said for \"'Operation Faithful Patriot' as it sits right now, the request that we have from Department of Homeland Security and CBP is to build tents to support CBP personnel and our military personnel.\"\n\nThe President talked about how infrequently undocumented immigrants show up for court proceedings after they are released from US custody.\n\nClaim: \"We're not letting them into our country, and they never show up. Almost like a level of 3%. They never show up for the trial, so by the time their trial comes, they are gone.\"\n\nFact-check: Trump is giving the false impression that undocumented immigrants \"never\" Trump is giving the false impression that undocumented immigrants \"never\" show up for court proceedings after they're released from US custody. Through June of this year, 26% of deportation cases were decided in absentia, without the immigrants present, according to the latest statistics from the Justice Department. That means about three-quarters showed up for their hearings. Even the Trump-friendly Center for Immigration Studies noted that most immigrants showed up for court proceedings in 2017.\n\nThe President talked about the number of non-citizens in the country going through certain immigration proceedings.\n\nClaim: \"There are now nearly 700,000 aliens inside the United States awaiting adjudication of their claims.\"\n\nFact-check: This claim is essentially true.\n\nJustice Department statistics show that in 2018 there are 786,303 pending cases with the Executive Office of Immigration Review, the Justice Department body that adjudicates these claims. According to Justice Department, the statistics include removal, deportation, asylum and several other categories of cases.\n\nThe President talked about the scourge of human trafficking, linking it to illegal immigration.\n\nClaim: \"Human trafficking is now at the highest level in the world that it's ever been.\"\n\nFact-check: It is difficult to discern if this is true, in large part because Trump's claim covers all of human history. More than 40 million people are in \"modern slavery,\" according to It is difficult to discern if this is true, in large part because Trump's claim covers all of human history. More than 40 million people are in \"modern slavery,\" according to United Nations figures from 2016. These victims are involved in forced labor, sex trafficking and forced marriages -- shameful practices that disproportionately affect women. They may or may not have been transported across national borders, and may not be considered immigrants (undocumented or otherwise) -- though undocumented people are especially vulnerable to being trafficked.\n\nThe Trump administration has touted its efforts to root out the problem by stepping up prosecutions and supporting legislation to combat online sex trafficking. (On a related note, Trump's comments ignored perhaps the most significant human trafficking episode in history. From the 1500s through the 1800s, as many as 30 million Africans were captured and sold as part of the transatlantic slave trade, according to UN estimates.\n\nThe President gave the impression that the federal government is already starting to build the border wall that he has made a signature priority.\n\nClaim: \"... Including the building of the wall, which we've already started. $1.6 billion spent last year, $1.6 billion this year. We have another $1.6 [billion] that will be coming but we want to build it one time.\"\n\nFact-check: This is misleading. While he's right that $1.6 billion was approved by Congress, this is only a fraction of the $25 billion in requested funds, and the money has mostly gone to repairs, not new construction. By claiming that construction is already underway, Trump appears to be taking credit, as he has in the past, for a project that Customs and Border Protection has been requesting for years and is entirely separate from his well-known proposal to build a wall along the full length of the southern border.\n\nIn San Diego, the federal government is replacing 14 miles of a 46-mile border fence with a stronger wall, but only about half has been replaced so far, according to a CBP spokesman.", "(CNN) President Donald Trump lamented on Thursday that last week's two domestic terror incidents had stopped Republican momentum ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nTrump said the pipe bombs mailed to prominent Democratic politicians and CNN and the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue had taken attention away from the Republican campaign to hold on to control of Congress during the midterms.\n\n\"We did have two maniacs stop a momentum that was incredible, because for seven days nobody talked about the elections,\" he said during his closing remarks at a Missouri rally. \"It stopped a tremendous momentum.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged the human cost of the package bombs and the shooting.\n\n\"More importantly, we have to take care of our people, and we don't care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country,\" he added. \"But it did nevertheless stop a certain momentum, and now the momentum is picking up.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El pr\u00f3ximo 6 de noviembre a partir de las 5:00 p.m. (Miami), CNN en Espa\u00f1ol iniciar\u00e1 su cobertura especial de las elecciones intermedias de 2018 en Estados Unidos, en las que los ciudadanos elegir\u00e1n a 435 miembros de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, 35 esca\u00f1os o un tercio del Senado, y 36 gobernaciones, y oficinas estatales y locales.\n\nJuan Carlos L\u00f3pez, presentador de CNN en Espa\u00f1ol y Director de Pol\u00edtica de los Estados Unidos para la cadena de noticias, liderar\u00e1 la cobertura de la noche desde Atlanta, y contribuir\u00e1 con un an\u00e1lisis profundo a los diferentes espacio de la programaci\u00f3n junto con cinco de los colaboradores pol\u00edticos de la cadena: Al C\u00e1rdenas, Roberto Izurieta, Dan Restrepo, Jorge D\u00e1vila Miguel y Mar\u00eda Cardona.\n\nOn Pres.

Por este motivo, sus palabras, dichas en diferentes momentos, sirven para aproximarse al pensamiento de Bolsonaro, aunque no es lo mismo expresarse como candidato o diputado de un peque\u00f1o partido, que asumir la presidencia y tomar decisiones que pueden alterar el mapa geopol\u00edtico mundial.\n\nSi se toman sus declaraciones a lo largo de los a\u00f1os se puede concluir que -en numerosos aspectos- su discurso parece extra\u00eddo de la llamada \u201cguerra fr\u00eda\u201d de hace 40 a\u00f1os, por su insistencia en querer combatir el comunismo a\u00fan hoy. Por eso no extra\u00f1\u00f3 que en plena campa\u00f1a electoral dijera que \u201cesos rojos marginales ser\u00e1n prohibidos\u201d, en clara alusi\u00f3n a los seguidores del Partido de los Trabajadores, o que uno de sus hijos -tambi\u00e9n diputado- presentara en 2016 un proyecto para criminalizar la propaganda pol\u00edtica que utilice los s\u00edmbolos de la hoz y el martillo.\n\nLo que s\u00ed aparece a todas luces como un gran cambio para la pol\u00edtica exterior es el realineamiento expl\u00edcito con Estados Unidos. Aunque los gobiernos del Partido de los Trabajadores nunca tuvieron un sesgo antiestadounidense y Barack Obama no ahorraba elogios a la figura de Lula, s\u00ed es cierto que Lula apost\u00f3 a un mundo multipolar estrechando los v\u00ednculos con los pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, el mundo \u00e1rabe, Africa y la Rep\u00fablica Popular China.\n\nEn apariencia, y siempre seg\u00fan su dichos, Bolsonaro quiere privilegiar los v\u00ednculos con Estados Unidos y el Estado de Israel. Por eso, no extra\u00f1\u00f3 que planteara el traslado de su embajada en Israel de Tel Aviv a Jerusal\u00e9n -en sinton\u00eda con Washington- aunque esto afecte la relaci\u00f3n con los pa\u00edses \u00e1rabes, que representan una cuota importante del comercio brasile\u00f1o.\n\nPero la pol\u00edtica exterior de un pa\u00eds no es solo ideolog\u00eda, sino que suele ser una combinaci\u00f3n de ideolog\u00eda y negocios. Hoy, la Rep\u00fablica Popular de China es el principal socio comercial de Brasil y desde Beijing manifestaron su disgusto con el viaje que Bolsonaro realizara como candidato presidencial a principio de a\u00f1o a Taiw\u00e1n. Y a nadie se le escapa que Estados Unidos es muy cr\u00edtico de la importante presencia de China en Am\u00e9rica Latina.\n\nLa elecci\u00f3n de Bolsonaro le puede dar a la derecha latinoamericana la posibilidad de encontrar el liderazgo fuerte que le faltaba para hacerle frente a la corriente progresista que se consolid\u00f3 en los primeros a\u00f1os de este nuevo siglo. Varios pa\u00edses condenaron al gobierno de Nicol\u00e1s Maduro con la intenci\u00f3n de aislarlo regionalmente, pero quien trata de liderar su aislamiento es Luis Almagro, el secretario general de la OEA, que no tiene el peso espec\u00edfico de un presidente.\n\n\u00bfQuerr\u00e1 Bolsonaro ejercer un lugar de liderazgo en la regi\u00f3n?

El encuentro ocurri\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de que \u00e9l cancelara un par de apariciones en \"New Day\" y de que me diera la impresi\u00f3n de que estaba evitando que lo entrevistara. Llam\u00e9 a su oficina con la esperanza de que su secretaria de muchos a\u00f1os pudiera aclararme si el se\u00f1or Trump estaba molesto por algo. Me pidi\u00f3 que le diera una semana para averiguarlo. Me llam\u00f3 a los 20 minutos. \"El se\u00f1or Trump desea verla ma\u00f1ana. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tal a las tres de la tarde?\".\n\nUnos a\u00f1os antes, entrevistaba a Donald Trump con frecuencia. En ese entonces, yo presentaba un programa matutino en la cadena Fox News y Trump era una figura del mundo inmobiliario y un astro de los \"reality shows\". Los productores de Fox le hab\u00edan dado un espacio semanal para que en el programa \"Fox & Friends\" diera su opini\u00f3n, generalmente acerca de lo mal que los pol\u00edticos hac\u00edan las cosas. En aquel tiempo, Trump contemplaba lanzarse a la presidencia, aunque pocos cre\u00edamos que realmente lo har\u00eda.\n\nAl no ser un pol\u00edtico, Trump luc\u00eda despreocupado por el mensaje partidista, la \"correcci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica\" o los puntos de debate. No parec\u00eda estar casado con ninguna ideolog\u00eda en especial, ya que adoptaba puntos de vista de todo el espectro pol\u00edtico, tejiendo una plataforma que no era dem\u00f3crata ni republicana, sino trumpiana.\n\nSus apariciones siempre disparaban los niveles de audiencia, que sol\u00edan ser los m\u00e1s altos de la ma\u00f1ana. As\u00ed es c\u00f3mo se cre\u00f3 una din\u00e1mica circular: los productores invitaban a Trump, se disparaban los niveles de audiencia, volv\u00edan a invitarlo. No eran entrevistas dif\u00edciles. Debido a que Trump no era un pol\u00edtico y como mi jefe de entonces, Roger Ailes, no ten\u00eda ninguna intenci\u00f3n de poner a los republicanos en una situaci\u00f3n delicada, tratamos a Trump como si fuera un experto y lo dejamos hablar sin comprobar la veracidad de sus afirmaciones. Intent\u00e9 poner en duda algunas de sus opiniones, como la de cuestionar el lugar de nacimiento de Barack Obama, pero eso no le impidi\u00f3 seguir haciendo declaraciones escandalosas ni convenci\u00f3 a los productores de no invitarlo m\u00e1s.\n\nEn mayo de 2016, todo era distinto. Ya era la presentadora del programa matutino de noticias de CNN, llamado \"New Day\", y Donald Trump era candidato a la presidencia de Estados Unidos. En CNN, no dej\u00e1bamos pasar afirmaciones de los candidatos sin comprobar su veracidad. As\u00ed que, por ejemplo, durante una entrevista conmigo, cuando Trump asegur\u00f3 que nunca se opuso a que las tropas estadounidenses fueran a Afganist\u00e1n, tuve que corregirlo. \u00c9l hab\u00eda sostenido que la invasi\u00f3n de EE.UU. a dicho pa\u00eds hab\u00eda sido un error. Le le\u00ed en vivo sus propias palabras, literalmente. \u00c9l insisti\u00f3 en que nunca dijo eso, a pesar de que yo ten\u00eda la transcripci\u00f3n.\n\nLa tarde en que llegu\u00e9 a la Torre Trump para nuestra reuni\u00f3n, no sab\u00eda por qu\u00e9 Donald Trump ya no quer\u00eda que lo entrevistara. Pens\u00e9 que quiz\u00e1s se deb\u00eda a un malentendido. Quer\u00eda saber qu\u00e9 le imped\u00eda ir a nuestro programa y, de ser posible, solucionarlo.\n\nMe atendi\u00f3 su recepcionista, quien me dijo que el se\u00f1or Trump estaba ocupado y que podr\u00eda tardar. Acababa de sentarme en la sala de espera cuando su asistente apareci\u00f3 y me dijo \"ya est\u00e1 listo\".\n\nEntr\u00e9 en la gran oficina del se\u00f1or Trump y lo encontr\u00e9 almorzando en su escritorio. Se levant\u00f3 para saludarme y me extendi\u00f3 un abrazo tal y como lo hab\u00eda hecho varias veces en Fox. Me dijo que pens\u00f3 en hacerme esperar en el vest\u00edbulo mientras almorzaba, pero que luego pens\u00f3 \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 diablos? Es solo Alysin\".\n\nEstuvimos bromeando, sobre todo por su sorpresa ante la facilidad con la que iba ganando en el bando republicano. Luego fue al grano. Me dijo que se hab\u00eda alegrado por m\u00ed cuando obtuve el trabajo en CNN. \"Estoy tan orgulloso de ti\", fue c\u00f3mo lo dijo. Pero ahora sent\u00eda que yo estaba \"siendo mala\" con \u00e9l. Le pregunt\u00e9: \"\u00bfC\u00f3mo as\u00ed?\" Quer\u00eda saber. Me contest\u00f3: \"Solo dices cosas feas de m\u00ed todo el tiempo y me pregunto \u00bfqu\u00e9 le pas\u00f3? Es como si engatusaras a la gente para decir cosas feas de m\u00ed\".\n\n\"\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo? \u00bfC\u00f3mo?\", repliqu\u00e9. Quer\u00eda saber. No pudo darme ejemplos. Solo se sent\u00eda de esa manera.\n\nFue all\u00ed cuando me di cuenta de que era necesaria una clase sobre la libertad de prensa. Le expliqu\u00e9 que las reglas hab\u00edan cambiado. Que \u00e9l ahora era un candidato presidencial y que yo era la presentadora de un programa de noticias en una cadena de noticias, no la anfitriona de un show matutino que no ten\u00eda que seguir normas y pr\u00e1cticas period\u00edsticas.\n\n\"Mi tarea ahora es resaltar la hipocres\u00eda de funcionarios electos y/o candidatos. Tengo que sacar a la luz las contradicciones en las declaraciones p\u00fablicas y las promesas de los candidatos\". Me inclin\u00e9 hacia adelante desde el otro lado de su mesa para insistir en mis puntos. \"Los periodistas deben vigilar a los gobiernos, no ser sus lacayos. Ese es nuestro trabajo. Comprendo que le guste m\u00e1s un art\u00edculo suave, pero estas son las grandes ligas y el juego ha cambiado\".\n\nMarqu\u00e9 una pausa para ver si mis palabras surt\u00edan efecto. Entonces, \u00e9l repiti\u00f3 \"pero eres tan mala conmigo ahora\". En ese momento su tel\u00e9fono son\u00f3 y puso a su hijo en altavoz, dici\u00e9ndole que me saludara. Lo interpret\u00e9 como el fin de mi entrevista.\n\nNuestro encuentro termin\u00f3 con Trump anotando mi n\u00famero de celular y prometiendo que me llamar\u00eda cuando tuviera tiempo para una entrevista en c\u00e1mara. Pero sab\u00eda que eso no era muy probable. Entend\u00ed que mientras me ci\u00f1era a las reglas del periodismo, mi acceso al futuro presidente se evaporar\u00eda.\n\nPens\u00e9 mucho en ese encuentro la semana pasada. Pens\u00e9 en Trump sinti\u00e9ndose herido por las palabras que consideraba da\u00f1inas, incluso mientras lo o\u00eda insultar una vez m\u00e1s a CNN, incluso despu\u00e9s de que nuestra oficina de correos recibiera un artefacto explosivo, al parecer de uno de sus trastornados seguidores. Y cuando, en un acto de campa\u00f1a, el se\u00f1or Trump se deleit\u00f3 una vez m\u00e1s con las consignas desagradables de la multitud sobre Hillary Clinton, incluso despu\u00e9s de que ella fuera el blanco de una bomba de fabricaci\u00f3n casera.\n\nNunca hubiera podido predecir en esa reuni\u00f3n en la Torre Trump que nos encontrar\u00edamos aqu\u00ed, con el presidente de Estados Unidos culpando a la prensa, sin asumir responsabilidad por el tono t\u00f3xico de su ret\u00f3rica. Nunca hubiera podido predecir que al final de una semana tr\u00e1gica y sangrienta, un mandatario de EE.UU.hubiera afirmado que las palabras dolorosas solo importan cuando \u00e9l las recibe, no cuando las dice. Nunca hubiera cre\u00eddo que el hombre m\u00e1s poderoso del mundo pensar\u00eda que sus propias palabras no tienen poder.", "(CNN) The US military accused Russia on Thursday of blocking the delivery of critical aid to the Rukban refugee camp in Syria, a desert camp that the United Nations has described for months as in a \"desperate\" situation.\n\n\"Russia has again refused to support a UN delivery of humanitarian assistance from Damascus to the Rukban internally displaced persons camp despite US security guarantees,\" US Navy Capt.

More and more of the papers are going out of business altogether. As a result there is less vetting of candidates and more confusion about what's even on the ballot.\n\n\"There's been a huge diminishment of what is available, especially in terms of public service journalism, the very sort of journalism that you need as you're going into a very crucial election and need to decide what issues are important,\" said Penny Abernathy, the lead author of a new report, \"The Expanding News Desert.\"\n\nAbernathy shared her findings on this week's \"Reliable Sources\" podcast. Over the past decade and a half, the number of regional papers that would typically carry coverage of local and state races has drastically decreased, leaving voters without a steady stream of stories about candidates and propositions.\n\nAbernathy's report --\u2014 released by University of North Carolina's Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media \u2014 found that the US has lost almost 1,800 newspapers since 2004, including more than 60 daily newspapers and 1,700 weekly newspapers. Other papers have become \"ghosts,\" shells of their former selves, the report pointed out.\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nJournalism veteran Tom Stites popularized the term \"news desert\" in a 2011 column for NiemanLab . \"The Chicago journalist Laura S. Washington introduced me to the desert frame, and she credits a South Side community organizer for originating it,\" he wrote.\n\nThey took the well-known idea of a \"food desert\" -\u2014 urban areas in which nutritious food is unaffordable or difficult to find \u2014 and applied it to regions in which news and information is in short supply.\n\n\"A huge part of the American people, the less-than-affluent majority, is civically malnourished due to the sad state of U.S. journalism \u2014 and that the nation's broad electorate is thus all but certainly ill informed,\" Stites wrote.\n\nSeven years later, Stites is even more certain. In an interview with CNN, he likened the collapse of local papers to an \"earthquake.\"\n\nAnd reams of research show that newspaper closures affect civic engagement in all sorts of ways. The impacts on elections, Stites said, are likely more significant at the state Senate and House level than at the congressional district level.\n\nCandidates for US Congress and governors' mansions still generate a baseline level of news coverage. But state Senate seats? Mayoral races? Ballot propositions? Some of these go unnoticed.\n\nStites, now the founder of the Banyan Project , lives in a Massachusetts town that still has a daily paper. But in nearby Haverhill, he said, \"Twenty years ago, it had two daily papers that were competing like mad and beating each others' brains out. Haverhill now has only two reporters total.\"\n\nThe result? \"A lot of people really don't know what's going on,\" Stites said.\n\nAmericans have new tools in their hands -- cell phones with access to Facebook and other websites -- but social networks don't fill the void left by local reporters. If anything, these sites just create even more confusion.\n\nWithout independent reporting about candidates, \"you're left with whatever comes in the direct mail and what you happen to see from your friends on a Facebook page,\" Abernathy said.\n\nAbernathy not only studies this problem, she sees it happening first-hand in her hometown.\n\nShe grew up on a farm in Scotland County, North Carolina, a rural part of the state near the border with South Carolina. Back then, her family had access to TV stations in Charlotte and Raleigh, as well as three regional newspapers and an independent local newspaper.\n\nBut when Abernathy moved back to the state in 2008, after being away for 30 years, she was surprised by just how much local news sources had diminished.\n\n\"I'm most definitely in a news desert,\" she said.\n\nThe only local TV station signals she receives are in South Carolina, which means they rarely if ever cover North Carolina races. The local paper has suffered at the hands of multiple different owners. And the regional papers in the state have \"pulled out\" of her area, she said.\n\n\"Even though I go looking for the information, it's still very very difficult to access,\" she added, pointing out the proliferation of paywalls.\n\nAbernathy, a former executive at The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, understands why the sites are trying to charge subscriptions. But as a practical matter, she said, \"if we are going to rely on readers to pay for the news that we create, we're only going to be able to offer it to the most affluent areas.\"\n\nAbernathy pointed to the 2008 recession as a significant factor in local news deterioration. After 2010, especially, she said, the retail base supporting local journalism was \"wiped out.\" Profit margins of local papers shrank while tech giants like Google and Facebook took over the advertising marketplace.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that when a community loses a local paper or a regional paper pulls out of a rural market, voter participation drops.\n\n\"This is bigger than a news industry problem,\" Abernathy said. \"This is a problem for democracy.\"\n\nHistorically, the editorial boards of local and regional papers have also interviewed candidates and made recommendations about how to vote. Abernathy's parents used to tear the voting guides out of the Charlotte Observer and bring the information with them the ballot box.\n\nThey \"depended on them to vet lesser well-known state offices such as the commissioner of agriculture, such as the state treasurer, such as the state auditor,\" she said.\n\n\"It was not just a matter of saying 'vote for this person, vote for that person,'\" she added. \"They actually sat down with the candidate and reviewed where they stood on various issues and made a point in the editorials of saying 'this is why we're recommending this person.'\"\n\nBut so much of that local-level work is missing now. Digital startups get lots of attention, but in most communities there's still something fundamentally missing.\n\nIn North Carolina, for instance, \"I'm an informed resident who wants to make a good decision,\" Abernathy said. \"I want to see where candidates stand and... it's very difficult for me to even go looking for it in an educated way.\"", "CNN's Jake Tapper, in partnership with FactCheck.org , fact-checks President Donald Trump when he says social media is \"my form of telling the truth.\"", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

W. Bush in the 1988 presidential campaign. The scowling image of Horton, a convicted murderer and rapist, was shown all across America. The ad, which was shocking at the time, was credited with sinking the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.\n\nBut this is a different America and a different President. Will it have the same impact?\n\nMaybe not, and here's why.\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush was a patrician politician who was never known as a racial demagogue. He was lampooned in Saturday Night Live sketches as a nerdy wimp. There was a shock element at the time that supporters of the Bush campaign would release such a blatantly racist ad.\n\nIs anyone shocked that Trump would release such an ad?\n\n\"This has been Donald Trump's playbook for so long,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told CNN's \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\nTrump's ad comes a week before the midterm elections. Trump and the conservative media machine have been on a tear recently, warning Americans about the migrants headed north. They've implied that these migrants might have rabies and smallpox and they may be infiltrated with Middle Easterners and gang members.\n\nIf any other President said this, it could have ended their political career. But this is already a President who said African immigrants come from \"shithole\" countries, who once suggested that some Mexican immigrants were \"rapists,\" and who started his political career with a racist conspiracy theory that suggested that the nation's first black President was actually born in Kenya and forged his birth certificate.\n\nDoes this new ad from Trump really shock anyone?\n\nTrump has often been called the first \"Reality TV\" president. It's long been noted that he knows how to say outrageous things and concoct colorful bad guys to keep his base and the media riled up.\n\nBut commentators have recently noted that his rallies are being held at smaller venues and have not drawn the crowds they once did; and he's losing support in the Midwestern states that propelled him into the Oval Office. After Trump recently said he might revoke birthright citizenship, some commentators said all Trump has left to offer is \"racial panic.\"\n\nTrump may now be on the verge of being that Reality TV star who is losing his ratings because he can no longer shock anymore.\n\nThere will probably always be a segment of Americans who respond to raw racial appeals. But racism has more impact when it's cloaked.\n\nRacism, of course, was never \"boring\" to many, such as the victims of lynchings. Yet there was a time when white supremacy was woven so deeply into the fabric of ordinary American life that it seemed almost mundane, just another part of ordinary life.\n\nThat's part of the reason why the Horton ad was so effective -- it was cloaked. It was positioned as a he's-not-tough-enough-on-crime attack against a candidate, when it was really saying he's a wussy liberal who won't protect your family against the big bad black man.\n\nTrump's recent ad and his recent rhetoric take away that cloak.\n\nBut more than anything, through the sheer volume of repetition, it can cause people to tune Trump out. And when they tune you out, that is perhaps the worst thing that can happen to a man like Trump.\n\nRacism works best when it's cloaked. Make it too raw and repeat it too much and we may soon find out that what once worked in 1988 will no longer persuade most Americans.\n\nWe'll find out next week if this is true.", "(CNN) Chris Cornell's doctor is to blame for the Soundgarden singer's death, his family states in a lawsuit filed Thursday.\n\nDr. Robert Koblin \"negligently and repeatedly\" prescribed \"dangerous mind-altering controlled substances\" that impaired Cornell and \"caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life,\" according to the lawsuit obtained by CNN.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\nChris and Vicky Cornell in 2012\n\nThe rock star had a history of substance abuse and chemical dependency.

The pair left Guatemala with Yesenia's husband, Ernesto, and their 4 and 6-year-old daughters. Ernesto had recently lost his job and Yesenia was unemployed, and they were afraid of not being able to provide basic necessities for their daughters. Although the couple admitted that it had been difficult to read the news that President Donald Trump would send troops to the border, they hoped to request asylum in the US and prayed that God would help the President understand the hardships they had lived through.\n\nYesenia, who had delivered via C-section, was unable to carry anything except Rachel, and she and Rachel depended on the kindness of strangers to give them a ride while her husband walked long, hot miles each day pushing the other two girls in a stroller. Were Rachel, Yesenia and their family the \"bad thugs\" and \"gang members\" of the migrant caravan that Trump had warned of on Twitter?\n\nThey were not -- in fact, they were representative of the roughly 3,500 migrants of the caravan, of which an estimated 2,300 are children, according to UNICEF. The truth about this migrant caravan is that it is made up of grandparents, parents and children, of individuals fleeing such a level of violence and poverty that they are ready, like Yesenia, to walk and hitchhike thousands of miles in hopes of finding a new life further north.\n\nThe caravan, which had about 7,000 members when it began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras on October 12, continues to shrink. This is, in part, because, according to the United Nations refugee agency, around 1,500 migrants have requested asylum in Mexico, while others in the face of sickness or injury are sometimes forced to turn back. By the time the migrant caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, the numbers will likely drop further.\n\nA group of women, including a mother and daughter, rest on the side of the road and share water en route to Juchit\u00e1n, Oaxaca.\n\nAs I interviewed members of the caravan while they moved from Niltepec, Mexico to Juchit\u00e1n, Mexico, I met families with babies and young children, pregnant women, adolescents looking for work, and old men and women with severe, oozing blisters. Almost everyone was wearing flip flops, hardly the ideal footwear for terrorists, as the President had suggested , and not one of the people I met was from the Middle East, yet another claim made by Trump without any seeming evidence to back it up. Even he later admitted \"there's no proof\" to the claim.\n\nI observed residents of a working-class neighborhood in Juchit\u00e1n, who despite living in homes with dirt floors in an informal settlement, organized to provide both food and showers to the migrants, who they called their brothers and sisters. They want to support the migrants if they choose to request asylum in Mexico, which some could do, or to go on to the US, where many migrants have at least some family members.\n\nThe migrants were provided shelter in an old bus station, and community volunteers and aid organizations like the Red Cross handed out blankets, clothes and medicine.\n\nIsaac, 2, is traveling with his mother Paola, 22, and his brother Carlos, 3, from San Pedro Sula, Honduras. They have been walking with the migrant caravan since it began.\n\nThat night, I met 4-month-old Esmerelda, who was nestled between her mother Kayla's legs. The two had walked from Santa B\u00e1rbara, Honduras, and along the way kind citizens had given Kayla diapers and milk for the baby. Kayla, like so many others in the caravan, wanted to escape extreme poverty and a country in which daughters like her own were often forced to quit elementary school to work and help support the family.\n\nPaola, 22, a single mother, had traveled from San Pedro Sula, Honduras with her sons age 2 and 3. She left Honduras because she wanted to be able to offer her sons a better life, one in which violent gangs like MS-13 were not a part of their daily reality. Her mother lived in Canada and she hoped to start a new life there.\n\nLillian, a young mother wearing a hat to combat temperatures that hovered around 100 degrees during the day, was traveling with her 1-year-old son, Tiago, and her husband. As she stood on the side of the road with Tiago in her arms, she talked about her husband, a farmer, and how difficult his work had become due to water scarcity and extreme temperatures. Their family was among many migrants propelled to move by climate change. They had sold everything except her child's clothes to have money for the journey. They wanted to request asylum in the US, but their dream was to one day return to Tegucigalpa, Honduras and build a house.\n\nLillian from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is traveling with her son Tiago, 1, and she has worn flip flops, often the only shoes migrants can afford.\n\nAs I stood in the old bus station surrounded by a sea of humanity that night, I saw kids playing with balloons, girls from plates heaped with beans and tortillas, babies sleeping soundly, community members handing out diapers, and volunteers setting up a viewing of the movie \"Coco\" powered by solar energy.\n\nI met a single mother and her four children who had fled the political unrest in Nicaragua, a country where over 300 people were killed in protesting the government's decision to cut pensions. When I met her, she was standing in the grass trying to brush her youngest daughter's hair.\n\nI also met a US pediatric doctor who had spent a week volunteering with the caravan, and who said that it was irresponsible for Trump to call members of the migrant caravan criminals.\n\n\"Don't treat them like criminals,\" he said. \"So much of the blame for this migration falls on the United States.\"\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAlthough President Trump has suggested he may limit how many migrants can apply for asylum, according to US and international law, these migrants all have the right to request asylum at the US-Mexico border. Members of the migrant caravan, who have suffered more than most US citizens can imagine, must be given the opportunity to go through the legal process that will determine if they get to stay in the US.\n\nAt heart, we have always been a nation of immigrants, a nation that has faith in our institutions and that has provided refuge to those fleeing extreme violence and poverty. Trump has tried to erode that faith and turn a hungry, tired mass of migrants with sunburned faces and bleeding feet into something to fear. Regardless of whether Trump actually sends 15,000 troops to the border, the migrants that I talked to said they would always be more afraid of hunger and death than of a president who disliked them based on the color of their skin.", "Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner are the authors of the new book, \"The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) With the midterm election almost here and President Donald Trump piling one outrageous act on another, controversies that might otherwise blaze for days are being forgotten. One that should remain in our minds is the appearance of a make-believe rabbi at a campaign event Mike Pence headlined in Michigan. It was, in the words of a real rabbi, Jason Miller, \"an insulting political stunt.\" That it occurred days after an anti-Semite allegedly killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue made it far worse.\n\nMichael D'Antonio\n\nPeter Eisner\n\nAt the rally, the vice president announced that he was \"privileged to be joined today by a leader in the Jewish Community here in Michigan.\" The \"rabbi,\" Loren Jacobs, donned a Jewish prayer shawl and invoked Jesus, with a reference to his Hebrew name -- Yeshua. As if this signal wasn't enough, he noted that Yeshua is \" Jesus the messiah ,\" but failed to mention the 11 victims of the massacre by name.\n\nWith little effort, anyone can go to the Internet and discover that Jacobs is not a rabbi but an evangelical Christian whose main religious education was obtained at the Moody Bible Institute, a Christian school that trains people to spread the faith around the world.\n\nHowever, as an evangelical Christian well-versed in the culture of his faith, Pence would not have needed to do any research. All he had to do was listen to Jacobs in order to grasp what was going on.\n\nPence surely knew that a \"rabbi\" who worships Jesus as the messiah is actually impersonating a rabbi, and that, when Jacobs took the stage and began speaking at the rally, he was offending many Jewish Americans . Pence aides deflected responsibility for this by noting that a local Jewish politician, Lena Epstein, had actually invited Jacobs to participate. But on a night so close to the tragedy in Pittsburgh, at the very least, Pence would have earned high marks by saying a corrective word. He did not.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) \u2014 These days, you can customize your car, your house and your clothes.

This is the peak time of the year for seasonal flooding known as acqua alta, or high water, in the city.\n\nFlooding at high tide has become much more common in Venice because of climate change -- a problem that will continue to worsen as seas rise because of increasing temperatures and melting ice sheets, according to CNN meteorologists.\n\nWork to install innovative underwater flood barriers to protect Venice from serious flooding, known as the Moses Project, has been underway for years.

They're a tried-and-true way to paint a political opponent as being soft on crime. And a lot of time they work.\n\nPresident Trump is hoping that he gets similar results for a web video, produced for his campaign, that he tweeted out Wednesday. Many are already calling it the most racist national political ad to come out in 30 years -- since Willie Horton.\n\nWhat was in the Horton ad\n\nThe \"Willie Horton\" campaign ad was produced by supporters of George H.W. Bush for his 1988 presidential campaign against Michael Dukakis.\n\nHorton, an African-American man, was a convicted murderer who raped a white woman and stabbed her partner while furloughed from prison under a Massachusetts program in place when Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, was governor.\n\nThe TV ad is now considered one of the most racially divisive in modern political history because it played into white fear and African-American stereotypes. In it, an off-screen narrator tells the story of Horton's crimes while pictures of Bush and Dukakis and a menacing mug shot of Horton flash across the screen. The narrator notes that Bush supports the death penalty for murderers.\n\n\"Dukakis not only opposes the death penalty, he allowed first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison,\" the narrator says.\n\nThe ad ends with this tag line: \"Weekend prison passes, Dukakis on crime.\"\n\nA potentially explosive attack\n\nBush campaign strategist Lee Atwater knew talking about Horton could be devastating to the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Lee knew that it was powerful. Lee knew that it fit a liberal stereotype that would make a larger point about Dukakis,\" Bush deputy campaign manager Ed Rogers said in the CNN documentary \"Race for The White House: George H.W. Bush versus Michael Dukakis.\"\n\n\"Lee also knew that he could be radioactive with Bush. That if it weren't handled right, Bush wouldn't use it. Bush would declare it off-limits.\"\n\nAfter the independent group's ad aired, Bush's campaign later produced a related spot called \"Revolving Door\" that showed convicts walking in and out of prison as the narrator explained Dukakis' liberal positions on issues like mandatory sentencing for drug dealers without showing or mentioning Horton by name.\n\nDukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich later said the ad featuring Horton succeeded in achieving the GOP's goal, \"which was to make Willie Horton into Dukakis' running mate.\"\n\nThe two ads tarred Dukakis with a soft-on-crime label that he couldn't shake.

Debido al deterioro de su salud, se hab\u00eda retirado de la vida p\u00fablica y apenas sal\u00eda a la calle.\n\nEn los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os vivi\u00f3 con la amargura de presentarse cada semana ante un tribunal, que le hab\u00eda impedido salir del pa\u00eds debido a dos demandas por difamaci\u00f3n agravada y difamaci\u00f3n agravada continuada que interpuso entre 2014 y 2015 el hoy presidente de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente, Diosdado Cabello, contra el diario que editaba. Solo una decisi\u00f3n de un tribunal, que a finales de 2017 lo declar\u00f3 incapaz de afrontar un proceso penal, lo relev\u00f3 de la obligaci\u00f3n de asistir al despacho del juez.\n\nPero ni en esa disminuida circunstancia a Petkoff se lo vio doblegado. Era una demostraci\u00f3n m\u00e1s de su insumiso car\u00e1cter, un rasgo en el que coinciden admiradores y detractores, y de la coherencia de sus ideas. Justo en defensa de ellas decidi\u00f3 oponerse en la d\u00e9cada de 1950 a la dictadura de Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, como tantos otros miembros de la juventud del Partido Comunista de Venezuela, que entonces estaba proscrito y, hasta el final de sus d\u00edas, a todo aquello que contradec\u00eda su vocaci\u00f3n de librepensador.\n\nHijo de b\u00falgaro y polaca, Petkoff hab\u00eda nacido en Maracaibo, estado Zulia, el 3 de enero de 1932. Cerca de all\u00ed, en los predios de un central azucarero donde trabajaba su padre, vivi\u00f3 sus primeros doce a\u00f1os hasta que se mud\u00f3 a Caracas. En la capital de Venezuela se convirti\u00f3 en uno de los pol\u00edticos m\u00e1s legendarios del siglo XX. No lo encumbr\u00f3 tanto el tenor de los hechos que protagoniz\u00f3, sino quiz\u00e1s la par\u00e1bola de su vida. Un viaje que lo llev\u00f3 de la lucha guerrillera y el extremismo hasta las posiciones m\u00e1s moderadas de centroizquierda. Petkoff cre\u00eda en la iniciativa privada y en un Estado que interviniera para corregir las inequidades generadas por el mercado. Fue la primera de sus reinvenciones.\n\nDerrocada la dictadura de P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez en 1958, Petkoff hab\u00eda decidido convertirse en comandante guerrillero para combatir a la clase pol\u00edtica que lleg\u00f3 al poder en las elecciones de 1959. Como tantos otros, Petkoff hab\u00eda sido seducido por la victoria de Fidel Castro y su ej\u00e9rcito de barbudos en Cuba y pens\u00f3 que era posible repetirla en Venezuela. Cuando advirti\u00f3 que no era posible tomar el poder por medio de las armas y que no compart\u00eda el dogmatismo de los reg\u00edmenes comunistas decidi\u00f3 fundar un partido pol\u00edtico, Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), que se planteaba tomar el poder mediante elecciones.\n\nLleg\u00f3 a esa decisi\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de un largo proceso de desencanto y de una sucesi\u00f3n de derrotas militares que, no obstante, consolidaron su leyenda de hombre de acci\u00f3n. Estuvo buena parte de la d\u00e9cada de los sesenta en la c\u00e1rcel, pero con las mismas se fugaba -una vez a trav\u00e9s de un t\u00fanel, otra descolg\u00e1ndose por la ventana de una habitaci\u00f3n del Hospital Militar de Caracas- y pasaba a la clandestinidad. Cuando en 1969 public\u00f3 \u201cChecoslovaquia, el socialismo como problema\u201d, una cr\u00edtica a la invasi\u00f3n de la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica a ese pa\u00eds y que tambi\u00e9n se\u00f1alaba la falta de libertades de los reg\u00edmenes comunistas, tambi\u00e9n se gradu\u00f3 como un intelectual de renombre. El libro tuvo tanta repercusi\u00f3n que Leonid Brezhnev, secretario del Comit\u00e9 Central del Partido Comunista de la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica, excomulg\u00f3 a Petkoff.\n\nEsa ruptura con las mentes m\u00e1s dogm\u00e1ticas de la izquierda represent\u00f3 la consolidaci\u00f3n de la veta m\u00e1s democr\u00e1tica de Petkoff. En los setenta y ochenta fue diputado al Congreso de la Rep\u00fablica, candidato presidencial y, ya en la d\u00e9cada de los noventa, ministro de Planificaci\u00f3n del gobierno de Rafael Caldera (1994-1999). No le tembl\u00f3 el pulso para respaldar una reforma econ\u00f3mica de corte liberal. Sus antiguos camaradas no le perdonaron que se incluyera entre las medidas una nueva ley del trabajo, que elimin\u00f3 la retroactividad de las prestaciones sociales de los trabajadores. En la narrativa del chavismo, Petkoff fue el tr\u00e1nsfuga que le quit\u00f3 los beneficios laborales a los trabajadores. Esa \u201ctraici\u00f3n\u201d fue enmendada en 2013 cuando el entonces presidente Hugo Ch\u00e1vez aprob\u00f3 una modificaci\u00f3n que obligaba a las empresas a retomar el viejo modelo para calcular los pasivos laborales.\n\nDesencantado con el apoyo que su partido, el MAS, le dio a Ch\u00e1vez en las elecciones presidenciales de 1998, Petkoff abandon\u00f3 la organizaci\u00f3n para volver a empezar.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nWhat started as a conversation with a few colleagues over the summer has become a major movement of nearly 370 companies that are encouraging their workers to be citizens and voters first. This year, companies large and small are taking steps to remove work-related barriers through the Time to Vote initiative.\n\nThey are doing things like making Election Day a \"no meetings\" day or, as Patagonia and others are doing, shutting down all US-based operations for the day. These companies employ millions of people who will now have the flexibility needed to cast a vote.\n\nBut not all employees enjoy that same flexibility. It's true that 44% of US companies are giving employees paid time off to vote, but that still leaves a majority of American workers likely to be tied up at work while the polls are open. This can decrease turnout and skew the electorate toward wealthier Americans who tend to have salaried jobs and more flexible schedules. That's why the US government should make Election Day a national holiday. Businesses could plan ahead, knowing employees will be off that day, and employees would have the freedom to vote when it's most convenient for them.\n\nAbout Time to Vote CEOs across the nation want to boost voter turnout, so they're launching initiatives that ensure their employees have time to vote. Check out the full list of companies participating here.\n\nThe government should also create a national vote-by-mail program. Right now, our elections are governed by an enormous patchwork of voting systems, with different sets of rules, technologies, policies and local restrictions in practically every community. This is extremely confusing. It also makes our country vulnerable to those who seek to meddle in our elections and susceptible to anyone seeking to restrict voting rights. A national vote-by-mail initiative would make voting more accessible, more convenient, less expensive, and more secure. And nobody waits in line.\n\nIt's not just up to the government, though. And who knows how long it could be before we see changes like these? Business leaders can lead the way by encouraging employees to vote. In addition to being flexible about work hours to allow employees to get to the polls, companies can make it easier for them to register to vote long before Election Day.\n\nRead More", "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - La situaci\u00f3n sigue complic\u00e1ndose para la Comisi\u00f3n Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala. Seg\u00fan dice la Cicig, el 30 de octubre esta entidad entreg\u00f3 a la Subdirecci\u00f3n de Privilegios e Inmunidades del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores la solicitud de renovaci\u00f3n de visa para el comisionado Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez. Pero, seg\u00fan indica la Cicig, esta solicitud no fue admitida por el personal de esa dependencia de Canciller\u00eda, seg\u00fan manifiestan \"sin raz\u00f3n o justificaci\u00f3n alguna\".\n\nCNN habl\u00f3 con Marta Larra, vocera del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, quien dijo que por ahora no hay respuesta, postura o informaci\u00f3n, sobre lo que manifiesta la Cicig y tampoco se desminti\u00f3 lo sucedido en esa subdirecci\u00f3n.\n\nDesde septiembre del 2017, la Cicig, que durante 10 a\u00f1os ha develado casos de alto impacto en Guatemala, ha sufrido ataques del Gobierno del presidente Jimmy Morales. Los \u00faltimos y m\u00e1s intensos comenzaron desde el 31 de agosto, cuando el presidente Morales anunci\u00f3 que no renovar\u00eda el mandato de la Comisi\u00f3n; cuatro d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de eso, orden\u00f3 a las autoridades de Migraci\u00f3n que se le prohibiera el ingreso a Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez al pa\u00eds. Seg\u00fan el mandatario guatemalteco, Vel\u00e1squez se extralimit\u00f3 en sus funciones. PERO esta decisi\u00f3n de Morales fue revertida por la Corte de Constitucionalidad, aunque Vel\u00e1squez no ha regresado a Guatemala y est\u00e1 por cumplir 2 meses dirigiendo la Cicig desde el exterior.\n\nDurante la campa\u00f1a electoral del entonces candidato Jimmy Morales en 2015, \u00e9l asegur\u00f3 en varias ocasiones que extender\u00eda el mandato de la Cicig. La Comisi\u00f3n fue creada y avalada por varios gobiernos de Guatemala desde el 2006 para acabar con redes clandestinas incrustadas en el Estado de Guatemala, corrupci\u00f3n que seg\u00fan los expertos, es una de las causas principales de pobreza y de pobreza extrema en el pa\u00eds.\n\nAl iniciar su mandato, Morales aparec\u00eda en las conferencias de prensa junto a la entonces fiscal general Thelma Aldana y al Comisionado Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez. Sin embargo, todo cambi\u00f3 cuando a principios del 2017 las autoridades develaron un caso de supuesta corrupci\u00f3n que involucra a familiares de Morales, mismas que se suman a por lo menos 2 acusaciones del Ministerio P\u00fablico hacia el propio presidente guatemalteco por presunto financiamiento electoral il\u00edcito. Ambos expedientes no han prosperado por la negativa del Congreso de Guatemala que impide que el Ministerio P\u00fablico y la Comisi\u00f3n Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala puedan investigar al presidente aunque, hasta este punto, Morales asegura ser inocente de todos los cargos al igual que sus familiares.", "(CNN) There's no question as to what President Donald Trump is trying to do with his new web video featuring a Mexican man bragging about killing two police officers and gleefully pledging to kill more if he ever can.\n\nTrump is trying to use racial stereotypes -- Luis Bracamontes as a crazy Hispanic criminal who slipped through the US border system -- as a way to throw tar on a wide swath of Hispanics, including those currently traveling toward the United States' southern border in a so-called caravan. He's trying to scare people -- Republicans in particular -- to go vote on Tuesday or run the risk of having a whole lot more like Bracamontes coming to America.\n\nIt's the sort of fear-mongering and race-baiting that both needs to be called out and calls back to one of the most notorious negative ads ever run: the Willie Horton commercial . The Americans for Bush arm of the National Security Political Action Committee, which supported President George H.W. Bush against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the 1988 race, ran the ad ostensibly as a commercial on the death penalty, which Bush favored and Dukakis opposed. The \"star\" of the ad was a man named Willie Horton -- an African-American man with a goatee and an Afro. With an image of Horton on screen, a narrator described how Dukakis had allowed Horton out of prison on a weekend pass -- and how Horton had kidnapped a couple, stabbed the man and repeatedly raped the woman.\n\nThe ad was decried -- primarily in the years after it ran -- as playing on the fears of whites that a black man looking like Horton could be out there, in their towns, if Dukakis won.\n\nThe similarity between the two videos is obvious: Both attempt to use a hardened minority criminal to scare people -- primarily white people. But on several other important levels, the comparison between the Willie Horton ad and this new video from the Trump campaign breaks down. Here are a few key differences:\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The Congressional Black Caucus signaled in a letter on Thursday that if Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives, they would like African-American representation in at least one of the top two leadership positions for the party in the chamber.\n\nAn African-American member has never served in either of the top two leadership positions.\n\nThe private letter was sent from the chairman of the caucus, Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, and was prompted by \"much speculation\" about how Democrats will govern if they should assume the majority. Though Richmond praised current leadership, he states that the Congressional Black Caucus' role in the Democratic caucus remains \"inconsistent with our most powerful leadership roles in the House.\"\n\n\"African Americans deserve more than a simple gesture of gratitude -- they deserve representation at the apex of the party's infrastructure,\" Richmond wrote.\n\nRead More", "(CNN)--

WikiLeaks disclosures during the 2016 presidential race, Stone revealed Thursday.\n\n\"What was that this morning???\" Bannon wrote to Stone on October 4, 2016. Earlier that day, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had delivered a speech billed as an \"October surprise\" announcement and had promised additional Clinton-related leaks. But the event turned out to be a publicity stunt where Assange touted his organization's 10th anniversary. All Assange offered was another promise of more materials before the election, angering some Trump supporters who were hoping for a bombshell.\n\nStone replied to Bannon that Assange didn't release any documents out of security concerns. Then Stone wrote, \"However -- a load every week going forward.\"\n\nIn his column Thursday, Stone said this particular prediction was based on publicly available information.\n\n\"More importantly my prediction of 'a load every week going forward' is based on Assange's own public announcement hours before-that there would be weekly releases going through and beyond the election and not any communication with Wikileaks or Assange,\" Stone wrote in his piece headlined \"The Treachery of Steve Bannon.\"\n\nWhile Stone says he still hasn't been contacted by the special counsel, nearly a dozen of his associates have been contacted for interviews with Mueller's team or testimony before the grand jury. Last week, Mueller's team interviewed Bannon for a third time, including about his communications with Stone.\n\nStone's move to publish the emails pre-empted a New York Times story Thursday about Stone's efforts to pitch himself to Trump campaign officials as a WikiLeaks insider.\n\nAt least one campaign official told investigators that Stone told campaign officials he had ties to Assange, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\n\nStone made a variety of pronouncements during the 2016 campaign suggesting he had ties to Assange or advance knowledge about what WikiLeaks was planning to release. The timing of the email exchange between Stone and Bannon could also be of interest to investigators.\n\nDays later, on October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks unveiled the hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.\n\nIt was convenient timing for the Trump campaign. It came about 30 minutes after one of the most damaging moments of Trump's presidential campaign: when a recording became public showing Trump bragging about grabbing women's genitals in previously unaired footage from a 2005 interview with 'Access Hollywood.'\n\nWhile Stone made a show -- publicly and privately -- of bragging about his close ties to Assange during the 2016 campaign, he has since revised his story. Stone said he relied on publicly available information, tips from journalists and a backchannel source -- progressive New York activist and radio host Randy Credico.\n\nCredico, who has been interviewed multiple times by investigators and testified before the grand jury, has denied that he acted as Stone's backchannel.\n\nIt remains unclear what charges Stone could face, if any.\n\nIn a separate email published by The New York Times, Stone encourages Bannon to have Trump campaign surrogates tout a story -- without any evidence -- that Bill Clinton has a love child.\n\nThen he asks Bannon to have GOP donor Rebekah Mercer fund his efforts to spread the Clinton story.\n\n\"I've raise (sic) $150K for the targeted black digital campaign thru a C-4,\" Stone wrote. \"Tell Rebecca to send us some $$$.\"\n\nThe request could run afoul of federal election law. On Thursday, Stone told CNN he never received any money from the Mercers.", "(CNN) Rep. Steve King erupted in anger Thursday when a man compared the Iowa Republican's anti-immigrant views to the views espoused by Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers .\n\nKing, speaking at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, was taking questions at a candidate forum when the man brought up the shooting Saturday at the Tree of Life synagogue, which left 11 dead. King cut the man off and ultimately had him escorted out of the event.\n\nKing has faced recent criticism for his comments denouncing diversity in the United States and immigration, as well as Democratic mega-donor George Soros, in light of the Pittsburgh shooting and a slew of mailed pipe bombs targeting Soros, other prominent Democrats and CNN.\n\n\"The terrorist who committed this crime, he was quoted as saying, 'They bring invaders and they kill our people. I can't sit back and watch our people get slaughtered,' \" the man said as he began to introduce his question.\n\n\"You, Steve King, have been quoted as saying, 'We can't restore our civilization with other people's babies,' \" the man added, quoting a tweet from King last year.\n\n\"You and the shooter both share an ideology that is fundamentally anti-immigration,\" the man said.\n\n\"No, don't you do that,\" King said, interrupting the man. \"Do not associate me with that shooter.\"\n\nKing accused the man of being \"an ambusher,\" which the man said he was not. Iowa Starting Line, a Democratic campaign monitoring site, said the man was a member of the public, not the media.\n\nThe man said he was going to ask what distinguished King's views from those of the shooter.\n\n\"No, you're done, you crossed the line,\" King said. \"It's not tolerable to accuse me to be associated with a guy that shot 11 people in Pittsburgh.\"\n\nKing then referenced his support of Israel.\n\n\"I am a person who has stood with Israel from the beginning, and the length of that nation is the length of my life,\" the Iowa Republican said, pointing his finger at the man. \"And I've been with them all along, and I will not answer your question and I'll not listen to another word from you.\"\n\nKing threatened that the event would be \"over\" if the man continued talking.\n\nThe man calmly asked King, \"Do you identify as a white supremacist?\"\n\nKing raised his voice, saying, \"Stop it!\"\n\n\"Why did you meet with a white supremacist group in Austria?\" the man asked. It was a reference to an interview King did with Unzensuriert , a publication affiliated with Austria's Nazi-founded Freedom Party, in August. In that interview, King said diversity is \"not a strength,\" and asked, \"What does it bring that we don't have that is worth the price?\"\n\n\"This is done,\" King said before asking a guard to escort the man out.\n\n\"Sorry that you couldn't answer my question. ... I was hoping to get a sincere answer,\" the man said while exiting.\n\n\"Stop it! Nobody is going to listen to you, you're gone,\" King shot back. \"We don't behave like that in this country.\"", "\"A tireless champion for voter security,\" President Donald Trump once praised.\n\n\"The architect of voter suppression nationwide,\" and \"vote suppressor in chief,\" critics Ari Berman, an author, and Jason Kander, a politician, have warned.\n\n\"The ACLU's worst nightmare,\" an announcer declared at the start of each episode of Kobach's former talk radio show.\n\nWhen we sat down with Kobach in his Topeka office for a rare interview, we learned he is some of those things and more -- a zealot who believes voter fraud exists and it is his mission to stop it. He is a preacher to the converted. He refuses to acknowledge well-established evidence that voter fraud is extremely rare -- that, for example, stealing someone's identity to vote is less likely than being struck by lightning, as the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law put it.\n\nWhen Trump claimed he would have won the popular vote \"if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" he and White House advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller pointed to Kobach. Since the 2016 election, Trump's repeated assertions of widespread voter fraud have been debunked over and over again.\n\nKobach was also the man Trump tapped to lead his Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. At its first meeting in July 2017, the President declared, \"Any form of illegal or fraudulent voting, whether by non-citizens or the deceased, and any form of voter suppression or intimidation must be stopped... I look forward to the findings and recommendations your report will produce ... the full truth will be known and exposed, if necessary, in the light of day.\"\n\nLess than six months after it convened, the Commission disbanded without ever releasing any findings.\n\nVoting access controversies arise\n\nToday, Kobach is the GOP candidate for governor of Kansas. He's the leading proponent for the strictest voting laws in the nation and a controversial figure featured in the forthcoming CNN documentary, \"Democracy in Peril: The War on Voting Rights,\" premiering Friday, November 2 at 11 p.m.\n\nFor the better part of a year, our team has traveled across the country meeting people at the front lines who work tirelessly in the lead up to election day: the activists, the politicians, the lawmakers, and the academic researchers who study voting. We interviewed older people who have voted in elections for decades but who are suddenly dealing with obstacles in casting their ballot. We met a man who faced years in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines as he was prosecuted for voter fraud. We sat down with plaintiffs bringing their landmark case to the US Supreme Court because of fears their votes will not matter\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the November 6 midterm elections, voting access controversies have been flaring up from coast to coast.\n\nUnder a new requirement in North Dakota, Native Americans must show specific forms of photo ID bearing their street address. The problem is there are few actual street names on the reservations. Many Native American residents receive their mail by P.O. box and do not know their address, much less have a photo ID with it imprinted. Critics say this is an additional layer of bureaucracy that suppresses this community. North Dakota is where Democrat Heidi Heitkamp won her Senate seat by fewer than 3,000 votes in 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED Voter ID rules under scrutiny in North Dakota Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Voter ID rules under scrutiny in North Dakota 04:57\n\nOver the summer, controversy swirled after a proposal to close seven of nine polling places in a majority-black county in Georgia.\n\nA recent CNN investigation found that one suburban Georgia county tossed hundreds of absentee ballots due to discrepancies with birthdates, addresses and matching signatures. Of the 595 rejected absentee ballots in Gwinnett County , more than 300 belonged to African-Americans and Asian-Americans. Last week, a federal court judge ordered Georgia election officials to halt the rejection of absentee ballots due to mismatched signatures.\n\nA struggle in Georgia\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is also the Republican nominee for governor, faces backlash and lawsuits after the Associated Press reported his office suspended more than 53,000 voter applications. Almost 70% were registrations by African-Americans. Kemp's office maintains that those voters will be allowed to vote, most likely by provisional ballot, if they bring the proper ID.\n\n\"What about those low-propensity voters... They don't know they can go to the polls,\" she said. \"They get a confusing letter saying there is something wrong with their registration, and, more than likely, they will sit out this election. The miasma of fear that is created by voter suppression is as much about terrifying people about trying to vote as it is about blocking their ability to do so.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Abrams slams GA opponent over 'voter suppression' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Abrams slams GA opponent over 'voter suppression' 03:58\n\nThe Kemp campaign calls the accusations of voter suppression in Georgia \"bogus\" and points to a \"record high\" of voter registrations and turnout under Kemp's tenure.\n\nIt's the same response Kansas Secretary of State Kobach gives when questioned over the impact of his own state's strict voter ID laws and whether they disenfranchise voters.\n\n\"I'm trying to stop voters from committing fraud, which effectively disenfranchises the people who are voting legitimately... Voter fraud infects the whole system. Not only does it potentially tip a result, you know, to the candidate that didn't actually win the election, it also affects the willingness of people to vote,\" Kobach said.\n\nKobach is a strident believer that measures like requiring photo identification on Election Day and proof of citizenship when registering to vote, plus purging outdated voter rolls, are necessary to maintain election integrity.\n\n'Just part of their strategy'\n\nCritics call them tactics that threaten democracy.\n\n\"Over the course of our history, it has not been exclusively one party that has perpetrated voter suppression. It has been people in power against people who have less power,\" says Jason Kander, a Democrat, former Missouri Secretary of State and founder of the grassroots organization Let America Vote. \"In the modern iteration of voter suppression over about the last two decades, that has been the Republican Party and it's just very plain to see. It's just part of their strategy.\"\n\nIt's not a partisan issue according to Kobach, despite a body of research that shows people of color, the poor and college students are disproportionately affected by these laws.\n\n\"One of the interesting things about the issue of voter fraud and photo ID is that it unfortunately has become partisan,\" Kobach said. \"We all have an interest in making sure that the elections are fair and square.\"\n\nAuthor Ari Berman says the fundamental right to vote is under threat.\n\n\"If it's Democrats doing this to Republicans or Republicans doing this to Democrats, the fact that people are having trouble exercising one of the most fundamental rights in the year 2018 is a huge scandal,\" said Berman, who wrote \"Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America.\"\n\nHundreds of new restrictions\n\nIt's getting increasingly harder to vote in this country. Hundreds of new restrictions in a majority of states have been introduced since 2011. And the US trails most other developed countries in voter turnout.\n\n\"We should be encouraging putting in place measures to make voting easier, getting as many people to the polls as we possibly can, as opposed to restricting and making it more difficult for people to cast a ballot,\" argued former US Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nHe has teamed with former President Obama to create the National Democratic Redistricting Committee to reform the way district voting maps are drawn. It's part of an effort to eliminate partisan gerrymandering, what many call a form of voter suppression.\n\nKobach and other advocates for strict voting laws say their goal \"is not to try to discourage one party or the other from registering,\" but rather to \"make it easy to vote and hard to cheat.\"\n\nThat issue of cheating is at the core of the war on voting rights. We talked to election researchers and experts all around the country. They all agree that there is zero evidence for widespread voter fraud, whether by citizens or non-citizens.\n\nHe claims a bigger mission\n\n\"The argument that there's massive voter impersonation, fraud... It is demonstrably untrue,\" said Kenneth Mayer of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n\"It's a philosophical movement where you have advocates who claim massive levels of voter fraud -- the President for one, Kris Kobach, the Secretary of State in Kansas -- who have been pounding the drums insisting that this is a major problem, and people wind up believing that,\" Mayer said.\n\nIn Kansas, Kobach has claimed there are hundreds of non-citizens on the voter rolls. In 2015, he convinced the state Legislature to make him the only Secretary of State in the country with the power to prosecute election crimes.\n\nIn the three years Kobach has had the authority, 15 people have been charged with voter fraud. Of the 14 convicted, three have been non-citizens, including one in the process of becoming a naturalized citizen who had not been sworn in.\n\nThat's three non-citizens over the course of several elections in a state with 1.8 million registered voters.\n\nBut for Kobach, the mission is much larger than the handful of prosecutions. He claims those numbers are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHe and the disciples of \"voter integrity\" have pledged to continue their crusade in America.", "New York (CNN Business) Some of the largest American companies are taking a stand on transgender rights as President Donald Trump considers a rollback of legal protections for the group.\n\nMore than 50 US companies said Thursday in a letter posted online that they oppose \"any administrative and legislative efforts to erase transgender protections through reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations.\"\n\n\"We call for respect and transparency in policy-making, and for equality under the law for transgender people,\" the letter says.\n\nIt's signed by a number of top tech companies, including Amazon ( AMZN ), Apple ( AAPL ), Facebook ( FB ), Google ( GOOGL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Twitter ( TWTR ), Uber and Lyft.

En @realDonaldTrump el mandatario es fiel a su estilo y publica sin pelos en la lengua, pero tambi\u00e9n \u2014a veces\u2014 sin investigaci\u00f3n ni verificaci\u00f3n. Y lo hace muchas veces en la madrugada, y \u2014parece\u2014 cuando ve alguno de sus programas favoritos en Fox News, comentando alg\u00fan contenido que haya visto en televisi\u00f3n (o respondiendo alg\u00fan reporte de CNN, aunque diga que no ve ese canal), m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que haya sido corroborado por una agencia estatal o alguien del gobierno.\n\nLa actividad en Twitter de Trump, que le sirvi\u00f3 para construir su base electoral durante la campa\u00f1a, es noticia todas las semanas. Esta es una mirada a la herramienta de comunicaci\u00f3n que m\u00e1s le gusta al presidente de Estados Unidos justo antes de que vaya a la que es considerada una gran prueba de su mandato: las elecciones intermedias, que definir\u00e1n si su partido mantiene el control del Congreso y si su campa\u00f1a tiene efecto a favor de los republicanos.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOS N\u00daMEROS\n\nDesde que fue elegido presidente, Trump desde su cuenta personal ha publicado unos cinco mil tuits. Se desglosan as\u00ed, seg\u00fan cifras de Twitter recopiladas con CrowdTangle:\n\nPublica 48 tuits a la semana, en promedio\n\n71,98 % son tuits con solo texto\n\n10,72 % de los tuits tienen enlaces\n\n12,07% tienen videos\n\n4,97% incluyen fotos\n\nPas\u00f3 de tener aproximadamente 15 millones de seguidores el 8 de noviembre de 2016, cuando result\u00f3 elegido, a m\u00e1s de 55 millones en la \u00faltima semana de octubre.\n\n\u2022 Trump publica en promedio 48 tuits a la semana\n\nEso es un crecimiento de 40 millones de seguidores, un crecimiento de 259 %\n\nLa semana que m\u00e1s crecimiento tuvo fue la de su posesi\u00f3n, con 7,51 %\n\nY solo en una semana desde su elecci\u00f3n de hecho ha perdido seguidores: la segunda semana de julio de 2018, con una ca\u00edda de 0,302 %.\n\nEn esa semana arrestaron a Stormy Daniels, Trump public\u00f3 una carta que le envi\u00f3 a Kim Jong Un y dijo que le enviar\u00eda una copia del CD de \"Rocket Man\" y design\u00f3 a Brett Kavanaugh como su candidato a la Corte Suprema de Justicia.\n\nTrump sigue usando de forma prevalente su cuenta personal, a pesar de que al ser elegido tiene a su disposici\u00f3n @POTUS, la cuenta oficial del presidente de Estados Unidos. Por cierto @realDonaldTrump no sigue a @POTUS.\n\n\u2022 Desde que es presidente su cuenta personal tiene 40 millones de seguidores nuevos\n\nEn comparaci\u00f3n, en la cuenta @POTUS Trump solo ha publicado 425 tuits desde que fue elegido, ha aumentado 24% de seguidores (10 millones) y en su mayor\u00eda retuitea publicaciones de la Casa Blanca y la cuenta personal del mandatario.\n\nALGUNOS DE LOS TUITS M\u00c1S ESCANDALOSOS\n\nLa publicaci\u00f3n constante de tuits por parte del presidente expresando sus opiniones personales han dejado un oc\u00e9ano de mensajes llamativos. A diario los medios increpan a la secretaria de Prensa y funcionarios de la administraci\u00f3n sobre las palabras de Trump en esa red, porque, si bien es su cuenta personal, Trump no deja de ser el presidente de EE.UU. y sus mensajes no dejan de ser las posiciones de un jefe de Estado. Estos son algunos de los tuits que m\u00e1s pol\u00e9mica han levantado entre la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica:\n\nFraude electoral... sin pruebas:\n\nEl 27 noviembre 2016 Trump denunci\u00f3 sin pruebas que \"millones de personas\" votaron \"ilegalmente\" por Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump gan\u00f3 el Colegio Electoral y por lo tanto la Casa Blanca, pero la candidata dem\u00f3crata tuvo ventaja en el voto popular por casi tres millones de votos.\n\n\"Adem\u00e1s de ganar en el Colegio Electoral con gran diferencia, gan\u00e9 el voto popular si deducen las millones de personas que votaron ilegalmente\".\n\n\"Adem\u00e1s de ganar en el Colegio Electoral con gran diferencia, gan\u00e9 el voto popular si deducen las millones de personas que votaron ilegalmente\"\n\nIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016\n\nPaliza a logo de CNN:\n\nEl 2 de julio de 2017, la cuenta de Twitter personal del presidente (en ese entonces con 33 millones de seguidores) comparti\u00f3 un video de 28 segundos de una transmisi\u00f3n de la empresa de lucha libre WWE. El video fue editado para mostrar a Trump golpeando a un hombre con un logo de CNN sobre su rostro.\n\nPoco tiempo despu\u00e9s, la cuenta presidencial @POTUS retuite\u00f3 el tuit de Trump a sus 19 millones de seguidores de entonces.\n\nEn un comunicado, CNN consider\u00f3 que era \"un d\u00eda triste cuando el presidente de Estados Unidos alienta la violencia contra reporteros\".\n\nEl tuit fue ampliamente criticado. Varios grupos de libertad de prensa condenaron la publicaci\u00f3n, como el Comit\u00e9 de Reporteros para la Libertad de Prensa, as\u00ed como representantes de medios, como Sean Baquet, editor ejecutivo de The New York Times.\n\nTrump no tiene en cuenta la distinci\u00f3n entre tiempo y clima:\n\nEl 28 de diciembre de 2017, despu\u00e9s de un tercer d\u00eda consecutivo de golf en su resort Mar-a-Lago en Palm Beach, Florida, y con una temperatura fue de 22 grados Celsius, Trump tuite\u00f3:\n\n\"En el Este, podr\u00eda ser la V\u00edspera de A\u00f1o Nuevo M\u00c1S FR\u00cdA. Tal vez podr\u00edamos usar un poco de ese buen y viejo (concepto de) calentamiento global por el que nuestro pa\u00eds, pero no en otros pa\u00edses, iba a pagar BILLONES DE D\u00d3LARES para protegerse. \u00a1Abr\u00edguense!\"\n\n\"En el Este, podr\u00eda ser la V\u00edspera de A\u00f1o Nuevo M\u00c1S FR\u00cdA.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017\n\nLa \"l\u00f3gica\" aqu\u00ed es simple: \u00bfc\u00f3mo puede el cambio clim\u00e1tico, tambi\u00e9n conocido como calentamiento global, ser real si hace tanto fr\u00edo afuera? Lo que Trump no tiene en cuenta en su tuit es que \"clima\" y \"tiempo\" no son lo mismo.\n\nLa NASA explica: \"El tiempo es cu\u00e1les son las condiciones de la atm\u00f3sfera en un corto per\u00edodo de tiempo, y el clima es la forma en que la atm\u00f3sfera se comporta durante per\u00edodos de tiempo relativamente largos\".\n\nQue haga fr\u00edo en cualquier d\u00eda \u2014de la semana, o del mes\u2014 no es indicativo de mucho sobre el clima y si se est\u00e1 calentando o no. Si la l\u00f3gica \"clima = tiempo\" tuviera sentido, tras una serie de sofocantes d\u00edas de verano podr\u00eda concluirse razonablemente como una evidencia incontrovertible de que el planeta se est\u00e1 calentando.\n\nLa prensa es el \"mayor enemigo\" de Estados Unidos:\n\nHoras despu\u00e9s de regresar de un viaje en el que prodigaba elogios a Kim Jon Un el 13 de junio de 2018, Trump declar\u00f3 que el mayor enemigo de Estados Unidos es... \"las noticias falsas\". Mencion\u00f3 a NBC y CNN en su tuit.\n\nSo funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have \u201cbegged\u201d for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Country\u2019s biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2018\n\nTrump frecuentemente llama a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n como sus enemigos. El tuit de ese 13 de junio se remonta a uno de febrero de 2017, cuando llam\u00f3 a varios medios de comunicaci\u00f3n \"\u00a1el enemigo del pueblo estadounidense!\".\n\n\"Muy gracioso ver las noticias falsas, especialmente NBC y CNN. \u00a1El enemigo m\u00e1s grande de nuestro pa\u00eds es las noticias falsas que los tontos promulgan tan f\u00e1cilmente!\"\n\nDesde entonces ha usado esa figura de \"enemigo del pueblo\" para referirse a la prensa en al menos 12 tuits.\n\nReporteros de CNN le han preguntado varias veces a la Casa Blanca sobre estas referencias, y la secretaria de Prensa Sarah Sanders dice que Trump no se refiere a toda la prensa, sino a los medios que publican \"fake news\" o noticias falsas. El 2 de agosto Sanders se neg\u00f3 a decir que los medios no son el enemigo del pueblo y dijo que la posici\u00f3n del presidente era \"completamente comprensible\" a la luz de los \"ataques de la prensa\" contra \u00e9l. El 29 de octubre Sanders dijo que no hab\u00eda que generalizar, pero critic\u00f3 a CNN por se\u00f1alar \u2014dijo Sanders\u2014 a la ret\u00f3rica Trump como un factor en el caso de los paquetes bomba enviados contra pol\u00edticos dem\u00f3cratas ese mes.\n\nCacer\u00eda de brujas:\n\n\"Nuestra relaci\u00f3n con Rusia NUNCA ha estado peor gracias a muchos a\u00f1os de tonter\u00eda y estupidez de EE.UU. \u00a1Y ahora, la ama\u00f1ada cacer\u00eda de brujas!\", tuite\u00f3 Trump el 15 de julio de 2016.\n\nOur relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J.

El Comit\u00e9 de Inteligencia del Senado, que est\u00e1 presidido por el senador republicano Richard Burr de Carolina del Norte, concluy\u00f3 lo mismo a principios de este verano boreal. El fiscal especial Robert Mueller acus\u00f3 a una docena de rusos por sus papeles en lo que el documento de acusaci\u00f3n dej\u00f3 en claro que fue una operaci\u00f3n amplia y profunda para influir en las elecciones presidenciales de Estados Unidos.\n\nRusia adem\u00e1s ha sido objeto de cr\u00edticas en la comunidad internacional por el supuesto envenenamiento de Sergei Skripal por parte de Rusia y la anexi\u00f3n de Crimea.\n\nSUS BLANCOS DE ATAQUES PREFERIDOS\n\nSeg\u00fan un recuento de John Avlon, analista pol\u00edtico de CNN, Trump:\n\nha tuiteado 137 menciones de Barack Obama desde el D\u00eda de la Inauguraci\u00f3n\n\ndesde el D\u00eda de la Inauguraci\u00f3n ha tuiteado 109 ataques contra Hillary Clinton desde que lleg\u00f3 a la presidencia\n\ndesde que lleg\u00f3 a la presidencia ha atacado a CNN 63 veces en Twitter\n\nAdem\u00e1s, seg\u00fan Trump Twitter Archive :\n\n\n\nha hecho 298 cr\u00edticas a medios de comunicaci\u00f3n\n\nha dicho 19 veces que pol\u00edticos \"no tienen ni idea\" incluyendo Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Marco Rubio, Elizabeth Warren, Jeb Bush)\n\nincluyendo Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Marco Rubio, Elizabeth Warren, Jeb Bush) ha hecho 406 menciones, cr\u00edticas, a los dem\u00f3cratas\n\nLAS PELEAS RID\u00cdCULAS CON LAS CELEBRIDADES\n\nDesde que fue elegido presidente ha criticado a personas que no tienen que ver con pol\u00edtica o no son funcionarios electos.

They didn't get to the top of the list until he was a year and a half.\n\n\"They said they would help us,\" says Evans, now 31. \"They didn't.\"\n\nHomeless for the past 15 years, Evans is intimately familiar with the shortcomings of the city's approach to homelessness. Now she's working to promote Proposition C, a tax on the gross receipts of city's largest companies. The revenue from the tax would add $300 million a year to San Francisco's homeless budget, double what it is now. It would fund shelters, mental health services, addiction treatment, and prevention to keep people from becoming homeless.\n\nThe ballot measure has drawn an unusual amount of attention in recent weeks, thanks in part to billionaire CEOs Marc Benioff (Salesforce) and Jack Dorsey (Twitter, Square) arguing about it on Twitter.\n\n. He is a San Francisco native, responsible for the Benioff has become the face of the fight for Prop C . His company is the largest employer in the cityHe is a San Francisco native, responsible for the tallest skyscraper in the city, a major donor to its public schools, and the name on its biggest children's hospital.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff has become the face of the fight for Prop C.\n\nFor the past three weeks, he has promoted the initiative, investing $2 million of his own dollars and nearly $6 million from Salesforce into a Yes on C campaign that includes fliers, Facebook ads and posters around the city. He's given speeches and non-stop interviews and fought with opponents on social media.\n\n\"It's a crisis of homelessness. It's a crisis of cleanliness. But you can also see it's a crisis of inequality,\" Benioff told CNN Business. \"This is a city with 70 billionaires. We have some of the most successful companies in the world. We need a lot more funding, and we need a lot of action now.\"\n\nFew other tech leaders are vocally supporting the measure, but some have quietly donated to the No on C campaign. San Francisco mayor London Breed and companies including Square, Stripe, Lyft and Visa all oppose it. The main talking points against Prop C are that it lacks accountability, doesn't give the new mayor a chance to implement her own plan first, and throws more money at an issue when money doesn't appear to have made a difference in the past.\n\nBut at the heart of the debate for tech companies is a little known tax rule that would cause some to pay more money. Companies like Square and Stripe that handle payments are considered \"financial services\" companies by the city of San Francisco instead of technology companies. The city's treasurer is responsible for the classification, which predates the fight over Prop C.\n\nA recent study by San Francisco's Office of Economic Analysis found that the impact on the job market and economy would be small. But Dorsey previously indicated the tax issue could eventually lead to his companies relocating.\n\nAndrew Loy begs along a sidewalk in downtown San Francisco, California in June 2016. Homelessness is on the rise.\n\n\"We're happy to pay our taxes,\" Dorsey said in a tweet earlier this month. \"We just want to be treated fairly with respect to our peer companies, many of whom [sic] are 2-10x larger than us. Otherwise we don't know how to practically grow in the city. That's heartbreaking for us as we love SF and want to continue to help build it.\"\n\nBenioff isn't interested in the nuance of tax codes. In tweets and numerous interviews, he has framed the issues in dramatic and stark terms. You are either for helping the homeless or you are against it. He's accused other CEOs of not giving enough back to the city or to charities, and said the mayor calls to ask him for money for homeless programs. Most of Benioff's opponents have gone quiet, realizing that trying to debate details about Prop C in public with its biggest supporter isn't effective.\n\n\"The people who give are always the people who give,\" said Benioff. \"The people who take are always the people who take, and it's really turned into two buckets. Those who are willing to help and those who aren't. Anyone who does not want to give back, I will help pack their boxes.\"\n\nThe proposition was in the works long before Benioff joined the cause. It was created by the Coalition on Homelessness , a 31-year old organization that works on policy and directly with San Francisco's homeless population. Its office is only 1.3 miles from the gleaming new Salesforce tower, but it exists in a different world. A cluttered second floor space in the heart of the Tenderloin neighborhood, it looks out onto sidewalks frequented by the homeless people that it is trying to help.\n\nCoalition of Homelessness executive director Jennifer Friedenbach says it saw an opening after the Trump tax cut lowered taxes for local companies. The group looked at previously unsuccessful measures in San Francisco and other cities while developing Prop C.\n\n\"What we were finding was we needed to go big and we needed to go bold, we needed to target the folks who would be most able to pay,\" said Friedenbach.\n\nFor example, a recently failed Seattle proposition included a \"head tax\" that would tax companies like Amazon based on their number of employees. Prop C is based on gross receipts of corporate revenue. To avoid hurting small businesses, it only affects companies with more than $50 million in revenue a year. The tax averages out to 0.5% a year \u2014 just big enough to make a difference, but supposedly not enough to hurt the companies or lead to layoffs.\n\n\"This is one half of one percent, it's immaterial ... these numbers are so small, they mean nothing to these companies,\" said Benioff. \"For them to squawk over or to complain and say that they won't give $10 million or $20 million to the number one issue in the city, really calls into question their motives for being in business at all.\"\n\nAfter years of bouncing between shelters, cars, and the street, Jackie Evans recently moved into her own home. She's hopeful Prop C will finally improve the city's homelessness issues because it was created by working with the people in the thick of the crisis, like herself.\n\n\"Having more money means helping more people,\" said Evans.", "(CNN) The Trump administration is stepping up its efforts to target China over economic espionage, simultaneously announcing a new initiative to combat trade theft and charges involving alleged crimes against an Idaho semiconductor company.\n\nThe Department of Justice unsealed an indictment Thursday alleging a state-backed Chinese firm, a Taiwanese company, and three Taiwanese individuals committed conspiracy to steal trade secrets from Micron, which makes memory chips.\n\n\"Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing \u2014 and it has been increasing rapidly.

And yet ExxonMobil's oil production keeps shrinking.\n\nExxon's output has declined in eight of the past nine quarters . America's largest oil company is expected to disclose another dip on Friday when it reports third-quarter results.\n\nThe trend is surprising given the shale oil boom that has turned the United States into an energy powerhouse . US oil output topped 11 million barrels a day in August for the first time ever, according to new government statistics . That's more than either Russia or Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut Exxon ( XOM ) was late to the shale revolution. Instead of drilling in North Dakota and Texas, Exxon plowed resources into expensive projects overseas, including ones in Russia that didn't pan out.\n\n\"They missed the boat on the shale boom. They're playing catch-up,\" said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones.\n\nThat deal, along with other US shale investments, are starting to pay off. Exxon's production in the Permian Basin and Bakken of North Dakota soared 30% in the second quarter. And Exxon signaled plans to pump more out of the Permian, which has turned into one of the largest oilfields in the world.\n\nInvestors are hoping Exxon was able to ramp up production to capitalize on higher oil prices. Even though crude has pulled back in recent weeks, prices last quarter were significantly higher than a year ago.\n\nHigher oil prices allowed Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSA ) to log a 50% jump in profit on Thursday.

The company needs to get back going to increase confidence from investors,\" said Youngberg.\n\nOthers don't think Exxon's recent production declines are a big deal in the long run.\n\n\"People in the oil industry know Exxon is the best in the business,\" said Jerry Bailey, a former Exxon executive who is currently president of oil producer Petroteq Energy.\n\n\"They're run by a bunch of guys in the business, not guys in pinstripes on Wall Street,\" said Bailey, who owns Exxon shares.\n\nExxon was held back in the second quarter by technical issues, including unscheduled maintenance that sidelined operations. The hiccups were a surprise because Exxon has a history of being a top-notch operator.\n\nIn the long run, Exxon has several overseas projects that look poised to eventually grow the company's bottom line. Exxon is most excited by its development in Guyana , which the company estimates contains 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil.\n\nBut turning Guyana into a moneymaker will take considerable time and resources -- something investors may not have patience for.\n\n\"They're taking the long-term approach,\" said Youngberg. \"I think it will pay dividends, but we won't be seeing it for another three years.\"", "(CNN) Early voting is a tricky indicator for predicting elections, since it's hard to know whether voters who cast ballots early would have voted anyway on Election Day but are simply doing it sooner -- or if they represent new voters altogether.\n\nBut one thing is clear: the share of younger people voting early in Texas and Georgia is far outpacing anything seen at this point during the last midterm election, in 2014. The trend holds for both those voters aged 18-30 and those 30-50.\n\nAnd while the share of younger voters has gone up so far, the percentage of seniors over 65 voting early, even though they are still the largest single bloc of early voters in either state, their overall share has fallen sharply. The group between the ages of 50 and 64 stayed virtually the same.\n\nBoth states are the scene of closely watched races: in the Texas US Senate race, Rep. Beto O'Rourke is trying to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, while in Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp are vying to become the state's next governor in a contest that's largely mirrored the national political climate.\n\nIf these early voting numbers actually do turn out to be a harbinger of increased turnout among younger voters, that could be great news for Democrats. According to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll released earlier this week, voters under 30 are much more likely to say they'll vote now than they were in 2014, and they are a deeply Democratic-leaning group.\n\nRead More", "bad url", "Yoram Hazony, president of the Herzl Institute in Jerusalem, is the author of a new book, \" The Virtue of Nationalism .\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) At a campaign rally in Texas in October, President Donald Trump told the American public that they would have to make a choice between globalism and nationalism.\n\n\"A globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much,\" he said. In opposition to globalism, Trump added, \"They have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It's called a nationalist. ... You know what I am? I'm a nationalist.\"\n\nCommentators in the media have castigated Trump for this, declaring that the term \"nationalist\" is loaded with \" racial undertones ,\" a dog-whistle to racism that is a \" favorite of the alt-right ,\" and must necessarily stir up division and feelings of superiority for one group over others.\n\nBut these attacks on Trump's words are misguided. In fact, Trump got this issue exactly right.\n\nGlobalism vs. nationalism is the great political struggle of our age, realigning the politics of nations not only in America, but in the UK, Italy, Eastern Europe and across the democratic world. In the end, every one of us will have to understand what's at stake and take a side.\n\nHistorically, the word \"nationalism\" has been used to describe a view of the world as governed best when nations are allowed to chart their own independent course. This is opposed to \" imperialism ,\" which looks to bring peace and prosperity to the world by uniting mankind, as much as possible, under a single political regime.\n\nFew ideas are more maligned today than nationalism, but it wasn't always this way. Until only a few decades ago, a nationalist politics was associated with broad-mindedness and a generous spirit: Progressives regarded Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points and Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill's Atlantic Charter as beacons of hope for mankind, precisely because they were nationalist documents, promising national independence and self-determination to enslaved peoples.\n\nJUST WATCHED Panel heats up over definition of 'nationalism' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Panel heats up over definition of 'nationalism' 02:49\n\nTeddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower saw nationalism as a positive ordering principle in world affairs, and Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were welcomed by conservatives for infusing political life with a new spirit of nationalism. France's Charles de Gaulle, India's Mahatma Gandhi, and Israel's David Ben-Gurion all led nationalist movements that won widespread admiration as they steered their people to freedom.\n\nThe nationalist standpoint has a distinguished history. The vision of a world of independent nations i s central to the Bible, which opposed the imperialism that was the official ideology of the Pharaohs, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians \u2014 and later adopted by the Romans, the Catholic Holy Roman Empire, and the Muslim caliphate. The modern world was born with the Protestant embrace of the principle of national self-determination, culminating in Henry VIII's renunciation of subservience to the Holy Roman Empire in 1534. The English model of national independence was subsequently adopted by the Netherlands, Scotland, France, and eventually America.\n\nFor more than four centuries, peoples of Western Europe and America lived under a new construction of the political world \u2014 one in which national independence and self-determination came to be regarded as the key to a free world. This new order of competing independent nations imparted unique dynamism to Europe, releasing a storm of dormant energies and fostering a stunning degree of experiment and innovation in government and economics, science and religion. In short, the national-state system created the world we live in.\n\nAs late as the Second World War, many still believed that national freedom was the key to a just, diverse, and relatively peaceful world. But Hitler changed all that. Immediately after the war, George Orwell began to use the term \"nationalism\" as a synonym for political fanaticism, and scholars such as Elie Kedourie began to develop the argument that the political theory of nationalism had been decisive in bringing about the two world wars. By the 1960s, these views had been adopted by many of the leading political and intellectual figures in Europe, who came to see nationalism as something to be despised and suppressed.\n\nThis European hostility, both to the term \"nationalism\" and to the theory of national independence it represents, reached the United States by way of academia, giving rise to the stigma that is so often attached to this idea, especially among university-educated Americans. In place of nationalism, many have embraced what is today called \"globalism\" (or \"transnationalism\"), which is just another name for the aspiration toward a worldwide liberal empire in which individual rights and free markets would be imposed, where necessary, on recalcitrant nations by an international regime run by Americans and Europeans.\n\nBut this case for universal liberal empire is based on a false reading of history. Hitler was no nationalist in the conventional sense of this term: He despised the dream of a world of independent nations, and in Mein Kampf he vowed to destroy the national states of Europe so Germany could become \" mistress of the globe \" and \" lord of the earth .\" Nazism was an imperialist enterprise from its inception.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lemon: No shame in the Trump WH for the lies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lemon: No shame in the Trump WH for the lies 08:38\n\nBlaming World War I on nationalism alone is far-fetched too. The Serb nationalists' local struggle with the Austrian Empire and their assassination of the Austrian heir to the throne, which provided the pretext for the war, could not by themselves have fueled a world war. What did it was the German Empire's bid to break the back of British and French imperialism before these empires could establish permanent control over the globe.\n\nLearning the lessons of the 20th century isn't easy, and with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Soviet Communism in 1989, Americans and Europeans should have turned to a rigorous debate over whether to replace the centuries-old order of independent nations with a universal liberal empire. But the debate never took place: After Margaret Thatcher was deposed in 1990 by her own party for raising doubts about the European Union, virtually no one in a position of influence was much inclined to take up the fight.\n\nUtopianism was the order of the day, and with uncanny unanimity, Western leaders moved ahead with two great imperialist projects that were supposed to bring peace and prosperity to the earth: An \" ever closer union \" of the nations of Europe in which they would forfeit much of their former independence; and an American-sponsored \" rules-based international order ,\" under which nations that do not abide by the decisions of international bodies would be coerced into doing so, principally by US armed force -- a globalist policy that we got to see carried out in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and Somalia.\n\nBut this transition to \"globalist\" politics was made without making sure everyone was on board. Britain's 2016 Brexit vote for independence from the European Union, followed by Trump's presidential win in the US and nationalist electoral victories in Italy and Eastern Europe, reflect widespread alienation from the imperialism of the emerging liberal world order.\n\nCould it be that the nationalists are right? One advantage of their approach is that it sees human nature clearly: Human beings are fiercely loyal to families, tribes, and nations, much of the time acting to advance the interests, internal cohesion, and unique cultural inheritance of the collectives to which they belong. In a political order consisting of independent nations, these mutual loyalties are channeled for the betterment of mankind: Competition among independent nations has led to unprecedented innovation and flourishing.\n\nMoreover, though national states fight over borders, they tend to prefer not to squander resources on conquering distant nations and imposing their way of life on others. Because the national-state inculcates the principle of national freedom, it also tends toward a greater tolerance of diversity among the nations that is largely absent from imperialist ideologies. This focus on strengthening the nation at home makes most nationalist movements preferable to imperialist ideologies (whether Christian, Muslim, Marxist, or liberal), with their thirst for engaging in universal wars.\n\nFor more opinion...

Where strong bonds of national loyalty exist, it becomes possible for a ruler to trust his people enough to grant them freedoms that limit his power -- and for rival tribes to give up on violence and accept a peaceful electoral politics. No imperial state ruling over distant nations is characterized by such mutual loyalties, and for this reason, no empire can be governed by means of free institutions.\n\nNationalists hope for the abandonment of the globalist project, and a revitalization of the centuries-old order of independent nations. Averse to squandering resources on conquering distant nations and trying to impose liberalism on them, they prefer to build up a world that tolerates diverse ways of life. And on this point, the nationalists are right.", "(CNN) With just five days left before the 2018 midterms, homepages and TV screens are filled with fancy graphics that project how the battle for the majority in the House and Senate might turn out. Discussions of what split control of Congress could mean for President Donald Trump's second term are legion.\n\nWhat you see FAR less of in the coverage is conversations about the 35(!) governor races on the ballot -- and the gains that Democrats are positioned to make in large population states, gains with huge reverberations not just in the 2020 presidential race but also in the decennial nationwide redistricting process that will begin in earnest after the 2020 Census is competed.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\"No Democrat needs to be reminded why statewide elections in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin matter in presidential campaigns. But until now, the (Democratic National Committee) has seemed intent on letting everyone ignore the GOP's biggest vulnerability, namely the fact that those three states\u2014not to mention swing states like Florida, Ohio, Iowa, and Minnesota\u2014are electing governors next week. If Democrats end up flipping state houses in places Trump won in 2016, they will have proved themselves capable of winning in the places coastal elites derisively refer to as 'flyover America.' You can't overstate how big a deal that will be.\"\n\nLook. It's easy to see why the focus for most politically minded people is the House and Senate. We like the idea of a battle for control. We like the maps that show how close one side or the other is to getting that final seat it needs. And because so much of the political media is based in Washington, we know these people running for House and Senate. We see them. They are, in Washington, big deals.\n\nBut, but, but ...\n\nThe simple fact is that with VERY few exceptions, a single governor has far more power on a day-in, day-out basis than the average senator. (Obviously that isn't true if we are talking about members of the Senate leadership like Mitch McConnell or Chuck Schumer.) And if you look back at recent presidential history -- Barack Obama excepted -- the sort of politicians that people like to nominate to run for president tend to be chief executives of their own states, not House members or senators.\n\nWhich is why the case can be made that -- when you are talking about the long-term health of the Democratic Party, for example -- what is happening at the gubernatorial level matters even more than the increasing likelihood that Democrats will retake the House majority in five days. (Nota bene: Notice I said the long-term health of the Democratic Party. In the near-term, controlling one of the two chambers of Congress will help Democrats slow Trump's agenda to a crawl.)\n\nConsider this: Of the 10 largest states by population, nine of them will hold gubernatorial elections on November 6. (North Carolina won't -- and has a Democratic governor.) At the moment, six of those nine are controlled by Republicans, but there is a scenario in which eight of the nine could be held by Democrats on November 7.\n\nHere's who is in power now:\n\n1. California (D)\n\n2. Texas (R)\n\n3. Florida (R)\n\n4. New York (D)\n\n5. Pennsylvania (D)\n\n6. Illinois (R)\n\n7. Ohio (R)\n\n8. Georgia (R)\n\n9. North Carolina (D) -- not voting in 2018\n\n10. Michigan (R)\n\nWith the exception of California, Pennsylvania, Texas and New York -- where the party that currently hold the governorship is virtually assured of keeping control -- and North Carolina ,which doesn't vote until 2020 for governor, there are five extremely competitive races in five very big and very important states -- all of which currently have Republican governors.\n\nOf those five, Democrats have a very clear advantage in Illinois, and a smaller but still statistically significant one in Michigan. The other three -- Florida, Georgia and Ohio -- could well determine just how good this election will be for Democrats. Win all three, and it is a night like Republicans had in 2010. Win two of the three and it's a night like Republicans had in 2014. Win none of the three and it's a night like Democrats had in 2010 and 2014.\n\nAnd remember this: All of the governors elected on Tuesday in these states will be in office through 2022, which means they will be their states' chief executives during the once-in-a-decade redrawing of legislative and congressional district lines following the 2020 census.\n\nIf you need a reminder of why that matters, simply go back and read up on the 2010 election -- and its aftermath. The massive gains Republicans made at the state level -- governors and state legislatures -- put the party firmly in control of the redistricting process in a slew of critical states, including many on my list above. That total control allowed GOP strategists and politicians to construct maps that made it very, very difficult for Democrats to retake the House -- although, after eight years in the political wilderness, it now appears as though House Democrats will grab the brass ring.\n\nAt the moment, Republicans control the state legislature and the governor's office in Florida, Georgia, Michigan and Ohio. Democrats control the Illinois Legislature, but the state has a Republican governor. In each one of those five states, the legislature will be tasked with redrawing the congressional (and legislative) lines in 2021. In each of those states, the governor has veto power over the maps the legislature produces. So it matters a whole hell of a lot which party controls the governor's mansion.\n\nWant to raise the stakes even more? Early projections suggest that Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania are each expected to lose at least one congressional district -- to slower than average population growth -- after the 2020 Census. And that Florida, North Carolina and Texas are all slated to gain seats in that same process because they grew faster than the national average. Getting to draw those new lines -- or at least having veto power over who draws those lines -- matters HUGELY.\n\nSo on election night when you are glued to your TV trying to see if Democrats can win the House or if Republicans can hang on to the Senate, make sure you spare a little time to see who is getting elected in governor races across the country. Those people may matter more to the future of our party politics than anyone in Washington.", "Story highlights Selena is among 34 entertainers who got stars this year\n\nEva Longoria: The honor is for \"all Latinas\"\n\n(CNN) The legacy of singer Selena Quintanilla has lived on for more than two decades. Now the \"Queen of Tejano music\" has joined a constellation of stars in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe singer simply known as Selena was honored Friday with a posthumous star in one of showbiz's most visible landmarks.\n\n\"While she was taken from us way too early, we now have something permanent that generation after generation can see in the most famous neighborhood anywhere in the world,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said.\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer was shot dead 22 years ago by the president of her fan club.\n\nAt the time, she was breaking concert attendance records and her albums were at the top of the music charts. She was known for hits that include \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" \"Dreaming of You\" and \"Como la Flor.\"", "(CNN) When Selena was breaking concert attendance records at home and abroad, there weren't a lot of crossover pop stars who looked like her in the United States.\n\nThere was Rita Moreno and Gloria Estefan and ... well, that's about it.\n\nThe March 31, 1995, death of the Mexican-American singer plunged many Latino listeners into mourning and brought her music to the attention of English speakers who would soon become fans.\n\nSelena Quintanilla-Perez started singing the Tejano music that eventually made her famous in her father's restaurant in Lake Jackson, Texas. Her father Abraham taught the family band and named them Los Dinos after his own group from earlier years. Selena's brother, A.B., played bass, and her sister, Suzette, played drums.\n\nWhen the family moved to Corpus Christi, the group started getting gigs at local parties and weddings.\n\nSelena was only 15 when she won female entertainer of the year at the Tejano Music Awards. That got her a record contract, and several albums followed. She eventually married her guitarist, Chris Perez.\n\nIn 1994, she won a Grammy for best Mexican-American album for \"Selena Live!\" and seemed poised for mainstream stardom.\n\nWhen the president of Selena's fan club shot her to death the following year in a Texas motel room, her first English-language album was months from release. Her death made international headlines.\n\nShe was 23 years old.\n\nHere are five things you may not know about Selena.\n\nSelena had to learn Spanish.\n\nA third-generation Texan of Mexican descent, Selena didn't grow up speaking Spanish. Neither did her husband, Perez, who played guitar in her band and fell in love with her on the road.\n\nIn his book, \"To Selena, with Love,\" Perez said they practiced speaking Spanish before their first big publicity blitz in Mexico. \"In Mexico, Selena mangled her conversations in Spanish like the rest of us, but not for long.\"\n\n\"She said, 'It'll be cool. You watch. I'm going to learn Spanish and surprise everybody,' \" Perez wrote. \"She got better and better, to the point where I'd have to ask her to slow down so that I could understand what she was saying.\"\n\nShe sold out the Astrodome.\n\nSelena performed several times at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo at the Astrodome to sold-out crowds of more than 60,000 people. (It wasn't just any rodeo: Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the Osmonds have all played the event.)\n\n\"We had 20 performances this year,\" Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show, told the New York Times in 1995 . \"We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome.\"\n\nHer album went to No. 1.\n\nHer 1995 crossover album, \"Dreaming of You,\" went to the top of the Billboard 200 the first week it was released. She was the first Latin artist to debut atop the list.\n\n\"There were supposed to be 14 tracks, but we had only recorded four of them, so we put together a tribute album of new and old songs,\" Nancy Brennan, then vice president of A&R at EMI, told Texas Monthly . \"Making that album was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do, because we were listening to her voice all day and crying as we were mixing the songs.\"\n\n\"Selena\" (the movie) ignited Jennifer Lopez's career.\n\nStarring as Selena in the 1997 movie of the same name, Jennifer Lopez became the first Latina actress to be paid $1 million for a movie role. Lopez was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance.\n\n\"Getting to play the part of Selena was life-changing for me,\" Lopez told Para Todos magazine . \"I got to immerse myself in her life, got to know her family, her home, her culture ... every part of her story. It was a special time in my life both professionally and personally. Playing her not only opened doors for me in the film world, but it inspired me to start my own music career. In a lot of ways, I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't had that experience.\"\n\nSelena's killer is eligible for parole in 2025.\n\nYolanda Saldivar, the president of Selena's fan club, was sentenced to life in prison in October 1995 for Selena's murder.

Her memoir, \" When They Call You a Terrorist ,\" was a New York Times best-seller. The views expressed here are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) As soon as #BlackLivesMatter began trending on social media in 2013, the death threats against me began. Since then, not a week has gone by where I don't receive some threat against my life online.\n\nSo when pipe bombs were discovered across the country, and Cesar Sayoc was arrested in Florida after two harrowing days, I was not surprised the suspect fit into the mold of my worst online harassers: a white supremacist Donald Trump supporter targeting people he considered critics of his leader's agenda.\n\nThen, as if that weren't enough, we learned of horrifying killings at a Kroger in Kentucky and a synagogue in Pennsylvania . As people began investigating the backgrounds of the three suspects in these hate-fueled crimes, many in the media and elsewhere finally realized something organizers have known for years. Online harassment is a predictor for this kind of racialized violence.\n\nFor so many black and other marginalized users, tech platforms have long been hostile and toxic environments, but enough is enough. Tech companies must do much more to protect underrepresented communities and combat online hate, and they must start now. It shouldn't take tragedies to get tech companies to address hate speech and online harassment proactively.\n\nThat's why racial justice, civil rights, anti-hate and open internet organizations have come together to call on tech companies to reduce hate on their platforms. This new project, \" Change the Terms, Reducing Hate in Tech ,\" gives tech companies clear steps to help marginalized voices engage more freely on their platforms without fear of hateful harassment or erroneous censorship by biased algorithms and improperly trained moderators.\n\nIt won't be easy to reduce hate and extremism online, but there are steps every tech company can take to address this issue more effectively.\n\nFirst, tech companies need new training materials for content moderators, created by anti-hate experts with relevant social, cultural and historical understanding of power dynamics. Users should also have the right to appeal any removed content or accounts.\n\nTech companies also need to make their content moderation training materials publicly available so anti-hate advocates and the public can make sure the trainings accurately reflect what we need to feel safe on these platforms. Recent leaks of moderation materials have shown these documents to be woefully inadequate -- one leak of a Facebook manual featured passages lifted straight from Wikipedia. When asked for comment by one media outlet, Facebook directed it to the \" community standards \" document the company released to the public. A $500 billion company such as Facebook should have higher standards than a college freshman rushing to finish a term paper.\n\nTech companies also need to be totally transparent around what type of content is being removed and what isn't. With greater transparency around content moderation, platforms will help ensure that marginalized voices are being protected, while those that seek to harm, harass and intimidate are quickly removed.\n\nThese actions are desperately needed and long overdue. As we reel from the violence of the last weeks, white supremacists and other hate groups continue to use online platforms to organize, fund, normalize and recruit supporters for racism, sexism, xenophobia, religious bigotry, homophobia and transphobia. Their largely unchecked behavior online chills speech from marginalized voices, curbs democratic participation and leads to real-world violence such as the kind we've all now seen.\n\nFor more opinion...

By enacting stronger policies and the robust transparency measures, tech companies will not only more effectively reduce hate online, they will also begin to restore public trust in their ability to handle these problems.\n\nI know firsthand what it meant to be called a terrorist after I spoke out against police violence. It meant that I became a target. Tech companies have the means and the responsibility to change this; they just need to follow the blueprint laid out in \"Change the Terms, Reducing Hate in Tech.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEsta final, ser\u00e1 la \u00faltima de ida y vuelta que tenga el certamen ya que a partir de 2019 se jugar\u00e1 a un solo partido y en campo neutral\n\nLa final entre el Boca Juniors y el River Plate es considerada la final m\u00e1s dram\u00e1tica y esperada por los fan\u00e1ticos de ambos equipos\n\nEl partido de ida se jugar\u00e1 el s\u00e1bado 10 de noviembre a las 4:00 p.m. (Argentina) en La Bombonera, y el partido de vuelta ser\u00e1 el s\u00e1bado 24 de noviembre, a la misma hora\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Esta noche a las 7:00 p.m. (Miami) en CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, el periodista Jonatan Viale presenta una entrevista al presidente del Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate, Rodolfo D\u2019Onofrio a unos d\u00edas del cl\u00e1sico entre Boca Juniors y River Plate.\n\nEntre otras cosas, D\u2019Onofrio hablar\u00e1 sobre la situaci\u00f3n actual de River Plate ante la Conmebol, luego de la pol\u00e9mica semifinal que jug\u00f3 frente al equipo brasilero Gremio, y la contravenci\u00f3n que llevo a cabo el DT del equipo, Marcelo Gallardo.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, el mandatario de River conversar\u00e1 en vistas a la final de la Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica, frente a su principal opositor, Boca Juniors.

The conclusion comes from a final report on research evaluating the effect of radio frequency radiation, which is used in cell phones. \"There was also some evidence of tumors in the brain and adrenal gland of exposed male rats. For female rats, and male and female mice, the evidence was equivocal as to whether cancers observed were associated with exposure to RFR.\"\n\nWhat is surprising, however, is that another federal health agency, the US Food and Drug Administration, disagrees with the conclusion.\n\n\"After reviewing the study, we disagree, however, with the conclusions of their final report regarding 'clear evidence' of carcinogenic activity in rodents exposed to radiofrequency energy,\" Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement Thursday in response to the report.\n\nOne thing the two agencies, which both fall under the US Department of Health and Human Services, agree on is that the findings of these studies in rats and mice should not apply to human cell phone use.\n\n\"The exposures used in the studies cannot be compared directly to the exposure that humans experience when using a cell phone,\" John Bucher, a senior scientist with the National Toxicology Program, said in a statement. \"In our studies, rats and mice received radiofrequency radiation across their whole bodies. By contrast, people are mostly exposed in specific local tissues close to where they hold the phone. In addition, the exposure levels and durations in our studies were greater than what people experience.\"\n\nThe final report and the consensus from the National Toxicology Program are the conclusion of a 10-year, $30 million research effort.\n\nThe research included two large animal studies -- one in rats and one in mice -- that link high levels of cell phone radiation to some evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats, including a rare type of tumor called a schwannoma in their hearts. There were no such significant findings in the female rats.\n\nSimilarly, no significant findings emerged in the mouse study, according to the reports.\n\n\"One of the things that we found most interesting about our findings was that the malignant schwannomas -- even though they occurred in the heart and not in the head of these animals -- were in fact schwannomas,\" Bucher said in February when the draft report was released.\n\nThe FDA notes that cell phones emit low levels of radiofrequency energy that are non-ionizing and thus not considered strong enough to permanently damage biological tissue including DNA.\n\nNIH also noted that the studies did not evaluate the current 5G networks that are used or Wi-Fi. \"5G is an emerging technology that hasn't really been defined yet. From what we currently understand, it likely differs dramatically from what we studied,\" said Michael Wyde, a lead toxicologist on the studies.\n\nConfusion and controversy\n\nThe National Toxicology Program studies involved about 3,000 rodents, as was detailed in the February draft report.\n\nThe animals were exposed to radio-frequency radiation levels equal to and higher than the highest level currently allowed for mobile phone emissions. The researchers tracked the health of the animals from in utero to 2 years of age.\n\nA 2-year-old rat would be somewhat comparable to a 70-year-old human, Bucher said.\n\nThe researchers divided the rodents into two groups based on radiofrequency radiation levels, low or high, and exposed their entire bodies to radiofrequency radiation for 10-minute increments totaling to about nine hours a day over the two-year period.\n\n\"It's important to consider the magnitude of the exposures to the animals in these studies in relation to what one might typically receive from using a cell phone,\" Bucher said. \"The lowest energy level of the radiofrequency radiation we studied was similar to the highest level currently permitted for cell phone emissions.\"\n\nAmong the male rats, the researchers found tumors in about 6% of those in the highest radiation exposure group, Bucher said. That percentage \"exceeded the mean historical incidence (0.8%), and exceed the highest rate observed in a single historical control group (2%) of completed peer reviewed studies,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nJUST WATCHED Welcome to the National Quiet Zone Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Welcome to the National Quiet Zone 09:49\n\nThe researchers also found that the male rats in the high-exposure group appeared to live longer than the other rats, but more research is needed to determine why and how that may be relevant to the study results.\n\n\"Animal studies like this one contribute to our discussions on this topic, but we must remember the study was not designed to test the safety of cell phone use in humans, so we cannot draw conclusions about the risks of cell phone use from it,\" Shuren said.\n\n\"Based on our ongoing evaluation of this issue, the totality of the available scientific evidence continues to not support adverse health effects in humans caused by exposures at or under the current radiofrequency energy exposure limits. We believe the existing safety limits for cell phones remain acceptable for protecting the public health.\"\n\n'Exercise caution'\n\n\"The safety of consumers is the wireless industry's first priority,\" CTIA, the trade association representing the US wireless communications industry, said in a statement Thursday. \"We follow the guidance of experts when it comes to cellphones and health effects. The scientific community will consider today's report in the context of the many scientific studies conducted over several decades.\n\n\"We note NTP's own assessment that today's report cannot be extrapolated to human cell phone usage, and the Food and Drug Administration's concurrence that 'these findings should not be applied to human cell phone usage' and that 'the existing safety limits for cell phones remain acceptable for protecting the public health.' These conclusions are consistent with official federal brain tumor statistics showing that since the introduction of cellphones in the mid-1980s, the rate of brain tumors in the United States has decreased.\"\n\nCNN's parent company, WarnerMedia, is owned by communications company AT&T.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization, said in a statement Thursday that \"the findings reinforce the need for people, especially children, to exercise caution when using cellphones and other radiation-emitting devices.\"\n\nOlga Naidenko, a senior scientist for chlidren's environmental health at the group, said, \"This report should raise alarms for policymakers and awareness for all Americans. These studies should have been done before more than 90 percent of Americans, including millions of children, started using this technology day in and day out.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nJoel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at the University of California Berkeley's School of Public Health, said in an email that the new report affirms the concerns of the scientific community about \"harm caused by chronic exposure to low-intensity electromagnetic fields.\"\n\nBucher was clear: \"We believe that the link between radiofrequency radiation and tumors in male rats is real, and the external experts agreed.\"\n\nShuren said the FDA will continue to evaluate scientific evidence that looks at the potential health effects of radiofrequency radiation on animals and humans.\n\nSo what's a cell phone user to do? There are some steps people can take to limit exposure to radiofrequency radiation. These include holding phones away from your body and using earbuds or other means to communicate without holding the phone against your body.\n\n\"I have not changed the way I use a cell phone,\" Bucher said.", "(CNN) Ending the concept of birthright citizenship isn't something Donald Trump just dreamed up yesterday: He's actually been talking about it for years, including just after his 2015 campaign announcement.\n\nIn 1791, as the newly established United States sought approval of the U.S. Constitution by thirteen states, some states requested that specific rights for each individual citizen should be added before it was ratified. 10 new amendments, known as The Bill of Rights, were added to the Constitution to preserve, first and foremost, the \"rights of the individual to freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly and petition\". The Bill also protected citizens from a violation of these rights under the law and in the court system and confirmed an individual's right to bear arms.\n\nBack then, he complained that a Constitutional amendment to end the practice of granting citizenship to anyone born in the US would take too long. What he was saying to CNN's Chris Cuomo more than three years ago as a new candidate isn't completely different than what he's said in recent days.\n\nHere's that exchange from August 19, 2015:\n\nTRUMP: Number one, the 14th Amendment is very questionable as to whether or not somebody can come over and have a baby and immediately that baby is a citizen.\n\nCUOMO: I know. The court has pretty much said and agreed that immigrants here, this isn't a minority legal opinion you are talking about.\n\nTRUMP: Chris, there are many people that totally feel that...\n\nCUOMO: They may have want it that way.\n\nTRUMP: ... amending is too big of deal it's going to be take -- it will be two terms, I'd be in my second term on my eighth year by the time assuming everything went smoothly because to amend the Constitution..... I believe you can win it legally OK? I believe you can win it legally. And in any event the parents have to leave, if the parents leave, unless they are very bad people, they got to take their baby.\n\nNow Trump is pushing the idea again as a way to fire up his base supporters in the waning days of an election where his party is expected to suffer losses that could cost them control of the House of Representatives.\n\nWhether he will actually follow through and sign some sort of executive action telling the government to essentially ignore the 14th Amendment after the heat of the election season is over remains to be seen.\n\nBut Trump is certainly right that amending the Constitution takes time. It's so hard, in fact, that it's only been done 17 times since the initial Bill of Rights was enacted. That's a total of 27 amendments in more than 200 years, the last of which was officially codified in the 1992 after a decades-long effort. And that was for the politically benign purpose of not letting federal lawmakers raise their own salaries until after the next election. Something politically charged like upending an amendment passed to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves would be something else entirely.\n\nIt's not unprecedented to pass an amendment undoing a previous amendment. The 21st Amendment undid the 18th Amendment and ended prohibition, for instance.\n\nAnd just because it's hard to amend the Constitution doesn't mean there aren't a lot of ideas floating around for how it could be done. Search \"Constitutional amendment\" in Congress's database of actively introduced legislation for the current Congress and 142 official proposals pop up.\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\nBalance the budget -- Despite the fact that the tax bill Republicans recently passed will explode the federal budget deficit in coming years, there are a large number of Republicans (and a few Democrats) who push a Balanced Budget Amendment every few years. When the proposal has come to a vote, it's failed, -- Despite the fact that the tax bill Republicans recently passed will explode the federal budget deficit in coming years, there are a large number of Republicans (and a few Democrats) who push a Balanced Budget Amendment every few years. When the proposal has come to a vote, it's failed, as it did in April of this year , and as it has in years past . That won't stop it from being introduced against next year. And it won't stop the national debt from growing after decades of budget deficits. $21,600,000,000,000 and counting.\n\nEnd the Electoral College - If Democrats have their own dream of constitutional reform, it would probably start with ending the Electoral College, that relic of the late 18th century, which today gives more rural states a leg up in presidential elections. That's how two of the last three presidents (both Republicans) were elected despite receiving fewer actual votes than the Democrat. With Republicans in control of the House, the Senate, the White House and a majority of state legislatures, - If Democrats have their own dream of constitutional reform, it would probably start with ending the Electoral College, that relic of the late 18th century, which today gives more rural states a leg up in presidential elections. That's how two of the last three presidents (both Republicans) were elected despite receiving fewer actual votes than the Democrat. With Republicans in control of the House, the Senate, the White House and a majority of state legislatures, that one is going nowhere fast\n\nEnd the income tax - Republicans enacted tax reform and Trump wants to cut taxes even more, but Rep. Steve King this year also - Republicans enacted tax reform and Trump wants to cut taxes even more, but Rep. Steve King this year also introduced an amendment to undo the 16th Amendment and get rid of the income tax altogether. That would seem to run counter to the parallel idea of requiring a balanced budget each year, but neither one is gaining much traction.\n\nControl campaign spending - No Supreme Court decision of the last two decades rankles Democrats (and some Republicans) more than Citizens United, which gutted US campaign finance law under the guise of free speech. There are multiple proposals to amend the Constitution to fix it. This midterm election, by the way, - No Supreme Court decision of the last two decades rankles Democrats (and some Republicans) more than Citizens United, which gutted US campaign finance law under the guise of free speech. There are multiple proposals to amend the Constitution to fix it. This midterm election, by the way, will have $5 billion pumped into it\n\nEnshrine rights to vote and to health care - You don't actually have a - You don't actually have a right to vote in the US at the moment. Several amendments refer obliquely to a right to vote, but that right is not actually spelled out like the right to speech or to bear arms is. That makes it easy for lawmakers to abridge voters' rights whenever they have political support. Think of this as the counterattack to efforts to put obstacles in front of voters like requiring ID. There's a movement afoot, particularly after the Supreme Court gutted parts of the civil rights era Voting Rights Act, to enshrine a \"right to vote\" as an amendment.\n\n'Clarify' Trump's pardoning power - Trump has used the power to pardon unlike any other President, handing out clemency as a political favor and to make political points. He hasn't ruled out pardoning his former aides for possible crimes related to the 2016 campaign. Rep. Al Green has proposed an amendment that - Trump has used the power to pardon unlike any other President, handing out clemency as a political favor and to make political points. He hasn't ruled out pardoning his former aides for possible crimes related to the 2016 campaign. Rep. Al Green has proposed an amendment that would clarify Trump cannot pardon himself\n\nEqual rights for men and women - A proposed - A proposed Equal Rights Amendment has been in the works since 1923 and it is re-introduced each year in Congress. It has come closer than most of these proposals to reality. It passed both chambers of Congress in the 1970s, but it didn't get the required approval in 38 states to be added to the Constitution. Illinois' vote this year in favor of the amendment brings to 37 the number of states that have signed on, just one shy of that 38 figure. Congress initially set a deadline to pass the amendment and that ran out in 1982, so when supporters find that 38th state, you can bet there will be a fight over whether every state legislature vote is still valid.\n\nParental rights -- This one, introduced by Republicans, would seek to give parents a constitutional right in the education of their child to choose alternatives to public education.\n\nTerm limits - The President has a two-term limit as laid out in the 22nd Amendment. There are quite a few lawmakers who run each year on putting term limits in place for themselves, particularly after a 1995 Supreme Court decision that nullified 23 state laws for term limits on their federal lawmakers. This amendment would - The President has a two-term limit as laid out in the 22nd Amendment. There are quite a few lawmakers who run each year on putting term limits in place for themselves, particularly after a 1995 Supreme Court decision that nullified 23 state laws for term limits on their federal lawmakers. This amendment would make congressional term limits for every state . This proposed amendment probably has the most bipartisan support -- both Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz support it!\n\nMake DC a state -- There are a lot of US citizens out there who don't have the same representation as everyone else. DC and Puerto Rico in particular, have populations commensurate with some states, but no voting member of Congress or senators. DC voters do have their votes counted in presidential elections in the form of three Electoral College votes, but Puerto Rico voters only get their presidential preference counted if they move to a state or DC. DC's delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, introduces the DC Statehood proposal whenever possible. It's not technically an amendment, but would require the -- There are a lot of US citizens out there who don't have the same representation as everyone else. DC and Puerto Rico in particular, have populations commensurate with some states, but no voting member of Congress or senators. DC voters do have their votes counted in presidential elections in the form of three Electoral College votes, but Puerto Rico voters only get their presidential preference counted if they move to a state or DC. DC's delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, introduces the DC Statehood proposal whenever possible. It's not technically an amendment, but would require the repealing of the 23rd Amendment , which gave DC electoral votes.\n\nBan flag burning -- The Supreme Court has upheld flag burning as free speech protected by the First Amendment. But Congress has routinely considered such a flag-burning amendment, which has -- The Supreme Court has upheld flag burning as free speech protected by the First Amendment. But Congress has routinely considered such a flag-burning amendment, which has passed the House at least four times in the 2000s , but failed in the Senate. It's notable that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican and staunch protector of the First Amendment, is opposed, so it would probably take a different Republican leader to get movement on this.\n\nReapportion Congress by citizens rather than population -- This is another -- This is another King proposal , which would presumably mean fewer lawmakers in places with fewer non-citizens living there. The sad original text of the Constitution counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of apportionment. That language was undone by the same 14th Amendment, which granted birthright citizenship.\n\nThere are plenty more of these. Check out the full list at Congress.gov . Similarly, there have been efforts, like the one endorsed by Sen. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush , to create a new Constitutional Convention to pass some of these all at once -- term limits, balanced budget and reforming the commerce clause to defang the power of the federal government in terms of regulation.\n\nBut amending the Constitution ain't easy: It takes years under the best circumstances, which is why nobody's been able to do it in 27 years.",

villages in the outskirts of Maiduguri, in Borno State, burning houses and shooting at people late Wednesday.\n\n\"We just buried 10 people. Most of them were burnt to death, Boko Haram burnt a lot of houses with people in them,\" said Alsheikh Mohammed, a local council official told CNN in Mallumuti, one of the affected villages.\n\nMustapha Umar, who lives in Kofa, where the attack began around 8 p.m. local time, said five of his family members died after the insurgents set his home on fire.\n\n''My mother, my father and three of my children were burning in the fire.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood next to the Omani leader, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, as the two strolled through the halls of the palace in the capital Muscat. Netanyahu is smiling as bin Said escorts him down the polished marbled floors.\n\nThe unannounced visit -- the first by an Israeli leader to Oman in more than 20 years -- is the clearest sign yet of the warming relations between Israel and the Arab states. Oman and Israel do not have diplomatic relations, but that didn't get in the way of the meeting.\n\nOne day after the meeting, Oman's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, said, according to Reuters: \"Israel is a state present in the region, and we all understand this. The world is also aware of this fact. Maybe it is time for Israel to be treated the same [as other states] and also bear the same obligations.\"\n\nBin Alawi, speaking at a summit in Bahrain attended by US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said Oman was willing to contribute ideas to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process while backing American efforts. Bahrain's foreign minister backed Oman's position.\n\nSpeaking to Cabinet colleagues after his return, Netanyahu said, \"This visit comes against the background of diplomatic efforts that I have been promoting in recent years vis-\u00e0-vis the Arab countries.

But like \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms\" is an expensive but clunky fantasy, mashing together mythical elements but mostly hitting discordant notes.\n\nLoosely based on the original 19th-century story and the Tchaikovsky ballet (including a cameo by ballerina Misty Copeland that, awkward as it is, winds up being a highlight), the film -- again, like \"Wrinkle\" -- centers on a teenage girl, Clara (Mackenzie Foy), who stumbles into a fantastic world that calls upon her to find the hero within.\n\nIn this case, Clara is growing up in London, still grieving from the loss of her mother and providing little solace to her father (Matthew Macfadyen), who is equally confused as to how to express himself to his three children.\n\n\"The real world just doesn't make sense to me anymore,\" she says, right before being liberated from it.\n\nOn Christmas eve, Clara's dad presents the kids with gifts that their mother left behind, including a mysterious box for Clara. After a meeting with the wild-haired inventor Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman, briefly), she's whisked off to the Four Realms, a slightly less frenetic version of Wonderland, where she's hailed as a princess, her mother having been its Queen.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

fight to keep sport clean, with a number of leading athletes seemingly pitted against the organization that's responsible for looking after anti-doping.\n\nOn Wednesday an emergency anti-doping summit in Washington called for reform of the World Anti-Doping Association (WADA) because \"athletes and sports fans across the globe\" had lost confidence in the organization in the wake of the Russian doping scandal. Two days earlier, leaders of 18 national anti-doping organizations had also called for WADA reform.\n\nThat's drawn a withering response from WADA president Sir Craig Reedie, who suggested the United States anti-doping agency (USADA) should address its own weaknesses.\n\n\"It is quite clearly an opportunity for lots of people to make statements in public they like doing,\" Reedie told CNN's Amanda Davies on Thursday.\n\n'Personal campaign'\n\nIn the face of condemnation from athletes and prominent officials, WADA lifted a three-year ban on Russia's anti-doping agency (RUSADA) in September despite it not having met all 31 of the necessary criteria.\n\nThe meeting in Washington was hosted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and USADA and was attended by athletes, sports bodies and representatives of governments from around the world.\n\nUSADA chief executive Travis T. Tygart, who was instrumental in bringing down Lance Armstrong, said Wednesday that WADA needed to \"wake up and smell the coffee.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Winter Olympics: WADA chief Reedie on Russia Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Winter Olympics: WADA chief Reedie on Russia 02:37\n\n\"Travis for years has been singing the same hymn, foxes guarding hen houses -- that is simply not true,\" said Reedie in response.\n\n\"He seems to have a personal campaign to be as difficult as he can be as far as Russia is concerned, maybe that's a personal feeling.\n\n\"At the moment, in this complex political situation we're in, the US is very keen to state its point of view when the rest of the world doesn't necessarily agree with it [so] maybe a combination of the two.\n\n\"But he's got his own challenges. All of the top sport in America, in the main, is not compliant,\" added Reedie, referring to sports such as the NFL.\n\n\"Why doesn't he go and speak to the players unions and maybe get them to try and agree that clean sport the world over would be better if some of the professional leagues became compliant with the world anti-doping code.\n\n\"It's difficult, I know. I've spoken to the NFL people myself ... it's not going to be easy but somebody should start trying to do it.\"\n\n'Closer to Russian anti-doping rehabilitation'\n\nReedie told reporters at a symposium in London that the decision to reinstate RUSADA was a \"democratic, transparent and accountable process\" and was the \"right one for clean sport.\"\n\n\"No one can deny that we are closer now to ensuring the rehabilitation of Russian anti-doping, and to providing a credible and sustainable program in that country,\" he said.\n\nReinstating RUSADA had not, said Reedie, changed the fact that Russia was still allowed to compete internationally, while banned Russian athletes remained banned from competition.\n\n\"The only difference it makes to have RUSADA compliant now is the strict conditions we have attached to it, namely Russia must provide us with access to the data from the Moscow laboratory so we can prosecute the cheats and we can exonerate those who did not cheat and who competed clean,\" he added.\n\nJUST WATCHED US skiers back Russia doping punishment Replay More Videos ...

It has bullied and disheartened athlete voices. This is the very organization that's supposed to protect us.\"\n\nBritish cyclist Callum Skinner, who was in attendance at the White House, said WADA had put \"autocracy over accountability and politics over principle.\"\n\nEmotional and powerful words from @AlysiaMontano.

We are intensely keen on enhanced athletic representation but we have to deal with all athletes.\n\n\"It's important now that the Callum Skinners of this world and the other athletes get together and decide how they would like to be represented and once they've done that then we will meet as many of these suggestions as we can.\"\n\nWashington summit\n\nThe reforms the White House summit called for included an inquiry into claims of bullying at the organization , an overhaul of the way in which WADA -- which receives half of its $34 million budget from national governments and half from the Olympics -- is governed and for the voice of athletes to be listened to.\n\nIn a statement, a list of the reforms that WADA needed to undertake were published:\n\nGovern and operate in respectful, accountable, democratic, and transparent manner.\n\nInclude athletes as full voting members on its Executive Committee and in other essential governance functions.\n\nA robust independent inquiry to examine WADA's culture, leadership and operations following the recent allegations of bullying and acts of intimidation at WADA.\n\nIndividuals with active roles in sport must not simultaneously serve in leadership positions at WADA.\n\nAn open and transparent process regarding securing all of the anti-doping samples and laboratory data in Russia, making a recommendation immediately after the December 31, 2018 deadline for compliance.\n\nWADA had issued a statement saying they were not invited to the meeting, but Tygart responded by saying the world anti-doping body had been invited.\n\n\"There is nothing remotely one-sided about having the world's athletes, national anti-doping leaders, government ministers and other clean sport champions at an emergency summit to drive reform of WADA,\" said Tygart in a statement published on Twitter Wednesday.\n\n\"WADA leadership, along with the IOC, are increasingly isolated with athletes and public opinion. They need to wake up and smell the coffee, step out from their ivory tower because athletes are demanding change and change is coming.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl dolor, la esclerosis m\u00faltiple y la epilepsia ser\u00edan \"candidatos obvios\" para el tratamiento con cannabis\n\nHubo un antes y un despu\u00e9s en esta historia: el nombramiento de un nuevo secretario de Estado en abril\n\n(CNN) - El gobierno de Gran Breta\u00f1a ha agregado el cannabis a la lista de medicamentos disponibles para los pacientes en su Servicio Nacional de Salud.\n\nA partir del 1 de noviembre, \"los m\u00e9dicos especializados pueden recetar cannabis medicinal a los pacientes\", inform\u00f3 el Ministerio del Interior en un comunicado.\n\nLos activistas presionaron al gobierno para reconsiderar su postura anterior de categorizar el cannabis como una sustancia de Clase A, definida como que no tiene valor medicinal o terap\u00e9utico.\n\nLEE: Coca-Cola podr\u00eda entrar al negocio de bebidas con infusi\u00f3n de cannabis\n\nLa opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica en el Reino Unido cambi\u00f3 con los casos altamente promocionados en los que a ni\u00f1os epil\u00e9pticos se les confiscaron medicamentos il\u00edcitos de cannabis.

Brown is a professor of law at Emory University. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) President Donald Trump is at it again, tweeting a thinly veiled racist attack ad designed to turn out his white base for the midterm elections. According to CNN exit polls 57% of white people voted for Trump in 2016. He needs them to come out and vote Tuesday to keep a Republican majority in Congress.\n\nDorothy A. Brown\n\nThe ad shows some frightening video of an undocumented immigrant from Mexico talking about killing police in the past and hopefully (he says, as he is led away by authorities) in the future. He smiles as he does this; his lawyer has said he is mentally ill.\n\nThe ad is designed to remind Trump voters of why they voted for him the first time. It is based on fear, not reality. The reality is those same white voters have more to fear from each other when it comes to crime than they do undocumented immigrants.\n\nRecent Department of Justice statistics show that when whites are the victims of violent crimes, in 57% of the cases , the perpetrator is white. In other words, those 57% of Trump supporters should be looking at each other with more suspicion than they do at other racial or ethnic groups -- including undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe research is clear . Undocumented and legal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born American citizens. The libertarian Cato Institute published a study based on Texas data that showed native-born citizens are more likely to be convicted of committing violent crimes, such as homicide, than either undocumented or legal immigrants.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Councilors in Stockholm say they intend to reject Apple's plans to build a store in a popular park in the Swedish capital.\n\nThe store, designed by British architecture firm Foster + Partners, had been planned for the Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden, or King's Garden.

of Russian meddling in 2016. But just days before the midterm elections, a key part of Facebook's effort is broken, and it's unclear if the company is doing anything to fix it.\n\nThe company has touted new rules for political ad-buyers as a major component of its work to combat disinformation on its platform. In 2016 Russian trolls with links to the Kremlin bought ads targeting Americans in the run-up to the presidential election. They were able to do so without giving any information to Americans seeing those ads about who was paying for them.\n\nPolitical ads on the platform are now supposed to say who paid for them, but Facebook allows buyers to fill in that information themselves. And if anyone or any system at the company is supposed to be ensuring that the information these ad-buyers submit is the truth, they appear to be asleep at the wheel.\n\nEarlier this week, Vice News , posing as a political ad-buyer, got approval from Facebook to run ads in the name of every single one of the US' 100 senators. Vice News did not end up buying the ads. This came after Vice News had previously received approval from Facebook to run ads \"Paid for\" by Islamic State and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nOn Thursday, ProPublica reported it had identified issues with how private interest groups use the Facebook disclaimer.\n\nSeparately, CNN Business found one advertiser breaking Facebook's rules twice in one week. Facebook missed both violations and only acted in both instances after CNN inquired about it.\n\nThe advertiser CNN Business found, an anti-Ted Cruz page called \"Crush Cruz,\" contained no information about who was behind it. Its ad disclaimers simply read, \"Paid for by Crush Cruz.\" The page had spent almost $6,000 on ads, meaning it could have reached hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Texas voters.\n\nLast Thursday after CNN Business asked about the page, Facebook said that Crush Cruz's disclaimer did not accurately represent a person or entity and stopped it from running ads.\n\nThe next day, the page was running ads again. This time, its disclaimer read, \"Paid for by Crush Cruz. Not authorized or paid for by any PAC, candidate, or candidate's committee.\"\n\nFacebook allowed the page to run 14 ads with the new disclaimer between Friday and Tuesday, when CNN Business contacted the company about the page again.\n\nOnce again, Facebook stopped the page's ads \u2014 saying the new disclaimer also broke its policies.\n\nBut why did Facebook not more carefully review a disclaimer submitted by a page that had already broken its rules? How did it not notice that it was going to approve ads falsely claiming to be run by Pence, 100 senators and the Islamic State.\n\nIt's not saying.\n\nCNN Business asked the company if a human reviewed Crush Cruz's new disclaimer before the page was allowed to begin running ads again, and if it were Facebook's policy to have a human review disclaimers for a page it had previously determined was in violation of its rules.\n\nThe company would only say its reviews are a combination of automation and human, and would provide no further details on any process it has for humans to vet the disclaimers.\n\nRob Leathern, director, product management at Facebook, told CNN Business in a statement, \"We believe that ad transparency is key to helping prevent election interference. Inaccurate 'paid for by' labels violate our policies. On top of our existing proactive checks, when alerted to deceptive labels, we investigate and remove them.\"\n\nLeathern said that the company's new publicly-available ad archive allows news organizations to hold bad actors and Facebook itself accountable.\n\nHe said, \"It's a way we're also held accountable-- even if it means our mistakes are on display. We're exploring additional checks to help prevent abuse and will respond to requests from law enforcement and election officials now and in the future if new requirements arise.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa propuesta es que si una persona comete un acto racista en un vuelo, sea entregada a las autoridades y apartada mientras dura el vuelo\n\nLos activistas colombianos buscan enviarle la silla simb\u00f3lica a David Mesher, un hombre blanco que insult\u00f3 a una mujer negra en un vuelo de Rynair\n\nUna campa\u00f1a que se llama 'Racist Class' busca establecer un protocolo de seguridad para cuando haya actos de racismo en los aviones o aeropuertos\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El incidente racista que ocurri\u00f3 a mediados de octubre en un avi\u00f3n de la aerol\u00ednea Ryanair, en el que un hombre blanco insult\u00f3 a una mujer negra que se iba a sentar a su lado, no ha terminado.

The movie itself is a paean to self-indulgence -- one he cowrote with his then-girlfriend, Oja Kodar, who also stars (if you can call it that, given the limited dialogue) playing a character in the movie within the movie.\n\nWelles insisted the plot wasn't autobiographical, a conclusion resisted -- as the documentary makes clear -- by everyone close to him. His good friend and fellow actor/director John Huston plays J.J. \"Jake\" Hannaford, an aging filmmaker desperately trying to finish his film -- one that's over schedule, and over budget -- while surrounded by toadies, hangers-on and studio types watching dailies that they're struggling to comprehend.\n\nIn terms of the burden of dreams (to borrow from another documentary about a filmmaker, Werner Herzog), the central character's plight has a good deal in common with Woody Allen's \"Stardust Memories,\" where the adulation of fans has mostly become an annoyance.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Amid a report that the case against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein may be unraveling , lawyers have added a woman to a class-action lawsuit who alleges the producer sexually assaulted her when she was 16.\n\nWeinstein allegedly then went on to harass the woman for the next nine years, promising her movie roles and other opportunities that never materialized after she rebuffed his advances, according to the suit, which was updated Wednesday.\n\nIdentified only as Jane Doe, a onetime model and aspiring actor, she joins a class of named women who say they suffered similar treatment during what they thought were professional meetings with Weinstein.\n\nThe women allege they were assaulted or that they refused his demands for sexual favors, and afterward, promises for roles or picture deals were never kept, says the lawsuit, which also targets heavy hitters in the entertainment industry who the suit alleges abetted Weinstein's behavior.\n\n\"This claim is preposterous,\" Weinstein attorney Ben Brafman said. \"Like so many other women in this case who have already been exposed as liars, this latest completely uncorroborated allegation that is almost 20 years old will also be shown to be patently false.\"\n\nBrafman has repeatedly denied the previous allegations against his client as well.\n\nThe introduction\n\nJane Doe was a Polish citizen who arrived in Manhattan \"with dreams of becoming an actress.\" She met Weinstein in September 2002 at a modeling event, her lawyer says.\n\nWeinstein \"lured her\" to his apartment in New York's Soho neighborhood three days later, the lawsuit says. The elevator opened into his apartment, and Weinstein quickly began demanding sex and threatening the girl, it says.\n\n\"He told her that if she want(ed) to be an actress, she would have to be comfortable doing whatever the director told her to do -- including losing her inhibitions and getting naked,\" the lawsuit says. \"He then instructed Jane Doe to take off her clothes.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Jessica Alba reflects on #MeToo movement and sexual harassment in Hollywood Replay More Videos ...

Dealt that bad hand, the \"Cards\" writers have responded with a truncated final season -- one that elevates Robin Wright's role her new Commander in Chief status, while still providing a window into the world of bare-knuckled political brawling.\n\nAn early gripe about the series was that Kevin Spacey's character, Frank Underwood, always seemed to be playing three-dimensional chess, while everyone else played checkers. Small wonder that his political opponents fell before him, as he broke the fourth wall to eagerly narrate their demise directly to the audience.\n\nSpacey, however, is gone, fired in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct. That heightens the focus on Underwood's wife, Claire (Wright), who brings a bit more subtlety to the process of governing but proves no less skillful at manipulating those around her.\n\nThat's fine, so far as it goes, but only if the foils provide enough resistance to enhance the underlying drama. The new season of \"Cards\" (five of the eight episodes were previewed) gives Claire ripped-from-the-headlines antagonists, in the form of Koch brothers-type billionaires -- only here, a brother-and-sister tandem, played by Greg Kinnear and Diane Lane. While the star power is impressive, the game they're playing -- too transparently -- feels somewhat less so.\n\nSeeking to account for Frank's absence doesn't exactly feel organic to the storytelling, but it does add some zest to the plot. At the very least, the storyline brings several dramatic possibilities into play, even if it's hard to escape the sense that these devices have been hoisted upon the writing staff, who surely wouldn't have written out Spacey in this way had events not dictated otherwise.\n\nRead More", "That's the President of the United States trying to explain his very casual relationship to truth to ABC News' White House reporter Jon Karl.

When established facts back up something Trump either innately believes to be true or something he wants to be true for political reasons, he is more than happy to tell the truth. But when the facts don't back up a Trump view or claim, he has zero compunction in creating his own \"truth\" that works better for his purposes.\n\nHere's his full answer to Karl, which gives you an even better sense of what Trump thinks about truth:\n\n\"Well, I try.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nOne month later and the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi continues to grip international headlines. But for all the Western commentary, this story has a lot less to do with press freedom than it does about power: who has it and how it can be used. The perpetrator (or perpetrators) made a critical mistake in assuming that having the power to reach across borders and permanently silence a well-known critic meant they were free to do so without fear of repercussions. It's a miscalculation that will haunt Saudi Arabia for years.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had staked much of his political legitimacy on transforming the Saudi Kingdom from sleepy petrostate into a modern and diversified economy as part of his ambitious Vision 2030. But to do that, Saudi Arabia had to fundamentally reform and become a country that companies and governments in the West wanted to partner with. After all, selling oil and buying arms would only get Riyadh so far. Hence the social reforms, like the decision to allow women to drive and pushing them to take a more active role in the Saudi workforce. Yes, there are practical economic reasons for wanting higher employment for Saudi women, like expanding the country's talent pool. And in a world where an increasing number of women are key decisionmakers across both businesses and governments, the country's refusal to allow women to drive was an unnecessary millstone around Saudi necks.\n\nBut more than all that, the reforms were intended to deliver a clear message to the West that Saudi society is changing. The response: a sudden surge of interest in investment in Saudi Arabia. And for a while there, this story of a new Saudi Arabia \u2014 more open and transparent, willing to play by Western rules \u2014 seemed to be taking hold. That narrative was so strong that it withstood a Saudi-backed humanitarian disaster raging in Yemen, a postponed IPO of Saudi Arabia's oil giant Aramco, and a crackdown on women activists who began demanding more freedoms. The world proved willing to overlook plenty to protect the investment gold rush \u2014 until the Khashoggi murder (and the political drama Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan masterfully drew out) made it impossible to do so any longer.\n\nRiyadh's saving grace is that countries with significant geopolitical interests in the Middle East will have a hard time breaking financial ties with the Saudis, given the Kingdom's outsized importance in the region. Germany may have decided to freeze arm sales to Riyadh for the time being, but no other major power has followed suit thus far (and Germany was drawing down its arms sales to Riyadh over human rights concerns long before the Khashoggi murder). Given its own geopolitical calculations, the US government is frantically attempting to give the Saudis the benefit of the doubt at every turn, even as each turn leads down a darker and darker path. It's a testament to Saudi Arabia's continued international influence.\n\nBut geopolitical necessities are no replacement for genuine enthusiasm for doing business with the Kingdom, which is what the Saudis will need if Vision 2030 is to be successful.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN)-- \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0639\u064a\u060c \u0646\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u060c \u0639\u0628\u0631 \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \"\u062a\u0648\u064a\u062a\u0631\"\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633\u060c \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0627 \u0625\u0646 \"\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u062a\u0631\u0641 \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0647 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\".\n\n\u0648\u063a\u0631\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0639\u064a \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0627 \u0625\u0646 \"\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0642\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u0642\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a\u0646\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u064a\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0644\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0643\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0623\u062f\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0641\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0625\u0646 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\".\n\n\u0648\u0623\u0636\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0639\u064a \u0623\u0646 \"\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u062a\u0631\u0641 \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0647 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\"\u060c \u0644\u064a\u062e\u062a\u062a\u0645 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0647: \"\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0643\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0648\u0628\u0639\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0641\u0649 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0646\u062d\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b. \u0645\u0635\u0631 \u0633\u062a\u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0628\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639\u0627\"\u060c \u062d\u0633\u0628 \u062a\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0647.", "(CNN) NASA's Dawn spacecraft has run out of fuel and dropped out of contact with mission control, the agency said Thursday.\n\nThis ends the spacecraft's 11-year mission, which sent it on a 4.3 billion-mile journey to two of the largest objects in our solar system's main asteroid belt.

Recall that GE was severely hurt when the commercial paper market froze during the 2008 financial crisis. Eventually the Federal Reserve stepped in with a rescue.\n\nThe top tier of the commercial paper market is only open to companies with the sturdieset balance sheets. GE and its $115 billion of debt no longer qualify.\n\nGE lost access to the top tier after Moody's Investors Services downgraded the company's short-term credit rating on Wednesday in part because of its \"deteriorating\" power business. The downgrade followed a similar move by S&P Global Ratings in early October.\n\nGE can still tap the second tier of the commercial paper market, but that corner of the market is smaller and more expensive. It's probably not big enough to meet all of GE's vast funding needs, according to Rene Lipsch, senior credit officer at Moody's. GE and GE Capital issued as much as $14.8 billion in commercial paper last quarter.\n\n\"Due to GE's high intra-quarter funding needs,\" Lipsch wrote in an email, \"GE will have to utilize its revolving credit facilities, which will result in an increase in funding costs.\"\n\nIn other words, GE's borrowing costs are going up because of its weakened balance sheet.\n\n\"Nobody leaves\" commercial paper \"voluntarily,\" Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit, a corporate bond research firm, wrote in an email.\n\nGE shares slumped 5% on Thursday and closed below $10 for the first time since March 2009.\n\nReduced flexibility\n\nGE announced its retreat from the commercial paper market on Tuesday, a day before the well-telegraphed Moody's downgrade. Jamie Miller, GE's chief financial officer, said the plan is to reduce GE Capital's commercial paper balance to zero by the end of the year and reduce the overall company to a \"smaller\" level as well.\n\nThe good news is that GE has already been moving to shrink its short-term borrowings. And GE has $40 billion of credit lines with banks that it can use to fund the business. Miller said GE has tapped a \"portion\" of these revolvers.\n\nThe problem is that bank lines are more expensive and restrictive than the commercial paper market, which allows companies to quickly refinance their debt.\n\n\"This is a sign of reduced financial flexibility,\" Levenson said.\n\n\"GE has a sound liquidity position, including cash and operating credit lines,\" a GE spokesperson said in a statement. \"The downgrade is manageable and we are prepared for it.\"\n\nGE added that it's committed to strengthening its balance sheet by reducing leverage.\n\nDividend cut not enough\n\nThe painful dividend cut announced on Tuesday will save GE about $4 billion a year. The company is also planning to raise about $20 billion by getting rid of various businesses, including the healthcare division and its majority stake in oil and gas firm Baker Hughes.\n\nHowever, those sales -- combined with the deep problems in its power division -- will also decrease GE's earnings firepower.\n\nDespite GE's shrinking profits, its debt still remains hefty. GE and GE Capital listed total borrowings of $115 billion at the end of the third quarter, compared with $126 billion at the end of 2017.\n\nAfter posting weaker-than-expected results on Tuesday, GE pushed back the timing on when it will achieve a stronger balance sheet. The company's new goal is to reduce its debt-to-earnings ratio to 2.5 over the \"next few years.\" GE previously said it would hit this healthier leverage target by 2020.", "Washington (CNN) Oprah Winfrey delivered an impassioned call to voters Thursday in a fiery stump speech in support of Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.\n\n\"For anybody here who has an ancestor who didn't have the right to vote, and you are choosing not to vote -- wherever you are in this state, in this country -- you are dishonoring your family,\" Winfrey said in Marietta, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb. \"You are disrespecting and disregarding their legacy, their suffering and their dreams, when you don't vote.\"\n\nThe hotly contested Georgia governor's race has garnered national attention and is currently neck and neck.

Kemp has since said the 53,000 Georgians would be able to vote in November.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the controversy, Winfrey said, \"Every single one of us -- every single one of us -- has the same power at the polls, and every single one of us has something that, if done in numbers too big to tamper with\" -- she paused for resounding, prolonged applause by the audience -- \"cannot be suppressed and cannot be denied.\"\n\nRead More", "La administraci\u00f3n tratar\u00e1 de exigir a los migrantes que soliciten asilo en los puntos de entrada legales, y evitar\u00e1 que soliciten asilo si son atrapados cruzando la frontera ilegalmente\n\n(CNN) - Un ayudante de la Casa Blanca dijo que se espera que el presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, use su discurso de inmigraci\u00f3n de este jueves para anunciar cambios en la forma en que los migrantes pueden solicitar asilo.

According to three people familiar with the matter at the time, the NCA had been handed a cache of Banks' emails detailing meetings he had with the Russian ambassador to the UK, during which he was offered sweetheart deals.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) Google employees around the world are calling for sweeping changes in how the company handles sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\nEmployees walked out of their offices on Thursday in a coordinated protest over what they call a \"destructive culture\" at the company. They are demanding five main changes, according to a post on an Instagram account dedicated to the walkout.\n\nGoogle employees say they want: An end to forced arbitration in harassment and discrimination cases; a commitment to end pay and opportunity inequity; a sexual harassment transparency report disclosed to the public; a clear inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct safely and anonymously; and for the chief diversity officer to report directly to the CEO and make recommendations to the board of directors, as well as the appointment of an employee representative to the board.\n\nThe walkout was prompted by a New York Times investigation last week, which detailed years of sexual harassment allegations, multimillion-dollar severance packages for executives accused of misconduct, and little transparency over the cases.\n\nIn an op-ed for New York Magazine on Thursday, the seven core organizers said Google employees \"demand an end to the sexual harassment, discrimination, and the systemic racism that fuel this destructive culture.\"\n\n\"The [New York Times] article provided a narrow window into a culture we, as Google employees, know well. These stories are our stories. We share them in hushed tones to trusted peers, friends, and partners. There are thousands of us, at every level of the company. And we've had enough,\" they wrote.\n\nOne of the author's of the piece, Celie O'Neil-Hart, told reporters outside the Mountain View protest she was proud of the response from employees.\"We're really representing a movement at Google for a long time,\" she said. \"We do feel heard, yes. We look forward to action.\"\n\nThe op-ed also included more details about their five demands to company leadership.\n\nFor example, the organizers said Google should ensure there are women of color at all levels of the company.\n\n\"This must be accompanied by transparent data on the gender, race and ethnicity compensation gap, across both level and years of industry experience, accessible to all Google and Alphabet employees and contractors,\" they added.\n\nMeanwhile, the public sexual harassment transparency report should include information such as the number of harassment claims at the company over time and in which product area, as well as any exit packages and their value.\n\nThe organizers also said the current process for reporting sexual misconduct is not working.\n\n\"HRs' performance is assessed by senior management and directors, forcing them to put management's interests ahead of employees reporting harassment and discrimination,\" they wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, Google employees around the world walked out of their offices at 11:10 a.m. local time.

He is a spokesman for Color of Change PAC . The views expressed here are solely the author's. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Too often in the past, black politics in America has focused on black pain. In 2018, we needed to shift our focus from fear and black pain to resiliency and building black power. It's what our community calls black joy.\n\nThere is much for us to feel pain about. We have marched to assert that our lives matter, in the face of police violence. We have organized against white supremacy in the White House. We have put our voices into our votes to elect representatives who will work to overcome the glaring disparities in our life expectancy poverty and education . Voting while black means facing the trauma and reality of living in a country where many don't want us to exist at all.\n\nIn Georgia, the Republican candidate for governor is also the secretary of state, where he has overseen a voter purge of more than 50,000 mostly black Georgians and a system that literally told a group of elderly black people to get off the bus when they tried to vote. Others face three-hour lines to vote and polling places far from home.\n\nYou could hardly blame us for not turning out to vote. And yet it is black voters powering the progressive wave this year.\n\nIn December, black women made the difference in the upset election of Doug Jones to the Senate from deep red Alabama. Roughly 56% of Jones' total votes came from black voters , even though we are only 27% of the state's population . Black turnout drove historic victories in this year's primaries in Georgia and Florida, two states with a deep legacy of racism both poised to elect their first black governors in Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, respectively.\n\nCentering black joy is how my organization, Color of Change PAC, has been able to help drive big changes in black voter turnout this year. We organized with partners in Ferguson, Missouri, to help Wesley Bell win the Democratic nomination as the top prosecutor in St. Louis County, and turnout in that township in this year's primary was an incredible 70% higher than it was in 2014 , thanks to the efforts of 8,000 local Color of Change PAC members and our partners. In three heavily black precincts we and partners organized in Durham, North Carolina, where turnout had been in the single digits, 17% more voters cast ballots in 2018 than in 2014\n\nBlack joy is about celebrating the power of black people, even as we acknowledge the pain.\n\nTake our election programming: We have held more than 60 \"Black Joy\" events across the country this year, and by our count, more than 12,000 people have attended. In Atlanta in mid-October, more than 1,200 people turned out to learn how to canvass, share a meal and talk about what's at stake. By Election Day, \"Black Joy brunches,\" cookouts and neighborhood block parties will have generated more than half a million text messages to voters, and 50,000-plus homes visited in black neighborhoods.\n\nThis isn't a new idea. When I was young, I would go into the voting booth with my grandfather. He would let me pull the lever for him. I didn't realize until he died he couldn't read or write. He learned about who to vote for by engaging in his church, and talking to folks there about the issues that mattered to them. This approach is community organizing 101, which the Democratic Party has largely forgotten. We have to be there for people 365 days a year, not just when we're trying to win an election.\n\nWhen we invite people to a \"Black Joy\" event, we don't start by talking about the issues, we start by talking about community. We talk about building something that's independent and our own, which is what the black community has done for centuries with its churches, its culture and its institutions. When you marry that old-school approach with modern data-targeting techniques, you can bring a new people into the conversation, and they can help change that conversation.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a black woman from the suburbs went from avoiding politics altogether to helping us run a sophisticated volunteer recruitment operation. In Michigan, we recruited more than 700 volunteers who have never participated in politics before to join our texting or canvassing campaigns. The woman leading our effort to pass Amendment 4 in Florida, which would re-enfranchise formerly incarcerated people, is formerly incarcerated herself.\n\nJUST WATCHED Black seniors pulled off 'Get Out the Vote' bus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Black seniors pulled off 'Get Out the Vote' bus 02:06\n\nThese folks aren't motivated by trying to stop something; they are driven by the hope of building something together with other black people.\n\nTo be clear, black joy doesn't mean there is an absence of black pain. We live that pain every day. But black joy is how we keep going in the face of it. For example, many organizations ask their volunteers to text voters. But while other organizations encourage people to do it alone, we invite volunteers to text-a-thon parties. Being black and political comes with risks, and any volunteer sending texts on our behalf for an hour is certain to get at least one racist text back. Suffering racism on your own is painful. Suffering it in a community is still painful, but the pain is shared. We pass around the phone. \"Can you believe what he called me?\" we ask. And then we laugh.\n\nWill black joy be enough to change American politics? It will if we stick with it, and see politics as a way to build power in the face of injustice. It means not just electing the leaders we want, but holding those leaders accountable after the election, work that we're already organizing to do. It means demanding tangible progress on the issues that matter directly to the community, such as mass incarceration, voting rights and economic justice.\n\nFor more opinion...

And we weren't surprised to see white supremacy come out of the shadows.

Eso quiere decir que se murieron 5,7 personas de cada 1.000, una tasa superior a toda la serie hist\u00f3rica desde 2008, de acuerdo con estas mismas cifras oficiales.\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de estas muertes se registraron en Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (donde la tasa fue de 6,8 muertes por cada 1.000 habitantes), Chihuahua (con una tasa de 6,5) y Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave (6,3).

En concreto, la inmensa mayor\u00eda (el 88,6%) de las muertes fueron por problemas de salud y el 11,4% por causas externas: principalmente accidentes (36.215), homicidios (32.079) y suicidios (6.559).\n\nComo se puede observar en el siguiente gr\u00e1fico, las principales causas de muerte son enfermedades del coraz\u00f3n, diabetes y tumores. Sin embargo, hay ciertas diferencias entre sexos: los hombres sufren muchos m\u00e1s homicidios que las mujeres, por ejemplo.\n\nMIRA: Aumentan 26% los puntos cr\u00edticos de homicidios en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nSe les cita en d\u00edas que no existen o en horas en las que los tribunales est\u00e1n cerrados\n\n(CNN) - Las filas serpentearon alrededor de la cuadra afuera de los tribunales de inmigraci\u00f3n en todo Estados Unidos el mi\u00e9rcoles.

Now the show is coming to an end.\n\nApple said Thursday it plans to stop reporting how many iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells each quarter, in what could be a nod to flatlining growth in some of these product lines. Apple will continue to report revenue for these categories.\n\nThe move was just one of the concerning announcements Apple made Thursday. The company also said it expects sales in the all-important holiday quarter to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, skewing short of analyst estimates. At the low end of that range, Apple's holiday sales would be little improved from the record $88.3 billion it reported a year ago.\n\nApple stock fell as much as 7% in after hours trading Thursday following the earnings report. If those losses hold, Apple risks losing its status as the lone trillion-dollar company.\n\nThe holiday sales forecast is closely watched as it offers the first real glimpse into expected demand for Apple's new lineup of iPhones . The pricier iPhone XS and XS Max went on sale in the final days of the September quarter, and the more affordable XR went on sale last month.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

championships for the fourth time, the most ever in women's artistic gymnastics.\n\nBiles, 21, uncharacteristically struggled in the competition Thursday in Doha, Qatar, just days after tweeting she'd put off having a kidney stone removed until after the competition.\n\nBut despite a fall on the vault, a fall on the balance beam and stepping out of bounds during her floor exercise routine, Biles still won by 1.693 points -- the largest margin of victory of her four titles.\n\n.@Simone_Biles wins the 2018 World AA Title! \ud83e\udd47 @morgihurd gets the bronze! \ud83e\udd49\n\n\n\nSimone's

She still can add to her medal haul in the individual vault, uneven bars, beam and floor events.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) President Donald Trump threw some red meat to his base this week and claimed he was prepared to defy the Constitution and end birthright citizenship in the US.\n\nHis comments led to cheers from immigration hardliners, outrage from his Democratic critics and a few notable rebukes from senior Republicans in Congress who usually stand behind him.\n\nTrump botched some claims about birthright citizenship, such as when he said the US is the only country with that law. Many countries offer the same. A number of legal experts say it is highly unlikely he can end the practice with an executive order-- as did Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\n\nThe timing of the proposal dovetails with the President's broader efforts to make the midterm election about illegal immigration, a topic that animates his base. Trump and his allies tie birthright citizenship to the broader effort to curtail illegal immigration.\n\nBeyond the impassioned political debate, here are some numbers to know that add context and explain the broader trends that are going on.\n\nHow many children are here?\n\nMore than 4 million children born in the United States live here with at least one undocumented parent, according to the latest numbers from the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. These children are US citizens due to the birthright citizenship provision of the 14th Amendment.\n\nAbout 55% of those children live with one undocumented parent or two undocumented parents. The remaining 45% live with one undocumented parent and another who is here legally.\n\nThese 4 million children represent a large cohort in this category, which is sometimes, including by the President, pejoratively called \"anchor babies.\" But it's important to remember that people who are here legally -- on work visas, for instance -- sometimes give birth to kids on US soil.\n\nAt a rally Wednesday night, Trump railed against birthright citizenship and said it \"created an entire industry of birth tourism.\" He's right that an underground enterprise exists around pregnant foreigners coming to the US for the purpose of having their baby on American soil. There have been federal raids over the years against so-called \"maternity hotels\" that cater to these women. The Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit that wants to reduce immigration, roughly estimates about 36,000 of these births in each year.\n\nIt is actually slowing down\n\nWhat's often lost in the political debate is that illegal immigration to the US is on the decline. The number of undocumented immigrants in the US peaked during the mid-2000s and has continued falling.\n\nAs a result, the number of babies born in the US each year to undocumented immigrants is also declining. After steadily increasing since the 1980s, this figure peaked in 2007 at 370,000 births. Since then, each year has seen fewer births than the previous year, according to the Pew Research Center. Even as the overall numbers have declined, as a percentage of total US births, this group has seen its share increase. The nonpartisan group says the most recent data is from 2014.\n\n\"This trend matches a number of other trends that we've seen among unauthorized immigrants,\" said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of global migration and demography research at the Pew Research Center. \"Generally speaking, that population has been in decline.\"\n\nRepeal creates new issues\n\nThere is another wrinkle: undocumented immigrants who are already in the United States will continue to have babies, even if birthright citizenship goes away. Instead of becoming citizens, those kids will be undocumented, even without crossing any borders.\n\n\"Those kids would have no pathway to legal citizenship, and they would accumulate over time,\" said Michael Fix, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank based in Washington. \"And there's a share of them who will have kids of their own, and they'll become undocumented immigrants as well.\"\n\nRepealing birthright citizenship would cause the number of undocumented immigrants to more than double by 4.7 million by 2050, according to a 2015 study co-authored by Fix and other scholars. The study noted that 1 million of those kids would be \"the children of two parents who themselves have been born in the United States.\"\n\nAs non-citizens, these 4.7 million people would stop receiving government benefits like Medicaid and in-state tuition at public universities. But Fix pointed out that they also would be forced into the \"underground economy\" which doesn't serve anyone's best interests.\n\nMost Americans oppose repeal\n\nBirthright citizenship hasn't made such a splash since fall 2015, when the topic became a flashpoint in the Republican presidential primaries.\n\nAmong adults nationwide, 62% believed the law should stand, according to a Marist poll from September 2015. And 60% of Americans opposed changing the Constitution to repeal the birthright provision, according to a Pew Research Center survey from October 2015.\n\nBoth polls found a partisan split. Democrats and independents support birthright citizenship, while slim majorities of Republicans oppose it. This helps explain why Trump raised the issue during the GOP primaries and revived it this week, as he rallies his base ahead of the midterms.", "\u0646\u0638\u0645 \u0645\u0626\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0638\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0634\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u063a\u0648\u063a\u0644\u060c \u0625\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633\u060c \u0627\u062d\u062a\u062c\u0627\u062c\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0639 \u0642\u0636\u0627\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0633\u064a\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633 \u060c 01 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Washington (CNN) Moderate Republican lawmakers distanced themselves on Thursday from the racist video shared by President Donald Trump's campaign, with at least one House member saying the video is endangering vulnerable GOP candidates fighting to keep the party's House majority.\n\nThe video, which was tweeted by Trump six days before the midterm elections, accuses Democrats, without evidence, of plotting to help people it depicts as Central American invaders overrun the nation with cop killers.\n\nFlorida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who has opposed parts of Trump's agenda in the past, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on \"Newsroom\" that the ad is politically divisive.\n\n\"It's definitely part of a divide and conquer strategy that a lot of politicians, including the President, have used successfully in the past,\" he told Sciutto. \"I hope this doesn't work. I hope that type of strategy starts failing in our country, but that's up to the American people.\"\n\n\"If we continue getting divided, if our politics continues growing more and more violent, our democracy is going to be at real risk,\" he added.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's new Willie Horton-style web video posted to Twitter on Wednesday night represented a new flashpoint in a culture war he is stoking ahead of next week's midterm elections. But it also came as part of a broader strategy GOP candidates are using in key House, Senate and governor's races.\n\nRepublican candidates and outside groups involved in tough races, particularly in deep-red states and districts where turning out the conservative base is all that matters, are airing television advertisements stoking fears and spreading misinformation about the group of migrants still 900 miles from the Southern border.\n\nIt's the GOP's closing argument in Tennessee, where Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who faces Democratic former governor Phil Bredesen in a competitive Senate race, has aired ads that mention the \"caravan\" nearly 800 times, according to an analysis by Kantar/CMAG, which tracks political ads.\n\nOne Blackburn ad describes the migrants as \"gang members, known criminals, people from the Middle East, possibly even terrorists.\" A narrator says that \"Marsha Blackburn will stand with Trump to build the wall and stop the caravan.\"\n\nThe migrants, traveling as a group for safety, have left their home countries and are heading to the United States. Trump and his allies have tried to stoke fears about the group and tie them to Democrats ahead of the midterm elections. There have been no reports, in the press or publicly from intelligence agencies, to suggest there are people from the Middle East embedded in the caravan.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has also aired ads attacking Bredesen. \"The caravan is coming, yet Bredesen is too liberal to care,\" a narrator says in one ad.\n\nThe ads mimic a strategy Trump set into motion weeks ago. Ignoring some Republicans' pleas to put a booming economy at the forefront in the midterms, the President has launched an all-out culture war depicting immigrants, particularly Latinos, as a threat to the nation. He said Wednesday he might send 15,000 troops -- three times the number currently fighting ISIS in Iraq -- to meet the group of migrants. He has hyped it as an imminent threat, even though the group is shrinking in numbers and still weeks from the border.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Trump escalated his race-fueled campaign further, posting on Twitter a video produced by the Republican consulting firm Jamestown Associates that depicts Democrats as plotting to help people they depict as Central American invaders overrun the nation with cop killers.\n\nThe web ad features Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man who had previously been deported but returned to the United States and was convicted in February in the killing of two California deputies.\n\n\"I'm going to kill more cops soon,\" Bracamontes is shown saying in court as captions flash across the screen reading, \"Democrats let him into our country. Democrats let him stay.\"\n\nThe web ad recalled the 1988 \"Willie Horton\" ad backed by supporters of George H.W. Bush's presidential campaign. It depicted Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis as responsible for the rape Horton, a convicted murderer, committed while out of prison while furloughed under a Massachusetts program. The ad was seen as playing into white fear and racist stereotypes of African-American.\n\nThirty years later, Trump's spot is the Willie Horton ad on steroids -- and playing into the same racist stereotypes, this time with Latino immigrants.\n\nA source close to the White House described the web ad as well as Trump's immigration push as \"changing the argument from family unification to invasion.\"\n\n\"It's clearly working. We are all talking about it and not health care,\" the source added.\n\nNew CNN polls underscore why Republicans -- who widely view maintaining control of the House as a long-shot but see turning out conservatives in key Senate races as an opportunity to expand their majority there -- are all-in on a strategy of fear-mongering over racial divides.\n\nIn Arizona, 50% of Republican likely voters say immigration is the most important issue -- up from 35% in September. And in Nevada, 42% of Republican likely voters identified immigration as the most important issue, an increase from 28% in September. Both states feature competitive Senate races.\n\nWhat's not clear: Whether Republican voters' shifting views are a response to Trump's messaging, or whether Trump and other GOP candidates are shifting their messaging as a reaction to the movement in their base.\n\nSome Republicans running in more moderate territory have broken with Trump over his fear mongering on immigration. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican running for re-election in a district Hillary Clinton won in 2016, called the new web ad \"part of a divide-and-conquer strategy.\"\n\n\"I hope this doesn't work. I hope that type of strategy starts failing in our country,\" Curbelo told CNN's \"New Day\" Thursday morning.\n\nHowever, candidates and outside groups in other competitive races where Republicans' primary concern is turning out their base are also airing ads stoking fears about the group of migrants.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, the House Speaker Paul Ryan-aligned super PAC, launched an ad in Minnesota's 1st District -- a largely pro-Trump district that is among the GOP's best chances of flipping a House seat -- casting Democratic candidate Dan Feehan as \"weak on border security, soft on crime.\"\n\n\"A caravan of illegal immigrants marching on America. Over 7,000 strong, the caravan is full of gang members and criminals,\" a narrator says. It has aired 124 times, per Kantar/CMAG.\n\nIn South Carolina's 1st District, Republican Katie Arrington highlights \"an MS-13 killer arrested in the Low Country; a caravan of illegal immigrants marching on our border; Democrat Joe Cunningham, campaigning with the sanctuary city mayor of L.A.; the Pelosi agenda, open borders, undermining law enforcement.\" It has aired 125 times, per Kantar/CMAG.\n\nA GOP group in Texas aired an ad accusing Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who is challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, of cheering on the migrants. \"The caravan is coming, some say criminals among them. But there's Beto O'Rourke, cheering them on,\" a narrator says\n\nTwo other Republican Senate candidates, state Sen. Leah Vukmir in Wisconsin and Corey Stewart in Virginia, have also advertised about the \"caravan.\" Stewart's ad has run 469 times, per Kantar/CMAG.\n\nIn Kansas, Republican gubernatorial candidate and staunch Trump ally Kris Kobach uses footage of Fox News personality Tucker Carlson discussing the group of migrants growing \"more massive by the day.\"\n\nWhat those candidates all have in common: They need to jolt the conservative base before Tuesday's midterms. In Blackburn and Cruz's cases, both will win if Republicans turn out to vote. The same is true in Minnesota's 1st District, where Republican Jim Hagedorn hopes to win the retiring Rep. Tim Walz's seat. In Vukmir and Stewart's cases, both are underdogs worried that Republican voters will sit out the race.\n\nOn most of the map -- especially the states and districts where the partisan makeup is more balanced -- Republicans have generally not made the \"caravan\" their focal point in the closing days of the midterms. Still, most aren't displeased to see Trump driving a cultural message of fear.\n\n\"It's incendiary, I get it,\" one Nevada Republican said of the Trump ad. \"It's a turnout game, and it fires up people on both sides.\"", "(CNN) Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, King Salman's brother and a critic of his nephew Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has traveled back to Saudi Arabia, a source familiar with the prince's movement told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThe senior Saudi prince returned to Riyadh after two-and-a-half months overseas, the source said.\n\nThe New York Times, Reuters and the Financial Times reported that the prince's return had sparked speculation about his role in the kingdom's crisis management efforts following the international outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe source speaking to CNN didn't clarify the reasons and significance of the prince's return or if he had indeed sought assurances for his safety after spending time abroad.\n\nKhashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist and critic of the regime, was last seen entering the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on October 2.\n\nThe Saudis have presented shifting accounts around the death of the 59-year-old journalist, initially denying any knowledge before arguing that a group of rogue operators, many of whom belong to bin Salman's inner circle, were responsible. The Saudi attorney general has since acknowledged that Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated murder.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Washington Post , citing an unnamed senior Turkish official, reported a theory that Turkish authorities are pursuing that Khoshoggi's body was destroyed in acid on the grounds of the Saudi Consulate or the Saudi Consul General's residence.\n\nA source close to the Saudi Royal Palace told CNN last week that the location of Khashoggi's body was not known to the Saudis. The source said the body was handed over to a local \"collaborator\" after the killing, adding that it is not at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\n\nSaudi Arabia has detained 18 people and dismissed five high-ranking officials , including the crown prince's media chief and the deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, as it continues its investigation into the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nSecurity camera footage shows Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate on October 2.\n\nWhat's behind prince's return?\n\nPrince Ahmed served as deputy interior minister for decades before briefly taking on the role of interior minister in 2012.\n\nIn September, suggestions of a royal family rift emerged after Prince Ahmed was caught on camera distancing himself from the royal family when talking to anti-Saudi protesters in London.\n\nResponding to the heckling crowd who were reportedly angry over the kingdom's involvement in the ongoing Yemen conflict, the Prince appeared to say the entire family of Al-Saud was not to blame for the violence in Yemen, just his brother and the nephew.\n\nIn light of the apparent criticism, Prince Ahmed released a short statement through state-run Saudi Press Agency , in which he clarified that \"the king and the crown prince are responsible for the state and its decisions.\"\n\n\"This is true for the security and stability of the country and the people. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret what I said in any other way,\" the statement continued.\n\nPrince Ahmed's return home comes as Saudi Arabia's royal family faces increasing pressure to clarify the circumstances surrounding Khashoggi's death.\n\nKing Salman ascended the throne in 2015, ushering in a new era of Saudi politics with the help of his son, Prince Mohammed, who he promoted to crown prince -- making him heir apparent -- in June 2017\n\nThe crown prince has since tried to craft an image of himself as a young reformist pushing the Saudi kingdom into the 21st century with his economic and social reforms. But he has also been consolidating his power, stifling dissent and marginalizing senior royals and government ministers\n\nWhile it does not appear that the prince's homecoming will change the kingdom's plans for succession, Gregory Gause, a Saudi expert at Texas A&M University, says it does suggest the Saudi royal family may be trying to internally restructure the dynasty.\n\n\"What's going to happen when he goes back is opaque. ... I don't think that he has the kind of profile that would make him a serious challenger for the top spot but he is one of the most senior members of the family who has political experience,\" Gause told CNN. \"He was always a number two from almost all of his time in government.\n\n\"But he has standing in the family and if there is an effort going on within the family to try to come up with a formula, not so much to replace the crown prince but to restrain him by putting some more senior people from the family into important decision-making positions, the return of Prince Ahmed would be consistent with that kind of maneuver,\" Gause said.\n\nGause added that the return indicates that the House of Al-Saud understands that Khashoggi's killing \"has changed the political climate to an extent that they have do to something if relationships are going to be sustained at their current level.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're also seeing that with the US and UK coming out with a more high-level call for some kind of negotiations on Yemen.\"\n\nUS Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called earlier this week for a ceasefire in Yemen to be reached \"in the next 30 days.\"\n\nUN envoy to Yemen Martin Griffith agreed Thursday that Khashoggi's murder appears to have played a part in prompting the surprise American government call for a ceasefire.\n\nThere was already the beginning of a strong desire to move from war to peace, Griffith said in an interview with CNN's Becky Anderson, but issues including Khashoggi's murder \"have catalyzed interests in these countries.\"", "London (CNN Business) A former top executive at JPMorgan Chase is betting big on Deutsche Bank.\n\nHudson Executive Capital, an activist hedge fund led by former JPMorgan ( JPM ) finance chief Doug Braunstein, revealed Thursday that it has bought a 3.1% stake in Germany's biggest lender.\n\nThe vote of confidence helped push shares in Deutsche Bank ( DB ) up nearly 3%, a rare reprieve for a stock that has dropped over 40% in 2018 and hit a record low earlier this week.\n\nHudson said in a statement that it had bought roughly \u20ac570 million ($650 million) worth of shares after conducting over a year of research into Deutsche Bank.\n\nIt's been a year of turmoil at the bank.\n\nan overhaul under which Deutsche Bank has closed hundreds of branches, cut thousands of jobs and aggressively slashed costs.

His larger-than-life art installations remix the elements and shock the senses to provoke a reaction, physical as much as emotional, in the viewer.\n\nFor his seminal 2003 installation \"The Weather Project,\" he put the sun and the sky in a hall of London's Tate Modern gallery, complete with 200 lamps, mist machines and its own weather forecast service. People reacted to it in unprecedented ways: They started lying down to watch themselves in the mirrored ceiling, organized picnics, came in fancy dress -- someone even brought a canoe.\n\nOlafur Eliasson's \"The Weather Project.\" Credit: Phaidon\n\nSuch a reaction is what he was hoping for: \"When we are in a museum or a gallery, we are in a space in which exploration feels possible. It's a situation where we've been cultivated to take more risks than we would in a street or a private space,\" said the Danish-Icelandic artist who's in London for the release of Phaidon's \" Olafur Eliasson: Experience, \" a guide to three decades of his art.\n\n\"You behave differently when you're moving through an art installation, which allows you to explore movement and the consequences on your body. It drives your brain into your body. It connects them at least.\"\n\nThis is what great cultural institutions are there for, Eliasson said. \"They are an opportunity for people to almost do a little fact-checking: Do I actually feel myself or have I become numb? That's why it's sometimes hard work to go to a museum -- it's not like going to a shopping mall, where you're just being pleased, you're kind of sleepwalking. In a great cultural institution, you're being provoked, and you have to have an opinion about something.\"\n\nThe awe-inspiring art of Olafur Eliasson\n\n\"The Weather Project\" didn't immediately stimulate an environmental discussion -- in 2003 climate action was hardly the order of the day -- but it undoubtedly represents Eliasson's first step into that arena. Since then, he's often earned the moniker of \"environmental artist.\"\n\nIn 2015, as world leaders were about to sign the Paris climate agreement, which the United States withdrew from in 2017, Eliasson put 12 massive blocks of glacial ice in a Parisian street for people to touch. Harvested as free-floating icebergs from a fjord in Greenland, they were meant as a stark reminder of the critical state of the Arctic ice caps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 18 Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson has created several spectacular waterfalls, including this one in Versailles, near Paris, in 2016.

And it struck me that people would say, 'Oh! This is cold!' -- even though theoretically we know very well that ice is cold. But it just shows us that the physical relationship with the world and the knowledge about the world are disconnected.\"\n\n\"Riverbed,\" a 2014 installation made with water and Icelandic rock, at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art.

An emotional experience, on the other hand, can be a stronger driver of behavioral change than theoretical data.\n\n\"Climate awareness has never been so high,\" he said. \"There is basically no place in the world where a 12-year-old does not know what global warming is. We are reaching the point where everybody on the whole planet is being introduced to the notion of the greenhouse effect. So the headlines are not so good, but the trends underneath is. We don't see convergence, we don't see execution, we don't see commitment yet. But I do think we are seeing change.\"\n\nThat the cultural sector has been a massive source of that change is not surprising to Eliasson: \"There is more money in the cultural sector than in the car industry,\" he said. \"We just forget it because it's decentralized, it's messy, it's chaotic. We think it's a small thing but it's not, it's like a huge network of things that are actually reflecting on critical questions.\"\n\nCan art save the world then? Eliasson said he is optimistic about the power, and the responsibility, of culture to inspire action despite \"a lot of old institutions still governed by old white guys with white hair who have been sitting there way too long.\"\n\n\"How can we organize our narrative so that we can have a more intimate relationship with the greater civic society? Maybe the cultural sector can offer solutions to some of the things that politicians are struggling with, such as not reacting on the climate -- because they're not,\" he said.\n\nEliasson has often earned the moniker of \"environmental artist.\" Credit: Phaidon\n\nIn 2012, Eliasson founded Little Sun , a company that makes solar-powered products designed to replace kerosene lamps and power small electrical items in areas without a grid, such as sub-Saharan Africa.

This is what we have come to expect from a president who has built his career on sowing racial division and has placed all his bets on white nationalism as a winning midterm electoral strategy. But it is disappointing and detestable nonetheless.\n\n\"In Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country!\" Trump tweeted. Gillum immediately responded : \"On Twitter there is a choice between having the courage to @ the person you are trash talking, or not. @realDonaldTrump is howling because he's weak. Florida, go vote today.\"\n\nGillum, who would become Florida's first African-American governor, is running against Ron DeSantis, who until recently was a member of Congress. DeSantis won the GOP primary by modeling himself as a Trump acolyte, and since that time, he has used racist dog whistles, telling Floridians not to \" monkey this up \" by voting for his opponent. In addition, he addressed ACT For America , an anti-Muslim hate group, making statements that played to fears about refugees and immigrants. Meanwhile, racist robocalls to Florida voters, complete with jungle and chimpanzee sounds, refer to Gillum as a \"negro.\" An Idaho-based white supremacist website and podcast called \"Road to Power\" paid for the robocalls.\n\nAs one of the original promoters of birtherism -- the conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was born in a foreign country and is not a US citizen -- Trump is no stranger to race-baiting, dehumanizing and criminalizing black and brown people for political gain. He called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of minority men who were wrongfully convicted of rape and doubled down when DNA evidence overturned their convictions. More recently, the President called Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California a \" low IQ person \" and his former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman a \" dog .\" He also said Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia, is \" crime loving \" and \" totally unqualified .\"\n\nNow, two years after a campaign that sowed racial division and with two years of racially offensive policies ranging from the Muslim ban to the detention of Latino migrant children at the southern border, Trump and his GOP minions are engaging in a midterm strategy that Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii called a \" toxic racist stew .\" In an effort to energize the base after failing to build the wall and after the GOP failed to sell the tax cuts and the economy or kill Obamacare, the self-proclaimed nationalist has made this a migrant caravan election, seizing on the journey of immigrants and asylum-seekers from Central America to conjure images of George Soros-funded foreign invaders overtaking the border to spread violence and disease. Trump, who called Mexicans rapists and murderers during his presidential campaign, now posts videos on Twitter depicting caravans of criminals rushing toward the border.\n\nRobert Bowers, the alleged mass murderer at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, agreed with the anti-Semitic and nativist messaging that Trump apparently believes is a winning plan for the election. This could explain why Trump stood alone , without any other government officials, Republicans or Democrats, when he visited Pittsburgh on Tuesday.\n\nThen there's Trump's proposed unconstitutional executive order to end birthright citizenship, which is a dangerous stunt that invokes repeal of the 14th Amendment, one of the Reconstruction amendments enacted by Republicans after slavery to guarantee US citizenship to everyone born in the country. A president cannot change the Constitution by executive order -- and in this case, punish people of color in the process -- but perhaps a conservative Supreme Court would oblige.\n\nJUST WATCHED Gillum on DeSantis: Racists call him racist Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gillum on DeSantis: Racists call him racist 02:13\n\nIt is no secret that there is much at stake in this midterm election, which is perhaps the most important election in generations and arguably a most consequential contest on the federal level for the future of this democracy. Elections in key battleground states, such as Florida, are important because party control of a state government determines the drawing of electoral maps and the ability to push a particular agenda on the local level. Certainly, Trump is making a calculation that the prospect of Andrew Gillum, a black governor of a Southern state, would signal national demographic changes and scare his white nationalist base to the polls.\n\nTrump's reputation is on the line. The GOP, a ruling party appealing to a shrinking, monochrome base of conservative supporters, is pushing unpopular policies and the toxicity of division and distraction. Republican Party losses in state and federal races will embarrass the President and mark the rejection of Trumpism. Loss of the House and/or the Senate would spell \"game over\" for the Republicans, a check on a president unable to thwart the Mueller investigation or stop Congressional hearings on corruption and collusion by his administration.\n\nFor more opinion...

Rick Scott in Florida, Trump called the citizenship clause of the Constitution a \" crazy policy ,\" and told the crowd that \"illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" During the rally, the crowd shouted \"USA!\" and \"CNN sucks!\" and directed its anger towards Gillum with chants of, \" Lock him up !\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl subdirector de vida silvestre del zool\u00f3gico, Aminu Muhammed, neg\u00f3 la afirmaci\u00f3n de Sawyerr de que el camello estaba desnutrido\n\nUn zool\u00f3gico en Nigeria est\u00e1 acusado de crueldad animal despu\u00e9s de que apareciera en l\u00ednea una foto de un camello de aspecto fr\u00e1gil\n\n(CNN) - \u00bfPodr\u00eda este camello estar enfermo o desnutrido?\n\nUn zool\u00f3gico en Nigeria est\u00e1 acusado de crueldad animal despu\u00e9s de que apareciera en l\u00ednea una foto de un camello de aspecto fr\u00e1gil.\n\n\n\nTunde Sawyerr, dijo que estaba visitando el Parque Nacional para Ni\u00f1os y el Zool\u00f3gico en la ciudad capital de Abuja cuando vio al animal.\n\n\"Antes de poner animales en un lugar, hay ciertas cosas que hacer.

The gubernatorial race is similarly divided: 49% for Democrat Andrew Gillum and 48% for Republican Ron DeSantis. In both contests, the share of likely voters who say they could change their minds in the final days of the campaign stands in single digits.\n\nThe results reflect tighter contests than CNN's last poll in the state, which found both Democrats with an advantage. An average of other recent polling on each of the Florida races suggests a narrow Democratic tilt. A CNN poll of polls average assessing five recent live-interviewer telephone polls of the race -- including the new one from CNN -- finds Nelson topping Scott 48% to 45%, while Gillum edges DeSantis 49% to 45%.\n\nIn the new CNN poll, the decline in support for Gillum comes across demographic groups, but is sharpest among non-white voters (Gillum drops nine points among that group), those without college degrees (down seven points) and women (down six).\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) Big Tech executives could face jail time in the aftermath of hacks or privacy abuses if a senator has his way.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, released a draft bill Thursday that would give the Federal Trade Commission the ability to place harsher penalties on tech companies that violate users' privacy.\n\nThe bill is titled the Consumer Data Protection Act.

he'll take it.\n\nAfter months of legal drama, the terminally ill cancer patient has agreed to a reduced award of about $78 million from the agrochemical giant Monsanto, a sharp decrease from a jury's $289 million verdict.\n\nStill, Monsanto's parent company says it will appeal.\n\nJohnson, a former school groundskeeper, won a monumental case against Monsanto, claiming the company's famous weed killer Roundup gave him terminal cancer.\n\nIn August, a San Francisco jury awarded Johnson $250 million in punitive damages -- to punish Monsanto -- and about $39 million in compensatory damages -- for Johnson's lost income, pain and suffering.\n\nJohnson's doctor said he had lesions over 80% of his body. Monsanto said there's no evidence Roundup causes cancer.\n\nThe judge then left the ball in Johnson's court. If he accepted the reduced award, Bolanos would not order a new trial . If he rejected it, a new trial over punitive damages would be ordered.\n\nJohnson's attorneys told the court Friday he \"will accept the reduction of punitive damages to the amount of $39,253,209.35\" in order \"to avoid the further burden of a new trial or appeal.\"\n\nBut if Monsanto appeals the judge's reduced punitive damages award, Johnson will continue to fight, his lawyers wrote.\n\nThousands of cases hang in the balance\n\nAcross the country, cancer patients suing Monsanto are carefully monitoring Johnson's case because it could set a precedent for more than 4,000 similar cases awaiting trial.\n\nJohnson was the first cancer patient to take Monsanto to court because in California, dying plaintiffs can be granted expedited trials\n\nSlashing Johnson's total award -- from $289 million to $78 million -- could be a setback for similar plaintiffs, University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said. But Johnson's triumphant verdict could also help other plaintiffs.\n\nWhile the judge's ruling \"may take the wind out of their sails,\" he said, \"Johnson may also provide a road map for the 4,000 other cases on liability and allow some plaintiffs to win.\"\n\nBayer, the company that recently acquired Monsanto, had a mixed reaction to the decrease in punitive damages.\n\n\"The court's decision to reduce the punitive damage award by more than $200 million is a step in the right direction, but we continue to believe that the liability verdict and damage awards are not supported by the evidence at trial or the law and plan to file an appeal with the California Court of Appeal,\" Bayer said.\n\nThe company said hundreds of studies have shown glyphosate, the key ingredient in Roundup, is safe when used as directed.\n\n\"Glyphosate-based herbicides have been used safely and successfully for over four decades,\" Bayer said.", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has told advisers that Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, is his leading choice to become US ambassador to the United Nations and he could offer the post as soon as this week, two sources familiar with his pick told CNN.\n\nIf named Nauert, who met with Trump Monday, would leave her role at the State Department to take over from Nikki Haley, who surprised White House officials last month when she announced her decision to step down at the end of the year.\n\nPeople close to the President cautioned that his pick is not final until it is formally announced. The White House declined to comment on the matter. Nauert has been keeping a low profile this week after meeting with Trump on Monday. Two of her daily briefings have been conducted by her deputy.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Thursday, Trump confirmed that Nauert is \"under very serious consideration\" to become the next US ambassador to the UN.\n\n\"She's excellent. She's been with us a long time. She's been a supporter for a long time. And she's really excellent,\" Trump said.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) The Justice Department has announced multiple charges against two ex-Goldman Sachs bankers linked to Malaysia's state investment fund scandal.\n\nThe agency said Thursday that Tim Leissner, former Southeast Asia chairman, conspired to launder money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by paying bribes to government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi.\n\nLeissner has pleaded guilty and will forfeit $43.7 million.\n\nThe Justice Department also unsealed an indictment against Roger Ng, a former Goldman Sachs banker, and Malaysian financier Jho Low, who allegedly played a central role in the scheme to launder billions of dollars from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund.\n\nThe US government says Ng and Low also paid bribes to foreign officials.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a freshman lawmaker from Wyoming, is running for the role of Republican Conference chair in House GOP leadership, a source close to Cheney confirmed to CNN.\n\nIf Cheney wins, it would make her a rising star in the Republican Party and the run for leadership puts the first-term lawmaker on a path to gain more prominence on Capitol Hill. GOP leadership encouraged her to run for the position, a Republican source with knowledge told CNN.\n\nCheney has been all over the country fundraising for Republican candidates ahead of Election Day and has been an active fundraiser for members of her party since she came into office. The 2018 midterm elections, where House Republicans are at risk of losing their majority in Congress, take place next week.\n\nUS Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming speaks during a news conference in February on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nCheney will be out fundraising on Thursday and Friday with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a top Republican leader, in an effort to bolster eight different congressional races. Cheney will return to her home state of Wyoming for Election Day.\n\nIf the GOP holds the House in next week's elections and Cheney becomes House GOP Conference chair that would make her No. 4 in House Republican leadership. The position is considered critical for party communications and media strategy. If Republicans lose the House, the GOP conference chair would be No. 3 in Republican leadership, as Democrats would take over the speakership.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday claimed he would sign an executive order \"next week\" aimed at restricting US asylum rules, as he seeks to use a group of Central American migrants heading for the US border as part of his midterm election closing argument.\n\nHe also suggested that the US troops he dispatched to the US-Mexico border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones at them.\n\nIn a meandering speech at the White House about immigration, Trump recycled many of the talking points he touts on the campaign trail -- but offered little in the way of concrete ways to address the problems he embellished.\n\nTrump said his administration is finalizing an executive action that would limit asylum claims to legal ports of entry, claiming migrants frequently abuse the system by fabricating their need for asylum.\n\nBut he declined to specify how a change he described as a forthcoming executive order would work, or why he was convening a presidential address for a policy shift that is still in the preliminary stages.\n\nAsked if he envisions US troops firing on anyone in the groups of migrants, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"I hope not. I hope not -- but it's the military.\"\n\n\"I hope there won't be that,\" Trump said, but added that anybody throwing rocks or stones at the military service members will be considered to be using a firearm, \"because there's not much difference when you get hit in the face with a rock.\"\n\nPentagon regulations only justify deadly force in face of threat\n\nA US defense official told CNN that the troops deployed to the border will be operating under the standard rules on the use of force and will only use such force in self-defense.\n\nOfficial Department of Defense regulations say \"deadly force is justified only when there is a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to a person.\"\n\nLt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said following Trump's remarks that the Defense Department \"will not discuss hypothetical situations or specific measures within our rules on the use of force, but our forces are trained professionals who always have the inherent right of self-defense.\"\n\n\"I would also emphasize that our forces are in support of DHS/CBP, who are performing law enforcement activities,\" Davis said.\n\nDefense officials have repeatedly emphasized the troops at the border are there to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants.\n\nThe top general overseeing US Northern Command said on Tuesday that \"CBP (Customs and Border Protection) personnel are ... absolutely the primary and principal members that will be handling, specifically, the migrants.\"\n\n\"There could be incidental interaction between our military members and migrants or other personnel that might be in that area. And so we are making that our soldiers, our Marines are going to be fully trained in how to do that interaction,\" Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy said.\n\nThe general added, \"They're going to understand the rules for that interaction, and they'll be consistent with CBP.\"\n\nRemarks come ahead of midterms\n\nTrump has focused increasingly on immigration heading into the final days of the midterms , as Republicans across the country struggle to match their opponents in drumming up voter enthusiasm.\n\nTrump did not release details on the asylum proposal or how it would be implemented, saying only that he intended to sign an order sometime next week restricting asylum claims.\n\nWith three campaign rallies, a midterm election and a trip to France on the books, however, the President's schedule for next week is already crowded.\n\nThe President said he would sign an immigration-related executive order next week, but was not specific as to what it would address.\n\nA White House aide had said earlier Thursday that Trump would unveil an executive action requiring migrants to request asylum at legal points of entry and preventing them from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border illegally. Although the President referenced such a policy in his speech, he offered no defense of how such a plan, once finalized, could be legal, given laws presently allowing migrants the right to claim asylum once they are on American soil.\n\nThe Trump administration has been looking at ways to limit the number of asylum seekers, with the President and his allies often describing asylum as a \"loophole.\"\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives in the US \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival\" may apply for asylum if he or she has a \"well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said victims of gang and domestic violence no longer qualify for asylum.\n\n\"Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even all serious problems, that people face every day all over the world,\" he said in June.\n\nAs attorney general, Sessions has broad power over asylum procedures and the immigration courts, which are under the auspices of the Justice Department.\n\nHe has also suggested that those claims should be rejected even before asylum seekers appear before a judge and begin court proceedings and that the simple fact of crossing the border illegally could also be a factor in rejecting an asylum claim.\n\nCNN reported earlier this week that the administration is also considering a plan to limit the number of migrants able to enter at legal ports of entry by \"metering,\" essentially creating a waitlist to allow people to enter only if the Department of Homeland Security has the capacity to process and detain them at one of its facilities, a department official said.\n\nIn the past, the practice of metering has resulted in individuals deciding not to endure a lengthy wait to try to get into the country legally and instead to cross illegally. Should some of this group of migrants do the latter, they could face a tougher and higher standard for seeking asylum under the administration's plans.\n\nWhite House aides had considered having Trump deliver an immigration speech earlier in the week, but the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre on Saturday delayed those plans.", "(CNN) Former England soccer star Rio Ferdinand has announced his engagement to reality-television star Kate Wright, three years after the death of his first wife.\n\nThe couple shared images taken atop Nation Towers in Abu Dhabi after Ferdinand proposed, with his three children looking on.\n\n\"The perfect end to our holiday ...

Es como intentar clavar gelatina en la pared\u201d.\n\nD\u00e9cadas despu\u00e9s de ese discurso, el comentario de la gelatina de Clinton se volvi\u00f3 un poco una broma oscura entre los defensores de la libertad en internet, mientras China sigue construyendo el Gran Cortafuegos, el sistema de control y vigilancia de la web m\u00e1s sofisticado del mundo.\n\nUn nuevo reporte publicado esta semana muestra que China es de lejos el censor m\u00e1s efectivo de Internet, y lejos de retirarse, est\u00e1 exportando su modelo a todo el mundo.\n\nBeijing constantemente ha desafiado todas las predicciones confiables (incluso hechas por personas con mucho m\u00e1s conocimiento sobre Internet que Clinton) de que esto ser\u00eda imposible. Los censores de China reinan en blogs, redes sociales y gigantes de b\u00fasqueda estadounidense, y repetidamente derrotan u obstaculizan cualquier intento por socavar el Firewall, de redes virtuales privadas (conocidas como VPN) de la dark web.\n\nSunday Yokubaitis, presidente ejecutivo de la compa\u00f1\u00eda de VPN Golden Frog, le dijo a CNN que ellos han \u201csido testigos de un aumento masivo\u201d de intentos de bloquear sus servidores en China.\n\n\u201cSol\u00edamos ver bloqueos aproximadamente una vez cada seis semanas; ahora est\u00e1n tratando de bloquear nuestro servicios varias veces por d\u00eda\u201d, dijo \u00e9l.\n\nComo lo document\u00e9 en mi libro \u201cThe Great Firewall of China: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet\u201d, el modelo de Beijing del Internet ahora se est\u00e1 expandiendo m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de sus fronteras, con los sensores de China trabajando efectivamente con sus hom\u00f3logos en Rusia, Uganda y una gran cantidad de pa\u00edses para construir controles de internet y acabar con la disidencia en l\u00ednea.\n\nUn nuevo reporte de Freedom House \u2014una ONG financiada por el gobierno de Estados Unidos\u2014 apoya esto.

But most employee resource groups (or ERGs) share a common purpose: to bring employees together.\n\nCompanies have ERGs for a variety of different identities: what you do at work (groups for managers), what you do outside of work (groups for parents and caregivers) or how you see yourself (groups for women, Christians, Latinx employees, etc.).\n\n\"You're there because you're connected in some way, because you have a common belief or background,\" says Lacey McLaughlin, CEO and cofounder of Flerish, a leadership development tool. \"When they come together, role no longer matters.\"\n\nERGs aren't just good for the employees, McLaughlin says, they're great for the company, too.\n\nThese groups can act as a powerful tool to promote diversity in the company. Plus, they often connect lower level employees to decision makers in the C-suite, giving voice to employees with ideas that may otherwise not been heard.\n\nThe ERG mission\n\nWhile socializing and networking are huge parts of the ERG experience, the groups are also well-positioned to expand their influence beyond happy hours and special events. ERGs can also push huge changes at the company, updating hiring policies and putting newer employees in touch with senior leaders.\n\nBut McLaughlin says there's an interesting dynamic between ERGs and firms. Some companies have great success in creating healthy, thriving ERGs, but they struggle to bring some of that energy back into the organization at large.\n\n\"Really what ERGs were in a lot of ways was a fun way to go hang out with people like you,\" McLaughlin says. \"But if it's just an opportunity for people to come together and enjoy company, that's a missed opportunity.\"\n\nERGs can also harness their power to change the organization for the better. ENABLE, an ERG for ability issues at Fidelity Investments, recently did exactly that, proposing a business case that ultimately resulted in Fidelity creating its first Office of Accessibility.\n\n\"Because we have access to thousands of associates in our ERGs, we have access to thousands of innovative ideas,\" says Amy Philbrook, head of diversity and inclusion for Fidelity Investments. \"I think it's where we leverage the ERGs as a strategic business utility versus a social club.\"\n\n'Every invitation is an open invitation'\n\nAt Salesforce, employee resource groups are known as \"ohana\" groups, after the Hawaiian term for \"chosen family.\" The groups orient around passion areas and identities, like BOLDForce, for black employees; Outforce, the LGBTQ group; and FaithForce, a community for all faiths.\n\nThe idea is that these circles create communities within the broader Salesforce workforce, and everyone is encouraged to join one, even if you're a white woman joining BOLDForce or a straight employee going to Outforce events.\n\n\"We wanted to start talking about allyship in our ohana groups,\" says Molly Q. Ford, senior director of equality at Salesforce. \"If you very candidly don't see yourself reflected back, say if you're a majority culture cisgender male, [asking] 'Where is there room for me?' So we said 'We have a job for you. You're not off the hook. Your job is to stand up and be an ally.'\"\n\nSome say ERGs focus too much on one aspect of identity. Deloitte made the decision late last year to create \"inclusion councils\" to work alongside ERGs, partly for that reason.\n\n\"In addition to the support and connectivity our people receive from [ERGs], we are also moving beyond the confinements of a single defining characteristic by creating Inclusion Councils that reflect a diverse group of people with different experiences, talents, and perspectives,\" Deloitte US CEO Cathy Engelbert wrote in a LinkedIn post . \"These councils complement our [ERGs] by focusing on solving some of the greatest needs of our people.\"\n\nIdeally, says Philbrook, these events are open to everyone, so that people feel comfortable exploring Hispanic Heritage month with the Latinx ERG, for example, or marching in the Pride Parade with the LGBTQ group.\n\n\"These aren't groups that do programming and sponsorship for and of and contained within themselves,\" she says. \"They do programming and sponsorship for everyone at the company who has an aligned interest or a curiosity and a desire to explore and expose themselves to differences. So every invitation is an open invitation.\"\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story identified Amy Philbrook as the director of human resources at Fidelity Investments. Philbrook is head of diversity and inclusion for Fidelity Investments.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Deloitte had eliminated its ERGs. Deloitte created inclusion councils to complement the existing ERGs.", "(CNN) With a stampede of last-minute race-baiting agita , President Donald Trump has diverted the national debate before the key midterm elections . These do not simply feel like dog whistles, but something closer to the President pulling a fire alarm in order to rile up his base of supporters.\n\nBut even before Trump's efforts to make 2018 about race, it was already a key issue in Georgia and Florida, where two black candidates, Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, are on the ballots in governors' races with no incumbent. There's not currently a sitting US governor who is African-American, and only two black governors have been elected in US history. Douglas Wilder served a term in Virginia from 1990 until 1994 and Deval Patrick served two terms in Massachusetts before retiring in 2015. In Maryland, former NAACP chairman Ben Jealous is the Democratic nominee, but he is not considered to be quite as competitive against the Republican incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan.\n\nCNN's Fredreka Schouten wrote a must-read about how all three candidates could benefit from a \"black wave\" if a new smattering of political action groups can get black voters to the polls.\n\nAs Democrats in those races are counting on African-Americans to turn out and vote, in Georgia the race recently has featured accusations from Abrams that her opponent, Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp, has embarked on a campaign of voter suppression by pushing laws that would purge lots of mostly black voters from the rolls . They would mostly affect people in upcoming elections, but the issue of disenfranchisement has certainly played a role in the race.\n\nBoth Trump and former President Barack Obama will appear in rallies there later this week trying to get out the vote.\n\nIt is a fact of modern American politics that Democrats rely on minority voters and Republicans rely on white voters. That doesn't mean that Democrats haven't taken black voters for granted, according to Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University.\n\nShe said the emergence of three black general election candidates in state-wide races along with the rise of a more progressive agenda among Democrats could signal a shift.\n\n\"The Democratic Party is having its own internal reckoning about its own reticence about promoting its own candidates of color,\" she said, citing a previous \"perception that they might not have cross-racial appeal in statewide races.\"\n\nThis year, Gillespie said high-profile candidates of color like Abrams and Gillum are showing they can be just as competitive in statewide races.\n\nSo much of American politics these days has so much to do with race. Ronald Brownstein has documented repeatedly how Trump's core of support is largely white, rural and less educated . Whereas Democrats have grown in urban areas, appealing to more diverse blocs of voters and educated whites.\n\nRepublicans, according to Gillespie, tend to gear their policy platforms toward the individual and have generally rejected the idea of identity politics -- even though it's very clearly a game Trump is not-so-subtly playing.\n\n\"The Republican Party has rejected the notion of group identity, and they reject that notion of identity politics, claiming that's what Democrats play. We have to recognize, though, that identities matter and groups matter\u2014even to whites, and even to Republicans,\" she said.\n\nBlack voters since the civil rights era have largely sided with Democrats.\n\nBut Gillespie said both parties have failed to really energize minority voters.\n\nWhich could be part of what's behind a mystery of recent US politics: Why Latinos have not turned on Trump despite his anti-immigrant rhetoric. He did better among Latinos in 2016 than either Mitt Romney in 2012 or John McCain in 2008. Texas, for instance, is a majority-minority state , but still seems out of reach for Democrats, although Rep. Beto O'Rourke represents their best recent chance to change that. Gillespie argued that has a lot to do with both parties failing to effectively campaign in these communities.\n\nThat the constitutional amendment Trump pledged to undo -- which would stop people at the border from having US citizen children in the US -- was passed as a bandage during Reconstruction to guarantee no former freed slaves were denied citizenship is apparently lost on the President. It's also proof that race is an essential part of the immigration debate.\n\nIn Florida, another majority-minority state, race has also turned into a key issue after despicable racist robo-calls mocked Gillum\n\nGillum fired off at his Republican opponent former Rep. Ron DeSantis during a debate that, \"Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist,\" Gillum said.\n\nDeSantis condemned the robo-calls, but he has also spoken at conferences hosted by David Horowitz, an anti-Muslim conservative political activist.\n\nTrump weighed not so subtly into the fray Monday when he tweeted to his supporters to vote in Florida's gubernatorial election, and he pointed out that one candidate went to Harvard/Yale and said the other was a thief\n\nThat the well-pedigreed candidate of his troubled analogy is white and the \"thief\" candidate is black could very well be a coincidence.\n\nThere's a reason the word \"nationalist\" makes so many people uncomfortable. Hitler was a nationalist. Many strong-men through history have been nationalists. Now the US President is calling himself a nationalist, and he's not ashamed of it.\n\nHe's not, mind you, calling himself a racial nationalist, as the white nationalists do. But the motivating issue of his presidency is keeping new people -- Muslims or Mexicans and Central Americans -- out of the US through a travel ban, a wall or by dispatching the military. He's groused loudly that getting rid of Confederate statues is \"changing the culture\" of the US.\n\nEncouraging nationalism and defending the culture, as he defines it, are key elements of Trump's slogan/mantra to \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThat means it's impossible for a lot of people to separate nationalism from white nationalism. Trump said he had no idea the two could be linked when asked about it by CNN's Jim Acosta.\n\n\"There is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white nationalist,\" Acosta said.\n\n\"I've never even heard that,\" said Trump, despite the fact that it had dominated news coverage after he embraced the term. \"I cannot imagine that.\"\n\nBut it's also essential to point out that in Trump's America, nationalism is encouraged. There are many kinds of nationalism. Nationalists are good and \"globalists,\" as he calls them, are bad. A lot of people consider that word -- \"globalist\" -- to be anti-Semitic, by the way\n\nGillespie said one thing we will learn from the Trump era is what price, if any, Republicans ultimately pay for Trump's words.\n\n\"Before Trump, we thought that politicians who openly talked about race in inflammatory ways did so at their peril,\" she said, arguing this is part of why he was not taken seriously in 2015, when he called Mexicans rapists to begin his campaign\n\n\"Everyone thought voters weren't going to endorse that kind of openly racist language. And then they did.\"", "(CNN) When the man charged with killing 11 people Saturday at a Pittsburgh synagogue arrived with injuries at Allegheny General Hospital, the staff -- some of whom are Jewish -- stepped up and did their jobs, even as he continued to spew hate, their boss said.\n\n\"Isn't it ironic that somebody who's yelling in the ambulance and the hospital, 'I want to kill all the Jews,' is taken care of by a Jewish nurse, and there's a Jewish hospital president that comes in to check on him afterwards,\" Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, the facility's top administrator, told CNN's Alex Marquardt a day after the massacre.\n\nCohen is a member of the Tree of Life synagogue, where the shooting unfolded. He lives nearby and even heard the shootout between police and Robert Bowers, who pleaded not guilty Thursday to 44 federal charges, including 32 that may be punishable by death.\n\nCohen this week has praised the professionalism that his staff showed in treating Bowers, 46, who had a history of posting anti-Semitic rhetoric online and told police Jews were \"committing genocide to my people,\" according to an FBI affidavit.\n\n'To us, they're patients'\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Russian investigators probing the failed launch of a Soyuz rocket transporting a crew to the International Space Station last month said damage to a sensor during the rocket's assembly led to the malfunction that forced an emergency landing.\n\nOleg Skorobogatov, the head of the commission probing the failure, announced the findings at a news conference Thursday in the Moscow region. He said the \"abnormal separation\" of the booster could be attributed to damage to the sensor. This caused the failure of a lid opening to an oxidizer tank's nozzle cover.\n\n\"The launch ended ... due to the abnormal separation of one of the side blocks (block D) that hit the central block (block A ) in the fuel tank, which led to its depressurization and, consequently, to the loss of stabilization of the space rocket,\" Skorobogatov told reporters.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Soyuz rocket launch The Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft carrying US astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin of Russia blasts off from the launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on Thursday, October 11.

It was at least the fifth time in three days that children were hurt or worse at a bus stop.\n\nThe other crashes occurred in Mississippi, Indiana and a second Florida city; in another Thursday incident, a second-grader was found dead on the side of the road by his house after being run over by a vehicle traveling at a slow speed.\n\nIn the Tampa crash, witnesses said a Ford Escort driving at a high rate of speed in a residential area hit several pedestrians on the side of the street, Tampa police spokesman Eddy Durkin said. Police later said it was unclear whether the driver was speeding.\n\nImages from the scene show backpacks scattered on the shoulder.\n\nTwo adults and five children -- two with serious injuries were taken to hospitals, Durkin said. One child is in critical condition. None of the injuries are considered life-threatening, he said. Three of the children are 6 years old, one in 9 and the eldest is 12.", "\u0647\u062f\u064a\u0644 \u063a\u0628\u0648\u0646\n\n\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646

Ticketmaster and others a run for their money.\n\nIt is perhaps best known for creating an affordable ticket sales platform for organizers of small events and venues \u2014 everything from chocolate festivals to jobs fairs, marathons to marches and fundraisers to campaign rallies.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company was cofounded a dozen years ago by Julia Hartz, along with her husband and board chairman, Kevin Hartz, and Renaud Visage, who was Eventbrite's first chief technology officer.\n\nAfter years overseeing marketing and management of the company, Hartz took over as CEO from her husband in 2016.\n\nShe was named by Fortune in 2013 as one of the most powerful women entrepreneurs, and she eventually became just one of 15 women who founded billion-dollar startups.\n\nIn September, Eventbrite ( EB ) went public, and its market cap is now approaching $2 billion.\n\nThe company's reach is global. With 14 offices in 11 countries, it issued more than 200 million tickets to events worldwide last year, and served more than 700,000 event organizers.\n\nBefore taking Eventbrite public, CEO Julia Hartz was one of just 15 women founders of billion-dollar startups.\n\nCNN asked Hartz in an email interview to share what's made Eventbrite so successful, her best advice for couples who want to go into business together and anyone who wants to follow in her footsteps. She also weighs in on the value of sleep and the importance of hiring people different from you.\n\nWhat does it take to run a successful business?\n\nA laser focus on your core customer. Our business succeeds when our event creators succeed. And the only way to help our creators succeed is by putting ourselves in their shoes so we can truly understand their unique needs.\n\nAlso, having the right team in place is critical. Some of my proudest moments in building this company, which is now more than 1,000 global employees strong across 11 countries, have been bringing on the people who I know will help us pull the future in faster.\n\nHow do you keep innovating and stay on top of trends in such a fast-paced business world?\n\nBy thinking big and focusing on the long-term opportunity. Try and anticipate what the needs of the world will be in five to 10 years, and build for that. Harnessing the power of technology to make it possible for anyone to create a movement, or an event or live experience around any topic, passion, curiosity or cause is what motivated us 12 years ago when we started Eventbrite, and it's so gratifying that this is what continues to drive us today.\n\nGreat ideas are born from curiosity and it's that strong desire to go all in and get the most out of experiences that motivates us at Eventbrite. We're not afraid to take risks (smart ones) and learn from our failures.\n\nWhat's your best advice to couples who want to go into business together?\n\nFirst, make sure you're aligned on what you want to create. When we started Eventbrite, we didn't just want to build a business together \u2014 we wanted to create a company that stood the test of time.\n\n[A]nticipate what the needs of the world will be in five to 10 years, and build for that.\" Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz\n\nSecond, make contingency plans. There should be a plan that allows for both the relationship and the company to not only survive, but thrive.\n\nLast, but definitely not least: Divide and conquer! You should have complementary skills that enable you to cover different parts of the business, which allows for clear areas of ownership and responsibility.\n\nWhat advice would you give someone with your job (or who wants to be in your job)?\n\nIdentify your \"superpower\" and figure out how to leverage it to build operational muscle. Leading Eventbrite has taught me a lot about how to connect with people to drive results. Energy is my \"operating system.\" I can quickly read the energy in a room and understand where people are coming from, which allows me to adapt and be authentic with them, while also driving the right outcomes for the business. I call empathy my superpower, but it was only after learning to apply discipline to my empathy that it became a strength. I had to learn to stay neutral, versus reacting to everything that was coming my way.\n\nWhat do you wish you'd learned early in your career?\n\nI was fortunate to actually realize this pretty early on, but one of my biggest lessons was to not hire people exactly like me. The chemistry of a leadership team is incredibly important, but that doesn't mean you all need to think and act the same. We've achieved success by leveraging complementary skill sets and diverse opinions.\n\nWhat mentor or teacher has influenced your career most, and how?\n\nWithout a doubt, my cofounder and husband, Kevin Hartz. He was unflappable in his optimism when we were starting Eventbrite, and that was contagious and influential. It was this inspiration and also our complementary skill sets that got us to this place today.\n\nThere were millions of reasons why we shouldn't have succeeded but instead today, our platform powers millions of events for more than 700,000 creators around the globe.\n\nHow many hours a night do you typically sleep?\n\nI'm a big believer in the importance of getting enough sleep \u2014 especially during the busiest of times. Getting a solid eight hours of sleep a night not only allows me to sustain energy, de-stress faster, and think more clearly, but helps keep me from getting sick. I believe it's the only known and effective true human superpower.\n\nWhat's your favorite podcast?", "Washington (CNN) Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum said Thursday that President Donald Trump has provided \"cover\" to people who are racist and has contributed to the degradation in the nation's political discourse.\n\n\"I have not called the President a racist, but there are racists in his sympathizers who believe he may be, which is why they go to his aid, which is why he has provided them cover. I believe his cover has led to much of the degradation in our political discourse,\" Gillum told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" Thursday.\n\nOn Monday, Trump posted on Twitter that there is a choice in Florida \"between a Harvard/Yale educated man\" -- referring to the GOP candidate Rep. Ron DeSantis -- and a \"thief,\" referring to Gillum, for governor. Critics decried Trump's attack as a racist dog-whistle.\n\nDeSantis has seized on Gillum's 2016 decision to accept a ticket to the Broadway show \"Hamilton\" from a group that included an undercover FBI agent, according to text and email records released under subpoena last week, as evidence that an ongoing federal corruption probe in Tallahassee is closer to the mayor than had been previously reported.\n\nThe corruption probe centered on whether developers successfully influenced city projects. No one has been charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nRead More", "Halie Soifer serves as executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, an advocacy organization founded in 2017, which aims to help Democrats win control of the House, Senate and Oval Office in future elections by mobilizing the Jewish vote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Words cannot express the horror, grief and outrage experienced by the Jewish community after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. As funerals began for the 11 lives tragically lost in what is believed to be the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history, President Trump insisted on visiting Pittsburgh against the wishes of local elected officials and many in the Jewish community.\n\nTrump's visit to the synagogue was unwelcome because of a stark and undeniable reality -- Donald Trump did not pull the trigger in Pittsburgh, but Donald Trump is to blame for helping spread the hate that fills the hearts of those who commit such egregious acts of violence.\n\nJust look at the events of the past week. On Friday, we learned that Cesar Sayoc is accused of sending explosive devices to at least a dozen high-profile Democrats whom Trump had repeatedly vilified. The day after Sayoc was arrested, Robert Bowers was accused of initiating a killing spree at the synagogue in Pittsburgh. According to a criminal complaint, Bowers told authorities he wanted all Jews to die, and had posted on social media that the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society brings \"...invaders in that kill our people,\" referring to refugees. Bowers and Sayoc were both seemingly motivated by the culture of violence and hatred that Trump seems to thrive within and promote.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the synagogue massacre, President Trump publicly repeated dog whistles used by anti-Semites. From the White House, Trump attacked \"globalists\" -- a classic anti-Semitic trope -- and laughed at the suggestion of jailing George Soros, a frequent Jewish target of Trump and anti-Semites.\n\nThis came on the heels of Trump's declaration last week that he is a \"nationalist,\" which has been used in association with two infamous movements -- Nazism and white supremacy. To top it off, after indicating he was told to avoid such terminology, Trump defiantly instructed his supporters: \"Use that word. Use that word.\" Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke immediately took to Twitter to embrace Trump for defending the views of the KKK.\n\nTrump's rhetoric matters. He is the President of the United States and he has -- at best -- been grossly irresponsible and utterly reckless with his words. At worst, he has inspired violence targeting minority groups in a manner reminiscent of the darkest moments in history. Whether Donald Trump himself is an anti-Semite, racist, neo-Nazi or white supremacist is almost irrelevant. Those who align with these movements feel legitimized and emboldened by him. Even if Trump is willfully ignorant as to origins of his incendiary language, anti-Semites hear his message loud and clear, and believe he is their champion and ally.\n\nIt is no coincidence that in 2017 anti-Semitic incidents in America surged nearly 60%, the largest single-year increase since the Anti-Defamation League began keeping records in 1979. Since his election, President Trump has stoked hatred of racial and religious minorities, cultivated fear of immigrants and refugees, and lied about alleged threats on our borders. He has been silent or equivocated in the face of blatant anti-Semitism, such as that witnessed by the neo-Nazis chanting \"Jews will not replace us\" in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nAnd he has repeated false conspiracy theories about immigrants and Jews that have exacerbated xenophobia. From his campaign to build a wall on the Mexican border, to his Muslim ban, to his most recent description of a caravan of asylum-seekers headed to the United States as a \"national emergency,\" Donald Trump has lit a match and fueled a fire of racism and anti-Semitism, exploiting fear for his own perceived political gain.\n\nJUST WATCHED Protesters denounce Trump's Pittsburgh visit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Protesters denounce Trump's Pittsburgh visit 03:11\n\nTrump is responsible for the consequences of his words, just as Republicans in Congress are responsible when they fail to speak out against them. The silence of most Republicans in the face of Trump's abhorrent behavior has been deafening, as they have abdicated their responsibility to put country above party. To make matters worse, some Republicans -- such as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy -- have started to mimic Trump's repugnant behavior.\n\nMcCarthy tweeted, and later deleted, false allegations of well-known Jewish Democrats buying elections, as an unprecedented number of neo-Nazis and white supremacists are running for office this election cycle, all as Republicans. In the age of Trump, anti-Semites and racists see the Republican Party as their home. Any Republican who does not see that their party has been hijacked by anti-Semitism, racism, Islamophobia and hatred is blind to reality.\n\nDonald Trump is not up for re-election in 2018, but Republicans who have enabled his agenda are on the ballot, and in less than one week we go to the polls in one of the most important elections in history. Americans who are fed up with right-wing violence can reject hatred and bigotry by electing a Democratic majority.

Uber's drivers are independent contractors so they do not receive benefits such as health care or tuition reimbursement.\n\nStarting Thursday in seven cities and all of New Jersey, drivers will earn points for the rides they give to qualify for four tiers of status. They'll also need a 4.85 rating and a cancellation rate of less than 4% to achieve either partner, gold, platinum or diamond status. The more rides a driver gives, the higher they rank.\n\nDrivers in the top two tiers will receive a 3% or 6% pay boost depending on if they have platinum or diamond status. They'll also get tuition coverage at Arizona State University's online program. Tuition coverage can be passed onto a family member, too.

It could be what they ate or what they drank. It could be something that they've breathed in. I don't know,\" Buzyn told French TV station BFM TV\n\nPesticides are suspected to be to blame for the deformities, with the particular products likely to no longer be on the market, Emmanuelle Amar, director of Remera, wrote in an email. She added that this is based solely on assumptions for now.\n\n\"These cases occurred at a given time and then they stopped occurring,\" she said. \"Either that the product used is no longer being used, or that the person or entity that was spreading it has now stopped spreading it.\"\n\nThe French health agency said that at this point, there is nothing that points toward a common cause.\n\nThe first step will be to evaluate, among the 11 suspected cases, those that correspond to transverse agenesis (the failure of the limbs to fully develop) of the upper limbs, Sant\u00e9 Publique said in a statement.\n\nAll cases will then be analyzed, and teams across multiple organizations will investigate what the affected families have in common.\n\n\"This large number of cases of infants with deformities, babies who have no arms, also exists in Brittany and Loire Atlantique,\" Amar said in a statement. \"But there was only the report of those in Brittany that was taken into account by Public Health France.\"\n\nAmar said the health agency had not taken previous cases reported by the regional register into account, despite multiple appeals, previously concluding that there were not an excessive number of cases with abnormalities.\n\nIn response, the health agency said it had identified three clusters, two of which show an excessive amount of cases. \"We considered that in the Ain region there was not an excessive amount whereas Remera said there was. This is where there is a disagreement,\" it said.\n\nSant\u00e9 Publique director Fran\u00e7ois Bourdillon told French radio station RTL that there are usually 150 cases a year, but experts have questioned this figure.\n\nAmar now welcomes the nationwide investigation but wants it to be done correctly and independent of the health agency, she said.\n\nSant\u00e9 Publique will work with L'Anses, the agency that monitors the environment, to investigate these cases and meet with local mayors and the families to work out what these families have in common, Buzyn told French TV.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut Amar questions whether that will all happen. \"The families are devastated,\" she said. \"Yesterday, a doctor went to the home of one of the mothers who collapsed after listening to the Public Health Agency statement on television saying that they had contacted the families when in fact they had never called.\"\n\nSant\u00e9 Publique said Remera met with families in the Ain region, not the health agency, adding, \"we will contact the families and we will see them next Tuesday. \"\n\nIt has also called for a national foundation of registers to be set up to \"allow us to re-evaluate the number of cases and know if there is an excessive number of cases,\" the agency said.\n\nBuzyn said the first results of the investigation will be released at the end of January and the whole investigation before June.", "Washington (CNN) US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman Jr. has stage one cancer, he revealed in an interview with the Deseret News published Thursday.\n\n\"It's just stage one,\" Huntsman said. \"So we'll probably get it taken care of, and we'll be fine.\"\n\nAfter noticing small black spots on his ear and leg, Huntsman told the Deseret News that he met with doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Utah and later had the moles removed. He will need regular checkups to ensure the cancer has not spread, the paper reported.\n\nThe cancer diagnosis has deep significance for the former Utah governor. Huntsman lost his father to cancer in February, the paper reported, and the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a close personal friend, also had melanoma -- the same type of cancer as Huntsman.\n\n\"It kind of puts things in perspective,\" Huntsman said.\n\nRead More", "Update: On November 2, Roomi informed CNN Business that a round of funding it had anticipated fell through, forcing it to lay off 40 to 50 of its 63 workers. Founder Ajay Yadav said \"it took us all by surprise.\" Yadav said the company plans to continue operations and will meet with the board and investors about the best way to move forward.\n\nWhen Ajay Yadav moved to the US from India to attend college, the transition wasn't as seamless as he had hoped.\n\n\"The whole process of finding somewhere to live was very complicated, unfair and frankly painful,\" he recalls.\n\nHe was 18 and using sites like Craigslist to find rooms to rent near his university's New York City campus. \"As a student, I could only afford to rent a room from someone,\" he says.\n\nBut when he found a room in an apartment he liked, he didn't always get along with his roommate. \"I'd get all the details about the room on Craigslist, but I had no idea about the person behind the listing,\" says Yadav, who is now 30.\n\n\"There was no transparency about the person who wanted to become my roommate. They really didn't have to tell me anything about themselves on the listing.\"\n\nYadav changed apartments close to a dozen times while he pursued his degree in software engineering at the New York Institute of Technology. It was always a crapshoot. One of his roommates even disappeared with all of his belongings when he was on vacation in India.\n\nIn his first years in New York, Roomi founder Ajay Yadav had nearly a dozen different roomates.\n\nEvery time he had to move, he feared being stuck with someone he had very little in common with or just couldn't trust.\n\nYadav was convinced that he wasn't the only one having a hard time finding a good roommate.\n\nThe thought triggered an idea: What if he created a service that better matched renters with roommates based on shared interests and personalities? And what if the app could verify both the person listing a room for rent and the person seeking one?\n\nThe whole process of finding somewhere to live was very complicated, unfair and frankly painful.\" Ajay Yadav, Roomi's founder\n\nIn 2013, Yadav got to work, bootstrapping the effort with his own savings. \"I was essentially a one-person operation,\" he said.\n\nYadav gathered apartment listings by reaching out to people directly using Twitter and online classified ads. He would then compile them on an Excel spreadsheet and post them on Tumblr. Pretty soon he was racking up dozens of users.\n\nEventually, he wrote the code for an app, first for Apple's iOS operating system and then for Android devices. After testing the app for two years, he officially launched Roomi in June 2015.\n\nA safer experience\n\nOne of Yadav's toughest challenges was figuring out how to provide a better and safer roommate finding experience.\n\n\"No decision is more important than where we live and who we live with. We want to help make this decision safe for everyone,\" he says.\n\nAll room listings on the site are carefully vetted. \"We have a 24/7 staff of 10 people committed to this process,\" said Yadav.\n\nFor those listings that raise a red flag, Roomi will request a copy of the lease, utility bill or a piece of mail addressed to the person listing the room in order to confirm their residency.\n\nEach person who lists a room for rent on Roomi also has to provide two clear photos of the bedroom and the shared living space, a photo of themselves, and a brief description about the space.\n\nCurrently, 20% of rooms submitted for rent are rejected by the platform because a lister did not meet submission guidelines for the room or, less frequently, because the person was identified as a \"scammer.\"\n\nYadav said Roomi will also suspend a user for fraudulently using the platform.\n\nThe lister also answers a series of questions about themselves and their roommate preferences.\n\nSimilarly, renters fill out a questionnaire when they first sign up. They're asked if they are smokers, early risers or night owls and how they feel about cleanliness, pets and guests. Roomi confirms their identity through a social media site such as Facebook or LinkedIn.\n\nUpon request, Roomi will also use a third-party agency for optional background checks to make sure its users \u2014 both those listing the rooms and prospective roommates \u2014 don't have a criminal record. Currently, about 40% of Roomi's US users have undergone background checks.\n\nIf a background check is successful, the platform marks the user as \"verified.\" That badge provides an added layer of confidence over those without the badge, said Yadav.\n\nUsers can learn more about one another using Roomi's direct messaging feature, which allows them to share contact information and other details.\n\nNearly half a million rooms and counting...\n\nIn three years, Roomi has grown to 2.4 million users who are predominantly young professionals and college students in their 20s. The service lists 460,000 rooms across 20 cities worldwide, including London, Barcelona and Mexico.\n\n\"My mission with Roomi is to grow our verified community and make sure that nothing bad happens to our users,\" he says.\n\nNearly 80% of room listings on Roomi have been verified and approved.\n\nWith his attention fully on Roomi, Yadav dropped out of college in 2013 and never went back.\n\nHe has scored a total of $17 million in funding from investors that include Atami Capital and Great Oaks Venture Capital. \"In the beginning, I knew nothing about raising money,\" says Yadav. \"I must have met 300 people along the way and all rejected me. I kept going until I got that first check for $10,000.\"\n\nToday, the New York-based startup has 60 employees and offices in Mexico, India and Spain.\n\nRoomi now brings in \"several million\" in annual revenue through partnerships with landlords and other real estate companies. Yadav said the business is growing sales by 20% month-over-month, but isn't profitable yet because it continues to invest heavily in improving the platform. Last year, for example, Roomi launched an in-house service called \"RoomiPay,\" which lets users set up a one-time or recurring rent payment for a 3% service fee.\n\nThe company is also expanding, both in the US and abroad, through acquisitions of rival services like room.me, Symbi, TheRoomRing and Study Abroad Apartments.\n\n\"I'm now 30 years old and the process of finding a suitable roommate is still for the most part a journey into the 'Wild Wild West,'\" says Yadav. \"With rising city costs, this generation and others to come will only continue to share homes, because they can't afford to live by themselves.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl primer partido se jugar\u00e1 el mi\u00e9rcoles 7 de noviembre en la Bombonera\n\nEl encuentro marcar\u00e1 la primera ocasi\u00f3n en que dos equipos de la misma ciudad llegan a esta instancia\n\nLos memes muestran la ansiedad y hasta preocupaci\u00f3n de algunos usuarios por el partido hist\u00f3rico\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - La final de la Copa Libertadores ser\u00e1 argentina.

So did their friends, siblings Lucy and Riley Peltz.\n\n\"We found like 40 crabs,\" said one.\n\n\"We found these little clams,\" said another.\n\n\"We saw a bunch of horses.\"\n\nFeral horses on Cumberland Island Katia Hetter/CNN\n\nAnd the list went on and on, as the four kids recounted their adventures animal spotting, biking, swimming and hiking all over the island during their six-day camping trip with their parents.\n\nThe Dunnuck and Peltz families of Asheville, North Carolina, reserved their campsites months before they traveled to Cumberland Island National Seashore , which features a barrier island off the coast of Georgia.\n\nThe families have camped on the island for several years, so they know to reserve their campsite in advance. The park's current management plan allows the park ferry to bring no more than 300 people to the island each day.\n\nThat means that ferry rides and campsites for the high seasons, which include March through April, October and holiday weekends, can sell out quickly.\n\n\"We like to hike around and explore, look for shark's teeth, have a lazy play day on the beach, do trail hikes,\" said Erin Dunnuck, Flynn and Hannah's mother. \"You always see different animals every year.\"\n\n\"Rather than see condos and gold courses, it's unique to have wilderness beside the beach,\" she said. \"That minimizes the trash and wear and tear on the island.\"\n\nAn island buffeted by nature\n\nFor the most part, those families are seeing a barrier island ruled by nature. Last year's Hurricane Irma knocked out the National Park Service pier at the mainland town of St. Marys , while Hurricane Matthew knocked out two island piers in 2016. One of those island piers was partially repaired for the park ferry to still dock there.\n\nPost-Irma last year, St. Marys and the National Park Service quickly worked out a deal to renovate the city pier for use by the park service just two months after the hurricane hit.\n\nRelated content Not even a slew of ravaging hurricanes could knock out these national park treasures\n\nWhile most of Cumberland Island became a national seashore in 1972, there are still private landowners living on the island who own their land outright. Other owners have negotiated to keep their land for a certain length of time or until they have passed away.\n\nWhile there's plenty of heated debate about the possibility of new housing being constructed on the island's privately-held land, visitors continue to visit the island. They will only see those few hundred other visitors, longtime residents and National Park Service employees and contractors.\n\nPark service staff are split between those who work with visitors, those who protect historic structures and objects, and those who work in nature, entrusted to care for species and other flora and fauna on the island.\n\nProtecting the sea turtles and more\n\nLaughing gulls Shutterstock\n\nThe group includes wildlife biologist Doug Hoffman, whose job includes protecting loggerhead sea turtles from predators.\n\n\"The island has a wide diversity of wildlife and resources to see,\" said Hoffman. \"There's a wide range of wildlife and plants, and just the different habitat types. There's over 20 vegetative communities (and) 18 plus miles of beach habitat.\"\n\nHoffman, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of the island's geological and human history, isn't just responsible for the sea loggerhead turtles, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. He's also responsible for year-round feral hog control, feral horse population monitoring, shorebird monitoring, protecting shorebird nesting, wildland fire response and facilitating scientific research projects in the park.\n\n\"We have documented over 500 plant species, over 300 bird species,\" plus 30 mammal species and 55 different types of reptiles and amphibians, said Hoffman.\n\nHoffman is often out late at night, tracking wild boar (abandoned by residents long ago when they left the island) and other predators who like to attack seat turtle nests. During nesting season from mid-April to mid-October, he supervises a crew of three to monitor the beach for nests.\n\nFriendly human visitors might spot a live sea turtle \"when they go to the beach in the morning in the summer time, or they quite possibly could see a turtle nest hatch late at night -- if they're that ambitious to go out and sit next to a nest and watch it,\" said Hoffman.\n\nHumans have lived here for centuries\n\nWhile those buildings date back to the late 1800s, there's a history of human habitation on the island that goes back thousands for years.\n\nThe island has been home to the Timucua Indians since before the Spanish colonized the island in the 16th century, followed by the British and later the United States.

After the Civil War, the Carnegies and other families bought land and built homes.\n\nAfrican-American life on the island\n\nFirst African Baptist Church Katia Hetter/CNN\n\nThe island's modest First African Baptist Church is well known for hosting the wedding of the late John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette.\n\nHowever, it's more well known in the history of Cumberland Island as the heart of the Settlement community -- the free African-American community that grew out of slavery, said Jill Hamilton-Anderson, the seashore's chief of interpretation, education and visitor services.\n\nWhere once they were forced to work the land, many of these then-free people congregated in communities around the island after the Civil War, including the community anchored by this church at the island's northern end.\n\nThe first church was established by Primus and Amanda Mitchell, who stayed on the island after they were freed.\n\n\"This was a place for worship, this was a place for education. It's what really connected the community,\" said Hamilton-Anderson.\n\nBeulah Alberty, the granddaughter of Primus and Amanda Mitchell, became \"the matriarch of this community,\" she said, noting that Alberty's home is still on site.\n\n\"She's the one who helped to build the current church we're in that was built in 1937,\" which replaced the older log cabin church built in the 1890s.\n\nNo matter where you go, it's quiet\n\nGreyfield Inn Fred Whitehead\n\nSitting in that empty church, a church where people still can get married, the quiet is impossible to ignore.\n\nWith a few hundred people on the island, the noise of human civilization mostly drops away.

Even the historic structures seem quiet, empty of the residents who once lived, worked and entertained there.\n\n\"A lot of the comments I've had from people is just the immenseness or the vastness of the forest that they see, or the lack of human related noise like automobiles or any type of industrial type noises,\" said Hoffman.\n\n\"They don't hear the typical day to day hustle and bustle that they hear when they're in civilization,\" he said. \"When they get here, all they hear is the birds singing or the wind blowing.\"\n\nIf you go: Visitors have two options if they want to stay on the island.

Last month, it raised the prices of its entire iPhone line , and this week it did the same with even more products\n\nThe smaller iPad Pro now starts at $150 more than the previous generation. The MacBook Air is $200 more, the Mac Mini is $300 more, and the Apple Pencil is $30 more.\n\n\"They're looking to differentiate and say we don't want to compete with everyone at the lower end, we want to sell something unique,\" said Wayne Lam, an analyst at IHS Markit.\n\nThere are practical reasons for the price increases. Some of the components inside the devices simply cost more to produce. Apple is also trying to cram in exciting \u2014 but pricey \u2014 new features that may or may not be necessary, such as a fingerprint sensor on a laptop.\n\nBut for the MacBook air and Mac Mini, it's also a strategic decision by Apple to try to differentiate itself in a crowded and aging PC market. Most of the computers are fairly interchangeable on the Windows side, said Lam, and many compete by lowering prices for their similar products. Apple seems to be going the other way, raising prices to more \"aspirational\" amounts and becoming a luxury brand.\n\nThe iPad Pro may have had the most surprising price change of the bunch. The new device starts at $799, but a fully tricked out 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a terabyte of storage and cellular connection costs $1,899.\n\nThat could be a sign of the future of mobile computing. Powerful tablets have the potential to replace even more laptop sales. But it is also possible tablets could lose out to the increasingly giant phones. Apple continues to make some design choices that keep the two product lines separate, such as not adding a touch screen to its laptops \u2014 but that could change down the road.\n\n\"That's an area of their product line that we don't quite know where the end game is for them, whether they're going to keep it two separate platforms,\" said Lam.\n\nFinally, there are the investors to worry about. Most people who need personal computers already own them, and Apple makes money off of the regular upgrades. To make up for any flattening or falling sales, Apple can use price increases to trade volume for revenue and make shareholders happy.", "The debate over immigration continues to grow ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.

During the few days I was on the base, it was repeatedly attacked by the Taliban, who would crawl down the hills in the shrubbery to fire through the fence.\n\nThe set for the movie is located close to the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.\n\nOn one patrol, only meters outside the base's gates, I remember seeing Taliban bullets literally landing as puffs of dust, slowly moving toward me. Fifty-two days after I filmed a report, back then for the UK's Channel Four News, the base experienced a 13-hour long, almost overwhelming attack. Seven Americans died defending the the base, and another succumbed to his injuries later.\n\nA massive internal military review was launched. Why put a base there, in the Pakistani border regions, in the first place? Who overlooked the burned-out shells of Soviet-era tanks that lined the base -- a dark message from the valley's previous occupants that things did not end well?\n\nWhy did the US seem to value a display of its reach over what its fist could actually punch that far away?\n\nIt turned out all these questions, as COP Keating (Combat Outpost Keating -- named after a soldier, Ben Keating, who died when his vehicle overturned nearby) had already been addressed. Keating was scheduled to close six days after it was attacked.\n\nCNN was on set during filming for the movie.\n\nExactly nine years later, I find myself standing in COP Keating again. Yet this time it's in Bulgaria. A short drive from Sofia, Millennium Films has painstakingly recreated the base. It is larger in scale, which at first bewilders me, and without the deadly hills -- they would have to be added later by CGI.\n\nThe tiny place that had seemed so forlorn in person now comes across as the stuff of painful legend. Orlando Bloom, Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones lead a cast that contains actual survivors from the battle: some playing themselves, others their platoon colleagues. A West Point graduate, Rod Lurie, is even directing the film.\n\nIt is more than a little jarring to see it all again. At one point, fake Taliban pop up from behind rocks and pretend to opened fire on us. It's difficult to resist the instinct to duck down.\n\nIn truth, I had put the entire COP Keating episode in a box and dropped it deep in my subconscious. You can't linger over every story you cover or you will lose yourself. And after Keating was hit, I had been told the unit we had spent time with had left before the attack.\n\nThat was wrong. Our Channel Four News report, I discovered only recently, contained some of the last pictures of some of the eight who died.\n\nThe set of the COP Keating base has been constructed in Bulgaria.\n\nThere is a scene where I ask 1st Lt. Andrew Bundermann, who led the unit in the base's defense and survived, why they are there. He says: \"We don't ask questions.\" He turns to Staff Sgt. Joshua Hardt: \"Right, Hardt? You don't ask the question why are we here?\"\n\nHardt replies: \"F**k no. We don't ask any questions, we get in trouble for asking questions.\"\n\nHardt was found dead on the base after the battle, with three bullet wounds in his skull.\n\nThe battle -- its aftermath and the errors that preceded it -- were the topic of a book by CNN's Jake Tapper, who accompanies us on the visit to the set. \"This battle happened in October 2009,\" he says, \"and here we are at the end of 2018 and I am sure the average American still has no idea how many troops we have in Afghanistan, why they are there, what they are accomplishing, what they are doing.\"\n\nHe describes writing \"The Outpost\" as the most intense work he has ever done, stemming from the obligation to get the facts right for the families of those killed.\n\nThat same sense of duty hangs over the set. In the words of producer Jonathan Yunger: \"The weight of telling this story is insane. I feel it every day\".\n\nTy Carter (left) and Caleb Landry Jones (smoking) on set in Bulgaria.\n\nScott Eastwood, who plays Clint Romesha, one of the two recipients of the Medal of Honor for his valiant acts during the fight for Keating, says: \"It's a lot of responsibility to try and make sure everything's right ... Definitely more pressure. We're still in Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe other Medal of Honor recipient, Ty Carter, who made five selflessly brave runs across the base during the battle to help others, is played by Caleb Landry Jones.\n\nThe night before, we trawled Sofia's bars with Jones and Carter, who make an odd couple, one trying still to absorb the battle he survived, and the other trying to absorb that Keating survivor.\n\nThe set of \"The Outpost\" near the Bulgarian capital.\n\nBut during the long night in Sofia, Jones doesn't mention one fact: that his brother, Staff Sgt. John Jones, lost both legs in Iraq as a Marine. The role seems intensely personal to him, further burdened by the need to get Carter right on screen. It is likely to be a startling performance.\n\n\"When I received the script,\" says Jones, \"my older brother was visiting for Thanksgiving and I asked him to read it. He read it and said 'you are doing this.' I got to meet Ty...\" he sighs. \"And now we are here. But...\" Much of what Jones says is punctuated by him rubbing his palm over his shaven head, and exhaling hard.\n\nI ask what the movie means to him. \"I don't want to talk about that ... We are halfway done, there's a lot more to do. It feels like we have shot a week even though it's really been four. It's hard to talk about it in that kind of way. I don't know if I'll understand how to answer that question [of whether their role has been hard work] maybe two years from now.\"\n\nFor Carter, who plays another soldier, but also technically advises on set to bolster authenticity, being here may be part of the recovery process. \"I got so uncomfortable when I first came on the COP or set,\" he says, \"and I think that's a good feeling. It's going to make me stronger.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED 'The Outpost' book becoming a movie, starring Eastwood Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'The Outpost' book becoming a movie, starring Eastwood 00:31\n\nThe set is a bewildering mix of Hollywood's ridiculous priorities -- the fake smoke, special chairs, walkie-talkies and trailers -- and fragments of the tiny part of an American generation that has been at war for about 17 years, and is still recovering. Two Hollywood movies will address the battle next year -- the other with Casey Affleck -- as America teaches itself a history lesson, about valor and love, from a war that's still raging, arguably at its most violent peak.\n\n\"You think, in a battle like COP Keating,\" says Tapper, \"that they'd be motivated by their hatred of the enemy, their anger. And the truth of the matter is they are motivated by the love they have for their brothers in arms. The desire to save each other. There's such a chasm between the 1% of the country who serve and the 99% who don't -- of which I am in the latter group -- there's such an inability to understand why they do what they do. But every one of the eight guys who was killed was killed in a mission of trying to help somebody else.\"\n\nThe film crew attend to an army tank on set.\n\nThe war in Afghanistan is the only part of President Trump's foreign policy he has devoted a singular and lengthy speech to -- pledging victory.\n\nYet it remains far from most America TV screens. And so, when the movie is released -- likely on the 10th anniversary of the Keating assault, October 3, 2019 -- it's likely the war will still be going on then, and that the movie becomes how many Americans learn that's the case.\n\nThe last word goes to Daniel Rodriguez, who is a Keating survivor and plays himself in the movie. \"If you think of the Vietnam-era films and the WWII films, you do them after the war has already been done. But we live in a here-and-now generation. Let's show the world how horrific it is, yet still leave our people over there at the same time.\"", "Written by CNN Staff Moscow\n\nCurator and documentary filmmaker, Olga Sviblova, is a human advertisement for Russian contemporary art, a well-known champion of both young and historic artists, and a revered personality of the art world at large.\n\nSviblova is one of Moscow's most prolific specialists in photography, as the founder and director of the Multimedia Art Museum Moscow, and she is also the maestro responsible for bringing Russian art to several world stages (she gathers under her belt at least more than 500 exhibitions, both at home and abroad).\n\nOlga Sviblova gives a tour of the city she calls home, Moscow.\n\nSviblova has been a witness to the changes in Moscow, the city where she was born and grew up to be regarded as a powerful player in the art scene. \"Moscow is full of places where life is transformed in art,\" Sviblova said in an interview.\n\nRight after college, Sviblova chose to work as a street cleaner in Moscow, and she spent seven years sweeping and being paid minimum wage, while entertaining artists in the evenings and holding impromptu art exhibitions.\n\nThis fledgling underground scene jump-started her curatorial career, which now includes the Russian pavilion at the Venice Biennale, and a role as an award-winning art documentary director.\n\nOlga Sviblova gives a tour of the city she calls home, Moscow.\n\nOver the years, Sviblova's has developed an unwavering sharp eye and love for Moscow's cinematic quality. \"Every time when I return back to Moscow, it doesn't matter if it's a sunny beautiful day, very cold weather, it's rain, and snow, I'm absolutely happy.

The toys have been strategically jumbled to create an environment for girls and boys to play together.\n\nThese two preschools in Sweden -- Nicolaigarden and Egalia (meaning 'equality' in Latin) -- go to great lengths to de-emphasize gender. Children are given the freedom to challenge and cross gender boundaries.\n\nRather than encourage children to do particular things, the teachers are careful not to box children based on their gender or subtly discourage them from doing certain things.\n\nThe school has removed the terms \"girl\" and \"boy\" completely. Instead they make a deliberate effort to call each child by their first name or the gender-neutral pronoun \"hen\".\n\nBut is it necessary to intervene at such a young age, and what are the long-term effects?\n\nChildren play in the garden of Egalia.\n\nRemoving the 'gender straitjacket'\n\nA new global study found that young girls and boys are outfitted with \"gender straitjackets\" by the age of 10 , resulting in lifelong negative consequences.\n\nThe Global Early Adolescent Study analyzed how gender is learned, enforced and reinforced among early adolescents in 15 countries.\n\nIt concluded that culturally-enforced gender stereotypes -- which are linked to an increased risk of mental and physical health problems -- are firmly rooted between the ages of 10 and 14. The study found these stereotypes leave girls at greater risk of exposure to physical and sexual violence, child marriage, and HIV. For boys, the risks can include substance abuse and suicide.\n\nIn Sweden, which is ranked as the fourth-most equal country in the world when it comes to gender, the government has made a concerted effort to emphasize equality in the Education Act.\n\nFollowing a new amendment introduced in 1998 requiring all schools to work against gender stereotyping, Lotta Rajalin set up her first gender-neutral preschool for one to five-year-olds in Stockholm's Old Town.\n\nThe gender-neutral policies at Rajalin's schools ensure that stories, songs and dramatizations are screened or re-scripted to include non-nuclear families (single parents or same-sex couples) and heroines sweeping princes off their feet.\n\nTeachers opt for non-traditional plot twists to ensure that they're not reinforcing gender stereotypes.\n\nPhotos: How students around the world are learning in new ways Bangladesh, solar-powered floating schools \u2013 All around the world, schools are reinventing education.

Similarly, they found themselves to be more likely to comfort a crying girl, while they would tell a crying boy to brush it off.\n\n\"When you change yourself and your thinking and your expectations, you will see new things and you will see that it's better for children's development,\" she says.\n\nRajalin believes gender stereotypes limit the opportunities available to a child. Her gender-neutral teaching methods stem from what she calls \"the whole life spectra\" or \"circle of opportunity.\" This circle is often divided into two semi-circles -- one for boys and one for girls.\n\nThrough gender-neutral teaching, Rajalin hopes to open up this circle of opportunities for all children to define themselves.\n\n\"We try to take away the barriers which stop both girls and boys doing what they want to do,\" she says.\n\n\"We want all children to have the same opportunities to feel, to express themselves, to like what color they like, to play the sport they're in, and so on. We don't want to limit them.\"\n\nFollowing a small, structured observation of children at one of Rajalin's preschools, Ben Kenward, a researcher in psychology at Uppsala University in Sweden and Oxford Brookes University in England, found these children had a reduced tendency to be influenced by gender stereotypes, compared to a control group of children from a typical Swedish preschool.\n\n\"The [gender neutral] pedagogy is having some of the effects that it's intended to have, and if you're committed to giving these young children the same opportunities ... then our study suggests that this kind of pedagogy is a good tool.\"\n\n'Brainwashing children'\n\nHowever, these gender-neutral policies have generated much criticism over the years.\n\nSwedish psychiatrist and author David Eberhard considers calling boys and girls \"hen\" to be \"intellectually dishonest\" as it is being \"blind to biological differences.\"\n\n\"This is the kind of brainwash that works when the kids are small and in the short run they adapt to this, but what happens when they go to normal school and they find out they were living in a sect?\" he tells CNN.\n\n\"This is a sort of a religious sect to say there's no differences between men and women, it has nothing to do with science.\"\n\nEberhard explained that he does not oppose boys choosing to play with dolls, but he draws the line at calling a girl or boy \"it\" or \"hen\".\n\nRajalin believes a lot of criticism is misguided, as people do not fully understand what they are trying to do. \"We are not trying to say girls should be boys or boys should be girls, we just want every person to have the right to be the person they are, regardless of gender,\" she says.\n\nRajalin says her gender-neutral preschools give children the same opportunities, obligations and rights, regardless of gender.\n\nHarmless 'experiment'\n\nWhile Eberhard's views are strong, he says gender-neutral schooling is unlikely to have any negative long-term effects on young children.\n\n\"I suppose that they [the children] are so sure about their identity that it doesn't matter,\" he says. \"But, as individuals, you may very well have young kids of different sexes that become very frustrated or confused.\"\n\nHe believes Sweden would be better off solving the problem of gender inequality in the real world.\n\nRajalin, however, believes adopting gender-neutral methods and exposing children to teachers of various different ethnicities, religions, sexes and sexual orientations, will better prepare them for the nuances of the real world. It will boost their self-confidence and set them up to be more successful in life, she says.\n\nPsychology professor Philip Hwang from the University of Gothenburg is not convinced. He thinks Rajalin's gender-neutral preschools are harmless but overrated.\n\n\"I don't really see any harm in it, but I think it pleases the parents more than it changes the children,\" he tells CNN.\n\nHe says he has met a couple of parents that really believe sending their children to gender-neutral preschool will have lasting effects and that they will grow up in a gender-neutral society.\n\n\"It's a statement more than something that has actual effect on children's long-term development with regard to gender issues,\" he says.\n\n\"It takes generations to change norms and values like this.\"\n\nEven Kenward, who is optimistic that the gender-neutral pedagogy is creating equal opportunities for children of both genders, is unsure what the long-term effects will be.\n\n\"It's an open question what happens to these children when they move into primary school,\" he says. \"My guess is it [gender neutral pedagogy] could continue to influence their behavior potentially, not in a very strong way necessarily. But it may have some lasting effects.\"", "(CNN) Imagine instead of viewing a shark-infested shipwreck or a space station in photos, technology meant you actually swam and floated right through them.\n\nNow, students are immersed under the water and into imaginary spacesuits to experience life as explorers and astronauts, if only for a few minutes.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) is entering classrooms around the world and taking pupils on field trips to the most inaccessible corners of the planet.\n\nAs students move their heads left and right and up and down in order to navigate an area from all angles, it's never been easier to put oneself into a virtual world that amplifies and improves the learning experience.\n\n360 degree experience\n\nAmong the applications available is Google Expeditions , which has been used by over one million students in the UK as part of their Pioneer Program , and another one million children globally.\n\n\"It's basically a personal field trip app,\" says Ben Schrom, product manager of Google Expeditions. \"It facilitates the teacher taking his or her students on a VR trip to a place or set of different places,\" he said of the app that's free to download on iOS and Android.\n\nUsers attach low-cost cardboard headsets, which cost roughly $15, to their smartphones.\n\n\"In one class students can actively explore Machu Picchu and in the next they can explore the inside of the human bloodstream,\" adds Schrom.\n\nAnother shows a rocket launch which physics teachers can use to explain the forces at work there.\n\nThe aim is to provide a tool that can fit into the curriculum, Schrom says.\n\n\"We created a teaching tool as something that could supplement and augment the lessons that are already happening in the classroom,\" added Schrom.\n\n\"We set out to build a really powerful tool to open kids' eyes and catalyze their curiosity of whatever the topic at hand,\" he said.\n\nThere are lesson materials available through the Times Educational Supplement , an online platform where teachers find resources.\n\nStudents can learn about the challenges astronauts face.\n\nShailey Minocha , professor of learning technologies and social computing at the Open University, has been researching the use of 3D and virtual worlds since 2008.\n\nHer team has visited schools over the past year as part of a Google-funded study of the effects of VR tools in education . Using workshops and interviews the team has spoken to around 700 children and educators in the UK.\n\nAmong expeditions is a trip to the International Space Station, where students can get a glimpse of what life is like in space. \"They were putting themselves in the shoes of the astronauts up there,\" Minocha adds.\n\nCreated to help students\n\nThough it's still early days to know what impact VR will have on students, Minocha says researchers have found that students are more analytical after using it.\n\n\"As students grow older they find it difficult to ask the right questions in the class. We wanted to see if Google Expeditions with this VR app can enable students to think more critically and ask better questions,\" says Minocha.\n\nWhat she found was that a higher number of more complex and analytical questions were being asked by students who used technology in addition to pictures, texts, or newspaper articles.\n\nThis was the case both in the classroom and out on real field trips. \"Because if they have used these to prepare for the field trip they were more prepared and more likely to ask more inquisitive questions,\" she said.\n\nThey also found that it could boost engagement, especially for students with teaching assistants and those who have special needs.\n\n\"They were much more vocal and participated in the class,\" Minocha said.\n\nAnother application is Discovery VR . Like Google Expedition, it's free to download and can be used with cardboard headsets.\n\nMore and more VR apps are being developed for smartphones, says Minocha. \"Virtual reality has been around for 20-25 years, but I think it has reached a point now where the adoption is much quicker than ever before.\"\n\nThe Discovery VR app has been downloaded nearly four million times, says Chris Nash, head of community at Discovery Education UK. He has seen that some schools in the UK get around the costs by asking the parents to donate their old smartphones.\n\nDeep sea excursions\n\nThe teacher can guide the lesson through the use of a tablet. Geography students at King's Ely, an independent school in Cambridgeshire, UK, took a tour to the depths of the oceans earlier this year to explore the effects of coral bleaching. The sessions were part of the Open University research project and looked at how VR might improve questioning among the students in year seven or eight (11 and 12-year-olds).\n\nThe students used virtual reality to learn about coral bleaching.\n\n\"Some were lying on the floor as they looked at the corals. There was a lot of instant reaction. It was almost as if they were there, from their perspective,\" says Alan Parkinson, head of geography at King's Ely Junior, who held the class.\n\n\"I selected the particular images they could see. All the students saw the same images, but obviously the direction they were looking at could be different.\"\n\nHe thinks that virtually being down with the corals gave them ideas for further questions, which they might not have asked had they been shown only images or text.\n\nBoosting creativity\n\nThere are a number of other ways VR is being used for education. Titans of Space , for example, is a resource for teaching students about the solar system, by which they can virtually tour the planets as astronauts.\n\nPupils can slide a smartphone into a cardboard headset.\n\nIt can also be used as a tool to show children how an area looks during different times of the day, seasonal changes, or after a few years. This can be combined with real-life field trips to help illustrate environmental destruction, for example by demonstrating changes to flora and fauna, Minocha explains.\n\nGlobal reach\n\nIt's not just teachers across the UK who have embraced VR. \"The impact is pretty worldwide now,\" Nash says.\n\nHe has seen a particularly keen interest in the Middle East, for example in Egypt and in the UAE, where teachers are \"very passionate\" about using this technology.\n\nAre there any drawbacks? Teachers may want to use it sparingly, Parkinson notes. \"The danger is that it's just a novelty which you use because it might be fun, rather than a serious educational reason for doing it.\"\n\nThis is why he plans to use seven or eight kits per class, in rotation. \"You wouldn't want to be looking more than a few minutes at a time, because some of the students said they felt a bit dizzy.\"\n\nAR brings the world into the classroom\n\nThe coming years will see more of this technology in schools. Next up is an augmented reality (AR) application which Google will be trying out in UK schools this fall.\n\nWith augmented reality, users hold up their phone or tablet to see virtual objects placed in the real world.\n\nThis will bring objects like tornadoes or meteorites into classrooms.\n\n\"AR is really great for letting you evaluate an object, and to get up close to it,\" Shrom says.\n\nHe envisions this evolving into a combination of virtual and augmented realities.\n\n\"Over the long term we are thinking of the converging of these two things: VR and AR working with the teacher to provide an even more powerful set of tools.\"\n\nIt seems both students and teachers will be traveling the world much more than before, from the comforts of their classroom.", "\u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0630\u0641\u0627\u062a \"\u0622\u0631 \u0628\u064a \u062c\u064a\" \u0623\u0646\u062a\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u062d\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0641\u064a\u062a\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0633\u062a\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0645\u062a\u0648\u0627\u062c\u062f\u0629 \u0628\u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0628\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0644 \u0648\u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u062d \u0623\u064a\u0642\u0648\u0646\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0644\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0636\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0639.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633 \u060c 01 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Janette Hughes is the Canada Research Chair in Technology and Pedagogy at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology.

The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\n(CNN) As community makerspaces begin to take root in Ontario's elementary schools, students are behaving better. They are also getting higher grades.\n\nWhat are makerspaces? They're creative spaces where students can gather to explore, tinker, discover and create, and they're making students more enthusiastic about school.\n\nIn these spaces students are learning how to tinker collaboratively with a problem and keep trying until they find a solution. They are learning to be thinkers, innovators and problem-solvers rather than mere consumers of information. And these are just some of the benefits teachers are reporting.\n\nMakerspaces support hands-on exploration and learning. They are most often associated with STEM education (science, technology, engineering and math). But really, they're interdisciplinary, promoting important educational principles such as inquiry, play, imagination, innovation, critical thinking, problem solving and passion-based learning.\n\nThey arise from the wider maker movement and they are emerging now in formal education settings globally.\n\nAs the founder of MAKE magazine Dale Dougherty states in his 2011 TED Talk: \"We are all makers.\"\n\nMakerspaces in Ontario schools\n\nIn partnership with the Ontario Ministry of Education, the Council of Ontario Directors of Education and the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, I am leading a team of researchers to put makerspaces into elementary schools in 20 Ontario school boards. My research explores how teachers work together to explore news ways of teaching and learning through makerspaces.\n\nAt a makerspace in Ontario, VR is used as a tool for learning.\n\nOur project began by introducing teachers to a number of innovative ideas and practices in makerspace teaching and learning.\n\nTeachers attended a two-day professional learning session, where they explored digital technologies such as digital circuits, 3D printing, augmented and virtual reality, e-textiles, programmable robots, coding and green screen video work. They had opportunities to collaborate, plan lessons with colleagues and do their own making.\n\nWe then gave funding to each of the first 11 school boards -- to purchase equipment and supplies for participating schools. Researchers then followed teachers to track their use of tools and technologies and their promotion of student inquiry, creativity, design and critical thinking.\n\nTo date, they have created more than 100 maker-focused lesson plans for students in Grades 1 to Grade 8 in both English and French Immersion programs. Nine more school boards have joined for the second year of the project.\n\nTeaching perseverance\n\nTeachers in all participating schools stated that their students are more engaged and more motivated when they are learning in a makerspace environment.\n\nThey also noticed a reduction in discipline problems. And they recorded improvements in academic achievement, particularly among students with learning disabilities and those who struggle in a traditional classroom setting.\n\nGiving students the freedom to pursue projects that are authentic, meaningful and based on their own \"wonderings\" or passions has provided opportunities for a more personalized and inclusive learning experience for all students.\n\nTeachers also observed that a variety of 21st-century skills and competencies were developed as a result of the makerspaces, such as problem-solving, communication, collaboration and the development of perseverance. Collaboration was one of the most highly reported competencies developed across all schools.\n\n\"In the beginning they were nervous,\" said one teacher.\n\n\"They wanted me to help them all the time. But once they got the hang of just trying it, figuring it out, knowing that I'm not going to fix the problem for them, then they would persevere.\"\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy is that the increase in collaboration emerged not just among the students, but the teachers and staff, as well. Inter-generational and bi-directional learning occurred between students and teachers, peers and students of different ages.\n\nA maker mindset\n\nIt can be a challenge to implement a makerspace -- to motivate and train staff, outfit and maintain equipment and the space, and to build a true maker culture in a school. The benefits, however, outweigh the costs and effort.\n\nHaving a maker mindset is key. In order for schools to establish a true makerspace, there must be buy-in and a commitment from staff, students and the wider community -- to establish a culture of innovation, trial-and-error, problem-solving, persevering through difficult tasks, learning from mistakes and taking risks.\n\nA makerspace is so much more than a space that houses equipment. A maker culture fosters 21st-century skills such as communication, collaboration and creativity. It offers opportunities for students to share their learning at local and global community levels through Maker Faires and websites such as www.instructables.com, www.thingiverse.com and www.DIY.org.\n\nIn Ontario, we expect significant and sustainable ongoing benefits in teacher practice when the imaginative, integrated and innovative inquiry-based projects are developed, implemented and shared throughout the province.", "Hong Kong (CNN Business) SoftBank's ties to Saudi Arabia aren't the only big problem facing CEO Masayoshi Son right now.\n\nThe risk of a price war in Japan is threatening the tech tycoon's plan to raise billions of dollars by spinning off the conglomerate's mobile business.\n\nThe IPO is a key part of Son's efforts to reposition the group as a global tech investor.\n\nRival wirelessoperator NTT Docomo ( DCMYY ) announced late Wednesday that it will slash prices for its cellphone plans by as much as 40% from April 2019.

Depending on how well one performed on tests, it often meant certain doors were open -- or closed.\n\nImagine a school now, though, where students choose their own curriculum and teachers are more like mentors guiding them through activities and topics of interest. Instead of homework and tests, portfolios and exhibitions would display your films, writing, art, and creations, and you were constantly encouraged to keep doing more.\n\nA new wave of schools are increasing in number, particularly in the U.S., many of them flipping the traditional style of schooling to a more personalized-style of education.\n\nA little girl plays at the Portfolio school, which opened a year ago.\n\nA new type of school\n\nPortfolio School is a project-based start-up school in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, which emphasizes guided choice and a personalized education, mixing technology with learning activities.\n\nThe school calls itself a \"micro-school\", which aims to broaden a child's creativity and is based on the philosophy that children need an interdisciplinary model of learning.\n\nCurrently, the school has 19 students ranging from ages 5-10 in a single open-plan multi-purpose space with plans to grow to 80 in two years.\n\nPortfolio says its research-based approach is reinventing everything -- from the curriculum, space design, classroom management, schedule, the role of teachers and a student's engagement with the outside world.\n\nOne way of achieving self-motivation is by giving power to the students, said Nancy Otero, a former software engineer who is the director of research and learning design at Portfolio.\n\n\"Our school is more like a studio. Things are open all the time. We have drills, 3D printers. We give them these powerful tools, where they can code and construct,\" said Otero.\n\nChildren at Portfolio learn to build and assemble, using all sorts of tools.\n\nKids can make things out of plaster, they can speak, write, make videos. \"Technology is not viewed as something frightening. It's one of multiple tools,\" said Dr. Shira Leibowitz, director of the lower school at Portfolio.\n\nAt traditional schools, there isn't much time for most of this. \"You need large amounts of time to tinker and play and those schedules (of traditional schools) are very conforming,\" said Leibowitz.\n\nThere's a policy of no homework at Portfolio. \"Research has shown it's not a useful thing. Some of the kids start not wanting to learn so much (with homework),\" said Otero.\n\nWhat's more, says Leibowitz, kids have time to be with their families, time to nurture friendships. \"It's not for everybody, it's very different, but part of what makes it work is that the families are here by choice.\"\n\nPhotos: How students around the world are learning in new ways Bangladesh, solar-powered floating schools \u2013 All around the world, schools are reinventing education.

It has grown to many more locations since.\n\nStripping away the old-school methods\n\nBy taking away the traditional U.S. grading system of A, B, C, D, F, Portfolio say it's liberating students instead of holding them back. \"There's no end limit. In a traditional school if you get an A+, that's it. We've taken away that ceiling so that they (students) keep going. We keep stretching,\" said Leibowitz.\n\nChildren independently problem solve on walls made of whiteboards.\n\nInstead of the typical pat on the back, Leibowitz said she and her team are constantly giving feedback so students can get better and better. \"There's this culture of 'we're so lucky, we can make it better'.\"\n\nWe've created an environment which does two things, said co-founder Doug Schachtel. Portfolio fosters creativity and innovation by enabling students to pursue their interests and giving them space and time to go explore them, he said. The school also ensures students learn the core skills of reading, writing and math at their own pace.\n\n\"We've achieved this innovation not through a software program but being really thoughtful about all the aspects of school,\" he said, when asked about other similar schools.\n\nParents stamp of approval\n\nOne mother of twins who attend Portfolio, Georgia Marantos, said she makes the journey from uptown to downtown Manhattan every day (with a toddler in tow also) as she liked the school so much. Her son was part of an exhibit at the school where students had created their own ice cream machine. Seeing an older nine-year old student present the machine, Marantos' son was inspired. \"He said, 'I want to do that'.\"\n\nOnly 19 students currently attend the Portfolio School, but it plans to have 80 students in two years.\n\n\"That's an opportunity that would never have been there in any other classroom,\" said Marantos, of the experience of mixed age groups working together.\n\nMarantos also praised the positive shift away from being the kid who gets the award or the best grades in class to the one who's creating something incredible.\n\nAnother mother at the school agrees. \"Portfolio believes every child is a genius. They don't dumb down the content because of their age and they stretch the kids beyond their comfort zone. At the same time, the teachers know the kids well and recognize each has different strengths and weaknesses, and they challenge them with great compassion,\" said Jackie Tian.\n\nFinding the right balance\n\nSome say it's too early to know what results will be seen from experimental schools.\n\n\"There's a lot of great innovation in schools right now. Project-based learning can intrinsically motivate students to be creative and explore their own interests -- not just for the sake of a test score or grade. We do a disservice to students though if we shortchange foundational learning. There needs to be a balance,\" said Karyn Wynn, a school administrator based in Palo Alto, California.\n\n\"Learning driven by genuine inquiry sparks a child's mind,\" says Wynn. \"There are also times when you need to rework an essay for the third time or struggle through a proof. Students need to build these muscles to persevere as well.\"\n\nWith a balanced approach, Wynn praises project-based learning. She says the current system of rigid testing causes too much pressure and the stakes are \"ridiculously\" high.\n\n\"It's great to have more creative energy in the education field. We do need to reimagine what is possible,\" she added.", "Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is the Chair of GAVI and the Former Minister of Finance for Nigeria. Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi is the current Minister of State for Tolerance in the United Arab Emirates.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\n\n(CNN) In the movie \"Hidden Figures,\" Janelle Mon\u00e1e's character Mary Jackson petitions a Virginia State Court judge for the right to enroll in engineering classes at the local all-white high school. She reminds the judge that he was the first in his family to join the Armed Forces and to attend college. Now he can help her be the first female engineer at NASA. \"Your Honor,\" Jackson says, \"out of all the cases you're going to hear today, which one is going to matter one hundred years from now? Which one is going to make you the first?\"\n\n\"You are the first,\" is a phrase that the two of us, despite living in starkly different countries, have heard more times than we can remember. It resonates for us both as the world marks International Women's Day. Most notably, we are the first women appointed to our respective cabinet positions. A woman in a leadership role is a rarity in our regions, let alone women like us with economics and computer science backgrounds. No wonder: today, in 2017, 130 million school-age girls around the world are not even in school. The main reason? Existing financial resources for education, especially for girls, both within countries and by multilateral and bilateral donors, are woefully inadequate. We must, as a global community, commit to reversing troubling trends and improving outcomes when it comes to girls' education -- and education for all children.\n\nThe world renewed its commitment to changing this situation when it pledged to ensure \"inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all.\" And this Sustainable Development Goal comes bound to the promise of results by 2030. The goal is based on the knowledge that education is the pathway for safer, more prosperous and inclusive societies. For we know that educating a girl does far more than place a child behind a desk. It is the surest pathway to reducing infant mortality, mitigating high birthrates, slowing migratory pressures and unlocking economic potential.\n\nAs noted in a recent report by our Commission, a one-year increase in schooling for girls is associated with reduction in mortality of 4.2% for children under the age of five. Furthermore, a child that begins preschool education in 2017 will see lifetime earnings nearly five times that of their parents and 12 times the cost of their education. And a case study from Brazil shows us low-income girls who participated in community preschool programs were two times more likely to reach fifth grade and three times more likely to reach eighth grade than their peers who did not attend preschool.\n\nYet at a time when we need to invest more, we are investing less. The share of international aid to education has fallen from 13 to 10% since 2002 . At the national level, there is significant variation among countries. But we can say that, on average, education's share of total government spending has slightly declined across countries of all income groups since 2000 . Furthermore, children caught in emergency situations -- whether armed conflict or a natural disaster -- see their education treated as a luxury rather than a necessity. In practice, humanitarian aid for education remains critically underfunded, with less than 2% of pledges directed toward education.\n\nThe outcomes are clear enough. According to the Education Commission's Learning Generation report , at current trends, by 2030, 825 million children in low and middle-income countries -- half of the world's 1.6 billion children -- will lack the basic secondary-level skills.\n\nFor Africa there is a particular sense of urgency. A few countries such as Togo and Ethiopia have made strides by raising enrollment levels and expanding domestic financing for education. But these successes are counterbalanced, and indeed outweighed, by wide deficits that must be tackled. If things stay the same, by 2030, only about half of Sub-Saharan Africa's youth will complete high school.\n\nIn response to this alarming situation, we are calling for the largest expansion of educational opportunity in history. It is doable. The Education Commission, on which we both serve as Commissioners, has outlined a plan to gradually increase annual education spending in all low- and middle-income countries from $1.2 trillion today to $3 trillion by 2030. This plan is underpinned not just by more funds directed toward education globally, but the better use of existing funds -- a blend of reform and investment.\n\nNow we look to national governments to expand their financial commitment to education. And where governments do step up and commit to expanded education financing, we believe this pledge should trigger support from the international community. This compact has led the Commission to develop a breakthrough proposal for an International Financing Facility for education -- a body that can close the financing gap by bringing the World Bank, regional development banks and donors together in a more coordinated fashion, proving the power of international cooperation.\n\nAt a time when millions of migrant and refugee children around the world are displaced -- when countries like Lebanon and Chad must do the impossible to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugee girls and boys in their classrooms -- ensuring there are adequate resources flowing to effectively educate our children is the wisest and smartest way to invest.\n\nFor more opinion...

part by his frequent falsehoods and misleading statements, claimed Wednesday he tries to be truthful.\n\n\"I remember, you remember well in the campaign, you made a promise. You said, 'I will never lie to you,'\" ABC News' Jon Karl said to Trump in a new interview. \"So can you tell me now, honestly, have you kept that promise at all times? Have you always been truthful?\"\n\n\"Well I try. I mean, I do try. I think you try, too. You say things about me that are not necessarily correct,\" Trump replied. \"I do try, and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth.\"\n\n\"I mean sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change. But I always like to be truthful,\" he added.\n\nTrump's comments are especially notable coming at the close of a contentious campaign season in which he has repeatedly engaged in smears and falsehoods to advance Republican electoral fortunes, from inflating his rally crowd sizes to accusing Democrats, frequently without evidence, of supporting ruinous immigration policies.\n\nRead More", "Story highlights Hibs boss Lennon hit by coin\n\nHearts goalkeeper \"punched\"\n\nPolice Scotland make five arrests\n\n(CNN) A goalkeeper \"punched\" by a football supporter during a game.

And now, almost 50 years later, \"Apollo VII-XVII,\" a new book from teNeues, relives the drama of the program's 11 missions.\n\nIt includes a special foreword by Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham, and breathtaking photos taken by Apollo astronauts, many of which were previously unpublished.\n\nThese important photos -- such as \"Earthrise,\" taken from lunar orbit by astronaut Bill Anders, and an image capturing the world's 13 tallest peaks in a single frame -- not only presented us with different ways of seeing the world and advanced our scientific understanding, but also provided new insights into a new world of photography.\n\nPhotography for astronauts\n\nEarly astronauts of the Apollo missions are often hailed as explorers, scientists and heroes, but rarely are they depicted as some of the most noteworthy photographers in history. The rigorous training program they undertook included photography, according to Cunningham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 11 Astronaut Walt Cunningham looks out of the Command Module window during Apollo 7's 11-day orbit around the Earth.

The agency also offered tutorials in locations like Nevada and Arizona, where the geological conditions were similar to the lunar surface.\n\nNASA later stationed an expert at mission control centers to answer photography-related questions.\n\n'Space cameras'\n\nNASA's emphasis on space photography grew as the Apollo missions progressed. Astronauts were tasked with documenting topographic and geological data, as well as the condition of their spacecraft. But space missions required different types of cameras and lenses.\n\nRadical VR installation flies you to the moon\n\nIt was astronaut Walter Schirra, an amateur photographer and one of the pilots of Project Mercury (NASA's first manned space program) who suggested that his own Hasselblad 500C camera seemed to meet NASA's requirements. His modified device brought back stunning images from his 1962 mission and led to a collaboration between NASA and Hasselblad that continued for decades.\n\nOther cameras used in the program include the Hasselblad Super Wide Camera, enabled a huge picture coverage, and Nikon's 35mm Photomic FTn camera, modified to withstand extreme gravitational forces.\n\nGerman lens manufacturer Carl Zeiss also worked closely with NASA. Their collaboration resulted in one of the world's highest speed camera lenses.\n\nCapturing Earth from space\n\nDifficult conditions, such as operating in low-gravity conditions in bulky space suits, often interfered with astronauts' abilities to take photos. Clouds could also make photography challenging, as they usually cover around 55% of the Earth's surface.\n\nPhoto of Earth taken during the Apollo 8 mission.

That was an easy rule to follow. In 11 days and many passes over China, we never saw the surface because of the cloud cover and smog in their atmosphere.\"", "Washington (CNN) The little girl who went viral for being awestruck with Michelle Obama's portrait dressed as the former first lady this Halloween.\n\nEarlier this year, then-2-year-old Parker Curry was photographed staring at Amy Sherald's portrait of Obama at the National Portrait Gallery, completely enthralled with the image towering over her.\n\nHappy #Halloween ! Can you guess who I am? pic.twitter.com/LZA95MT9rl\n\nWhen Halloween rolled around, Parker, now 3, stepped out for trick-or-treating dressed as Obama, complete with a gown that replicates the Milly dress that the first lady is wearing in her portrait, according to posts on her Twitter and Instagram accounts.\n\nObama responded on Twitter Thursday morning, saying \"You nailed the look, Parker! I love it!\"\n\nYou nailed the look, Parker! I love it!!!! \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/40CArze8gT\n\nIt was Parker's idea to be Obama and \"her first immediate response\" when asked what she wanted to dress as for Halloween, her mother Jessica Curry told CNN.\n\n\"We asked her a few times, 'Are you sure?'\" Curry told CNN. \"'Yes, I do. I want to be Michelle Obama.'\"\n\nParker's dress was a gift from Alisha Welsh, who runs a small, family based company in New York, Magnolia Lake Children's Clothing, according to Curry. Welsh had offered to make Parker her own Obama dress back in March when she was inspired by the photo of Parker.\n\nWhen Parker first saw the dress that arrived on Halloween morning, Curry recalled, \"her jaw dropped.\"\n\n\"She was just like, 'Wow.' She was really excited. She was giggly,\" Curry said.\n\nCurry told CNN that when she asked Parker if she liked the dress, Parker replied, \"'It's perfect.'\"\n\nWhen trick-or-treating around the neighborhood, \"some people did recognize the dress and were tickled although none of them probably made the connection that (it) was Parker,\" Curry told CNN. \"She got way too much candy.\"\n\nCurry told CNN that Parker asked to wear it again Thursday morning to school. Curry said that she would not be surprised if Parker picked to be Obama again next Halloween.\n\nBuzzFeed News was the first to report on Parker's costume choice.\n\nBack in March, Curry told CNN that Parker \"believes Michelle Obama is a queen, and she wants to be a queen as well.\"\n\n\"As a female and as a girl of color, it's really important that I show her people who look like her that are doing amazing things and are making history so that she knows she can do it,\" she told CNN then.\n\nThat viral image of Parker entranced by Obama's portrait led to her coming face to face (and having a dance party) with her idol in real life and later an appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\"", "(CNN) \u2014 Passengers at some European airports will soon be questioned by artificial intelligence-powered lie detectors at border checkpoints, as a European Union trial of the technology is set to begin.\n\nFliers will be asked a series of travel -related questions by a virtual border guard avatar, and artificial intelligence will monitor their faces to assess whether they are lying.\n\nThe avatar will become \"more skeptical\" and change its tone of voice if it believes a person has lied, before referring suspect passengers to a human guard and allowing those believed to be honest to pass through, said Keeley Crockett of Manchester Metropolitan University in England, who was involved in the project.\n\nThe \u20ac4.5 million ($5.1 million) project, called iBorderCtrl , will be tested this month at airports in Hungary, Latvia and Greece on passengers traveling from outside the EU, with the aim of reducing congestion.\n\nRelated content Instead of the boarding pass, bring your smile to the airport\n\n\"It will ask the person to confirm their name, age and date of birth, (and) it will ask them things like what the purpose of their trip is and who is funding the trip,\" said Crockett.\n\nBut privacy groups have raised concerns about the trial.\n\n\"This is part of a broader trend towards using opaque, and often deficient, automated systems to judge, assess and classify people,\" said Frederike Kaltheuner, data program lead at Privacy International, who called the test \"a terrible idea.\"\n\nThe technology has been tested in its current form on only 32 people, and scientists behind the project are hoping to achieve an 85% success rate.\n\nPrevious facial recognition algorithms have been found to have higher error rates when analyzing women and darker-skinned people, with an MIT study earlier this year finding that technology developed by companies including IBM and Microsoft contained biases.\n\n\"Traditional lie detectors have a troubling history of incriminating innocent people. There is no evidence that AI is going to fix that -- especially a tool that has been tested in 32 people,\" Kaltheuner added.\n\n\"Even seemingly small error rates mean that thousands of people now have to prove that they are honest people, just because some software said they are liars,\" he added.\n\n\"I don't believe that you can have a 100% accurate system,\" Crockett said in response to criticism, adding that the technology will become more accurate as it is tested on more passengers.\n\nThe system will be overseen by human guards, who can see the results of the AI tests on each passenger.\n\nOnly passengers who give their consent will come face-to-face with the technology in its initial trial, with consent forms available at the airports when they arrive.", "",

significant Sunday yet of his young life, just inner contentment at a childhood ambition achieved. Perhaps it should be of no surprise that a teenager who spends his time racing at body-rattling speeds kept his cool when told he was to become the youngest Formula One driver in British history.\n\n\"It was a good moment,\" says the 18-year-old of the day he learned he would be on the grid next year in McLaren's orange livery as part of an elite band of 20 elite racing drivers.\n\nIt had been a relatively ordinary race weekend for Norris at September's Italian Grand Prix, until he was called into the boss' office.\n\nThe Briton, not 19 until November 13, had completed his duties as McLaren's test and reserve driver. His performance in what was just his second F1 practice sessions, in wet conditions, showcasing his speed and ability.\n\n\"I was just about to get in the car to head to the airport after the weekend and Zak called me,\" Norris remembers of the meeting that will inevitably change his life, even if, the teenager insists, much has remained the same since the deal made headlines.\n\nNorris was the youngest winner of the world karting championship in 2014, aged 14.\n\nZak Brown is McLaren's chief executive, a man who has described Norris as an \"immense talent,\" anointing the prodigious Englishman as the racer to help the team rebuild and become the force it was a decade or so ago, when winning titles -- not languishing towards the back of the grid -- was routine.\n\nNorris has already passed an early test. Once told he would replace Stoffel Vandoorne, a driver eight years his senior, next season Norris proved he was capable of keeping a secret. Not even his mum, Cisca, was told he was to become McLaren's next boy-king until the morning of the official announcement.\n\nIf I could go back and tell this guy he'd be a @McLarenF1 driver in 2019, he wouldn't believe me. Amazing opportunity. Dream come true #Lando19 pic.twitter.com/v0MZISgxrj \u2014 Lando Norris (@LandoNorris) September 3, 2018\n\n\"The first guys I was allowed to tell was my manager and trainer because they pretty much get to know everything,\" Norris explains.\n\n\"They were the only two guys I was allowed to tell. It was a bit weird that I couldn't say too much to anyone, but it was obviously a nice feeling inside.\n\n\"I then told my dad, he was allowed to know because I had to sign the contract and he was present for that, but even my mum I wasn't allowed to say anything to. She was a bit annoyed I didn't tell her earlier but that's the way it was.\"\n\nNorris' mum cried the morning he told her that the next stage of his journey to racing stardom was about to begin. Tears were shed for the countless childhood weekends spent away from home, for the hard work, the dedication, and the dreams her son had already achieved.\n\n\"I've been away since I was pretty much eight, traveling to the car tracks, and then going to Europe and traveling more,\" says Norris, a veteran of seven different junior motorsport categories and a champion in three, including becoming the youngest champion of the prestigious European Formula Three series in 2017.\n\n\"Then having to do more things; more meetings, more media days, and eventually move out to my own place. I've been away from my mum a lot, but she's always been there to support me.\"\n\nNorris pictured driving during practice at the Japanese Grand Prix\n\nNorris is close to his family. He travels to races with his father, Adam, once a talented road cyclist with ambitions of competing in the Tour de France before making his millions in investment banking. There is an older brother, Oli, who sells simulators, the eldest of his younger sisters, Flo, a talented horse rider, and another sister, also called Cisca, who is still at school.\n\nHis father, Norris says, has been the biggest influence on his career, for both his financial and emotional support. \"He brought me to the Kart track after school when I was young,\" he says. \"He got me into racing and he's supported me ever since. He's the reason I'm here now.\"\n\nIt was a family decision to allow the 16-year-old Norris to leave school, the independent Millfield in Somerset, to focus on his racing. Giving up the classroom was an easy decision for a boy who openly admits he was not a scholar, but leaving behind his friends was the biggest sacrifice he has had to make.\n\nIn 2016 Norris won the Formula Renault 2.0 European Cup and the Eurocup Formula 2.0 title\n\n\"I never enjoyed school and I was never that good at school so leaving wasn't the biggest thing, but the social aspect of school, leaving your friends, you lose contact with them a bit and now I have more friends at the race track than the friends I keep in touch with at school,\" says Norris, reflecting on the cost of making it onto the grid.\n\n\"That's one of the biggest things. Never being home, always traveling, having different interests and focusing on different things, just the time aspect of going back home and seeing them, you don't have that at all. It was a big sacrifice but, at the end of the day, it was worth it.\"\n\nSpeaking over the phone during the US Grand Prix weekend, Norris' answers are considered, there is no hint of self-importance. His Twitter feed is full of gifs and witty remarks, just like any normal teenager's account would be. The prospect of making history has not turned a young man's head.\n\nThe closest I'll get to growing a moustache this year \ud83e\uddd4\ud83c\udffb #Movember pic.twitter.com/IFA41WOtTU \u2014 Lando Norris (@LandoNorris) October 30, 2018\n\nHe currently lives in a shared flat in Guildford, an English town an hour or so from London, with Formula Three driver Sacha Fenestraz. In his first news conference after McLaren had announced he would be climbing into their seat, Norris said he had no plans yet to relocate to the glitz and glamor, and of course the favorable tax system, of Monaco where many past and present F1 drivers reside.\n\n\"Given the team's current state, they are in need of more help than they ever have been, and I will help them as much as I can rather than having a nice life in Monaco,\" he told assembled reporters.\n\nJUST WATCHED The tragic history of the Mexico Grand Prix Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\n\nLife, however, has been lived at top speed these last few months as Norris combines F1 and F2 -- where he is currently third in the overall standings -- and squeezes in the proliferation of media interviews. \"It was pretty crazy,\" says Norris of the weeks following McLaren's announcement in September.\n\n\"In karting, in the European races, you have the cameras and the film crews and you do interviews. At around 13 I'd already started doing bit of media and it just increases more and more with every level you take, especially when you get into cars -- and when you hit F1 it's an even higher step up. It's something you get used to over time. It's part of the job.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Formula One drivers' dream circuits Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Formula One drivers' dream circuits 02:58\n\nInevitably, parallels have been drawn with five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. \"I would say in 95% of interviews I get asked about Lewis Hamilton,\" he says without a sign of exasperation.\n\nThe comparisons are perhaps unavoidable. Hamilton was also an English F1 star-in-waiting who learned his trade under McLaren's umbrella, though Hamilton made his F1 debut in 2007 in a more competitive car. Yet, for all the similarities, their upbringings were polar opposites. Hamilton grew up in a council house in Stevenage, while Norris's father has made a $255 million fortune in financial services.\n\nThe pair first worked together during Daytona 24 in January, where they shared one of the cars run by Brown's United Autosports team.\n\nPhotos: Story of the F1 season Lewis Hamilton celebrates his 10th win of the season as he takes the Brazilian GP ahead of Max Verstappen and Kimi Raikkonen.

Fast-forward a few years and they're going to be waaaay longer according to new forecasts that say the volume of global air passengers is set to more than double over the next two decades.\n\nBy 2040, air passengers will be taking a total of 20.9 billion journeys, according to the Airports Council International, a global body that represents the planet's airports. That's a huge travel leap from from 8.2 billion passenger trips in 2017.\n\nSo where will these extra passengers be coming from?

In September, the US Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration classified Epidiolex as a Schedule V substance , clearing the final hurdle for it to be legally prescribed by doctors in the United States. (Marijuana and CBD remain Schedule I substances .)\n\n\"Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies supported Epidiolex's approval, so prescribers can have confidence in the drug's uniform strength and consistent delivery that support appropriate dosing needed for treating patients with these complex and serious epilepsy syndromes,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a written statement. \"The FDA will continue to support rigorous scientific research on the potential medical uses of marijuana-derived products and stand ready to work with product developers who are interested in bringing patients safe and effective, high quality products.\"\n\nDr. Orrin Devinsky, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Health , served as the lead investigator of two of three phase three clinical trials of Epidiolex.\n\nJUST WATCHED Your brain on marijuana Replay More Videos ...

Many had a modest improvement, and some had no improvement. So it's not a miracle drug. It's an effective drug, and I think its side effect profile is quite good compared to other seizure drugs that we have, but it's not a miracle cure,\" Devinsky said.\n\nThe most common side effects of Epidiolex, according to GW Pharmaceuticals, include sleepiness, decreased appetite, diarrhea and an increase in liver enzymes.\n\nShauna Garris, a pharmacist, pharmacy clinical specialist and adjunct assistant professor at the University of North Carolina's Eshelman School of Pharmacy , said the drug is effective and works somewhere between \"fairly\" and \"very well.\" She has not used Epidiolex in her own clinical practice and was not involved in the development of the drug but said she's not sure it will live up to \"all of the hype\" that has surrounded it.\n\nStill, she said the FDA's approval of Epidiolex signals \"validation of the science of cannabinoid medication.\"\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals says the average list price of Epidiolex is $32,500 a year. The company expects that the drug will be covered by most insurance plans and asserts that \"this price is in line with other branded, FDA-approved anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Banzel, and access for eligible patients is expected to be similar to such AEDs for similar indications for LGS (e.g., Onfi and Banzel).\"\n\nIt is also launching a patient support program \"to help patients who have been prescribed Epidiolex gain access to therapy. The program offers patient/caregiver-focused education and resources to help lower out-of-pocket costs or provide product at no cost for eligible patients.\"\n\nAlthough Epidiolex is approved only for the treatment of two rare seizure disorders, doctors can now prescribe the medication \"off-label\" for other conditions.

changed its baggage policy for the second time this year in an attempt to reduce delays.\n\nAccording to a statement on the Ryanair website, passengers will now have to pay if they want to travel with a small suitcase.\n\nUnder previous rules introduced in January, passengers who had not paid for priority boarding were allowed to bring a \"personal bag,\" such as a handbag, into the cabin, while a small suitcase could be checked in to the hold free of charge.\n\nRelated content Ryanair's strikes are hitting its profits and stock price\n\nHowever departures suffered disruption as up to 120 bags were checked in at the airport ahead of each flight, reports the UK's Press Association.\n\nIn response, Ryanair has decided to end the free hold baggage offer.\n\nRyanair CEO Michael O'Leary Getty Images\n\nUnder the new policy, non-priority boarding passengers are still allowed to bring a \"personal bag\" into the cabin free of charge, but there will be a fee of \u20ac8 ($9) to check in a small suitcase weighing up to 10 kilograms (22 pounds).\n\nPassengers who purchase priority boarding will still be allowed to bring a \"personal bag\" and a small suitcase onto the plane.\n\nRyanair says the new policy won't affect many of its customers, PA reports, as 30% of them buy priority boarding and another 30% bring only a \"personal bag.\"\n\nPassengers traveling with more luggage can still opt to pay \u20ac25 for up to 20kg, which was the cheapest check-in bag available under the old policy.", "\u0628\u0631\u0644\u064a\u0646 (CNN)-- \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0641

everything to prepare yourself for Election Day, you could still be turned away at the polls.\n\nIn recent years, almost two dozen US states have implemented laws that impose new restrictions on voting, which critics say disproportionally affect minority voters\n\nThe stricter laws stem from a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down parts of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which required the approval of the Justice Department before states made any changes to their voting laws.\n\nIn the last five years at least 23 states have placed restrictions on voting by closing polling places, cutting early voting, purging allegedly ineligible voters from electoral rolls and imposing stricter voter ID laws, reports the federal Commission on Civil Rights\n\nWith midterm elections around the corner and early voting already underway, it can be a tricky situation for thousands who are just looking to legally exercise their civic right as American citizens.\n\nBut no matter what unexpected issues you encounter at your polling place, there are ways to make sure your vote gets in safely. Here are some tips.\n\nKnow your state's registration deadline\n\nFirst, it's time to confirm the basics: Your registration status and your polling location. A polling locator website can help you double check both of those.\n\nIf you're not registered, you should check your state's registration deadline requirement ASAP. While some registration deadlines have passed, 16 states allow for Election Day registration and other states have deadlines that stop short of November 6th.\n\nUpdate your information\n\nSome states have enacted extremely tight policies when it comes to voter information. Proponents of these policies say it's to curb voter fraud, but critics say it's an effort to suppress voters by calling out irrelevant, technical mismatches.\n\nPeople cast their ballots during early voting October 25, 2018 in Potomac, Maryland.\n\nGeorgia's \"exact match\" policy , for instance, requires your voter application to exactly mirror Social Security Administration data or the state's Department of Driver Services information. That means if there is ANY discrepancy between your names -- a shortened version of a name or a misspelling or different last name, you could run into issues.\n\nHave you moved lately? Make sure your address is updated, as this is another discrepancy that could stop you from voting.\n\nCheck to see if you need an ID, and what kind\n\nVoters cast ballots during early voting in 2016 in Chicago.\n\nDid you know that not all states require an ID to vote? Just 34 request some form of identification , while the rest use methods like a signature. States have different laws on whether you need your ID with you or what kind of ID it should be, so be sure to look it up.\n\nEven if your state doesn't require an ID to vote, it's best to bring one if you have one. Being over-prepared is just another layer of protection against voter suppression.\n\nRemember that, most likely, you are LEGALLY ALLOWED to vote\n\nWhat if you are told your registration didn't go through, or you don't have the required documents? Even if your registration is pending or your voter application has been wrongly purged, you are still allowed to vote.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, if your qualifications are challenged, some states will have you sign a sworn statement that you satisfy your state's requirements and allow you to cast a regular ballot.\n\nOr, if you did forget your ID at home or have been removed from the registration system, you can cast a provisional ballot -- a right all voters are entitled to by federal law\n\nIf an individual declares that such individual is a registered voter in the jurisdiction in which the individual desires to vote and that the individual is eligible to vote in an election for Federal office, but the name of the individual does not appear on the official list of eligible voters for the polling place or an election official asserts that the individual is not eligible to vote, such individual shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot... \u00a715482, Chapter 146, Title 42 of the 2009 United States Code\n\nHowever, you're going to need to be your biggest advocate when it comes to provisional ballots: These ballots are typically kept separately from all other ballots, so make sure to follow up with your local elected officials to confirm they have looked into your qualifications and have counted the vote.\n\nWhen all else fails, insist\n\nSpeaking of being your biggest advocate, this is why doing your homework and arming yourself with legal knowledge is absolutely necessary. If you feel you are being illegally prevented from voting, you need to insist.\n\nIt could be a misunderstanding. Remember, poll workers may not be as as familiar with state and federal law and try to deny you your right to vote if your name is not in the system. Ask them to check surrounding registration systems for your name and insist on your right to sign an affidavit or cast a provisional ballot.\n\nIf you're aggressively being questioned about your right to cast a vote, you can calmly and clearly state you are exercising your legal right to vote. Report the behavior to other poll workers and peacefully communicate your intent. You should also report such incidents to election hotlines or local and state officials as voter intimidation. You have a few options:\n\nCall a state or local election hotline to report any problems you're having with the voting process.\n\nCall the Department of Justice voting rights hotline (1-800-253-3931) if you think your rights have been violated\n\nYou don't have to go alone\n\nHere's something else you may not know: Any residents who can't see well, have a disability, or have trouble reading or writing or understanding English can bring someone with them to the polls . This can be a friend or relative, but can't be a boss or labor union representative.\n\nHere's the bottom line: If you know your rights, know the law, do your homework and stand your ground, no one will be able to take away your vote.", "They're expecting a bumper holiday shopping season, but in the tightest labor market in nearly half a century, recruiting the legions of temporary workers who usually help out at the end of the year is proving difficult.\n\nOne solution: Offer workers more hours, which can make them eligible for health benefits and other accoutrements of full-time work.\n\n\"These candidates are demanding 40 hours a week, and they can,\" says Erika Mendez, senior vice president of a staffing firm called Pyramid Consulting Group. \"A lot of the power is in their hands, and the employer has to bend to that power.\"\n\nIt's a step away from the part-time model that retailers have adopted to save money on wages and benefits when store traffic is slow.\n\nRetail still trails industries that require skilled labor. Manufacturing and construction workers now average 40.8 and 38.9 hours respectively. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in September that the average workweek for retail jobs has rebounded to 31 hours, up from a low of 29.4 hours in early 2014.\n\nthe largest decline in the share of all jobs posted that are part-time since 2016 \u2014 by nearly 40% in some positions. According to an analysis by the career website Indeed.com , jobs in retail experiencedthe largest decline in the share of all jobs posted that are part-time since 2016 \u2014 by nearly 40% in some positions.\n\n\"It is my understanding that in order to attract people, we are giving them additional hours,\" says Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation.\n\nThose hours might not be from nine to five, but they can at least allow people to make a living without having to work another job in between.\n\nThat move has been a long time coming. The percentage of workers employed part time because they couldn't find full time jobs trailed the unemployment rate after the last recession. But it is now almost back to its pre-recession level\n\nThe change is already apparent to workers like Jay Marzan, who recently landed a full-time job working at store selling smart glasses in Brooklyn.\n\nShe had been making a living on short-term retail pop-ups and fashion shows ever since losing her job at a hotel in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in mid-2017. She worked a few weeks at a time, selling everything from Sharper Image gadgets to makeup. It was exciting: One time an employer even flew her to London to promote singer Rihanna's lingerie line.\n\n\"I kind of liked working projects, because it was never dull,\" says Marzan, who also works as a DJ on the side.\n\nJay Marzan had been working short-term retail gigs, but just landed a full time job at a store in Brooklyn.\n\nBut sometimes the jobs would fall through, and a volatile income made it hard to maintain her health coverage or plan for the future.\n\n\"Do I want to have a life insurance policy? Do I want to have the income coming in? Do I want to have my company paying for my health insurance?\" Even for Marzan, who enjoyed the variety of on-and-off work, the answer to those questions was yes.\n\nExisting employees are also seeing the effect of the tightening market.\n\nAdecco, one of the country's largest staffing and recruiting agencies, says that employers are learning that giving additional hours to existing employees rather than hiring more of them means less time spent on training and recruiting. Some of them are now even offering bonuses \u2014 on top of overtime pay \u2014 for working more than 45 hours a week.\n\n\"In terms of our clients, their number one objective is to increase their productivity, and they usually prefer to do that through technology,\" says Adecco Senior Vice President Amy Glaser. \"Usually their last go-to is extending work hours, but there are some advantages.\"\n\nIn addition, full-time workers tend to become better at their jobs, which can mean employers don't have to hire as many. And they're less likely to jump somewhere else for marginally higher wages, reducing turnover costs.\n\nstudy at the Gap released this year found that sales and productivity rose when workers were guaranteed a minimum number of hours, consistent shifts, and schedules in advance.\n\n\"I think there is growing awareness by business that improving the stability and predictability of workers' schedules can be good for them and for employees,\" says Susan Lambert, an associate professor at the University of Chicago's School of Social Administration who helped conduct the Gap study.\n\nAnd even with unemployment low, there's still plenty of slack in the market among workers who want more hours \u2014 which could be a hidden saving grace at a time when retailers have announced 700,000 new holiday positions, the most since the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas started tracking them in 2012.\n\nDaniel Schneider, an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley, is part of a team of researchers looking at the impact of work schedules on peoples' lives. In a nationwide survey of 11,000 workers in the retail and restaurant industries conducted through Facebook in the first half of 2018, they found that 59% wanted more hours \u2014 significantly more than the BLS' measure of involuntary part time work.\n\n\"This is not a story of how we have maxed out the hours that people can work,\" Schneider says. \"Neither one of these data points says there's a massive change of a part-time workforce to a full-time one.\"\n\nIn recent years, several cities have passed laws aimed at making schedules more stable and predictable . Some of them give existing workers first dibs on new hours that become available.\n\nIn 2016, Washington D.C. passed a law requiring that building service employees must have access to a minimum of 30 hours a week as a result of advocacy by the powerful Service Employees International Union, which represents many of the city's janitors and security guards.\n\nIt made a difference for Leticia Reyes, a 54-year-old janitor who every weeknight cleans an office on K Street downtown. Before the law passed, she only worked 5 hours a day. Since that didn't meet the 30-hour threshold necessary for her to receive healthcare benefits, she relied on Medicaid.\n\nNow, Reyes works 6-hour shifts, and has full health coverage sponsored by her employer. At $15.60 an hour, the extra hours allowed her to make enough money to stop doing odd jobs on the side and spend more time with her elderly mother.\n\n\"Before, I was feeling like I aged faster, because I had no money,\" Reyes said in Spanish, through a translator. \"Now I can breathe.\"", "\u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 (CNN) \u2013 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0646 \u0648\u0632\u064a\u0631

It could be laziness, it could be a fashion statement, or maybe it's a way for men to look out for each other.\n\nMany men are giving their razors November off to raise awareness and funds for men's health. Men die on average five years earlier than women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prostate and testicular cancer contribute to the disparity. Also, four out of five people who kill themselves are men.\n\nNo-Shave November\n\nMovember Foundation\n\nIf a full beard isn't your manly MO, how about a mustache?\n\nThe Movember Foundation is a top nongovernmental funder of prostate and testicular cancer research. It began in Australia (where a mustache is sometimes called a \"mo\") in 2006. The organization has raised $837 million across more than 20 countries.\n\nNelly Ivanova shows her support for prostate cancer awareness with a fake mustache.\n\nMark Hedstrom, the hirsute Movember spokesman, said his organization expects up to 400,000 \"Mo Bros\" and \"Mo Sistas\" to participate (women don't have to commit to the mustache part). Each participant can set up a fundraising page online, through which the organization hopes to raise $100 million globally this year.\n\nIn early 2019, Movember plans to sprout a massive education campaign called 50 Million Men. The program aims to reach 50 million gentlemen with crucial guidance about men's health. Hedstrom said that by 2030, Movember hopes its efforts will help cut prostate cancer deaths by 50% and male suicides by 25%.\n\nIn the meantime, Movember provides a list of five ways beyond mustaches to protect loved ones from common men's health threats.\n\nSimply asking a man in your life how he's doing can help fend off depression. Men of a certain age should have regular prostate exams. And all men should commit to staying active and moving regularly.\n\nBut when it comes to funding men's health research, the solution may be right under your nose ... or on your face.\n\nFamiliar faces\n\nSome well-known mugs are playing along.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe Jolly Green Giant is already sporting a mustache, and not just on the vegetable brand's logo. The 55-foot-tall giant in Green Earth, Minnesota, is wearing a 4-foot-long mustache Ad Week reports. Mr. Monopoly drew one on, too. And Mr. Peanut is joining the fun as part of Planters' #SaveYourNuts campaign raising awareness of testicular cancer.\n\nIf they can do it, you can do it. Start growing now. You can still make it by just a hair.\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated with the correct spelling of the Movember Foundation.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "I've always said this year has kind of been, really, the year of the quarterbacks. Drew Brees becoming the all-time leading passer, Tom Brady's still doing his thing at the age of 41. But I kind of see the young guns, the young quarterbacks that are rising.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is taking the league by storm, lighting it up. Deshaun Watson seems like he's overcome that ACL injury, this past week throwing for five touchdowns. Jared Goff is leading the way for the undefeated Los Angeles Rams.\n\nI just think the league is in pretty good hands with the young guys that we've got leading the way. You can kind of see the passing of the torch from the legendary quarterbacks like Brees and Brady down to the young guys.\n\nRams quarterback Jared Goff is the second quarterback to lead his team to an 8-0 record before the age of 25. The other was Dan Marino.\n\nMahomes and Watson are 23, and Goff just turned 24. They all have their teams in first place in their respective divisions. Do they have staying power?\n\nYes. I just think those guys are the future. You look at what they've done and the success they had so early in their careers. They're only going to get better, as the game tends to slow down (and) they get familiar with the coaches and the offenses and the defensive schemes that they're trying to do.\n\nI think the future is bright for the NFL with the young quarterbacks that we have.\n\nDeshaun Watson threw for five touchdowns in the Texans' win against the Dolphins last Thursday.\n\nHow much do you think it helped the second-year Mahomes by learning from Alex Smith and not taking the reigns when he as a rookie?\n\nSometimes sitting out as a rookie helps you learn how to be a professional athlete. You sit back and watch guys what they do on a day-to-day regimen: coming in early, learning the plays, getting the workout in during the week and then what you're doing with your time when you're away from the building, when you're away from the office. I think that is very key to a lot of young guys coming into the league, especially the quarterbacks.\n\nMahomes sat for most of last season, learning from then-Chiefs starter Alex Smith.\n\nFor a lot of quarterbacks, you get thrust into the limelight. It's a whirlwind, from practice, the speed of the game and to the nightlife. Going out, every restaurant you go to, there are always distractions, so it's really hard to stay focused if you kind of get thrust into the starting role at such an early age.\n\nWhat about 25-year-old Carson Wentz? He, like Watson, is coming back from a serious knee injury.\n\nI think what he did last year, before his injury, he was on his way to winning MVP. But I think having that little taste of success put a lot of pressure coming into this year, being that his backup (Nick Foles) led them to winning the Super Bowl.\n\nWith three touchdowns, Carson Wentz led the Eagles past the Jaguars in London.\n\nThe pressure I think for Wentz is probably more than the other young guys, being in the sense that where he was before he got hurt to now. And look at Watson. He kind of struggled earlier this year, too, coming back from the same knee injury.\n\nI just think over time you kind of get over that mindset, that you're going to be OK and get back to playing football. And I think that's what Wentz will do, is just get back to what he did last year.\n\nAt age 24, is the Jameis Winston era over in Tampa?\n\nBuccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston stands in the bench area after being replaced by Ryan Fitzpatrick against the Bengals.\n\nI think so. Right now, going back and forth between Ryan Fitzpatrick and Winston, you just don't know. You're given an opportunity in certain places in the league, and I just think he hasn't maximized his opportunity in down in Tampa.\n\nSometimes change is good, not only for the organization, but the player as well. It's just putting the right environment and right situation for Winston. Maybe he can go somewhere else and thrive. I think the Winston era is done in Tampa.\n\nThe Giants are 1-7 and have already made a couple of trades. With the dismantling of the team, are Eli Manning's days numbered?\n\nEli Manning is sacked by Washington's Matthew Ioannidis. The Giants dropped to 1-7 with their latest loss.\n\nYes. I think his past bought him some time the last couple of years just because of what he's done. He won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants.\n\nBut talentwise, Saquon Barkley, Odell Beckham Jr., those are the faces of that team. It's no longer Eli. As you get older as a player, the hardest thing to do is look at yourself in the mirror and see if you still can play. Not saying that Eli can't play, but he's definitely not the same quarterback he once was.\n\nBrady, Ben Roethlisberger, Philip Rivers, Manning and Brees are all over the age of 35. Now there's the youth movement with Mahomes, Watson and Goff. Who is in the best position to win a Super Bowl right now: Proven champions in guys like Brady, Brees and Roethlisberger, or a young guy like Goff, Watson or Mahomes?\n\nNever count out the Patriots: Tom Brady, seen here in Monday's win against the Bills, is still delivering at age 41.\n\nI'm going to have to go with experience. Add (34-year-old) Aaron Rogers in there. You take Aaron Rogers, Brees, Brady, Roethlisberger -- all those guys are proven. They played on the big stage before. I know what they can do.\n\nYes, Goff is very talented. So are Mahomes and Watson, but I have no idea how they're going to respond in a big game, like an AFC championship or NFC championship game to go to a Super Bowl.\n\nThat's still to be determined with those guys -- not saying that they can't do it, but I always lean to the guys who have been there. I think they have a proven track record that they know how to get it done when it matters the most.\n\nWhat do you think is going to happen to Baker Mayfield now that his offensive coordinator Todd Haley and offensive-minded head coach Hue Jackson are now gone?\n\nI think the next coaching hire is key to his success. I think he's a great talent, and he's shown flashes of what he can do. But bringing in the right coach, that offensive-minded coach that caters to his skill set and really works with him developing him into an NFL quarterback, I think that's key for Mayfield.\n\nThe talent is there. It's just the dysfunction. You don't really need that around your young rookie quarterback.", "New York (CNN Business) Starbucks is giving the people what they say they want: Red and green holiday cups.\n\nOn Thursday, the company unveiled four new holiday cup designs: One with red stripes, one with a green argyle pattern, one with red and white flames and one with mistletoe-like coffee cherries in red and green.\n\nStarbucks has been introducing new holiday cups each fall since 1997. Some of the designs have been polarizing, sparking debate about whether the cups are Christmasy enough. This year, Starbucks is leaning into the holiday.\n\n\"We listened to our customers,\" said Roz Brewer, Starbucks' chief operating officer. They said they \"loved the tradition of Christmas,\" she added.\n\nStarbucks ( SBUX ) figured out what customers wanted in a few different ways, Brewer said.

Robots can now perform complicated movements with elegance -- back-flipping , practicing parkour moves, even \" carving\" classical sculptures.\n\nThen there's Sophia, a robot whose widespread appeal lies not in big, dramatic actions (her torso is often fixed to a rolling base), but rather an unsettling human-like appearance, compounded with the complex ability to express emotions.\n\n\"We're not fully there yet, but Sophia can represent a number of emotional states, and she can also see emotional expressions on a human face as well,\" explains David Hanson, the founder of Hanson Robotics.\n\nThe firm has developed a number of Sophias at their small research and design laboratory in Hong Kong, where parts and pieces of Sophia 20, 21 and 22 remain strewn across the facility.\n\nMeet Sophia: The robot who smiles and frowns just like us\n\nAccording to Hanson, Sophia now has simulations of every major muscle in the human face, allowing her to generate expressions of joy, grief, curiosity, confusion, contemplation, sorrow, frustration, among other feelings.\n\n\"In some of the work we're doing, she will see your expressions and sort of match a little bit and also try to understand in her own way, what it is you might be feeling,\" says Hanson.\n\nNew technologies have enabled Sophia, a robot developed by Hanson Robotics, to generate an astounding number of human-like facial expressions. Credit: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBesides deep learning and a pre-programmed set of expressions, Sophia's face is constructed using the latest developments in material technology, meaning it appears softer, more supple and therefore, more realistic. The lab also studies the neurobiology and biology of human facial expressions to help inform how mechanical ones can behave.\n\n\"She is a tool for science in studying human to human interaction, and she's now a platform for allowing AI to express natural-like human emotional state(s), which is something we're developing. True emotive AI,\" says Hanson.\n\nUniversal appeal\n\nWhen Hanson first began sculpting Sophia, he wanted her form to resonate with people from around the world. To that end, he looked to old statues of Nefertiti, ancient Chinese paintings, Audrey Hepburn and even his wife as inspiration. But he also wanted to maintain something of a robot sensibility, too.\n\n\"It was very important that she represent this intersection of humanity and technology, with the intuitive idea that technology can enhance humanity, help us actualize to higher states of being,\" says Hanson.\n\n\"At the same time, (technology can) provoke these questions: What does it mean to be human? What is real, what isn't real? What is the reality of our future which does not yet exist?\"\n\nSophia on stage at the RISE Technology conference in Hong Kong.

During an event at Shanghai Fashion Weekend, Sophia wore 3-D copper arm cuffs and sculptural garments designed by British artist Sadie Clayton.\n\n\"The reason I was interested in working with Sophia is because being an artist, it fuses fashion, art and technology. This was the most natural, organic way of me developing my process,\" says Clayton.\n\n\"I think she is so stunning in her right.

People are not going to settle here permanently,\" Dutton said during an interview with Sky News Australia's David Speers.\n\nWhile the government has declared its policy a success after a sharp drop in boat arrivals, human rights activists say hundreds of refugees -- including children -- have been traumatized by the ordeal.\n\nIn recent months, pressure has been building on the government to allow the refugees to move to Australia or New Zealand, but Dutton said Thursday repeated the country had no desire to offer the refugees a permanent home.\n\n\"Our desire is to remove people from Manus and Nauru, return them back to their countries of origin,\" he said referring to Australia's two offshore migrant processing centers. \"We have been very clear that people won't settle permanently in Australia and we want the people smugglers to hear that loud and clear.\"\n\nIn Australia by Christmas?\n\nAustralia's top diplomat in the United Kingdom, High Commissioner George Brandis, said earlier in a radio interview that the government expects the remaining children to be transferred by Christmas.\n\nRefugee advocate groups said they welcome moves by the government to transfer the children, but stressed that they need to be removed immediately.\n\n\"On the one had we are ecstatic that publicly the government has committed to getting children off Nauru, but on other hand, we still have concerns about whether or not that will happen, and how quickly that will happen,\" said Jana Favero, Director of Advocacy & Campaigns for the Asylum Seeker Resource Center.\n\nThirty-eight children remain in offshore detention on Nauru, including six toddlers, according to group.\n\nFavero said that 15 children are in critical need of medical attention, five of whom have either attempted suicide or have suicidal thoughts.

This sinister chapter of indefinite offshore refugee detention is a black mark on Australia's record as a civil society and should never be repeated,\" World Vision Australia's Head of Policy and Advocacy, Susan Anderson, said in a statement.\n\nSince the Kids Off Nauru campaign started, children on Nauru have been transferred to Australia in stages.\n\nOver the past week 41 families have been transferred off the island. Since October 15, 135 people have transferred from Nauru, according to the Asylum Seeker Resource Center.\n\nFavero said the majority of those cases have been successful because of a court order or legal intervention, \"not because [the government] has had a change in heart.\" She said that right now, going through the courts is the only pathway to bring children who need medical attention off Nauru.\n\n'Beyond desperate'\n\nPressure has been growing on the Australian government to help the increasingly distressed children held on the island, after a 12-year-old boy was evacuated to hospital in Australia after refusing to eat for weeks.\n\nAt the time, Doctors for Refugees President Barri Phatarfod told CNN that the boy was one of several young children on Nauru whose health was progressively deteriorating.\n\nEarlier this month, Doctors without Borders (MSF) said the situation on Nauru was \"beyond desperate.\"\n\nIn a video posted to the group's website, MSF psychologist Natalia Hverta Perez said, \"Now the children, some of them, they are not eating, they are not drinking, anything, they are just lying on the bed, doing nothing... sometimes their parents have to take them to the hospital to feed them, by needle.\"\n\nThe medical aid agency was ordered to cease operations on the island in early October.\n\nShortly after, a senior doctor who was caring for asylum seekers on Nauru was removed from the island, amid reports she was deported by the local government.\n\nDr Nicole Montana, Australia's senior medical officer on Nauru, tasked with overseeing the detainee's health, left the island in mid-October. Her employer, International Health and Medical Services, said she had been removed from her duties \"for a breach of Regional Processing Center rules.\"\n\nAccording to Australian government statistics from July, almost 200 men and women, as well as a dozen children, are being detained on the tiny island nation.\n\nHowever in early October MSF said there could be as many as 900 refugees and asylum seekers still left on the Pacific island, which is almost 2,800 miles from the Australian mainland.\n\nA 2016 UN report found many cases of \"attempted suicide, self-immolation, acts of self-harm and depression\" among children detained on Nauru.", "(CNN) Imagine walking along the rim of an active volcano or seeing ancient Roman ruins come to life before your eyes.\n\nThese days, you don't necessarily have to imagine.\n\nA wave of new edtech companies are using virtual reality to bring vivid experiences like these to the classroom, with advocates highlighting the technology's ability to inspire and grab the attention of young minds.\n\n\"Kids love to engage with [VR] lessons,\" said Guido Kovalskys, chief executive and co-founder of US-based edtech company Nearpod. \"One minute, they are learning about Roman history, and the next, they are transported to ancient Rome and are exploring the Colosseum.\"\n\nAccording to Nearpod's figures, more than 6 million students in the US and beyond have experienced its VR-based lessons, such as virtual field trips, after it began offering the service two years ago.\n\n\"We see a direct correlation between VR usage and increased engagement by students,\" Kovalskys said. \"Added engagement boosts learning outcomes.\"\n\nBut with access to content still somewhat limited, just how widespread could the technology become, and could it reshape how lessons are taught?\n\nA student tries on a virtual reality headset.\n\nSupplementing not replacing\n\nJeremy Bailenson, a professor of communications at Stanford University and founding director of Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab, has been studying VR since the late 1990s.\n\nHe believes that VR should supplement classroom learning, not replace it. \"It's about using VR to shake it up and frame the other work being done in the regular classroom,\" he said. \"It's about stepping away from the mundane stuff and experiencing something.\n\n\"Learning to conjugate verbs, for example, that's not making the best use of VR. It works just fine on a blackboard. Doing something that requires you to watch but not move, that doesn't really justify the use of VR.\"\n\nIn his latest book, \"Experience on Demand,\" Bailenson explains that VR has the potential to democratize education by bringing travel and educational opportunities to those who otherwise couldn't access them.\n\n\"You can take real world experiences and recreate them in a VR setting,\" he said.\n\nOne Copenhagen-based company plans to use VR to bring the science lab to life for students. Labster's immersive education tools and virtual labs are used in about 150 universities worldwide. Now, it is developing a new VR product range in partnership with Google.\n\n\"VR, over the last 30 years, has become more cost effective, and as a result easier to scale,\" said Maaroof Fakhri, VR product owner at Labster. \"Now, that technology is enabling more interesting educational tools to be developed.\"\n\nLabster has developed more than 70 web-based simulations for science students and is working toward migrating its simulations to VR, as well as creating new ones, to provide a richer experience for learners.\n\nThe company aims to engage students through \"storytelling, narrative and interactive gaming elements,\" Fakhri explained. For example, students learning about DNA can partake in a web-based simulation of a crime scene, hunt for clues and analyze their findings.\n\n\"VR offers a physical feeling of being in the lab, which gives students confidence when they progress to an actual lab environment,\" Fakhri said. \"Students can use it alone, at their own pace, repeat things, make mistakes, try the experiments a few times.\"\n\nEarly stages\n\nAccording to Chian Gong, a principal at Reach Capital, a Palo Alto, California-based venture capital firm that supports education-focused startups (including Nearpod), VR is an area with \"a lot of potential.\"\n\nHowever, it remains \"pretty nascent\" in the classroom, Gong adds. \"That's partly because of access to devices but also because there's a lack of available quality content,\" she said.\n\nExperts are also still trying to understand the impact of VR on children's learning.\n\nChildren use Nearpod VR headsets.\n\nResearch conducted by Bailenson and his team at their Stanford lab in 2008 looked at the potential psychological effects on young children using VR. In some cases, children who experienced swimming with whales in a VR environment developed false memories of having visited SeaWorld in real life.\n\nBailenson believes that concerns about VR use can be addressed in two ways: moderation and supervision. \"I don't just mean supervising the content that kids experience in a VR setting but also supervising the physical space for safety reasons,\" he said.\n\nKovalskys agrees that VR should be used carefully. \"VR is an engaging tool, but within a 35-minute lesson plan, it might only be two or three minutes,\" he said.\n\nAnd although Kovalskys believes that technology can play a greater role in the classrooms of the future, he does not expect a future without teachers. \"Learning is a social experience. It is not only about learning content but learning to deal with others,\" he said. \"Teachers play a really influential role.

Children of undocumented immigrants in the country have long been granted citizenship under that interpretation, but the President and some Republicans on Capitol Hill want to end that.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted that birthright citizenship \"will be ended one way or the other.\" Later in the day, he repeated his claim that he can eliminate birthright citizenship via executive order, although he said his preference would be for Congress to pass legislation.\n\n\"I believe you can have a simple vote in Congress,\" Trump told reporters as he left the White House.\n\nThen he said at a rally in Fort Myers, Florida, on Wednesday night that birthright citizenship has \"created an entire industry of birth tourism, big business, where pregnant mothers travel to America to make their children instant American citizens.\" He called birthright citizenship a \"crazy policy\" that costs \"billions of dollars a year,\" though he provided no proof for his claims.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a critic-turned-ally of the President, said on Tuesday that he plans to introduce legislation in line with Trump's vow of executive action, while Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa, an immigration hardliner who has been rebuked by members of his own party for incendiary comments on immigration and diversity, seized on the President's remarks to promote legislation he has previously introduced to end birthright citizenship as it currently exists.\n\nIt's not likely that any legislation challenging birthright citizenship would pass out of Congress, in part because there's no broad base of support on Capitol Hill in favor of doing so and any effort to challenge the policy would be highly divisive.\n\n\"At this point, it's really a minority within the Republican Party that's advocating for the end of birthright citizenship,\" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \"There have been bills that have been introduced since the early 1990s that would limit or end birthright citizenship, but they have never had enough support to pass even out of committee, much less out of Congress.\"\n\nLegal experts have thrown cold water on Trump's assertion that he could end birthright citizenship via executive order, by arguing that it would take the successful passage of a constitutional amendment to do so -- a very high hurdle to clear, since that would necessitate a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate and ratification by three-fourths of the states.\n\nLegislation like what King has introduced does not attempt to alter the text of the Constitution as it is written, but rather seeks to reinterpret the way a key passage of the 14th Amendment is commonly understood. The bill would restrict birthright citizenship so that children born in the United States to unauthorized immigrants would not automatically be granted citizenship. It currently has 48 cosponsors, all of whom are House Republicans.\n\nMany legal experts believe, however, that efforts to reinterpret the 14th Amendment would not pass constitutional muster.\n\n\"The bill Rep. King is proposing would be unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment,\" said Stephen Vladeck, CNN's Supreme Court analyst and a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"The only way the bill could be upheld is if the Supreme Court reverses itself or if the Constitution is amended.\"\n\nGraham has not yet spelled out the specifics of the legislation he has said he will introduce, though he has indicated in the past that he would support a constitutional amendment.\n\nOn Tuesday, Graham tweeted that he plans \"to introduce legislation along the same lines as the proposed executive order\" from the President. Later on Tuesday, Graham tweeted , \"I will be introducing legislation to deal with the issue of birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants -- in a prospective manner -- as I have always contended it has become a magnet for illegal immigration in modern times.\"\n\nThe senator's office declined to provide any further details about the legislation. CNN has reached out to King's office for comment and has yet to receive a response.\n\nRegardless of whether it would withstand legal scrutiny, legislation challenging birthright citizenship is more of a political messaging tool for now than a serious prospect for passage. However, it is always possible that the President's push to highlight the issue could end up changing the political dynamic on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"The President's stand could create political cover for more people to come out in favor of ending birthright citizenship and we have seen some fringe ideas on immigration come into the mainstream under this presidency,\" Pierce said. \"That said, it would be highly unlikely that any of these proposals would advance in Congress.\"\n\nIn an apparent effort to suggest that efforts to end birthright citizenship have bipartisan support, Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to point out that former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid once railed against birthright citizenship, back in 1993 as a senator from Nevada. Reid later disavowed that position, however.\n\nThe now-retired senator responded to the President on Wednesday by saying, \"I made a mistake\" and that the President is \"profoundly wrong.\"\n\n\"This president wants to destroy not build, to stoke hatred instead of unify. He can tweet whatever he wants while he sits around watching TV, but he is profoundly wrong,\" Reid said in a statement.", "(CNN) House forecast: Democrats will win 225 seats (and the House majority) while Republicans will win just 210 seats. A Democratic win of 202 seats and 262 seats is within the margin of error.\n\nWe're just five days until the midterm elections, and if you've noticed, our forecast hasn't really changed. Democrats are still favored to take back the House, while Republicans are still in control in the fight for the Senate.\n\nThe lack of movement may bore some people, but there's a relatively easy explanation for it: the fundamentals remain the same. That is, the forces driving this midterm aren't shifting.\n\nThere's perhaps no better indicator of the national political environment than this measure, which usually asks voters which party they want to vote for in congressional elections. Democrats held a 7-point advantage six months ago. Three months ago, it was also a 7-point lead for the Democrats. Now? They're up about 8 points.\n\nThis 8-point edge is one of the largest ever for a minority party heading into a midterm election. It's consistent with Democrats doing well enough to take back the House (and perhaps by a sizable margin). It's not, however, big enough for Democrats to overcome the bad Senate map, one in which they already control 26 seats and need to takeover or hold onto seats that are in deep red territory.\n\n2. The President's approval rating: If there's one person who drives midterm elections more than any other, it's the President. The relationship isn't perfect, but when he's popular his party manages to hold the traditional seat losses associated with the President's party to a minimum. When If there's one person who drives midterm elections more than any other, it's the President. The relationship isn't perfect, but when he's popular his party manages to hold the traditional seat losses associated with the President's party to a minimum. When his approval rating is below 50%, his party loses on average more than 35 seats in the House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has remained consistently well below that 50% threshold. His approval rating six months ago was 41%. Three months ago, it was 41%. Today, it stands at 42%. You don't need a statistician to tell you that isn't very good. The only president who had an approval rating this low heading into a midterm whose party still controlled the House after the election was Harry Truman in 1950. Even in that midterm though, his party still lost 29 seats. This year that would be enough to flip the House to the Democrats.\n\nThe good news for Republicans is Trump's approval rating is higher in the red states that will determine control of the Senate. His approval rating in Tennessee, for example, stands at 56%.\n\n3. Enthusiasm: The Republican Party's best hope in this midterm was to overcome bad fundamentals with The Republican Party's best hope in this midterm was to overcome bad fundamentals with strong voter turnout. You might remember that Democrats suffered in 2010 and 2014 because of low voter turnout. It doesn't seem that Republicans will get their wish.\n\nThere's basically no difference between the average pollster's results among all registered voters and those seen as likely to vote in the midterm elections. This has been consistent throughout this year. Back in April , the ABC News/Washington Post found an equal percentage of voters who leaned Democratic and those who leaned Republican who said they were certain they were going to vote. This past month , the two sides were equal again.\n\nThe lack of difference between the registered and likely voter results isn't a big surprise. In midterms past, Democratic turnout tends to come close to equaling Republican turnout with a Republican president. That's very different from when there's a Democratic president, which 2010 and 2014 showed to the Democrats dismay.\n\nOne note of caution: Just because the polling hasn't changed this year, it doesn't mean it's predictive of the outcome. The polling consistently put Democrat Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump, and she didn't win. The chance such an error occurs again for the Republicans is unlikely.\n\nFor now, the fundamentals remain on the Democrats' side.", "But as Election Day draws near, a question looms: Will they vote?\n\nTypical midterm elections tend to draw out an older, whiter electorate and fewer single women than presidential years. But because of the deep disdain for Trump among the younger generation, this midterm cycle appears supercharged by younger voters who were stung by the outcome in 2016, and cognizant that their generation could have made the difference for Hillary Clinton.\n\nStrong turnout within that age group could tip some of the closer House races into the Democratic column.\n\nThere's \"an embarrassment that comes with having not voted, or having not cared about voting in the past,\" said Jessica Cohen, a 30-year-old product manager for a software company in California.\n\n\"(People) are realizing how many consequences there have been since 2016,\" she added.\n\n\"That apathy has gotten us into some serious trouble.\"\n\nNew polling this week confirms that the energy among youth voters on the ground isn't a mirage.\n\nnew poll from Harvard Institute of Politics this week found that 18-to-29-year-olds are far more likely to vote in Tuesday's midterm election than they were in 2010 and 2014. Forty percent of those polled said they would \"definitely vote\" in the midterms.\n\nPresident Trump's job approval rating among those under 30 was 26%. If he runs for re-election in 2020, 59% of those polled said they \"will never\" vote for him.\n\nIn one striking finding, 65% of likely voters in the 18-to-29 age group said they were more fearful than hopeful about the future. Immigration and refugees topped the list of concerns, followed by jobs, President Trump (or leadership issues), and health care.\n\nThe energy among the younger generation has also resulted in a crop of candidates in their late 20s and early 30s.\n\nOne of those candidates is 31-year-old Katie Hill, the Democrat running in California's 25th District against incumbent Republican Rep. Steve Knight. Clinton won this district in 2016.\n\nHill is one of the youngest Congressional candidates running this November, along with Abby Finkenauer in Iowa's First District, and Lauren Underwood in Illinois's 14th District.\n\nEvery weekend morning in recent months, dozens of young voters have shown up at Hill's campaign headquarters in Santa Clarita. The office is wedged in a strip mall between a gun armory and a vape shop, underscoring the political diversity of this partly-suburban, partly-rural district north of Los Angeles.\n\nThe line of canvassers spilling out the door is decidedly youthful: Echo Park hipsters, Berniacs sporting 2020 T-Shirts, athletic young moms pushing jogging strollers, and large contingents of USC and UCLA students who are competing over who can make the most voter contacts in California's competitive House districts.\n\nHill, a first-time candidate who filmed one of her campaign commercials while free-climbing a hundred-foot rock wall in nearby Texas Canyon, blends in easily in her purple campaign T-shirt and aqua skinny jeans.\n\nBut she steps up on the staircase to rally this fresh crop of doorknockers, warning that national Republican groups are pouring last-minute money into the race because it is polling within the margin of error.\n\n\"You can tell people when you're knocking on those doors that this election could come down to a few hundred votes,\" Hill tells the group as they ready the lists on their clipboards. \"So their vote really will matter more in this election than probably any election that they'll ever vote in - and that there's no path to flipping the House and holding Donald Trump accountable or making any real progress across the country if we don't flip this seat.\"\n\nAt Hill's headquarters, 30-year-old Caitlin Carlson said she was relieved that people in her generation finally \"want to step up and do something.\"\n\n\"We have been coasting a little bit. We just always kind of assumed that things would work out,\" Carlson said. \"Taking the House back is the first step to getting our country back on the rails. It just feels like we're on this crazy train right now where logic and facts don't matter.\"\n\nShe views Tuesday's election as \"the first real big test for millennials to have faith that the system works.\"\n\nNationally, Democrats have engaged in a forceful effort this fall to convince younger voters that flipping control of the US House could serve as a check on Trump administration policies that they don't agree with.\n\nThey have enlisted many of the potential 2020 Democratic candidates -- including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris -- to deliver that message.\n\nOn Friday night in Oceanside, Sanders drew hundreds of cheering, foot-stomping young fans to a rally organized by California Young Democrats for down ballot candidates, including Mike Levin, the Democrat who is vying for the open seat of retiring Republican Congressman Darrell Issa in Orange and San Diego counties.\n\nLevin, an environmental attorney, delivered an even more pointed message than Sanders -- telling the crowd that the 2018 midterm election will be \"won or lost\" by people between the ages of 18 and 35.\n\n\"In 2016, 31 million voters in that age group, all very much eligible to vote, decided not to,\" Levin told the rally crowd gathered in a gymnasium. \"The result was Donald Trump -- and Charlottesville, and a tax cut designed to benefit the wealthiest 1% of Americans, and Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\" (Kavanaugh's name alone drew the loudest boos of the night).\n\n\"You stay home on Election Day, and Republicans stay in charge,\" Levin continued. \"Your healthcare gets taken away, your student loans become more impossible to pay off, and places like Pulse (the nightclub in Orlando) and Parkland are joined by many more preventable tragedies.\"\n\nChristina Ruiz, a 31-year-old in the crowd who came to see Sanders, said she had just sent in her ballot - the first she has ever cast in a midterm election.\n\n\"My friends are way more involved in voting now,\" said Ruiz, a single mom who tutors at MiraCosta College where the rally was being held. \"Even in the midterms. I never really remember them posting about them, and now they're on Facebook every day talking about it.\"\n\nWhen Ruiz thinks about Democrats retaking the House, she said she hopes they will advance Sanders' agenda for universal health care and free college tuition.\n\n\"That's still a pipe dream, but it's something that we're moving towards,\" Ruiz said.\n\nShe also believes divided government could force more compromise and bring more unity to America. \"Right now there's so much polarization going on. I feel it; I feel it even at school.... Before people were always Democrats or Republicans or something else, but you didn't have that hatred. Now it's like you're afraid to talk about politics, even with people in your own family.\"\n\nPerhaps no one has more faith in the power of the youth vote this cycle than Hill herself.\n\nThe former head of a non-profit that was focused on the region's homeless crisis, Hill often reminds her audiences that she never expected to fill this role -- but decided she needed to step up if her perspective was going to be heard.\n\n\"We have to turn out young people, and I believe that we can this time,\" Hill said in an interview. \"I had so many people tell me that's a losing strategy, and I just don't believe that's true. This is a campaign, and this is a moment in history, when people are going to show up.\"\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correctly attribute quotes to Christina Ruiz.", "London (CNN Business) 1.

If there was any animal that stood out in terms of it being malnourished, and it not being taken care of, it was the camel,\" Sawyerr told CNN.\n\nThe zoo's deputy director of wildlife, Aminu Muhammed, denied Sawyerr's allegation that the camel was malnourished.\n\n\"The camel about some months ago was down with a heavy skin infection and was very lean. So we had to collect a fecal sample, blood sample, and equally even scrape some of the skin to determine which medicine we can use to treat the skin disease and we had done that,\" he told CNN.\n\nBut Sawyerr who went to the zoo with his three-year-old daughter, said his daughter was unable to identify the camel.\n\n\"She knows what a camel looks like on TV, a deer, a donkey, and a monkey,\" he said. \"She was able to recognize all of them apart from the camel.\"\n\nHe posted the picture of the animal on Twitter with the caption \"saw this former camel at the Abuja zoo.\" The post quickly went viral.\n\nSaw this former camel at the Abuja Zoo. pic.twitter.com/PuNcKs2kXq \u2014 Sawyerr (@MrSawyerr) October 27, 2018\n\nThe zoo's deputy director Muhammed said that the heavy rains affected the camel's health but the zoo has given the animal adequate medical attention.\n\n\"The camel is an albino camel. They are desert animals and it's just a young one, so it's just trying to acclimatize that's why it comes down with that (skin infection),\" Muhammed said, adding that animals at the zoo undergo regular checkup every three months.\n\nHe, however, admitted that the park needed more funds to take care of the animals.\n\n\"We (the zoo) really need to improve some of our structures... we equally need to bring in more animals to attract more visitors.\" Muhammed told CNN.\n\nJon Justin Williamson, the lead investigative officer at the International Animal Rescue Foundation Africa disagrees with the zoo's authorities.\n\n\"That camel has more than a skin infection, sadly,\" said the environmental and botanical scientist.\n\n\"This is a dromedary, a juvenile Arabian camel, which I can see is very sick and very malnourished. There's little suitable food on the ground for the animal to even graze on, which unfortunately will eventually lead to its slow and painful death,\" Williamson told CNN.\n\nArabian camels need a varied diet of salt bushes, grass, shrubs, acacia to thrive, otherwise, they die, he added.\n\nThe size of the camel's \"small hump\" showed it had suffered some food deprivation.\n\n\"Camels will store fats which is fibrous tissue in their hump which acts as a reserve food store, meaning if there is little food on the ground, they'll then revert to the hump, pretty much how we humans do,\"

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "(CNN) A Tennessee man who murdered two people in 1984 was executed Thursday, becoming the first inmate in the United States in five years to die in an electric chair.\n\nEdmund Zagorski, 63, had two last words: \"Let's rock.\"\n\nReporter Adam Tamburin, with the Tennessean newspaper, described Zagorski as having a grin on his face at one time, until a sponge and helmet were put over his face. He said Zagorski then grimaced.\n\nJason Lamb, a reporter with CNN affiliate WTVF , said that Zagorski wore white prison trousers and a yellow shirt. He seemed to wave or raise his left hand as he was prepared for electrocution, including after a black cloth shroud was put over his face, Lamb said.\n\nRelatives of the two men Zagorski killed attended the execution. They chose not to speak to the media.\n\nZagorski was pronounced dead at 8:26 p.m. ET. His last-day appeal to the US Supreme Court was denied.\n\nWhy is the electric chair an option?\n\nNine states have death by electric chair as an alternative to lethal injection. In 2014, Tennessee became the first state to make use of the electric chair mandatory when lethal injection drugs are unavailable.\n\nBy Tennessee law, any person convicted of a capital offense before January 1, 1999 may choose electrocution.\n\nZagorski began his sentence in March 1984 and the state's prosecutors had argued \"the statute also gives the Tennessee Department of Correction the authority to promulgate rules to carry out the election (of electrocution instead of lethal injection).\"\n\nTennessee has used the electric chair only once since 1960.\n\nDaryl Holton, who killed his three young sons and his ex-wife's daughter, chose the electric chair in 2007.\n\nBefore Holton's execution, Tennessee had not used the electric chair in 47 years.\n\nThe electrocution protocol is practiced monthly by the execution team, and public records indicate the chair was tested in February, the Tennessean newspaper reported.\n\nAfter Zagorski chose the electric chair, Gov. Bill Haslam issued a reprieve of 10 days to prepare for the execution.\n\n\"[T]his brief reprieve will give all involved the time necessary to carry out the sentence in an orderly and careful manner,\" the governor said in a statement.\n\nZagorski's electrocution was the first in the US since 2013, when Virginia killed a man who murdered two people.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

En su momento se consider\u00f3 devastador para la campa\u00f1a de Dukakis.\n\nEl anuncio de Trump, aunque igual de impactante que el promocional de Horton, tiene mayor peso ya que, a diferencia de su predecesor de 1988, cuenta con el respaldo oficial del l\u00edder del Partido Republicano - Trump - y no es un esfuerzo independiente. Dado que Trump ayud\u00f3 a distribuirlo desde su cuenta de Twitter, tambi\u00e9n cuenta con todo el significado simb\u00f3lico de la misma presidencia.\n\nEn una primera reacci\u00f3n, el presidente del Comit\u00e9 Nacional Dem\u00f3crata Tom Perez dijo que el anuncio era una se\u00f1al de desesperaci\u00f3n y sugiri\u00f3 que Trump estaba perdiendo la discusi\u00f3n sobre el sistema de salud que est\u00e1 en el centro de la campa\u00f1a dem\u00f3crata.\n\n\"Este es el Donald distractor y divisivo en su peor faceta\", dijo Perez en el programa \"Cuomo Prime Time\" de CNN.\n\n\"Esto se trata de infundir temor...

The number of illnesses has risen from 18 cases, including six deaths, announced last week by the health department.\n\n\"They range in age from toddlers to young adults,\" New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal said last week. \"Some have been hospitalized, and some are being cared for at this facility.\"\n\nA staff member was also affected by the outbreak but has recovered.\n\nThe health department also announced Wednesday that four cases of adenovirus were found among kids at a second New Jersey facility, Voorhees Pediatric Facility. However, preliminary tests suggest that it's a different strain than the one in Wanaque, and these patients are not in critical condition.\n\nHealth officials say they are stepping up efforts to strengthen infection control at such facilities in the state. On Monday, the health department announced plans to deploy a team of infection control experts this month to visit University Hospital and four pediatric long-term care facilities, including the Wanaque and Voorhees facilities, where experts will train staff and evaluate how these facilities prevent and control infections.\n\n\"Facility outbreaks are not always preventable, but in response to what we have seen in Wanaque, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the chance they occur among the most vulnerable patients in New Jersey,\" Elnahal said in a statement Monday.\n\nAdenoviruses are often spread by touching a contaminated person or surface, or through the air by coughing or sneezing. They are known to persist on unclean surfaces and medical instruments for long periods of time, and they may not be eliminated by common disinfectants, but they rarely cause severe illness in healthy people. However, people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk for severe disease, and they may remain contagious long after they recover, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSymptoms may appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus, the state health department said.\n\nThe outbreak in the Wanaque facility was caused by adenovirus type 7. This type is \"most commonly associated with acute respiratory disease,\" the CDC says. Other types of adenovirus infections can cause flu-like symptoms, pinkeye and diarrhea.\n\n\"We are working every day to ensure all infection control protocols are continuously followed and closely monitoring the situation at the facility,\" Elnahal said.\n\nCould more have been done?\n\nThe Wanaque outbreak was caused by an adenovirus strain known to affect \"communal living arrangements,\" according to the state health department -- but some wonder whether more could have been done to prevent this, according to former employees and the mother of one child who died as a result of the outbreak.\n\n\"I'm upset that the kids I took care of -- that were all getting better and getting stronger and learning to walk -- are now dead,\" said Javier Guzman, who worked at the Wanaque facility for nearly five years as a recreational assistant until March 2017, when he said multiple staffers were let go.\n\n\"They were such beautiful, happy little children. They may have had compromised immune systems, but they led normal children lives. All they wanted to do was play and sing and clap,\" Guzman said.\n\nFormer employees said it came as a shock to hear about deaths among young residents at the facility. In some cases, former employees described a facility in need of maintenance, as well as cleaning and infection control practices that appeared to be lacking -- including an air filter that needed cleaning, a leaky ceiling and an ice machine collecting what appeared to be mold. The former employees said these issues were reported to management.\n\nHowever, another former employee, who requested not to be named and left the facility to pursue another career, said she had a positive experience at the Wanaque Center, whose maintenance staff she generally found to be responsive. She said she believes that the facility met industry standards but, speaking more generally, that those standards might be too low across an industry she described as chronically understaffed and underpaid.\n\nThe facility did not respond to CNN's questions about comments made by former employees.\n\nNurses at the facility had reported a shortage of nursing staff and supplies, according to a statement last week from the union that represents the nursing staff. The Health Professionals and Allied Employees said the shortages may have led to \"poor infection control practices.\"\n\nThe union said it represents 70 nurses who work at the Wanaque Center.\n\nOn Tuesday, state health officials released the complete findings of an unannounced inspection conducted on October 21 -- after they had been alerted by the facility and before the health department publicly announced the deaths. Inspectors found deficient hand hygiene in four of six staffers observed but noted that the facility followed a number of measures in line with existing recommendations, such as having protective equipment outside rooms and posting signs with adenovirus precautions.\n\n\"Now that the report is finalized, certain findings raise questions about whether these general longterm care standards are optimal for this vulnerable population of medically fragile children,\" Elnahal said in a statement . The statement added that federal regulations will require an \"on-site infection preventionist\" at places like the Wanaque Center starting in November 2019. \"We also need to think about whether there is more we can do as healthcare leaders to protect immunocompromised children, such as those served at Wanaque Center,\" he said.\n\n\"Every year in the state, there are hundreds of outbreaks at healthcare facilities,\" Elnahal added.\n\nIn a review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Wanaque Center was awarded an above-average ranking in overall quality but a below-average health inspection rating. The rating is based on two years of inspections before November 2017.\n\nThe facility has received and corrected other deficiencies. Based on an inspection conducted in August , CMS reported that \"it was determined that the facility failed to provide a clean and homelike physical environment for their residents.\" The review found carpeted areas that \"smelled of old carpet and mildew.\"\n\nLast week, health department commissioner Elnahal described these as \"low-level, self-limited deficiences\" that were resolved when health inspectors rechecked.\n\nMay 2017 inspection report \"determined that the facility failed to ensure infection control practices were followed.\" Among the deficiencies cited were improperly stored syringes, which were used to measure liquid medication, and over-bed tables and medication trays that were not properly cleaned and disinfected. The deficiencies were listed as corrected a month later and were lower in number than the US average.\n\nNationwide, infection control has \"become a more pressing concern\" in recent years and has consistently been among the most common citations for nursing homes, topping the list from 2010 to 2014, according to a 2015 CMS report.\n\n\"It is rare that in any inspection a facility would come out with no citations,\" Elnahal said. \"If it's a number of citations, all of which are low-level, we ask for a plan of correction. We make sure the facility follows through -- and that's what this facility did here.\n\n\"If the findings are severe enough to take further action, we will,\" he added.\n\nChristopher Podmayersky, a former activities assistant at the facility, said \"I was there for almost seven full years, and nothing ever like this happened.\n\n\"It's just heartbreaking because I feel like this could have been prevented,\" he said.\n\n'She's gone'\n\n\"She's gone,\" Kristine Poulos, whose 16-year-old daughter was among the deaths at the Wanaque facility, told CNN affiliate WABC. \"I can't bring her back. She's not coming back.\"\n\nPoulos' daughter, who had required breathing and feeding tubes as part of her normal care, was transferred to a hospital with a fever but was transferred back to the Wanaque facility, where she died last week, according to WABC.\n\nAlthough the complete timeline of deaths at the facility remains unclear, the Wanaque facility said it \"promptly notified all appropriate government agencies when the virus was initially identified.\" According to health department spokeswoman Nicole Kirgan, state health officials were notified of respiratory illness at the facility on October 9, and the facility notified parents 10 days later, on October 19.\n\nPoulos told WABC that her daughter Elizabeth had been diagnosed with adenovirus at least five days before state health officials were notified. \"Why wouldn't you report it sooner?\" she asked.\n\n\"We are working side-by-side with medical experts from the Department of Health and the CDC, and will be in constant contact with them until this issue is fully resolved,\" the facility said in a statement last week. The statement added that staff \"feel a tremendous sense of loss\" and are taking steps to improve safety and comfort, including offering grief counseling and a 24/7 hotline for those affected.\n\nThe facility has not responded to calls and emails for further comment. The facility has been \"instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends and they are in full compliance,\" according to the state health department. State health officials have said the outbreak can be declared over only once four weeks pass without an additional case.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHealth experts say that the amount of time it takes to respond to a potential outbreak and notify families is variable and may depend on how long they need to investigate an outbreak, culture a virus and confirm its identity.\n\nAccording to Elnahal, \"It can be difficult to impossible to know how the virus got to the facility, what its source was, or what its specific mechanism of spread is from person to person.\"\n\nBut Poulos told WABC, \"I just want to know what happened.\"", "02:33\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \"\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647\u0627\" \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629.. \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a\u061f", "(CNN) The UK government is getting tough on dirty money.\n\nThe new Serious and Organised Crime, or SOC, strategy is set to be published Thursday and includes a pledge of \u00a348 million ($61.3 million) for 2019/20 designed to target \"illicit finance\" that drives the networks behind organized crime.\n\nThe National Crime Agency, known as NCA and often dubbed Britain's version of the FBI, estimates 4,600 organized crime groups operate in the UK, using violence and intimidation as they prey on vulnerable members of society, \"from victims of modern slavery and human trafficking to young people suffering sexual exploitation and abuse.\"\n\nBen Wallace, the UK's minister for security and economic crime, will speak in central London on Thursday morning to outline how the government's plan will build upon existing law enforcement capabilities.\n\n\"Sharp suits swan around the nation's capital, while all along they head up networks that covertly trade millions of pounds in financial transactions online.

Hide Caption 9 of 9\n\nKashmir's Barcelona\n\nIt wasn't just floods blighting the region.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have been fighting over Kashmir since both countries gained independence in 1947.\n\nSeveral domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have clashed with Indian security forces in recent years and tourists are generally wary of visiting the area.\n\nAs a way of changing perceptions, Chattoo and Meraj began to seriously think about setting up an official team. Soon they were co-owners of a football club.\n\n\"We wanted to create something for Kashmir that would mean the same as what Manchester United means to the UK and what Barcelona means to Spain,\" Chattoo said.\n\nFloods damaged much of Kashmir in 2014.\n\nThe two friends set up basic training sessions for the local community, initially just for fun.\n\nBut as the sessions grew in popularity, they felt ready to enter a team into local tournaments.\n\nThe amateur club began to attract better and more experienced players and were eventually persuaded to turn professional.\n\nIt entered I-League's 2nd division for the 2016-17 season and went on to win the league in the following year -- securing promotion to the I-League.\n\nThe nationwide division shares top-flight status with the Indian Super League (ISL), with the eventual winner qualifying for the Asian Champions League (AFC).\n\n'I had never been to India'\n\nThe club's rise also has a lot to do with current manager David Robertson, who is credited with instilling an atmosphere of professionalism.\n\n\"There was this notion that if you weren't playing for Real Madrid or Barcelona, you weren't professional players. We've managed to change that now,\" said the manager.\n\nRobertson had a successful playing career in Britain but moved to Kashmir in January 2017, following 10 years coaching in the US.\n\nAn agent had offered the Scot three opportunities. One in China, one in Uganda and the Kashmir job. The rest is history.\n\nScottish coach David Robertson took over at Real Kashmir in January 2017.\n\nThe side has had to cope with a lack of professional facilities.\n\n\"I had never been to India, I had no idea about Kashmir, nothing about Indian football. But what appealed was the fact it was a new club,\" said the former Rangers and Leeds United player.\n\n\"You had no idea how far it could go, what the potential was and it gave me something to stamp my mark on and help a good cause.\"\n\nHis transition to rural India wasn't easy as he grappled with no internet, a lot of snow and plenty of power cuts.\n\n\"I wanted to go home but I was persuaded to stay. I'm glad I did because it's been the greatest two years of football I've had,\" Robertson said.\n\nLife as Real Kashmir's manager comes with a unique set of challenges. The club still shares the training ground with other local teams and Robertson often doesn't know what time they'll be training on the artificial surface.\n\nDeveloping facilities at their Srinagar-based complex is certainly a top priority for both the manager and owners.\n\nThe club hopes to improve facilities in the local community this season.\n\nAdidas deal\n\nPromotion to India's I-League was accompanied by a real coup when German sportswear giant Adidas announced it was partnering with the club ahead of the new season.\n\nThe global brand will be the team's official kit sponsor for the 2018-19 season and has already helped \"redefine\" the club.\n\n\"Through sport, we have the power to change lives and the Real Kashmir team is a great example of this,\" said Dave Thomas, Managing Director of Adidas India.\n\n\"Real Kashmir and its players have shown dedication and perseverance under difficult circumstances and we are proud to support them as they create history.\"\n\nChattoo hopes the deal will help encourage the region's youth to participate more in sports and has already seen a positive change in the valley.\n\n\"We have seen a lot of excitement about the partnership already, there is a great buzz in Kashmir and all over India,\" Chattoo told CNN.\n\n'Everyone has a reason to smile'\n\nMeanwhile, Robertson has witnessed the club's fan base grow from virtually nothing in his short time in India. He hopes the media attention and televising of games will see that growth continue.\n\nHe believes his players, which include his own son Mason, can deal with the step up in quality this season and has urged them to use the local community's enthusiasm for the club's project as motivation.\n\n\"We want to preserve our status and become an established team in the I-League.

En vida, el neandertal masculino, conocido como Kebara 2 o K2, med\u00eda aproximadamente 1,67 metros de altura y pesaba 75,3 kilos.

In comparison, the estimate of the last IPCC assessment report would correspond to a warming of only 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) every decade.\"\n\nLaurent Bopp, a co-author of the study from the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, told CNN the findings were \"bad news for the ocean itself, bad news for the ecosystem.\"\n\nBecause the circulation of water in the deep oceans is very slow, the heat that has been absorbed will remain there for a very long time, Bopp said, likely centuries rather than decades.\n\n\"Climate change is not only about the next decades to the end of the century. It will affect the earth for centuries and millennia after that,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED If coral reefs disappear, so will they Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH If coral reefs disappear, so will they 06:08\n\nThe findings come weeks after a dire report from the United Nations warned that humanity has just over 10 years to act to avoid disastrous levels of global warming, urging governments to make \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\"\n\nThe UN report found that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nPlanet 'more sensitive' than thought\n\nThe study by Resplandy and fellow scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego and Princeton University is significant because it shows the Earth's climate on the whole is probably retaining more heat than previously thought.\n\nPart of the big question in estimating how much the planet will warm in the future is understanding how sensitive the planet is to carbon emissions, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.\n\nThis study reveals that a lot of the heat that was thought to be escaping to space is actually being absorbed in the ocean -- and means the planet is more sensitive to carbon emissions then was thought, he said.\n\nAs a result, estimates for sea level rise, sea ice melting and coral reefs dying are likely going to be on the worse ends of the ranges scientists thought were possible. If oceans rise faster than forecast, that represents more of an immediate threat to low-lying communities.\n\nThe UN report used the old assumptions for heat absorbed in the ocean, Miller added. If further research corroborates the findings of the latest study, those calculations would need to be redone and the forecast would be more dire.\n\nOxygen, carbon dioxide measured\n\nThe researchers found that the oceans have taken in 13 zettajoules of heat energy each year between 1991 and 2016. That's believed to be 150 times the amount of energy humans produce as electricity annually, according to the Princeton news release.\n\nA zettajoule is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. To put that in context, a 100-watt light bulb emits 100 joules per second.\n\nRather than using temperature-based estimates from a network of drifting floats , with complete data going back only to 2007, the researchers used precise measurements of atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide between 1991 and 2016 to produce an independent estimate of ocean heat uptake over that period.\n\nThis approach relies on the fact that as waters get warmer, they release more carbon dioxide and oxygen into the air. Precise measurements of atmospheric oxygen began in 1991 and carbon dioxide in 1958, allowing the researchers to draw on nearly three decades of data.\n\nThe result, the paper's authors said, \"suggests that ocean warming is at the high end of previous estimates, with implications for policy-relevant measurements of the Earth response to climate change, such as climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and the thermal component of sea-level rise.\"\n\nThe study was funded by NOAA's Climate Program Office and the Princeton Environmental Institute.", "Seoul (CNN) The South Korean Supreme Court ruled in favor of conscientious objectors Thursday, ending the country's decades-long position as the world's leading jailer of those who refuse to join the armed forces.\n\n\"Refusing to enter the military due to a religious faith which forbids bearing arms is considered a justified reason to refuse duty,\" the court said in its ruling. \"Therefore it cannot be criminally punished.\"\n\nIn overturning a ruling by a lower court to sentence a conscientious objector to 18 months in prison, it said jailing him \"excessively limited his freedom of conscience\" and threatened the essential protections of the country's constitution. The case has now been returned to the Changwon District Court.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, a minority of judges said the ruling interfered with an issue of national policy \"which should be solved via adoption of alternative service law\" decided by the legislature.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling comes on the back of a decades-long fight by conscientious objectors, many of them Jehova's Witnesses, to push back against the country's stringent military service law, under which all men between the ages of 18 and 35 are required to perform at least 21 months of military service.\n\nRead More",

other men involved in the study were also able to regain control of their leg muscles after they were implanted with electrical stimulators that could help compensate for the damage to their spinal cords, according to new research published in the journal Nature\n\nThe spinal cord carries messages from the brain to other parts of the body, allowing us to move our limbs, feel sensations like pressure or temperature, and control vital functions.\n\nIf it is damaged, the neural signals can have trouble getting through, leaving a person paralyzed or otherwise disabled. In this experiment, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne used electrical implants to bridge the gap in the spinal cord, helping to carry the messages from the brain across the damaged area into a non-damaged part of the spinal cord lower down.\n\nThe effects of the treatment lasted beyond when the electrical signals stopped, and \"all of the participants retained some improvement in muscle movement even after the stimulation therapy,\" according to Nature\n\nWhile the results were astonishing, the team was quick to caution that the treatment -- called epidural electrical stimulation -- is in the early stages and it is not clear for how many people this would work. Importantly, the current sample size was very small, and all involved in the study retained some level of motor function below their injuries, even if this was not enough to walk unaided.\n\nOne positive sign about the study is that the electrical stimulation was not simply moving the muscles by itself, in the way that sending current through a dead body will make it twitch, but that it relied on the subjects attempting to move their limbs.\n\n\"It really works as an amplifier,\" study lead Gr\u00e9goire Courtine told Nature. \"It's not that we're taking over control of the leg. The patients -- they have to do it.\"\n\nHe said that after two days, the new movement became almost natural to the subjects and within a week, they were able to walk with limited assistance. This included one person previously had no movement in his legs, and one whose left leg had been completely paralyzed, according to Nature.\n\n\"Not so long ago, the hope that someone paralyzed for years by a severe spinal-cord injury would ever be able to walk again was just that -- hope,\" the journal said in an editorial about the new research . \"But recent advances are bringing those hopes closer to reality.\"\n\nIn a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September, researchers at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center at the University of Louisville described how two of four patients with \"motor complete spinal cord injury\" -- meaning no voluntary movement below their injury -- were able to walk again after being implanted with a spinal cord stimulation device and then undergoing extensive physical therapy. They walk with the aid of walkers.\n\n\"This should change our thinking about people with paralysis,\" said Susan Harkema, one of the lead researchers of that study who is a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville when that study was published . \"It's phenomenal. This new knowledge is giving us the tools to develop new strategies and tools for recovery in people with chronic spinal injuries.\"\n\nAnother study also published in September in the journal Nature Medicine unveiled similar results. A man paralyzed since 2013 regained his ability to stand and walk with assistance due to spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy, according to research done in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\"What this is teaching us is that those networks of neurons below a spinal cord injury still can function after paralysis,\" Dr. Kendall Lee, the co-principal investigator and director of Mayo Clinic's Neural Engineering Laboratories, said in a press release when the study was released.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThese studies provide important additional evidence to the continued advances being made in the spinal cord injury field Monica Perez, a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami said previously . She said it shows more proof that people with severe paralysis often have residual connections that \"can be engaged in a functionally relevant manner -- and that's amazing.\"\n\nPatients like David M'zee who took part in the new study. The 30-year-old Swiss man was told by doctors he would never walk again after a sporting accident. Now he's able to walk around half a mile with the implant turned on.", "Hong Kong and New York (CNN Business) Google employees around the world staged walkouts on Thursday to protest what they say is a workplace culture that has turned a blind eye to sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\nThe demonstrations, dubbed \"Google Walkout,\" follow an outcry over a New York Times investigation that detailed years of sexual harassment allegations, multimillion-dollar severance packages for accused executives, and a lack of transparency over the cases.\n\nGoogle ( GOOGL workers from Tokyo to San Francisco took part in the protests, walking out of their offices at 11:10 a.m. local time.\n\nMore than 1,000 people streamed out of Google's corporate headquarters in Mountain View, California. The group of men and women cheered as the protest started in a courtyard on the company's massive complex.\n\n\"It's just unfair that the women who are being attacked have to speak to the people above them in order to get change to happen,\" said Taylor Reifurth, a freelance editor at Google. \"Because sometimes their abusers are the ones above them and in charge of promoting them or in charge of their jobs. It's a lose-lose situation.\"\n\nIn downtown San Francisco, where Google has five offices, more than 1,000 male and female employees assembled, chanting \"women's rights are worker's rights.\" Some held signs that mocked the payouts given to accused executives. \"Happy to quit for $90 million. No sexual harassment required,\" one read.\n\nOrganizers read a handful of anonymous stories about harassment from Google employees and listed the group's demands into a microphone. When asked how many people had their own stories of harassment that hadn't been told, a number of attendees raised their hands.\n\n\"I said to myself last night, 'I hope that I still have a career in Silicon Valley after this and I hope that whoever I work with won't take it out against me,'\" said Google employee Cathay Bi, who acted as spokesperson for the group.\n\nIn New York City, workers spilled out of the company's Chelsea headquarters, filling a nearby park to capacity and chanting in unison \"Time is up.\" Some held signs reading \"Women's rights are human rights\" and \"C++ Style, No exceptions. Code of conduct, No exceptions!\"\n\nDiana Scholl, who is on the social marketing team at Google's YouTube, was among the protestors. She's been at the company for about six months -- her first five months she was a temporary employee.\n\n\"I think the NYT story was the catalyst but it's been a long time coming,\" she said of the protest.\n\nGoogle employees walk off the job on Thursday in New York.\n\nThe protests started in Asia and continued west through Europe to the United States. About 150 Google employees in India participated in the walkouts, a company spokesman in the country told CNN. Google has about 2,000 staff members across Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.\n\nProtests were also reported at the company's Singapore and Tokyo offices. It was unclear how many people participated but each office has more than 1,000 employees, a spokesman said.\n\nIn Europe, CNN witnessed a small group of Google employees walk out at the company's London headquarters. \"We're walking out in support of those who've been harassed anywhere in the workplace, and to ensure that perpetrators are not rewarded and are not protected,\" said Sam Dutton, a developer advocate at Google.\n\nA larger protest was reported in Zurich, Switzerland. A Twitter account named @googlewalkout posted photos of people at what it said were protests at Google's Singapore, Tokyo, Berlin and Zurich offices.\n\nGoogle staffers walk out in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nGoogle, along with other Silicon Valley companies and tech startups, has been rocked in recent years by allegations of sexual misconduct in the workplace and accusations that the corporate culture has allowed for racial and gender discrimination in hiring, pay and promotions.\n\nThe organizers of the Google protest wrote in an op-ed in New York Magazine they are demanding company leadership take concrete steps, including an end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and \"transparent data on the gender, race and ethnicity compensation gap.\"\n\nFirst #GoogleWalkout photo coming straight from our office in Singapore where it's 11/1 just after 12p! pic.twitter.com/Ctv3xLE0aH \u2014 Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) November 1, 2018\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai has voiced his support for the walkouts.\n\n\"We let Googlers know that we are aware of the activities planned for Thursday and that employees will have the support they need if they wish to participate,\" Pichai said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\"Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\" he said. \"We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\"\n\nAt the San Francisco #GoogleWalkout were people are still streaming in. pic.twitter.com/9THkQRLl3d \u2014 Heather Kelly (@heatherkelly) November 1, 2018\n\nMarc Benioff, the billionaire founder of Salesforce, told CNN Business in an interview he supported women employees at Google who are calling for a sea change at the company. \"I'm with you,\" he said. \"I'm with women who feel that they needed a voice or an advocate for equality.\"\n\nAndroid founder Andy Rubin left Google in 2014. His lawyer says allegations against him of sexual misconduct are false.\n\nIn an email sent shortly after the Times investigation was published last week, Google's management stressed to employees that the company is \"dead serious about making sure we provide a safe and inclusive workplace.\"\n\nAccording to the report, the company stayed silent about sexual misconduct allegations against three executives over the past decade, including Android creator Andy Rubin, who left the company in 2014. Tech news site The Information previously reported that Google had investigated Rubin for an inappropriate relationship while at the company.\n\nBut the Times uncovered new details, including a reported $90 million exit package that Rubin is said to have been granted when he departed the company. The Times reported that Rubin was accused of coercing a female employee, with whom he'd been having affair, into performing oral sex in a hotel room in 2013. A Google investigation found her claim to be credible and then-CEO Larry Page asked Rubin to resign, according to the Times.\n\nSam Singer, a lawyer for Rubin, disputed the allegations in the Times report.\n\n\"None of the allegations made about Mr. Rubin are true,\" he told CNN Business in a statement, calling them \"demonstrably false.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Richard DeVaul, a director of Google X, resigned from his position. The Times report claimed he had sexually harassed a job applicant. DeVaul is leaving without any exit package, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nIn a statement to the Times, DeVaul said he was sorry for the \"error of judgement.\" CNN wasn't able to reach him for comment.", "(CNN) Notorious mob boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger was brutally beaten in the fatal attack Tuesday at the Hazelton prison in Bruceton Mills, according to law enforcement officials.\n\nThe South Boston mobster, 89, died a day after he was transferred there from another facility -- the victim of the kind of brutality he once handed out.\n\nAt the time of the killing, Bulger was in the general prison population, which gave inmates easy access to him, according to a federal law enforcement official, who has knowledge of the investigation.\n\nBulger was found unresponsive at 8:20 a.m., and was pronounced dead after failed lifesaving measures, prison officials said.\n\nInvestigators believe he was attacked by more than one person. At least one of the inmates involved has ties to organized crime in Massachusetts, the official said.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

but statistics reveal the biggest threats are home-grown.", "(CNN) The British government has added cannabis to the pharmacopoeia of medicines available to patients on the National Health Service.\n\nAs of November 1, \"patients can be prescribed medicinal cannabis by specialist doctors,\" the Home Office declared in a recent statement\n\nCampaigners lobbied the government to reconsider its previous stance categorizing cannabis as a Class A substance, defined as having no medicinal or therapeutic value.\n\nPublic mood in the UK shifted alongside highly publicized cases in which epileptic children had their illicit cannabis medications confiscated. But Sajid Javid's appointment as home secretary in April appears to have instigated a change.\n\nAfter the uproar, Javid said in June, \"we completely sympathize with the families who have been facing desperate situations as they try to find treatment.\"\n\nJavid listened to concerns from parents of children with conditions such as severe epilepsy and called for an urgent review of of cannabis-based medicinal products, according to the UK government.\n\nHealth authorities will now author advice for specialist clinicians responsible for prescribing cannabis products.\n\n\"The new law will not limit the types of conditions that can be considered for treatment,\" a Home Office statement reads. Instead, doctors \"must make decisions on prescribing cannabis-based products for medicinal use on a case-by-case basis, and only when the patient has an unmet special clinical need that cannot be met by licensed products.\"\n\nPsychiatrist and government drugs adviser Dr. Derek Tracy highlighted pain, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy as \"obvious early candidates\" for treatment with cannabis.\n\n\"The larger step from a legislative point of view has been taken,\" Tracy said. \"What you might see is some finessing of the law in terms of specific compounds found to be particularly helpful or particularly toxic.\"\n\nTracy sits on the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , whose recommendations the Home Office has accepted almost wholesale. The council's role, he explained, \"is specifically looking at harm.\"\n\n\"Do the drugs harm people? And we know that they can. How often is that? And so forth. The Department of Health will be taking the other side, pushing for the health part; what do we know in terms of benefits?\"\n\nFellow G7 country Germany legalized cannabis-derived medicines in 2017, but some doctors are reluctant to prescribe it, and patients face ongoing supply shortfalls. Many users still turn to illegal means, such as growing their own cannabis, said Sascha Waterkotte, spokesman for the German Hemp Association.\n\n\"Doctors could be made more sensitive towards the law,\" said Waterkotte. \"Germany needs more conferences for doctors, some of which have many prejudices against cannabis being used as medicine or have so far not been involved with this topic.\"\n\n\"I don't think there's a jurisdiction that's got this right yet,\" Tracy said. \"I wouldn't confidently say that Canada or Germany or any other country has done it better than the UK or that we've learnt from huge mistakes; it's too early.\"\n\n'I want my baby to be active and happy'\n\nMahboob Haniffa began campaigning for cannabis legalization with advocacy group Families4Access after learning that the plant may improve his son's condition.\n\nAyub, 5, endured a meconium aspiration at birth, inhaling amniotic fluid into his lungs, which left him with cystic fibrosis, partial blindness and a tube to drain fluid from his cranium. He was diagnosed with epilepsy three years ago.\n\n\"He gets seizures maybe every week,\" Haniffa said, \"and he's on about three medications at the minute to keep his seizures down.\n\n\"I want my baby to be active and happy, not like a vegetable, always sleepy and looking tired.\"\n\nMahboob Haniffa began campaigning for cannabis legalization after learning that the plant may help his son's epilepsy.\n\nOne of the primary components of cannabis, cannabidiol (also known as CBD), has been shown to have an anti-epileptic effect . Users report a significant reduction in the number and frequency of seizures.\n\nNeurophysician Dr. Mike Barnes, who specializes in brain rehabilitation and publicly extols the potential applications for cannabis, says CBD works by interacting with the innate network of endocannabinoid neurotransmitters in the brain.\n\n\"This system has a big role to play in lots of bodily functions, including epilepsy,\" Barnes said. \"What the plants are doing is interacting with our own system, supplementing it, putting it right.\"\n\nEpileptics access a range of anti-seizure drugs through the health service, though for patients like Ayub, with only partial success. Cannabis provides a viable alternative.\n\n\"The reality is, it's incredibly effective,\" Barnes said. \"We have children who have several hundred seizures go down to just a few seizures a week.\"\n\nBut Haniffa is aware that his son, who already balances a regular diet of powerful drugs, needs informed and educated practitioners to prescribe an appropriate dose. The family has refused all offers of obtaining cannabis illegally.\n\n\"If I can use that legally, with trained doctors advising the right dose for him, then we want to try that on him,\" Haniffa said.\n\n\"Ayub is the light in our house. When Ayub is happy, we are happy. And we are fighting to get the right medication.\"\n\n'Trying to be well'\n\nCarly Jayne Barton, 32, campaigns for legal access to cannabis as deputy director of the United Patients Alliance, an advocacy group that states on its website, \"we believe that no one should be criminalized for trying to be well.\"\n\nBarton has a debilitating nerve condition called fibromyalgia, for which she self-medicates with a variety of cannabis products. In 2011, a stroke led to her diagnosis.\n\n\"My whole world just collapsed,\" Barton said. \"My legs stopped working. My limbs were very clumsy. I was in excruciating pain, screaming the house down.\"\n\nDoctors prescribed a variety of opioids to numb her pain. She recalled their advice: \"Tramadol's not working? OK, have morphine. The morphine's not working? OK, have fentanyl. The fentanyl's not working? OK, have more fentanyl.\"\n\nAfter initially refusing cannabis as a potential alternative, Barton succumbed to desperation. \"I smoked a joint one night before bed,\" she said. \"All of the muscle spasms in my body just let go.\n\nCarly Jane Barton has fibromyalgia, for which she self-medicates with a variety of cannabis products.\n\n\"I'd not been able to not feel pain in my body for five years. That point was where I questioned everything I'd ever been told about what medicine is.\"\n\nBarton has since substituted opioids with a daily cannabis routine. She makes cannabis tinctures and balms to rub on her joints and medicates with a handheld vaporizer throughout the day.\n\n\"Given the choice between heroin, morphine and all of these horrible drugs, I think anyone with a chronic pain condition would consider it.\n\n\"This works. This is the reason I can get out of bed in the morning, go and walk my dogs, go and see my friends, run a business.\"\n\nBarnes says cannabis is \"certainly as effective as opiates.\"\n\n\"There are some people like Carly who can actually stop all the opioids they're on,\" he said. \"And it's safer; you can't die from cannabis, but many people in this country die every year from an opioid overdose.\"\n\nStudies published in the US in April show that opioid prescriptions dropped 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws.\n\nBarton's self-medicating remains illegal, however. British police have been notified of the incoming change in regulations, which Barton hopes will encourage leniency, but the criminality of clandestine use remains.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will make the full plant or \"flower\" available on prescription, not merely extracts in pill or liquid form.\n\nBedrocan Nederland, which produces pharmaceutical-grade medicinal cannabis commissioned by the Dutch government, will become the first to market cannabis in the UK.\n\nScientists like Barnes and Tracy hope this legislative change will clear the pathway for more clinical research. Previously, trials had been difficult and circuitous because of prohibitive regulation.\n\n\"The research has been really hampered in the last decades,\" Barnes noted. \"Our knowledge of cannabis is very much lacking.\"", "(CNN) The Taliban have strengthened their grip in Afghanistan over the past three years, according to a new report released by the US government's own ombudsman of the war.\n\nIn its quarterly report for the US Congress, the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said that the Afghan government currently controls or influences only 55.5% of the country's districts, marking the lowest level recorded since SIGAR began tracking district control in November 2015.\n\nTranslated into layman's terms, the report measures \"control\" -- in which one side runs an area -- and \"influence\" -- in which one side has the upper hand.\n\nIn November 2015, the Afghan government controlled 72% of districts in the country, but now controls just 56% of them. Insurgent influence or control has risen to 12.5% of districts from just 7% and approximately a third of Afghanistan is a \"contested\" area.\n\nThe official figures offer a glimpse into the Afghan army's loosening grip in the face of a determined, sustained Taliban insurgency and a bleak outlook for America's involvement in the war -- now in its 17th year.\n\nRead More", "CNN's Anderson Cooper

CNN's Randi Kaye travels to Florida to talk to Trump supporters.", "(CNN) A doctor said she was racially profiled by two flight attendants as she aided a fellow passenger on a Delta Air Lines flight.\n\nDr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a physician and expert in obesity medicine, told CNN she was on a flight from Indianapolis to Boston on Tuesday when a woman sitting next to her started shaking and hyperventilating.\n\nStanford said she was already aiding the passenger when a flight attendant came by to check the situation. According to Stanford, the flight attendant asked if she was a doctor, to which Stanford replied yes.\n\nStanford said she continued to stabilize the passenger when a second flight attendant came to ask for her medical license. Stanford showed the flight attendant her license. Stanford said that shortly afterward both flight attendants came back and questioned her credentials and asked if the medical license she was carrying belonged to her.\n\nStanford described the exchange as \"bewildering.\"\n\n\"The validity of me as a physician is being called into question,\" Stanford said of the experience.\n\nStanford said she was able to continue looking after the sick passenger. She later decided to share what happened on social media.\n\n\"I am very disappointed that your policies on #Diversity have not lead to any change. As a #blackwoman #doctor who showed my #medical license to help a passenger on DL5935 your #flightattendant still did not believe I was a #Physician,\" Stanford tweeted at Delta.\n\nIn a second tweet, Stanford, who works at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, wrote that her accomplishments do not \"shield from racism.\"\n\nDelta responded to Stanford the next day via social media and later in an email and a phone call.\n\n\"I am so sorry for your frustration Dr. Stanford. Please know that Delta does not condone discrimination for any reason and we take your comments very seriously. We are looking into further and will be reaching out to you directly,\" Delta tweeted.\n\nStanford said an executive assistant called her and told her the company is looking at the incident and will follow up with her.\n\nJUST WATCHED Doctor: Female physicians don't work as hard Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Doctor: Female physicians don't work as hard 02:31\n\nDelta spokesman Anthony Black confirmed the airline reached out to Stanford as part of an investigation. Black said in a statement that, according to the flight crew's account, the flight attendants \"initially misread the credentials offered by the doctor and went to reconfirm her specific medical discipline.\"\n\n\"We are following up with the crew to ensure proper policy is followed. Dr. Stanford's care for the passenger remained uninterrupted throughout the duration of the medical issue,\" Black added.\n\nStanford said she felt \"very unsatisfied\" by Delta's response.\n\nSo I spoke with @Delta and I left the conversation quite uncertain that any changes will be made. Summary: flight attendants thought I was a #therapist despite #MDlicense. They will make sure this is addressed. Thanks for being a #skymiles member. Really?!$ #iamadoctor \u2014 Fatima Cody Stanford, MD, MPH, MPA, FAAP, FACP (@fstanfordmd) October 31, 2018\n\nStanford's disclosure prompted other doctors to share their own stories about navigating bias as women of color.\n\nHappen to me on same airline 3 years ago. The flight attendant kept calling for a physician until a male physician arrived. By that time they found someone else the passenger I helped was sitting up starting to feel better. \u2014 Reshma Gupta (@ReshmaGuptaMD) October 31, 2018\n\nThe debate is not new. In 2016, Dr. Tamika Cross, an OB-GYN who is black, wrote in a Facebook post that she was discriminated against on a Delta flight when attendants refused to let her help a man that was unresponsive. Cross' post went viral, along with the hashtag #whatadoctorlookslike\n\nAfter learning what happened to her colleague and friend, Cross took to Facebook again on Wednesday and posed the question \"Where have we come since 2016?\"\n\nDelta said in December 2016 that it reviewed and revised its process for accepting a medical professional's help during in-flight medical emergencies. In the announcement , the airline said Cross was part of the conversation that resulted in the company doing away with a policy that required flight attendants to verify medical credentials.\n\n\"They can now secure a medical professional's help based on the volunteer's statement that he or she is a physician, physician assistant, nurse, paramedic or EMT,\" the airline said then.\n\nStanford said she recently attended a conference organized by the Massachusetts Medical Society on the topic of gender and bias in medicine. Cross was the keynote speaker.\n\nStanford said her own experience and those of her peers have emphasized for her the importance of having \"more people that look like me\" in the medical field.\n\n\"I know that there's a lot of work to be done,\" Stanford said.", "\u0623\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633\u0629

search and rescue agency said it found the crashed Lion Air plane's landing gear, the wheels and a large part of the body of the aircraft during Thursday's search.\n\nThe discovery of the landing gear comes a day after investigators found the flight data recorder, commonly known as a \"black box,\" from Lion Air Flight JT610. The discovery should help explain why the new Boeing 737 crashed on Monday, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta, Muhammad Syauqi said the search agency used another strategy during its operations to try to locate plane parts. The strategy entailed anchoring a ship belonging to an oil company because the vessel was already well-versed in the location. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was also used.\n\nSyauqi said divers from the agency, the Navy, and the police were sent to sweep the area. They plan on using a ship crane on Friday to lift up the landing gear debris, Syauqi said.\n\nHe said that his team had not heard the ping from the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which records audio from the cockpit. It is thought to be on the seabed, some 35 meters (114 feet) from the surface.\n\nEarly Thursday, CNN Indonesia showed images of divers bringing the flight data recorder, commonly known as a \" black box ,\" on board one of the rescue ships in the sea close to Jakarta.\n\nMonday's ill-fated flight crashed 13 minutes after takeoff. The flight was supposed to be a one-hour flight to Pangkal Pinang on the island of Bangka.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Commission (KNKT) Deputy Director Haryo Satmiko told CNN that it will take two to three weeks to read the data from flight data recorder, and a further two to three months to analyze it.\n\nA photo from Indonesian media agency \"detikcom\" shows officials displaying part of the ill-fated Lion Air flight JT 610's flight data recorder, after it was recovered from the Java Sea on Thursday, November 1.\n\nCapt. Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi, managing director of Lion Group, which owns Lion Air as well as other airlines, declined to offer any possible explanations to CNN for the crash.\n\n\"As a company we are waiting for the result from the National Transportation Safety Committee working with the black box\" to determine what went wrong, Adi said.\n\nAdi said that he knew the pilots on the flight and they \"were very funny, very smart, very nice guys.\"\n\nHe said he believed the pilots did their job \"professionally and they struggled to save the aircraft,\" and offered his condolences to the families of the victims.\n\nJUST WATCHED No answers on cause of Lion Air plane crash Replay More Videos ...

After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked. It dropped about 400 feet,\" said Gaharu, adding that he had confirmed the height of the drop on a flight tracker website.\n\nHe said the drop felt like falling into \"a really, really deep hole.\"\n\nPhotos: In photos: Lion Air plane crashes off Indonesia A relative of one of the crash victims tosses flower petals from an Indonesian Navy ship on Tuesday, November 6.

That's sort of like trying to nail jello to the wall.\"\n\nIn the decades since that speech, Clinton's jello comment has become a something of a dark joke among internet freedom advocates, as China continued to build up the Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated system for controlling and surveilling the web\n\nA new report out this week shows that China is by far the most effective censor of the internet, and far from retreating, is exporting its model around the world.\n\nBeijing has consistently defied all the confident predictions (including by people far more knowledgeable about the internet than Clinton) that this would be impossible. China's censors have reigned in blogs, social media, and US search giants, and repeatedly defeated or stymied any attempts to undermine the Firewall , from virtual private networks (VPNs) to the dark web.\n\nSunday Yokubaitis, chief executive of VPN company Golden Frog, told CNN they have \"witnessed a massive increase\" in attempts to block their services in China.\n\n\"We used to see blocks roughly once every six weeks; they now try to block our service multiple times every day,\" he said.\n\nAs I document in my book, \" The Great Firewall of China: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet ,\" Beijing's model of the internet is now spreading beyond its borders, with China's censors working actively with their counterparts in Russia, Uganda and a host of other countries to build up internet controls and crack down on online dissent.\n\nA new report from Freedom House -- a US government-funded NGO -- supports this. During 2018, the authors found, \"internet freedom declined for the eighth consecutive year.\"\n\n\"A cohort of countries is moving toward digital authoritarianism by embracing the Chinese model of extensive censorship and automated surveillance systems,\" Freedom House said.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular press conference Thursday that the report's findings \"are sheer fabrications.\"\n\n\"They are unprofessional, irresponsible and made with ulterior motives,\" Lu added.\n\nForlorn hope\n\nDuring the early decades of the internet, many influential thinkers claimed the internet -- by its very nature -- would spread democracy and freedom of speech.\n\nThe combined forces of globalization and the web were, Thomas Friedman wrote in 2000, \"acting like nutcrackers to open societies.\"\n\nBut as writer Evgeny Morovoz has demonstrated, this assumption was often based on a willful misreading of the events of the Cold War, and the effectiveness of strategies like smuggling photocopiers and fax machines through the Iron Curtain and Radio Free Europe broadcasts.\n\n\"Viewing it through the prism of the Cold War, they endow the internet with nearly magical qualities; for them, it's the ultimate cheat sheet that could help the West finally defeat its authoritarian adversaries,\" Morozov writes. \"In other words, let them tweet, and they will tweet their way to freedom. By this logic, authoritarianism becomes unsustainable once the barriers to the free flow of information are removed. If the Soviet Union couldn't surprise a platoon of pamphleteers, how can China survive an army of bloggers?\"\n\nIn fact, as the Freedom House report demonstrates, the internet is an excellent tool for social control, enabling surveillance and guiding of public opinion that would have been impossible in the past.\n\nThis has been further boosted by the ongoing panic in the US and other countries which have typically been the biggest proponents of internet freedom over fake news and alleged election interference online.\n\n\"Throughout (2018), authoritarians used claims of 'fake news' and data scandals as a pretext to move closer to the China,\" the report said. \"Governments in countries such as Egypt and Iran rewrote restrictive media laws to apply to social media users, jailed critics under measures designed to curb false news, and blocked foreign social media and communication services.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Google alum criticizes company's China project Replay More Videos ...

In the past, the ITU has been a key body for China and other leading internet censors, particularly Russia, to push for changes to international regulations to legalize or enable their controls.\n\nIn 2015, China succeeded in expanding the ITU's powers and those of national governments to set internet policy, though Chinese delegates failed to remove the terms \"freedom of expression\" and \"democratic\" from a key internet governance document.\n\nWhile the meeting has only just got underway, most experts expect the issue of internet governance -- the key argument over which boils down to whether only governments should be able to set global policy, or if civil society and industry should have a role as well -- to dominate matters again in Dubai.\n\nChina's position is that national governments have the ultimate right to control the internet within their borders, and that this covers foreign companies, citizens, and anyone who attempts to interfere by, for example, creating software to undermine the Great Firewall.\n\nThe doctrine of cyber sovereignty, as advocated by Xi Jinping, will be on full display next month at China's own World Internet Conference in the southern Chinese river town of Wuzhen.\n\nThis year's forum \"will further enhance the establishment of an internet development outlook characterized by mutual trust and collective governance among countries worldwide,\" according to Liu Liehong, deputy director of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's top censor.\n\nJUST WATCHED Apple may have most to lose with China tariffs Replay More Videos ...

It's no wonder then, that the D\u00eda de los Muertos holiday was added to UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.\n\nWhat better place to celebrate than the destination of San Miguel de Allende -- itself a UNESCO World Heritage site? This picturesque town in north central Mexico, known for its pristine, colorful Colonial and Spanish architecture, is also a magnet for expats and artists.\n\nRelated content Tequila maker's tour of San Miguel de Allende\n\nSan Miguel's D\u00eda de los Muertos festivities are a four-day-long celebration of history and family, arts and culture, food and frolic referred to as La Calaca\n\nOn November 1, costumed revelers with calaveras, or skulls, painted on their faces, slowly snake through the cobblestone streets of San Miguel, ending at Parroquia de San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel, the 17th-century cathedral in the town's main square. This ancient tradition -- a mix of Aztec and Christian modalities -- has been celebrated throughout Central America and Mexico for thousands of years.\n\nDespite the timing, the Day of the Dead is not directly connected with Halloween. Their calendar adjacency, however, might relate to the growing popularity of D\u00eda de los Muertos events, particularly in the U.S.\n\nRelated content Chef Enrique Olvera redefines Mexican food\n\nThe 2017 Pixar film \"Coco,\" set in a fictional Mexican town during D\u00eda de los Muertos, won two Academy Awards and intensified obsession with the holiday.

Retailer Party City sells Day of the Dead costumes and decorations. Even Target has a collection of D\u00eda de los Muertos merchandise.\n\nRegardless of how or where or why the holiday is celebrated, visiting Mexico at this time of year is a true privilege.", "(CNN) In the most racially charged national political ad in 30 years, President Donald Trump and the Republican Party accuse Democrats of plotting to help people they depict as Central American invaders overrun the nation with cop killers.\n\nThe new web video, tweeted by the President five days before the midterm elections , is the most extreme step yet in the most inflammatory closing argument of any campaign in recent memory.\n\nThe Trump campaign ad is the latest example of the President's willingness to lie and fear-monger in order to tear at racial and societal divides; to embrace demagoguery to bolster his own political power and the cause of the Republican midterm campaign.\n\nThe web video -- produced for the Trump campaign -- features Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man who had previously been deported but returned to the United States and was convicted in February in the slaying of two California deputies.\n\n\"I'm going to kill more cops soon,\" a grinning Bracamontes is shown saying in court as captions flash across the screen reading \"Democrats let him into our country. Democrats let him stay.\"\n\nThe ad recalls the notorious \"Willie Horton\" campaign ad financed by supporters of the George H.W. Bush campaign in the 1988 presidential election. Horton was a convicted murderer who committed rape while furloughed under a program in Massachusetts where Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis was governor.\n\nThe ad has since come to be seen as one of the most racially problematic in modern political history since it played into white fear and African-American stereotypes. It was regarded at the time as devastating to the Dukakis campaign.\n\nTrump's web video, while just as shocking as the Horton spot, carries added weight since, unlike its 1988 predecessor, it bears the official endorsement of the leader of the Republican Party -- Trump -- and is not an outside effort. Given that Trump distributed it from his Twitter account, It also comes with all the symbolic significance of the presidency itself.\n\nIn a first reaction, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the ad was a sign of desperation and suggested that Trump was losing the argument over health care that is at the center of the Democratic campaign.\n\n\"This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,\" Perez said on CNN's \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\n\"This is fear mongering. ... They have to fear monger and his dog whistle of all dog whistles is immigration. This has been Donald Trump's playbook for so long.\"\n\n\"Family unification to invasion\"\n\nThe Trump ad also flashes to footage of the migrant caravan of Central American asylum seekers that is currently in Mexico, which Trump says is preparing an invasion of the United States, implying that everyone in the column of people fleeing repression, poverty and economic blight is bent on murder and serious crime on US soil.\n\n\"Who else would Democrats let in?\" a caption asks.\n\nA source close to the White House told CNN's Jim Acosta that the web ad was produced by Jamestown Associates for the Trump campaign for the midterms and was designed to fit into Trump's broader immigration push and to change the argument from \"family unification to invasion.\"\n\n\"It's clearly working. We are all talking about it and not health care,\" the source said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly warned that the caravan is laden with criminals or also includes Middle Eastern terrorists. He has offered no evidence for such claims, however, and even admitted last week there is no proof to support them.\n\nThe President has also often used racially suggestive rhetoric in his tweets and launched his presidential campaign in 2015 with a tirade against Mexicans. But he accuses the media, which points out his frequent falsehoods and flaming rhetoric, of being to blame for national divides.\n\nControversy over the new ad is certain to explode across the final days of the election in which polls suggest Democrats could take back the House of Representatives but Republicans could keep or even expand their Senate majority.\n\nThe new campaign web video was the culmination of a day on which the President staked out ever more extreme positions.\n\nHe took advantage of his role as commander-in-chief to promise to triple the number of troops to 15,000 that he has pledged to send to the southern border to repel the caravan -- which is still hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe also made a dubious claim of presidential power to reinforce his vow to change the Constitution on his own to end birthright citizenship that is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.\n\nA sign of weakness?\n\nTrump's combustible strategy is coinciding with an energetic final campaign swing featuring 11 rallies that opened in Florida on Wednesday night.\n\nHis increasingly inflammatory tactics are allowing him to refocus next Tuesday's election on his chosen issues, after a week of serial bombings and shootings that drowned out his closing argument.\n\nStill, Democrats are increasingly confident five days out that they will take back the House, which they lost in the 2010 midterms.\n\n\"Up until today, I would have said, 'if the election were held today, we would win,\" former and possibly future speaker Nancy Pelosi said on \"The Late Show\" on CBS Tuesday.\n\n\"What now I'm saying is, we will win.\"\n\nOne way of looking at Trump's increasingly frantic approach is that it is a sign of political weakness, because it seems to be a bid to drive up turnout in red state Senate races but might imply that tight House elections, that could be affected by such rhetoric, are out of reach.\n\nHowever, everyone wrote Trump off in 2016, and it's possible his combative approach could defy pollsters again.\n\nIn another extraordinary development on Wednesday, the sitting President lashed out at the House speaker of his own party five days before an election, in a possible preview of a post-voting blame game.\n\nPaul Ryan had dismissed the President's birthright gambit, but Trump told him in a tweet to do more to save the House.\n\n\"This is a great way to screw up the message a week before the election,\" a senior GOP aide told CNN's Acosta.\n\n\"First the birthright comment itself and now attacking the top Republican in Congress who is trying to save our majority.\"\n\nThe President insisted he would not blame Ryan if Democrats won the House, though sounded less confident about Republican prospects in that chamber than in the Senate.\n\n\"I know we're doing well in the Senate and it looks like we're doing OK in the House. We're going to have to see,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nCritics have accused Trump of abusing his power by sending troops to the southern border as part of a campaign stunt on a mission that has yet to be defined and he has implied will feature combat troops, but will in fact be made up of support forces.\n\nBut Defense Secretary James Mattis said Wednesday \"we don't do stunts\" and said the troops were being sent to offer \"practical support\" at the request of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHowever, Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California accused Trump of squandering taxpayer funds in a desperate bid to buy votes, and predicted the American people would see through the plan.\n\n\"We are sending 10 to 15,000 troops, which means we are going to spend between $100 (million) and $150 million so he can have, I guess his surprise, his October surprise,\" she said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\"\n\nTrump will Thursday press on with his pre-election blitz in Missouri, where he is trying to take out Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the first of two rallies in the state in the next few days. Before Tuesday he will also visit West Virginia, Indiana twice, Montana, Florida again, Georgia, Tennessee and Ohio.\n\nBut two senior GOP sources told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that the President had been asked to steer clear of Arizona and Nevada amid concern he could hurt rather than help Republicans locked in tight Senate races.", "\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0627

practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.\"\n\nDoha, Qatar (CNN) The murder of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul four weeks ago has severely damaged the reputation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been a favorite of the Trump administration.\n\nIt seems unlikely that President Trump will do anything especially substantive to punish the Saudis for the murder, since Trump has repeatedly pointed to the purported $110 billion of arms sales he has secured from Saudi Arabia as a rationale for maintaining close ties with the kingdom. (Here, Trump is making the mistake of believing his own propaganda, because, thus far, only a small fraction of those sales is actually happening.)\n\nTrump also needs the Saudis as allies for his anti-Iran policy, and because it is the largest exporter of oil in the world and therefore has the power to set oil prices.\n\nEven if the Trump administration doesn't do much to punish Saudi Arabia, that doesn't mean there isn't already global fallout for Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS.\n\nPotential investors in Saudi Arabia were already unsettled last year when MBS imprisoned some two hundred businessmen and princes on charges of supposed corruption. They were held at the Ritz Carlton in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, and freed only after more than $35 billion were extracted from them, according to MBS himself in an interview with Bloomberg News. This surely must be the most expensive hotel bill in history.\n\nThe murder of Khashoggi, and the Saudi government's multiple, implausible accounts about his fate, served to underscore MBS's previous rash moves. His botched invasion of Yemen in 2015 has helped to precipitate the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, according to the UN. Last year MBS also launched the blockade of neighboring gas-rich Qatar, and presided over the bizarre de facto abduction and short-lived \"resignation\" of the Lebanese prime minister when he was visiting the kingdom.\n\nBecause of Khashoggi's murder, MBS's grandiose \" Davos in the Desert \" conference in Saudi Arabia a week ago was a damp squib, with many leading businessmen and all Western media organizations pulling out of the event.\n\nThat is likely to have some real effects on MBS's ambitious \"Vision 2030\" plan to diversify the economy of Saudi Arabia. While defense contractors and oil companies will likely conduct business as usual with the kingdom, the other investors that MBS was hoping to attract to transform the heavily oil-dependent Saudi economy are much less likely to do business with it.\n\nBritish billionaire Richard Branson , for instance, has suspended his involvement in two tourism projects in Saudi Arabia, as well as discussions about a possible $1 billion Saudi investment in his space ventures.\n\nThe war in Yemen\n\nAfter Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan officially confirmed Khashoggi's murder last week, the Trump administration signaled that its long acquiescence in the conduct of the Saudi-led war in Yemen has finally evaporated. According to the UN, at least 16,000 civilians have died in the past three years in Yemen, mostly in airstrikes attributed to the Saudis.\n\nOn Tuesday, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis called for a ceasefire in Yemen, leading to peace talks within a month, as did US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIn Congress, members who are concerned by the Saudi conduct of the war in Yemen are calling to end American intelligence support to the Saudis, and to end US aerial refueling for Saudi aircraft involved in the conflict. If the Democrats take the House in the midterm election on November 6, those calls are only likely to amplify.\n\nThe skepticism about the Saudis is now bipartisan; on Wednesday a group of Republican senators asked Trump to suspend negotiations over a US-Saudi civil nuclear agreement because of concerns about the conduct of the war in Yemen and the murder of Khashoggi.\n\nThe blockade of Qatar\n\nThe small state of Qatar sits on some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world. It is also home to the largest US military base in the Middle East , which coordinates the wars against ISIS and the Taliban and is also the launchpad for airstrikes against these groups.\n\nAccording to a former US official with knowledge of the basing arrangement in Qatar, the Qataris pay 90% of the costs for the base, the kind of deal that Trump should have found to his liking -- an American base almost entirely paid for by another country\n\nQatar also houses regional hubs of several leading American universities, such as Georgetown and Cornell.\n\nSo it was surprising that President Trump endorsed the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar when it began last June. This came shortly after Trump had made his first overseas trip as President to Saudi Arabia, where he was treated to a fawning welcome.\n\nAs the blockade got underway, Trump immediately aligned himself with Saudi talking points about Qatar, tweeting , \"So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding......extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!\"\n\nJoshua Geltzer, the former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council for both President Obama and President Trump, says that, in fact, \"The Qataris were generally important counterterrorism partners. The biggest sticking point was the terrorism financing issue. My sense is that they've realized over time the concerns about that and are working to tighten up their approach to that critical aspect of dealing with the terrorism challenge.\" (Geltzer is a fellow at New America, where I also work.)\n\nBelatedly, Trump realized that the blockade of Qatar made little sense from an American national security perspective and tried to put pressure on the Saudis to lift it, so far to no avail.\n\nFor more opinion...

Qatar has the second highest per capita income in the world and, by Gulf standards, it has a relaxed approach to social mores. It is also home to the Al Jazeera television network, which is one of the few independent sources of news in the Arab world.\n\nAnd it continues to house the most important US military base in the Middle East.\n\nQatar is also hosting an office for the Taliban. After 17 years of war with no end in sight in Afghanistan, the Trump administration has proven willing -- perhaps surprisingly -- to enter into direct negations with the Taliban, which are taking place in Qatar.\n\nThe Qataris seemed to have weathered the blockade well. At one point they feared it was a prelude to a military invasion by their much larger neighbor, Saudi Arabia. That hasn't happened.\n\nNow it is the Saudis who have to worry about how the rest of the world sees them and deals with them, despite their key importance to global oil markets. It's just one of the unexpected consequences of their murder of a journalist in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

We've seen the rise of millennial pink as a 'It' hue, but also its appropriation by feminists around the world as a powerful, socio-political mark.\n\n\"The 150-year-old notion of pink as synonym with fragile femininity brought forward by the West is being challenged. Pink is now having a 'cool' phase: It's hip, it's androgynous, it's strong. And it's here to stay.\"\n\nA colorful history\n\nIn the West, pink first became fashionable in the mid-1700s, when European aristocrats -- both men and women -- wore faint, powdery variants as a symbol of luxury and class. Madame de Pompadour, the chief mistress of Louis XV, loved the color so much that, in 1757, French porcelain manufacturer S\u00e8vres named its exquisite new shade of pink, Rose Pompadour, after her.\n\nPink was not then considered a \"girls\" color -- infants of both sexes were dressed in white. The tint was, in fact, often considered more appropriate for little boys because it was seen as a paler shade or red, which had \"masculine,\" military undertones.\n\nA 1779 image of a man dressed in pink, by Pierre-Thomas LeClerc. Credit: Valerie Steele\n\nThe more recent association with women and femininity started around the mid-19th century when, according to Steele, \"men in the Western world increasingly wore dark, sober colors,\" leaving brighter and pastel options to their female counterparts.\n\n\"The feminization of pink really began around there,\" she explained. \"Pink became an expression of delicacy, as well as froth.\"\n\nPink also, as Steele's book notes, developed its first erotic connotations around this time, because it hinted at nakedness. Lingerie in shades of pink became increasingly common, as did references to the color's sexual allure in literature and art -- always in relation to the female body.\n\nBy the turn of century, pink had entered the mainstream -- and its status shifted in the process. The advent of industrialization and mass-production led to the growing cheap dyes like magenta, which resulted in bright, garish versions of the color. Pink went from luxury to working-class and, as a color often worn by prostitutes at the time, from sophisticated to vulgar.\n\nA pink corset dating back to 1880s America.

In the first two decades of the 20th century, French couturier Paul Poiret created dresses in pale and pastel pinks, as well as bolder cherry, coral and fuchsia, propelling the shade back into the realm of high fashion. By the 1950s, pink had become more gender-coded than ever, thanks to branding and marketing in postwar America that used it as a symbol of hyper-femininity, cementing a pervasive \"pink for girls, blue for boys\" stereotype.\n\n\"Society decides what colors mean,\" said Steele, who is also the director of the Museum at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, where an exhibition on the color pink is currently on show. \"When that particular divide was made, it reinforced the perception of pink as a frivolous, because of its association with women, who have been traditionally looked down upon.\"\n\nWhy the color red turns us on\n\nShifting significance\n\nPink regained some its allure around the 1960s, when public figures such as Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe adopted it as mark of luxury. Punk bands like The Ramones and The Clash made it edgier in the 1980s, while in more recent decades, pop, celebrity and hip-hop cultures have embraced the color in different ways -- from Madonna performing in a Jean Paul Gaultier soft pink cone-cupped bustier in 1990, to rapper Cam'ron attending New York Fashion Week in a pink mink coat and matching hat in 2002, helping to show that pink could again be considered a men's color.\n\nNonetheless, Europeans and Americans repeatedly describe it as one of their least favorite colors in polls.\n\n\"All colors have complications.\" Steele said. \"But I do think that pink is one of the most controversial ones -- and one of the most divisive, too. It arouses very strong emotions, whether good or bad.\"\n\nFenty Puma by Rihanna, Spring/Summer 2017. Credit: Tim Walker/Puma\n\nPink continues to be be received in wildly different ways around the world. Steele believes that Asian cultures are often more partial to pink than Western ones, with her book pointing to Japan in particular, where cosplay and the notion of a \"youth-oriented, feminized cuteness\" have made pink the color of choice for a whole sub-culture of urban \"Lolitas\" sporting doll-like styles.\n\nIn India, pink has long been understood as a hue for both sexes, with men commonly wearing pink clothing, adornments and turbans -- particularly in the north Indian state of Rajasthan.\n\nPink has also been embraced as a color of protest and awareness for various other communities. Pink triangles, once used in concentration camps by the Nazis to identify homosexuals, became a symbol of gay activism in the 1970s. The shade has been increasingly associated with the LGBTQ community, with Steele's book noting how, in France, AIDS was sometimes referred to as \"the pink plague.\"\n\nA model walks the runway at Steve Boi Presents \"Pink\" show during New York Fashion Week. Credit: Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\nElsewhere, it has become internationally synonymous with the fight against breast cancer, in the form of a pink ribbon. In the US, meanwhile, female protesters have been wearing pink to signify ownership of their sexual, reproductive and social rights.\n\n\"Pink is going through a generational shift,\" Steele said. \"Society is increasingly moving away from the idea of it as a childish, over-sexualized hue. There's a shared recognition that pink can be pretty and powerful, feminine and feminist. Men are turning to it, too -- as (they did) in the 18th century. We're re-framing pink.\"", "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) Harrowing accounts of widespread sexual abuse allegedly carried out by North Korean officials against ordinary women have been laid out in a new report, that details evidence of a culture where officials commit acts with near total impunity.\n\nThe extensive 98-page report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), which was released Thursday and took more than two years to compile, is based on dozens of interviews with sexual abuse victims who have fled from North Korea . It reveals an oppressive world where officials -- from police officers and prison guards to market supervisors -- faced virtually no consequences for their routine abuse of women.\n\n\"Unwanted sexual contact and violence that is so common in North Korea it has come to be accepted as part of ordinary life,\" the report alleges.\n\nSexual violence in the country is \"an open, unaddressed, and widely tolerated secret,\" said Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch's executive director. \"North Korean woman would probably say 'Me Too' if they thought there was any way to obtain justice, but their voices are silenced in Kim Jong Un's dictatorship.\"\n\nWomen in the sitting position in a pre-trial detention facility run by the police. The report alleges that detainees are commonly forced to assume this position in pre-trial detention and temporary holding facilities.\n\nHarrowing accounts\n\nOf all the sexual assault survivors interviewed for the report, only one said she had tried to report it. None of the others report the assault they suffered because \"they did not trust the police and did not believe police would be willing to take action,\" the report says.\n\n\"On the days they felt like it, market guards or police officials could ask me to follow them to an empty room outside the market, or some other place they'd pick,\" the report quoted a former trader in her 40s who fled North Korea in 2014 (HRW uses an alias). She says she had been sexually assaulted many times.\n\n\"They consider us (sex) toys. We are at the mercy of men.\" She said that the climate of sexual abuse was so pervasive that it had been normalized -- both by the perpetrators and their victims, but nonetheless, \"sometimes, out of nowhere, you cry at night and don't know why.\"\n\nMedical professionals who fled the repressive country said that \"there are no protocols for medical treatment and examination of victims of sexual violence to provide therapeutic care or secure medical evidence,\" the report adds.\n\nThe rights organization interviewed a total of 106 North Koreans, comprised of 72 women, four girls, and 30 men. All were interviewed outside the country.\n\nMale government officials and female traders sit in a railway carriage, while a railroad officer checks a female trader's ticket. The report alleges that in railway carriages, women often face harassment by male government officials and railroad officers.\n\nFormer police officer: Nine out of ten women assaulted\n\nA former police officer from North Korea, herself a victim of sexual abuse, Heo Jong-hae told CNN that 90% of the women she knew had been sexually assaulted.\n\nShe said that one of her friends contemplated suicide after being attacked at age 17.\n\n\"She said she cried and wanted to die. Her parents told her to come home before dark to avoid rape but things like this happens in broad daylight. She tried to kill herself. It was worse in Pyongyang where everyone was forced to go to work every day.\"\n\nHeo said that in order to advance, many women join the military, but \"the officials in charge will demand sexual favors. To join the (worker's) party, one must comply.\"\n\nShe added that, in her experience, in the rare event of a case being reported to the police, there is pressure to drop the investigation. \"When the perpetrator is an official, even if the case comes to the police, it will be ignored,\" she said.\n\n\"Even if I or others in the station try to investigate, someone higher up like the chief will tell us to drop it. They are untouchable.\"\n\nHeo said that her personal experience of assault largely informed her decision to defect.\n\n\"I couldn't live in that environment with stress. When I share my story, (I hope) other women share theirs too.\"\n\nA female trader gives a bribe to a market supervisor in an alley near the market. The report describes how female traders offer bribes in order to avoid potential harassment.\n\n'No sense of right and wrong'\n\nEven when men who sexually abuse women are held to account, their victims also suffer.\n\nDirector of New Korea Women's Union Lee So-yeon, a North Korean living in Seoul, told CNN that while she was serving in the North Korean military, a commander of her company sexually assaulted female soldiers. He faced a forced discharge, while his vice commander was assigned to a different unit. The commander's female victims were dishonorably discharged.\n\n\"The perpetrators are usually not punished if the victims number one or two. There is also less chance of being punished the higher the ranking of the perpetrator. In this case, he assaulted about 30 women.\n\n\"The victims were dishonorably discharged because it was considered that they simply had sexual relations with the commander while on duty. That they had actively taken part.\"\n\nEven after the incident is over, the women continue to suffer its consequences.\n\n\"Once the word gets out that a woman had been victimized, the society doesn't look kindly at her. Instead, she is blamed for her reckless and seductive behavior,\" Lee said.\n\n\"There is no sense of right and wrong. The party officials must see these as a problem in order for the situation to change but they do not. They are the perpetrators themselves.\"\n\nA police officer checks to see if a trader has hidden \"anti-socialist\" material in her belongings. The report alleges that police officers use searches of female traders' belongings, to justify full body searches.\n\nNonexistent conviction rates\n\nWhile Pyongyang has laws criminalizing rape, trafficking and having sexual relations with subordinates, the report notes that the North Korean government barely acknowledges the existence of rape in the country.\n\nLast July, the North Korean government told the UN's Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) that only nine people in all of North Korea were convicted of rape in 2008, seven in 2011, and five in 2015.\n\nIt added that sexual and gender-based violence was common throughout North Korean society, including in dealing with officials. Some of the incidences of sexual violence, including forced abortions, and rape committed against detained and imprisoned women, qualified as crimes against humanity.", "Lo que le ocurri\u00f3 a Colmenares, entonces de 20 a\u00f1os, desde que sali\u00f3 de una discoteca en la madrugada hasta que finalmente hallaron su cad\u00e1ver horas despu\u00e9s, permanece bajo un manto de duda\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) \u2013 Primero una fiesta de Halloween. Despu\u00e9s la tragedia. Aunque parezca la trama de alguna pel\u00edcula de terror, as\u00ed empez\u00f3 el caso que ha mantenido en vilo a Colombia durante los \u00faltimos 8 a\u00f1os: la muerte del estudiante Luis Andr\u00e9s Colmenares, cuyo cuerpo apareci\u00f3 en un ca\u00f1o al norte de Bogot\u00e1 el 31 de octubre de 2010.\n\nLo que le ocurri\u00f3 a Colmenares, entonces de 20 a\u00f1os, desde que sali\u00f3 de una discoteca en la madrugada hasta que finalmente hallaron su cad\u00e1ver horas despu\u00e9s, permanece bajo un manto de duda pese a que ya hay dos sentencias judiciales\u2026 Sin ning\u00fan condenado. El caso, inicialmente tratado como un suicidio, cobr\u00f3 relevancia tras la exhumaci\u00f3n del cuerpo un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s, cuando la familia insisti\u00f3 en que su muerte se deb\u00eda a un asesinato y la Fiscal\u00eda empez\u00f3 a investigarlo como tal.\n\nA partir de entonces, su nombre no ha dejado de protagonizar titulares. Tanto as\u00ed que a principios de este mes, Netflix anunci\u00f3 que trabaja en una producci\u00f3n sobre el caso que se estrenar\u00eda en 2019. Ahora que se cumplen ocho a\u00f1os desde que Colmenares muri\u00f3, recordamos su caso y otras muertes famosas en Latinoam\u00e9rica que siguen sin resolverse.\n\nColombia: el caso Colmenares\n\nLuis Andr\u00e9s Colmenares, estudiante de la Universidad de Los Andes, sali\u00f3 de su casa en Bogot\u00e1 la noche del 30 de octubre de 2010. Iba disfrazado de diablo para lo que ser\u00eda una fiesta de Halloween con sus amigos de estudio en una discoteca ubicada al norte de Bogot\u00e1. Lo recogi\u00f3 Laura Moreno, una de sus compa\u00f1eras y la otra protagonista de este caso. Para ese momento, Colmenares y Moreno eran m\u00e1s que amigos aunque sin un noviazgo formal o, en palabras de la juez de uno de los procesos, ten\u00edan una relaci\u00f3n superficial y \u201capenas se estaban conociendo\u201d.\n\nTerminada la fiesta aproximadamente a las 3 de la ma\u00f1ana del 31 de octubre, Colmenares y Moreno salen de la discoteca Penthouse, junto a la amiga de \u00e9l Jessy Quintero, porque Luis Andr\u00e9s quer\u00eda comerse un perro caliente que en Bogot\u00e1 suelen venderse en la calle: estaba borracho. Una vez lo compraron, relat\u00f3 Laura, \u00e9l sale a correr, mientras ella intenta detenerlo dos veces sin \u00e9xito y terminan en el ca\u00f1o El Virrey, al norte de la ciudad, lugar al que \u00e9l se lanza y ella deja de verlo. Mientras todo esto ocurre, Moreno le narra los hechos a Jessy Quintero por tel\u00e9fono y despu\u00e9s sale a dar aviso a la polic\u00eda de que Colmenares acababa de lanzarse al ca\u00f1o. Entonces empieza una b\u00fasqueda infructuosa, con bomberos incluidos, por encontrarlo. Sin embargo, el cuerpo lo hallan hasta entrada la noche, aproximadamente 16 horas despu\u00e9s de que se reportara la supuesta ca\u00edda.\n\nA Colmenares lo enterraron en Villanueva, La Guajira, al norte de Colombia, d\u00f3nde \u00e9l hab\u00eda nacido. Sin embargo, el caso se reabre un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s y la Fiscal\u00eda empieza a indagar la tesis del homicidio. El cuerpo se exhum\u00f3 y en una nueva necropsia \u2013que ha sido puesta en duda por las autoridades judiciales\u2013 aparecen golpes, lesiones y fracturas que no corresponden al de una ca\u00edda de altura. Adem\u00e1s, siempre qued\u00f3 la duda de que Colmenares, aunque estaba borracho, se hubiera ahogado con el cauce poco abundante que hab\u00eda en el ca\u00f1o. Llegan entonces a\u00f1os de audiencias, interrogatorios, sospechosos, testigos falsos y cambio de fiscales.\n\nLaura Moreno \u2013quien siempre se mantuvo en su versi\u00f3n de la ca\u00edda y neg\u00f3 cualquier supuesto asesinato de Colmenares\u2013 fue acusada por la Fiscal\u00eda de ser coautora del homicidio. La tesis de la entidad fue que el cuerpo de Luis Andr\u00e9s no se encontr\u00f3 en la b\u00fasqueda inicial porque no estaba en el ca\u00f1o: fue atacado y golpeado en otro lugar por terceros y con ayuda de Moreno, quienes despu\u00e9s lo dejaron en este lugar. A Jessy Quintero la acusaron de encubrimiento y falso testimonio porque respaldaba la versi\u00f3n de Laura. Sin embargo, en 2017, las dos fueron absueltas de los cargos por una juez de Bogot\u00e1, quien argument\u00f3 que la Fiscal\u00eda no solo no pudo probar la responsabilidad de Quintero y Moreno sino que tampoco comprob\u00f3 la tesis del asesinato. Seg\u00fan el fallo, Colmenares muri\u00f3 producto de la ca\u00edda. Una decisi\u00f3n que fue apelada por la Fiscal\u00eda y cuyo futuro est\u00e1 en manos del Tribunal Superior de Bogot\u00e1.\n\nAhora, del mismo caso se desprendi\u00f3 un proceso contra Carlos C\u00e1rdenas, exnovio de Laura Moreno, quien fue acusado por la Fiscal\u00eda de ser coautor del asesinato de Colmenares. La Fiscal\u00eda insisti\u00f3 en su tesis de que el cuerpo recibi\u00f3 varios golpes con diferentes fuerzas y en momentos diferentes, que no correspond\u00edan con una ca\u00edda. Algo en lo que C\u00e1rdenas tendr\u00eda responsabilidad, a pesar de que siempre neg\u00f3 los se\u00f1alamientos. Finalmente, el juez de primera instancia decidi\u00f3 absolverlo por no encontrar pruebas concluyentes que lo vincularan al caso. Decisi\u00f3n fue ratificada por el Tribunal Superior de Bogot\u00e1 en 2014, que determin\u00f3 que C\u00e1rdenas no puede ser considerado responsable. Sin embargo, los magistrados s\u00ed se\u00f1alaron que la causa de muerte de Colmenares fue producto de un homicidio y no un accidente, lo que contradice la tesis de la juez en el proceso de Quintero y Moreno.\n\nM\u00e9xico: desaparici\u00f3n y muerte de Paulette Gebara\n\nPaulette Gebara ten\u00eda cuatro a\u00f1os cuando desapareci\u00f3 de su casa en M\u00e9xico el 22 de marzo de 2010. No pod\u00eda hablar y necesitaba ayuda para caminar. Sus padres explicaron que la acostaron el domingo por la noche y al d\u00eda siguiente ya no estaba. Los esfuerzos por encontrarla acapararon mucha atenci\u00f3n en el pa\u00eds y se designaron 30 investigadores para su caso. En internet, p\u00e1ginas web de amigos de la familia y otros ped\u00edan ayuda para dar con su paradero.\n\nPero, el caso tuvo un giro abrupto 9 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s: el cuerpo de Paulette fue hallado entre el marco de su cama y el colch\u00f3n, en su habitaci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan inform\u00f3 en su momento el fiscal general del Estado de M\u00e9xico, Alberto Bazbaz. Los restos estaban cubiertos por s\u00e1banas y una cobija: lo que llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n de los investigadores fue el olor a descomposici\u00f3n. En un principio, Bazbaz apunt\u00f3 que la principal sospechosa era la madre, Lisette Farah. \u201cNo tengo dudas de que se trata de una investigaci\u00f3n por homicidio. En este momento, podemos decir que Lisette es una sospechosa\u201d, sostuvo Bazbaz. Los padres de la ni\u00f1a y dos ni\u00f1eras fueron detenidos, pero no acusados. En ese entonces, se determin\u00f3 que la causa de la muerte de Paulette fue \u201casfixia que obstruy\u00f3 sus v\u00edas respiratorias y comprimi\u00f3 su t\u00f3rax\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3 el fiscal.\n\nLas dudas sobre c\u00f3mo permaneci\u00f3 el cuerpo tanto tiempo en ese lugar sin ser detectado empezaron a aumentar. Sin embargo, tras un par de semanas, a finales de mayo, el mismo Bazbaz se\u00f1al\u00f3 que tras la investigaci\u00f3n se concluy\u00f3 que la muerte y asfixia de Paulette fue accidental, por lo que no procede ninguna acci\u00f3n penal contra nadie y aclar\u00f3 que el proceso inicial fue apresurado. Palabras m\u00e1s, palabras menos: que la ni\u00f1a se asfixi\u00f3 accidentalmente. Ante los cuestionamientos que gener\u00f3 esta afirmaci\u00f3n, Bazbaz decidi\u00f3 renunciar a su cargo de fiscal general ese mismo mes.\n\nArgentina: Alberto Nisman, de suicidio a asesinato\n\nLas circunstancias que rodearon la muerte del fiscal Alberto Nisman el 18 de enero de 2015 provocaron dudas desde el principio. Nisman apareci\u00f3 sin vida con un tiro en la cabeza en el ba\u00f1o de su departamento de Buenos Aires. Apenas cuatro d\u00edas antes hab\u00eda denunciado a la entonces presidenta Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner y a varios funcionarios del gobierno por el supuesto encubrimiento de los acusados iran\u00edes por el atentado a la mutual jud\u00eda AMIA en 1994, que dej\u00f3 85 muertos.\n\nAunque al principio se habl\u00f3 de un suicidio, el pasado 1 de junio, la justicia de segunda instancia a trav\u00e9s de la C\u00e1mara Federal ratific\u00f3 que el fiscal fue asesinado en \u201cdirecta consecuencia de la denuncia por encubrimiento contra la expresidenta Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u201d. Ahora, este fallo no es un se\u00f1alamiento directo contra la exmandataria, quien ha dicho que los se\u00f1alamientos de su relaci\u00f3n con el crimen del fiscal son \u201cun disparate\u201d y no tienen fundamentos.\n\nEl juez Juli\u00e1n Ercolini se\u00f1al\u00f3 que la muerte de Nisman \u201chabr\u00eda sido producida por terceras personas y en forma dolosa\u201d. De acuerdo al recuento de los hechos que hace el juez, Nisman fue asesinado con el arma de Diego Lagormarsino, quien fue la \u00faltima persona en estar en el departamento del fiscal. \"Lagomarsino un eslab\u00f3n m\u00e1s de la compleja cadena de personas que de una u otra forma condujeron el destino de Nisman al conocido final\u201d. Lagomarsino, quien admiti\u00f3 haber prestado el arma al fiscal, ha negado haber participado en el homicidio.\n\nPer\u00fa: el asesinato de Myriam Fefer\n\nLa principal acusada del homicidio de Myriam Fefer, una empresaria peruana que fue asesinada en su casa de Lima el 15 de agosto de 2006, fue su propia hija: Eva Bracamonte Fefer. Durante a\u00f1os, las autoridades se\u00f1alaron a la joven de parricidio por lucro, a pesar de que ella se mantuvo en que era inocente. Y tambi\u00e9n identificaron como autor material confeso al colombiano Alejandro Trujillo Ospina, quien fue sentenciado a 35 a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel en octubre de 2012.\n\nEl caso requiri\u00f3 dos juicios orales. En el primero, Bracamonte fue condenada a 30 a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel en 2012 y declarada culpable del crimen de parricidio, pues se estableci\u00f3 que Trujillo no entr\u00f3 a la vivienda de Fefer a robar sino a asesinarla. Adem\u00e1s, lo habr\u00edan ayudado a ingresar a la casa. Sin embargo, casi un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s, en septiembre de 2013, un magistrado anul\u00f3 el juicio y orden\u00f3 la libertad de Bracamonte bajo el argumento de que se le vulner\u00f3 el debido proceso.\n\nEn el segundo procedimiento, Bracamonte fue se\u00f1alada de homicidio por lucro. Seg\u00fan el Ministerio P\u00fablico Bracamonte pretend\u00eda acceder de inmediato el legado que le dejaba el padre de Fefer, pero eso no era posible si su madre continuaba viva. De ah\u00ed que para la Fiscal\u00eda ella haya contratado los servicios il\u00edcitos de Trujillo Ospina para el crimen. Sin embargo en diciembre de 2015, la Sala Penal para Reos de la Corte Superior absolvi\u00f3 a Bracamonte del parricidio \u2013primer juicio\u2013 por considerar que no se prob\u00f3 su responsabilidad.

Bush in the 1990s and blamed the difficulty, in part, on the \"excessive nature of the so-called ethics checks.\"\n\n\"If you were designing a system to discourage people from coming into government, you would do it this way,\" Bolton said.\n\n\"That risks building up a priestly class\" of government employees, he added.\n\n\"It's really depressing to see,\" Bolton said of the bureaucratic red tape.\n\nApplication process 'onerous'\n\nThe nomination process is widely considered to be a challenge. One Trump administration nominee who had served in a previous Republican administration told CNN that disclosure forms now require so much detail that they take far longer to complete. This person said it took weeks to finish an application process that they described as onerous.\n\nBut Norm Eisen, the chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and former White House special counsel for ethics and government reform in the Obama administration who is now a CNN commentator, dismissed Bolton's complaints as \"totally false.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Eisen told CNN, \"because I was in charge of vetting people for these jobs in the Obama administration and there are always more qualified people for these jobs than there are jobs.\"\n\nEthics standards for government nominees have been in place since the 1970s and the Ethics in Government Act, said Eisen.\n\n\"What we have really, truly seen, to an extraordinary extent, is that Trump himself and his Cabinet have stumbled over these rules,\" Eisen said, pointing to high-profile departures of Trump Cabinet officials, including former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, and the investigations into Zinke along with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, who both faced Hatch Act violations.\n\nEthics issues have dogged the administration, and Zinke is only the latest in a long list of Trump administration officials facing scrutiny about their use of government resources.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been cited by the Office of Government Ethics for failing to divest himself of investments as he was required to do and for acquiring new ones. Ross and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, two of the richest members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, have been criticized for their lack of transparency about their ongoing investments.\n\nFormer Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Price resigned over ethical lapses and violation of government rules. Shulkin used taxpayer dollars to pay for his wife to accompany him to Europe on a business trip and improperly accepted tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London.\n\nHaley, Conway and White House social media director Dan Scavino have all been cited for violations of the loosely enforced Hatch Act, a law that prohibits federal employees from engaging in government-funded political activity.\n\nAnd then there's Trump. His decision not to divest from his family business or release his tax returns has raised questions about the fact that his extensive use of his own properties funnels millions in taxpayer dollars to the Trump family business.\n\nThere are also concerns that it gives foreign governments that book large blocks of rooms in Trump hotels an easy way to curry favor. Trump faces several lawsuits over potential violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which forbids members of the government from accepting payments from foreign governments.\n\nOn Wednesday, as Bolton argued that the ethics rules would keep government appointees to a select few, he said the \"virtue of American society has been fluidity, flexibility ... to the extent you wall government off from the rest of society,\" the ethics rules do that.", "(CNN) Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called President Donald Trump's new immigration ad an example of the President \"at his worst.\"\n\nWhen asked Wednesday by CNN's Chris Cuomo for his reaction, Perez called the ad an example of Trump \"fear mongering.\"\n\n\"This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,\" Perez told Cuomo on \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\nThe ad, tweeted by Trump on Wednesday afternoon , shows a Hispanic man bragging about killing police officers during a courtroom appearance and says Democrats want to allow more people like him into the country.\n\n\"This is fear mongering. They're hemorrhaging, Chris, on the health care issue. Health care is the number one issue in this country. ... They can't talk about those (issues) because they're on the wrong side.\"\n\n\"His dog whistle of all dog whistles is immigration. This has been Donald Trump's playbook for so long,\" Perez said, later adding that illegal southern border crossings have been at \"their lowest levels since the 1970s.\"\n\nThe DNC chairman argued that the key to solving the immigration crisis is to work with the leaders of the migrants' home countries, but that Trump's hateful rhetoric against Latinos thwarted any constructive policymaking.\n\n\"The way you solve this problem is by building relationships with countries in the region. But when you demonize Latinos every day, you make it harder to solve these problems,\" Perez said. \"That's why you see failures in immigration policy under this administration, because nobody wants to work with our country because you're constantly calling Mexicans 'thugs' and all these other atrocious names. That's why they can't do it.\"\n\nCNN panelists Ana Navarro and Scott Jennings weighed in later on \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\nNavarro called the new ad a continuation of a \"tired, old playbook\" dating back to 2016.\n\n\"It's just more of Donald Trump being Donald Trump,\" Navarro said. \"To me it's such a tired, old playbook. This is what he did in 2016: fear mongering, division, sowing discord, demonizing immigrants. And it worked. That is why he is going back to it, because it worked.\"\n\nWhen Cuomo asked Jennings why he liked the ad, Jennings replied, \"I'm not surprised by the ad.\"\n\n\"These messages are basically what Donald Trump has been talking about since he first started running for president,\" he said, echoing Navarro's remarks. \"I think the point he's trying to make is that the Republican Party is the party of border security and the Democratic Party, at least among some candidates and in some quarters, is the party of abolish (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and open borders.\"\n\n\"It's not the message I would be closing a campaign on,\" Jennings later added, though he noted that \"immigration does have high intensity scores in the polling for a lot of Republican voters.\"", "New York (CNN Business) Jon Stewart has been done with \"The Daily Show\" for years, but he's still one of the strongest media critics around.\n\nIn a new interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Stewart chided journalists for taking President Trump's \"bait\" and taking his anti-media attacks too personally.\n\nFirst, Stewart shared a familiar critique: That Trump is \"giving you all cash,\" that he's helping the bottom lines of media companies due to the unending news and debate about all things Trump.\n\nWhile that might be an issue for news executives, Amanpour said, journalists \"believe that our job is to navigate the truth and to do the fact-checking and all the rest of it.\"\n\n\"But I think the journalists have taken it personally,\" Stewart said. \"They're personally wounded and offended by this man. He baits them and they dive in, and what he's done well, I thought, is appeal to their own narcissism, to their own ego.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) It may not be as oft-quoted as the First Amendment or as contested as the Second Amendment, but the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution plays a critical role in supporting some of our closest-held notions of American freedom and equality.\n\nFor one, it clearly states that American citizenship is a birthright for all people who are born on American soil -- something that President Donald Trump has announced he wants to end . Not only would this unravel 150 years of American law, it would loosen a significant cornerstone of the Constitution's interpretation of American identity.\n\nIn order to better understand this part of the 14th Amendment, we asked two experts in constitutional and immigration law to walk us through the first section. The amendment has five sections, but we will only be dealing with the first, which contains the Citizenship Clause and three other related clauses.\n\nBut first, some history\n\nThe 14th Amendment is known as a Reconstruction amendment, because it was added to the Constitution after the Civil War in 1868. That places it at an important historical crossroads, when lingering wounds of divisiveness and animosity still plagued the nation and the reality of a post-slavery America begged contentious racial and social questions.\n\n\"Thomas Jefferson said men were created equal, but the original Constitution betrayed that promise by allowing for slavery,\" says Jeffrey Rosen. \"The 13th, 14th and 15th amendments were designed to enshrine Lincoln's promise of a new America.\"\n\nHowever, as so often is the case, this reaffirmed American ideal fell short of reality. Rosen notes that issues of civil rights and equal treatment continued to be denied to African Americans, LGBT people and other citizens for more than a century after the amendment's ratification.\n\nAnd Erika Lee points out that Native Americans weren't even allowed to become citizens until 1925.\n\n\"Even as [these amendments] were written, obviously there were major built-in inequalities and maybe at the time weren't intended to apply to everyone,\" Lee says.\n\nWhy was citizenship by birthright such an important concept?\n\n\"Citizenship was a central question left open by the original Constitution,\" says Rosen. \"At the time it was written, the Constitution assumed citizenship, but it didn't provide any rules for it. In the infamous Dred Scott decision, the Chief Justice said African Americans can't be citizens of the US and 'had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.'\"\n\nThe US Supreme Court's ruling in the Dred Scott case, named for a slave who unsuccessfully sued for his freedom, has since been widely condemned.\n\n\"The 14th Amendment was designed to overturn this decision and define citizenship once and for all, and it was based on birthright,\" Rosen says. \"It is really important that it's a vision of citizenship based on land rather than blood. It is an idea that anyone can be an American if they commit themselves to our Constitutional values.\"\n\nWhat does it mean to be \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof?\"\n\nAccording to Rosen, this is one of the greatest questions of citizenship. There are two clear examples of people not subject to the jurisdictions of the United States: diplomats and their children, and -- at the time of the 14th Amendment -- Native Americans, who were not recognized as part of the American populace.\n\n\"With those two exceptions, everyone who was physically present in the United States was thought to be under its jurisdiction,\" Rosen says. \"There are numerous Supreme Court cases that reaffirm that understanding, and almost as importantly, there are lots of congressional statutes that assume birthright citizenship.\"\n\nSome scholars, like John Eastman of the Claremont Institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence , have argued that children of undocumented immigrants are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the US and thus should not be considered citizens under the Constitution.\n\nBut Rosen says this is a minority view among constitutional scholars of all political backgrounds.\n\n\"While the Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled [on the issue of children of undocumented immigrants], Congress has passed all kinds of laws presuming their citizenship,\" Rosen says.\n\nWhat is the connection between birthright citizenship and immigration?\n\nIn 1898, 30 years after the 14th Amendment was adopted, the Supreme Court reached a defining decision in a case known as the United States v. Wong Kim Ark. Lee explains that Wong Kim Ark was the American-born son of Chinese immigrants.\n\n\"Asian immigrants were the first immigrants to the US that couldn't be considered white,\" Lee says. \"So they are treated differently. They are taxed differently, they are stripped of many rights. In the 1880s, they are excluded from immigration and barred from citizenship.\"\n\nSo, the main question of the case was, could a person born in America be a citizen in a place where his parents could not be as well? The Supreme Court decided yes, and the case remains the first defining legal decision made under the banner of birthright citizenship.\n\n\"[The Supreme Court's decision] said that the right of citizenship is not a matter of inheritance, that it never descends from generation to generation, it is related to where you're born,\" Lee says. \"It's about the power of place. That has been a very expansive, and at the time, a corrective measure to a more exclusionary definition both legally as well as culturally as to what an American is.\"\n\nWhy must it be stated that the privileges of citizenship need to be protected?\n\nBefore the Civil War, states didn't necessarily have to follow the provisions stated in the Bill of Rights; only Congress had to. The 14th Amendment changed that.\n\n\"This second sentence of the Amendment means that states have to respect the Bill of Rights as well as basic civil rights and the rights that come along with citizenship,\" Rosen says. \"The idea was that there were rights that were so basic; so integral to citizenship that they could not be narrowed by the states.\"\n\nDespite the promises and protections of citizenship, Lee says it is abundantly clear that different racial groups were, and often are, seen as unable or unworthy to function as true American citizens. After all, basic rights of citizenship, like suffrage and equal treatment, were denied certain racial groups for a hundred years after the 14th Amendment.\n\n\"The idea of a law applying to 'all people' seems to be clear. But in reality, the debate and the laws and practices that get established are very much based on a hierarchy of, well sure, all persons, but some are more fit and some are more deserving than others,\" she says.\n\nThroughout history, Asian immigrants, Mexican immigrants, Muslim immigrants and their children, to name a few, have had unspoken cultural caveats applied to their ability to be Americans.\n\n\"For Asian immigrants, the racial argument at the time was that 'It didn't matter whether one were born in the US or not, Asians as a race, are unassimilable. They are diametrically opposite from us Americans,'\" Lee says.\n\n\"That was the argument that was used to intern Japanese citizens. It was the denial of citizenship in favor of race: 'The ability to become American, the ability to assimilate, they just didn't have it.'\"\n\nWhy was it important to legalize rights for non-citizens?\n\nSo far, we've covered the first clause, the Citizenship Clause, and the second, the Privileges and Immunities Clause. These both deal with American citizens.\n\nThe final two clauses, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection clause, are a little different, and deal with the rights of all people in the United States.\n\nEagle-eyed Constitution readers will notice that the 14th Amendment contains a \"due process\" clause very similar to the Fifth Amendment. This, says Rosen, was a technical addition to ensure the Fifth Amendment wasn't theoretically narrowed down to protect only American citizens.\n\n\"The 14th Amendment distinguishes between the privileges of citizenship and the privileges of all people,\" Rosen says. \"The framers [of the amendment] thought there were certain rights that were so important that they should be extended to all persons, and in order to specify that they needed a new 'due process' clause.\"\n\nWhat does it mean to have 'equal protection of the laws'?\n\n\"At the time following the Civil War, at its core, it meant all persons had the right to be protected by the police, that the laws of the country should protect all people,\" Rosen says. \"In the 20th century, more broader questions were litigated under the 14th Amendment, like Brown v. Board of Education -- whether segregation was constitutional. Cases involving the internment of Japanese citizens, case from the marriage equality decisions, even Roe vs. Wade have strains of equal protection language and invoke due process law.\"\n\nAnother interesting case that speaks directly to the immigration side of the 14th Amendment debate is the 1982 case of Plyler v. Doe, in which the Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional for the state of Texas to deny funding for undocumented immigrant children.\n\nWhy are we talking about all this right now?\n\nThis week, Trump vowed to end the right to citizenship for the children of non-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on US soil.\n\nBut his interest in repealing birthright citizenship isn't a new idea. Lee says for the last 30 years or so, there have been several overtures by the political right to explore \"citizenship reform,\" a timeline that she says aligns with the ascendancy of modern American conservatism.\n\nLee fears if the current push to end birthright citizenship is successful, it could have wider implications than most people assume. People from other countries who are here legally on work or student visas, for instance, could have children who do not legally belong to the only country they know.\n\n\"There have been attempts since the 1990s to break away birthright citizenship, or narrow it down, and it did not seem that they would have a chance at succeeding until now,\" she says.\n\n\"To me this not only reflects the ascendancy of an extreme right position but also a return to a very narrow and exclusionary definition of Americanness.\"\n\nUPDATE: This article has been updated to conform with CNN's editorial style on the term \"undocumented immigrant.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nTrump reiter\u00f3 su idea de eliminar la ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento a trav\u00e9s de un decreto, aunque reconoci\u00f3 que prefiere hacerlo \"a trav\u00e9s del Congreso\"\n\nLas declaraciones ocurren un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que Ryan dijera que no se puede terminar con este derecho a trav\u00e9s de un decreto\n\nEl presidente Donald Trump public\u00f3 en su cuenta de Twitter que \u201cPaul Ryan deber\u00eda estar concentr\u00e1ndose en mantener la mayor\u00eda en vez de dar sus opiniones sobre la ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento\"\n\n(CNN) \u2013 El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, arremeti\u00f3 este mi\u00e9rcoles contra el l\u00edder de la mayor\u00eda en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes Paul Ryan, asegurando que el congresista republicano \"no sabe nada\" sobre la ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento y \u201cdeber\u00eda estar concentr\u00e1ndose en mantener la mayor\u00eda\u201d del \u00f3rgano legislativo \u201cen lugar de dar sus opiniones\u201d sobre el tema.\n\nLas declaraciones del mandatario ocurren un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que Ryan arrojara un baldado de agua fr\u00eda sobre la afirmaci\u00f3n de Trump acerca de que \u00e9l puede usar un decreto presidencial para eliminar la garant\u00eda constitucional de ciudadan\u00eda para cualquier persona que haya nacido en Estados Unidos.\n\nRyan le explic\u00f3 a una estaci\u00f3n de radio de Kentucky este martes que \u201cuno no puede terminar el derecho de ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento con un decreto presidencial\u201d, luego de los comentarios de Trump asegurando que puede hacer justamente eso, a pesar de que muchos expertos legales est\u00e9n en desacuerdo.\n\nEste mi\u00e9rcoles, el presidente public\u00f3 en su cuenta de Twitter: \u201c\u00a1Paul Ryan deber\u00eda estar concentr\u00e1ndose en mantener la mayor\u00eda en vez de dar sus opiniones sobre la ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento, algo de lo que no sabe nada!

But many people standing in them later learned they had no reason to be there.\n\nMore than 100 immigrants showed up to court carrying paperwork ordering them to appear before a judge, only to find out that their court dates hadn't actually been scheduled, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). And as a result, uncharacteristically long lines were reported outside at least 10 immigration courts, the association said.\n\nLawyers told CNN it's part of a troubling trend that shows how dysfunctional the system has become and how chaotic the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement can be.\n\n\"From a humanitarian point of view, it's sickening what you're seeing happening here, because they're toying with these individuals' lives in many cases. ... This is widespread, it's national and it's outrageous,\" said Jeremy McKinney, AILA's treasurer and an immigration attorney in North Carolina.\n\nAttorneys say the practice began after the US Supreme Court ruled in June that notices to appear -- the charging documents that immigration authorities issue to send someone to immigration court who's accused of being in the United States illegally -- must specify the time and place of proceedings in order to be valid.\n\nSince then, immigration lawyers across the country have reported that officials are increasingly issuing such notices with so-called \"fake dates,\" ordering immigrants to appear at hearings that, it later turns out, were never scheduled in immigration courts.\n\nIn recent months, lawyers have reported examples of notices issued for nonexistent dates, such as September 31st, and for times of day when courts aren't open, such as midnight.\n\nOn Wednesday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Daniel Hetlage said initial dates on notices issued by his agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are \"based on guidance on upcoming docket dates from local EOIR, an agency within the US Department of Justice responsible for administering the immigration courts.\"\n\nIn a joint statement released Friday, the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice said the confusion was a result of \"minor logistical errors.\"\n\n\"The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are working through minor logistical errors that resulted in a number of individuals appearing for immigration court hearings that were not docketed in accordance with regulatory requirements,\" the statement said. \"These errors will be resolved and will not prevent these cases from being docketed properly in a timely fashion.\"\n\nOfficials haven't responded to questions about why this occurred, how many people were affected and what steps they plan to take going forward.\n\nNotices issued for dates that don't exist, times when court is closed\n\nOn Wednesday, reports of the so-called \"fake date\" practice were far more widespread than previously observed, and attorneys reported seeing larger numbers of people affected, said Laura Lynch, AILA's senior policy counsel.\n\nAttorneys observed long lines at courts in Baltimore, Charlotte, Atlanta, Orlando, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Phoenix and San Diego. Immigrants with \"fake dates\" were also seen at courts Wednesday in Las Vegas and Denver, Lynch said, but lines there weren't as long.\n\nIn this screengrab from a handout video provided by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, people are seen lining up outside the Atlanta Immigration Court on October 31.\n\n\"The line was around the corner,\" said Jorge Gavilanes, an immigration attorney in Atlanta who witnessed the crowds gathering Wednesday. \"Security was unprepared for this. The court was unprepared for this. They were scrambling to check every single one of these cases to see if these cases have been already filed with this court.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time such situations have been reported.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News documented the practice occurring in court there in September\n\nIt may sound like a small bureaucratic glitch, Lynch said, but such mix-ups can take a significant toll on immigrants' lives.\n\n\"Clients are driving like eight hours and taking off of work in order to appear at these hearings, only to find out that it's not the actual correct hearing date. The impact is their jobs, it's their life, and also just the anxiety,\" she said.\n\nAttorney: 'People were obviously fearful'\n\nSometimes, lawyers say they're able to confirm with courts beforehand that certain noticed hearing dates aren't accurate, but then struggle to convince their clients not to show up in court anyway.\n\n\"They're so anxious to cooperate. They don't want any problems with ICE or with the authorities,\" says Rachel Effron Sharma, an immigration attorney in Atlanta who tried to explain the situation to clients this week. \"They got a letter telling them to go that day. They didn't understand how it would be possible that there would be a date that was just made up.\"\n\nGavilanes said he's found himself in a similar predicament, trying to reassure clients who know that if they don't show up for a scheduled court hearing, the consequences could be severe.\n\n\"People were obviously fearful that if they miss their hearing, they were going to get deported in their absence, and they didn't want to take that chance,\" he said. \"They'd rather show up at the court and have them tell them go home instead of not showing up and worry(ing) about it.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Gavilanes said he fielded questions from numerous immigrants who were baffled by the situation.\n\n\"I don't think people really understand why this is happening,\" he said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud recomienda a las mujeres esperar al menos dos a\u00f1os antes de volver a quedar en estado.\n\n(CNN) - Un nuevo estudio identific\u00f3 un moderado aumento en el riesgo de muerte o enfermedad grave en las mujeres embarazadas cuando entre una y otra gravidez transcurren menos de 12 meses.

Para las madres de entre 20 y 34 a\u00f1os, hubo un riesgo previsto de 0,23% a los seis meses y de 0,25% a los 18 meses.\n\nSin embargo, en comparaci\u00f3n con las mujeres de m\u00e1s edad, las madres m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes tuvieron un mayor riesgo de parto prematuro espont\u00e1neo con intervalos de embarazo m\u00e1s cortos (5,3% a los seis meses y 3,2% a los 18 meses) y mayores resultados adversos fetales e infantiles (2,0% de riesgo previsto a los seis meses, en comparaci\u00f3n con 1,4 % a los 18 meses)\n\nEste desglose es relevante porque la edad en la cual las mujeres estadounidenses est\u00e1n teniendo su primer hijo est\u00e1 aumentando, debido a los cambios en la sociedad y en los lugares de trabajo, de acuerdo con los autores de un editorial publicado junto al estudio.\n\n\"Es una pregunta bastante com\u00fan que surge ahora, porque para las personas como yo, que ven a muchos pacientes que tienen su primer beb\u00e9 a los 40 a\u00f1os, la primera pregunta generalmente \u2014si el embarazo concluye satisfactoriamente\u2014 es \"\u00bfcu\u00e1ndo puedo tener el pr\u00f3ximo?'\", dijo la Dra.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, made the announcement Wednesday in a video message posted to his website.\n\n\"This is sad. It's sad for all of us. It's sad for the victim and I sure appreciate that victim coming forward,\" Dolan said in the video message.\n\nBishop denies allegations\n\nJenik denied the allegations and sent a letter to Our Lady of Refuge Parish in the Bronx, where he has served since 1978.\n\n\"While I have the utmost respect for the [Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program] and the review board, and know that they have a great burden as they confront the evil of sexual abuse, I continue to steadfastly deny that I have ever abused anyone at any time,\" Jenik wrote.\n\nIn his letter, Jenik says he wants the Vatican to look over the matter \"with the hope of ultimately proving my innocence.\"\n\nThe details of the allegations have not been released by the Archdiocese of New York or the Bronx County District Attorney's Office.\n\nAlleged victim was a teenage boy\n\nMichael J. Meenan, 52, the alleged victim, told CNN he was 13 when he met Jenik at Our Lady of Refuge Church in the Bronx.\n\nMeenan said Jenik, who was a priest at the time, gained his trust after an emotional confessional in which he told Jenik about family problems he was having. That led to an inappropriate relationship that lasted until he was 18 years old, said Meenan.\n\n\"What this guy did to me he should get jail time,\" said Meenan.\n\nAfter the confession, Jenik would take him out alone a lot over the years, added Meenan. \"He would take me to restaurants, drinking and always to a faraway neighborhood. He liked to do what he called 'getting freaky' and eat things like fried jelly fish.\" He also took him to at least two movies that showed anal rape, according to Meenan.\n\nOver the years, Meenan said Jenik would often take the teenager to Jenik's house in Tivoli, New York, where they would stay alone. \"I would spend the night there every New Year's Eve, but we would always sleep in separate rooms,\" said Meenan.\n\nOne time, when Meenan was about 15, Jenik invited him to the house with other people and they stayed in the same bed. \"This time we were drunk and he put me in bed alone with him. He got into bed and began to grope me.\"\n\nAccording to Meenan, Jenik rubbed him up and down on both sides of his body and then put his mouth inches from the boy's mouth as if he was going to kiss him. Then Jenik put his head on Meenan's shoulder.\n\n\"It went on for about 20 minutes and I froze,\" said Meenan.\n\nCNN does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual abuse unless they choose to talk about it.\n\nLetter sent to parishioners\n\nDolan sent a letter to Our Lady of Refuge Parish on October 29 explaining the situation regarding Jenik. He told the parish he wanted the news to come from him and not secondhand or from the media.\n\n\"This is the first time any such allegation about him was ever made. Although the alleged incidents occurred decades ago, the Lay Review Board has concluded that the evidence is sufficient to find the allegation credible and substantiated,\" wrote Dolan. The Lay Review Board is made up of judges, attorneys, psychiatrists, psychologists, parents, child care experts and others, according to Dolan.\n\nIn the letter to parishioners, Dolan also explained that the Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program , or IRCP, is investigating. IRCP was established in 2016 in the New York archdiocese to assist victims and survivors of sexual abuse by a bishop, priest or deacon. IRCP is administered by outside experts who have pledged to also notify the district attorney.\n\nDolan also called for anyone else who may have \"any allegations or concerns about Bishop Jenik\" to come forward and contact the Bronx County District Attorney's Office.\n\nBronx DA spokeswoman Denisse Moreno told CNN the office was informed about the allegation from the archdiocese and it has already investigated, \"but the alleged incident happened beyond the statute of limitations.\"\n\nMeenan is applying for compensation for his abuse claim through the IRCP because it no longer falls within New York State's statute of limitations.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Steve King this week over his incendiary comments, learned what a growing number of corporate interests are discovering in a hyper-partisan America: It doesn't always pay to play in politics.\n\nFaced with a barrage of online criticism, the dairy-products cooperative and the pet-food giant abruptly withdrew their support for the eight-term Republican congressman on Tuesday -- just a week before the election. King's controversial comments about race, ethnicity and immigrant status have drawn fresh scrutiny in recent days, following the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead.\n\nBut the companies are just the latest to find themselves in the crosshairs of the public and activists by dint of their political contributions or views.\n\nEarlier this year, supermarket chain Publix suspended its political contributions after it faced critcism for giving to Adam Putnam, a candidate then seeking the Republican nomination for Florida governor, for his ties to the National Rifle Association. The grocery chain's move came as the survivors of a February shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, staged \"die-in\" protests at several of its stores in Florida.\n\nL.L. Bean, the Maine outdoor company famous for its flannel shirts and canvass tote bags, faced a backlash from some customers after a member of the Bean family, Linda Bean, emerged as a financial backer of President Donald Trump. On Twitter, Trump himself encouraged his supporters to \"Buy L.L. Bean.\"\n\nAn effort by a former marketing consultant in San Francisco, dubbed #GrabYourWallet, has called for boycotts of Trump-owned businesses or those run by people who back him. Earlier this year, three companies -- CVS Health, Dow Chemical and Southern Company -- said they would no longer donate to a pro-Trump nonprofit, America First Policies , after CNN and other news organizations reported racist comments made by the organization's staffers.\n\nAnd more recently, some Nike customers burned their shoes and cut Nike's famous \"swoosh\" off their clothing in response to an ad campaign featuring unsigned NFL player Colin Kaepernick. He enraged Trump and the President's conservative supporters by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality.\n\n\"The environment today is hyper-polarized and really very toxic,\" said Bruce Freed, who runs the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit that promotes greater political transparency at publicly traded companies.\n\n\"Consumers and employees are much more sensitive to what they see the company associated with through their political spending,\" he said. \"They'll move jobs or move dollar-wise in terms of their own spending\" if they disagree with a company's politics.\n\nLand O'Lakes and Purina officials did not respond to CNN interview requests Wednesday but issued statements this week, saying King's comments conflict with their corporate values. Officials with Intel, which announced over the weekend that it would no longer support King, declined to comment on the reasons behind the company's move.\n\nKing -- who faces a better-financed rival, Democrat J.D. Scholten on Election Day -- also drew a rebuke this week from Rep. Steve Stivers, who heads the House campaign arm.\n\nFor his part, King has blamed \"dishonest fake news\" for the criticism and said it was orchestrated to help flip the House to Democrats and engineer Trump's impeachment.\n\nBusiness as usual\n\nPolitical action committees associated with corporations long have donated to King, despite the immigration hard-liner's long history of racially and ethnically insensitive comments. (He once declared that Mexicans have \"calves the size of cantaloupes\" from carrying drugs across the US-Mexico border.)\n\nKing, who sits on the House agriculture committee, received more than a quarter of his contributions in this election cycle from PACs, including those associated with agribusiness, figures compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics show.\n\nIt's not surprising a major dairy interest such as Land O'Lakes would donate to King and other members of a committee that helps set the nation's farm policy. In all, the Minnesota-based company has contributed $12,000 to King since Jan. 1, 2008, including $2,500 this year, according to the Center's data.\n\n\"It makes sense for a company to give to those who have jurisdiction over their issues -- unless and until it becomes a liability,\" said Sheila Krumholz, who runs the center.\n\nKing sparked a greater backlash with his recent decision to endorse Toronto mayoral candidate Faith Goldy, who has espoused white nationalist views.\n\nJudd Legum, who writes the political newsletter Popular Information , said that endorsement sparked him to lead a social media campaign, urging companies to abandon King.\n\n\"Corporations have just gotten used to idea that they wouldn't be accountable for any of this,\" Legum said. \"These companies sell products in King's district, but they also sell products around the country and the world.\"\n\n\"A lot of people feel powerless in this political environment,\" Legum added.
