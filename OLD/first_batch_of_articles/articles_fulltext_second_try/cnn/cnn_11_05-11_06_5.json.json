Cerca de la capital del pa\u00eds para que, alg\u00fan d\u00eda, ella tambi\u00e9n tenga la oportunidad de votar.\n\nTres generaciones de su familia, hijos, nietos y bisnietos, condujeron en medio de una lluvia torrencial en el norte de Virginia para llevarla a tiempo este martes. Una hija vol\u00f3 desde California.\n\nSu familia tem\u00eda que Valles no lo lograra despu\u00e9s de sufrir dos ataques card\u00edacos en abril.\n\nPero Valles estaba radiante cuando la llevaron al edificio de oficinas de Fairfax con su nuevo vestido de terciopelo azul.\n\nSe sent\u00f3 en primera fila en la sala de ceremonias, junto a su bisnieta, Asia, de 7 a\u00f1os, que se apoyaba en su silla de ruedas y se re\u00eda mientras esperaban a que comenzara el acto.\n\nEscuchando el mensaje de Trump\n\nValles miraba atentamente un video de la exsecretaria de Estado Madeleine Albright que dio comienzo la ceremonia de naturalizaci\u00f3n.\n\n\"Cuando me preguntan sobre el acontecimiento m\u00e1s importante de mi vida\", dijo Albright, \"respondo que ser estadounidense\".\n\nHacerse ciudadana estadounidense era un sue\u00f1o de Valles desde hace a\u00f1os.\n\nOriginaria de El Salvador, obtuvo la residencia permanente de Estados Unidos hace unos seis a\u00f1os, despu\u00e9s de que uno de sus hijos la apadrinara. Seis de los hijos de Valles viven en Estados Unidos. La mayor\u00eda de ellos tambi\u00e9n son ciudadanos.\n\nCuando se reuni\u00f3 con un agente de USCIS para su entrevista de ciudadan\u00eda, Valles se acord\u00f3 de su familia.\n\n\"Le dijo al agente que el sue\u00f1o de su esposo era ser ciudadano estadounidense\", dijo Jim McKinney, portavoz de la agencia. \"Pero desafortunadamente, falleci\u00f3 antes de que pudiera hacerlo, por lo que ella se hac\u00eda ciudadana en representaci\u00f3n de los dos\".\n\nEste martes, inmigrantes de una decena de pa\u00edses se unieron a Valles en la oficina del distrito de Washington para prestar juramento y jurar lealtad al pa\u00eds.\n\nTambi\u00e9n se escuch\u00f3 un mensaje en video del presidente Trump.\n\n\"Este pa\u00eds es ahora tu pa\u00eds... Compartimos un coraz\u00f3n estadounidense y un destino estadounidense\", dec\u00eda en el video.\n\n\"Ahora compartes la obligaci\u00f3n de ense\u00f1ar nuestros valores a los dem\u00e1s\", continu\u00f3, \"para ayudar a los reci\u00e9n llegados a asimilar nuestra forma de vida\".\n\nLa ceremonia del martes, a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la Casa Blanca, tuvo lugar despu\u00e9s de d\u00edas de duras cr\u00edticas de Trump contra los migrantes de El Salvador y otros pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Central que viajan en caravanas en busca de asilo en Estados Unidos.\n\nPero Valles y su familia no estaban pensando en los mensajes de Trump.\n\n\"El presidente dice lo que piensa que es verdad. Siempre digo que los estadounidenses a quienes Dios les dio la oportunidad de nacer en este pa\u00eds no deber\u00edan pensar que alguien es menos solo por el lugar donde nacieron\", dijo Bernarda Bonilla, una de las hijas de los Valles. \"Cada persona piensa lo que quiere y lo respeto. Solo Dios sabe la respuesta correcta\".\n\n\"Aunque no seas tan joven, puedes hacerlo\"\n\nValles no es la persona de m\u00e1s edad que se hace ciudadana de Estados Unidos. El r\u00e9cord lo tiene una inmigrante turca que prest\u00f3 juramento a los 117 a\u00f1os en Los \u00c1ngeles en 1997.\n\nPero McKinney dijo que Valles es la persona m\u00e1s anciana que recuerdan en esa oficina del distrito de Washington.\n\n\"Aunque no seas tan joven, puedes hacerlo\", dijo Valles despu\u00e9s de la ceremonia del martes. \"Lo hice a esta edad\".\n\nEl agente de USCIS que entrevist\u00f3 a Valles y aprob\u00f3 su solicitud asisti\u00f3 a la ceremonia.\n\n\"Buena suerte\", le dijo el agente, F\u00e9lix Zamot, a Valles.\n\n\"Ella reza por ti todos los d\u00edas\", le dijo la nieta de Valles.\n\nLista para votar\n\nValles, que naci\u00f3 ocho a\u00f1os antes de que las mujeres obtuvieran el derecho a votar en Estados Unidos, y 38 a\u00f1os antes de que las mujeres votaran por primera vez en su pa\u00eds natal, El Salvador, nunca ha votado. Pero a ella siempre le ha fascinado ver a sus hijos y nietos votar en Estados Unidos.\n\nA pesar de que ya es ciudadana, Valles no pudo votar este martes. La fecha l\u00edmite para registrarse como votante en Virginia era a mediados de octubre.\n\nPero su familia dice que eso no frena su entusiasmo, y que tener la ceremonia el d\u00eda de las elecciones fue muy significativo.\"El tiempo de Dios es perfecto. Fue un d\u00eda perfecto. Es un d\u00eda de cambio\", dijo Bonilla, \"y un d\u00eda para cambiar su vida\".\n\nBonilla dijo que toda la familia de Valles est\u00e1 agradecida por cada d\u00eda que pasan con ella. Y esperan que en el futuro puedan llevarla a votar. \"Me gustar\u00eda un d\u00eda\", dijo Valles, \"si puedo\".", "(CNN) Children are most likely to become victims of stabbings as they walk home from school, a London study has found, as its authors warn of the \"endemic\" nature of knife crime among youths in the UK capital.\n\nThe risk of stabbing for children younger than 16 jumps significantly in the immediate hours after schools close, with crimes usually occurring close to a victim's home, according to research by doctors at Queen Mary University, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Open\n\nThe findings underline the worsening epidemic of violent crime in the city, where homicides have risen for the third consecutive year and have prompted calls for a greater focus on preventative techniques to tackle knife crime.\n\n\"There are children and young people exposed to violence literally on a daily basis, who are not members of gangs; they are just schoolkids,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Karim Brohi, a consultant trauma surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust. The figures demonstrate \"an endemic problem around school-based violence,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data on 1,824 people 25 or under who were treated for stab wounds at an east London trauma center between 2004 and 2014 and recovered incident times and locations from ambulance data and the hospital's registry.\n\nThey found that children under 16 were significantly more likely to be stabbed between 4 and 6 p.m. on a school day than young adults (between 20 and 24), with 22% of all child stabbings occurring between those times, compared with 11% in young adults.\n\nAlmost half of those stabbings occurred within 5 kilometers of the victim's home, they found. The majority of remaining stabbings occurred later in the evening, in line with other figures for young adults.\n\nAn overall increase in children seen at trauma centers for \"assault resulting in penetrating trauma\" saw an average increase of 25% each per year between 2004 and 2014.\n\nThe data also highlighted income inequalities in stabbing victims, with 71% of incidents occurring in poorer neighborhoods compared with just 1% in wealthier areas.\n\n\"People are carrying knives because they think they need it for protection,\" Brohi said. \"There is a general level of exposure to violence in young people. They are living with it in a way they haven't before.\"\n\nThe findings \"bring home the reality of knife crime,\" said Patrick Green, chief executive of UK knife crime charity The Ben Kinsella Trust, who was not involved in the study. \"People assume it's something that's done in the wee small hours. What [the data] shows is that it is part and parcel of daily life for young people.\"\n\n'It's become more common'\n\nThe study is the latest to highlight the increase in violent deaths in London in recent years.\n\nA fatal stabbing on Monday evening put the city's tally of homicides this year at 119, tying the highest annual number since 2010 when terror-related deaths are excluded, according to figures from the Metropolitan Police. Five fatal stabbings have been reported in London in the past week alone, according to the police.\n\nAcross England and Wales, knife-related crime is at its highest level since 2011, with the year ending March 2018 having seen a 16% increase from the previous 12 months, the Office of National Statistics says.\n\n\"Especially among young people, it's become part of their way of life,\" Brohi said. \"It used to be that the youngest person we'd see [for a stabbing] was 17 or 18; now, it's 12 or 13.\"\n\nThe problem has placed pressure on London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who told the BBC on Monday that it could take a decade until progress is made.\n\nThe issue has also received international attention, in part due to US President Donald Trump's comment in May that an unnamed London hospital was like a \"war zone,\" with \"blood all over the floors\" due to knife crime. Trump did not provide detail or evidence for his assertion.\n\nCalls for 'long-term approach'\n\nThe doctors behind the study said the findings highlight a need for a change in attitude and approach to youth knife crime.\n\n\"A long-term multi-agency and community approach is needed if we are to change the culture of violence that now permeates deprived areas of London,\" Brohi said, calling for \"thorough after-school activities and targeted policing.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGreen echoed calls for a preventative approach, saying, \"You can't just keep arresting people and the problem goes away. You have to concentrate on dealing with the causes.\n\n\"This issue is a national priority,\" he added. \"It is shocking that young people are put at risk when they are going to and from school.\"", "Despu\u00e9s de votar, los estadounidenses que acuden a las urnas reciben una pegatina o calcoman\u00eda, una tradici\u00f3n que existe desde la d\u00e9cada de 1980.\n\nLas calcoman\u00edas vienen en diferentes formas y tama\u00f1os, y si hubiera que darle un premio a la m\u00e1s bonita, se lo dar\u00edamos a la de Alaska.\n\nLas pegatinas de \"Vot\u00e9\" son una muestra de orgullo porque \"le dicen a la gente ... que tu comunidad te importa lo suficiente como para ir a votar\", dijo Patrick Race, el ilustrador de las calcoman\u00edas de Alaska.\n\nCNN pidi\u00f3 a la gente de todo el pa\u00eds que nos ense\u00f1ara sus pegatinas despu\u00e9s de votar.

The delay, congressional sources said, once again raised questions as to why the administration seems to be drag its feet on punishing Russia.\n\n\"Today, the Department informed Congress we could not certify that the Russian Federation met the conditions required by the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991,\" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a written statement.\n\nRep. Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Tuesday that \"no one should be surprised that Vladimir Putin refuses to swear off future use of weapons-grade nerve agents.\" And he blasted the administration for missing its own deadline.\n\n'It is unacceptable'\n\n\"It is unacceptable that the administration lacks a plan -- or even a timeline -- for action on the second round of mandatory sanctions required by U.S. law,\" Royce said in a statement.\n\n\"In recent years, Russia has engaged in a pattern of brazen poisonings -- including the March 14 nerve agent attack carried out on the soil of the United Kingdom\" against Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, Royce continued. \"The Trump administration needs to act quickly to uphold its own determination. Hesitation only encourages more Russian aggression.\"\n\nNauert said that the State Department is \"consulting with Congress regarding next steps as required 90 days after the initial determination on August 6, 2018.\" She added that \"we intend to proceed in accordance with the terms of the CBW Act, which directs the implementation of additional sanctions.\"\n\nIn September, a State Department official told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the agency would be ready to come down hard on Russia in November.\n\nActing Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Manisha Singh said at a September 14 House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing that \"we are well aware of the impending deadline on the second tranche of sanctions to be issued against Russia on the CBW.\"\n\nShe added that \"we are looking at this November deadline and absolutely we plan to impose a very severe second round of sanctions under the CBW. The global community will not tolerate behavior such as we have seen from Russia, especially in poisoning and killing its own citizens.\"\n\nRoyce had initially asked the administration in March to see whether Russia had violated the 1991 law. After the White House failed to respond, Royce wrote again in July, forcing the review that led to the August determination.\n\nThat request led the Trump administration to determine Russia was indeed responsible for the Skripal attack, which required that the US impose a first tranche of sanctions targeting certain US exports to Russia that could also have military uses.\n\nThe August determination started another countdown: within 90 days, the US had to get assurances from Russia that it was no longer using chemical or biological weapons, would not do so in the future and was willing to allow onsite inspections by impartial observers from the United Nations or another organization.\n\nIf Russia did not meet those demands, the US would then \"have to consider whether to impose a second tranche of sanctions as specified by the statute,\" a senior State Department official told CNN at the time.\n\nThe State Department did not comment Tuesday on whether a second tranche of sanctions will be announced over the next few days.\n\nCongressional committees were notified of the decision in a conference call with the State Department on Tuesday, a congressional source told CNN.", "Fairfax, Virginia (CNN) Maria Valles de Bonilla asked her granddaughter to buy her a new blue dress.\n\nShe wanted to wear something special for the occasion when a dream she'd had for so many years would come true.\n\nWhile voters were lining up at polls across the country to cast ballots in midterm elections, Valles, 106, lined up at a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office near the nation's capital so that someday she might have a chance to vote, too.\n\nThree generations of her family -- children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- drove through pouring rain that drenched northern Virginia on Tuesday to get her there on time.

We share one American heart and one American destiny,\" he said.\n\n\"You now share the obligation to teach our values to others,\" he continued, \"to help newcomers assimilate to our way of life.\"\n\nTuesday's ceremony, just miles from the White House, came after days of fierce criticism from Trump about migrants from El Salvador and other Central American countries who are traveling in large groups to seek asylum in the United States\n\nBut Valles and her family weren't dwelling on any messages from Trump.\n\n\"The President says what he thinks is the truth. I always say that American people who God gave the opportunity to be born in this country shouldn't think less of anyone just because of where they were born,\" said Bernarda Bonilla, one of Valles' daughters. \"Every person thinks what he wants, and I respect that. Only God knows the correct response.\"\n\n'Even if you're not that young, you can do it'\n\nValles isn't the oldest person to become a naturalized US citizen.

Good luck.\n\n\"She prays for you every day,\" Valles' granddaughter said.\n\nReady to vote after a 'day of change'\n\nValles -- who was born eight years before women got the right to vote in the United States, and 38 years before unconditional voting rights were granted to women in her native El Salvador -- has never cast a ballot. But she's always been fascinated by watching her children and grandchildren vote in the United States.\n\nEven though she's a US citizen now, Valles wasn't eligible to vote on Tuesday. Virginia's voter registration deadline was in mid-October.\n\nBut her family says that doesn't dampen their enthusiasm, and that having the ceremony on Election Day was particularly meaningful.\n\nValles was joined by her great-grandchildren Asia and Josh Cortes.\n\n\"God's timing is perfect. It was a perfect day. It is a day of change,\" Bonilla said, \"and a day of changing her life.\"\n\nBonilla said Valles' entire family is grateful for every day they spend with her. And hoping that in the future, they'll be able to take her to vote.\n\n\"I would like to one day,\" Valles said, \"if I can.\"", "Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in Washington and the author of the book \"The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness.\" Follow her on Twitter.

First, they made cities across the country grovel -- and throw tax breaks and other benefits their way -- for the opportunity to be the company's second headquarters. Now, it seems HQ2 may instead be a pair of satellite offices in near-to-DC Virginia and New York City.\n\nJill Filipovic\n\nThe prospect of this decision, first reported by The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and the process they have taken to get there tell us two things: First, Republicans can no longer lay claim to being a pro-business party, successful as they've been at making the states they control increasingly undesirable to modern businesses and workers. And second, Amazon -- and any big company -- isn't going to save American workers. They're going take what they can, and many will exploit where they can. Which is exactly why we need robust protections in place now to make sure that formidable companies work for the American public as much as their employees work for them.\n\nAmazon declined to comment to the Wall Street Journal report and didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on The New York Times report. The company has said it will complete its search for an HQ2 by the end of the year. And while a lot remains uncertain, and Amazon may yet come to a different decision, certain aspects of this still-TBD expansion are undeniable.\n\nAmazon has spent all year milling about ostensibly searching for an HQ2, looking at cities including Dallas, Miami, Nashville, Boston, Atlanta and Raleigh. After the company's boom laid waste to affordable housing in my hometown of Seattle, the company is looking to expand beyond the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAmazon has given generously to local Seattle homeless shelters. However, when the Seattle City Council initially passed a new tax to fund affordable housing and homelessness initiatives, Amazon and other Seattle-based corporations helped fund a campaign for a ballot measure to repeal it. Shortly thereafter, the council voted to reverse its vote on the new tax.", "(CNN) A federal judge may have given one of the planet's most endangered wolf species a glimmer of hope for survival.\n\nIn a searing decision aimed at the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Chief Judge Terrence W. Boyle ruled that the agency violated the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Protection Act by neglecting its duty to protect the rare North Carolina red wolf.\n\nThere are only an estimated 40 red wolves remaining in the wild, confined to a refuge spanning five counties in northeastern North Carolina.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Boyle wrote that the USFWS's decision to stop previously successful techniques for managing the red wolf population \"amount to a failure (to) comply with its affirmative duty,\" and that revisions to its red wolf management policy were overly influenced by public pressure to stop recovery efforts.\n\nThe judge, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, also made permanent a 2016 injunction which prevents the USFWS from capturing and killing red wolves without first showing that the animals are a threat to human, livestock or pet safety.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Some 58% said Democrats would better protect health care for those with pre-existing conditions, compared to 34% who said Republicans would.\n\nBut voters in several key Senate races were more willing to trust Republicans with these popular Affordable Care Act provisions -- even though in some cases, the GOP candidates actively supported dismantling the landmark health care law.\n\nTake Indiana, where Mike Braun defeated incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly. Hoosier State voters had equal confidence in Democrats and Republicans when it came to protecting those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nSame thing happened in Missouri, where Josh Hawley bested incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill. Hawley is among the attorneys general who have filed a lawsuit in Texas District Court seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act, including its protections.\n\nWhen it came to Trump's economic and immigration policies, voters in states sending Republicans to the Senate had more positive views than the national electorate. For instance, they generally felt their financial situations had improved from two years ago. And fewer felt the president's immigration measures were too tough.\n\n1:42 a.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nWho abandoned the incumbent Democratic senators in Indiana and Florida?\n\nRepublicans will keep control of the US Senate in large part because Democratic incumbents running in states won by President Donald Trump lost support among key groups that have backed the President. And this helped cost senators like Indiana's Joe Donnelly their jobs. Donnelly succumbed on Tuesday to Republican challenger Mike Braun.\n\nCompared to his first election in 2012, Donnelly lost the backing of men, those without college degrees and those making less than $50,000, in particular, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll.\n\nDonnelly saw his support among men slide 6 percentage points. He also saw a slide of 12 percentage points among those without college degrees and 11 percentage points among those making less than $50,000.\n\nIndiana voters skewed red this year, with more approving of President Donald Trump than the general electorate.\n\nMeanwhile, in Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson, another incumbent Democrat, was trailing challenger Republican Rick Scott and the race remained tight hours after polls closed. Regardless of the end-result, tonight's performance is a far different story for Nelson than 2012, when he won more than 55% of the vote.\n\nCompared to 2012, Nelson's backing among those over age 45 dropped 7 percentage points. It dropped 9 percentage points among men, 7 percentage points among whites and 8 percentage points among those without college degrees.\n\nJust over a majority of Florida voters approved of Trump, more than the electorate as a whole.\n\n10:45 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nYoung voters support the Democratic candidate in higher numbers than last midterm\n\nPreliminary CNN exit polls show voters between the ages of 18-29 reported supporting a Democratic candidate in the race for the House in higher numbers than in 2014. In the last midterm election, 54% of 18-29-year-olds voted Democratic while more than two-thirds said they voted for the Democrat so far in 2018.\n\nWhile all age groups have supported a Democratic candidate in higher numbers than the previous midterm election, according to the early exit polling, the jump among the youngest voters is around 14 percentage points while those in other age groups moved up less than 10 percentage points.\n\n9:24 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMost say Russia investigation is politically motivated\n\nSlightly over half of voters in the 2018 election said that the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is politically motivated, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll. Around 40% said that it's a justified investigation. President Donald Trump often refers to the investigation as a smear campaign and \"witch hunt.\"\n\nAround the same number who think the investigation is justified, about 40%, approve of the job Robert Mueller is doing handling the investigation, while slightly more disapprove of his job.\n\n8:14 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nAmericans more worried about voters being blocked from casting ballots\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly raised the specter of voter fraud, warning as recently as Monday that law enforcement will be watching closely for any illegal voting.\n\n\"Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday's Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Thank you!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThat's not in step with what worries Americans, however. More than half of voters said they were more concerned that people who should be able to vote will be prevented from doing so, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll.\n\nJust over a third said they were more concerned that people who shouldn't be able to vote will cast ballots.\n\nPrecincts in a multitude of states extended hours today because of voting issues.\n\nWhen it comes to foreign interference, half of voters said they don't think the government has done enough to protect this election, while just over one-third said enough has been done.\n\n8:08 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nVoters didn't support Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court\n\nAlmost half of voters opposed Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, according to preliminary data from CNN's national exit polls. A little over 40% supported his appointment. Around half of men supported Kavanaugh's confirmation compared to fewer than 40% of women who voted in this election, a significant gender divide.\n\nOn Roe v. Wade, two-thirds of 2018 voters said they would like to keep the landmark Supreme Court decision in place while only a quarter want it overturned. More than 80% said that sexual harassment is a very or somewhat serious problem in our country today and almost half said it's very serious.\n\n7:43 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nHigher support for Trump in some key states\n\nIn Indiana, around half of voters approve of the job Trump is doing as President around the same as in Missouri, slightly higher than the nationwide average. Both states feature tight Senate races where Democrats are trying to hold on to seats in states Trump won in 2016.\n\nVoters in Indiana and Missouri are split between whether their vote for Senate was in support of the President, opposition, or whether Trump isn't a factor in their vote. Around a third in both states said that their Senate vote was in opposition to Trump while around three-in-ten said it was in support of him or Trump wasn't a factor.\n\n7:38 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMixed views of Trump's agenda\n\nThe election was very much about President Donald Trump, as many voters cast their ballot specifically to oppose or support him. Similarly, reviews of his agenda and his accomplishments were mixed. About half of voters said that Trump's immigration policies are too tough, while around a third think they're just right and few, only about 15%, think he's not tough enough, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit polls.\n\nThe tax law passed by Republicans and touted by Trump hasn't had a lot of impact on American voters' personal finances, according to the poll. Close to half say they've seen no impact, while around three-in-10 said the law has helped and a quarter report the tax law has hurt them.\n\nFor his trade policies, which include new tariffs imposed on foreign countries and an update to NAFTA, about a third say they've had no impact on the economy in their area, but about 30% said that his trade policies have hurt them. A quarter indicate that his trade policies have helped their area's economy.\n\n6:34 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nExtremist violence was a factor in many votes in 2018\n\nAround three-quarters said that extremist violence is an important factor in their vote for the US House in 2018, according to preliminary CNN exit data, with a quarter who said it's the most important factor and half who said it's an important factor. Few said that extremist violence is a minor or not a factor to their vote.\n\nAnother three-quarters of 2018 voters said that Americans are becoming more divided politically. Fewer than one-in-10 think the country is becoming more united, and slightly more say the country is staying about the same.\n\n6:20 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nVoters want more women and racial minorities elected to public office\n\nAlmost 80% of voters said that it's very or somewhat important that more women be elected to public office and almost half said it's very important. Slightly more women than men placed a priority on electing more women to public office, but not by much.\n\nSlightly fewer but around seven-in-ten said that it's very or somewhat important for racial and ethnic minorities to be elected to public office. Around two-thirds of white voters said it's important to elect more minorities while around 80% of African Americans agreed.\n\n6:17 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMost voters, particularly Democratic voters, want major changes in health care\n\nIt's no surprise that health care was the top issue for most voters. Roughly four in 10 voters listed it as their top concern, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll.\n\nThis was especially true among Democrats.\n\nWhat is more surprising is that roughly seven in 10 voters said they wanted major changes to the nation's health care system, with more Democrats feeling this way than Republicans. Among voters who felt that health care needs minor, more were Republicans. More Democrats wanted no changes.\n\nThis is a huge swing from two years ago, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans saw their big wins at the polls as a mandate to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The effort ultimately failed, though the Trump administration continues to undermine the landmark health reform law through regulatory changes.\n\nThis election, however, revolved around retaining Obamacare's key provisions that protect those with pre-existing conditions. Democratic candidates repeatedly attacked their Republican rivals as jeopardizing the health insurance of millions of Americans who are or have been sick. The popularity of these Obamacare protections forced Republican candidates to promise to uphold these measures.\n\nMany voters weren't convinced. More than half said Democrats would better protect health care for people with pre-existing conditions, while only one-third said Republicans would.\n\n6:03 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated to reflect it was more Republicans and not a majority of Republicans who support minor changes and more Democrats support no changes to the health care law.\n\nNancy Pelosi more unpopular than Donald Trump\n\nThe Democratic Party has slightly higher favorability than the Republican Party in preliminary data from CNN's national exit poll. About half of voters said they had a positive view of the Democratic Party, while the Republican Party is upside down, with slightly more than 40% saying they had a positive view of the Republicans.\n\nThe downside for Democrats is an extremely low favorable rating for Nancy Pelosi, the woman who would like to again be Speaker of the House if Democrats win control of the House of Representatives. Only about three-in-10 voters had a positive view of Pelosi and more than half had an unfavorable view. In fact, more voters had an unfavorable view of Pelosi than had an unfavorable view of President Trump, according to preliminary results.\n\n-- 5:56 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMost voters feel good or great about the economy\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly highlighted how good the economy is doing under his watch.\n\nMany voters agreed. More than two-thirds said the economy is excellent or good, though Republicans were much more likely to feel that way, according to preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll.\n\nJust under a third of voters said the economy is not good or poor, and bof them were Democrats.\n\nThe economy, however, was not the key issue for many voters this midterm election. It ranked third, behind health care and immigration but well ahead of gun policy. The economy mattered more to Republicans than Democrats.\n\nNearly half of voters felt their financial situation is the same as it was two years ago. Just over a third said it was better, while a little less than 15% said it was worse.\n\nRepublicans were initially running on the tax cut package they passed at the end of 2017, though that fervor faded as the midterms approached. Voters were more muted about the tax cuts' effect on their lives. Nearly half said it had no impact, while just under a quarter said it hurt them. Just over a quarter said they were helped by the tax cuts.\n\n-- 5:50 p.m. ET / Tami Luhby\n\nCorrection: The percentage of Democrats saying the economy was not good or poor has been corrected.\n\nVoters decided a long time ago\n\nA big majority of voters, about two-thirds, made their 2018 election decision before the last month, according to preliminary exit poll results. Only one-in-five said they decided in the last month and even fewer said they made up their minds in the last few days or last week.\n\nAbout four-in-five have voted in a midterm election before, but about 15% said that this is the first time they've voted in a midterm. About 10% said they were first-time voters in the 2016 election.\n\n5:34 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nMore voted opposing Trump than supporting him\n\nMore than 40% of voters in the 2018 election approve of the job Trump is doing as President, according to the preliminary results from CNN's national exit poll. About three-in-10 said they strongly approve of Trump while almost half said they strongly disapprove of him.\n\nAlmost two-thirds said that Trump was a factor in their vote for the House today. About a quarter said their vote was in support of the President and almost 40% said that their vote was in opposition to him.\n\nA majority, a little more than half, said things in the country are on the wrong track. About 40% say they're going in the right direction.\n\n5:20 p.m. ET / Grace Sparks\n\nThis election is about Donald Trump\n\nTwo-thirds of voters say their vote in today's congressional election is about Donald Trump, according to early exit polls, and more say they're showing up at the polls to express opposition than support for the President. The President's approval rating is net negative among the nation's voters, and more say things in the country are on the wrong track than that they are going in the right direction. Still, nearly 7 in 10 say the economy is in good shape, and those who say their personal finances are in better shape now than two years ago outnumber those who feel their finances have worsened.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 voters turning out to vote across the country choose health care as the most important problem facing the country, and more, 7 in 10, say the nation's health care system needs major changes. About 2 in 10 each choose the economy and immigration as their top issue, and 1 in 10 say it's gun policy.\n\nWith a historically diverse slate of candidates on ballots nationwide, about half of voters say it's very important to them that more women are elected to public office and that more racial and ethnic minorities are elected.\n\nA sizeable 1 in 6 voters say this election is the first time they're casting a ballot in a midterm contest.\n\n-- 5 p.m. ET / Jennifer Agiesta", "(CNN) The US Border Patrol's El Paso Sector had planned a \"crowd control\" exercise on Election Day near the port of entry in the hometown of Democratic Rep.

Shanann Watts and her two little girls went missing from their home in Frederick, about 30 miles north of Denver, Chris Watts first told news cameras that they had gone to a friend's house.\n\nLater, as people searched for his missing family, Watts told CNN affiliate KMGH he had had an emotional conversation with his wife, Shanann, the last time he saw her. He gave no details about that talk, only saying, \"I just want them back.\"\n\nHe initially told law enforcement that on the morning of August 13 he told his wife he wanted to separate and then left for work.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) At least five Marines assigned to the prestigious ceremonial Silent Drill Platoon in Washington were placed in pretrial confinement in recent days due to allegations they were involved in hazing at least one Marine at the unit, according to three defense officials.\n\nHearings that took place this week resulted in one Marine being released from confinement but all could still face charges as the Naval Criminal Investigative Service has taken over the matter.\n\nThe number of alleged victims has not been made public but the allegations came to light when one Marine came forward. Officials say a video had been made allegedly showing some Marines hitting at least one other Marine. It is not publicly known if that victim is the Marine who came forward.\n\nThe platoon is a 24-man rifle unit that performs a drill exhibition largely in silence. It was founded in 1948 and performed for presidents and top officials as well as communities around the country tossing and spinning 10-pound M1 rifles with fixed bayonets.\n\nMultiple performances of the drill team were canceled in recent weeks due to the ongoing investigation, according to officials. The Marines did not publicize the reason for those cancellations or which performances were affected. The Marines said they began an investigation immediately at the unit, before turning it over the NCIS.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) When the lone voting machine on an island just off the coast of Rhode Island failed, state officials delivered a replacement -- by ferry.\n\nThe ballot-scanning machine at Prudence Island's polling site stopped accepting ballots Tuesday morning, according to Miguel Nunez, the state's deputy director of elections.\n\nVoting continued without disruption using a backup procedure, he told CNN.

Total revenue dropped 15.7% from a year earlier to about $364 million.\n\nFounder John Schnatter resigned his role as chairman in July after news broke that he had used the N-word on a conference call\n\n\"The negative publicity surrounding the company's brand that began in July 2018 has continued to impact the North America system-wide sales,\" Papa John's ( PZZA ) noted in its earnings release on Tuesday.\n\nSchnatter stepped down as CEO months earlier after he caused a controversy by blaming the NFL for poor pizza sales\n\nPapa John's has tried to make over its image with a new ad campaign featuring a diverse panel of franchisees and employees. The ad distances the company from Schnatter, who was once featured in Papa John's promotional materials. \"You've heard one voice of Papa John's for a long time,\" one employee says to the camera during the ad. \"It's time you heard from all of us,\" said another.\n\nThe \"campaign drove a modest improvement in traffic,\" and same-store sales were better in September than in July and August, CEO Steve Ritchie said during a Tuesday earnings call.\n\nIn addition to the ads, Papa John's took several steps to distance itself from the controversies.\n\nThe company is conducting an internal audit on diversity and inclusion practices, launching a program to support minority-owned franchises and starting a foundation focused on local communities. In August, it promised to help out struggling restaurant owners by cutting some royalties, food prices and online fees for the remainder of the year. The company also vowed to roll out mandatory bias training for its workers.\n\nThe training will start this month for its 14,000 team members, and should conclude in early 2019. Franchisees will also receive training.\n\nRitchie said the results were actually better than expected.\n\n\"During the quarter, we took important actions resulting in improved consumer sentiment and North America comp sales that were slightly ahead of expectations,\" he said.\n\nRitchie said pizza promotions available through the company's mobile app are helping sales. He also said a recent management reorganization, announced in October, sets the company up for success.\n\nThe company is \"committed to building on this momentum,\" he said.\n\nWhile it tries to revamp its image, Papa John's has been fending off fierce attacks from Schnatter.\n\nSchnatter accused the current leadership of allowing his comments to be misrepresented in the media. He has called Ritchie the wrong man for the CEO job , and said that he helped create a toxic culture rife with harassment and intimidation.\n\nA special committee of the Papa John's board responded to Schnatter's many claims in a scorching letter , accusing him of \"promoting his self-interest at the expense of all others in an attempt to regain control.\" Schnatter has said he regrets resigning as chairman, but that he doesn't want to regain his role as CEO.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors have been swirling that the pizza chain is looking for a buyer.\n\nOther pizza sellers have had a difficult quarter. Pizza Hut's sales were flat, and though Domino's ( DMZ ) reported domestic and international same store growth, it missed analyst expectations.\n\nPapa John's shares were up nearly 1% after the report.", "(CNN) Two-time super bowl champion and CNN Sport contributor Hines Ward shares his Week 9 takeaways with CNN's Jill Martin.\n\nHines Ward.\n\nWe're at the halfway point, and you start to see teams separate the contenders from the pretenders.

business skills made him uniquely qualified to run the world's largest economy.\n\nYet two years since Trump's election, it's clear the billionaire businessman has governed as the opposite of a modern CEO.\n\nCorporate America loves Trump's business tax cuts and deregulation, both of whichhave helped accelerate economic growth and send the bull market into overdrive.\n\nBut business can't stand Trump's populist instincts that have led to tariffs, a trade war with China and efforts to thwart immigration \u2014 despite a severe shortage of workers.\n\n\"Tariffs, trade wars and anti-immigration policies are anathema to business. They hate that,\" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management.\n\nAttacking business\n\nExecutives running America's biggest companies know that Trump could attack or demonize them at any time. The commander-in-chief has broken with precedent by attacking individual CEOs as well as some of America's largest employers.\n\nTrump has gone after everyone from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to Merck ( MRK ) boss Ken Frazier, one of the nation's most prominent black corporate leaders. He attacked Harley-Davidson and the NFL. That's not to mention the almost-constant condemnations of the press, including CNN, the New York Times, NBC and the Bezos-owned Washington Post.\n\nTrump is once again raising the prospect of cracking down on Silicon Valley. He has accused Google, Facebook ( FB ) and Twitter ( TWTR ) of trying to silence conservatives -- a claim all three companies deny. And Trump told Axios that his administration is looking into potential antitrust violations by Amazon, Facebook and Google.\n\nCorporate America has quite the rocky relationship with what was supposed to be one of the most business-friendly administrations ever. Even though few major CEOs supported Trump in the general election, nor the primary, they mostly rallied around him after his victory.\n\nCEOs like stability, not conflict\n\nTrump promised a pro-business agenda and unity.\n\n\"I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world,\" Trump said in his victory speech two years ago. \"That is now what I want to do for our country.\"\n\nBut Sonnenfeld said executives have become \"discouraged\" by Trump.\n\n\"He stands for conflict \u2014 they don't like conflict. They like stability and social harmony,\" said Sonnenfeld, who is also founder and president of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute , a nonprofit focused on corporate governance that surveys CEOs.\n\nTrump's leadership style is unlike that of almost any corporate executive, Sonnenfeld said. \"It's like Vince McMahon became president of the United States.\"\n\nTrade wars and inflation\n\nCorporate America has gotten some things it wanted out of this administration.\n\nTrump's tax cuts sparked a stock market boom in late 2016 and 2017 as well as record profits and stock buybacks this year.\n\nBut while Trump campaigned on his CEO cred, he also wrapped himself in populism and has governed in many ways antithetical to business.\n\nThe Trump bump in the stock market has started to fade as the buzz of the tax cuts' stimulus has lessened. After spiking in 2017, the market has become more turbulent. Investors fear that those same tax cuts may force the Federal Reserve to aggressively raise interest rates to prevent inflation from getting too hot\n\n\"The economy really needs to slow to avoid a dangerous overheating,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote to clients this week.\n\nThat's why Goldman Sachs is calling for five more rate hikes from the Fed, or roughly two more than Wall Street is anticipating.\n\nLikewise, corporate earnings calls are littered with complaints about tariffs and spikes for raw material costs. Trade war fears have contributed to market turbulence.\n\n\"The Trump administration's agenda in the first year was very pro-growth, and stocks reacted accordingly,\" Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, wrote to clients. \"The second year has seen an emphasis on policies that can run counter to economic growth \u2014 primarily protectionism \u2014 and stocks have posted very different returns thus far this year.\"\n\nNow CEOs are wondering whether year three will bring back a return of pro-business Trump or if populist Trump will win out.", "Story highlights Red Star Belgrade defeat Liverpool 2-0\n\nMilan Pavkov scores twice\n\nWin is Red Star's first in Champions League for 26 years\n\n(CNN) Two first-half goals from Red Star Belgrade striker Milan Pavkov consigned last year's beaten finalists, Liverpool, to a shock Champions League defeat in the Serbian capital.\n\nLiverpool thumped Red Star 4-0 in the reverse fixture at Anfield two weeks ago but the tables were turned early on in Belgrade as the home side took control.\n\nA deflected Andy Robertson cross struck the Red Star crossbar in the second period while Mohamed Salah struck the post with a shot from the edge of the box.\n\nBut Red Star were worthy of the victory -- the first they have claimed in the Champions League for 26 years -- in front of a noisy and passionate home crowd in the Rajko Mitic Stadium.\n\nRed Star Belgrade's Serbian forward Milan Pavkov celebrates after scoring against Liverpool.\n\nLiverpool midfielder James Milner told UK broadcaster BT Sport that Liverpool

York Times reported Amazon was close to a deal to split HQ2 between the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York, and the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nThe unexpected news raises many questions.\n\nWhen announcing its search for HQ2, Amazon promised as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs and said the project would cost $5 billion. The new facility was also touted as a \"full equal\" to its Seattle campus.\n\nThe 50,000 promised jobs will be dividedbetween two places, according to The Wall Street Journal . But it's unclear if Amazon's $5 billion investment will be split between the locations, if the two locations will be true equals and whatthat means for the incentive packages offered by cities.\n\n\"I am not sure how this will play out in the public after having this beauty contest across 200 plus locations and promising so much investment and jobs,\" said Nathan Jensen, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin. \"This could feel like a bait and switch for some cities.\"\n\nBut the move to split the project could have benefits.\n\nOne of the major concerns about the HQ2 process was how a city would handle the arrival of 50,000 new workers.\n\n\"Splitting it in half blunts the negative impact of having to absorb that much new capacity,\" said John Lettieri, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a policy and advocacy organization. \"It's still a pretty large influx of jobs and investments, but it may be less disruptive.\"\n\nThe two-city strategy also means Amazon can cherry pick the best aspects of each region it selects, such as tapping into two different talent pools. The Wall Street Journal reported the rationale behind selecting two cities is to recruit enough technical workers.\n\nSelecting two sites could also help Amazon skirt some of the responsibility for higher housing prices or more traffic occurring in those areas.\n\n\"I suspect that Amazon gets more blame for Seattle's issues with congestion because of Amazon's size,\" said Tim Bartik, senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. \"If there were 20 different employers that summed to the size of Amazon, probably there would be less blame, because there wouldn't be one employer to focus on.\"\n\nBut even with fewer jobs, the winning cities will still have to address issues like rising home prices, cost of living increases and infrastructure challenges. How difficult that will be depends on the city's proposal and how prepared it is.\n\n\"The details matter so much here,\" said Lettieri. \"What are we giving up in terms of incentives? What local capacity do we have to make absorbing that new investment and jobs more seamless and smooth for local residents?\"\n\nFor example, Long Island City has experienced a dramatic rise in home prices over the years that could be exacerbated by Amazon.\n\n\"This is a rapidly growing area,\" Elizabeth Lusskin, President of the Long Island City Partnership, told CNN Business. \"These are real issues that exist in cities everywhere, it's nothing new. ... We need to have a healthy mixed income city, and that's something lots of people are grappling with.\"\n\nShe declined to comment about whether Long Island City is one of the cities nearing a deal with Amazon.\n\nOf course, choosing two locations for HQ2 was always a possibility.\n\nAmazon's document requesting bids for the new facility said the company \"may select one or more proposals and negotiate with the parties submitting such proposals before making an award decision, or it may select no proposals and enter into no agreement.\"\n\nA final decision is expected this year.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nBennett tampoco dispar\u00f3 bengalas durante las horas que estuvo esperando a que la Guardia Costera lo rescatara, dijeron los fiscales\n\nLa muerte de Hellman se debi\u00f3 en parte a la \"negligencia grave de su marido, que equivale a una indiferencia imprudente por la vida humana\", dijeron los fiscales\n\n(CNN) - Lewis Bennett y su esposa Isabella Hellman acababan de recibir a una nueva hija cuando zarparon en abril pasado con la intenci\u00f3n de navegar desde St. Maarten a Florida en un catamar\u00e1n llamado \"Surf Into Summer\".\n\n\n\nMIRA: Descubren embarcaci\u00f3n que naufrag\u00f3 hace 2.400 a\u00f1os en el Mar Negro\n\nBennett era el capit\u00e1n, un experto nadador y marinero. Su esposa era una nadadora d\u00e9bil con menos experiencia en la navegaci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan documentos de la corte. A diferencia de su esposo, ella no estaba capacitada para manejar emergencias, dicen los fiscales.\n\nDos semanas despu\u00e9s del viaje, hubo una emergencia despu\u00e9s de que salieron de Cuba. Bennett inform\u00f3 que su esposa hab\u00eda desaparecido en una llamada de socorro a la Guardia Costera, quien lo rescat\u00f3 de una balsa salvavidas a unos 48 kil\u00f3metros al oeste de Cay Sal, Bahamas, no lejos de Cuba en mayo de 2017. El cuerpo de Hellman nunca fue encontrado.\n\nEste lunes, Bennett, de 41 a\u00f1os y ciudadano de Australia y el Reino Unido, se declar\u00f3 culpable de homicidio involuntario por la muerte de su esposa. El acuerdo de culpabilidad se cerr\u00f3 luego de que los fiscales originalmente buscaron un cargo de asesinato en segundo grado contra Bennett, quien iba a ir a juicio en diciembre.\n\nEl abogado de Bennett, Edward Downey, declin\u00f3 hacer comentarios el lunes.\n\nLa muerte de Hellman se debi\u00f3 en parte a la \"negligencia grave de su marido, que equivale a una indiferencia imprudente por la vida humana\", dijeron los fiscales.\n\nNo exigi\u00f3 que su esposa usara un chaleco salvavidas o arn\u00e9s a pesar de su inexperiencia, ni despleg\u00f3 bengalas o gir\u00f3 el bote para buscarla cuando no pudo encontrarla, dijeron los fiscales.\n\n\"Lewis Bennett ahora ser\u00e1 responsable por la muerte de su esposa en alta mar\", dijo Tom Jones, agente especial interino a cargo de la oficina del FBI en Miami, en un comunicado de prensa.\n\nMIRA: Arque\u00f3logos encontraron un naufragio en Portugal que ser\u00eda el \"descubrimiento de la d\u00e9cada\"\n\nBennett \"no dispar\u00f3 bengalas\", dicen los fiscales\n\nTemprano el 15 de mayo de 2017, un fuerte ruido despert\u00f3 a Bennett, quien hab\u00eda pedido a su esposa que se encargara de la guardia nocturna, dijeron los fiscales. Bennett not\u00f3 que las velas y el aparejo estaban sueltos, y vio que su esposa no estaba en los controles, dijeron los fiscales.\n\nBennett \"no pod\u00eda recordar si\" grit\u00f3 el nombre de su esposa, dijeron los fiscales.\n\n\"Aunque el Sr. Bennett lanz\u00f3 un flotador por la borda, no despleg\u00f3 bengalas para iluminar el \u00e1rea para buscar a su esposa o para se\u00f1alar su posici\u00f3n, ni tampoco gir\u00f3 el catamar\u00e1n para buscarla\", dijeron los fiscales.\n\nBennett tampoco activ\u00f3 de inmediato una baliza de localizaci\u00f3n personal o us\u00f3 un tel\u00e9fono satelital para enviar se\u00f1ales o pedir ayuda a Hellman, dijeron los fiscales.\n\nArroj\u00f3 varios art\u00edculos en su balsa salvavidas, incluida una maleta, dos bolsas de lona, \u200b\u200bagua, comida y monedas de plata, y luego abandon\u00f3 el catamar\u00e1n, dijeron los fiscales.\n\nBennett estim\u00f3 que hab\u00edan transcurrido aproximadamente 45 minutos a una hora desde el momento en que se despert\u00f3 hasta que abandon\u00f3 el catamar\u00e1n, dijeron los fiscales.\n\nBennett hizo dos llamadas de emergencia con la radio del catamar\u00e1n, pero no fueron exitosas, dijeron los fiscales.\n\nA bordo de la balsa salvavidas, us\u00f3 un tel\u00e9fono satelital y activ\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o dispositivo de transmisi\u00f3n con bater\u00eda para pedir ayuda e informar que su esposa hab\u00eda desaparecido, dijeron los fiscales.\n\nBennett tampoco dispar\u00f3 bengalas durante las horas que estuvo esperando a que la Guardia Costera lo rescatara, dijeron los fiscales.\n\n\"Aunque inicialmente intent\u00f3 remar en la balsa salvavidas para buscar a su esposa, la balsa fue dif\u00edcil de controlar, y ten\u00eda miedo de volcarse si la usaba, as\u00ed que abandon\u00f3 sus esfuerzos\", dijo la fiscal\u00eda.\n\nMIRA: Conoce a la familia que lleva una d\u00e9cada en el mar\n\nLa Guardia Costera busc\u00f3 a Hellman durante tres d\u00edas antes de suspender la b\u00fasqueda.\n\nBennett dijo a las autoridades en ese momento que el bote golpe\u00f3 algo mientras estaba dormido, y el barco comenz\u00f3 a llenarse de agua.\n\nEn febrero, las autoridades acusaron a Bennett de asesinato en segundo grado.

after Sean Hannity, the network's star host, campaigned with President Donald Trump on Monday night ahead of the midterm elections, more than half a dozen employees told CNN Business.\n\n\"People throughout the company think a new line was crossed,\" one senior Fox News employee told CNN Business on Tuesday.\n\n\"It disturbs me to my core,\" said another senior Fox News employee, who added, \"I am so f---ing mad.\"\n\n\"We were all told that Hannity was going to interview the president, but no one that I spoke with expected what happened last night,\" added a third senior Fox News employee. \"I'm aghast as are a number of other people.\"\n\nThe Fox News employees all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.\n\nSome of Fox News' biggest names, including Hannity, the hosts of \" Fox & Friends ,\" and Jeanine Pirro \u2014 who also appeared with Trump on stage Monday night \u2014 have turned into full-time Trump supporters on television over the past two years. Some, like Hannity, Pirro and Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs, reportedly even act as unofficial advisers to Trump at times. But Monday night's rally crossed a new line, making explicit what had long been implicit.\n\nThe Trump campaign had promoted Hannity over the weekend as a \"special guest\" at Trump's final rally before Tuesday's midterm election. But a Fox News spokesperson told CNN Business and other news outlets soon after that Hannity would simply be at the rally in Missouri to broadcast his show and cover the event for the network. Hannity offered an identical message in a Monday morning tweet, saying, \"To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the president.\"\n\nYet just hours later, Hannity and Pirro were both on stage with Trump, energizing the Republican base ahead of Election Day.\n\nAfter having expressly denied that he would be campaigning on stage with the President, the first move from Hannity when he walked on stage was to slam members of the media stationed at the back of the auditorium as \"fake news,\" apparently not realizing -- or caring -- that Fox News journalists were among the \"people in the back\" that he had insulted.\n\nOne Fox News employee described to CNN Business the scene at the New York headquarters of Fox News at the time, as a number of journalists inside the company's news division watched the episode unfold live. The person said that the employees were dismayed at what they saw.\n\nOther Fox News employees questioned why network executives have not taken any action.\n\n\"The whole thing is just so embarrassing that this guy basically has free rein to do whatever he wants, and management is either helpless or uninterested in doing anything about it,\" said one Fox News employee.\n\nAnother employee said that Hannity's behavior, both Monday night and generally, \"continues to make the task of the news side all that much harder.\"\n\nOne former senior Fox News employee told CNN Business that he had spoken to a number of former colleagues who are still at the network about the matter. He described them as \"livid.\"\n\nIn a Tuesday afternoon statement, a Fox News spokesperson said, \"Fox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events. We have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed.\"\n\nAsked by CNN Business exactly how the matter had been addressed, the spokesperson declined to elaborate.\n\nHope Hicks, chief communications officer for Fox \u2014 the soon-to-be parent company of Fox News \u2014 did not respond to a Tuesday morning email asking whether Rupert or Lachlan Murdoch, the father and son who control Fox News, had any comment on or approved of Hannity's behavior.\n\nHannity, for his part, released a statement on Twitter saying, \"What I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful. When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president's request. This was NOT planned. And to be clear, I was not referring to my journalist colleagues at FOX News in those remarks. They do amazing work day in and day out in a fair and balanced way and it is an honor to work with such great professionals.\"\n\nHannity has for years flouted the usual standards required of Fox News employees. In 2016, for instance, he cited unscientific polls on-air after a Fox News executive told network producers that they did not meet the company's editorial standards.\n\nBut Monday night's appearance at Trump's rally was one of the clearest examples to date of Hannity's growing invincibility at the network.\n\nWhile Hannity has been able to get away with breaking normal protocol, the network had previously attempted to rein him in.\n\nWhen he appeared in a Trump 2016 campaign ad, a Fox News spokesperson said the network \"had no knowledge\" of Hannity's participation and said he would \"not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election.\"", "\u0646\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0643\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a

floor because that equates a majority of the 435-member chamber.\n\nBut it's still possible for a candidate to win without getting there. And it's happened before.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThe top contenders for speaker among Democrats (Nancy Pelosi) and Republicans (Kevin McCarthy) are no guarantee for the job due to some dissension within their respective ranks.\n\nSo, for example, if Democrats win the House by a five-vote margin, 220-215, then Pelosi could only afford to have two Democrats vote against her (which entails voting for another person) and still become speaker with 218 votes. If she loses three or more, she won't get a majority of the House, assuming all members are present.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The national media is treating the 2018 midterm election like it's a presidential election, with TV and digital coverage to match.\n\nAnd there are good reasons why. Voter interest is sky-high. The early vote is explosive. And President Trump's campaign trail rhetoric is apocalyptic.\n\n\"In my 25 years of election coverage at CNN, we have never seen interest in a midterm election in the way we are seeing it this year,\" CNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist said.\n\n\"We see that interest in elevated television ratings when we cover political stories; we see it in our web traffic; and of course we see record early voting,\" Feist said. \"It's certainly looking like this is a Midterm for the record books.\"\n\nReporters -- and Trump's allies -- have been framing the election as a referendum on the Trump presidency. So here's what major news outlets have in store.\n\nNetworks add extra hours of coverage\n\nOn cable, the nonstop live coverage has already been happening for hours. Every CNN newscast is live from the network's DC bureau. The special election night broadcast begins at 5 p.m. ET, one hour before the first polls close in Kentucky.\n\nFox News and MSNBC's specials start at 6 p.m. ET. Those broadcasts will be based in New York.\n\nFox built a temporary studio and interactive space outside its midtown headquarters for the midterms. And NBC has brought back \"Democracy Plaza,\" its patriotic name for Rockefeller Plaza at election time. Results will be displayed on top of the famed skating rink.\n\nThe ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center on Nov. 8, 2016\n\nThe cable news channels will be live all night and through the next day. But they'll be competing for viewers against NBC, ABC and CBS to a much greater degree than in past midterm years.\n\nIn 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014, those three broadcast networks usually scheduled one hour of prime time coverage. There were short cut-ins earlier in the evening, and live streams on the web, but that was it -- an hour of prime time.\n\nThis year is different. NBC, ABC and CBS will all be live from 8 p.m. until 11 p.m. The New York-based anchors will continue into the wee hours for the west coast. Coverage could continue even after 2 a.m. ET.\n\nOn CBS, there's a twist: Stephen Colbert is hosting a live edition of \"The Late Show\" at 11:35 p.m. ET to react to whatever happens in the election.\n\nABC News has a brand new set at its New York headquarters in the Upper West Side -- a shift from past election nights in Times Square. Anchors will use augmented reality technology to display balance of power updates.\n\nNBC and CBS have transformed their morning show studios into election-themed sets.\n\nKeeping track of hundreds of races is an exciting challenge for networks and major newspapers. Most major networks now have a version of the \"Magic Wall\"-- a touchscreen board pioneered by CNN a decade ago.\n\n\"Telling the story of the House is always a challenge because we have to keep track of 435 separate races - most of which do not have household names,\" Feist said. So \"we have completely reprogrammed the magic wall in order to help keep track of the house. We have given John King a new set of tools to track each competitive house race.\"\n\nLocal newscasts and websites will drill down in even more detail. In Texas, where the Senate race has been hotly contested, the nonprofit news outlet The Texas Tribune has partnered with a local TV station to produce a live stream for election night.\n\nPartisan media united on get-out-the-vote efforts\n\nSince 2016, there's been a rise in point-of-view media outlets on the left -- partly in an attempt to match the conservative media universe on the right.\n\nNew outlets like Crooked Media, the progressive media company created by former Obama aides, have been prioritizing get out the vote efforts. Crooked produced a website spin-off of its \"Pod Save America\" podcast called \"Vote Save America,\" full of information about why and how to vote.\n\nOn the right, radio hosts and pro-Trump Twitter celebrities have been imploring their audiences to vote, too.\n\nRush Limbaugh made his case on his radio show on Monday afternoon and then repeated it at Trump's Monday evening rally.\n\nFox's Sean Hannity broadcast live from the rally in what was essentially a GOP infomercial. Then he stepped up on stage with Trump , despite his earlier claim that he wasn't there to campaign for the president.\n\nHannity's colleague Jeanine Pirro also appeared on stage. She told viewers, \"If you want to see Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi for the next two years, in your face, don't go out and vote.\"\n\nPartisan outlets on both sides are promising many hours of live-streamed coverage.\n\nThe digital network \"The Young Turks,\" which championed the candidacy of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez ahead of her surprise primary victory earlier this year, has a 1 p.m. start time on Tuesday.\n\nAnd The Gateway Pundit is promoting \"election night coverage\" hosted by Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nBut if history is any guide, most voters will tune in to major networks -- remote in one hand, cell phone in the other, refreshing for results until the late hours.", "\u0628\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 10 \u0623\u0633\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0639 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627.. \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062e\u0633\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646\u060c \u0641\u062d\u0642\u0642\u062a \u0625\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644\u060c \u0644\u062a\u0641\u0631\u0636 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0628\u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0635\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0629.. \u0641\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0629\u061f\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 06 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "(CNN) Measles has been diagnosed in 17 children in the Orthodox Jewish community in the Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods in Brooklyn, the New York City Department of Health stated Friday.\n\nSome of the infected children, who range in age from 7 months to 4 years, have experienced complications including hospitalizations, but there have been no deaths. Three of the children were infected on a visit to Israel, where there is a large outbreak of the disease, the department stated.\n\nAs of Sunday, Israel's Ministry of Health counted 1,334 measles patients, including a toddler who died from the illness last week. The ministry believes that the disease was imported by tourists and visitors who infected an unvaccinated population, largely among the nation's ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities.\n\nPreventing the illness\n\nFor every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Brooklyn, most of the children probably acquired the infection in school, according to the Department of Health. Spokeswoman Danielle De Souza wrote in an email that \"14 of our 17 cases were unvaccinated at the time of exposure.\"\n\nWhen a large percentage of the population is vaccinated, \"herd immunity\" will protect against the spread of disease among the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, including babies. The CDC recommends the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine for all children at age 12 months, with a second dose at 4 to 6 years old.\n\nThe problem in the Brooklyn outbreak is delayed vaccination or children not receiving the MMR vaccine at 12 months old, De Souza said: \"This outbreak would not have happened if the children had been vaccinated on time.\" However, she also noted that \"overall in NYC, our vaccine coverage is high as is compliance with the school immunization requirements.\"\n\nThe CDC also recommends that everyone, including infants 6 to 11 months old, should be vaccinated before international travel.\n\nEurope is also experiencing a rise\n\nEurope is also experiencing high numbers of measles cases, according to the European CDC . As of October 5, most of the cases in the EU were reported from Romania (5,088 cases, with 33 deaths), France (2,702, with 3 deaths), Greece (2,289, cases with 2 deaths) and Italy (2,248 cases, with 6 deaths). Outbreaks continue to affect Greece, Ireland, Romania and Slovakia, according to the ECDC.\n\nPoland's Ministry of Health reported 128 cases of measles this year as of October 15, a sharp increase from the 58 cases reported during the same period in 2017. The agency believes that the outbreak has been controlled and that the nation's population is adequately vaccinated against the disease.\n\nUkraine, which is not part of the European Union, is also experiencing an outbreak, with over 31,000 cases reported in 2018, including 14 deaths. Serbia, also not part of the EU, has seen 5,741 cases, including 15 deaths. An ongoing outbreak has also been reported in Russia.\n\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization European Region , which includes Russia, Serbia and Ukraine, reported more than 24,000 cases of measles, compared with just 5,000 cases in 2016. During the first six months of 2018, more than 41,000 children and adults have been infected with measles. WHO is concerned that low vaccination rates are to blame for the record number of measles cases across the European region.\n\nIn the United States, a rise in unvaccinated children was reported by the CDC last month . Unvaccinated children under age 2 rose from 0.9% among those born in 2011 to 1.3% among those born in 2015, according to one report. By comparison, only 0.3% of kids between 19 and 35 months had received no vaccine doses in 2001.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"None of the Brooklyn cases has as of yet, caused any cases outside of Brooklyn,\" De Souza said. Meanwhile, NYC's Health Department is raising awareness in the Orthodox Jewish communities of Brooklyn by sending notifications to religious schools, placing ads in newspapers and distributing health care posters and literature. Additionally, local health care providers and hospitals have been notified of the outbreak, and vaccine doses have been provided to doctors and clinics.\n\nBetween June 2009 and June 2010 , the US experienced an outbreak of mumps affecting 3,502 people, most of them students and most Orthodox Jews in New York City, two upstate counties and one New Jersey county. In that outbreak, a majority of the students with documented vaccine status had received both doses of the MMR vaccine, so health officials suggested that intense, face-to-face interactions in classrooms enabled the spread of disease.", "\u0623\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629

commercial LED maker Current to private-equity firm American Industrial Partners.\n\nGE did not disclose a sale price for Current. Analysts said that suggests the unit, which was put up for sale a year ago, fetched an insignificant sum. The deal marks an unceremonious ending for a business that GE launched just three years ago as a next-generation energy efficiency solution for companies.\n\nLED pricing has come under heavy pressure and Current generated just $900 million of sales during the first nine months of 2018. In addition to LED technology, Current makes sensors, controls and software for customers that include Walmart ( WMT ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ). As part of the proposed sale, Current will keep using the iconic GE brand under a licensing agreement.\n\nCurrent's new home will be American Industrial Partners, a New York-based private equity firm focused on improving industrial companies.\n\n\"The firm's deep expertise in operations and engineering, combined with its highly successful track record of industrial business investments, would help us accelerate Current's growth,\" Current CEO Maryrose Sylvester said in a statement.\n\n\"GE remains actively engaged in the process to sell this business,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nGE's financial problems -- debt is too high and earnings are shrinking -- have forced the conglomerate to dismantle itself in a bid to raise $20 billion.\n\nIn recent months, GE has agreed to sell its century-old locomotive division and announced plans to spin off GE Healthcare , which makes MRI machines. GE also reiterated plans last week to eventually exit its majority stake in the oil-and-gas giant Baker Hughes.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, GE finalized the $3.25 billion sale of its distributed power business to private equity firm Advent International. The sale of the unit, which makes gas engines that are used to generate electricity in remote places, was first announced in June.\n\nThe flurry of dealmaking is a sign that new CEO Larry Culp is working hard to repair GE's balance sheet.\n\nWall Street has grown frustrated with the speed of GE's turnaround, which began under former CEO John Flannery. The stock, trading near nine-year lows, has declined nine straight days. GE has lost 45% of its value this year. That's the third-worst performance in the entire S&P 500 and mirrors GE's 2017 loss.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEs un poco extra\u00f1o que los dos partidos hayan abrazado a sus mascotas con tanto entusiasmo\n\nNota del editor: Este art\u00edculo se public\u00f3 en colaboraci\u00f3n con Artsy, la plataforma global para descubrir y coleccionar arte.

Algunos han sugerido que la palabra \"desagradable\" (\"nasty\", en ingl\u00e9s) deriva del apellido del artista, y si bien esto es casi seguro que no es cierto, una mirada a sus dibujos podr\u00eda convencernos de que lo es.\n\nLos historiadores han afirmado que Nast, quien creci\u00f3 en la ciudad de Nueva York en los a\u00f1os 1840 y 50, fue acosado ferozmente de ni\u00f1o. De hecho, los dos temas que recorren su carrera son su desprecio desde\u00f1oso por los matones de todas las formas y tama\u00f1os, y su compasi\u00f3n por sus v\u00edctimas.\n\nHoy en d\u00eda, las \"caricaturas editoriales\" pueden recordar im\u00e1genes deliberadamente simplistas, del tipo que puede procesar en medio segundo mientras lee las noticias. Por el contrario, las caricaturas densas y meticulosamente etiquetadas de Nast eran noticias: no solo im\u00e1genes, sino argumentos, destinados a ser analizados y discutidos punto por punto.\n\nTomemos \"Third Term Panic\", la caricatura de 1874 a menudo se le atribuye la popularizaci\u00f3n del elefante como s\u00edmbolo del Partido Republicano. En los meses previos a las elecciones intermedias, el diario New York Herald, al tiempo que respaldaba a varios candidatos dem\u00f3cratas, hab\u00eda difundido el rumor de que el presidente Ulysses Grant, un republicano, evaluaba postular a un tercer mandato en 1876, no ilegal en los d\u00edas anteriores a la vig\u00e9simosegunda enmienda, pero definitivamente mal visto.\n\nNast, un orgulloso partidario republicano, dibuj\u00f3 al Herald como un burro envuelto en la piel de un le\u00f3n, asustando a los otros animales con historias salvajes de una dictadura de Grant. Entre estos animales se encuentra un enorme elefante, llamado \"El voto republicano\", que parece estar a punto de caer por un precipicio.\n\nAl igual que los mejores caricaturistas, Nast ridiculizaba a su propio bando casi tan alegremente como a sus oponentes, y as\u00ed, reimagin\u00f3 al Partido Republicano como una criatura d\u00e9bil y asustada que constantemente avanzaba pesadamente en la direcci\u00f3n equivocada, su tama\u00f1o era m\u00e1s una responsabilidad que un activo.\n\nA los asnos de Nast no les va mejor. Una caricatura t\u00edpica de 1879 muestra a la bestia obstinada que cuelga de la cola, a punto de caer en un abismo de \"caos financiero\". De hecho, la mayor\u00eda de las veces, sus caricaturas representan elefantes y burros al borde del caos, una evaluaci\u00f3n bastante justa de los l\u00edderes republicanos y dem\u00f3cratas durante la Edad Dorada.\n\nEs un poco extra\u00f1o que los dos partidos pol\u00edticos estadounidenses m\u00e1s importantes hayan abrazado a sus mascotas con tanto entusiasmo, teniendo en cuenta lo mal que se ven los dos animales en las caricaturas originales de Nast: lo est\u00fapidos, lo flexible, lo f\u00e1ciles de confundir. Tal vez ninguna de las partes se molest\u00f3 en revisar antes de abastecerse de productos con im\u00e1genes de los animales.\n\nO tal vez sab\u00edan sobre la burla de Nast y decidieron que la respuesta adecuada era unirse para burlarse de s\u00ed mismos.", "(CNN) Two common naloxone products, Narcan and Evzio, remain chemically stable after their expiration dates, according to new research.\n\nNaloxone, the generic name for the drug, is sometimes called a \"save shot\" or a \"rescue shot\" because of its ability to bring someone back from an opioid overdose. It has long been used in hospitals and by emergency medical technicians, but as the opioid addiction crisis sweeps the nation, it has become more widely available to people addicted to drugs and those around them.\n\nNarcan, a naloxone nasal spray, was found to be chemically stable for 10 months after its labeled expiration date. Evzio, a naloxone injection, was chemically stable for at least one year after its expiration date. The products tested were not kept in ideal storage conditions, the researchers say.\n\n\"The branded prescription products, the auto injectors and nasal spray, both of them still tested active. Every time we've tested them, they are still testing 100% active,\" said Charles Babcock , assistant clinical professor in the School of Pharmacy at Marshall University.\n\nBabcock said the results would be expected for naloxone stored in a controlled environment but not for products that had been stored by patients.\n\n\"Every one of them tested the same, which is what was impressive, especially considering the fact that we had actually dispensed these products to patients,\" said Babcock, principal investigator of the research, presented Tuesday at the PharmSci 360 Annual Meeting\n\n\"I dispense naloxone to patients all the time, and I had a couple come in after it had expired, and they had used it, and people were brought back to life.\"\n\nChris McCurdy , 2018 president of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists , said \"this research, in particular with naloxone, is obviously an important one for this day and time because of the opioid crisis that we are facing.\" McCurdy was not involved with the research.\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse credits naloxone administered by non-medical professionals as saving at least 26,500 people from drug overdoses between 1996 and 2014.\n\nResearch like this could lead to changes in the expiration dates of medications, said McCurdy, who is also a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. More research is needed for regulatory bodies \"so we can get meaningful expiration dates on to products that the people can really trust,\" he said.\n\n\"Showing that these drugs are actually stable beyond their expiration date indicates that we need to go back to the manufacturers and regulatory agencies and get adequate expiration dates on these products.\"\n\nHowever, he does not recommend that people take medication that has expired.\n\n\"We go by the expiration date, and we don't recommend people to take medications beyond their expiration date because, quite frankly, we don't know if it has decomposed or not,\" he said.\n\nResearch around drug expiration date testing is beneficial from a health care and an economic standpoint, according to Lee Cantrell, a professor of pharmacy and medicine at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new research. For some medications, extended expiration dates could increase their availability when needed.\n\n\"If there were studies that supported that medications remained viable for much longer and medications didn't need to be turned over so quickly and repurchased, that would be a huge cost savings to the health care system,\" said Cantrell, who is also director of the California Poison Control System, San Diego division\n\nResearch on drug expiration dates\n\nNaloxone isn't the only drug that's been found to retain its potency after its marketed expiration date.\n\n\"I just don't think we are where we need to be with respect to prescription drug date expiration dating within the United States,\" Cantrell said. \"This is just additional science that supports the fact that different types of medication maintain their potency for years to decades further out from their expiration dates.\"\n\nLast year , Cantrell found that epinephrine, the active ingredient in EpiPens, was still present up to 50 months after the stated expiration date.\n\nHis sample consisted of 40 expired EpiPens, nine of them EpiPen Jr; the medications are used to treat allergic emergencies. EpiPen Jr contains the correct dose of epinephrine for a patient weighing between 33 and 66 pounds.\n\nThe study found that 61% of the EpiPens and 56% of the EpiPen Jrs contained at least 90% of their stated amount of epinephrine.\n\n\"They were up to four years expired, and we analyzed them, and we found that they all had a residual dose in them that would be found therapeutic,\" he said.\n\nThis year, the FDA extended the expiration dates of certain lots of EpiPens by four months to help combat shortages of the products.\n\nCantrell's research has found that a number of active ingredients in prescription medication stayed potent after their labeled expiration date. Some of the tested drugs had expired as long as 40 years before.\n\n\"Acetaminophen, caffeine, codeine, those are ones that people would probably recognize,\" Cantrell said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAcetaminophen is present in many over-the-counter products to relieve pain and fever and to help treat coughs, colds, flu and sleeplessness. Codeine is used in some cough and cold medicines and as a pain reliever.\n\nOther ingredients that stayed potent after their expiration date included butalbital, methaqualone, phenacetin, meprobamate, pentobarbital, secobarbital, hydrocodone, homatropine and chlorpheniramine.\n\nAlthough expired medication may still work in some cases, patients are still advised not to take it. The medication might not be as strong as it needs to be to help.\n\n\"The best thing is not to take any medication that is past its expiration date and really consult a pharmacist to determine what you should do with that medication to properly dispose of it,\" said McCurdy, of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.", "New York (CNN Business) AMC Theatres will soon raise the price of its movie ticketing service in more than a dozen states.\n\nThe company announced this week that the cost of A-list \u2014 the MoviePass-like subscription program AMCintroduced this summer \u2014 will go up by $2 to $4 a month in 15 states and the District of Columbia on January 9. The price will remain unchanged at $20 a month in the rest of the country.\n\nA-List, which the company says is nearing 500,000 members, allows subscribers of the theater chain's loyalty program to see up to three movies per week at AMC locations.\n\nWhen it launched in June , the service was widely seen as the biggest threat to MoviePass, the popular subscription service that at the time offered members the ability to see one 2D movie a day for $10 a month. MoviePass has since pared down its program and lets its customers see three movies each month , though the selection of available movies varies.\n\nAMC ( AMC ) said the price hikes will affect states where its A-list program is the most popular. Members in Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and D.C. will all be charged $22 a month. Subscribers in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York will be charged $24.\n\nThe price change won't hit everyone at the same time. Current members and those who enroll before January 9 will be guaranteed the $20 price for 12 months from the start of their initial enrollment date. The program requires a minimum three-month commitment.\n\n\"As a reputable operator, AMC has no desire to whipsaw its guests with frequent change, nor would it do so without providing guests reasonable advance notice,\" the company added.\n\nThat appeared to be a jab at its biggest competitor, MoviePass, which made several changes to its program this summer and fall. The service's $10 price point exploded in popularity late last year, and MoviePass parent company Helios and Matheson ( HMNY ) has been burning through cash ever since.\n\nThree-million people subscribed to MoviePass as of this summer, but it's not clear if these recent problems have led to any changes in its user base. The company did not respond to CNN Business' request for an update on its subscriber count.", "\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0627\u0639\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0641\u0627\u0638 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0637 \u0647\u0627\u062f\u0626\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0628\u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0637\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0639 \u0623\u0633\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0645\u0639 \u0641\u0631\u0636 \u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0623\u0648 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627 \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627\u060c \u0625\u0630 \u064a\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062a\u0631\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0646 3 \u0625\u0644\u0649 4% \u0645\u0646 \u0625\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0625\u0645\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 06 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Aqu\u00ed hay una mirada en profundidad, hora por hora, sobre qu\u00e9 debes mirar y en d\u00f3nde\n\n(CNN) - Podr\u00eda tomar algunas horas, o unas pocas semanas, determinar qui\u00e9n gana el control del Congreso despu\u00e9s de las elecciones del martes.\n\n\n\nMIRA: D\u00eda de elecciones en EE.UU.: lo que debes saber minuto a minuto\n\nPero mientras los resultados llegan desde todo el pa\u00eds a partir de las 6 p.m. ET, veremos indicadores de si los dem\u00f3cratas lograr\u00e1n la ganancia neta de 23 esca\u00f1os que necesitan para controlar la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, si la mayor\u00eda del Senado de dos esca\u00f1os del Partido Republicano aumentar\u00e1 o disminuir\u00e1 y c\u00f3mo se alinear\u00e1n las elecciones de los gobernadores clave.\n\nTratamos de hacerlo lo m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil posible para realizar un seguimiento de todo.

Partes de ambos estados se encuentran en la zona horaria central, por lo que tomar\u00e1 tiempo ver si el senador dem\u00f3crata de Indiana Joe Donnelly sobrevive a un desaf\u00edo del empresario republicano Mike Braun.\n\nDe la que todos hablaremos primero: el distrito 6 de Kentucky. Amy McGrath, expiloto de combate, est\u00e1 desafiando al representante republicano Andy Barr.\n\nPuede que no sea un gran referente nacional. En un giro inusual, en parte debido a los anuncios brutales que Barr ha emitido, la carrera se ha convertido en gran parte sobre McGrath y en si es demasiado progresista para el distrito, en lugar de un refer\u00e9ndum sobre Trump o el congresista titular. Pero ser\u00e1 un indicador temprano del ambiente, y una p\u00e9rdida de Barr dar\u00eda a los republicanos razones para entrar en p\u00e1nico.\n\nMcGrath podr\u00eda alzarse con una ventaja temprano ya que los resultados de la ciudad de Lexington son los primeros, pero es probable que el margen se incremente r\u00e1pidamente.\n\nMIRA: 8 grandes preguntas para el d\u00eda de elecciones\n\nLos indicadores tempranos (7-7: 30 p.m. ET)\n\n\u00bfUna ola creciente?\n\nVirginia podr\u00eda ser una se\u00f1al temprana importante de hacia d\u00f3nde se dirige la C\u00e1mara. Los dem\u00f3cratas deben ganar all\u00ed en el Distrito 10, donde los estrategas de ambos partidos dicen que es poco probable que la representante republicana Barbara Comstock se mantenga en su asiento en los suburbios de Washington DC. Sin embargo, la carrera del representante republicano Scott Taylor en el distrito 2 de Norfolk es mucho mejor para ambiente nacional. Y si el representante del Partido Republicano, Dave Brat, pierde en el 7\u00ba Distrito fuera de Richmond, o incluso si est\u00e1 en una carrera dif\u00edcil, podr\u00eda ser una se\u00f1al de una ola dem\u00f3crata creciente.\n\nLos dem\u00f3cratas vieron a un distrito m\u00e1s en Virginia emerger como competitivo al final del ciclo: el 5to Distrito, donde la experiodista Leslie Cockburn se enfrenta al republicano Denver Riggleman, un veterano de la Fuerza A\u00e9rea y propietario de una destiler\u00eda. Una victoria dem\u00f3crata aqu\u00ed ser\u00eda una se\u00f1al de una marejada que amenaza con acabar con los republicanos que ni siquiera estaban en el radar nacional.\n\nLos suburbios de Atlanta cuentan con dos distritos de creadores de olas: si los dem\u00f3cratas ganan cualquiera de los dos, eso significar\u00eda que tendr\u00e1n una gran noche. En el distrito 6 de Georgia, la representante republicana Karen Handel, quien gan\u00f3 una elecci\u00f3n especial contra Jon Ossoff el a\u00f1o pasado, se enfrenta a Lucy McBath, una retadora cuyo hijo desarmado fue asesinado a tiros en una disputa sobre m\u00fasica a todo volumen. Y en el s\u00e9ptimo distrito, los republicanos est\u00e1n furiosos porque el representante Rob Woodall nunca tom\u00f3 en serio su carrera.\n\nTambi\u00e9n mant\u00e9n tus ojos en algunos creadores de olas en Florida. El 15\u00ba Distrito del \u00e1rea de Tampa es un asiento abierto que emergi\u00f3 como competitivo tarde, tan tarde, de hecho, que los republicanos no pudieron costear un rescate. En el lado de la costa atl\u00e1ntica, el concurso de asientos abiertos del 6to. Distrito para el antiguo asiento del exrepresentante Ron DeSantis es otro potencial asalto dem\u00f3crata que sugiere que el partido estar\u00eda superando los 23 esca\u00f1os que necesita para la mayor\u00eda de la C\u00e1mara. Si cualquiera de los representantes republicanos, Brian Mast o Vern Buchanan pierde, es otra se\u00f1al de que los dem\u00f3cratas est\u00e1n en el camino de ganar la C\u00e1mara.\n\nMIRA: Las 10 contiendas claves para los latinos en las elecciones intermedias\n\nLos que hacen historia\n\nEn Georgia, la protagonista es la carrera del gobernador entre el secretario de Estado republicano Brian Kemp y Stacey Abrams, una estrella dem\u00f3crata emergente que ha combinado una plataforma progresiva con un llamamiento a los votantes negros, y con la posibilidad de convertirse en la primera gobernadora negra del pa\u00eds. Si ninguno de los candidatos supera el 50%, la carrera se dirigir\u00e1 a una segunda vuelta.\n\nEn Florida, una peque\u00f1a parte est\u00e1 en horario central, por lo que tendremos que esperar una hora adicional para que lleguen los resultados completos de la carrera del gobernador entre el alcalde dem\u00f3crata de Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, un favorito progresivo, y DeSantis, quien tiene se aline\u00f3 tan estrechamente con Trump que esta es una vista previa potencial de 2020.\n\nLa hora decisiva (8 p.m. ET)\n\nSi a\u00fan no has sintonizado, este es el momento.\n\nEl control del Senado est\u00e1 en juego\n\nLa mayor\u00eda del Senado podr\u00eda reducirse a dos carreras clave en los estados donde las \u00faltimas urnas se cierran a las 8 p.m. ET\n\nTennessee es una de las mejores oportunidades para los dem\u00f3cratas en el mapa. El exgobernador dem\u00f3crata Phil Bredesen se ha comprometido en repetidas ocasiones a trabajar con Trump en un intento de cortejar a los republicanos moderados y alejarlos de la representante republicana Marsha Blackburn.\n\nY Missouri, donde la senadora dem\u00f3crata Claire McCaskill se enfrenta al fiscal general republicano del estado, Josh Hawley, es una de las mejores oportunidades del Partido Republicano (junto con Dakota del Norte e Indiana).\n\nLa hora m\u00e1s crucial para el control de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes\n\nEsta tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda ser la hora en que la pr\u00f3xima C\u00e1mara comience a tomar forma. Los dos campos de batalla principales son Pensilvania y Nueva Jersey.\n\nEn Pensilvania los dem\u00f3cratas probablemente obtendr\u00e1n cuatro esca\u00f1os.\n\nEn Nueva Jersey, los dem\u00f3cratas deben ganar al menos dos carreras con dos de sus mejores reclutas del ciclo: el 2\u00ba Distrito abierto, donde el senador del estado dem\u00f3crata conservador Jeff Van Drew es el gran favorito, y el Distrito 11, con Mikie Sherrill.\n\nPero son estos dos candidatos los que claramente mostrar\u00edan a los dem\u00f3cratas en su camino hacia una gran mayor\u00eda en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes: los titulares republicanos Leonard Lance y Tom MacArthur, uno de los arquitectos del proyecto de ley de revocaci\u00f3n de la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica de la C\u00e1mara que tambi\u00e9n respald\u00f3 la ley de impuestos de Trump, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 en la pelea de su vida pol\u00edtica. Si MacArthur pierde, mostrar\u00eda cu\u00e1n potente es la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica como un problema para los dem\u00f3cratas.\n\nLos que hacen la mayor\u00eda (9 p.m. ET)\n\n\u00bfRevuelta suburbana? Un mont\u00f3n de asientos de la C\u00e1mara est\u00e1n en juego a las 9 p.m. en los cierres de las urnas y, dependiendo de la manera en que los estados comiencen en la inclinaci\u00f3n de la noche, una mayor\u00eda dem\u00f3crata de la Casa podr\u00eda unirse a medida que se cierran las urnas en Colorado, Texas, Minnesota y una docena de estados m\u00e1s.\n\nPero la noche podr\u00eda convertirse en una noche verdaderamente excepcional para los dem\u00f3cratas con victorias en distritos de color rojo profundo sin centros de poblaci\u00f3n considerables que Trump gan\u00f3 hace dos a\u00f1os. Dos buenos ejemplos de eso vienen en el norte del estado de Nueva York, donde los dem\u00f3cratas Antonio Delgado y Anthony Brindisi est\u00e1n desafiando a los titulares republicanos, y en Kansas City donde Paul Davis est\u00e1 buscando derrotar al republicano Steve Watkins.\n\n\u00bfSe har\u00e1 historia en Texas?\n\nTexas no ha elegido a un dem\u00f3crata a nivel estatal desde 1988. Pero el representante Beto O'Rourke, impulsado por el entusiasmo dem\u00f3crata y el dinero de un cami\u00f3n de Brinks, le ha dado al senador Ted Cruz una verdadera carrera.

Monday night in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, rallying support for Republican Josh Hawley's challenge to Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Trump was joined by luminaries within the conservative movement like Rush Limbaugh, Jeannine Pirro and Sean Hannity, as the President desperately tried to keep Republicans in control of the Senate with the prospect of the GOP holding the House majority slipping further and further away.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nThe speech was vintage Trump in every way -- good and bad. Below the 31 most, uh, notable lines from Trump's last word on Campaign 2018.\n\n1. \"There's nobody like him. There never has been anybody like him.\"\n\nDonald Trump on Rush Limbaugh. And away we go!\n\n2. \"And we don't mean at all to insult -- look at the size of the media back there. That's a lot of people.\"\n\nAlways, always, always aware of the media and how many are covering him. He cares -- deeply -- about the media and what the media thinks of him. Always has.\n\n3. \"She has got viewership like you wouldn't believe, and she speaks from the heart. Her opening monologue is always exciting.\"\n\nThis is Trump introducing Pirro and proves how aware he is of ratings and how much TV he watches. A lot and a lot.\n\n4. \"I'm not on the ticket, although they want to put me on the ticket.\"\n\nIs the \"they\" here Democrats? Or Republicans? Neither? Both?\n\n5. \"Does that look like the Academy Awards back there? Look how many people there are. Look how many, the Academy Awards. That's the Academy Awards.\"\n\nSize. Bigness. Always.\n\n6. \"Somebody said it's not humanly possible. I said, I guess it is.\"\n\nWhat is he talking about? The size of his crowds, of course! Many people said there aren't enough people in the universe for these crowd sizes. I said we'll find them on other planets then. Believe me.\n\n7. \"Nah, don't worry. I'm smart, also. And we're smart. Hey, you know, while I'm at it, don't you love it when they talk about the elites, right?\"\n\nDonald Trump is introducing his daughter, Ivanka, here. But somehow he feels the need to mention that he is smart. [shakes head in amazement]\n\n8. \"The elites. Well, I know all the elites. They're not very smart in many cases. They have a lot of hatred in their heart.\"\n\nThis message is the core of Trump's appeal to voters. That he, despite being a billionaire who lives in New York City, is like them -- a target of liberal elites (media, Democrats, colleges and universities, etc.) who think they know better and can impose their values on the average Joe. And Trump is on to them, he suggests -- he's got it all figured out and he's exposing them.\n\n9. \"I don't know about you, but many of you went to better schools than they did. We did better in the schools than they did. We have better houses, homes, boats. We do better than they do. We work harder than they do. We make more money than they do. Why are they called the elites?\"\n\nEverything in life is a zero-sum game, a competition in which someone wins and someone loses. EVERYTHING.\n\n10. \"But let's let them be called the elites, because you, we are the super elites. We are the super elites.\"\n\n\"Super Elites\" is the name of my fantasy football team.\n\n11. \"And a very nice guy named John King for CNN, you know, he has the board, the red board, and his hand is like starting to shake because that board had so much red on it, they've never seen anything like it.\"\n\n[narrator voice] This never happened. [2nd narrator voice] But you already knew that.\n\n12. \"But then out of the blue, out of the blue, they said, oh, oh, oh, you know, there were some crying, you know? These people are very fair. They're crying, OK?\"\n\nThere's very, very, very little evidence that reporters were crying when Trump won. The example always cited by conservative critics of the media is that New York Times Hillary Clinton correspondent Amy Chozick admitted to crying the day after the election when she wrote the \"How She Lost\" story on the former first lady. But there's zero evidence that Chozick was crying because Clinton lost. Rather, I took her description of her crying in her memoir as a sort of venting and catharsis for the last two years and everything she had endured in her life.

This woman was never someone who got media attention. This was not Christine Blasey Ford. But you wouldn't know that listening to Trump here.\n\n22. \" False statements. A made-up story.\"\n\nAgain, this is one woman who has recanted her allegations against Kavanaugh. The idea that this woman somehow invalidates entirely the allegations made by Ford and other women is nonsensical.\n\n23. \"False accusations. False accusations. They want to ruin a man or a woman. Ruin a man. And it was headed up all by the Democrats, all by the Democrats, right?\"\n\nFord testified, under oath, that she was never contacted or encouraged by Democrats to come forward.\n\n24. \"Our great, great, brave, brave soldier from Vietnam, except he never saw Vietnam. Da Nang Dick, you know, Da Nang. He's from Da Nang.\"\n\n25. \"Remember they used to say there is no way for Donald Trump to get 270. And they were right.

We have to do what's right.\"\n\nThis is a message that could resonate with lots of people -- not just Republicans. But because of all the immigration rhetoric under the bridge by Trump, it won't.\n\n27. \"As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws and violate our borders.\"\n\nEr, no.\n\n28. \"And we're doing very well.

The number has risen from 18 cases, including six deaths, announced last month by the health department.\n\nA staff member was also affected by the outbreak but has recovered.\n\nThe outbreak in the Wanaque facility was caused by adenovirus type 7. This type is \"most commonly associated with acute respiratory disease,\" according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other types of adenovirus infections can cause flu-like symptoms, pinkeye and diarrhea.\n\nThe health department also announced Monday that a new case of adenovirus was found among kids at a second New Jersey facility, Voorhees Pediatric Facility -- bringing their total to five. However, CDC tests suggest that the culprit is adenovirus type 3, a different strain than the one in Wanaque.\n\nPatients at the Voorhees facility became ill between October 20 and 29. An inspection by the state health department last week found no infection control problems and issued no citations.\n\n\"The Department and local health partners have been working with the facility to provide infection control recommendations and identify other possible illnesses since the [Voorhees] facility notified the Department of a case of adenovirus in a resident on October 26,\" New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal said in a statement Monday.\n\nHealth officials say they are stepping up efforts to strengthen infection control at such facilities in the state. The health department announced plans last week to deploy a team of infection control experts to visit University Hospital and four pediatric long-term care facilities this month, including the Wanaque and Voorhees facilities, where experts will train staff and evaluate how these facilities prevent and control infections.\n\n\"Facility outbreaks are not always preventable, but in response to what we have seen in Wanaque, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the chance they occur among the most vulnerable patients in New Jersey,\" Elnahal said in a statement last week.\n\nAdenoviruses are often spread by touching a contaminated person or surface, or through the air by coughing or sneezing. They are known to persist on unclean surfaces and medical instruments for long periods of time, and they may not be eliminated by common disinfectants, but they rarely cause severe illness in healthy people. However, people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk for severe disease, and they may remain contagious long after they recover, according to the CDC.\n\nSymptoms may appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus, the state health department said.\n\nThe infections and deaths come amid questions -- from former Wanaque Center employees , the mother of one of the children who died, and Elnahal himself -- about whether current facility standards are high enough and whether more could have been done to prevent this from happening.\n\nElnahal previously said in a statement that the findings of a recent unannounced health inspection at the Wanaque facility \"raise questions about whether these general longterm care standards are optimal for this vulnerable population of medically fragile children.\"\n\n\"We also need to think about whether there is more we can do as healthcare leaders to protect immunocompromised children, such as those served at Wanaque Center,\" he said. \"Every year in the state, there are hundreds of outbreaks at healthcare facilities.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn statements last month, the Wanaque facility said that it's working alongside health experts to investigate the outbreak and that it \"promptly notified all appropriate government agencies when the virus was initially identified.\" According to state health department spokeswoman Nicole Kirgan, health officials were notified of respiratory illness at the facility on October 9, and the facility notified parents 10 days later, on October 19.\n\nThe facility has not responded to CNN's calls and emails for further comment.\n\nThe facility has been \"instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends and they are in full compliance,\" according to the state health department. State health officials have said the outbreak can only be declared over when four weeks pass without an additional case.\n\n\"It can be difficult to impossible to know how the virus got to the facility, what its source was, or what its specific mechanism of spread is from person to person,\" Elnahal said.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEn Asia, Corea del Sur tiene la tasa de suicidios m\u00e1s alta que Jap\u00f3n con 26,9 muertes por cada 100.000 habitantes vs. 18,5 del pa\u00eds nip\u00f3n\n\nAunque el suicidio entre ni\u00f1os y adolescentes aument\u00f3, el total de suicidios en Jap\u00f3n cay\u00f3 a 21.321 en 2017 de un m\u00e1ximo de 34.427 en 2003\n\nEn el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o 250 ni\u00f1os de primaria y secundaria de Jap\u00f3n se suicidaron en el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o\n\nTokio (CNN) - M\u00e1s ni\u00f1os y adolescentes japoneses se han suicidado entre 2016 y 2017 que en cualquier a\u00f1o desde 1986, seg\u00fan un nuevo reporte del gobierno.\n\nEl m\u00e1s reciente informe muestra que 250 ni\u00f1os de primaria y secundaria acabaron con sus vidas en el a\u00f1o por una cantidad variada de razones, incluyendo matoneo, problemas familiares y estr\u00e9s, dijo el Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n este lunes, seg\u00fan los medios locales.\n\nEsas cifras son 5 veces m\u00e1s que el a\u00f1o anterior, y las m\u00e1s altas desde 1986, cuando 268 alumnos murieron.\n\n\u201cEl n\u00famero de suicidios de estudiantes se mantuvo alto, y este es un tema alarmante que debe ser abordado\u201d, dijo el ministro Noriaki Kitazaki a los reporteros. \u00c9l dijo que la causa del aumento de los suicidios no estaba clara.\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os que se suicidaron eran estudiantes de secundaria.

Here are some of them:\n\n\u2022 Alabama: Two polling locations in Montgomery County -- Southlawn Elementary School and Wares Ferry Road Elementary School -- were remain open an extra hour after getting a late start Tuesday, a state circuit judge ruled.\n\nThe polling places at Southlawn Elementary School and Wares Ferry Road Elementary School would remain open until 8 p.m. local, according to the court order.\n\nThe two locations were \"unable to process votes\" at their 7 a.m. local opening time \"due to improper ballots being delivered,\" according to a petition filed by a county probate judge.\n\n\u2022 Georgia: In Fulton County, a judge ordered three Atlanta polling places to stay open late: The Pittman Park Recreation Center (9 p.m. ET), and the Archer Hall and Booker T. Washington precincts on the campus of Morehouse College (10 p.m.).\n\nThe Pittman Park site had too few voting machines to start the day Tuesday, an official said, resulting in long lines that drew the attention of the Rev. Jesse Jackson.\n\nOnly three voting machines were initially delivered there, resulting in long lines, Fulton County spokesperson April Majors said. Five more machines were eventually delivered.\n\nJackson, who already was in town, said he visited the site and met people who had waited most of the morning to vote. He said he encouraged people not to leave.\n\n\"It's inhumane,\" he told CNN about those people having to wait all morning to vote. \"I'm worried because people are on dialysis or have to go to work.\"\n\nIn Gwinnett County, just northeast of Atlanta, a polling place at Annistown Elementary School opened late, in part because machines used to check voters in had technical issues, said Candice Broce, spokeswoman for the Georgia Secretary of State's Office.\n\nAs a result, the polls were to stay open at that school until 9:25 p.m. Two other precincts in the county also would be open later: Anderson-Livsey Precinct (7:30 p.m.) and Harbins Precinct (7:14 p.m.), Broce said.\n\nFannin County's Sugar Creek polling station also was set to stay open nine minutes longer, until 7:09 p.m., Broce said\n\n\u2022 Illinois: In Chicago, four precincts were to remain open one hour later (Precinct 20 of Ward 9; Precinct 31 of Ward 9; Precinct 35 of Ward 2; Precinct 22 of Ward 20) and another (Precinct 22 of Ward 20) was to stay open two hours later.\n\nJim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago election board, told CNN these polling sites opened late, upward of 100 voters were turned away, and no one logged their names. These votes, he said, are sequestered because they voted on provisional ballots.\n\n\u2022 Indiana: A state judge approved a request from the Porter County Democratic Central Committee to extend voting hours at 12 precincts in the northwestern Indiana county on Tuesday night.\n\nPolls in Indiana typically close at 6 p.m. local time. But the judge's ruling added between an hour and two-and-a-half hours to precincts in Valparaiso, Chesterton, Portage and Crown Point.\n\nThe request was made because the precincts opened late, The Times of Northwest Indiana reported.\n\nVoting hours also were extended in Monroe County until 7 p.m. ET due to a backup of voter lines, according to Larime Wilson, a county election official. Ballots were still being delivered to precincts, and while machine voting was an option, it was slower than voting on a paper ballot.\n\nBecause of this inconvenience, an election judge ruled to extend the hours, Wilson said.\n\nVoters who were line at 6 p.m. ET would vote regularly, and anyone who voted after 6 p.m. would vote via a provisional ballot, Wilson said.\n\n\u2022 Maine: In Portland, voting at the Italian Heritage Center polling location was extended until 9:30 p.m. because a car accident had blocked the location's entrance, the Secretary of State's office said.\n\n\u2022 North Carolina: Voting in one precinct in Columbus County will be extended until 9:20 p.m. ET. The state Board of Elections decided in an emergency meeting to the extension because voting was disrupted for nearly two hours in the morning when one style of ballot was unavailable. Polling times were also extended in one precinct in Gaston County by 20 minutes, the board said.\n\n\u2022 Texas: In Harris County, nine polling sites, mostly in Houston, were set to remain open until 8 p.m. CT, according to a local elections official and the Texas Civil Rights Project, which sought a temporary restraining order.\n\n\u2022 Virginia: By court order, precincts 316 and 317 in Chesterfield County were to remain open for voters until 9 p.m.\n\nSite at North Dakota reservation running out of ballots\n\nAt least one voting site on North Dakota's Pine Ridge reservation was running low on ballots late Tuesday afternoon, and may run out soon, an inspector at the site said.\n\nThe voting location was set to stay open to 7 p.m. local time, but officials are not certain ballots would be there the entire time.\n\nCNN spoke to an official inspector, Annette Red Tomahawk, at the Standing Rock reservation's Porcupine voting precinct. It is just one of many on reservation, and there are about half dozen different tribes/reservations in North Dakota.\n\nThe site initially had around 50 to 60 ballots, she said. She did not have an accurate count, because some of her ballots were taken to another location that also was running out.\n\nTomahawk said her site had only about 10 left. A line was forming -- and she was expecting a \"rush\" after work.\n\nCNN is reaching out to other officials about these issues.\n\nHumidity in North Carolina\n\nThe North Carolina state board of elections said humidity appeared to be causing difficulties in feeding ballots through tabulators in some Wake County precincts.\n\nIn a news release, North Carolina's Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement said such ballots will be stored in \"emergency bins\" and \"will be tabulated as soon as possible.\" All ballots will be counted, the board said.\n\nOfficials were working to resolve the issue in eight of the 204 precincts of Wake County N.C., Dara Demi, the county communications director, told CNN. The county sent crews out to affected locations to help bring the humidity under control.\n\n\"The tabulators are not broken, but extremely sensitive.\" Demi said, \"This is by design.\" Over the course of the day, voting officials will feed ballots from the emergency bins back into voting machines until they are accepted.\n\nBallot shortage in Arlington, Texas\n\nAn Arlington, Texas, voting location didn't have enough paper ballots for an entire precinct.\n\nKhadija Farah told CNN that 20 minutes after she arrived at her polling place at T.A. Howard Middle School in Tarrant County, the line to vote stretched out the door. Farah says that the electronic voting machine was not working, and she was told by a poll worker that they did not have any ballots for her precinct.\n\n\"Once that info was shared, most of the people in line decided to leave,\" she says.\n\nSam Taylor, communications director for the Texas Secretary of State's office, told CNN that the location immediately made emergency ballots available so that voters could continue to cast their ballots.\n\nScanner issues in New York\n\nAmy Spitalnick, New York attorney general's communications director, said the top complaint on their Election Day hotline was broken scanners.\n\nIn a tweet, Spitalnick said they had received 225 calls and emails as of noon, and that 40-plus complaints were about poll sites that had at least one scanner broken, if not all.\n\nAbout 225 calls & emails to the AG's #ElectionDay Hotline so far. Not surprisingly, the #1 complaint is broken scanners; 40+ complaints re: poll sites w/ at least 1 scanner broken (if not all). As always, we're troubleshooting individual issues & looking into systemic problems. https://t.co/G95FQidF7b \u2014 Amy Spitalnick (@amyspitalnick) November 6, 2018\n\nPoll workers in New York are warning voters to not get their paper ballots wet, according to a state official.\n\nLocal officials have told their state counterparts that \"keeping the ballots dry is paramount,\" state Board of Elections spokeswoman Cheryl Couser told CNN when asked about reports of ballot scanner problems in multiple city locations.\n\n\"Poll workers have been advising voters to keep wet jackets/umbrellas away from the ballot,\" Couser said.\n\nIn New York City, voters mark a paper ballot, which is then torn along a perforated line and fed into scanners as two pages, according to the city Board of Elections.\n\nCouser said local authorities are deploying technicians in response to voting machine issues but \"are not experiencing a high level of machine issues.\" The city is \"experiencing a higher turnout than normal,\" she said.\n\nThe city's Board of Elections spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNN's inquiries.\n\nPower outages in Tennessee\n\nA polling place at Cedar Bluff Middle School in Knoxville, Tennessee, did not have power Tuesday morning and the site's backup generator also failed.\n\nCliff Rodgers, administrator for elections for Knox County, told CNN that people on site are urgently working to get the power on, and voting is still ongoing.\n\n\"We're voting with paper ballots,\" he told CNN by phone.\n\nBecause there was no ambient light in the building, they were voting outside. Out of an abundance of caution, Rodgers said, he ordered more paper ballots to the polling place.\n\nCitizens in Knox County, Tennessee voted despite a power outage at a polling station.\n\nMedical emergency in Pennsylvania\n\nAmie Downs, a spokesperson for Allegheny County, said an individual who was due to open a polling site at a Carnegie Library location in the Pittsburgh area suffered a medical emergency.\n\nThe individual was hospitalized and voters requested emergency ballots. The ballots were sent to the location, which will be up and running shortly, Downs said.\n\nCalibration issues in South Carolina\n\nRokey Suleman, the elections director in Richland County, South Carolina, told CNN that they were seeing a \"higher frequency\" of calibration issues for voting machines that are around 14 years old.\n\nThe issue means that a voter would touch a machine's screen to choose a candidate and end up choosing the wrong one, although presumably voters can review which candidates they have picked and correct their choices.\n\nSuleman estimated about 50 of the almost 1,000 machines in the county have had problems. He said he believes the machines that are having problems have gotten worse partly because of their age and also because of issues that arise from how they are delivered to voting sites.\n\n\"The calibration screens can be sensitive,\" Suleman said. \"The machines are not delivered with the greatest of care. They're delivered -- not thrown around, but they're not delivered on a pillow either. But the older the machines are, the more likely you are to see screen calibration issues.\"\n\nThirty technicians were out in the field \"recalibrating\" the machines that are reported to have issues, he said.\n\nIsland's lone voting machine fails, so a replacement is ferried\n\nWhen the lone voting machine on a remote island failed, Rhode Island officials delivered a replacement machine -- by ferry.\n\nThe ballot scanning machine at the Prudence Island polling site stopped accepting ballots Tuesday morning, according to Miguel Nunez, the state's deputy director of elections.\n\nVoting continued without disruption using a backup procedure, he told CNN. Voters mark paper ballots, which are then counted by a scanner.\n\nA new machine was delivered about an hour later after the problem was reported.\n\nThe island has 176 registered voters, Nunez said, and 218 residents, according to the 2010 census.\n\nThe Prudence Island voting site is one of two in the state that is only accessible by ferry. Block Island is another isolated site, but has two voting machines.\n\nNunez said he does not recall a similar incident in his 20 years with the state Elections Board.\n\nDHS: Reports of voting machine issues are 'typical'\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials say they are aware of various reports from the states on voting machine issues but do not believe they are out of the norm.\n\n\"They did not share any widespread issues or trends with specific machines,\" a department official who has been coordinating with election machine vendors told reporters Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThere are \"typical machine issues,\" he said.\n\nFederal officials also said they are aware of voting misinformation that has been spread, but not aware of any \"that we can attribute to a foreign actor.\"\n\nA DHS official told reporters Tuesday afternoon that there is some \"intentional misinformation\" that has spread.\n\nThat has \"been rapidly addressed by the platforms,\" the official said in an apparent reference to social media, or by law enforcement, which is \"engaging with the folks who are sending those out.\"\n\nOther misinformation appears to be accidental, the official said, such as text messages sent this morning telling voters to cast their ballots Wednesday.\n\nDHS is also monitoring how weather has affected the voting process in some localities, including by causing power outages.\n\nThe department has a national operations center and an online forum to communicate with state officials.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

where they say 79 schoolchildren were abducted.\n\nThe restrictions began Tuesday in some districts in Bamenda to facilitate search and rescue operations for the abducted children, according to local authorities.\n\nThe pupils were taken around midnight Monday along with their teacher, the principal and a driver , from their boarding school, the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda city, authorities told CNN.\n\nMonday, the army deployed military police and helicopters to search for the children.\n\nThough no one has claimed responsibility for the abductions, authorities did not rule out the involvement of secessionists fighters, who are waging war in Cameroon's English-speaking provinces.\n\nSeveral separatist groups have denied involvement in the kidnapping.\n\nAmbazonia Defense Forces spokesman Tapang Ivo Tanku, in a statement posted on Facebook , alleged that government forces took the students.\n\nHe described the kidnapping as a \"mass distraction tactic\" by President Paul Biya's government to divert international and local attention from the President's inauguration.\n\nHe said members of the separatist group had been ordered to search communities in the region to uncover the kidnappers' hideout.\n\nCNN is unable to immediately reach the government for comments on Tanku's allegations.\n\nBiya, who has ruled the West African nation for 36 years, was sworn in Tuesday for a seventh term\n\nHe called for peace in the country's troubled Anglophone regions during his inauguration in the country's parliament.\n\nKidnapping incidents have increased this year in Cameroon's volatile Anglophone regions by armed separatist groups calling for a secession of those areas, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSeven students and a head teacher were kidnapped in September by armed separatists from their school in the town of Bafut, in the northwest of the country, according to Amnesty International.\n\nThe hostages were \"tortured and seriously injured\" by their kidnappers before their release, the human rights group said.\n\nOn Tuesday, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for the UN Secretary General, condemned the reported kidnapping and called for the children's immediate release and return.\n\n\"There can be no justification for these crimes against civilians, particularly minors,\" Dujarric said, adding that the United Nations was ready to assist with \"an inclusive dialogue process\" for a peaceful solution to the crisis in the country's northwest and southwest regions.\n\nStrong grip\n\nBiya's seventh term came despite mounting allegations of human rights abuses and an escalating secessionist movement threatening the nation's stability.\n\nAmnesty International said in a September report that it had recorded 260 security incidents this year, including the kidnappings of civilians and violence between Cameroon's soldiers and armed Anglophone separatists.\n\nRights groups have accused the 85-year-old leader of presiding over a brutal regime, marred by human rights abuses, particularly toward residents and armed separatists in Cameroon's English-speaking provinces.\n\nArmed separatists also face allegations of killing and kidnapping civilians and soldiers.\n\nAnglophone crisis\n\nVolatility in Cameroon's Anglophone provinces is nothing new.\n\nCameroonians in the northwest and southwest provinces make up about 20% of the country's population, but they say that the mostly French-speaking government has marginalized them.\n\nThe Anglophone problem, as it is sometimes called, is a legacy of West Africa's colonial past. Germany claimed the region prior to World War I, but after losing the war the territories were split and \"given\" to the English and French governments.\n\nThe nation that become Cameroon was an awkward amalgamation of those two colonies.\n\nThe current unrest escalated in late 2016 after lawyers, teachers and students went on strike and held street demonstrations about what they said was continued discrimination against Anglophones.\n\nThe strikes and boycotts led to a severe crackdown by police and soldiers, say groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. These groups and local activists say that scores of villages have been burned and civilians killed by the government actions.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch said the kidnapping \"may only be the tip of the iceberg.\" The group called on international actors to \"unanimously condemn violence against civilians\" and to \"ensure that this horrific event doesn't become a justification for further abuses by any of the parties to this crisis.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Protests in Cameroon turn deadly Replay More Videos ...

Not so fast: Genetics has only a small impact on longevity, a new study involving more than 400 million people suggests. Longevity is mostly decided by lifestyle, with less than 10% down to DNA, according to the study , published Tuesday in the journal Genetics.\n\n\"We know that people who research their families are very interested in the topic of longevity,\" said Cathy Ball, a co-author of the study and chief scientific officer at Ancestry, a consumer genetics company that provides an online family history resource.\n\nHow much do our genes contribute to our life span?\n\nGenetic differences explain just 15% to 30% of longevity, previous studies suggest, and it's the non-genetic differences between us -- such as how we eat and whether we have a fatal accident -- that explain why one person had a longer life than another.\n\nScientists from Calico Life Sciences LLC , a Google-funded company focused on the biology of aging, teamed up with researchers from Ancestry to investigate the genetic influence on life span. They analyzed anonymous family tree structures -- or \"pedigrees\" -- that included year of birth, year of death, place of birth and family connections for 439,361,203 people. These public family trees or pedigrees had been generated by subscribers of Ancestry.\n\nThe large size and scope of the database allowed the Calico scientists \"to look across families over generations, analyzing longevity not just in family members, but importantly among in-laws as well,\" Ball wrote in an email.\n\nWith mathematical and statistical calculations, the team found that for siblings and first cousins, longevity heritability -- or how much of the variation in people's life spans can be attributed to genetic variations -- was about the same as previous studies indicated. Specifically, genes explained between 20% and 30% of longevity, with this estimate dropping below 15% for family relations of the opposite gender.\n\nThe researchers also found the life span of spouses to be similar -- more so than siblings of opposite gender. A possible explanation: Spouses live in the same household and therefore share important non-genetic factors, such as diet and general lifestyle.\n\nYet the study results also showed that siblings-in-law and first-cousins-in-law had similar life spans despite not being blood relatives and not sharing a living space.\n\nWhat would account for this finding? The authors believe a likely explanation is \"assortative mating.\"\n\n\"Assortative mating is a mating pattern in which individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern,\" J. Graham Ruby , lead author of the study and a scientist and principal investigator at Calico, wrote in an email.\n\nObviously, no one knows when they or a potential partner will die, so in this case, assortative mating would be based on secondary traits. For example, income is known to influence life span, as eating well and taking care of your health are both somewhat tied to money. If people from families of equal income tend to marry one another, this would explain similar longevity across non-family relations, the study suggests.\n\nFactoring mating choice into their calculations, the researchers estimated that heritability actually explains no more than 7% of longevity, possibly even less.\n\nYour genes alone cannot save you from an early death.\n\nGenetic contributions to longevity\n\nThe new research adds to the existing \"clues about what drives aging,\" said David Melzer, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Exeter Medical School in the UK and a professor in the Center on Aging at the University of Connecticut Health Center in the US.\n\nMelzer, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email that \"it would have been nice to see\" the estimates for heritability in cases of exceptional longevity, because centenarians are believed to have a higher degree of heritability for longevity than others.\n\nMelzer and Luke C.

This is \"significantly higher\" than the 7% or lower suggested by the new family tree study, he said.\n\nHe noted that more than 20 genes have been identified for longevity.\n\n\"These include genes that interact with health behaviors, such as the nicotine receptor gene,\" Melzer said. He and his colleagues also found genes that influence cell senescence or the deterioration of individual cells. \"It is likely that there are many such gene variants involved in lifespan and aging,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Ball said, \"although there is a genetic component, this study shows that there is a major impact from many other forces in your life.\"\n\nThe results suggest that anyone wishing for a long life would do better to eat right and exercise, rather than rely on Grandpa's good genes.", "(CNN) A 21-year-old driver struggled with his passenger over the steering wheel before driving his truck into a group of Girl Scouts, killing three and one of their mothers, prosecutors in Wisconsin said.\n\nThe passenger told authorities he tried to correct the vehicle Saturday when he noticed Colten Treu crossing the center line near Lake Hallie, Chippewa County District Attorney Wade Newell said Monday.\n\nColten Treu\n\nTreu was \"somewhat out of it,\" the passenger said, and grabbed the wheel back, drove off the roadway and struck the group, Newell said.\n\nA fourth girl, 10, was injured as the group was participating in a highway cleanup project.

It's in a very pure environment, very moving and inspirational, and it's an opportunity for those individuals who had not experienced her in a gospel context to see how diverse her music is. We are so excited to be a part of this.\"\n\nThe documentary was mostly shot by famed director Sydney Pollack and captures Franklin's gospel performances over a two-day period at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles in 1972.\n\nThe music was released as a double live album, but the film was held because Pollack failed to sync the sound, which made it difficult to edit.\n\nElliott acquired the rights to the film from Pollack in 2007, and Pollack died the following year.\n\nIn 2011 Franklin sued to stop the film's release and argued she had only given permission to Pollack to release it.\n\nFour years later she secured an injunction to stop it from being shown at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals.\n\nFollowing the showing at DOC NYC, \"Amazing Grace\" will have weeklong Oscar-qualifying runs in Los Angeles and New York.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nSeis personas fueron arrestadas como parte de una investigaci\u00f3n sobre un presunto complot para atacar al presidente Emmanuel Macron\n\n(CNN) - Seis personas vinculadas a la extrema derecha fueron arrestadas en Francia el martes como parte de una investigaci\u00f3n sobre un presunto complot para atacar al presidente Emmanuel Macron, dijeron el martes las autoridades a la CNN.\n\n\n\nMIRA: Critican a Emmanuel Macron por una foto junto a dos j\u00f3venes en el Caribe\n\nLa agencia de inteligencia de Francia, la DGSI, dijo que las seis personas fueron arrestadas en tres regiones separadas: Is\u00e8re, al sureste de Lyon; Moselle, en la frontera con Alemania y Luxemburgo; e Ille-et-Vilaine, en el noroeste cerca de la ciudad de Rennes.\n\nLos sospechosos incluyen cinco hombres y una mujer entre las edades de 22 y 62 a\u00f1os, dijo a CNN una fuente judicial cercana a la investigaci\u00f3n.

a new study . One in 100 women who considered themselves morning people developed breast cancer, compared with two in every 100 women who called themselves evening people.\n\nCancer risks associated with a person's body clock and sleep patterns have been reported in previous research and the UK researchers wanted to explore sleep traits in more detail, as well as any genetic factors underlying this.\n\nSelf-reported preferences for mornings or evenings (by their own definition of that preference) were recorded in more than 180,000 women, led by Dr. Rebecca Richmond, research fellow in the Cancer Research UK Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Program and the Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, and presented Tuesday at the NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow.\n\nRichmond's team also analyzed genetic variants linked to whether someone is a morning or night person in more than 220,000 women to find out if these could help provide a causal link to breast cancer.\n\nThis type of statistical model, called Mendelian randomization, showed that people whose genes made them more likely to be early risers were less likely to develop breast cancer by as much as 48%, as shown from the 220,000 participants in the study.\n\nThe second analysis, using self-reported data on sleep from 180,000 participants, showed a similar trend of early rising women having a 40% lower risk of breast cancer. The variation is due to technical differences, stated Richmond.\n\nWomen who self-reported sleeping more than the average seven to eight hours per night were also found to have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, of 20% per extra hour slept, according to the team's Mendelian randomization analysis.\n\nBut the team point out that many factors are involved in a person developing breast cancer and that these numbers are not an absolute risk. Also, the findings cannot be applied across populations as the majority of women included were of European ancestry.\n\n\"Sleep is likely to be an important risk factor for breast cancer, but it isn't as large as other well-established risk factors like BMI or alcohol,\" said Richmond.\n\nThe American Cancer Society says 45% of cancer deaths in the United States are linked to modifiable risk factors, such as cigarette smoke, excess body weight, eating red and processed meat and physical inactivity. Around 4% of US cancer deaths were linked to drinking alcohol and the Breast Cancer Now charity warns that any alcohol intake increases the risk of breast cancer. And obesity is set to become the leading preventable cause of breast cancer for women in the UK, according to a report from earlier this year.\n\n\"We know that sleep is important generally for health,\" said Richmond. \"These findings have potential policy implications for influencing sleep habits of the general population in order to improve health and reduce risk of breast cancer among women.\"\n\nOur circadian rhythms, or body clocks, control bodily functions such as sleep patterns, blood pressure and metabolism and when disturbed can increase the risk of cancers and other diseases.\n\nRichmond's team conducted their genetic analysis in hope of digging into possible causes and consequences of this link. However, experts warn more research is needed and the existing findings cannot be applied more widely.\n\n\"The statistical method used in this study, called Mendelian randomization, does not always allow causality to be inferred,\" said Dipender Gill, clinical research training fellow at Imperial College London. \"For example, the genetic determinants of sleep may also affect other neuronal mechanisms that affect breast cancer risk independently of sleep patterns. In such a scenario, sleep patterns may be associated with risk of breast cancer, but not directly cause it.\"\n\nStephen Burgess, a post doctoral fellow at the University of Cambridge added that a mechanism to explain the link is also not known or understood.\n\n\"The authors do not show any biological mechanism by which sleep timing preference could influence breast cancer risk. Another limitation is that sleep timing preference (chronotype) is self-reported, and the investigation did not specifically recruit individuals with different sleep patterns, such as night-shift workers,\" Burgess wrote in the comments of the study.\n\nThe study has yet to be published in a medical journal. Gill added that it has not been peer-reviewed by other experts in the field yet.\n\nNot as large as other factors\n\nRichmond stressed that the 48% lower risk was identified among \"extreme\" cases, where people identified themselves as \"definite\" morning people out of the five categories they could chose from -- definite morning, more morning than evening, neither, more evening than morning, definite evening.\n\n\"Sleep is likely to be an important risk factor for breast cancer,\" she said. But it isn't as large a risk factor as other well established ones, such as weight or alcohol consumption, added Richmond.\n\nNight owls shouldn't be worried by the findings, said Richmond. \"I wouldn't support that women should get up earlier to reduce risk of breast cancer.\"\n\nThere are theories around the causes of sleep's effect on cancer, she said, such as the idea that artificial light at night leads to hormonal disruption.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDr. Sowmiya Moorthie, senior policy analyst in epidemiology at PHG Foundation, who was not involved in the research, added that the study's major strength is the use of \"multiple approaches to examine the links between sleep traits and breast cancer, which allows the researchers to demonstrate consistency in their findings.\"\n\n\"In terms of the implications of the research, it supports existing evidence that sleep patterns influence cancer risk, but it remains unclear how individual preferences for early or late rising interact with actual sleep behaviours,\" Moorthie wrote in an email.",

Emmanuel Macron, officials told CNN Tuesday.\n\nFrance's intelligence agency, the DGSI, said the six people were arrested in three separate regions: Is\u00e8re, southeast of Lyon; Moselle, on the border with Germany and Luxembourg; and Ille-et-Vilaine, in the northwest near the city of Rennes.\n\nThe suspects include five men and a woman between the ages of 22 and 62, a judicial source close to the probe told CNN. All have connections to the far-right, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The investigation is looking into an imprecise and loosely formed plan for violent action against the President of the Republic,\" said the judicial source, who declined to be named discussing an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe arrests come after Macron warned in an interview with Le Courrier Picard on Sunday of the rising threat of the far-right movement, adding that complacency in the early 1900s paved the way for Hitler's rise in Germany and Mussolini in Italy.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Rebel Wilson stirred controversy recently when she announced she was the first plus-size woman to star in a romantic comedy and has now apologized for it.\n\nIn a recent appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" the Australian actress talked about her role in the upcoming film \"Isn't it Romantic.\"\n\n\"I'm kind of proud to be the first ever plus-sized girl to be the star of a romantic comedy,\" Wilson said.\n\nTwitter was quick to point out that other plus-size actresses such as Ricki Lake, Queen Latifah and Mo'Nique (all of whom are now more svelte than in the past) had starred in rom-coms.\n\nWilson defended her comment with tweets of her own.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) \"The Front Runner\" captures what turned out to be pivotal moment in politics and media, zeroing in on the moment when the look-the-other-way mentality about candidates' personal indiscretions forever changed. At its core, too, is how that shift torpedoed the 1988 presidential run by Gary Hart, played with convincing indignation by Hugh Jackman.\n\n\"A lot can happen in three weeks,\" the film notes at the outset, proceeding to chronicle the rapid downfall of Hart's candidacy, after he was exposed cavorting on a yacht with Donna Rice (Sara Paxton). It was, it's noted, not the first time he had strayed from his wife (Vera Farmiga), including separations in the past.\n\nWhat's different, this time, is that Hart is running for president, and -- in a moment of pique -- suggests to a reporter that he'd be bored if he followed him around. Eager to make its mark on the campaign, the Miami Herald seizes on the comment to justify staking out Hart's townhouse, creating a problem that Hart is slow to recognize or acknowledge, snapping \"How is it relevant?\" when the issue of infidelity arises.\n\nDirector Jason Reitman (who co-wrote the script with Jay Carson and reporter Matt Bai, based on the latter's book) provides a lot of inside-baseball looks at both the Hart team and the newsrooms covering it. That includes Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee (Alfred Molina) -- who reminiscences about ignoring John F. Kennedy's marital transgressions, only to be reminded that it's a \"different time.\"\n\nThere's also Hart campaign manager Bill Dixon (J.K. Simmons, as always, terrific), who struggles to convey the magnitude of what's unfolding to his wonky, policy-oriented boss, who insists on waging a \"campaign of ideas,\" already prone to resist the photo ops and family blather that, an aide notes, isn't in his \"comfort zone.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The widow of a Utah mayor fatally shot while serving in Afghanistan met his body in Dover, Delaware, on Tuesday before delivering a poignant statement on the importance of voting, a cause for which her husband was willing to die.\n\nFollowing the dignified transfer in which Jennie Taylor and their two oldest sons welcomed the body of Maj. Brent Taylor back onto American soil, the widow traveled to nearby Camden, where she addressed reporters.\n\n\"To say that our hearts are anything less than shattered would be nothing short of true deceit,\" she said. \"Yet to deny the sacred honor that it is to stand that close to some of the freshest blood that has been spilled for our country would be absolute blasphemy.\"\n\nBrent Taylor died for freedom and democracy, not just in the States -- but in Afghanistan as well, she said.\n\nFrom the Afghan ballot box to America's\n\nAbout two weeks ago, on the day before Afghanistan was slated to hold its first parliamentary election in eight years -- something her husband of 15 years later described as \"beautiful\" -- a 22-year-old lieutenant fresh out of officer training was killed, Jennie Taylor said. Her husband considered the young Afghan soldier a dear friend, she explained.\n\nShe recalled her husband's message a week after the election: \"The strong turnout at that election, despite the attacks and challenges, was a success for the long-suffering people of Afghanistan, and for the cause of human freedom. I am proud of the brave Afghan and U.S. soldiers I serve with. Many American, NATO, and Afghan troops have died to make moments like this election possible.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Mayor killed in service leaves message for US Replay More Videos ...

He temporarily stepped down as mayor to deploy to Afghanistan with the National Guard, according to his biography on North Ogden's website\n\nHe served 12 years as an officer in the Army National Guard, including seven on active duty. Taylor also served multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Brigham Young University graduate left in January for his second tour of duty in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Brent had a profound influence on this community,\" North Ogden City Councilman Phillip Swanson said . \"He was the best of men with the ability to see potential and possibility in everything around him.\"\n\nA final plea to Americans\n\nOn October 28, in his last Facebook post, Taylor applauded the millions of Afghans who defied the Taliban's threats and went to the polls, calling it a success for a war-weary people.\n\nQuoting the ancient Greek historian Thucydides -- \"The secret to happiness is freedom... And the secret to freedom is courage\" -- he noted that his \"dear friend,\" the 22-year-old Afghan lieutenant, was among those who made the ultimate sacrifice \"to make moments like this possible.\"\n\n\"As the USA gets ready to vote in our own election next week,\" he said in closing , \"I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote. And that whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us. 'United we stand, divided we fall.' God Bless America.\"\n\nHe signed his final post with American flag and fist emojis.", "New York (CNN Business) President Donald Trump wants a weaker dollar, but his economic policies have helped make the dollar relatively strong.\n\nThe greenback is up nearly 4.5% so far in 2018 against other major global currencies, including the euro, yen and pound.\n\nFew investing experts expect much to change for the dollar after Tuesday's midterm elections. That's in part because trade policy probably won't change even if Democrats win the House. And interest rates will probably keep rising -- boosting the dollar along with them.\n\nA strong dollar is a sign of a strong economy. But it also comes with potential consequences.\n\nStronger dollar hurts profits for US multinationals\n\nContinued dollar strength could wind up leading to more volatility in the stock market. The stronger dollar is a problem for many large American companies, because it reduces the value of their international sales and profits.\n\nHasbro ( HAS ), Harley-Davidson ( HOG ), Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark ( KMB ) and Gillette owner Procter & Gamble ( PG ) have all warned that the dollar is hurting their results.\n\nSo have industrial companies 3M ( MMM ) and Caterpillar ( CAT ) and Big Pharma giant Pfizer ( PFE ).\n\nThe stronger dollar can also cause trouble for large American firms at home, because it helps make products from overseas cheaper.\n\nOn the flip side, US goods are now more expensive in international markets because of the stronger dollar. That's a particular worry for giant tech hardware companies like Apple ( AAPL ).\n\n\"These big tech companies are global businesses that rely on international markets. If interest rates are rising and the dollar is following suit, that reduces the purchasing power of their foreign customers,\" said Jonathan Curtis, portfolio manager with the Franklin Technology fund.\n\nJJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, conceded that a stronger dollar is a problem. But he thinks the benefits of less expensive imports for American consumers and retailers may offset the profit hit that multinational companies have to take. A healthier US consumer could keep the economy afloat.\n\nDollar strength could backfire\n\nSome warn that the dollar's strength combined with trade war policies could undo America's economic strength.\n\n\"Regardless of the makeup of the House, the President can still influence policy such as trade agreements by issuing executive orders. The prospect of tariffs and a strong dollar is a risk to global growth,\" wrote OppenheimerFunds senior investment strategist Brian Levitt in a recent report.\n\nIf the dollar keeps rising, that could further squeeze not just China but fragile emerging markets like Turkey, Argentina and Indonesia, all of which have debt denominated in dollars.\n\n\"As US economic growth reaches a simmer and global growth slows, the market may view continued hikes as a bearish outcome that would drive the dollar higher, leading to further tightening financial conditions outside the US and exacerbating vulnerabilities in the emerging markets,\" wrote Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management, in a report.\n\nThe dollar's strength could turn out to be the undoing of many other economies around the world -- and that could eventually slow down the US as well.\n\nWhere does Trump stand?\n\nTrump's stances on the dollar have shifted multiple times during his presidency.\n\nFor example, Trump said in January that he wanted a strong dollar, contradicting comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about how a weaker dollar would be good for the United States.\n\nBut more recently, Trump has lamented the dollar's strength -- particularly as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, a move that boosts the dollar's value even further. He tweeted in July that Europe and China were \"manipulating\" their currencies.\n\nChina, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. As usual, not a level playing field... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2018\n\nBarring a major economic slowdown, the Fed is likely to raise rates again in December and several more times throughout 2019.

Trump quiere que sea lo segundo. Los republicanos del Congreso quieren que sea lo tercero. \u00bfAlguno de ellos tiene raz\u00f3n?\n\n8. \u00bfQu\u00e9 har\u00e1 Donald Trump a continuaci\u00f3n?\n\nLas elecciones intermedias suelen ser dif\u00edciles para el partido del presidente. Hay todas las indicaciones de que esto ser\u00e1 as\u00ed. La mayor\u00eda se ajusta para reflejan las lecciones aprendidas (Clinton en 1995, Obama en 2011) y se ubican ante los votantes antes de su reelecci\u00f3n. Pero Trump no es alguien que admite que alguna vez se equivoc\u00f3.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo manejar\u00e1 una p\u00e9rdida?\n\nEl punto: Este es un momento muy importante en nuestra historia pol\u00edtica compartida y en nuestro futuro. Lo que aprendemos hoy informar\u00e1 no solo de la segunda mitad del primer mandato de Trump, sino tambi\u00e9n de lo que hacen los dem\u00f3cratas en respuesta al jefe ejecutivo. Y, lo m\u00e1s importante, c\u00f3mo reaccionan los votantes a todo esto.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629

This has led to the development of superbugs -- bacteria that have become resistant to the main antibiotics used against them -- which present a major threat to global healthcare.\n\nThe study focused on five types of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the European Union and in the European Economic Area.\n\nRead More", "Minneapolis (CNN) It's been a long time since a Democrat has represented this Minnesota district.\n\nSo long that the young voters seen as key to this battleground haven't been alive to see one.\n\nAnd in many cases, neither have their parents.\n\nBut the seat is seen as a key pickup opportunity for Democrats. Hillary Clinton won the district in 2016.\n\nDean Phillips, in rear, a candidate for Minnesota's 3rd District, is counting on young voters to get to the polls and vote for him.\n\nAnd in this race, challenger Dean Phillips believes his route to victory can be helped by people who have never voted before, by young people motivated by the Parkland school massacre and other generational issues.\n\nOne of those supporters is Sam Simonet, 18, from Minnetonka, who is committed to voting for the first time, and says he is far from alone.\n\n\"I think young people are starting to see that voting can save their lives, voting can put people in office that are going to make decisions and create policies that will help them stay alive in their day-to-day life.\"\n\nSam Simonet, here protesting at Rep. Paulsen's office, has campaigned for Dean Phillips.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the concerns of the youth bloc are what persuaded Phillips, 49, to run.\n\n\"I'm the father of two teenage daughters and I watched that election with them that night in November of 2016, and I remember their reaction -- their fear, their anxiety, their tears,\" Phillips said of Trump's win and the Republicans retaining control of the House and Senate.\n\n\"They represent an entire generation that I think has realized that they, too, have a responsibility, a unique responsibility to take action, and I made a promise to them the next morning at the breakfast table that I would do something.\"\n\nPhillips, a liquor heir and grandson of Pauline Phillips, the \"Dear Abby\" columnist, became a first-time candidate, one of thousands who stood up after Trump's election to try to effect change in the midterms.\n\nAnd from the outset he called on young voters to help, setting up his \"Dean's List\" to attract the newly enfranchised and get them to the polls.\n\nThe team are aware of the stigma about younger people -- they just don't vote -- and Phillips shares the harsh statistics of turnout at a meeting of his young supporters.\n\n\"But we're going to change that!\" one girl shouted out.\n\nThis could indeed be the year that youth turnout increases substantially and has an impact on the outcome of key races.\n\nIn previous years, young voters appeared to have energy except when it came to actually casting a ballot. Census Bureau statistics show that in 2014 , less than 20% of eligible voters aged 18-29 cast a ballot. That compares to nearly 60% participation among Americans aged 65 to 74.\n\nA new national poll from the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics showed significant increases in engagement , with 40% of Americans under 30 saying they definitely plan to vote in the midterms, compared with 23% who said the same in 2014 and 31% in 2010. Historically, the actual turnout is lower than the survey suggests, but 2018 could still see a \"youth wave.\"\n\nCollege student Simonet pledges that this year, the talk will turn to action.\n\n\"I think Parkland was really the biggest turning point in US history for young people, because the day after, the weeks after, marches in the streets were happening,\" he said.\n\n\"I just want people to know that being young doesn't correlate with being uninformed,\" he said.\n\nBob Small, here with his wife Marilyn, has told his grandson Sam Simonet he will switch his vote to the Democrat.\n\n\"We're not just lazy teenagers sitting on the phone. We see a lot of the effects of policy in everyday life in school, in the policies implemented in school. And ... most of the policies are affecting young people more and more today -- with college tuition, with how schools are set up, with the security in schools, and kids know that the decisions being made in Congress are going to affect them as young people a lot and sometimes a lot more than people of older generations.\"\n\nSimonet's viewpoint doesn't stop with his own vote. He's even influenced his 91-year-old grandfather, Bob Small, who told Simonet he will vote for a Democrat after a lifetime of supporting Republicans, he said.\n\n\"He just saw through the lens of me,\" Simonet said.\n\nErik Paulsen easily won re-election in 2016, even as voters in his district opted for Clinton over Trump.\n\nPaulsen has been a successful vote-getter in Minnesota's 3rd District, even as it has swung between Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. Now he sometimes distances himself from Trump, and his campaign website paints him as bringing \"hard-working, reform-minded leadership.\"\n\nHis campaign did not make him or anyone available to CNN to talk about their battle and the youth vote.\n\nIn his district, even high schoolers too young to vote are determined any \"youth wave\" will not be a flash in the pan.\n\nEleanor Dolan wears items supporting the March for Our Lives movement while campaigning for Dean Phillips.\n\nEleanor Dolan, 15, and Braden Johnson, 17, said they were motivated by the Parkland school attack where 17 students and staff were killed, and by active shooter drills in their own schools and seeing Parkland survivors becoming politically active.\n\nDolan campaigns for Phillips wearing a shirt commemorating the \"March for Our Lives\" that students led after Parkland, and is committed to voting even if that is two cycles away.\n\n\"It was like a flip of a switch,\" Johnson said of the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas massacre. \"That's why the numbers are going to go up in the 2018 midterm for that 18 to 24 range.\"\n\nDavid Hogg, right, is one of the Parkland survivors who has traveled around the country to persuade young people to register and vote.\n\nThat would gratify Parkland survivor David Hogg. He has hit the road not to endorse candidates, but to promote the importance of voting and show the next step for those who walked out of school a month after the massacre to call for action on gun violence.\n\n\"Even if we got a fraction of the kids that walked out to vote, the millions of kids that walked out to vote. ... Even a small fraction of that would make a huge difference in so many elections across the United States,\" Hogg said during a stop at a New York school registration drive.\n\nActivating the youth vote isn't just about gun violence, Hogg and other Parkland students say. It's about raising up the voices of students and young people on issues that matter the most to them in their communities, fellow survivor Delaney Tarr said.\n\n\"If we're focusing just on what happened with Parkland, that's not the entire country,\" she says. \"We knew that the only way to actually truly shift our culture to become one of peace, to become one of empowering young people, was to inspire and bring together every single person, every single young person, no matter their experience, no matter their story ... to have them come together as this unified front.\"\n\nMany issues -- from global warming and the environment to immigration, police brutality and sexual harassment -- motivate young voters, as with any other age group, but sometimes they do not seem to be the priorities of the candidates, says 19-year-old Ramon Contreras, a national field strategist for \"March for Our Lives.\"\n\n\"Identifying with the issues is what both parties are lacking right now,\" he said. \"They're not pushing a message that connects with young people.\"\n\nThe Dean Phillips campaign has used this van to get attention in Minnesota.\n\nThe Harvard survey suggests that younger voters skew Democratic.\n\nIn Phillips' case, he sees the opportunity and has been campaigning at Friday night high school football games, with his revamped milk truck-turned government repair truck and pontoon boat to get their attention. And he's addressed so-called youth issues.\n\n\"If we don't take care of the environment, have clean air, clean water, nothing else matters. If we don't talk about college affordability, nothing else matters. And then there's some issues that are unique to younger demographics that it's important that they advocate for,\" Phillips says.\n\nThe outstanding question remains -- will voters in their teens and 20s make it to the polls?\n\nContreras and other \"March for Our Lives\" students have their answer: \"It's happening.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the names of Braden Johnson and Pauline Phillips.", "(CNN) The hole in the Earth's ozone layer is expected to fully heal within 50 years, climate change experts predict in a new UN report.\n\nA fragile shield of gas around the planet, the ozone layer protects animal and plant life from the powerful ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun.

These facts have led the American Academy of Pediatrics to recommend, in a new policy statement published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, that parents not spank, hit or slap their children. This statement from America's leading group of pediatricians, with 67,000 members, is an update to guidance they issued in 1988 that recommended parents \"be encouraged and assisted in developing methods other than spanking\" to discipline kids.\n\nElizabeth T. Gershoff\n\nThis new statement is especially significant because it reflects decades of critical new research on the effects of corporal punishment and because parents and educators put enormous trust in pediatricians for discipline advice -- almost as much as they trust their own parents and spouses. So when pediatricians say not to spank, there is a very good chance that parents will listen. That is a good thing, because we need to stop hitting our children in the name of discipline. And yes -- spanking is just a euphemism for \"hitting children.\" We do not allow adults to hit each other, but for some reason American society has decided it should be legal and even desirable for adults to hit children. We need to end this double standard and provide children with the same protection from hitting that is given to all adults.\n\nJUST WATCHED Kelly Clarkson defends spanking her kids Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kelly Clarkson defends spanking her kids 01:50\n\nThere are practical reasons to stop spanking. The main one is that it does not work. Some parents may say, \"But it does for my child.\" A child may cry and stop what she is doing in the moment, but numerous studies involving hundreds of thousands of children show that spanking does not make children better behaved in the long run, and in fact makes their behavior worse. It is hard for parents to see this in their day-to-day interactions, but the research is clear: We consistently find that the more a child is spanked, the more aggressive he or she will be in the future.\n\nSpanking also teaches children that it is acceptable to use physical force to get what you want. It is thus no surprise that the more children are spanked, the more likely they are to be aggressive or to engage in delinquent behaviors like stealing.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

fore.\n\nFrom the teenager set to become the youngest F1 driver in British history, to Ferrari's youngest racer in over half a century, we take a look at the prodigious talents who could make a big impact on the circuit.\n\nGeorge Russell -- 'I emailed Toto and he replied 15 minutes later'\n\nAge: 20 Team: Williams Nationality: British\n\n\"It feels surreal that I will now be lining up on the grid, alongside drivers whom I have admired for years,\" said 20-year-old George Russell when news broke he would be racing for Williams next season.\n\nRussell, one of two British rookies on the circuit for 2019, is held in high esteem and from his record as a junior it is clear why.\n\nLike many in the sport, the Englishman started racing go-karts aged eight, quickly graduating to win the British Formula 4 championship in 2014.\n\nThe young driver is not short of chutzpah, either, emailing Toto Wolff at the end of 2014, which led to a meeting with the Mercedes boss.\n\nJUST WATCHED Formula One drivers' dream circuits Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Formula One drivers' dream circuits 02:58\n\n\"I decided to send this email at 10:30 at night, put my phone away and woke up the next morning and Toto had replied literally 15 minutes later!\" Russell told ESPN.\n\nAfter winning the McLaren Autosport BRDC award, Russell's career took off. BMW offered the then 17-year-old a reserve driver role for 2016, as well as a drive for 2017.\n\nBut Gwen Lagrue, head of Mercedes' young driver program, heard that the Briton was contemplating racing in the DTM touring car series and immediately arranged for Russell to get in the F1 team's simulator.\n\n\"I took the option deal with Mercedes and did the simulator stuff with them,\" said Russell of the decision to reject a BMW deal which would immediately have secured his financial future.\n\nAs it turned out, he hasn't had to wait long for his chance in F1. After winning the GP3 championship in his rookie year, Russell progressed to Formula 2, F1's feeder series, and currently leads the championship.\n\nThough not 21 until February, having been part of Mercedes' young driver program for two years he has experience in the sport as reserve driver for Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes team, as well as testing several times for both Mercedes and Force India.\n\n\"It has been a perfect progression and slope into a full-time race seat and I really feel that now I am ready for this,\" Russell told BBC Sport following Williams' announcement in October.\n\nCharles Leclerc -- 'The pressure is not something I'm suffering from'\n\nAge: 21 Team: Ferrari Nationality: Mon\u00e9gasque\n\nLeclerc dominated F2 on his way to the title in 2017\n\nFerrari, usually more conservative with their appointments, has promoted 21-year-old Charles Leclerc to ride alongside Sebastian Vettel next season. \"Dreams do come true,\" Leclerc, who was a member of the Ferrari driver academy, posted on Twitter.\n\nLeclerc's rise to replace Kimi Raikkonen in a title-challenging car -- he is the youngest driver to have been appointed by Ferrari since Ricardo Rodriguez raced in the Italian Grand Prix in 1961 -- is remarkable.\n\nFerrari's late president Sergio Marchionne made the call back in June to promote Leclerc on the back of an impressive rookie season with Sauber. He finished sixth in Baku in only his fourth race and, so far, has amassed 27 championship points.\n\nJUST WATCHED Vettel: 'Rather have Kimi' than Lewis on team Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Vettel: 'Rather have Kimi' than Lewis on team 02:53\n\nMarchionne was not the only one at Ferrari to regard Leclerc -- who dominated F2 last season on his way to the title -- as an exciting talent, with the Monaco-born driver still awarded a seat despite Marchionne's death in the summer.\n\nLeclerc had to overcome heartache to reach the pinnacle of the sport. In a statement released on the day it was announced he had earned a Ferrari seat, he paid tribute to his late father, as well as his friend and godfather Jules Bianchi, who died in 2015 -- nine months after a crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nThe soon-to-be Ferrari protege has recently said he's not \"suffering\" from the pressure of expectation.\n\n\" I don't think this will be an issue next year,\" he told reporters. \"Obviously already this year there was quite a bit of expectations on me doing well, and again next year it's more or less the same thing.\n\n\"So, I'm just trying to focus on my job, and trying to extract all these expectations out of my mind, and to really 100% focus on what I do behind the wheel.\"\n\nLando Norris -- 'It's hard to say what I want to achieve next season'\n\nAge: 19 Team: McLaren Nationality: British\n\nNorris is the youngest ever karting world champion\n\nNot 19 until November 13, Lando Norris will become the youngest F1 driver in British history when he jumps into his McLaren at the Australian GP next March.\n\nZak Brown, McLaren's chief executive, has described the English teenager as an \"immense talent,\" anointing the prodigious driver as the racer to help the team rebuild and become the force it was a decade or so ago, when winning titles -- not languishing towards the back of the grid -- was routine.\n\nNico Rosberg, the former Mercedes F1 world champion, has also described Norris as a \"great British sensation,\" so much is expected of the youngest winner of the world karting championship.\n\nNorris is a veteran of seven different junior motorsport categories and a champion in three. In 2017, he became the youngest winner of the prestigious European Formula Three series.\n\nPhotos: Story of the F1 season Lewis Hamilton celebrates his 10th win of the season as he takes the Brazilian GP ahead of Max Verstappen and Kimi Raikkonen.

MUST WATCH Pierre Gasly: 'Pure joy' at Red Bull promotion 02:40\n\nBut Gasly's rise has been meteoric. Like many of his contemporaries, he has proven himself in GP2 (now F2), winning the title in 2016 in the last race of the season in Abu Dhabi. He was also racing in the Japanese Super Formula Championship before Toro Rosso came calling with a full-time F1 contract.\n\nAfter accruing 29 points so far this season for Toro Rosso, including a fourth-place finish in Bahrain, the 22-year-old received a call last month from Red Bull's Helmut Marko which caught him by surprise.\n\n\"It's been just pure joy to realize part of my dream to become a Formula One driver and then 10 months later to get the news that I will race for Red Bull Racing in 2019,\" Gazly told CNN. \"It's been an amazing last few months.\"\n\nNow that he's part of the so-called big three -- alongside Mercedes and Ferrari -- Gasly will have his sights set on podium finishes.\n\n\"You are fighting right up there ... more race responsibilities, more pressure, a harder challenge,\" he said. \"But I'm a really competitive guy and that's what I love so I'm really excited about it.\"\n\nAntonio Giovinazzi -- 'A dream come true'\n\nAge: 24 Team: Sauber Nationality: Italian\n\nOn announcing Antonio Giovinazzi was to race for Sauber in 2019, a team statement said the decision fitted its \"tradition of discovering and nurturing young talents.\" A young driver who has caught the eye of Ferrari is certainly one to watch.\n\nThe 24-year-old will partner Kimi Raikkonen next season, having been placed at the Swiss team by Ferrari as he is a member of the Italians' young driver program.\n\n\"As an Italian, it is a huge honor for me to represent a brand as iconic and successful as Alfa Romeo in our sport,\" said Giovinazzi on joining Sauber.\n\nGiovinazzi raced twice for Sauber at the start of the 2017 season, stepping in for the injured Pascal Wehrlein to become the first Italian to compete in F1 since Jarno Trulli and Vitantonio Liuzzi in 2011.\n\nIt will come as no surprise to learn that Giovinazzi first dipped his toe in motorsport through karting, winning the Italian championship as well as the 60cc European title in his first year.\n\nIn 2012, the then 19-year-old won the Formula Pilota China title in his debut season in single-seaters and progressed to Formula 3 the following season. In 2015, he was runner-up to Felix Rosenqvist in the F3 European Championship.\n\nThis will be his first full-time race seat since the 2016 GP2 season, when he was runner-up to Gasly in the title race but did enough to impress Ferrari in the process.", "Queen performs at Live Aid in London in 1985. (Neal Preston)\n\nIt\u2019s been more than 33 years since Queen, spearheaded by their electric front man Freddie Mercury, charged onto the stage of the 1985 Live Aid concert and performed the set often lauded as the greatest live gig of all time.\n\nThe release of \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d the Queen biopic starring Rami Malek as Mercury, has provoked a swell of nostalgia and emotion around that moment in musical history. In the spirit of the unabashedly uncool band itself, I\u2019d like to add my voice to the chorus.\n\nQueen frontman Freddie Mercury performs at the Live Aid show. (Neil Leifer/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images)\n\nFirst, a confession: I wasn\u2019t even alive when Queen played Live Aid. I was born three years later in 1988, three years before Mercury died of bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.\n\nMy first proper introduction came when I was about seven, when someone had left the TV on at home. There was a documentary about Queen, whose thumping, chanty music I had recently identified as \u201cmore entertaining than the Beatles\u201d on car journeys. I sat down. By the time the program reached the Live Aid concert, I was hooked. By the end of that segment I was in love with Mercury, and when half an hour later I learned that he was dead, I was heartbroken.\n\nFans cheer during Queen\u2019s performance. The charity event was raising money for Ethiopia, which was in the midst of famine. (Norbert Foersterling/DPA/ZUMA Press)\n\nConfronted with everything in such quick succession, the tragedy and speed of his death a few years later seemed only to amplify the potency of Mercury\u2019s most glorious performance. It felt as though having been allotted his finite portion of life, he had spent it in lavish, outrageous bursts, sharing delightedly with that crowd on July 13, 1985.\n\nSince then, I have watched the set many times, its exuberance and energy undiminished over the 23 years since that first viewing. This is a far from exhaustive account of why, for me, it remains magical.\n\nMercury performs at Live Aid with Queen\u2019s lead guitarist, Brian May. (Popperfoto/Getty Images)\n\nQueen didn\u2019t open or close the Live Aid show. They performed just before 7pm, uncharacteristically in daylight, bookended by gigantic acts like U2, Elton John and David Bowie.\n\nPast their peak and reeling from the catastrophe of a misadvised run of shows in apartheid South Africa the previous year, Queen was not expected to shine. Mercury, in particular, had been the focus of disparaging coverage and rumors in the press, where speculation over his sexuality had arguably choked the band\u2019s attempts to break into the American market.\n\nMercury was in peak form at the show. (Georges De Keerle/Getty Images) May plays for the crowd at Wembley Stadium. (Tony Mottram/UPPA/ZUMA Wire)\n\nAmid an atmosphere charged with pessimism, Mercury danced out on stage and welcomed the crowd like his dearest friend. By the time he sat down at the piano and hit the first few notes of \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d he was the absolute master of the stadium.\n\nOver the next 21 minutes, his audience, and the 1.9 billion people watching on TV around the world, fell in love with him. His humor, his hyper-masculine yet fantastically camp energy and that phenomenal four octave voice were irresistible.\n\nDuring the Live Aid show, Queen played many of its greatest hits. (LFI/Avalon/ZUMA Press)\n\nMercury was a brilliant sight. He had stripped his look to the bare essentials \u2014 white tight jeans, trademark moustache, a white tank top showing off his chest and arms, a studded band hugging his right bicep. The whole group, absent their flamboyant 1970s costumes and set paraphernalia, proved they didn\u2019t need them. There was no distraction from the performance.\n\nBrian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon, his fellow bandmates, executed their role \u2014 that of Mercury\u2019s foil \u2014 magnanimously. As a modest May mused years later: \u201cThe rest of us played okay, but Freddie was out there and took it to another level.\u201d\n\nMercury is seen backstage at the Live Aid concert. On the left is his boyfriend, Jim Hutton. (Dave Hogan/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nMercury was indeed a born ringmaster. There was no alienating affectation, no wallowing in sentiment. Where other bands might have been complacent, Queen swept through a distilled serving of their greatest and most bombastic hits to date, well-rehearsed over several days beforehand, with a swagger that never milked anything at the expense of the audience.\n\nThe only pause came at the end of \u201cRadio Ga Ga,\u201d which Mercury performed at the edge of the stage, pumping his sawn-off mic at the crowd. For just over 30 seconds, he led them in a vocal improvisation, which was later christened \u201cthe note heard around the world.\u201d He carried the audience, his winks and nods making the triumph a shared one, blown kisses and thrusting hips an assurance that he was as turned on by everyone as everyone was by him.\n\nMercury, at center in the red shirt, is joined by George Michael, Bono, Paul McCartney and others during the Live Aid show at Wembley Stadium. (Georges De Keerle/Getty Images)\n\nQueen consciously wrote their songs as vehicles for theatrics, and that day, it set them apart. They closed their set with \u201cWe Are The Champions,\u201d an anthem built to amplify with the size of its audience. Mercury, having flown across the stage for the entire show, returned to the piano for the start of the song, echoing the set\u2019s opening, but then came back to the crowd for the climax. He took nothing for granted, his remarkable vocals flawless till the end, even as he basked in his indisputable victory at the edge of the stage.\n\nThe brilliance of that set didn\u2019t only reverberate around the world that summer. It has rippled through every viewing thereafter. For a man whose death is so focal in the history of HIV/AIDS, Mercury remains undefined by it.

And we have,\" he said.\n\nTrump claimed in October that he was able to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico thanks to his hard-nosed tactics, including a willingness to impose new tariffs.\n\n\"Without tariffs, we wouldn't be talking about a deal,\" Trump said. He then mocked politicians opposed to tariffs as \"babies.\"\n\nTrump imposed tariffs earlier this year on steel and aluminum imports coming from around the world, including from allies like Canada and Mexico . He also threatened to impose new tariffs on autos, and has levied taxes on $250 billion of Chinese goods as his administration continues to talk with China about a new bilateral trade deal.\n\nTrump and Trudeau have had a rocky relationship over trade. In June, the 46-year-old Canadian prime minister said after hosting the G7 summit in Quebec that he would be willing to retaliate over the metal tariffs -- which he then did. \"Canadians, we're polite, we're reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around,\" Trudeau said.\n\nHis comments drew immediate fire from top Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who told CNN at the time that Trudeau \" kind of stabbed us in the back .\"\n\nBut in his interview Monday, on the eve of the US midterm elections, Trudeau stepped carefully around questions about his relationship with Trump, who personally called him \"dishonest and weak\" in a tweet over the retaliatory tariffs.\n\nBoth Canada and Mexico have responded to Trump's tariffs by levying taxes on US goods including yogurt, cheese, pork, maple syrup and bourbon.\n\n\"In politics, you get called a lot of things by a lot of different people,\" Trudeau said Monday, when asked directly about Trump's personal attacks.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trudeau: 'Our connection with the US runs deep' Replay More Videos ...

But the connections between Canada and the US run so deep and so broad that the relationship is going to be fine regardless of who's at the top on either side.\"\n\nTrump's tariffs on steel and aluminum and Canada's and Mexico's retaliatory tariffs remain in place. A Mexican official has suggested they won't sign the new agreement until Trump lifts the duties. All three parties are due to sign it at the end of November, before a new Mexican president comes into office.\n\nTrudeau said he wouldn't yet back out of the NAFTA replacement, which Trump has called the US-Canada-Mexico Agreement, or USCMA.\n\n\"We're not at the point of saying that we wouldn't sign if it wasn't lifted -- although we're trying to make that case,\" Trudeau said. He added: \"We would much rather have genuine free trade with the United States so we're gonna continue to work, as soon as we can, to lift those tariffs.\"\n\nIn his conversation with Harlow, Trudeau repeatedly underscored his political and philosophical differences with Trump.\n\nHarlow asked Trudeau about his father, former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, teaching him to trust people and followed up by asking if the Canadian leader trusts Trump. Trudeau sidestepped the question.\n\n\"What my father taught me was to trust Canadians,\" Trudeau said. \"It was a way of looking at the electorate, of saying, you don't have to dumb it down for them, you don't have to scare them into this and that, you can actually treat people like intelligent, rational actors and they will rise to the occasion,\" Trudeau said.\n\nAsked about the importance of a free press, which Trump often calls \"the enemy of the people,\" Trudeau said \"I have been unequivocal, repeatedly, that a free press is fundamental to any democracy around the world, any free society.

At every direction there is merely glistening whiteness, low glaring sun as far as the eye can see, reflecting off the blinding white snow.\n\nIn the frozen landscape at his feet, he carves out a haunting phrase: \"I am the Antarctic.\"\n\nHe snaps a photograph of the scene.\n\nNow this evocative image forms one of the most memorable photographs in David Grann 's new book \" The White Darkness \" -- a thrilling work of nonfiction charting the polar expeditions of a latter-day British explorer, Henry Worsley, and the adventures of his predecessor -- and idol -- Ernest Shackleton, in the early 1900s.\n\n\"All you see in this image is nothing but this white, icy scape and then this strange graffiti that he had written,\" says Grann, who is a staff writer at The New Yorker and author of acclaimed book \"The Lost City of Z.\"\n\n\"The White Darkness\" is published by Doubleday -- a division of Penguin Random House -- but started life as an enthralling long-read in The New Yorker in February 2018. Its title is taken from one of Worsley's audio dispatches:\n\n\"Anyway, I'm back on track and now happy I can part a straight line, even through another day of the white darkness.\"\n\nExplorer Henry Worsley carved this chilling message into the Antarctic while trekking the polar region, alone. Courtesy Lou Rudd\n\nBoth Worsley and Shackleton's stories, interwoven by Grann in his book, are tales of endurance, questioning the meaning of heroism and why some of us are driven to push ourselves to the extreme.\n\n\"I think there is always kind of a mystery at the heart of what drives humans to test themselves,\" says Grann. \"They can never be easily or in any kind of simple psychological way explained.\"\n\nIf Worsley and Shackleton are Grann's heroes, the Antarctic is the enigmatic anti-hero, the brutal-but-beautiful, not-quite-villain who has an irrevocable hold over both men.\n\n\"I think one of the great challenges was not just understanding Henry but was also trying to understand that environment [...] . Antarctica is really a place unto itself. It's more like contemplating Mars than it is contemplating a part of Earth,\" says Grann.\n\nEndurance\n\nErnest Shackleton's story began on South Georgia Island, a glacier-covered island about eleven hundred miles eastwards of Cape Horn, Chile, which Shackleton called \"the Gateway to the Antarctic.\" Courtesy Royal Geographical Society\n\nShackleton is best remembered for two of history's most successful failures.\n\nIn 1907, aged just 33, he led an expedition to Antarctica with three other men -- determined to reach the South Pole.\n\nBy late 1908, only 97 nautical miles from the Pole, he calculated that it wasn't safe to continue and his men turned around. At the time, it was still the southernmost point reached by humans.\n\nFlash forward to 1914 and Shackleton had a new goal -- to complete the first land crossing of Antarctica. But not long after setting out on this odyssey, a band of fellow explorers in tow, Shackleton's ship \"Endurance\" became encased in ice. Over an unforgiving, testing icy winter, the Endurance was slowly crushed and sunk into the freezing waters below.\n\nIncredibly, Shackleton's leadership ensured his entire crew survived in brutal conditions throughout the testing months that followed. In \"The White Darkness\" Grann writes that Shackleton \"almost insisted\" that they remain cheerful.\n\nExpedition photographer Frank Hurley documented the incredible trek through the brutal, but beautiful, landscape. Courtesy Royal Geographical Society\n\nAfter the ship was lost, Shackleton and his crew dragged the salvaged lifeboats across the ice, surviving for 17 months in pop-up camps in crazy conditions.\n\n\"He always rescued his people from certain death and he emerged as one of history's greatest leaders,\" Grann says.\n\nNow Shackleton's the subject of self-help books and business manuals, inspiring everyone from astronauts to Wall Street brokers. But in Shackleton's own lifetime, his exploits were soon eclipsed by more successful polar expeditions.\n\nThat's because our definition of heroism, Grann says, changes with the era.\n\n\"I do think heroes are in many ways a reflection of our times, because they reflect who society chooses to elevate among so many people who are doing various deeds,\" the writer muses.\n\nRelated content On the hunt for the lost city of Z\n\nFollowing in Shackleton's footsteps\n\nHenry Worsley, pictured, was a British army veteran inspired to follow in Shackleton's footsteps.

No one who knew him was surprised when he decided, in 2008, to embark on a centenary Antarctic South Pole expedition with Will Gow, a descendent of Shackleton and Henry Adams, the great-grandson of another crew-member.\n\nThis atmospheric photo was taken on Worsley, Gow and Adams' centenary expedition. Courtesy William Gow\n\n\"Henry wasn't a religious person, but I think he always felt this deep spirituality about the Antarctic -- and of course he liked the idea that he would be in a place that had been untrodden,\" says Grann.\n\nWorsley, Gow and Adams were pushed to extremes in their Antarctic trek, exposed to impossibilities they couldn't have fathomed before they arrived in the ice blue, empty far South landscape.\n\nBut Worsley, inspired by Shackleton and driven by his own thirst for adventure and exploration, helped his men remain committed to their goal.\n\n\"He was an officer and he served tours with the SAS and he was always repeating this -- their motto: \"A little further a little further.\" And he always repeated the line from Shackleton's family motto: \"By endurance we conquer,\" says Grann.\n\nIncredible images\n\nAfter they lose the Endurance, Shackleton's crew dragged lifeboats across the ice. Courtesy Getty\n\nWhen Shackleton's ship, Endurance, became enveloped by the Antarctic's deadly ice, his expedition photographer Frank Hurley continued to document events that followed. He salvaged the camera equipment and trekked through the Antarctic with it in tow.\n\nHis resulting photographs are cinematic in their scope -- especially those of the imposing, iconic ship, forever to remain in the frost. Then there's the men exploring the ethereal dreamscape of the Antarctic. Lit by flares, the images take on a striking effect, chilling and captivating all at once.\n\nOn Worsley's 2008 expedition, his colleague Gow took his own vibrant photographs of the impossible landscape. Worsley, too, documented his adventures with photography.\n\n\"These photos are just really quite remarkable and they get to some of the things that we've talked about -- which are just trying to wrap your mind around this landscape, trying to wrap your mind around these people setting off in this immense landscape,\" says Grann.\n\nSastrugi is the term for these hard ridges on the snow and ice, sculpted by strong winds.

In many images, the outlook is almost a total white-out, with the red of the tent the only color visible.\n\nWhen, in 2008, Worsley and his fellow explorers reached 88\u00b023'S, the southernmost point reached by their forebears 100 years previously, they recreated the iconic image of Shackleton and his team, wrapped in furs, Union Jack flag blowing in the wind.\n\nThe iconic image of Shackleton and his team in 1908 at 88\u00b023'S.\n\nBut, as Grann notes, reaching this famous point was by definition anticlimactic.\n\n\"They get to this spot that has kind of fueled their dreams and almost lured them to their demise and they look around and there is nothing there, but barren windswept ice. This place, their grail, was really no more than a geographical data point,\" he says.\n\nWorsley and his crew recreated the famous image.

Courtesy William Gow\n\nWorsley returned to Antarctica in 2011, leading a six-strong team retracing Roald Amundsen's journey to the South Pole.\n\nBut even when he was back with his close-knit family -- his wife Joanna and children Alicia and Max -- he still found himself dreaming of the Antarctic wilderness.\n\nWorsley's family are very much at the heart of the story Grann has woven in \"The White Darkness.\"\n\n\"One of the things that really drew me to the story was this remarkable love story at the heart of it between Henry and his wife Joanna,\" says Grann.\n\nHe wanted to achieve a never-before-attained feat. Courtesy William Gow\n\nJoanna, Alicia and Max gave Grann access to Worsley's photographs and diary entries, and spoke to Grann about Worlsey's experiences -- and their own.\n\nHenry's only \"mistress\", Joanna used to joke, was Antarctica.\n\n\"I think everybody is different,\" says Grann. \"I think some people make a journey like that and they do get it out of their system. But for Henry, Antarctica has been inside him since he was young.\"\n\nWorsley was raising money for the Endeavour Fund, a charity that helps wounded army veterans in the UK. Courtesy Joanna Worsley\n\n\"It kind of consumed his imagination, he'd become a leading authority on the Golden Age of Antarctic Exploration and on Shackleton.\"\n\nGrann's story depicts the duality of a man who was deeply committed to his family, but also had this urge to challenge himself, to push himself to endurance and extremes:\n\n\"This man who was [...] a very devoted father and family man and yet had this other obsession that drew him to the most treacherous place, a place that could take life at any moment,\" says Gann.\n\nRelated content The most remote places on Earth\n\nNext step\n\nWorsley sent regular updates back home and wrote about his experiences in his diary. Courtesy William Gow\n\nBack in the UK, Worsley began planning his next feat of endurance -- the first solo trek, unaided, across the Antarctic.\n\n\"He was always setting the compass farther and of course in his final expedition, where he sets out to walk across Antarctica alone and unsupported and unaided was something that nobody had ever dared to do,\" says Grann.\n\nIn \"The White Darkness\", Grann constructs both Worsley and Shackleton's stories like thrillers, edge-of-your-seat tales about finding the unconquerable, flirting constantly with living and dying, the juxtaposition between the \"real\" world and the one of their ambitions.\n\nThe Weddell Sea, home to Berkner Island, pictured here, is where Worsley began his solitary journey.\n\n\"I tried to tell the story from the perspective of people who are going on adventures and they don't know what's going to happen at any moment and death always lurks with every step,\" says Grann. \"So I think in telling it from that perspective it hopefully lets the reader feel both the enormous excitement and the momentary terrors that the people on these expeditions are feeling.\"\n\nIn Grann's book, when Worsley begins his solo trek, the reader feels a sense of foreboding. The explorer was back in this challenging place, alone.\n\nThe picture to the left depicts a man being pulled from a crevasse during explorer Robert Falcon Scott's first Antarctic expedition. On the right, a crevasse is dodged by Worsley's group on the 2008 expedition.\n\nGrann writes how Worsley sent daily audio broadcasts back home and wrote about the treacherous experiences in his diary. Worsley was constantly testing his abilities as a leader, but in his final journey he had what Grann calls \"the most difficult challenge\" -- commanding himself.\n\nBut he was determined to complete his challenging task. In crossing Antarctica unaided, he would raise money for the Endeavour Fund, a charity that helps wounded army veterans in the UK. Britain was behind him -- including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. He was heralded as a hero, a Shackleton for the 21st century.\n\nBut what does it really mean, to be a Shackleton?\n\nOn his final journey, Worsley had what Gann calls \"the most difficult challenge\" -- commanding himself. Courtesy Getty\n\n\"I think to some degree there is a misunderstanding of what made Shackleton great and I think in our societies, we tend to want to always think we could conquer by endurance -- there's this idea that somehow anything can be triumphed and I think people gravitate to Shackleton because of that,\" says Grann.\n\n\"But I think one of the central lessons of Shackleton -- I think one of the central lessons that Worsley grappled with on his last expedition -- is really failure and the fact that we can't conquer everything and the fact that we have human limitations. And I think that's a more profound and difficult lesson to accept.\"\n\nRelated content The most extreme adventures on Earth\n\nHopeful future\n\nWorsley's wife Joanna and children Max and Alicia made a pilgrimage to South Georgia Island in 2017.

If the polls and our forecasts are right, the Democrats and Republicans will each have something to be happy about.\n\nDemocrats are favored to take back the House, while Republicans are favored to maintain control of the Senate.\n\nOur final House forecast has Democrats earning 227 seats to the Republicans 208. That's a net gain of 32 seats from the 195 they hold right now. Democrats only need a net gain of 23 to win the 218 seats necessary for a majority.\n\nBut as we have noted all along, our forecasts come with a margin of error. Specifically, our 95% confidence interval finds that Democrats could win as few as 207 seats (11 short of a majority) to 259, according to our latest estimate.\n\nThere are two things you should note about the range. The first is that it's wide because there are so many close races.\n\nThere are, for example, 32 races that we think will have a margin of 4 points or less. There are 97 races in which the margin of error (95% confidence interval) is wider than the margin by which one of the candidates is projected to win.\n\nOf those 32 races that are within 4 points, 19 are forecasted to be won by the Democratic candidate. If only about half of these 19 go the other way, Republicans could conceivably maintain control.\n\nThe second thing you should note is that the margin of error is asymmetric. That is, the difference between our median estimate (227) and the bottom range of our margin of error (207) is only 20 seats, while the difference between our median and the top range of our margin of error (259) is 32 seats.\n\nThere are an astounding 61 races where the Republicans are favored, but where we think the Democratic candidate is within the margin of error of winning. If there is a small, but systematic, error in the polling, it's not inconceivable that Democrats could do far better than we have forecasted them to do.\n\nThe asymmetric range of our results is why if we were projecting our midpoint using an average instead of a median that would forecast a net gain of 34 seats for the Democrats.\n\nMake no mistake though, the House race is still close enough that Republicans could win. The closeness of the result is such that the seven races within 4 points in California, Maine and Washington could be determinative. It may take some time to count the ballot for various reasons (e.g. mail-in ballots and ranked choice voting) in these contests. That means we may not know the winner for days.\n\nOur final Senate forecast is something else altogether. It has Republicans controlling 52 seats and Democrats (and Independents who caucus with them) holding 48 seats in the next Congress. If this forecast were exactly right, it would mean that Republicans would have a net gain of a seat since the last Congress.\n\nThis overall forecast takes into account each state's forecast, the margin of error of each state's forecast and the correlation between the different state results. In cases where one side is expected to win many close victories, the overall forecast thinks there's a good chance they will lose a few of these contests.\n\nThat's exactly what's going on this year. Right now, our forecast has Democratic candidates winning by 2 points or less in Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri and Nevada. No Republican is forecasted to win by less than 6 points. Based upon past history, the model expects that two of these close forecasted Democratic victories will turn into Democratic defeats. If all these states end up going to the Republicans, they will win 55 seats.\n\nIndeed, we shouldn't underrate the possibility of Democrats winning the House and Republicans doing very well in the Senate tomorrow night.\n\nIf each of our state forecasts is right, however, Democrats will end up 50 seats to the Republicans 50 seats. Vice President Mike Pence would break the tie and give Republicans the barest of majorities in the Senate in this case.\n\nIs it possible that Democrats win control of the Senate? Yes. Our forecasted margin of error gives Democrats the possibility of controlling up to 52 Senate seats in the next Congress.\n\nRight now, the two most likely ways Democrats win the majority in Senate elections held tomorrow involve either Democrat Phil Bredesen winning in Tennessee or Democrat Beto O'Rourke winning in Texas. Both of those races are within 6 points, which means they are within the margin of error.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing scenario for election night is that if neither party wins a Senate majority tomorrow. There is little doubt at this point that the Mississippi Special Senate jungle primary will require a runoff in late November between the two top vote getters on Tuesday. In the jungle primary, all Democrats and Republicans run against each other. If no one receives a majority, there will be a runoff.\n\nThere are two Republicans (Chris McDaniel and Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith) who will split the Republican vote in this very red state. The question is who advances to the runoff.\n\nFor most of the campaign, the polls pointed towards Hyde-Smith making the runoff against Democrat Mike Espy. In such a scenario, Republicans would be heavily favored to hold onto the seat.\n\nThere has been some late polling though that has Hyde-Smith and McDaniel neck-and-neck. If McDaniel beats out Hyde-Smith, this seat becomes very winnable for Democrats.\n\nAnd keep in mind that if we project every other state correctly and it's a Espy-McDaniel runoff, said runoff will be for control of the Senate.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the most recent forecast figures.", "The outcome is a significant victory for Democrats after the party was locked out of power in Washington following the 2016 presidential election . It deals a major blow to Republicans who will lose their majority in the lower chamber and is a significant setback for President Donald Trump's agenda in Congress.\n\nDemocratic leader Nancy Pelosi celebrated the win on Tuesday night at an event in Washington, DC. \"Women and men mobilized in historic numbers who saw what this GOP Congress was doing and refused to stand still,\" Pelosi said, adding, \"Tomorrow will be a new day in America.\"\n\nDrew Hammill, an aide to Pelosi, tweeted Tuesday evening that the President called Pelosi at 11:45 p.m. ET \"to extend his congratulations on winning a Democratic House Majority.\"\n\nCapitol Hill will now have divided party control after Republicans maintained control of the Senate , according to CNN's projection. That could lead to more gridlock and clashes between the two chambers or it could force the two parties to find common ground.\n\nWhile a Democratic victory was far from guaranteed, the party had been viewed as a slight favorite to win the House on Election Day.\n\nUnder a Democratic-controlled House, Democrats will have more authority and fewer constraints on their ability to exercise oversight of the Trump administration and could launch investigations into the President's finances, including going after his tax returns, as well as ramp up a probe into the possibility that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to win the White House, which Trump has denied.\n\nDiscussion about the possibility of impeaching the President is also likely to grow louder in a Democratic-controlled House, despite the fact that Democratic congressional leaders have tried to tamp down on speculation that the party might pursue impeachment -- at least at this point. Even if the House were to move to impeach the President, Republicans could thwart an effort to remove the President from office in the Senate which requires a two-thirds vote in the upper chamber.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Pelosi pledged that a Democratic House will act as a check on the White House and Republicans in Washington.\n\n\"Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans,\" she said. \"It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration. It's about stopping the GOP and Mitch McConnell's assault on Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the health care of 130 million Americans living with pre-existing medical conditions.\"\n\nPelosi previewed the kind of policies Democrats will try to advance in the next Congress, though any legislative agenda could be blocked in the Senate and by the President's veto pen. \"Democrats pledge a Congress that works for the people,\" she said, vowing that the party would work to lower the cost of health care, raise wages and \"clean up corruption to make Washington work for all Americans.\"\n\nAttention will now quickly shift to the question of who will lead the party. Pelosi has said she plans to run for House speaker if Democrats flip the House, but she has also said she views herself as \"a transitional figure,\" fueling speculation about who will one day succeed her and whether she could face a challenge in her bid for the top spot in leadership in a new Congress.\n\nWhen Pelosi spoke at a Democratic victory party on Tuesday night, she took the stage to chants of \"Speaker!\"\n\nRep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi unsuccessfully in 2016, has left the door open to the possibility of challenging the Democratic leader again, while others are mulling a bid only if Pelosi steps aside or if she were to be defeated in a run for speaker. House Democrats are set to hold their leadership elections the week after Thanksgiving.\n\nOn the Republican side, there will be also be a leadership contest as House Speaker Paul Ryan has announced he would not seek re-election. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is viewed as the favorite to succeed Ryan and has already been endorsed by the outgoing speaker. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise may also be interested in climbing the GOP leadership ranks though he has said he would not challenge McCarthy in a race for speaker. GOP House leadership elections are on track to take place the week after the midterm elections.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus -- thought to be the most conservative voting bloc in the House -- launched his own bid for speaker and has been expected to run for leadership even in the event that Democrats won the House. Jordan, often seen as a conservative agitator in the House, is considered a long shot for a leadership post.\n\nThroughout the midterm elections, Republicans had been worried that Democrats would take the House as a so-called \"green wave\" of money flowed to Democratic candidates in the final weeks before the midterms. Fundraising reports from the third quarter of 2018 cemented those fears as Democrats outraised Republican opponents in competitive House races.\n\nTrump ramped up efforts to campaign on behalf of vulnerable GOP candidates in the run up to the midterms. The President framed the election as a choice between what he has described as Republican law and order and a Democratic \"mob\" and spoke extensively about immigration and securing the border in the final days of the fall campaign season.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, prioritized a different message in the midterms and heavily emphasized promises to safeguard health care for voters, including protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "Washington (CNN) CNN projects that Republicans will keep control of the Senate , a result that was not unexpected but still never assured in this unpredictable political environment until voters had their say. The outcome represents a significant victory for the GOP and President Donald Trump.\n\nCapitol Hill will now have divided party control after Democrats won back the House of Representatives from Republicans in the 2018 midterms, according to CNN's projection. That could lead to more legislative gridlock unless the two parties are able to find common ground.\n\nDespite a seemingly energized grassroots electorate, the Democratic Party had been viewed as a long shot to take back control of the Senate where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority of 51 seats to 49 seats for Democrats.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump spoke by phone on Tuesday night, according to an aide, who characterized it as \"a great conversation\" in which McConnell thanked the President for all of his help in the Senate races.\n\nDemocrats faced a daunting Senate map in the 2018 midterms and have been forced to defend 10 seats in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election, including North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Indiana and Missouri. Republicans succeeded in ousting some of those Democrats on Tuesday night, including Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, according to CNN projections. Republicans also fended off challenges from Democrats in the Texas and Tennessee races.\n\nMaintaining control of the Senate paves the way for Republicans to continue advancing the President's agenda in the upper chamber.\n\nIt allows McConnell to push ahead with the ongoing GOP effort to re-shape the federal courts by aggressively confirming conservative judges, a key priority for both the Majority Leader and the President. It also means Senate Republicans can continue to confirm new appointments that may arise for members of the President's Cabinet. A simple majority is all that's needed in the Senate to confirm judicial nominees -- Supreme Court and lower court picks -- and executive branch appointments.\n\nA fight over funding for the President's signature campaign trail promise of a wall along the US-Mexico border looms large when lawmakers return to Washington after the midterms and along with it, the threat of a partial government shutdown.\n\nThe outcome of the midterms marks the culmination of a bitter partisan battle for control of Congress and set the stage for the 2020 elections, where an expansive field of Democratic presidential candidates is expected to challenge Trump after his first term in office. Some high profile senators are expected to be among that growing pool of candidates in the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nThe closing days of the midterm campaign have played out with split screen images of Democrats and Republicans emphasizing different messages to the voters they hope will show up to the polls on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has framed the elections as a choice between law and order maintained by Republicans and an out-of-control Democratic mob, while focusing heavily on hardline immigration campaign promises, including a legally dubious pledge to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants born in the US.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats maintained a nearly unwavering focus on health care in their closing message to voters. Democratic congressional leaders and candidates vowed on the campaign trail that their party will protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, while warning that Republicans will not.\n\nThe final weeks of the campaign season were upended when, in a shocking development, authorities intercepted potential explosive devices targeting top Democratic Party leaders, including former President Barack Obama and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Just days later, tragedy gripped the nation after 11 people were killed in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nThe White House and congressional leaders condemned the incidents, but the events have sparked questions and recriminations over whether heated political rhetoric contributed to the violence.\n\nTrump defiantly rejected the idea that his own rhetoric contributed to the incidents and lamented the week before Election Day that the attacks slowed Republican momentum.\n\n\"We did have two maniacs stop a momentum that was incredible, because for seven days nobody talked about the elections,\" the President said at a Missouri rally last week. \"It stopped a tremendous momentum.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.", "Hong Kong (CNN Business) Facebook has admitted it failed to do enough to prevent its platform being used to fuel political division and bloodshed in Myanmar.\n\nThe company on Monday released a report that it commissioned into the damage caused in the Southeast Asian country by abuses of its social network, including efforts to whip up hatred against the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority group\n\nThe report highlights yet another case of Facebook struggling to manage the rapid spread of hate and misinformation across one of its platforms \u2014 and the impact of those failings on society.\n\nThe United Nations has called for Myanmar's military leaders to be investigated and prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes following a campaign of persecution and killing of Rohingya.

Here's an in-depth, hour-by-hour look at what to watch, and where:\n\nThe first polls close (6 p.m. ET)\n\nPolls close at 6 p.m. ET in most of Indiana and Kentucky . Parts of both states are in the Central time zone, so it'll take time to see whether Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly survives a challenge from Republican businessman Mike Braun.\n\nThe one we'll all be talking about first: Kentucky's 6th District. Amy McGrath, a former combat pilot, is challenging Republican Rep. Andy Barr.\n\nIt might not be a great national bellwether. In an unusual twist -- in part due to the brutal ads Barr has aired -- the race has largely become about McGrath and whether she is too progressive for the district, rather than a referendum on Trump or the incumbent congressman. But it will be an early indicator of the environment, and a Barr loss would give Republicans reason to panic.\n\nExpect to see McGrath up early as the city of Lexington's results come in first -- but the margin is likely to tighten up quickly.\n\nThe early indicators (7-7:30 p.m. ET)\n\nDemocrats saw one more district in Virginia emerge as competitive late in the cycle: the 5th District, where former journalist Leslie Cockburn takes on Republican Denver Riggleman, an Air Force veteran and distillery owner. A Democratic win here would be a sign of a tidal wave threatening to wipe out Republicans whose races weren't even on the national radar.\n\nThe Atlanta suburbs feature two wave-maker districts -- if Democrats win either, it'd mean they're in for a big night. In Georgia's 6th District, Republican Rep. Karen Handel -- who won a ballyhooed special election against Jon Ossoff last year -- faces Lucy McBath, a challenger whose unarmed son was shot and killed over a dispute about loud music . And in the 7th District, Republicans are furious that Rep. Rob Woodall never took his race seriously. \"If you don't think it behooves you to put paid media on air, we're not going to come help you. We're not a welfare organization,\" a Republican official said.\n\nAlso keep your eye on a few wave-makers in Florida . The Tampa-area 15th District is an open seat that emerged as competitive late -- so late, in fact, that Republicans couldn't afford a rescue effort. On the Atlantic coast side, the 6th District's open-seat contest for former Rep. Ron DeSantis' old seat is another potential Democratic pick-up that would suggest the party is soaring past the 23 seats it needs for a House majority. If either of Republican Reps. Brian Mast or Vern Buchanan lose, it's another sign that Democrats are on the path to winning the House.\n\nHistory-makers. In In Georgia , the headliner is the governor's race between Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams, an emerging Democratic star who has combined a progressive platform with an appeal to black voters -- all with a chance to become the nation's first black female governor . If neither candidate tops 50%, the race will head to a runoff.\n\nIn Florida , a small portion of the panhandle is in Central time, so we'll need to wait an extra hour for full results to come in for the governor's race between Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a progressive favorite, and DeSantis, who has aligned himself so closely with Trump that this is a potential preview of 2020.\n\nDemocrats' Senate must-wins. The The Florida Senate contest, with Republican Gov. Rick Scott challenging Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, is one of the nation's most expensive and closely watched -- and if Nelson loses, it would severely diminish Democrats' shot at a majority.\n\nA Midwestern state-level resurgence? Democratic former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Richard Cordray will try to win the Democratic former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Richard Cordray will try to win the governor's office in Ohio , a state Trump won by 9 percentage points in 2016. He faces Republican state Attorney General Mike DeWine. It's the first of several such tests for Democrats, who also hope to reverse GOP gains in Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin.\n\nThe decisive hour (8 p.m. ET)\n\nIf you haven't tuned in yet, this is the time.\n\nControl of the Senate on the line: The Senate majority could come down to two key races in states where the last polls close at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nThe most crucial hour for House control. This could also be the hour in which the next House begins to take shape. The two major battlegrounds are This could also be the hour in which the next House begins to take shape. The two major battlegrounds are Pennsylvania and New Jersey\n\nIn Pennsylvania , where the state Supreme Court made a mid-year decision to redraw the state's congressional district lines, Democrats look likely to pick up four seats -- the open 5th, 6th and 7th districts around Philadelphia, and the 17th District, where Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb and Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus were drawn together into the same suburban Pittsburgh race. One to watch as a sign of a Democratic wave: Whether Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who represents Philadelphia's northern suburbs, holds on. If Republican Reps. Scott Perry (10th District) or Mike Kelly (16th District) start to sweat, it's a disaster for the GOP.\n\nIn New Jersey , Democrats need to win at least two races with two of their strongest recruits of the cycle: the open 2nd District, where conservative Democratic state Sen. Jeff Van Drew is the heavy favorite, and the 11th District, with Mikie Sherrill.\n\nBut it's the next two that would clearly show Democrats on their way to a huge House majority: Republican incumbents Leonard Lance and Tom MacArthur, one of the architects of the House's health care repeal bill who also backed Trump's tax bill, are also in the fights of their political lives. If MacArthur loses, it'd show how potent health care is as an issue for Democrats.\n\nDemocrats could also pick off House seats in Illinois . Sean Casten is their best bet -- he faces GOP Rep. Peter Roskam in the Chicago suburbs. Also near Chicago, Rep. Randy Hultgren faces a stiff challenge from Lauren Underwood, who campaigned with former President Barack Obama over the weekend. The 12th and 13th Districts are two more wave-maker types with GOP incumbents Mike Bost and Rodney Davis.\n\nMore key races to watch this hour:\n\n-- Maine's 2nd District : Can Rep. Bruce Poliquin stave off Democratic challenger Jared Golden?\n\n-- Mississippi Senate : Does Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith hold off conservative Chris McDaniel and advance to a one-on-one runoff against Democratic former Rep. Mike Espy?\n\nThe majority makers (9 p.m. ET)\n\nSuburban revolt? A slew of House seats are up for grabs in the 9 p.m. ET poll closings and, depending on which way states early in the night tilt, a Democratic House majority could come together based on poll closings in Texas, A slew of House seats are up for grabs in the 9 p.m. ET poll closings and, depending on which way states early in the night tilt, a Democratic House majority could come together based on poll closings in Colorado Minnesota and a dozen more states.\n\nAll eyes will be on Minnesota , where Democrats are now poised to turn the state blue two years after it came close to going for Trump in 2016. Democrats appear likely to hold the state's two Senate seats and the governor's mansion, but four closely watched House contests, including two where Democrats are on defense, will indicate how successful Democrats are in breaking down Trump's red wall.\n\nThe big question: Will either party gain House seats in Minnesota , or will it be a wash?\n\nDemocrats are confident in Minnesota's 2nd and 3rd Districts -- where Democrats Angie Craig and Dean Phillips are running against embattled Republican incumbents -- and Republicans have largely written off the two races. But Republican Jim Hagedorn in southern Minnesota and Pete Stauber in the northern reaches of the state are both on offense and party operatives are hopeful they can be two bright stops in what could otherwise be a tough night.\n\nThe poll closing at 9 p.m. ET could also cement 2018 as the year of the suburban revolt against Republicans. Republicans have all but written off Kansas' 3rd and Colorado's 6th districts, both suburban seats currently held by Republicans, but Democratic wins in suburban Dallas with Colin Allred, Houston with Lizzie Fletcher and Detroit with Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens could cement House majorities for Democrats.\n\nHistory in Texas? Texas hasn't elected a state-wide Democrat since 1988. But Rep. Beto O'Rourke, fueled by Democratic enthusiasm and a Brinks Truck worth of cash, has given Sen. Ted Cruz a real race. Polls have the upstart Democrat down and Republicans believe the state's Republican tendencies will be evident on Election Day, but staggeringly high early voting numbers and national attention on the race have given O'Rourke a chance. A win here would be earth-shattering for Democrats.\n\nDemocrats hope that a loss in North Dakota (or earlier in the night) could be erased by a win in Arizona , where two congresswomen -- Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally -- are fighting in a state Trump won in 2016.\n\nThe race has become a judgment on Walker, who is asking voters for a third term in the state, an ask that even Republicans admit makes his re-election difficult.\n\nThe dark horse gubernatorial race of the 9 p.m. ET hour is in South Dakota , where Republican Rep. Kristi Noem is in a surprisingly tough fight against Democrat Billie Sutton, an anti-abortion, pro-gun Democrat who is running to oversee a state that backed Trump by 30 percentage points in 2016.\n\nPut the coffee on (10 p.m. ET and later)\n\nEyeing Orange County. If control of the House comes down to these hours, it's time to make more coffee.\n\nPolls will close on competitive House races in Iowa Nevada and Washington state in this two-hour span -- all states where Democrats believe it is likely they will pick up seats -- but the biggest prize of these late-night hours comes from California , where at least nine House races up and down the state are worth watching.\n\nAn important note: If Democratic control of the House comes down to California, the country is in for a long ordeal. California is notoriously slow at counting votes, meaning races could be decided in days and weeks, not hours.\n\nWhile Democrats are fighting in competitive races throughout California's Central Valley -- where Democrats Josh Harder and T.J. Cox are looking to oust Republicans in districts Clinton won two years ago -- the bulk of Democratic focus will be on Southern California, namely the Los Angeles and Orange County area.\n\nKatie Hill, Gil Cisneros, Katie Porter, Harley Rouda and Mike Levin are the five Democrats looking to flip seats in the traditionally Republican area. Depending on how races earlier in the night go, these five seats in Southern California could either be the cherry on top of a good night for Democrats or the focus of considerable attention over the next weeks.\n\nNevada and Montana Senate contests. The most hotly contested races, though, are in The most hotly contested races, though, are in Montana , where Democrat Jon Tester is looking to hold onto his seat against Republican Matt Rosendale, and Nevada , where Democrat Jacky Rosen is on offense against Republican incumbent Dean Heller.\n\nDemocrats expect to hold Montana, where Tester is running on his connections to the state and authenticity , but Nevada is expected to be a fight, despite that fact that Heller for months has been seen as the most vulnerable Republican incumbent running for Senate this year.\n\nGovernors' races wrap with a late night in Alaska. Democrats are looking to flip gubernatorial seats in Nevada, where Democrat Steve Sisolak and Republican Adam Laxalt are fighting over the governor's mansion currently held by Republicans, and Iowa, where Democrat Fred Hubbell is looking to oust Republican incumbent Kim Reynolds.\n\nA win by either Democrat would cement each as a key figure in the 2020 presidential nomination fight; both Nevada and Iowa are key early states.\n\nThe most unexpected race of the night could be in Alaska , where the current governor, independent Bill Walker, ended his re-election campaign in October to back former Sen.

(Click to view.)", "While much of the national focus has been on Congress, the campaigns have national implications for congressional representation for 2020 and beyond. Democrats and Republicans are pouring millions into these races with that very thing in mind.\n\nSo what themes and trends might emerge when all the ballots are counted?\n\nHere are five:\n\nNew South. Same South.\n\nGeorgia is ground zero. The gubernatorial candidates in this contest couldn't be more different. Stacey Abrams is a black progressive woman. Brian Kemp is a white conservative man. Oprah Winfrey and former President Barack Obama endorsed Abrams. President Donald Trump handpicked Kemp in the GOP primary and stumped for him, as did Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nDemocrats have wanted to turn Georgia blue for years -- the last time voters elected a Democratic governor was in 1998. The key to this race, will be ... race. Can the new Georgia -- increasingly black, Latino and more moderate, suburban whites -- beat the old Georgia, which is whiter and older, and more conservative and rural? The same dynamics are at play in Florida, with Republican Ron DeSantis vs. Democrat Andrew Gillum.\n\nWomen\n\nA record 16 women are on the ballot this year in governors' races. And some, like Abrams, are trying to make history.\n\nLupe Valdez in Texas is vying to become first openly gay Latina governor. Paulette Jordan in Idaho is vying to become the first Native American governor. Christine Hallquist in Vermont is the first major-party transgender nominee. But they are long shots.\n\nMore likely is Kristi Noem, who could become the first woman elected governor in South Dakota. Kim Reynolds could become first woman elected governor in Iowa -- she is the incumbent but was elevated to the post. In Maine, Janet Mills could become first woman elected governor there. But the real test is whether, come 2019, a record number of women are in governors' mansions. The record is nine, in 2004 and 2007.\n\nRust Belt and Midwest\n\nThis region was key to Trump's victory in 2016. He won Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Iowa, and these states all have governors' races. Some are competitive down the stretch and others aren't. Democrats feel good about holding Pennsylvania and flipping Michigan. Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa are possible pickup opportunities for Democrats, two years after Trump won those states by focusing, in part, on trade and working-class white voters.\n\nTrump promised to revive the hollowed-out manufacturing sector, but tariffs and the trade wars have complicated the picture. Overall, manufacturing jobs have been on an upward trend since the last quarters of the Obama administration and are increasing at a record pace. But the heyday for manufacturing jobs is long gone. For every good headline about FoxConn, there are not-so-good headlines about Harley-Davidson and General Motors. Inroads among Democrats in this region will buoy them and leave GOPers worrying.\n\nDemocratic gains\n\nThe Obama years were not good to Democrats. Ten years after Obama was elected, Democrats have just 16 governorships, while Republicans hold 33. This cycle, the GOP is defending 26 seats, while Democrats are defending nine. (Alaska currently has an independent governor, who is not seeking election). Forecasters suggest anywhere from a three- to 12-seat net gain for Democrats, and strategists I talk to say a good night for Democrats would be if they gain six seats. But some victories will be much more meaningful than others. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker, who has been sounding the alarm about a blue wave for months, faces a tough Democratic challenger. A Walker defeat would be a big win for Democrats. In Florida and in Georgia, if Gillum and/or Abrams wins, Democrats would have two big history-making stars and a blueprint for how to successfully harness changing demographics.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nThe President handpicked candidates in three races -- Georgia, Kansas and Florida. If they win, Trump -- and more specifically Trumpism -- will have bragging rights. Wins by Kemp, Kris Kobach and DeSantis will mean that GOP candidates not named Trump have a successful playbook for how to win in a wide array of states, not only in the primary, but also in the general election. Trump injected himself in these races in the waning days, lobbing what many thought were racially coded insults at Gillum and Abrams. He also turned attention to immigration, warning of an invasion at the southern border. Similar dynamics played out successfully for him in 2016. Tuesday could bring a like victory. Which means Trump's 2018 focus on immigration as a wedge issue could be validated in big states, setting up his 2020 re-election and handing other GOPers a strategy for connecting with the President's base.", "From one direction, Trump faces intense antipathy among young people and minority voters and unusually broad resistance among college-educated white voters, especially women. That threatens Republicans with widespread losses in well-educated, often racially diverse, suburbs in major metropolitan areas around the country, as well as the possible loss of Senate seats in the diverse and growing Southwest states of Nevada, Arizona and possibly (though less likely) Texas.\n\nOn the other side, Trump retains strong support among evangelical, rural and non-college-educated white voters, including women. Trump has energized these voters with a campaign closing argument that appeals to white racial fears and resentments more overtly than any national political figure since George Wallace in the late 1960s.\n\nTrump's efforts are aimed primarily at reinforcing Republican opportunities to oust incumbent Democratic senators in several older, preponderantly white interior states that voted for him in 2016. The high energy among Trump's base is also sustaining long-shot Republican hopes of narrowly holding the House -- or at least minimizing any Democratic majority -- by maintaining the GOP's control of most exurban and blue-collar seats outside the major metropolitan areas.\n\nThe result could be a bifurcated midterm result that simultaneously repudiates Trump while providing him some reaffirmation. While most debate has focused on whether a backlash to Trump will spur a \"wave\" of Democratic gains, today's election seems more likely to solidify and even deepen the stark geographic and demographic divisions that marked Trump's election in 2016. The prospect that turnout will vastly exceed the level in 2014, the most recent midterm election, by perhaps 20 million votes or more, underscores the sense that this campaign may mark a new peak in the partitioning of American society between two political coalitions separated above all by whether they welcome or fear the profound demographic, cultural and economic changes remaking US life.\n\nOn balance, Democrats appear positioned to secure the best results. Beyond the battle for Congress, Democrats are on track for significant gains in governors' races , including in several of the key Rust Belt battlegrounds that keyed Trump's victory. And last-minute polls suggest that if there are surprises in the House and Senate contests, it is more likely to be Democrats prevailing in Trump's terrain than Republicans showing unexpected strength in culturally liberal suburban areas. But the GOP's continued strength among working class and non-urban white voters could allow it to gain Senate seats, and, though much less likely, narrowly defend its House majority.\n\nCoalitions of restoration and transformation\n\nThe election will provide a vivid snapshot of the ongoing polarization of the electorate that Trump has deepened and solidified. Final polling at the national and state level shows Democrats running extremely well among what I've called their \"coalition of transformation\": minorities, millennials and college-educated white voters, especially, but not exclusively, women. All of these groups register intense antipathy for Trump in polls: In the latest CNN survey, conducted by SSRS , Trump's approval rating stood at just 22% among minorities, 32% among young adults and 37% among college-educated whites. That bleak assessment keyed a Democratic advantage in the congressional ballot of 49 percentage points among minorities, 26 points among voters ages 18 to 29 and 22 points among college-educated whites, according to the poll.\n\nOver two-thirds of college-educated white women, an unprecedented number, said they planned to vote Democratic for Congress, according to figures provided by CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. Just over half of college-educated white men also preferred Democrats in the survey. That represents a sharp swing from their usual congressional voting behavior: Democrats haven't won even 40% percent of college-educated white men in any congressional election since 2008, according to exit polls.\n\nBut Trump retains substantial loyalty among the competing Republican \"coalition of restoration\" revolving around older, evangelical, rural and blue-collar whites -- the sorts of voters who dominate the mostly small-town and red-state sites where he has held nonstop rallies in recent days.\n\nIn both the CNN survey, and an ABC/Washington Post survey released Sunday, Trump's approval rating among non-college whites stood at 56%. That represents an erosion from his 2016 vote among them, according to exit polls (67%) but it is still enough to provide Republicans big leads over Democrats with those voters in these surveys. The CNN poll shows non-college whites preferring Republicans for Congress by a 20-percentage-point margin, while the NBC/WSJ survey also released Sunday showed them with a 24-point advantage and the ABC/WP put their lead at 25 points.\n\nIn a mirror image to the well-educated women, nearly two-thirds of white men without a college education said they planned to vote Republican in the CNN poll. Non-college white women also preferred Republicans in the CNN survey, albeit by a much slimmer 53% to 45%; that would be the best showing for Democrats in congressional races since 2006, but might still leave them scrambling to build a winning coalition in House and Senate races dominated by working-class whites.\n\nJUST WATCHED WH officials warn Trump to brace for GOP losses in House Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH officials warn Trump to brace for GOP losses in House 03:45\n\nThe Democratic strength with the \"coalition of transformation\" positions the party for significant gains in suburban districts outside the South where large numbers of ordinarily Republican-leaning college-educated voters dislike or even disdain Trump. This recoil virtually guarantees substantial Republican losses in well-educated House districts the party now holds in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Northern Virginia and Miami in the East; Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City and Minneapolis in the Midwest; and Denver, Tucson, Orange County, California, and probably Seattle in the West. That geography underscores the irony that House Republicans today face their greatest risk in the places that are doing best in the economy -- but where large numbers of voters reject Trump's values and behavior.\n\nFor Republicans to have any chance of preserving their House majority -- or even to hold down a potential Democratic majority to a level that maintains a reasonable chance of the GOP recapturing control in 2020 -- the party needs to minimize its losses beyond those places. The reverse is true too: Unless Democrats can expand beyond the epicenter of Republican vulnerability in the white-collar suburbs outside the South (especially the Republican-held districts that voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016) they will be operating with little margin for error in their drive to recapture 23 seats and the House majority.\n\nRepublicans need a firewall\n\nThat means one key question is whether Republicans can build a firewall around two other groups of districts. One is white-collar suburbs in the South. Traditionally Southern suburbanites have embraced much more conservative positions (especially on social issues) than their counterparts in other regions. But this year Democrats are mounting serious challenges for suburban seats near Raleigh, North Carolina; Atlanta; Houston; Dallas; Tampa, Florida; Charleston, South Carolina; and Richmond, Virginia. Republicans can't afford to lose many of those.\n\nLikewise, the GOP can't afford many losses in blue-collar and exurban districts outside the South that are dominated by the key groups in the \"coalition of restoration.\" Top-tier Democratic targets fitting that description include seats in Maine, upstate New York, northeastern Iowa and central and northwestern Pennsylvania that have drawn increasing attention in the campaign's final turn. One especially revealing group of seats may be those that sit at the intersection of the parties' competing coalitions: places like the districts near Pittsburgh; Seattle; Des Moines, Iowa; Lexington, Kentucky; and Charlotte, North Carolina, that combine suburban with rural populations. The results in those seats will measure the relative enthusiasm of the suburban coalition mobilizing against Trump and the small-town and rural coalition rallying to his defense.\n\nTrump is dividing the country but solidifying his base\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump on racist campaign ad: 'Just telling the truth' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on racist campaign ad: 'Just telling the truth' 01:01\n\nTrump's embrace of such a racially polarizing final message can be interpreted as a form of triage in the House. Almost all Republican consultants agree he is compounding the problems for the GOP incumbents trying to survive in the suburban seats at greatest risk. But he may also be fortifying Republican defenses in the blue-collar, exurban and small-town seats beyond that inner circle of vulnerability. Put another way, Trump's divisive close may be reducing the odds that Democrats win 45 seats in the House -- but at the price of increasing the odds that they win the 23 they need to recapture the majority.\n\nTrump's open appeals to racial anxieties and xenophobia are intended above all to boost Republican prospects against nine Democratic senators seeking re-election in preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar and older interior states that he carried in 2016. (A 10th Democratic senator, Bill Nelson, is seeking re-election in Florida, a much more diverse state that Trump also carried.)\n\nFour of those states across the industrial Rust Belt have essentially moved off the board for Republicans, with Democratic incumbent Sens. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow in Michigan and Bob Casey in Pennsylvania all holding commanding leads. (Democrats also have an opportunity to win the governorship in each of those states, as well as Iowa.)\n\nBut Republicans are considered solid favorites to beat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and have mounted strong challenges to Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Joe Donnelly in Indiana, though late polls give each Democrat reasons for optimism. Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia appears the best positioned of these remaining Trump-state Democrats to survive, but Sen. Jon Tester in Montana remains a wild card amid conflicting polls in the campaign's final days.\n\nIn both the House and Senate, the strong emotions surrounding Trump appear likely to accelerate the transformation of congressional races into quasi-parliamentary contests in which individual assessments of the two candidates are overshadowed by broader judgments about the President and the two parties.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the relationship has grown stronger between how voters grade the sitting president and whether they support his party's candidates in House races. But 2018 may push that trajectory to a new peak. In the past three midterms (2006, 2010 and 2014) between 82% and 84% of voters who disapproved of the president's performance voted against his party's candidates in House races, while 84% to 87% of those who approved voted for them, exit polls found. In the new CNN survey, 91% of Trump approvers said they planned to vote Republican while 92% of disapprovers said they intended to vote Democratic; in the ABC/WP survey the numbers were just under 9 in 10.\n\nRed states and blue states\n\nJUST WATCHED These 2 things could hold back Dems in Arizona Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These 2 things could hold back Dems in Arizona 03:35\n\nBy historic standards, the number of representatives in districts that voted for the other party's presidential candidates is already very low: Just 25 Republicans are in districts that preferred Clinton and only 12 Democrats hold seats in districts that backed Trump. At least two-thirds of the Republicans in Clinton districts are in serious jeopardy today, which means that the number of GOP members from such seats could fall into single digits after the election. Republicans, in turn, have at least some chance of dislodging about one-third of the Democrats in Trump districts, though Democrats today also have opportunities to offset that by capturing over a dozen districts that Trump won. Still, the number of House districts that \"split their ticket\" between the presidential and congressional votes will likely remain very low by historic standards, and could even shrink further.\n\nThe Senate could see the same pattern. Already it's grown much more difficult for senators to win in states that usually vote the other way in presidential elections. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who faces re-election in 2020, for instance, is the only Republican left among the 30 senators elected in the 15 states that have voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992.\n\nThis election could further cull the already diminished ranks of Democratic senators in red-leaning terrain:\n\n13 states have voted Republican in all seven presidential elections since 1992. Democrats hold just two of their 26 Senate seats and are at high risk of losing one of them, Heitkamp's seat in North Dakota. (They could replace that seat if Beto O'Rourke upsets Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas, which has also voted Republican in each of the past seven presidential races.)\n\nDemocrats hold just two of their 26 Senate seats and are at high risk of losing one of them, Heitkamp's seat in North Dakota. (They could replace that seat if Beto O'Rourke upsets Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas, which has also voted Republican in each of the past seven presidential races.) 5 states have voted Republican in six of the past seven presidential elections.

(Phil Bredesen in Tennessee, which has also voted Republican five of seven, could replace one of them.)\n\nDemocrats hold only two of their 12 seats. Manchin and especially McCaskill both face tough races. (Phil Bredesen in Tennessee, which has also voted Republican five of seven, could replace one of them.) 2 states have voted Republican in four of the past seven elections. Democrats hold three of their four Senate seats, but Nelson is in a tough race to hold one of those in Florida.\n\nIn all, Republicans already hold 43 of the 52 Senate seats in the 26 states they have carried in at least four of the seven presidential elections since 1992. If Democrats have a bad night, Republicans could emerge with more than 45 of those seats.\n\nBy contrast, with their Rust Belt recovery, Democrats do not appear at serious risk of losing any the 40 Senate seats they now hold in the 24 states they have won in at least four of the past seven presidential elections. They have a good chance even of adding one, in Nevada, where Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is pressing Republican Sen. Dean Heller.\n\nAll of these dynamics point to the same bracing conclusion: This election is likely to intensify the realignment of the nation into two distinct blocks with inimical visions not only of Trump's belligerent presidency but also of the underlying social, racial and economic changes remaking American life.\n\nAcross the country, Democrats appear on track to consolidate their control of House seats in metropolitan areas that are more diverse, younger, secular and connected to the information age and global economy. (Only the South might resist that pattern.) But they may do little to dent the Republican dominance in non-metro areas that are predominantly white, older, heavily Christian and grounded in traditional industries of manufacturing, energy and agriculture. (The Midwest offers Democrats the best chances to make such inroads.) In the Senate, Democrats could gain ground in younger diverse Sun Belt states (Nevada and/or Arizona, conceivably Texas) and simultaneously lose ground in older, mostly white interior states (North Dakota and the others).\n\nIn both the House and Senate, each party's caucus may be tilted even more than it is today toward one side of this divide.\n\nThe result is that on Wednesday morning, the distance and discord between the coalitions of transformation and restoration may be more vividly apparent than ever. What's less clear is whether America can find any political common ground, or even maintain its social cohesion, as that fault line grows more jagged and volatile.", "Washington (CNN) Exactly 30 days before the election, and the day after she wrapped the the American leg of her Reputation Tour at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Taylor Swift announced on Instagram for the first time ever who she'd be voting for: Democrats Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper.\n\n\"In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions,\" she wrote in the caption, but \"several events in my life and in the world in the past two years\" had changed how she felt, and she encouraged her fans to register and vote themselves.\n\n\"It was surprising in that she's never endorsed a candidate,\" said Beverly Keel, chair of the department of recording industry at Middle Tennessee State University. \"She didn't have to do this.

MUST WATCH She could become America's first black female governor 03:46\n\nA trio of Democratic gubernatorial candidates are each vying to be the first black person to take the governor's mansion in their respective states.", "CNN's live coverage of the 2018 midterm elections has concluded.\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday captured the House of Representatives and are set to exert a major institutional check on President Trump, while breaking the Republican monopoly on power and ushering in a younger, more female and more racially diverse political generation.\n\nBut the GOP solidified their Senate majority after an acerbic midterm election that enshrined America's deep divides and shaped a highly contentious battleground for the stirring 2020 presidential race.\n\nStick with CNN Politics as we sort through the changed political landscape.", "His guest, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, had just predicted with absolute certainty that Democrats would win back the House on election night.\n\n\"We will win,\" she said last week on CBS' \"The Late Show,\" repeating it again three times in a row.\n\nColbert, playfully uncomfortable in his chair, urged her not to say it. \"I feel like I should sacrifice a goat or something to take the hex off,\" he quipped.\n\nAt a time when many in her party feel wary of forecasting a victory -- mindful of Hillary Clinton's unexpected loss in 2016 -- Pelosi isn't holding back.\n\nJust days later in an interview on MSNBC, she declared it again.\n\n\"We will win,\" she said Saturday. \"I say to commentators who are not on the ground or listening to the ground, we will win. So, I'm confident.\"\n\nPelosi isn't, however, making any predictions of just how big a majority Democrats could capture -- a crucial factor in her chances of becoming speaker again. Instead, she's been publicly focused on just getting that \"W,\" even if that means supporting Democrats who are campaigning on a pledge to vote against her.\n\n\"I said to the candidates, 'Just win. This is so important,' \" she said in the MSNBC interview.\n\nBut central to a Democratic majority is the possibility of another Pelosi speakership. Republicans have spent millions trying to tie Democrats in competitive races to the California Democrat and House minority leader, someone they brand as a San Francisco liberal eager to drive the country into oblivion.\n\nOn Monday, while campaigning in Ohio, President Donald Trump invoked Pelosi, the highest-ranking woman in American political history, as part of his closing argument before Election Day.\n\n\"If you don't want to be saying the words 'Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi,' get out and vote for a Republican House,\" he said.\n\nHistoric tenure, strong headwinds\n\nPelosi was the first woman to hold the speaker's gavel when Democrats were last in the minority, from 2007 to 2011. In that position, she helped shepherd through the economic stimulus package, the banking overhaul bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the Affordable Care Act to passage.\n\nSince Democrats went back into the minority in 2011, Pelosi has remained the leader of House Democrats and the most powerful woman in Congress. She largely kept the caucus together, with practically no defections on major votes.\n\nPelosi, who has represented San Francisco for three decades in Congress, is a fundraising juggernaut for House Democrats. This cycle alone she helped raise more than $121 million for her party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nWhile Democratic members laud her leadership, many have said -- some more vocally than others -- in recent months that it is time for a new generation of leaders. And 11 Democratic candidates in toss-up races said openly that they would not support her for speaker.\n\nThat's in part because Republicans have made her their main opponent in ads across the country, attempting to tie any new Democrat closely to her. For Republicans in House and Senate races this year, 17% of ads mentioned Pelosi, costing more than $89.3 million, according to the ad-tracking Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nWhile the ads make news, it's unclear yet just how effective they are in voters' decisions. In August, just 34% of registered voters said in a CNN poll that Pelosi will be an extremely or very important factor in their votes this fall. That ranked dead last of the 10 factors CNN asked about.\n\nStill, Pelosi is facing headwinds from a small but vocal contingent within her party that doesn't want to see her as speaker again. Led by members like Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York, Kurt Schrader of Oregon, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio, they argue that Pelosi hasn't done enough to make room for a younger generation of Democrats.\n\nShe has no challenger yet -- though Ryan is considering a run -- and appears the heavy favorite to win, but the math could get tricky for her if Democrats win by only a slim majority and some continue with their vow to oppose her for speaker.\n\n'Transitional leader'\n\nTo help assuage concerns among the caucus, Pelosi pitched herself before the election as a \"transitional\" leader who would operate as a short-term speaker to help navigate the caucus as it decided its next leaders -- though it was unclear just how long she planned to hold the reins.\n\nShe downplays the Republican ads targeting her as well as intra-party tension over her speakership chances, saying she's not going to shy away from a fight.\n\n\"I feel very confident about the following that I have in the country,\" she also told The Times. \"And if the Republicans want to spend $100 million criticizing me, demonizing me, I must be pretty important.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post published the day before Election Day, Pelosi made her case for speaker.\n\n\"My argument's been about what needs to be done and who's the best person to get it done,\" she said. \"Nobody is indispensable. But I do think that I am best qualified to take us into the future, protect the Affordable Care Act, to do our infrastructure bill and the rest. Stepping down this path, I know the ropes.\"\n\nProtecting the Affordable Care Act has been the key focus of her message, right to the very end. On Monday, Pelosi issued a Dear Colleague letter to her caucus, summing up its work over the past two years, while also looking to the future.\n\nWhile the letter mentions that oversight and accountability will be a key component of a Democratic majority, the No. 1 priority listed is health care. Pelosi pointed to the Democrats' successful messaging efforts last year in helping to prevent the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"With one voice, we affirmed that health care is a right, not a privilege,\" she wrote.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN) --

CNN\n\nSince 2016, the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR) have been bringing together families separated by the US-Mexico border, in an event called Hugs Not Walls. Twice a year, hundreds of families have the chance to see long-lost relatives for an unimaginably short, but precious, period of time: three minutes.\n\nJordyn Rozensky and Justin Hamel\n\n\"It's three minutes to see someone that you haven't seen in a long time. Three minutes to hug, three minutes to cry, and then, at the end of those three minutes, an air horn is blown. And you move back on and the next few people come through,\" explained photographer Jordyn Rozensky.\n\nLast month, Rozensky and her partner Justin Hamel traveled to the border wall that divides Sunland Park from Ciudade Ju\u00e1rez to photograph the most recent Hugs Not Walls event. The much-anticipated gathering usually happens on the dry Rio Grande riverbed, in downtown El Paso, but this time, BNHR had to move the event because of construction to replace the chain-link fence with tall bollard barrier.\n\n\"The new location was even more dramatic, as it began with Border Patrol unlocking a gate in the middle of this massive fence and standing by with rifles throughout the entire Hugs Not Walls event,\" Rozensky said.\n\nJordyn Rozensky and Justin Hamel\n\nMore than 200 immigrant families traveled from both sides of the border to reunite with loved ones. Families on the American side of the border were given blue t-shirts, while those on the Mexican side wore white.\n\nJordyn Rozensky and Justin Hamel\n\n\"We knew that we would be seeing these incredible stories -- these mothers who hadn't seen their own mothers face-to-face in so many years, kids who are meeting their aunts or their uncles or their grandparents for the first time. We knew it would be something that changed the way we saw things, but it definitely was incredibly emotional,\" Rozensky said.\n\nWhile Hugs Not Walls' primary purpose is to facilitate connections among families, coverage of the event attention has helped expose how immigration laws affect real people.\n\n\"It's so important that we continue to think about sensible immigration policies and reform that bring people together and don't hurt families,\" said Rozensky.", "Photographers Jordyn Rozensky and Justin Hamel traveled to downtown El Paso for Hugs not Walls to capture separated families meeting for three minutes at the wall.\n\nSource: CNN", "Written by Jackson Arn, Artsy\n\nThis article was published in partnership with Artsy, the global platform for discovering and collecting art. The original article can be seen here\n\nAs millions of Americans vote in the November midterms, illustrations of donkeys and elephants are bound to show up in political cartoons, campaign buttons, Internet memes, and some truly alarming fashion choices . How could it be otherwise? The two beasts -- the former representing the Democratic Party; the latter, the GOP -- are mainstays of America's visual culture, as recognizable as Santa Claus or Uncle Sam.\n\nYet most Americans would be surprised to learn that both political symbols (as well as Santa Claus and Uncle Sam) were popularized, and given their modern forms, by the same maverick cartoonist.\n\nHis name was Thomas Nast , and over the course of his tenure at Harper's Weekly, from 1862 to 1886, he became America's first great political cartoonist -- and one of its harshest satirists. In the intricately detailed wood engravings for which he's best remembered, he tackled the Civil War, the follies of Reconstruction, immigration, and -- most famously -- the Tammany Hall political machine. Some have suggested that the word \"nasty\" derives from the artist's surname, and while this is almost certainly not true, one glance at his cartoons might convince you that it is.\n\nFamilies allowed hug on the US-Mexico border\n\nHistorians have asserted that Nast, who grew up in New York City in the 1840s and '50s, was ferociously bullied as a child. Indeed, the two themes that run through his career are his sneering disdain for bullies of all shapes and sizes, and his compassion for their victims.\n\nThis political cartoon by Thomas Nast, taken from a 1879 edition of Harper's Weekly, was an early use of the elephant and the donkey to sybolize the Republican and Democratic parties. Credit: Kean Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nAt Harper's, he moved back and forth between these two poles. In one famous cartoon, \"Worse Than Slavery\" (1874), a defenseless black family cowers before a grinning Klansman; in another -- a blistering parody of the KKK's alliance with New York's political machine, captioned \"They Are Swallowing Each Other\" -- there are no victims, only two bloated, bug-eyed men depicted as ouroboroi. Nowadays, \"editorial cartoons\" might bring to mind spare, deliberately simplistic images -- the kind you can process in half a second while reading the news. By contrast, Nast's dense, meticulously labeled cartoons were news: not just images but arguments, meant to be analyzed and discussed point-by-point.\n\nTake \"Third Term Panic,\" the 1874 cartoon often credited with popularizing the elephant as a symbol for the Republican Party. In the months leading up to the midterms, the New York Herald, at the time backing several Democratic candidates, had spread the rumor that President Ulysses Grant, a Republican, was contemplating running for a third term in 1876\u2014not illegal in the days before the 22nd Amendment, but definitely frowned upon.\n\nIn this politcal cartoon by Thomas Nast, titled \"Fine-Ass Committee,\" a donkey stands in for a Democratic congressmen blowing financial bubbles. Credit: Kean Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nNast, a proud supporter of the Party of Lincoln, drew the Herald as a donkey wrapped in a lion's skin, frightening the other animals with wild stories of a Grant dictatorship. Among these animals are an enormous, oafish elephant labeled \"the Republican Vote,\" which looks as though it's about to tumble off a cliff.\n\nNast was hardly the first humorist to compare humans to animals -- the story of the donkey in the lion's skin goes back all the way to Aesop. He wasn't even the first artist to compare Republicans to pachyderms: At least a decade earlier, advertisements had promoted the GOP with the slogan \"see the elephant,\" an obscure bit of Civil War slang that roughly translates to \"fight bravely.\"\n\nAnd while Nast depicted the Democratic Party as a donkey many times (though in \"Third Term Panic\" it actually takes the shape of a fox), the two had been linked since the days of the Jackson administration half a century ago.\n\nThe Republican elephant made its first appearance in this 1874 cartoon by Thomas Nast. A fox in the bottom right corner represents the Democratic party. Credit: Kean Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nBut it was Nast's insight to present American politics as one big, messy menagerie -- a circus, much like the one Barnum & Bailey had debuted in New York three years earlier. Like the best satirists, he ridiculed his own side almost as gleefully as he did his opponents' -- and so, he reimagined the GOP as a weak, panicky creature that was constantly lumbering off in the wrong direction, its size more of a liability than an asset.\n\nNast's donkeys fare no better; a typical cartoon from 1879 shows the stubborn beast dangling by the tail, about to fall into an abyss of \"financial chaos.\" More often than not, in fact, his cartoons depict elephants and donkeys only a hair's breadth away from chaos -- a pretty fair assessment of Republican and Democratic leadership during the Gilded Age.\n\nIn the 1880s, Nast was the most feared artist in the country, the sworn enemy of crooks and swindlers on the right and the left alike. Then, in a Nast-y twist of fate worthy of his cartoons, he lost all his money in a Ponzi scheme, the kind of sleazy operation he'd spent his entire career cautioning against. In 1890, he tried to rebuild his fortune by publishing a book of Christmas illustrations.\n\nIn this 1876 Nast cartoon, the Republican vote, represented by Uncle Sam riding an elephant, tramples a tiger representing the Democrats. Credit: Kean Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nBy that point, however, he seems to have lost some of the creative momentum he'd gained at Harper's, and he spent the last decade of his life in poor health, painfully aware that his best work was long behind him.\n\nBut the elephant and the donkey live on in political pageantry, thanks to Nast's ingenuity. To date, the elephant remains the official symbol of the Republican Party, and although the Democrats have yet to declare their own, you wouldn't need to walk more than a couple paces at one of their rallies before spotting a donkey.\n\nIt's a little weird that both of the major American political parties have embraced their mascots so enthusiastically, considering how poorly the two animals come across in Nast's original cartoons: how stupid, how pliable, how easily confused. Maybe neither party bothered to check before stocking up on pins and tote bags.\n\nOr maybe they knew about Nast's mockery and decided that the appropriate response was to join in mocking themselves.", "New Delhi (CNN Business) 1. Election Day: Americans go to the polls on Tuesday to vote in midterm elections, with potential implications for President Donald Trump's tax policies and the stock market.\n\nSome experts have blamed the recent market volatility , in part, on expectations that Democrats might take control of the House of Representatives. If that happens, they could dial back President Trump's signature tax cuts, or, at the very least, not extend the cuts for individuals that are set to expire in 2025.\n\nA split decision that leaves the Republican Senate majority intactwould likely maintain the status quo in terms of fiscal, trade and regulatory policies. But analysts at Barclays have warned that Democrats taking control of both the House and Senate would have a \"negative\" impact on the stock market.\n\nWithout tax cuts and deregulation to look forward to, investor sentiment would be hurt by calls for impeachment and investigations, they argue.\n\nFacebook ( FB ), meanwhile, is stepping up its efforts to rein in misinformation around the election after warnings from the FBI about potential Russian meddling.

Pero ahora la pareja trabajadora enfrenta una crisis de salud y los comensales les est\u00e1n devolviendo lo bueno que han recibido de ellos.\n\nDesde que Stella sufri\u00f3 un aneurisma cerebral el mes pasado, John ha tratado de pasar con ella tanto tiempo como ha podido.\n\n\"Ella est\u00e1 en un hogar de ancianos\", dijo Chhan. \"Mi cu\u00f1ada est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed ayud\u00e1ndome.\n\nCon un negocio que llevar y cuentas que pagar, las rosquillas todav\u00eda tienen que salir del horno. Chhan pens\u00f3 que tendr\u00eda que pasar la mayor parte de su tiempo trabajando en el local, lejos de su esposa.\n\nPero cuando los clientes supieron de la situaci\u00f3n de los Chhan, abrieron de par en par sus corazones... y sus bocas.\n\nHora de comprar rosquillas\n\nCada ma\u00f1ana, a partir de las 4:30, los clientes llegan al local y compran todas las rosquillas. Beben todo el caf\u00e9 mientras dejan su dinero y su amor.\n\nHacia las 7:30, los contenedores est\u00e1n vac\u00edos y el coraz\u00f3n de Chhan est\u00e1 lleno.\n\n\"Rompe el coraz\u00f3n escuchar sobre su desgracia\", dijo Steven O'Fallon, un cliente habitual, sobre la mujer que le ha preparado rosquillas durante toda su vida. \"Ella siempre estaba en el fondo preparando rosquillas\".\n\n\"Yo pasaba por ah\u00ed con mi mam\u00e1 y mi pap\u00e1 en las ma\u00f1anas antes de ir a la escuela. John siempre pon\u00eda unos agujeros de rosquilla adicionales. \u00c9l siempre ten\u00eda una sonrisa en su rostro\".\n\nO'Fallon y los otros clientes dicen que simplemente est\u00e1n devolviendo la alegr\u00eda que los Chhan les dieron durante d\u00e9cadas.\n\n\"Cada domingo durante 20 a\u00f1os hemos comprado rosquillas\", dijo Jenee Rogers, otra antigua clienta. \"Es una de las pocas cosas que siguen aqu\u00ed. \u00c9l las prepara frescas y y las lleva ah\u00ed en las ma\u00f1anas. Es el verdadero sue\u00f1o americano para ellos\".\n\nLos Chhan han trabajado duro por su sue\u00f1o y pidieron espec\u00edficamente que no se abrieran sitios de microfinanciaci\u00f3n colectiva (crowdfunding) en su nombre. As\u00ed que los clientes decidieron hacer los que siempre hab\u00edan hecho, solo que un poco m\u00e1s temprano: ir a la tienda de los Chhan, comprar las rosquillas y difundir la dulzura.\n\n\"Estoy

research has revealed, undermining China's denial of the existence of mass internment camps.\n\nUp to a million ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have reportedly been detained in the past year inside enormous \"re-education camps\" in the tightly-controlled province, where former detainees say they were forced to endure intensive \"brainwashing\" sessions.\n\nThe claims, which have been made by activists for months, were confirmed as \"broadly accurate\" by the UK government in October.\n\nAfter initially denying the reports vehemently at the United Nations, China later changed its story without explanation to claim the camps were \"vocational training centers\" , and the \"students\" were happy to be there and free to leave on completing their courses.\n\nBut the report released by the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis institute on Monday, revealed that spending on security-related construction in Xinjiang rose by nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion), or 213%, between 2016 and 2017.\n\nAccording to local budget documents analyzed by the report, expenditure on total domestic security surged by 92% in the one year period, which included a 239% increase in spending for \"detention center management\" and 118% increase in spending for the \"justice system.\"\n\nIn fact the report found that vocational spending in Xinjiang dropped by 2017, falling 7% in total.\n\nThe largest jump was categorized under the vague definition of \"other domestic security expenditure,\" which skyrocketed between 2016 and 2017 by 351%.\n\n\"These facts do not support the notion of a large campaign to improve vocational skills,\" report author Adrian Zenz wrote in his conclusion.\n\n\"Rather, the mass disappearances of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, beginning in early 2017, almost certainly resulted in their imprisonment in de facto political re-education institutions administered by public security or justice system authorities.\"\n\nThis photo taken on February 27, 2017 shows Chinese military police attending an anti-terrorist oath-taking rally in Hetian, northwest China's Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.\n\nActivists accuse Beijing of attempting to eradicate the Uyghur culture and way of life over the past year through harsh new measures, passing regulations banning face coverings and long beards as well as mandating house visits by Communist Party officials.\n\nThe Chinese government has been working hard in the past month to deflect criticism of its detention centers in Xinjiang, which it quietly legalized for the first time in early October.\n\nIn a lengthy interview with state-run Xinhua news agency published on October 16, Xinjiang Governor Shohrat Zakir, himself an ethnic Uyghur, said the Chinese government was fighting \"terrorism and extremism\" in its own way, and in accordance with United Nations resolutions.\n\n\"Today's Xinjiang is not only beautiful but also safe and stable. No matter where they are or at what time of the day, people are no longer afraid of going out, shopping, dining and traveling,\" he told Xinhua\n\nThe official added there was \"still a long way to go\" in some parts of the province to eradicate \"extremism.\"\n\nAt the same time, state broadcaster CCTV released a documentary ostensibly showing excerpts of life inside the camps, including inmates learning vocational skills and enjoying outdoor activities.\n\n\"I can't imagine the outcome if I hadn't come here to study,\" one interviewee told CCTV. \"I may follow those religious extremists and step on the path of committing crimes. The Party and the government discovered me and saved me.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nTambi\u00e9n es Heimdall, compa\u00f1ero de batalla de Thor en el mundo de las pel\u00edculas de superh\u00e9roes de Marvel\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Su nombre ya suena para ser el primer James Bond negro en la historia de la franquicia del 007.

Sayoc's preliminary hearing was originally scheduled for Monday, but as courts are closed on Veteran's Day, his hearing has been rescheduled for Tuesday morning.\n\nIn a letter, prosecutors had said they were asking that Sayoc be held without bond, based on his flight risk and the danger they said he posed to the community.\n\nSayoc, who spent Monday night at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan after a charter transport flight from Florida, entered the courtroom wearing a navy blue prison uniform with a beige T-shirt underneath. He did not wear handcuffs or shackles.\n\nCesar Sayoc is accused of sending at least 16 mail bombs to several targets.\n\nHe conferred with public defender Sarah Jane Baumgartel, who sat next to him, and answered the judge's questions. Lehrburger officially appointed Baumgartel as his counsel.\n\nAfter the appearance, Sayoc and Baumgartel embraced before law enforcement officers led Sayoc out of the courtroom.\n\nThe 56-year-old faces five federal charges: interstate transportation of an explosive, illegal mailing of explosives, threats against former presidents and other persons, threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers.\n\nSayoc is accused of sending at least 16 mail bombs to several targets, including CNN, former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. None of the devices detonated, and no one was injured. He was arrested October 26 in Florida.\n\nDaniel Aaronson, the attorney who represented him during proceedings in Florida, has said his client intended to plead not guilty to the crimes.\n\n\"Nobody has been able in a court of law to say that those were bombs that he sent,\" Aaronson said. \"Therefore, there is no reason why he should speak or possibly have any information to impart.\"\n\nA federal judge in Miami ruled last week that he be transferred to face charges in New York, where some of the targets of the packages lived and worked.\n\n2 more devices recovered since arrest, prosecutors say\n\nIf convicted, Sayoc could receive up to 48 years in prison.\n\nJUST WATCHED Video shows suspect at 2017 Trump rally Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video shows suspect at 2017 Trump rally 01:22\n\nSince his arrest last month, authorities have recovered two more packages containing explosive devices.\n\nThe latest package was found Friday, federal prosecutors said in the letter to Lehrburger. The device was in a package addressed to Democratic donor and billionaire Thomas Steyer, in California, prosecutors said. It was the second package Sayoc allegedly mailed to Steyer.\n\n\"The defendant used mailing materials nearly identical to the other 15 packages, including the same type of envelope, address format, and stamps,\" the prosecutors' letter reads.\n\nOn Monday, Sayoc's mother wrote an open letter to ABC in which she warned politicians that fiery rhetoric targeting politicians and journalists resonated with the mentally ill, spurring them to \"violently act out in our country.\"\n\nMadeline Sayoc said her estranged son was mentally ill and that his family tried to get him help over the years, to no avail. She called for stronger laws that would allow American families to \"compel and require\" treatment for their loved ones when necessary.\n\nFBI finds target list, package labels\n\nSayoc was arrested at an AutoZone parking lot in Plantation, Florida, as he neared his white Dodge van, which was plastered with pro-Trump and anti-Democrat memes\n\nAuthorities have called the pipe bombs a \" domestic terrorist attack .\"\n\nA letter sent to the judge presiding over Sayoc's case in Florida suggests investigators believe he had planned to continue his alleged attacks.\n\n\"Put simply, only the defendant's arrest and incapacitation resulting from his detention were sufficient to stop his attack,\" US Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the Southern District of New York wrote.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'You never know where people come from in life' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'You never know where people come from in life' 11:06\n\nSearches into Sayoc's laptop and cell phone showed he had been doing research online about the homes and families of the recipients of the packages.

They include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Most individuals recover without treatment. In some patients the diarrhea can be so severe that hospitalization and antibiotic treatment are required to prevent the illness from spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and elsewhere in the body.\n\nConagra noted that some of the sick individuals could have eaten the mix raw rather than cooked. \"Consumers are reminded not to consume any raw batter. Cake mixes and batter can be made with ingredients such as eggs or flour which can carry risks of bacteria that are rendered harmless by baking, frying or boiling,\" the Conagra statement said.\n\n\"While it has not been definitively concluded that this product is linked to the outbreak and the investigation is still ongoing, Conagra has decided to voluntarily recall the specific Duncan Hines variety identified (Classic White) and three other varieties (Classic Butter Golden, Signature Confetti and Classic Yellow) made during the same time period out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said.\n\nThe recalled cake mixes were distributed nationwide and to some international exporters.

Loeb has published four books and more than 700 papers on topics like black holes, the future of the universe, the search for extraterrestrial life and the first stars.\n\nThe paper points out that comparable light-sails exist on Earth.\n\n\"Light-sails with similar dimensions have been designed and constructed by our own civilization, including the IKAROS project and the Starshot Initiative. The light-sail technology might be abundantly used for transportation of cargos between planets or between stars.\"\n\nIn the paper, the pair theorize that the object's high speed and its unusual trajectory could be the result of it no longer being operational.\n\n\"This would account for the various anomalies of 'Oumuamua, such as the unusual geometry inferred from its light-curve, its low thermal emission, suggesting high reflectivity, and its deviation from a Keplerian orbit without any sign of a cometary tail or spin-up torques.\"\n\n'Oumuamua is the first object ever seen in our solar system that is known to have originated elsewhere.\n\nAt first, astronomers thought the rapidly moving faint light was a regular comet or an asteroid that had originated in our solar system.\n\nComets, in particular, are known to speed up due to \"outgassing,\" a process in which the sun heats the surface of the icy comet, releasing melted gas. But 'Oumuamua didn't have a \"coma,\" the atmosphere and dust that surrounds comets as they melt.\n\nMultiple telescopes focused on the object for three nights to determine what it was before it moved out of sight.\n\nGoing forward, the researchers believe we should search for other interstellar objects in our sky.\n\n\"It is exciting to live at a time when we have the scientific technology to search for evidence of alien civilizations,\" Loeb wrote in an email. \"The evidence about `Oumuamua is not conclusive but interesting. I will be truly excited once we have conclusive evidence.\"\n\nIs this just fantasy?\n\nOther mysteries in space have previously been thought of as signs of extraterrestrial life: a mysterious radio signal, repeating fast radio bursts and even a strangely flickering star, known as Tabby's Star.\n\nSo what does that mean for 'Oumuamua?\n\n\"I am distinctly unconvinced and honestly think the study is rather flawed,\" Alan Jackson, fellow at the Centre for Planetary Sciences at the University of Toronto Scarborough, wrote in an email. \"Carl Sagan once said, 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence' and this paper is distinctly lacking in evidence nevermind extraordinary evidence.\"\n\nJackson published a paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in March that suggests that 'Oumuamua came from a binary star system, or a system with two stars.\n\nJackson said the spectral data from 'Oumuamua looks like an asteroid or a comet, while that of a solar sail would look very different. The new paper proposes that the sail has been coated in interstellar dust, which obscures its true spectral signature.\n\n\"Any functional spacecraft would almost certainly retract its solar sail once in interstellar space to prevent damage,\" Jackson said. \"The sail is useless once away from a star so there would be no reason to leave it deployed. If it was then deployed again on entering the solar system it would be pristine. Even if it was left deployed the dust accumulation would be primarily on the leading side like bugs on a windshield.\"\n\n'Oumuamua also travels in a complex tumbling spin, but a functioning solar sail would have a much smoother path and obvious radiation-driven acceleration, Jackson said. Even the spinning motion of a damaged solar sail would be far more strongly influenced by the radiation forces than seen, he explained.\n\nThe solar sail would also be thinner than the authors of the new paper describe, he said.\n\n\"The sail on IKAROS is 7.5 micrometres thick with a mass of only 0.001g/cm^2, 100 times lower than their estimate,\" Jackson said. \"While a combined spacecraft and sail could have a higher net mass the sail itself needs to be extremely light. That would also significantly change their estimate for how far it could travel before falling apart -- though as I said, I doubt any functional craft would leave its sail deployed in interstellar space.\"\n\nSolar sails also can't change course after being launched, so if 'Oumuamua was truly a solar sail, it would be traceable back to its origin. So far, there is no obvious origin for 'Oumuamua.\n\n\"Beyond that, it becomes difficult to trace because of the motion of the stars and any hypothetical alien civilisation would face the same issue in charting a course that long in the first place (aside from arguments about whether they would want to launch a craft they knew would not reach its destination for many millions of years),\" Jackson said.\n\nConcerning 'Oumuamua, there is little evidence because astronomers weren't able to observe it for long, which opens it up to speculation in the name of science.\n\n\"The thing you have to understand is: scientists are perfectly happy to publish an outlandish idea if it has even the tiniest 'sliver' of a chance of not being wrong,\" astrophysicist and cosmologist Katherine Mack tweeted. \"But until every other possibility has been exhausted dozen times over, even the authors probably don't believe it.\"\n\nThe thing you have to understand is: scientists are perfectly happy to publish an outlandish idea if it has even the tiniest *sliver* of a chance of not being wrong. But until every other possibility has been exhausted dozen times over, even the authors probably don't believe it. \u2014 Katie Mack (@AstroKatie) November 6, 2018\n\nBut it's important to distinguish that the researchers who wrote the new paper have expertise in solar sails, so they're suggesting that 'Oumuamua could be like a solar sail, said Coryn Bailer-Jones of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. Bailer-Jones' paper on possible origin sites for 'Oumuamua was accepted by the Astrophysical Journal in September.\n\n\"Aliens would only come into all of this if you accept their assumption (and that's what it is; it doesn't come from the data) that 'Oumuamua is sail-like, and also assume nothing like that can be natural,\" Bailer-Jones wrote in an email. \"In fact, they only mention the word 'alien' once, when they mention in passing that 'Oumuamua might have been targeted to intercept the solar system.\n\n\"I have no problem with this kind of speculative study,\" Bailer-Jones added. \"It's fun and thought-provoking, and the issue of whether there is alien life out there is really important. But the paper doesn't give any evidence for aliens (and the authors don't claim that, I should note.)\"", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Thank you to all!\" he tweeted.\n\nMore reaction is sure to come from Trump as he is scheduled to hold a news conference at 11:30 a.m. ET in the East Room of the White House.\n\nBut the new Democratic House will pose a perilous problem for the President, who must now brace for the novel experience of oversight from Capitol Hill with Democratic committee chairs promising constraints on his power that the GOP never attempted.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who is in position to lead again, pledged that the new majority would work to rein in the White House as well as to improve health care, lower the cost of drugs and protect millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans. It is about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration,\" Pelosi said.\n\nDemocrats could win more than 30 seats in the House, above the net gain of 23 seats that they needed to take control for the first time in eight years. But they lost significant ground in the Senate, losing incumbents in Missouri and Indiana and North Dakota, where Trump is still wildly popular. With several races too close to call, the GOP advantage was expected to grow.\n\nAnd liberal hearts were broken in several closely fought marquee races, including Andrew Gillum's failure to become Florida's first African-American governor and rising star Beto O'Rourke's failed bid to unseat Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. O'Rourke's narrow defeat, however, proved his ability to compete even in conservative territory and he will get buzz as a potential 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nDemocrats dare to dream again\n\nTwo years after the trauma of Trump's shock defeat of Hillary Clinton, Democrats could dare to dream again.\n\nThey won the House, which will change hands for the third time in 12 volatile years, by performing strongly in suburban areas where Trump's flaming rhetoric is toxic. They also attracted a higher proportion of younger voters than at the last midterm elections four years ago and will change the face of Washington.\n\n\"We have the beginning of a new Democratic Party, younger, browner, cooler, more women, more veterans, can win in Michigan, can win in Pennsylvania, can win in Ohio,\" said Van Jones, a CNN political commentator.\n\n\"It may not be a blue wave, it's a rainbow wave,\" he said.\n\nOne potential pitfall for Democrats will be to hold Trump to account without being seen as overreaching. After all, some presidents, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, had tough midterm elections but leveraged attacks by Capitol Hill foes to help them win re-election. Trump, who loves nothing more than to identify new enemies, will be a formidable opponent.\n\nWithin minutes of their victory being confirmed, other Democrats were already threatening to go after Trump and to probe his business interests, including his tax returns.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who is slated to steer the House Judiciary Committee, warned that the election was about accountability for Trump.\n\n\"He's going to learn that he's not above the law,\" Nadler told CNN.\n\nThe race they ran\n\nThe contradictory message sent by voters on Tuesday night recalls Clinton's win in the popular vote but defeat in the Electoral College and underlines the split down the middle of American politics.\n\nRepublicans performed strongly in the deep red states where Trump mounted a frenetic final campaign blitz and proved that despite his low approval rating he remains a potent political force among conservatives.\n\nIn nearly every state with a key contested Senate or governor's race, the President had a positive approval rating over 50%, according to CNN's preliminary exit poll data.\n\nKeeping hold of the Senate is especially important for Trump, since it will allow him and Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell to press on with one of his major legacy-building initiatives, restocking the federal judiciary with conservatives.\n\nTuesday's Senate victory marks another triumph for the canny Kentuckian, follow his piloting of Trump's two nominees onto the Supreme Court to construct what could be a generational conservative majority.\n\nStill, Trump will also have to answer for a scorched-earth campaign on immigration in the final days that might have helped tip the House to Democrats, even if he can argue that his magnetism helped push other candidates, such as Rep. Ron DeSantis, who won the Florida gubernatorial race, across the finish line.\n\nOther Trump favorites include Marsha Blackburn, who will capture the Tennessee Senate race, and Mike Braun, who defeated the incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana. Trump also helped topple another foe, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri.\n\nThe loss of the House spells the end of a political era for Republicans who rode into town on a Tea Party wave whipped up by fury over Obamacare and huge government spending in the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe Republican majority will leave town with Obamacare still the law of the land and with a deficit going through the roof on the back of GOP tax cuts.\n\nIn theory, the new Democratic majority would have the capacity to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump, should there be sufficient grounds uncovered in Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation. Though the Republican gains in the Senate make it even less likely that there would be a two-thirds majority needed to convict a president and evict him from office.\n\nBut if they take a cautious approach, Democrats could face a backlash from their own base voters who have been electrified in opposition to Trump. In exit polls, 77% of self-identified Democrats supported impeachment.\n\nWhat is next for Trump?\n\nMuch will depend on how Trump reacts to what is undeniable a rebuke from voters two years into a presidency that has unfolded in institutional chaos, torn at racial and cultural divides and often trampled on truth and facts.\n\nGiven his history and personality, it seems unlikely the President will reflect on the cultural warfare that he waged in the dying days of the campaign and change his approach. Indeed, he may conclude that exactly that kind of approach was behind a better-than-expected GOP performance in Senate races.\n\nBut critics will argue that his incessant concern with bolstering the support of his most vehement supporters and angry tirades risks deepening the damage suffered among college-educated female voters especially, in a way that could severely compromise his hopes of winning re-election in two years.\n\nThe President watched the results after having dinner with his family in the residence of the White House.\n\nHe was joined by Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman and the President's ex-campaign aides, David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski, a source familiar with the guest list said.\n\nTwo other sources close to the White House said that Trump is already blaming retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan for the loss of the House.\n\n\"He is really angry at Ryan,\" one source said, on \"everything.\"\n\nDrew Hammill, an aide to Pelosi, tweeted Tuesday evening that the President called Pelosi at 11:45 p.m. ET \"to extend his congratulations on winning a Democratic House Majority.\"", "\u062a\u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0641\u0631\u0636\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u0642\u0641 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0635\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u063a\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649\u060c \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0645\u0646\u062d\u062a \u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0639\u0641\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a \u0644\u062a\u0648\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0637\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0634\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f \u0648\u0625\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0643\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0627\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0627\u060c \u0644\u0625\u0639\u0637\u0627\u0621 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u062b\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0625\u0645\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0627\u062a \u0628\u062f\u064a\u0644\u0629.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 06 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "(CNN) Lewis Bennett and his wife Isabella Hellman had just welcomed a new daughter when they set sail last April with the intention of sailing from St. Maarten to Florida on a catamaran named \"Surf Into Summer.\"\n\nBennett was the captain, a skilled swimmer and sailor. His wife was a weak swimmer with less sailing experience, according to court papers. Unlike her husband, she wasn't trained on how to handle emergencies, prosecutors say.\n\nBut two weeks into the trip, there was an emergency after they left Cuba. Bennett reported his wife missing in a distress call to the Coast Guard, who rescued him from a life raft about 30 miles west of Cay Sal, Bahamas, not far from Cuba in May 2017. Hellman's body was never found.\n\nOn Monday, the 41-year-old Bennett, who is a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of his wife. The plea deal was struck after prosecutors originally sought a second-degree murder charge against Bennett, who was set to go to trial in December.\n\nBennett's attorney, Edward Downey, declined to comment on Monday.\n\nHellman's death resulted in part from her husband's \"gross negligence, amounting to wanton and reckless disregard for human life,\" prosecutors said.\n\nHe did not require that his wife wear a life vest or harness despite her inexperience, nor did he deploy flares or turn the boat around to search for her when he couldn't find the 41-year-old real estate agent from Delray Beach, Florida, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Lewis Bennett will now be held accountable for his wife's death while on the high seas,\" Tom Jones, acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Miami office said in a news release.\n\nBennett 'did not deploy flares,' prosecutors say\n\nEarly on May 15, 2017, a loud noise woke Bennett, who had asked his wife to take over the night watch, prosecutors said. Bennett noticed the sails and rigging were loose, and saw his wife wasn't at the controls, prosecutors said.\n\nBennett \"could not recall whether\" he called out his wife's name, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Although Mr. Bennett threw a horseshoe life ring overboard, he did not deploy flares to illuminate the area to look for his wife or to signal his position, nor did he turn the catamaran around to look for her,\" prosecutors said.\n\nNeither did Bennett immediately activate a personal locator beacon or use a satellite phone to signal or call for help for Hellman, prosecutors said.\n\nHe tossed several items in his life raft, including a suitcase, two duffel bags, water, food and silver coins, and then abandoned the catamaran, prosecutors said. Bennett estimated that about 45 minutes to an hour had elapsed from the time he woke up until he abandoned the catamaran, prosecutors said.\n\nBennett made mayday calls with the catamaran's radio, but they were unsuccessful, prosecutors said.\n\nAboard the life raft, he used a satellite phone and activated a small battery-powered transmitting device to call for help and report his wife missing, prosecutors said.\n\nBennett also didn't discharge flares during the hours he lay waiting for the Coast Guard to rescue him, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Although he initially attempted to paddle the life raft to look for his wife, the life raft was hard to control, and he was scared to lean out to use the paddle, so abandoned his efforts,\" prosecutors said.\n\nThe Coast Guard searched for Hellman for three days before suspending the search.\n\nBennett told authorities at the time that the boat hit something while he was asleep, and the vessel began taking on water.\n\nIn February, authorities charged Bennett with second-degree murder. An FBI agent wrote in an affidavit then he believed Bennett intentionally scuttled the boat.\n\nPhotographs and video of the capsized vessel appeared to show that a small part of each hull -- the part of the ship that goes underwater -- was breached, and the damage to the hull came from the inside of the vessel, the affidavit said\n\nA Naval expert concluded that \"the holes in the hull under the forward hatches are unexplainable as structural failures due to the working of the vessel or as a result of a collision ... I cannot think of any items that would accidentally cause similar holes in both hulls at roughly the same time,\" according to the affidavit.\n\nWhen asked by the FBI what he did to find Hellman, Bennett \"indicated he did not do anything\" like call out for her or use flares to illuminate the water, the affidavit said. Bennett told other agencies he yelled out for his wife and threw out a buoy, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe 'pain is unbearable,' victim's family says\n\nBennett was sentenced in February to seven months in federal prison for transporting stolen gold and silver coins on the same trip. He faces up to eight years after his plea of involuntary manslaughter when he is sentenced on January 10.\n\nIn a family statement, obtained by CNN affiliate WPTV , Hellman family attorney Joel Weissman said his clients' \"hearts are broken.\"\n\n\"Although they already knew, they now have confirmation, that their beloved daughter and sister, Isabella, was never coming back to us, we now have confirmation that she was taken from us by her husband, Lewis Bennett. The pain he has caused them is unbearable and never goes away,\" the statement said.", "(CNN) Why did the salmon cross the road?\n\nSimple. To have babies, at least according to Alexis Leonard, a fish hatchery specialist who recorded the video of more than a dozen salmon swimming across a flooded US Highway 101 in Shelton, Washington, on Saturday.\n\nLeonard and her father were headed back to Eells Springs Trout Hatchery when they came across the first salmon.\n\n\"We kind of saw one fish dart across the road,\" she said. Leonard recorded the video for her sister, who had never seen fish swimming across a road, and also posted it on Facebook. The video quickly went viral. As of Tuesday afternoon, it had more than 6,300 views.\n\nThis isn't an unusual occurrence in Washington, Leonard said. Salmon in the area typically come from the Skokomish River and inhabit the creeks in order to spawn, or have babies. When there's heavy rain, Leonard said, the creeks flood, sending the fish everywhere.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

partnership with CNN.\n\nKandahar, Afghanistan (CNN) As the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq evolved, military doctors grappling to treat soldiers maimed by roadside bombs began facing another challenge: Their patients were developing almost incurable, multidrug-resistant infections in their wounds. They couldn't be treated with the usual antibiotics the doctors had on hand.\n\nUS Army Col. Clinton Murray, 48, an infectious-diseases doctor, was deployed to the region four times between 2003 and 2015, working in military hospitals and clinics across the country.\n\nHe said that drug-resistant or \"superbug\" infections meant some soldiers had problems for years after their initial life-altering injuries. When common antibiotics failed, higher doses of antibiotics, new drug combinations or alternative drugs with severe side effects were tried, but many had repeat and prolonged infections. Others had to undergo extra surgeries or amputations to stop the bacteria from spreading further.\n\nThe US Army soon realized that drug resistance was a serious problem and, from 2009, introduced programs to reduce drug resistance in its military hospitals -- but the problem was just as bad, if not worse, in nearby civilian hospitals.\n\nWhen things got really bad for the Army, soldiers were evacuated to two US hospitals. One was Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas, where Murray also ran the infectious-diseases department.\n\nCivilians, however, had fewer resources and no way out.\n\nAfghan citizens are dying because of the war, and drug resistance will mean even more deaths, said Dr. Nasimullah Bawar, head of health programme at BRAC Afghanistan , a nongovernmental organization providing drugs and maternity, child health, immunization, nutrition, mental health and malaria and TB-control services in four provinces.\n\nBawar compares superbugs to another scourge, the Islamic State or Daesh, because it will disrupt the country and kill many citizens: \"This is going to be another Daesh, I can say.\"\n\nMaking the situation even tougher is 40 years of conflict.\n\nA military struggle against 'Iraqibacter'\n\nMilitary doctors started noticing an influx of patients with multidrug-resistant infections from 2003, two years after the Afghanistan war started, but it was years before the Army identified the scope of the problem.\n\nInfections from a resistant form of one type of bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, became so common in Iraq and then Afghanistan that the soldiers gave it a nickname: \"Iraqibacter.\" The bug had usually been a problem in older or very sick patients who had spent months in the hospital, but doctors were now seeing it in young, fit soldiers, commonly in blast wounds.\n\nAt the peak of the problem, between 2004 and 2006, the budget for one class of last-resort antibiotics called carbapenems, used for severe and multidrug-resistant infections, went up more than 400%.\n\nThe use of another drug, colistin, called the \"last hope\" drug because of its use on critically ill patients, became so common that the Army had to restrict it.\n\nSomething had to change.\n\nTargeted control programs were introduced in 2009 and included guidelines on antibiotic use, better surveillance of drug resistance, improved record-keeping and better infection control. Resistance was reduced to pre-war levels within six years.\n\n\"I have folks I've been following for 10 to 15 years,\" Murray said. \"First couple of years, we wrestled with infection. Then, for the next 11, they've done great. They live functional lives.\"\n\nSpecialist care meant soldiers were being saved from superbug infections.\n\nMurray recalls one patient who lost both his legs after being hit by a roadside bomb in Iraq. Three weeks after the blast, after evacuation to the US, infections developed in his stumps.\n\nDoctors swabbed the wounds and found a plethora of dangerous organisms, including three types of multidrug-resistant bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as Staphylococcus aureus. To stem these infections, they had to give him antibiotics that caused kidney failure, though his organs recovered after the drug therapy was stopped a few days later.\n\nBut the patient went on to develop more infections.\n\nOn one occasion, the antibiotics poisoned his bone marrow, which affects the body's immunity and clotting. He was given a different antibiotic that cleared the infection in that stump, and fortunately, the poisoning did not turn out to be permanent. However, he soon developed an infection in his other stump.\n\nDoctors suggested more surgery to cut away the infected part of his leg, but he opted instead to take antibiotics long-term to quash the infection.\n\nNow, 12 years after being hit, he still has to take antibiotics to keep the infection at bay, but he lives a normal life with prosthetic legs. \"His kids and my kids knew each other, and now they're in college and doing great,\" Murray said.\n\nBut the gains made in military hospitals were not transferred to public facilities, which still struggle with drug-resistant infections.\n\nThe health system in Afghanistan has been fragmented by decades of war. Civilian hospitals are understaffed, underfunded and overburdened, and superbugs made the civilian population in war zones an object of fear, said Dr. Christian Haggenmiller, a former senior NATO medical officer in Afghanistan.\n\nThough Army staff were prioritized at military hospitals, some Afghan citizens were also treated there because so many were injured in the conflict and local hospitals were often inaccessible or in poor condition. Many military facilities carried out life-saving treatment on locals but then referred them to public hospitals for rehabilitation.\n\nMilitary medical facilities sometimes rejected civilian patients because of fear that they carried resistant bacteria that could infect the intensive care unit for military personnel, Haggenmiller said. As a result, they were often treated separately in isolation tents, away from the main medical facilities.\n\n\"It's your worst nightmare, having a drug-resistant strain in your health facility that you can't control. It's like a new disease,\" Haggenmiller said.\n\nAntibiotic addiction\n\nAfghanistan has some of the worst health outcomes in the world. One woman dies every two hours from pregnancy-related causes, according to conservative estimates by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), and one in 25 newborn babies dies, the third highest neonatal death rate in the world, UNICEF figures show.\n\nLife expectancy at birth is 64, compared with 79 in the US and a global average of 72. There is a shortage of doctors, especially in rural areas, and infection control is poor.\n\nDrug resistance has become one of the world's greatest public health crises, estimated to cause 700,000 deaths worldwide and expected to kill 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken.\n\nFueling the superbug problem in Afghanistan is the unregulated sale of antibiotics in human medicine and in agriculture. Drugs are advertised on television and available to buy over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription or diagnosis from a doctor.\n\n\"They give them out like sweets,\" said Dr. Doris Burtscher, a medical anthropologist at Medecins Sans Frontieres. Burtscher compiled a report in 2015 about attitudes to antibiotics at a public hospital in Kabul and found that the drugs were taken for such issues as bruised knees, nosebleeds and body pain, as well as by women after menstruating.\n\nA 'typical case'\n\nDrs. Niamatullah Lodin and Younas Joyan describe a typical case from April at Mohmand hospital in Kandahar, the country's second-biggest city.\n\nMohmand is a glass-fronted private hospital that provides free public health care during the month of Ramadan and thus treats a surge of patients during this time.\n\nA 35-year-old woman was brought to the hospital, unconscious and in a coma, by her family. She had given birth three days earlier and developed an infection. The bacteria got into her bloodstream, causing life-threatening septic shock. Lodin and Joyan gave her three antibiotics -- ceftriaxone, vancomycin and metronidazole -- but there was no improvement.\n\nPatients at Antoni Infectious Disease Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan.\n\nThe two doctors checked her white blood cell count, an indicator of immune activity in response to microbes in the blood. A normal level is between 400 and 1,000. Hers was 19,000 and didn't fall as expected after being given antibiotics. She had a severe and resistant infection.\n\nThe woman had lost a lot of blood after giving birth; her blood volume fell rapidly, and her kidneys began to fail.\n\nThe doctors were forced to give her linezolid, an antibiotic used only for serious and resistant infections, as it is toxic and can have dangerous side effects. A long course will suppress the bone marrow, which will cause bleeding due to a low platelet count, anemia due to a lack of red blood cells and increased susceptibility to further infections due to a low white blood cell count. The drug is also poisonous to the kidneys and can cause severe skin rashes. Patients have died from the side effects.\n\n\"Giving linezolid to the patient was a difficult decision for us because it is a very strong antibiotic,\" said Joyan, an internal medicine specialist. \"But when we saw her resistance against vancomycin and ceftriaxone, we were obligated to give her linezolid, because it was the last option for us. If we didn't give her linezolid, she would have died.\"\n\nFortunately, this antibiotic worked; the woman's pulse returned to normal, and she started eating again a day later. \"The patient and her family were too pleased for what we did,\" said Lodin, a pediatric specialist at Mohmand. As the family was poor, the hospital didn't charge for care.\n\nBut not all patients who arrive at the hospital are so lucky.\n\nLodin and Joyan said they see patients with drug-resistant infections from Streptococcus and Klebsiella bacteria who have died. Around 15% of infections are drug-resistant, commonly in patients with pneumonia, kidney infections and digestive system infections that do not respond. The most common multidrug-resistant infections seen are from E. coli or TB bacteria, they said.\n\nAn estimated 1,400 people developed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Afghanistan in 2016, according to WHO, although only 138 were detected and treated.\n\n'Other doctors not having the guts to work here'\n\nIn Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, Dr. Mohammad Saber Hotak is head of pharmaceuticals at the public Antoni Infectious Disease Hospital.\n\nThe hospital is cramped and unclean. Very ill or unconscious patients lie in beds, their hospital gowns and sheets stained with fluids. It smells of vomit and illness. There is nowhere for families to sleep, so they do so outside the hospital. Just one of the hospital's two machines to give the results of a full blood count, needed to diagnose certain infections or diseases and monitor the effects of treatment, is functional.\n\nHotak says the number of multidrug-resistant infections he has seen has increased by 20% in the past five years.\n\nDr. Mohammad Saber Hotak is head of pharmaceuticals at Antoni Infectious Disease Hospital.\n\nAbout 150 patients a day are treated at the Antoni, many in very poor health. The hospital deals with a daunting range of infections including rabies, meningitis, TB, malaria, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, yellow fever, anthrax, bubonic plague, measles, chicken pox, polio and respiratory infections like pneumonia. It also has to contend with outbreaks of cholera.\n\nIn addition, the hospital battles these contagious diseases with a very limited supply of medicine. It has basic supplies of antibiotics and fluids, but all other drugs have to be purchased by patients or their caretakers, usually from the pharmacy outside. This is the case in most hospitals in Afghanistan, though in other developing countries, patients hospitalized with infections rarely pay for drugs or supplies.\n\nAbout 15% of patients treated at the Antoni have an antibiotic-resistant infection. Hotak said most infections are resistant to \"normal\" antibiotics, and his teams are now seeing resistance to vancomycin, the last-resort drug used to treat multidrug-resistant infections from enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nThe vancomycin-resistant form of these two superbugs is on WHO's list of bacteria for which new antibiotics are urgently needed.\n\nHotak, 48, has worked at the Antoni hospital for nearly 20 years. \"That is due to other doctors not having the guts to work here due to the nature of the hospital, contagious diseases, and those of us who work here had to stay, I guess,\" he said.\n\n\"When you see a patient dying because of complications or resistance to drugs, it makes me feel sad that I couldn't do anything to treat him or her,\" said Dr. Mohammad Sadiq Naimi, head trainer and doctor at the Antoni hospital. \"It has its negative impacts on the brain.\"\n\nOveruse and misuse\n\nOveruse and misuse of antibiotics is the main factor fueling resistance worldwide.\n\nIn Afghanistan, there is a strong cultural trend toward taking antibiotics, Burtscher said.. There is a belief that the dirty and dusty environment in the country causes \"disease\" in the body and that antibiotics are needed to \"clean\" it. People take them for nonbacterial conditions, like colds or general body weakness, while women are given them after delivering a baby, she said.\n\nPatients travel miles to buy drugs, and families stockpile them for when relatives get sick.\n\nAntoni Infectious Disease Hospital in Kabul.\n\nIn addition, pharmacists do not always follow the regulations around prescribing the right drug or the full dose, which further fuels resistance. Patients are able to buy just one tablet of an antibiotic if they wish, but taking an incomplete course of antibiotics means the infection is not killed, and the most drug-resistant bacteria survive and replicate.\n\nThere is also a problem with counterfeit and substandard antibiotics smuggled in from Pakistan or Iran. These contain either none of the active ingredient or less than the advertised dose, again fueling resistance because a low dose means not all the bacteria will be killed by the drug, and the resistant ones will survive and spread.\n\nThe perception of substandard drugs can also cause some doctors to prescribe higher amounts.\n\nAn unknown scale\n\nLike most public hospitals in Afghanistan, the Antoni does not have a formalized database to keep track of patients, their illnesses or resistance patterns to antibiotics, and so there is no empirical data to enable useful surveillance. Information is captured in handwritten books.\n\nTo find out how many patients have died, you would have to go through the notebooks one by one, Naimi said.\n\nSimilarly, across Afghanistan, nobody knows the scale of the superbug problem because there is no centralized system for recording the most common infections and their resistance patterns.\n\nDr. Mohammad Sadiq Naimi, head trainer and doctor at the Antoni hospital, in his office.\n\nThe US military was in the same position during the first eight years of the war. Dr. Emil Lesho, a retired colonel who led the US Army's antimicrobial resistance program, found that Army medical records had no code to record resistant infections, so nobody knew the true scale of the problem. Many facilities didn't have the ability to identify resistant bacteria.\n\nIn 2009, he set up a centralized laboratory to which all branches of the military could send bacteria samples, which also acted as a surveillance system: the Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network.\n\nDoctors could find out exactly what was causing a patient's infection and the antibiotics that would be effective, so they could provide more targeted treatment.\n\nLesho credits the network with reducing hospital infections and improving infection control through monitoring bacteria and giving feedback to facilities.\n\nThe same has not been possible in public hospitals, as data is much more scarce.\n\nA handful of studies show an emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in public hospitals in Afghanistan, echoing trends across the Middle East. One study , from two public hospitals in Kabul, found that 56% of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were resistant to methicillin, the main drug used to fight it, with the majority of these bacteria resistant to multiple drugs. Across the US, the proportion is 46%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nTo quantify the problem, you need a surveillance system like the military's, with laboratories equipped with the technology and staff to grow microbes and perform tests to see which antibiotics will work against them. Afghanistan has only 14 public microbiology labs in seven provinces. More labs are set to open this year, but even then, 20 out of 34 provinces will still have no access to public facilities.\n\nAmongst the existing labs, the quality between public and private labs can vary, meaning doctors do not always send samples of a patient's infection to a lab.\n\n\"Some of them, and they say 'Oh, if I send a sample to the laboratory, I don't rely on the evidence,' \" said Dr. Safiullah Nadeeb, WHO's lead on antimicrobial resistance in Afghanistan. Stressed doctors are often also trying to treat 100 patients a day and so don't have time to send off for tests, he added.\n\nLab staff at the Antoni hospital examine a urine sample.\n\nNadeeb is trying to improve infection control in Afghan hospitals by introducing guidelines on how to perform procedures in a sanitary way, how to clean the hospital adequately and how to dispose of waste hygienically, as well as establish a surveillance system for resistant bacteria.\n\nThe country has also enrolled in WHO's Global Antibiotic Surveillance System, in which countries all around the world will submit data under the same protocols. Four sites in Afghanistan have been selected and will gather data to international standards. \"Maybe by next year, we will have very good data,\" Nadeeb said. Until then, \"we are not able to report resistance, and we are not able to address the issue.\"\n\nImproving surveillance and infection control were two of the key changes made by the US Army in its program to reduce superbugs -- a luxury that civilian hospitals cannot imagine.\n\nFinding solutions during a war\n\nThe US military's Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research program paved the way for how superbugs to be controlled in the absence of new drugs.\n\nOver six years, doctors worked to lower resistance rates: improving hygiene and infection control, isolating patients when they came into the hospital until they had been tested for drug resistance, introducing better record-keeping around the antibiotics patients had received and reducing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nThe program started with an annual budget of a $1.5 million, which doubled within a year. It spent an additional $6 million on genetic testing of microbes, linking the results to clinical data.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor public hospitals in Afghanistan, implementing even low-cost infection control measures has been difficult. More than 88,000 civilians have been killed or injured during the conflict since 2009, when the UN started reporting casualties.\n\n\"If you go to some hospitals and say 'why can't you apply these measures of infection prevention,' they will say, 'I don't have chlorine. I don't have gloves,' \" Nadeeb said.\n\nEven in a top-down, command-and-control system like the US military, it still took six years for improvements, some very basic, to take effect, highlighted Liz Tayler, a technical expert on antimicrobial resistance with WHO.\n\n\"The fact that it still took so much time in a military setting shows what a tough time developing countries are going to have in tackling the problem,\" she said.", "Hong Kong (CNN Business) Tech tycoon Jack Ma really hates the trade war between the United States and China.\n\n\"Trade war is the most stupid thing in this world,\" Ma said Monday at a conference in Shanghai hosted by the Chinese government.\n\nThe United States and China have slapped heavy new tariffs on huge swathes of each other's exports this year. The US government accuses China of stealing American intellectual property and forcing US firms to handover valuable tech. But US President Donald Trump has also repeatedly complained about his country's $375 billion deficit in the trade of goods with China.\n\nMa argued Monday that the purpose of trade should be to promote peace and communication rather than conflict, and that the rise of protectionism is misguided.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

same area.\n\nAll three attacks occurred in Cid Harbour, a picturesque bay surrounded by beaches in a popular tourist area on the north coast of Queensland.\n\nThe most recent attack occurred on Monday when a 33-year-old man from Victoria suffered fatal injuries.\n\nThe man was on a sailing holiday with 10 friends and the group was taking turns to paddle board on the water, Queensland Police said . When the man jumped off the board, he was attacked by a shark.\n\nSteve O'Connell, Whitsundays patrol inspector, told reporters that the man had lost a substantive amount of blood, and had began to go into cardiac arrest.\n\nFriends and rescue crews at the scene tried to resuscitate the man until he was airlifted to nearby Mackay Base Hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries.\n\n\"Every solid effort was made to save that man's life,\" O'Connell said. \"His injuries and the reaction to those injuries was so severe that, unfortunately, he did not survive long after his arrival.\"\n\nPolice said Tuesday that they have not publicly identified the man as they were still working to contact his next of kin.\n\nThe Whitsunday Water Police, as well as boats from the Boating and Fisheries patrol and Marine Safety Queensland, are conducting patrols and warning people not to swim in the waters close to the incident.\n\nThe species of shark has not yet been determined.\n\nBen McCauley, one of the RACQ CQ rescue crew members who helped airlift the man to hospital, described the scene as \"gruesome,\" according to CNN affiliate Seven News\n\n\"It was one of the more difficult ones for everyone involved. The scene is what you would imagine a shark attack to be like. A lot of blood, a lot of confusion,\" he said.\n\nThe attack is the third serious incident involving sharks to occur in the Cid Harbour in under two months.\n\nOn September 20, a 12-year-old girl was left in a serious condition after a shark bit her on the leg.\n\nLess than a day earlier, 46-year-old Tasmanian tourist Justine Barwick suffered a major injury to her upper left thigh. The shark bite left her bleeding profusely and needing emergency surgery, Seven News reported.\n\nO'Connell said that this year's three major attacks remain an anomaly for the area.\n\n\"I've been in the Whitsunday area on and off for 30 years, and apart from some minor nips and bites, we've never heard of any substantial attacks such as what we've seen in these three attacks,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\nFollowing the two attacks in September, Australian fisheries authorities killed six sharks -- including a 3.7-meter (12-foot) tiger shark -- in the Whitsunday Islands area after drum lines were temporarily deployed.\n\nDrum lines are aquatic traps that use a series of buoys and baited hooks to lure sharks.\n\nIn a joint statement with Australia's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Tourism Minister Kate Jones said the priority was to reinforce the message that people should not swim in the harbor.\n\nSigns will be installed around the area warning people not to go swimming there, Jones said, adding that, \"Neither the local mayor, Andrew Willcox, marine authorities nor local tourism operators want to see drum lines redeployed.\"\n\nFisheries Minister Mark Furner said in the statement that the harbor is a popular site to moor boats and the disposal of food scraps could attract sharks.\n\n\"We can't be clearer -- don't swim in Cid Harbour,\" he said.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nIn January, the Marines will land on Catalina by boat and helicopter from mainland bases. They'll camp at the airport as they would in a field situation, and they'll have 500 tons of equipment to use, the conservancy said.\n\nThe result will be a more durable concrete runway for the island destination\n\n\"With this runway repair project, I would project more than 75 years of runway operations in our future,\" says Tony Budrovich, president and CEO of the CIC.\n\nThe runway, sitting at an elevation of 1,600 feet, was carved out of two mountaintops with a valley between filled in. The final result left it a bit higher in the middle than at the ends. That means that when rumbling down it, pilots can have trouble seeing where the runway ends.\n\nThe CIC says the runway gives pilots using it the feeling of landing on an aircraft carrier.\n\nBut the Marines aren't getting involved so military aviators can simulate carrier landings.\n\nThey're coming for two other reasons: Building a runway on Catalina is great training for building or repairing one on some battle-scarred island in the future, and they can help the nonprofit conservancy save an aircraft-carrier-load of money.\n\nThe conservancy puts the bill for the project at $5 million. It will be paid for by private donations.\n\nThe U.S. Marine labor saved another $1 million from being added to that, conservancy spokeswoman Laura Mecoy says.\n\nCatalina's \"Airport in the Sky.\" Raquel Lonas/Moment Open/Getty Images\n\nThe runway work falls under the Defense Department's Innovative Readiness Training Program, which has a mission \"to produce mission-ready forces through military training opportunities that provide key services for American communities,\" according to its website.\n\n\"This challenging project allows Marines to gain valuable experience in repairing damaged runways, and increases our capabilities and readiness to tackle a range of military operations across the globe,\" Marine Lt. Col. Duncan Buchanan says in a statement.\n\nHe added: \"It also ensures that the community benefits from a fully operational airport for daily provisions as well as to aid in any potential recovery efforts after natural disasters.\"\n\nAs if on cue last week, Marines 6,000 miles away across the Pacific had a real-time example of what the colonel was talking about.\n\n\"Taking advantage of stateside training opportunities such as the [Catalina Island Conservancy] Runway In The Sky project are vital and prepare us for events such as this,\" said a 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing Facebook post linking to a report from Tinian, where Marines were taking the lead in cleanup and repairs after Supertyphoon Yutu ravaged the US island territory of 3,000 people.\n\nThe Airport in the Sky is an important lifeline for the 4,000 residents of Catalina as well as the 1 million people who visit the island every year, as more than 2 million pounds of freight move through it yearly, Budrovich said.\n\nThe majority of those Catalina visitors come by boat, however. Only 13,000 passengers came through the Airport in the Sky in the first nine months of 2018, according to the island's Chamber of Commerce. Still, the runway sees 14,000 takeoff and landings in a year.\n\nApproaching Catalina Island's Airport in the Sky. Pam Susemiehl/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nGeoff Rusack, a pilot and Santa Barbara resident who oversees a ranch on the island, says he uses the runway about 50 times a year, and has been doing so for 35 years.\n\n\"I hear that some other pilots avoid it because of hearing of the runway's condition,\" he tells CNN Travel.\n\n\"Due to plane landings, potholes form and loose asphalt pieces can end up on the runway surface,\" explains Rusack, who is also a member of the conservancy's board.\n\nThe Marines' work should eliminate that, and while landing on the runway can be challenging, it's worth the trip, he said.\n\n\"When they choose Catalina, [pilots] and their passengers are in for a special treat -- not just on the journey over, but the beautiful vistas when approaching, the thrill of landing at this special place ... and the experience they get when on the island,\" Rusack said.\n\nThe idea of working with the military first came up two years ago, the conservancy said.\n\n\"The Conservancy Team and our great military partners have been working really hard behind the scenes to make this project a reality,\" says Kellie Johnson, chairman of the Catalina Island Conservancy Board.\n\n\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we are really excited to better serve the communities of Catalina and to attract aviation enthusiasts from around the country.\"", "(CNN) Facebook took down a network of Facebook pages and Instagram accounts Monday night after a tip from US law enforcement, just a few hours before polls open in this year's midterm elections.\n\n\"On Sunday evening, US law enforcement contacted us about online activity that they recently discovered and which they believe may be linked to foreign entities,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, the company's head of cybersecurity, said in a statement.\n\nThe company removed 30 Facebook accounts and 85 Instagram accounts.\n\n\"Almost all the Facebook Pages associated with these accounts appear to be in the French or Russian languages, while the Instagram accounts seem to have mostly been in English -- some were focused on celebrities, others political debate,\" Gleicher wrote.\n\n\"Once we know more -- including whether these accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency or other foreign entities -- we will update this post,\" he added.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Godolphin's Cross Counter has won Australia's most prestigious horse race, the Melbourne Cup, setting a series of firsts but giving jockey Kerrin McEvoy his third Cup trophy.\n\nThe British-bred horse saw off rivals in a field of 24 to take the Cup, the annual blockbuster event at Flemington Racecourse that this year was drenched by heavy rain that soaked spectators and the 3200-meter (two mile) track.\n\nTrained by Charlie Appleby, Cross Counter became the first English-trained horse to win the race, taking the top prize of $2.8 million.

A hotel in Sydney has faced both backlash and praise for hosting an anti-Melbourne Cup event, News.com.au reported.\n\nProtesters used the opportunity on Tuesday to highlight animal rights and the country's treatment of refugees.\n\nThe Cup dates back to 1865 and was the result of a rivalry between two horse race organizing committees -- the Victorian Jockey Club and the Victorian Turf Club, with the latter introducing the event as a handicap race. While it's now famously run on the first Tuesday of November, it wasn't until 10 years after its inauguration that the date became the tradition. It's since become the defining fixture of the Australian horse racing calendar.\n\nWhile the first Cup was won in 1865, the race was originally run four years earlier -- but the winner only received prizes and a cash purse. The winner of the first Cup, Mr Marshall, owner of Tory Boy, described it as a \"monstrosity,\" according to the National Museum of Australia.\n\nOutlandish celebration avoided\n\nThe Melbourne Cup has long eluded British trainers, and while Magic Circle had a good opportunity to break the spell, it was another UK-based horse that took that honor.\n\nMagic Circle, a pre-race favorite, was already a six-time winner when he joined Williams' 100-strong string at Dominion Stables and looked the part for the British trainer and owner Marwan Koukash after claiming stellar victories in the Chester Cup and at Sandown this season before booking his place in Tuesday's headline event at Flemington.\n\nWilliams has already entered the history books by becoming the first trainer to win at every racecourse -- Flat or jump racing -- in the UK, but came up short with Magic Circle, a six-year-old gelding he bought last October for Koukash, a former refugee from the Middle East who has built up a multimillion dollar business in England's northwest.\n\nCross Counter's win has spared Melburnians the sight of Koukash's outlandish planned celebration.\n\n\"I fit into my G-string now,\" Koukash told racing.com three days before the race.\n\n\"I fit into my G-String now.\" Meet Magic Circle's owner @drmarwank.

Two centuries later, it had found its way into the private collection of Samuel Morse, the inventor of Morse code.\n\nIt's now just one of 150 breathtaking artifacts borrowed from the private collection of Qatar's ruling family for the exhibition, \" East Meets West: Jewels of the Maharajas from The Al Thani Collection \" at San Francisco's Legion of Honor.\n\nThe Al Thani Collection comprises Indian art and jewels from the Mughal Empire through to the present. It was established by Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family. To bring the precious items together, he enlisted the help of Amin Jaffer, the international director of Asian art at Christie's, who helped collect more than 400 pieces in just two years.\n\nThe earliest pieces on display date back to 1526, when the Mughals -- a Muslim dynasty with roots in Central Asia -- invaded northern India and founded an Empire. By that time, Europeans had already established trading posts in India, and the Mughal emperors were fascinated by the technology they used to craft jewelry (in particular, techniques for cutting gemstones), as well as overseas treasures, such as emeralds from Colombia.\n\nIn return, Europeans were stunned by the wealth of the Mughals. The treasury of the emperor Jahangir, for example, was said to have included more than five million carats of uncut diamonds. A 16th-century Flemish gem trader, Jacques de Coutre, is said to have observed that Jahangir had more jewels than the monarchs of Europe combined.\n\nThe Mughals and the Europeans went on to forge close links, according to the exhibition's co-curator, Martin Chapman.\n\n\"Western jewelers and goldsmiths worked at the Mughal courts, while the techniques and tastes of European jewelry houses continued to exercise great appeal among Indian princes,\" he said.\n\n\"In later years, it was to Europe that the maharajas flocked in order to reset gems in their treasuries, inspiring a fusion of Indian forms and tastes with Western settings that characterizes an apogee of 20th-century jewelry design.\"\n\nJapan's handmade, floating hotel\n\nGender is also addressed in the exhibition, added Chapman, with almost all of the pieces made for -- and worn by -- men:\n\n\"We in the West seem to think that only women wear jewelry,\" he said. \"But it is the men in India, specifically the male rulers -- Mughal emperors and maharajas -- who turn our expectations on their heads with their extravagant and elaborate jewelry: bangles, bracelets, rings, necklaces and earrings, as well as the most characteristic jewel, the turban ornament.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) \u2013 Tal vez te sientas tentado a publicar una foto en Instagram cuando llegues a las cabina de votaci\u00f3n este martes, para las elecciones intermedias.

As\u00ed que, por ahora, John Gleason del la Comisi\u00f3n Judicial del Senado dice que esta vez no tuviste suerte. \u201cGracias a una ley aprobada en 2015, se permiten los dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos en el lugar de votaci\u00f3n, pero no se pueden usar\u201d, le explic\u00f3 a CNN.\n\nTexas: Keith Ingram, director de elecciones, nos explic\u00f3: \u201cNo se permite que las personas usen dispositivos de comunicaci\u00f3n inal\u00e1mbricos a menos de 30 metros de las mesas de votaci\u00f3n.

Hazle caso a Keith.\n\nVirginia Occidental: la ley dice que no puedes \u201cgrabar o interferir con el proceso de votaci\u00f3n\u201d, pero hay un giro interesante: ahora existe una aplicaci\u00f3n que convierte a Virginia Occidental en el primer estado del pa\u00eds que permite a las personas votar en las elecciones federales usando un smartphone \u00bfAlucinante?

Hay muchas razones por las que esta medida es totalmente comprensible: la m\u00e1s importante est\u00e1 relacionada con la compra de votos.

Eso significa que no puedes publicar una selfie con tu voto.\n\nLouisiana: la ley estatal dice que los votantes no deben \"permitir que se vea su boleta\" ni \"anunciar la manera en que una persona emiti\u00f3 su voto\". Entonces se permiten selfies, pero no con una papeleta ya marcada.\n\nMassachusetts: nada de selfies con tu boleta, amigo o amiga. Pero, nuevamente, resulta muy poco lo que el estado puede hacer para hacer cumplir las leyes, seg\u00fan Brian McNiff, portavoz del secretario de la Commonwealth.\n\nMinnesota: dos estatutos dicen que mostrar a otros tu boleta marcada es algo que debes evitar.

Si todav\u00eda insistes y quieres tomarte la selfie: adelante. Solo piensa en las palabras inimitables de Ian Malcolm en Jurassic Park: estar\u00e1s tan preocupado de si puedes o no hacerlo, que no te detendr\u00e1s a pensar si debes.\n\nArkansas: no hay ninguna ley que proh\u00edba tomarte selfies, dice la Secretar\u00eda de Estado, siempre y cuando no causes interrupciones en el lugar de votaci\u00f3n ni tomes fotos de otras boletas diferentes a la tuya.\n\nCalifornia: \u00a1sonr\u00edan, californianos!

I'm doing my job,\" he said during a campaign stop in DeKalb County that he had been stuck with two bad options. \"This is how we would handle any investigation when something like this comes up. Because I can assure you if I hadn't done anything and the story came out that something was going on, you'd be going 'Why didn't you act?'\"\n\nKemp's decision to directly accuse the opposing party of wrongdoing while running for the state's highest office has further inflamed deep-seated worries over voting rights in Georgia at the height of a historic campaign by his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, to become the country's black female governor. Amid the furor over the purported hacking, Kemp announced Monday that the state had not only broken its 2014 record, but has set a new, all-time record for early voting in a midterm election.\n\n\"The normal course of action would be that you investigate the vulnerability, fix it and then reassure the public. They seem to be doing it backwards,\" Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech professor and one of the experts contacted by Georgia Democrats, told CNN on Monday. \"Rather than addressing the substance of the vulnerability they're assuming everything is fine and attacking the messenger.\"\n\nThe last week of the campaign has included a robocall paid for by white supremacists crudely impersonating megastar Oprah Winfrey , who traveled last week to Georgia to campaign on Abrams' behalf. Kemp denounced the robocall as \"absolutely disgusting,\" but has often trafficked in racial themes during the campaign, including a tweet late Monday tying Abrams to the Black Panthers.\n\nHis campaign has also falsely claimed Abrams encouraged undocumented immigrants to vote and dismissed as \"outside agitators\" critics alleging that he weaponized state law to suppress the minority vote.\n\nThose charges escalated early last month after an Associated Press analysis of public records data found that Kemp's office had put on hold more than 53,000 voter registrations -- nearly 70% of them belonging to African Americans -- because they failed to clear the state's controversial \"exact match\" standard. A subsequent lawsuit led a federal judge to issue an injunction blocking the state from rejecting absentee ballots without taking added steps to notify voters and sort out any signature discrepancies.\n\nKemp on Sunday lit another fuse when his office issued an early morning bulletin that claimed, vaguely and without any proof, that there had been \"a failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system.\" It added, with no further explanation, that the Democratic Party of Georgia had been placed under investigation the night before in connection with the failed breach.\n\nIn reality, a Georgia citizen had discovered what he believed was a flaw in the system and sought to bring it to the attention of authorities.\n\nA series of emails, obtained by CNN, including an exchange between Georgia Democratic party operatives, refer to findings by an unaffiliated voter, Richard Wright, who said he had discovered potential vulnerabilities in the state's voter information page and its online registration system. The Secretary of State received the chain of emails from a representative of a cybersecurity expert who the Georgia Democratic Party asked to evaluate the potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\"If Richard Wright had never contacted the Democratic Party on Saturday morning,\" his lawyer, David Cross, told CNN, \"no one would be talking about the Democratic Party. It's only because Wright alerted them that Kemp draws it back to them.\"\n\nBut it had an immediate impact. Before most voters had gotten out of bed, word of a newly launched probe into election security, already a pressure point for many Americans, had spread across the state and country.\n\nThat meant added work for Abrams, who kept up her planned bus tour schedule while also calling in to radio stations and appearing on national television -- for a second day running -- to both push back against Kemp's claims and cast them as new evidence against his candidacy.\n\n\"Even if he weren't a candidate in this election, what he is doing is proving to voters that he cannot be trusted to do his job,\" said Abigail Collazo, Abrams' director of strategic communication on Monday. \"So when you add on the layer of him also being a candidate, it becomes more clear than ever that voters cannot trust Brian Kemp. And that is a message that we have been continually sharing with voters since Day One.\"\n\nShortly after the secretary of state's office went public, Abrams told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" she was unaware of any probe and said Kemp was simply \"desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures.\"\n\nAs Abrams and Georgia Democrats were sorting out what exactly they had been accused of, Kemp's campaign issued a statement on the matter, further politicizing the episode. \"Thanks to the systems and protocols established by Secretary of State Brian Kemp,\" Kemp campaign spokesman said, \"no personal information was breached.\"\n\nIt was an audacious one-two, with Kemp's office effectively setting the predicate and his campaign following up with more direct, but legally immaterial, suggestions of criminal behavior.\n\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation added a statement Monday that its Georgia Cyber Crime Center had opened a criminal investigation at the request of Kemp's office.\n\n\"It's wrong to call it an investigation,\" Abrams had told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" hours before. \"It's a witch hunt that was created by someone who is abusing his power.\"\n\nAs Kemp defended the steps taken by office and after it had assured voters that there were no breaches in the system, a ProPublica report alleged that state officials were tinkering -- as late as Sunday night -- with code on the website in question.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office, denied the report.\n\n\"There is no such vulnerability in the system as alleged by the ProPublica article,\" Broce said. \"We immediately reviewed claims of such vulnerabilities once we received them, and our cyber security team -- which includes top-notch, private sector cyber security vendors -- could not substantiate any of them.\"", "In an interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group, President Trump said that he wishes he could have had a softer tone when asked if he has any regrets from his first two years in office.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEn 2012, el 19% de los votantes registrados dijeron que no votaron porque estaban ocupados\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 m\u00e1s del 60% de las personas que podr\u00edan votar en una elecci\u00f3n de mitad de per\u00edodo eligen no hacerlo?\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de las personas que son elegibles para votar no ejercen ese derecho\n\n(CNN) - Estados Unidos vota este martes\n\nO, m\u00e1s exactamente: \u00a1cuatro de cada 10 personas habilitadas votar\u00e1n!\n\nLo que suena menos impresionante. Porque, mmmm, es menos impresionante. La idea general de nuestro hermoso experimento en democracia es que las personas, todas, o al menos la mayor\u00eda, participan en ella. Pero una mirada retrospectiva a la historia de las elecciones de medio t\u00e9rmino deja una cosa muy clara: tradicionalmente, la mayor\u00eda de las personas que pueden votar no ejercen ese derecho.\n\nEn la \u00faltima elecci\u00f3n intermedia, 2014, poco m\u00e1s del 36% de la poblaci\u00f3n apta para votar realmente vot\u00f3. Ese es el porcentaje de participaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s bajo en m\u00e1s de 70 a\u00f1os. En 36 estados, la participaci\u00f3n se redujo de donde estaba en 2010.\n\nLEE: La guerra por el derecho a votar, \u00bftendr\u00e1 peso tu voto?\n\nSi bien 2014 fue malo, en 2010 no fue mucho mejor. Un poco m\u00e1s del 40% de los votantes elegibles votaron. La historia fue la misma en 2006 (40,4%) y 2002 (39,5%).\n\nEsos n\u00fameros deslucidos existen pese a que 37 estados ahora ofrecen votaci\u00f3n anticipada, lo que significa que puedes votar d\u00edas o incluso semanas antes del d\u00eda de las elecciones.\n\nEntonces, \u00bfqu\u00e9 pasa? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 m\u00e1s del 60% de las personas que podr\u00edan votar en una elecci\u00f3n de mitad de per\u00edodo eligen no hacerlo? Aqu\u00ed hay algunas de las razones m\u00e1s grandes:\n\n1. Apat\u00eda\n\n\"Estas son las elecciones intermedias\", dijo Trump en Missouri durante el fin de semana. \"Nadie pens\u00f3 en las elecciones intermedias como algo tan importante durante a\u00f1os. Escuchar las elecciones intermedias, es como si nos fu\u00e9semos a dormir, \u00bfverdad?\", continu\u00f3.\n\nPor desgracia, s\u00ed. Si bien la competencia presidencial es el tipo de evento cargado de drama por el que los estadounidenses tienden a sentir atracci\u00f3n, la intermedias son menos sexis.\n\nSi bien el control del Congreso es importante, MUCHO, el elector casual tiende a sentirse un poco \"meh\" sobre la idea de esperar en una fila para votar por candidatos que apenas conoce.\n\n2. Reglas de votaci\u00f3n\n\nEl mayor impedimento para votar es no registrarse para votar. A diferencia de otros pa\u00edses del mundo, Estados Unidos no registra autom\u00e1ticamente a las personas para votar cuando cumplen 18 a\u00f1os y, por lo tanto, son elegibles para votar.\n\nMuchas y muchas personas que PODR\u00cdAN votar no se registraron para votar, por lo que cuando llega el d\u00eda de las elecciones quedan excluidas del proceso. Hay 17 estados, m\u00e1s el Distrito de Columbia, donde puede inscribirse el mismo d\u00eda. Pero eso significa que hay 33 estados en los que el registro en el mismo d\u00eda no est\u00e1 disponible, y cada uno de esos estados tiene reglas espec\u00edficas y \u00fanicas cuando se trata de c\u00f3mo registrarse.\n\nLo que es fascinante es que si puedes inscribirte para votar, existe una MUY buena posibilidad de que, en realidad, votes. Los estudios han demostrado que en alg\u00fan lugar alrededor del 90% de las personas que est\u00e1n registradas para votar realmente votan.\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay restricciones que algunos estados ponen en la votaci\u00f3n, especialmente la identificaci\u00f3n del votante. Hay 34 estados donde los votantes tienen que mostrar alg\u00fan tipo de identificaci\u00f3n con foto para poder votar. Muchos dem\u00f3cratas se quejan de que tales leyes no hacen nada para asegurar las elecciones, que es su prop\u00f3sito declarado, y en cambio son esfuerzos para deprimir la participaci\u00f3n entre las circunscripciones no blancas.\n\n3. Ocupado, ocupado, ocupado\n\nEsta es la excusa m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil y, desafortunadamente, la m\u00e1s com\u00fan que ofrecen las personas para no votar.\n\nEn 2012, el 19% de los votantes registrados dijeron que no votaron porque estaban ocupados.\n\nCuriosamente, ese n\u00famero se redujo a 14% en 2016. \u00bfAdivinas qu\u00e9 se dispar\u00f3? La gente a la que no le gustaron los candidatos o los temas de la campa\u00f1a. Uno de cada cuatro no votantes dijo que odiaban a los dos candidatos en 2016.\n\nLEE: Trump sacude la campa\u00f1a con un nuevo anuncio racista a unos d\u00edas de las elecciones\n\n\u00bfPodr\u00eda 2018 romper este molde de mediano plazo de baja participaci\u00f3n?

Esto es lo que dijo el domingo en Georgia: \"Nunca ha habido multitudes como esta, solo para que entiendan, en la historia de la pol\u00edtica\".\n\nTrump rompi\u00f3 todas las reglas en 2016. \u00bfPodr\u00eda hacer lo mismo en 2018 para atraer a los votantes a las urnas?

Joseph Dunford said Monday that the US military will not be \"involved in the actual mission of denying people entry to the United States.\"\n\nWhen asked about the border mission for active-duty troops, Dunford said the military will not be coming into contact with migrants traveling toward the border.\n\n\"There is no plan for US military forces to be involved in the actual mission of denying people entry to the United States,\" Dunford said, speaking at an event at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \"There is no plan for soldiers to come in contact with immigrants or to reinforce Department of Homeland Security as they're conducting their mission.\"\n\n\"We are providing enabling capabilities,\" Dunford said, explaining they were tasked with supporting the DHS.\n\nJust before the midterm elections, President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the southern border to guard against what he has called an \"invasion\" by a group of migrants heading north through Mexico to the United States.\n\nDespite Trump's unsubstantiated claim that the group of Central American migrants includes \"gang members and some very bad people,\" most of the migrants reportedly plan to apply for asylum once they arrive at the border, following legal procedures.\n\nDunford said the DHS requested logistical support, \"so you'll see some soldiers down there right now that are putting up concertina wire and reinforcing the points of entry,\" and that the military is providing \"both trucks and helicopter support and then also some medical support.\"\n\nPentagon spokesman Col. Rob Manning said Monday, \"There are currently more than 4,800 personnel deployed in support of this mission. This continues to be a dynamic situation with more units and personnel deploying to the operating area, and we expect to reach 5,200 deployed personnel as early as today.\"\n\n\"DoD anticipates more than 7,000 active-duty troops will be supporting DHS soon,\" Manning said. The breakdown of personnel includes \"1,100 in California, 1,100 in (Arizona) and 2,600 in Texas,\" according to Manning.\n\nIn response to criticism of himself and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who signed off on the request for assistance, Dunford said the President gave them a legal order and it is not his job to \"assess the appropriateness of the mission.\"\n\n\"The President gave us a legal order: Support the Department of Homeland Security,\" Dunford said.\n\n\"It's not my job to assess the appropriateness of the mission,\" Dunford said. \"It's my job to accept the legality of the mission and, again, the capability of our forces to perform that mission. So others outside the ring can make a subjective assessment as to what ... we're doing but I'm not going to comment on that.\"\n\nAs a military leader, Dunford said, the questions he asks are: Is the order legal, is the order unambiguous and do the troops have the capability to perform the task. \"And the answer is yes in all three cases,\" he said.\n\nTrump's decision to deploy active-duty US troops and the earlier deployment of National Guard forces to the southern border could cost between $200 million and $300 million, according to an independent analysis and Department of Defense figures on guard deployments.\n\nAsked about criticism of the decision by his predecessor and other retired senior officers, Dunford said \"To be honest with you, I wish they wouldn't do that, but they certainly can do that if they want to.\"\n\nRetired Gen. Martin Dempsey, who served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2011 to 2015, tweeted Friday that \"our men and women in uniform are better trained, better equipped, and better led so they meet any threat with confidence.

They won't.\"", "Yatesville, Pennsylvania (CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden grasped the microphone tightly as he delivered his closing pitch for Democrats, his normally booming voice gone after a week of campaigning and replaced with something much lower and hoarse.\n\nBiden's mission over the past week was straightforward: help Democrats make their closing argument heading into Tuesday's elections. But his six day, eight-state campaign swing, which took him to college campuses, union halls, suburb fairgrounds and even the early nominating state of Iowa, also carried the trappings of an opening act with chants of \"Run Joe Run!\" filling many of his 12 rallies over the last week.\n\n\"The only thing strong enough to tear apart America is America itself, and we've seen it start, and we have to stop it and that's what Tuesday's about,\" Biden said Sunday in Yatesville just a few miles from his birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, a city upon which he's centered much of his blue collar, middle-class message. \"We have to make clear that Democrats, Democrats choose hope over fear. Democrats choose unity over division, and most importantly, we choose truth over lies.\"\n\n\"It's time to get up. Remember who in the hell we are. This is America,\" added Biden, who was struck with laryngitis over his last few days of campaigning.\n\nBiden has made no secret he's considering a run for president in 2020, but he's said that decision will come after the midterms, training his focus instead on helping Democrats win back the House and Senate.\n\nWhile he campaigned for Sen.

This isn't about me.\"\n\nBut come Wednesday, it will be about him and that decision he has to make.\n\nAfter he voted at a high school in Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday, Biden said he remains undecided on a 2020 run.\n\n\"I have to make my decision what I'm going to do after the first of the year. It'll be a family decision, and we have time,\" he said.\n\nWhile he said an internal decision would come then, he wouldn't formally announce that soon.\n\n\"I wouldn't announce even if I were going to run that early. It'd be too early to get started,\" he said.\n\nBiden added he wasn't sure when he would announce a decision: \"That would depend on the circumstances in the field and a whole lot of things.\"\n\nOver the past week, I spoke with nearly four dozen Democratic and independent voters at Biden rallies in seven states about his 2020 prospects. The verdict about whether he should run for president was mixed.\n\n\"I wanted to come see Biden because I think he's what we need. He's a fighter for our country and he fights for our people,\" Michael Simonik, a route sales driver from Jessup, Pa., said. \"I hope he runs. I think he would be a great candidate, and I think he would beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nDan Sekera, a graphic designer from Luzerne, Pennsylvania, said it's time for a \"new face.\"\n\n\"We just had a dinner with my grandparents today, and they were talking how they would really like Biden to run, but I think there will be a big disconnect between the millennials and generations you need,\" Sekera said. \"All my friends say, 'If you're a centrist, you're basically as bad as the Republicans.' And Biden kind of floats in that area.\"\n\n\"No,\" Stan Shanker, a retired metals trader who now volunteers helping refugees in the St. Louis area, said about a Biden 2020 run. \"I love him. ... We're big fans of him for sure. I just think that the country needs, new blood, new ways of doing things. For sure we can learn from people like Vice President Biden, but I just think that we need fresh\" people.\n\n\"I thought Joe was great, genuine. I felt that he was very humble to be here and all around he puts off a good vibe,\" Jenna Spigutz, a nanny from Willoughby, Ohio, said. \"I just think he was a great vice president, so why wouldn't he make a great president?\n\n\"Hopefully Obama can be vice,\" Spigutz added. \"Biden-Obama 2020.\"\n\nBiden's closing argument\n\nOver the past few months, Biden has endorsed more than 130 candidates and traveled to roughly two dozen states for rallies, fundraisers and other stops to support 65 candidates. As of last week, Biden's PAC, American Possibilities, had disbursed nearly $600,000 directly to candidates' campaigns, an aide to Biden said.\n\nAlong the way, Biden has promoted Democrats as the party to protect health care, and entitlement programs, like Social Security and Medicare, and to fight for middle class workers. But he's also framed this election as a \"battle for the soul of America,\" preaching the need for political leaders to promote decency and moral integrity.\n\n\"We have to reset the moral compass of this nation, and we do that on Tuesday,\" Biden said in Parma Heights, Ohio, on Saturday.\n\nHe's stressed the need for candidates of \"character\" and authenticity, a message that often times sounds like a pitch he's making about himself as much as the candidates for whom he's campaigning.\n\n\"We need people who are authentic, who don't bully or belittle other people, who treat people with dignity and respect. People who simply tell the truth,\" Biden said in Bridgeton.\n\nThat embrace of the truth was at the center of many of Biden's applause lines. After President Trump recently said he tries to tell the truth, when he can, Biden told an Ohio crowd, \"They're trying to convince us that honesty is relative depending on where you stand.\"\n\n\"Truth is truth. Truth is truth. Honesty is honesty,\" he added.\n\nBiden has also called on political leaders to dial back their rhetoric, particularly in the wake of the deadly massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue last month, saying \"words matter.\"\n\n\"Three times this past week the forces of hate and terror have descended on the American political scene, going after people for their political belief, the color of their skin or their religion. Folks we need to recognize that words matter,\" Biden said in Cedar Rapids Iowa.\n\n\"America is so much better than this. We are so much better than this. I know that sometimes it feels like these days like anger and hatred and viciousness are overwhelming us,\" he said. \"It's our leaders that need to set the tone and dial down the temperature, restore some dignity to our national dialogue but it's also the American people and each one of us has the power to change the tone of our discourse in our lives.\"\n\nWhile Biden has toned down some of his own attacks on President Trump, there were times he strayed from his own advice. In Fargo, North Dakota Thursday, Biden seized on comments made by Sen. Heidi Heitkamp's Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer, who earlier this year suggested farmers worried about a trade war need to acquire a higher pain threshold.\n\n\"Your guy calls farmers' concerns hysteria and says they don't have a very high threshold for pain,\" Biden said. \"Well I get that president of the trade unions up here and he'll show him a threshold of pain.\"\n\nWhere Biden went\n\nBiden kicked off his midterm campaign blitz literally running through the streets of Pittsburgh during a Labor Day parade. Since then, he's held 18 rallies across the country.\n\nOver the past month, Biden rallied voters in the six states PresidentDonald Trump flipped from blue to red in 2016 -- Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, many of those states home to competitive governors' races where Democrats see pick-up opportunities.\n\nThe former vice president also campaigned for up-and-coming Democratic candidates in close House races, including Antonio Delgado in New York's 19th Congressional District; Abby Finkenauer in Iowa's 1st Congressional District, Brendan Kelly in Illinois' 12th Congressional District; Amy McGrath in Kentucky's 6th Congressional District; Elissa Slotkin in Michigan's 8th Congressional District; and Lauren Underwood in Illinois's 14th Congressional District.\n\nEver a creature of the Senate, Biden lent his hand to endangered Democratic senators, including Heitkamp, McCaskill and Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Bill Nelson of Florida, and campaigned for Jacky Rosen, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Nevada. Biden's trips to Missouri and North Dakota in the final days of the election made him the most high-profile Democrat to step foot in those state Trump won by double digits.\n\n\"There are probably a lot of people who just don't think that this race is winnable,\" said Steve Rodvold, a retired human resources officer from Fargo. \"When you get somebody like that coming out, hopefully you can motivate some of those people who may not have voted just to get out and understand why it's so important.\"\n\nBiden's final campaign stop landed him in Pennsylvania's Luzerne County, a key area that helped Trump flip the state red. Biden and President Obama won Luzerne County by 5 points in 2012 but Trump carried it by 20 in 2016.\n\nThe breakneck pace at which Biden has recently campaigned will likely subside in the coming weeks. But he already has a few speeches and public commitments tied to his initiatives on his calendar through the end of the year.\n\nOn Sunday in Philadelphia, he'll present the National Constitution Center's annual Liberty Medal to President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush. Later this month, Biden has a string of speeches in California and Arizona as well as a few stops for the paperback release of his memoir \"Promise Me, Dad,\" which will take him to Montana, Texas and Vermont in December. He plans on having some downtime with his family over Thanksgiving in Nantucket, an annual Biden family tradition.\n\nThe Age Factor\n\nAs they await a decision about 2020, voters repeated one hesitancy about a Biden candidacy -- his age.\n\n\"He's a good fella. I wish he was 10 years younger. I think then he would have a better chance, you know, of running for president,\" John Buchholz, a farmer from Casselton, North Dakota, said. \"I think he's probably a little bit beyond his prime. But he's a good guy.\"\n\n\"I like Joe Biden. In fact, I wish he would run. I don't like the way the turn of our politics right now. It just seems like it's dirty, and I'm tired of it,\" said Debbie Feke, who works in customer service from Boardman, Ohio. \"He knows his stuff. He has experience. He's very caring. ... He would be the best qualified candidate, but he's old.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see him run. I'd like to see how he does hold up on the campaign trail, just you know, the age thing,\" said David Gerleman, a retired engineer from Swisher, Iowa. \"Let's face it. The older you get the more likely something like a heart attack or a stroke or something like that could occur and depending on who the vice president ... that could be a crisis. It's just reality.\"\n\nBiden has acknowledged his age would be a \"totally legitimate\" issue for voters to consider should he run for president. But some voters see Biden's age as an advantage.\n\n\"I know age is going to come up,\" said Vicki Kanka, a 67-year-old health care consultant from South Euclid, Ohio, who supports a Biden run. \"I'm older too and there's no reason why you can't be as productive, and I think that with age comes wisdom and that's what we need right now is some wisdom.\"\n\nMost voters said it's too early to predict who they'd side with in a Democratic primary.\n\n\"He's just so inspirational. We have an expression in Yiddish: He's a mensch. Somebody who's real and honest and has good character. We just love him so much,\" said Becky Shimony, a drug prevention educator from the St. Louis area. \"I love Kamala Harris, I love Cory Booker. Those are two of my favorites, but he's up there.\"\n\n\"I would want to see who else is running,\" said Joanne Streit, who worked in hospital patient advocacy in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nAhead of Biden's rally at the University of Wisconsin, Streit's husband, Ken, a retired law professor, said he liked Biden but wasn't ready to commit to a candidate, saying he'd wait until a year out to start picking favorites. In the middle of Biden's speech, he turned around and said, \"I changed my mind.\" Afterward, he explained.\n\n\"I wasn't sure when I came here that he was gonna run. This was basically announcing that he's going to run. I've never heard a speech clearer without, minus the words 'I declare my candidacy.' This was a declaration that he's going to run,\" Streit said. \"I can't imagine a more positive candidate coming forward in the next two years. I think he really has a lot of capacity to unify the country and to lead us into positive directions. So that's why I would vote for him.", "Bill Richardson is a former Congressman, Ambassador to the United Nations, US Energy Secretary and Governor for the State of New Mexico. He founded the Richardson Center for Global Engagemen t in 2011. Paul Burke manages the election reference site VoteWell.net, focused on deterring and recovering from cyber-attacks. He was an election supervisor in Bosnia for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and analyzes election security in t he August Journal of Physical Security . The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Last summer, at the DefCon hacking conference in Las Vegas, it took hackers less than one day to infiltrate five different types of electronic voting machines. The hackers told reporters that breaking into the machines didn't involve much \"hacking\" at all. Sometimes a simple Google search revealed passwords that unlocked the administrative functions of the machines.\n\nConsider this as we approach Tuesday's midterm elections. The political map shows many tight races, including 73 House races that are classified as \" highly competitive .\" Despite this bitter, politically charged environment, election security can and should be a bipartisan issue. Voters from all parties -- in the midterms and in every election to come -- deserve to feel secure that their votes are counted and that results are accurate.\n\nBut the threat to our elections persists, as we have already seen this election cycle. The Department of Homeland Security announced last month that there had been a number of cyberattackers seeking to gain entry into election databases leading up to the midterms.\n\nAnd there is irrefutable evidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and our intelligence agencies are on high alert for any attempts to interfere in the midterms. There is a lack of coordination between intelligence agencies, however, and the continuing failure of too many elected officials to acknowledge the problem. We owe voters more than this.\n\nIn order for voters to have confidence that their votes are counted and that the result is an honest one, we need to be able to catch problems. Election officials have to defend every machine. Adversaries only need to infect one.\n\nMost counties use paper ballots. It is by far the most hacking-immune voting method . As Governor of New Mexico, I standardized paper balloting in all 33 counties of our state to improve the public trust in our election system. But moving to paper balloting is only a first step and sometimes it leads to a false sense of security. There is no use in having a paper trail if no one checks it.\n\nThousands of election machines across the country count paper ballots. Election machines are computers, however, so they can be hacked. They can be hacked when they get annual updates, when they sit at polling places before an election, and when thumb drives move election results between the machines and the web.\n\nThese weaknesses will let hackers leak in, somewhere, sometime. Adversaries can be local crooks, hostile foreign governments, or international criminals.\n\nHumboldt County , California, and seven Florida counties have a good defense. They scan all ballots and they tally the scans to get fresh, independent election results. Vermont's Secretary of State does the same in six towns chosen at random. This independent scanning and tallying doubles the defense against hackers and is much more affordable than hand-counting. In Humboldt County, when the nonprofit Elections Transparency Project began verifying election results in 2008, it found a discrepancy between the scanned and tallied ballots of 197 ballots, but project representatives report that they aren't finding bigger discrepancies now.\n\nOther counties in California, Florida, and about half the states hand-count ballots in 1% to 3% of precincts. This approach, then, has a 1% to 3% chance of catching a hacked precinct, or 0% if someone can leave that precinct out of the hat when the random sample is drawn. Most of these states only check a few races. In California, ballots arriving after Election Day are not checked at all -- indeed, almost half the states do not check at all. We cannot catch election errors if we are not looking for them.\n\nWe can and must check more. Counties can hire a scanning and tallying company, as Florida and Vermont do, or use open-source software as Humboldt County does. Programmers need to adapt this open-source software to local ballots. It is also important to ensure the scans are accurate by checking a good sample against the original paper ballots.\n\nElection software and contracting companies can be hacked. VR Systems was hacked in 2016 . It manages voter lists and election results . A Putin associate owns most of ByteGrid , which hosts Maryland's election website. Other election contractors may have dubious owners too. Staff at Election Systems & Software (ES&S) had their passwords and email addresses leak onto the web. The CIA, NSA, and big Silicon Valley companies have been hacked, so no one is immune.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBallot storage also needs an upgrade . The main risks to stored ballots have been from insiders, so storage rooms need multiple locks and security systems, with keys held by independent officials. Another approach is to scan ballots daily, as Leon County, Florida does, and seal a digital copy in a safe deposit box. We can reach ballot security if we check tallies, and build lifeboats, such as scanning and tallying independently.\n\nIt seems as if our country is divided on every issue. The preservation of the integrity of our elections is one issue that Republicans and Democrats could work together on. Certainly we can agree on that.", "(CNN) Here's a look at the equinox.\n\nThe equinox occurs twice a year when the sun is directly above the Earth's equator and day and night are of equal length.\n\nFacts:\n\nMarch 20, 2019 - The The vernal equinox begins at approximately 21:58 UTC.\n\nSeptember 23, 2019 - The autumnal equinox begins at approximately 07:50 UTC.\n\nCalendar:\n\nThe vernal equinox occurs in the Northern Hemisphere on March 19, 20 or 21.

Old cries of \"don't believe the polls\" became fevered shouts. And the president has encouraged distrust by calling certain polls \"fake\" and claiming they are used to \"suppress\" the vote.\n\nThat's not true. But there is persistent and widespread suspicion about polling, according to, you guessed it, a McClatchy-Marist poll. And it exists on both sides, albeit in different forms.\n\n\"I think Democrats may have felt let down by the polls but don't think it was an intentional error. I think many Republicans believe the polling errors of 2016 were intentional,\" GOP pollster and co-founder of Echelon Insights Kristen Soltis Anderson told CNN.\n\nSo can the industry regain trust?\n\nSince 2016 there's been a whole lot of self-reflection in the polling world. Pollsters have tweaked their techniques; pundits have become more cautious when talking about polls; and news outlets have conducted some fascinating experiments.\n\nOn Tuesday, all the efforts are being put to the test.\n\n\"Some pollsters would disagree with this, but the way that the public generally views whether or not polling is accurate is whether or not it gets the results of the election right,\" CNN analyst Harry Enten said on \"Reliable Sources.\"\n\n\"I'm not necessarily sure that's fair,\" Enten said, \"but I do think that there is more pressure on pollsters this year to get it right given the president's rhetoric and given what happened in 2016.\"\n\nMany, though not all, 2016 polls underestimated support for Trump. This effect was particularly pronounced at the state level, where there were embarrassing \"misses,\" showing Hillary Clinton with safe leads in states Trump actually carried.\n\nMost national polls accurately showed Clinton winning the popular vote. But reporters and commentators made lots of mistakes in their interpretations of the polls. Readers and viewers did, too. Many people discounted the margin and other factors and made faulty assumptions that Trump would lose to Clinton.\n\nThere were other problems, too. Predictive features on websites gained lots of traffic before the election but caused lots of consternation afterward. HuffPost's model infamously showed Clinton with a 98 percent chance of winning. \"We blew it,\" the site admitted afterward.\n\nBut just as importantly, HuffPost's Natalie Jackson tried to explain why\n\nOther news outlets have also tried to be more transparent and remind voters of what polls cannot convey.\n\nIn special elections since 2016, Democrats have repeatedly outperformed polls of their races.\n\nThe top example was the Virginia governors' race. \"Ralph Northam was favored by three points. He ended up winning by nine,\" Enten said.\n\nBut past outcomes are not an indicator of future results.\n\n\"I think many pollsters and forecasters have tried to be much more intentional about explaining uncertainty and being humble about what data can and can't tell us,\" Anderson said. \"Because I think there was a big sense that in 2016, there was more certainty conveyed than may have been justified by the available data.\"\n\nSo political pros and reporters are communicating poll results differently this time. Time magazine's Molly Ball, who has a no-predictions rule for herself, said that even people who do make predictions are adding more caveats: There's \"less of the, 'Well, the needle shows this' and more of, 'Here's what it doesn't show, here's what we should always remember can happen about probabilities.'\"\n\nEarly voting has been explosive in the midterms, indicating above-average enthusiasm among both Democrats and Republicans. Pollsters have to make assumptions about turnout when contacting \"likely voters,\" and this is a difficult election to forecast.\n\nThe 2018 electorate is \"a universe that doesn't exist yet,\" Democratic pollster Margie Omero said. \"I mean, people don't know whether they're going to vote, some people.\"\n\nThey may tell a pollster that they're sure to vote, but never make it to the ballot box. Or they might change who they're voting for.\n\nConversely, certain subsets of voters may have a big impact on the final results without really showing up in the pre-election polling. If pollsters assume relatively low youth turnout, but lots of young people vote for the first time, that could cause big surprises in certain races.\n\nThe vast majority of people who are called by pollsters decline to participate, so the researchers have to make a huge number of phone calls, bend over backwards to reach a representative sample of people, and weight their results accordingly.\n\nSome polls are higher quality than others. Most news outlets tend to favor live interviewers, as opposed to computerized systems, and a mix of landline and cell phone calls. But some outlets are wading into web-based polling. CNN's polling standards preclude reporting on web polls.\n\nThis fall The New York Times pulled back the curtain by conducting \"live polling\" and publishing the results in real time, call by call. Working with Siena College, the surveyors made 2,822,889 calls and completed 96 polls of House and Senate races.\n\n\"We wanted to demystify polling for people,\" said Nate Cohn of The Times' Upshot blog.\n\n\"From our point of view, it's almost a miracle how accurate polls usually are, given all the challenges,\" Cohn said in an interview with CNN.\n\nHe emphasized that polls are \"very fuzzy things.\" And the real time polling showed this to the public. The researchers sought to interview about 500 people for each race that was examined.\n\nIn Iowa's fourth congressional district , for example, 14,636 calls resulted in 423 interviews.\n\nThe results showed the incumbent, far-right congressman Steve King, with 47% support, and his Democratic challenger J.D. Scholten with 42%.\n\nThe Times characterized this as a \"slight edge\" for King, with lots of room for error. \"The margin of sampling error on the overall lead is 10 points, roughly twice as large as the margin for a single candidate's vote share,\" the Times explained on its website.\n\nCohn's final pre-election story noted that \"even modest late shifts among undecided voters or a slightly unexpected turnout could significantly affect results.\"\n\nThat's the kind of language that lots of polling experts are incorporating into their stories and live shots, especially in the wake of the 2016 election.\n\n\"With polling, you never actually get to the truth,\" Cohn said. \"You inch towards it, and you think you end up within plus or minus 5 points of it at the end.\"\n\nAs Enten put it, \"polls are tools,\" not meant to be perfect. But that message needs to be reinforced through the news media.", "(CNN) Here's a look at the National Hockey League (NHL) All-Star Game.\n\nJanuary 26, 2019 - The NHL All-Star Game is scheduled to take place at SAP Center in San Jose, California.\n\nJanuary 28, 2018 - The NHL All-Star Game takes place at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida.

It also comes as Defense Secretary James Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, are engaged in high-level classified discussions with senior commanders around the world about how to allocate military resources for the next two years, officials say.\n\nIt's unknown publicly what exactly Gen.

The Journal cited sources who said the company often paid for the visits of \"many attendees.\"\n\nUnder Armour told the Journal that Plank didn't conduct business at strip clubs or use company funds at such venues.\n\nThe paper's investigation into the culture at the sportswear company is based on interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees and executives. The strip club visits were part of a workplace environment that women at the company found demeaning, the Journal found.\n\nUnder Armour has partnerships with several prominent female athletes, including ballerina Misty Copeland and ski racer Lindsey Vonn.\n\nIn a statement, the company said it has \"addressed these serious allegations of the past and will continue to address workplace behavior that violates our policies.\"\n\n\"Inappropriate behavior that challenges our values or violates our policies is unacceptable \u2014 and will not be tolerated,\" the company said. \"We are committed to providing a respectful and inclusive workplace.\"\n\nRival sportswear company Nike ( NKE ) has also grappled with claims that the company's work environment has been demeaning to women. In August, two women who worked at Nike filed a lawsuit accusing the company of systemic gender discrimination.\n\nHere is the full letter that Plank and Frisk sent to employees Monday:\n\nDear UA Teammates,\n\nLeadership means that when faced with scrutiny, criticism or accusations - the most important question to ask is if it's deserved. At Under Armour, we own our truth.\n\nWe are writing to you today in response to an article that was published by the Wall Street Journal, which alleges specific instances of inappropriate workplace behavior and a challenging environment. This was tough to read. This is not the culture we envision for Under Armour.\n\nWe believe that there is systemic inequality in the global workplace and will embrace this opportunity to accelerate the ongoing meaningful cultural transformation that is already underway at Under Armour. We can and will do better.\n\nYou deserve to work in a respectful and empowering environment. Inappropriate behavior that challenges our values or violates our policies is unacceptable - and will not be tolerated. We believe that our diversity and collective decency will drive our future.\n\nGreater than the professional talent and expertise that you bring to Under Armour is who you are as an individual - your heart, your values, your story. Your voice is critical and we continue to listen humbly and act decisively. We can't protect this house if we are not protecting each other. This is leadership's first priority and responsibility.\n\nOur culture and values define us. Period. Over the past few years, we've designed and delivered a number of signature programs including our onboarding and leadership development courses, unconscious bias training, Culture Clubs, and our Diversity Driving Innovation platform. As we further strengthen this foundation and learn from the thoughtful work being executed already across our global organization, your leadership team remains steadfastly committed to:\n\n* Enabling a work environment that allows you to be your best;\n\n* Embracing and enforcing policies and protocols to improve the workplace;\n\n* Providing safe, confidential channels (Teammate Resource Guide) to identify inappropriate behavior you experience, hear about or witness;\n\n* Addressing inappropriate behavior swiftly and resolutely; and,\n\n* Using Teammate Engagement Survey results to identify and activate specific, goal-oriented actions to strengthen our culture.\n\nOur mission, Under Armour Makes You Better, is an ethos that spans significantly beyond shirts and shoes.

But all of them will show whether the collective frustration of college-educated voters -- particularly women -- as well as the anger of young and minority voters will serve as a check on Trump and the Republican lock on power in Washington.\n\nOne central question is whether Trump's attempts to whip up his base by vilifying immigrants and refugees in the final weeks will harm vulnerable House incumbents by alienating college-educated whites and energizing Latino voters, who make up 21% of the electorate in California. In the Golden State, Trump's strategy could have mixed results.\n\nIt might be helpful to the GOP, for example, in California-25, the suburban-rural district in northern Los Angeles County where 31-year-old Katie Hill is attempting to unseat Rep. Steve Knight, a veteran and former police officer. But farther south, the President's rhetoric might hurt GOP incumbents like Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters, who both represent more affluent, college-educated areas of Orange County.\n\n\"Trump's final, very divisive, very shrill message on immigration and race is more broadly meant to help Republicans with blue-collar whites, but is clearly reinforcing their problems with white-collar whites,\" said CNN Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein.\n\n\"The way that plays out in California is that it might help Knight in a district where only about a third of white voters have a college degree, but it's much more challenging for Dana Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters because in their districts about half of all the whites have a college degree.\"\n\nIn the state's June primary, Trump clearly had an impact. There was a substantial increase in turnout in heavily Latino precincts in two of the closest races in Orange County -- CA-39 and CA-48 -- according to an analysis by the UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Initiative.\n\nDuring the final sprint this past weekend, Gavin Newsom -- who is vying to be the President's antagonist in chief, as well as the state's next governor -- mocked the President's strategy of stoking fear about the migrant caravan and issued a challenge to progressive voters as he barnstormed the state.\n\nStanding alongside US Sen. Kamala Harris, who might challenge Trump for the White House in 2020, Newsom invoked her signature line in the Trump resistance that America is \"better than this.\"\n\n\"Send a message to Donald Trump, and those who support Trumpism, that we reject it,\" Newsom told voters at a rally for Democrat Katie Porter, who is attempting to unseat Walters in the onetime Republican bastion of Orange County. \"That we're Californians. That we, in the spirit of Kamala Harris, are better than this. It's our state. It's our country. It's our moment.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, the former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and a CNN political commentator, noted that having Newsom and US Sen. Dianne Feinstein at the top of the ticket could also boost Democratic hopes.\n\n\"There's an updraft that's going to help Democratic candidates,\" Axelrod said. \"You add to that the antipathy toward Trump in California and it is a very unforgiving environment for Republican candidates.\"\n\nHere are some of the key races to watch Tuesday night:\n\nCalifornia-10: Rep. Jeff Denham (R) vs. Josh Harder (D)\n\nDenham has survived tough races in this Central Valley district, but now he is confronting the headwinds of Trump's immigration policy and unpopular tariffs that have caught farmers in the midst of a trade war with China. This year he is also facing a remarkably well-funded opponent in Harder, a former Silicon Valley venture capitalist. Harder raised an eye-popping $3.5 million in the third quarter as part of what the Congressional Leadership Fund (the Paul Ryan-backed super PAC) has dubbed this year's \"green wave\" for Democrats.\n\nCalifornia-25: Rep. Steve Knight (R) vs. Katie Hill (D)\n\nKatie Hill\n\nThis complex district north of Los Angeles -- with its blend of suburban and rural areas and a rapidly diversifying population that is nearly 40% Latino -- is one of the night's wild cards. Knight, an Army veteran who worked as a police officer in the district for 18 years, comes from a well-known political family. But his challenger, 31-year-old Hill, is one of the Democratic Party's new stars this cycle: the blunt-talking daughter of a police officer, who made it known that she's owned guns her whole life and filmed one of her campaign commercials while free-climbing a 100-foot rock wall. Supported by EMILY's List and the LGBTQ Victory Fund, Hill was one of the fundraising standouts this cycle. It remains to be seen whether her party can turn out enough Latinos to get her across the finish line.\n\nCalifornia-39: Young Kim (R) vs. Gil Cisneros (D)\n\nYoung Kim\n\nThis district will test the Republican Party's ability to prevail in racially diverse Orange and Los Angeles counties. With her deep ties to the district, Kim is a charismatic potential successor to her onetime boss, retiring Rep. Ed Royce. Born in South Korea, she has highlighted her immigrant journey in a district that is now more than a third Latino and 29% Asian. But elevated turnout among Latinos could help Cisneros, a former Navy officer. In the primary, the number of ballots cast in some majority-Latino precincts in CA-39 were up by as much as 245% over 2014 levels, according to UCLA's analysis.\n\nCalifornia-45: Rep. Mimi Walters (R) vs. Katie Porter (D)\n\nIt initially seemed unlikely that UC Irvine law professor Porter, who Republicans thought they could label as an ultra-liberal prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, could dispatch the well-liked Walters in Orange County. But in a district with high numbers of college-educated voters, Porter has drilled Walters for supporting Trump's agenda much of the time and has played up the California-specific downsides of the Republican tax bill, which Walters supported. As a single mom of three children, Porter has kept her focus squarely on health care and her promise to advocate for the middle class.\n\nCalifornia-48: Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R) vs. Harley Rouda (D)\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher\n\nFor many months, veteran Congressman Rohrabacher barely mounted a campaign in his coastal Orange County district, counting on his long-standing ties to voters here and his quirky reputation as \"Surfin' Dana\" to carry the day. In the third quarter, he raised $421,000 to Rouda's $3.2 million. Rouda, a progressive former Realtor and businessman, has sought to capitalize on disdain for Trump among the district's many college-educated voters. But this race remains a toss-up to the end, with Trump tweeting praise Monday for how Rohrabacher has delivered for his district, and the congressman urging supporters to #VoteRedToSaveAmerica.\n\nCalifornia-49: Diane Harkey (R) vs. Mike Levin (D)\n\nThis race for retiring Rep. GOP Darrell Issa's seat was once thought to be among the most contested in California, but this coastal district in what was once Nixon country in Orange and northern San Diego counties now appears to be tilting blue. Former Board of Equalization candidate Harkey, endorsed by Issa, has been weighed down by family financial scandal and distaste for Trump among the district's many wealthy, college-educated voters. Environmental attorney Levin has run an energetic shoe-leather campaign, with an eye toward activating younger voters. He has cast Harkey as a \"rubber stamp\" for Trump, and opened a double-digit advantage over her in the New York Times/Siena College poll late last month.\n\nCalifornia-50: Rep.

Getty Images\n\nEvery late July to mid-September, Bariloche fills to the brim with both tourists from the southern hemisphere (mostly Brazilians) and northern hemisphere travelers looking for their \"endless winter\" powder fix.\n\nTwenty kilometers from downtown Bariloche is the ski resort of Cerro Catedral, featuring a vertical drop of 1000 meters, close to 1500 skiable acres and 38 lifts.\n\nFor snow sports enthusiasts who don't want to travel heavy, there are several gear rental shops at the foot of the mountain (La Base is one of the most friendly and helpful), and Scandinavian in Bariloche town center can outfit you with clothing for any outdoor adventure.\n\nCatedral, also known as South America's Tahoe, has a booming ski village with loads of nightlife. Many skiers and snowboarders walk over to the casual Berlina microbrewery right after the lifts close, to get the apres-ski rolling with homemade pizzas and an enticing array of craft beers.\n\nRelated content At the end of world lies the adventure of Ushuaia\n\nFor those who would rather explore the mountain by trekking rather than on skis, Bariloche offers everything from short walks to waterfalls to one-day hikes to excruciating-yet-rewarding multi-day treks.\n\nThe majority of trails interlink the refugios (mountain huts).\n\nFrey is the most popular day trek because of its relative ease and spectacular views, but that means that the trails can get crowded. Refugios Lopez, Cerro Lindo and Laguna Negra can also be reached by beginner to intermediate hikers on a one-day hike and are less crowded.\n\nExperienced trekkers wanting the best views in the region may want to undertake the epic 50 kilometer trek from Pampa Linda to Colonia Suiza. It's best to go in January to assure that the passes will be accessible.\n\nBut there's more than just skiing. Water sports aficionados will be happy to know that they can explore the Rio Manso close to Bariloche. Extremo Sur offers guided trips for both beginners and experienced paddlers.\n\nThe part of the Manso closest to the border of Chile offers the most exciting rapids and requires passengers to be at least 14 years old. The Manso Inferior is more calm, perfect for families with younger children (ages 5 and up) or for inexperienced rafters. For those looking for a more quirky adventure, Extremo Sur also offers stand up rafting -- its version of SUP for rapids.\n\nKitesurfing in the past decade has become a booming sport on Lago Nahuel Huapi. Even, steady winds, safe shorelines and kilometers of water with snow-capped Andes in the background make for a perfect playground.\n\nThere are many spots on the lake well-suited for kite surfing, including Bahia Serena, Playa Bonita and Bariloche Classic, but Varadero Beach is the local favorite. Dina Huapi just outside of town also offers two launches: Dina Huapi West and Dina Huapi Rivermouth. The water in both spots is a couple of degrees warmer than in other parts, so it is a better fit for beginners. Happy Riding Surf School can arrange private classes.\n\nFor travelers who want to experience the gorgeous nature of northern Patagonia in style, Constellations is a local travel design agency that crafts unforgettable and unique adventures. (They can set up a private luxury Bedouin-style tent for guests in the middle of some of the most spectacular scenery that Argentina has to offer.)\n\nThey can help arrange almost any adventure imaginable -- yacht charters, classic car tours of the region, exclusive picnics and heliskiing in some of the most pristine powder around.

MARIO GOLDMAN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAll of the incredible hiking in the nearby Andes draws backpackers from all over the world. Travelers on a shoestring budget who want to stay in town will most likely end up on the hostel-filled street called Salta.\n\nAlthough most budget options in town offer the same generic experience, Periko's Hostel on Morales Street is the best bet.\n\nAccommodations may be simple, but it's just 300 meters from the town center and four kilometers from the main long-distance bus terminal. It's staffed by genuinely warm hosts who can help guests secure transfers to both Cerro Catedral for skiing and the trailhead for the popular Frey trek.\n\nFamilies traveling with children should check out Villa Huanid. Just two kilometers outside of town center, this hotel complex is situated high on a hill, offering privileged views of the lake from all around.\n\nThere are three options to choose from here: the more affordable Pioneros complex, the slightly more upscale (but never pretentious) Bustillo complex and private cabins with lots of green space for kids to run around in. There's an arcade room with foosball, heated pools and casual dining options, making this a place where guests can relax with kids of all ages.\n\nAnd for travelers who want to give their children an educational experience with the kids barely noticing they are getting cultured, the Museo de Chocolate is just down the road.\n\nRelated content 16 of the world's best coastlines\n\nOne of the most cozy and romantic options in town is Charming Luxury Lodge, perfect for a couples' getaway. The suites have bathrooms that are more like a professional spa -- eachis equipped with a massive jacuzzi tub overlooking the lake, a dry sauna and a steam room shower complete with a pack of various therapeutic essential oils to place into the hot vapor outlet.\n\nThere is an outdoor heated pool with stunning views of the lake, and one of the most acclaimed restaurants in town, Stag, right on site. Butterfly restaurant less than a 5-minute walk away.\n\nCouples of all orientations will feel welcomed at Charming, as it is proudly a LGBT-friendly establishment. Argentina is one of the foremost destinations in the world for international gay tourism because they were one of the first countries to legalize gay marriage, and Charming is one of the top attractions for those honeymoons.\n\nLlao Llao is one of the region's most famous and popular hotels. Llao Llao\n\nNo mention of Bariloche would be complete without at least a nod to Llao Llao hotel.\n\nOpened in 1940, it recently underwent renovations and is currently acknowledged as a Leading Hotel of the World , which puts it in prestigious company. A stay at this hotel is a bit like visiting a higher-end version of the resort in \"Dirty Dancing\" -- there are numerous scheduled group activities per day such as yoga, archery and stand up paddle boarding.\n\nThe hotel features an 18-hole golf course that showcases 360-degree views of Nahuel Huapi National Park. In fact, many day-trippers visit the hotel just to get a glimpse of the stunning views from the resort or to dine at one of the four restaurants on site.\n\nRenowned head chef Federico Gaston Dominguez Fontan oversees the gastronomy. Whether dining on perfectly-grilled local lamb or enjoying high tea in the Winter Garden Room, the food is definitely a highlight of any stay here.\n\nFor those who want to get out of town and deeper into nature, Peuma Hue is ideal. Set on over 400 acres at the end of Gutierrez Lake, around 30 minutes from Bariloche, this mountain estancia is an idyllic getaway for families or couples.\n\nSome of the best hiking and kayaking in the Lakes Region can be done right from this eco-resort. Guests can walk to waterfalls, explore ancient forests or meander the organic gardens filled with the fresh fruits and vegetables used in the restaurant.

Blest/Facebook\n\nFor casual pub grub both right in town and on Km. 13 down the shoreline, Blest has you covered.\n\nThis relaxed restaurant/brewery is both chill enough to take kids there, and social enough for a fun adult night out on the town. While microbrews are just recently coming into huge popularity in Argentina, Blest was well ahead of the times when it started making beer here 30 years ago.\n\nFood portions here are generous (the lamb burger and the fajitas are notable). New visitors should try out a sample tasting to get to know multiple beers including their Pilsen, Cream Stout, Scotch Ale, cider and a delicious IPA.

This place is great for a casual date night or a nice evening with friends, and it won't break the bank.\n\nButterfly is arguably Bariloche's most renowned gourmet restaurant and any self-respecting foodie needs to give this place a try when in town. The impeccably-designed interior is both homey and modern, with a fireplace and massive windows overlooking Lake Nahuel Huapi. There's only a handful of tables, which makes having a reservation a must.\n\nThey offer a tasting menu of seven interesting courses, which includes a good range of both local and international dishes. (Chef Andres Lopez trained in Europe and his dishes have Spanish and French influence.)\n\nEach plate is paired with an ideal Argentine wine for that dish, and the wines offered are as top notch as the food. While each portion size is small, guests will not leave hungry in the end.\n\nThis is a perfect spot for a romantic evening or to celebrate a last meal in Bariloche.\n\n(A note on prices: Argentina has one of the highest inflation rates in the world, and the prices can vary wildly.

Such protections include the right to be notified about hearings or the release of the accused, the right to restitution or the right to refuse an interview or deposition at the request of the accused.\n\nSupporters of Marsy's Law say it gives victims more say in what happens in their cases. Opponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union , said victims already have these types of rights through state laws and warned that enshrining victims' rights in state constitutions creates a false equivalency between them and the rights of the accused. They warn that Marsy's Law could undermine the rights of the accused and divert resources from those in need.\n\nWashington state's initiative 940 would change the legal standard for use of deadly force in officer-involved shootings.

Maj. Gen. Burke Whitman, a reservist, is expected to begin briefing the Pentagon press corps on camera from now on, something that has not happened since May.\n\nA general is now being selected to fill this newly created job for one basic reason, officials say. Both Mattis and the White House had recently been dissatisfied with Pentagon briefings and wanted a much higher military profile in the on-camera briefings. Several officials say Mattis and the White House wanted a military figure to act as spokesperson.\n\nUp until May, chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana White had conducted the briefings and though she will remain in her role, she is not expected to brief on camera on a regular basis. She has told other officials her schedule of increased travel with the secretary no longer allows her time for briefings. CNN reported in August that White was under investigation by the Defense Department Office of Inspector General for allegedly retaliating against staff members after she used some of them to conduct her personal errands and business matters.\n\nPreviously White had briefed jointly on camera with Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, director of the joint staff. But McKenzie generally talked only about military operations and did not answer questions on policy matters. He also did not have the title of uniformed spokesman.\n\nThe decision to appoint Whitman is controversial because the military is supposed to remain outside the political arena, and with a member of the military acting as spokesperson reporters will not be able to ask questions about political aspects of decision making.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) The election is today!

CNN's new election-eve poll shows independent voters breaking for Democrats in the midterms, 53 to 39% -- a 14-point margin. That's in line with independents' shift toward Democrats in the wave-election of 2006 and Republicans in the 2010 Tea Party wave -- and it's another indication of independents' preference for the checks and balances that come from divided government.\n\nThis final-stretch focus is a reminder that independents are the balance of power in American politics. But their influence is diluted by Washington's obsession with politics that play to the base. As the two parties have become more ideologically polarized over the past three decades, independent voters have grown from about 35% of the electorate in 1990 to averaging about 42% this year, while Democrats and Republicans hover just south of the 30% mark.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump voter: Afraid of dictator in White House Replay More Videos ...

Center-right senators like Republicans Jeff Flake and Bob Corker were essentially forced into retirement because of their principled criticisms of President Trump, which made partisan primaries seem like losing bets, despite their being strong general election candidates.\n\nUnfortunately for the nation, both men chose not to pursue the path that Alaska's Senator Lisa Murkowski did in 2006, when she successfully persisted with an independent candidacy after losing a primary to a Tea Partier. Centrist Democrats like West Virgina Senator Joe Manchin are in a stronger position in their party, but the energy is increasingly from candidates on the left adopting more liberal positions -- like Medicare for All.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, more candidates are trying their hand at independent candidacies. In Kansas, independent Greg Orman is running in a three-way race for governor after nearly winning a Senate seat as an independent in 2014.

But with this polarization likely to get worse in the coming years, independents' ambitious efforts might simply be ahead of their time. Breaking through this bitter and divisive climate will ultimately require new coalitions to depolarize our politics.\n\nIndependent voters and candidates are rebelling against the rigid polarization of our politics.

Now he wants to fix it.\n\nBerners-Lee on Monday revealed a new campaign called \"Contract for the Web\" at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal. The campaign promotes principles for governments, companies and citizens to improve the internet and fight back against hate speech, privacy concerns and political manipulation.\n\n\"Those of us who are online are seeing our rights and freedoms threatened,\" he said in a statement announcing the project, which was organized by his nonprofit the World Wide Web Foundation. Berners-Lee added that the contract outlines \"clear and tough responsibilities\" for those with the power to make the internet a better place.\n\nMore than 50 companies and organizations, including Facebook ( FB ), Google ( GOOGL ) and the French government have signed the contract, which will be published in full in May 2019.\n\nSo far, the contract includes nine principles. It asks that governments ensure all citizens can connect to the internet, that companies respect consumers' privacy and personal data and that citizens create \"rich and relevant content for everyone.\"\n\nGiving people control over their own data will benefit everyone, Berners-Lee told CNN Business' Senior Tech Correspondent Laurie Segall in Lisbon.\n\n\"A lot of companies are finding it so exciting to be able to switch from trying to exploit you, trying to make you buy something you didn't want to buy, to actually switch back to the core business model of helping the user [and] generating value for the user,\" he said.\n\nPersonal data isn't as valuable to companies as one might expect, he added. \"Maybe it's a myth,\" Berners-Lee said, pushing back on the idea that tech companies need to collect data to be profitable.\n\nAnd people won't just \"hoard\" their data once they have dominion over it, Berners-Lee said. People could still choose to share information with their employers or companies they shop with.\n\n\"The idea of control over your own data is not just about me being my own silo, locking everything away,\" he said. \"It's actually having the joy of being able to share it with whoever.\"\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect that Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, not the internet.", "Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Fifty-two years ago, President Lyndon Johnson warned the nation not to be seduced by proponents of a white backlash. Less than 48 hours before the 1966 midterms, just like today, LBJ saw in the electorate a noxious mix of white anger, hatred and resentment.\n\nBack then, the white backlash had taken form in response to the riots in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles one year earlier as well as to an open housing bill that his administration was trying to push through Congress aimed at eliminating racism in the sale or rental of property.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a televised news conference in Fredericksburg, Texas, on November 6, Johnson read from a prepared statement in which he explained , \"I can think of nothing more dangerous, more divisive, or more self-destructive than the effort to prey on what is called 'white backlash.' I thought it was a mistake to pump this issue up in the 1964 campaign, and I do not think it served the purpose of those who did. I think it is dangerous because it threatens to vest power in the hands of second-rate men whose only qualification is their ability to pander to other men's fears. I think it divides this nation at a very critical time -- and therefore it weakens us as a united country.\"\n\nThough LBJ had been a product of the South and had opposed civil rights legislation earlier in his career, he had come to fully embrace the cause of civil rights with a religious zeal , pushing the Civil Rights Act of 1957 while serving as Senate majority leader and then as President moving the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through the Congress.\n\nThe President, who was frustrated that the accomplishments from his Great Society were at risk in 1966, didn't hold back when speaking to the reporters. \"I think that the so-called 'white backlash' is destructive, not only of the interests of Negro Americans, but of all those who stand to gain from humane and farsighted government. And those that stand to gain from humane and farsighted government is everybody. Nevertheless, there are those who try to stimulate suspicion into hatred, and to make fear and frustration their springboard into public office. Many of them do it openly. Some let their henchmen do it for them. Their responsibility is the same.\"\n\nJohnson warned that, \"Racism -- whether it comes packaged in the Nazi's brown shirt or a three-button suit -- destroys the moral fiber of a nation. It poisons public life. So I would urge every American to ask himself before he goes to the polls on Tuesday: Do I want to cast my vote on the basis of fear? Do I want to follow the merchants of bigotry?\"\n\nLBJ had his eye on the backlash that was taking place in many parts of the country, with special concern for Georgia, where Democrat Lester Maddox was running against Republican Bo Callaway for governor with naked appeals to angry whites. Maddox, who had received the support of the KKK, was famous for having waved a pistol at three African-American Georgia Tech students who he chased away from his whites-only restaurant, the Pickrick Restaurant, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nUnfortunately, too many parts of the nation didn't listen to LBJ's warning, and we are still paying the price. The midterms -- which drew a record-high midterm turnout of 49% -- didn't go well for the administration. Although Democrats still controlled the House and Senate, Republicans had gained 47 seats in the House and three seats in the Senate. The GOP did well in Democratic bastions like Chicago, where some white, ethnic, working-class voters responded to the demagogues who warned that their property was at risk.\n\nThe conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans who had blocked progress on liberal legislation since 1938, who suffered a major setback in LBJ's landslide victory in 1964, were back in full force. Conservatives also did well in state races, including Maddox who won in Georgia -- the state that today is once again ground zero for efforts to roll back the gains of civil rights through voting restrictions.\n\nEven worse, the politics of white backlash did not disappear from the conservative landscape. The partisan appeals continued to white, protestant men, whose fear that the country was changing around them never went away. President Richard Nixon, who returned to the national landscape by campaigning on law and order for Republicans in the 1966 midterms, exploited these fears with his promises for \" law and order \" and a Southern Strategy that aimed to pick up formerly Democratic votes in Dixie by resisting civil rights.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Republican campaign consultant Lee Atwater was a master at using this ploy, most famously with an ad in 1988 about a parole program in Massachusetts -- the home state of Democratic governor Michael Dukakis -- that allowed an African-American prisoner Willie Horton to go free for a weekend during which he escaped and later raped a woman and stabbed her husband. White backlash has continued to flare, such as with the birther campaign in 2011, where Republicans like Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of the first African American president.\n\nFor more opinion...

They tried to build broad coalitions that revolved around issues like anti-communism and tax reductions rather than pure, undiluted hate.\n\nNot this time.

Pero los discursos del Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. y las marchas del movimiento por los derechos civiles me inspiraban esperanza en un futuro m\u00e1s justo y humano.\n\nPudiera relatar muchas otras experiencias de mi vida en Estados Unidos que me hicieron amar a este pa\u00eds, pero s\u00e9 que les puede resultar aburrido y poco interesante. He querido simplemente compartir esta etapa de mi vida para poder explicar mis sentimientos sobre los acontecimientos actuales en este querido pa\u00eds.\n\nNunca sospech\u00e9 ver tanto odio, desuni\u00f3n, violencia, deterioro moral y \u00e9tico de un pa\u00eds que quiero y respeto- No tenemos a nadie a quien culpar de ello pues todos somos responsables de una u otra manera por la terrible situaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica en la que nos encontramos. Pero, si de culpar a alguien se trata, deber\u00edamos comenzar por los l\u00edderes del pa\u00eds de todos los signos pol\u00edticos. Sus discursos, por lo general, alimentan los temores, la violencia y el odio.\n\nEn mi opini\u00f3n, le corresponde a los altos funcionarios de los principales partidos ponerle fin a estas campa\u00f1as y discursos que promueven odio y desconfianza. No menos importante es el decisivo papel que le corresponde a la m\u00e1s alta figura del pa\u00eds: nuestro presidente. Se alega que en sus discursos \u00e9l se dirige solamente a los que le apoyan, para lo cual no deja de insultar y demonizar a todo el que no comparta sus criterios e ideolog\u00eda.\n\nEs cierto que el presidente tiene el derecho a defenderse de ataques injustos o denigrantes, pero cuando acept\u00f3 ser presidente asumi\u00f3 la responsabilidad de ser el l\u00edder de todos los ciudadanos, y no solamente de sus seguidores. Casi el cincuenta por ciento de los potenciales electores no acudieron a las urnas en las elecciones presidenciales de 2016, y la candidata del partido contrario a Trump gan\u00f3 el voto popular. En lugar de sanar las divisiones, de asumir la presidencia con un esp\u00edritu unificador, nuestro presidente ha contribuido a aumentar la divisi\u00f3n, los recelos y rencores. En su primer discurso como presidente declar\u00f3: \u201cHa llegado la hora. Juro a todos los ciudadanos de nuestro pa\u00eds que ser\u00e9 el presidente de todos los estadounidenses, y eso es muy importante para m\u00ed.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.\u201d) A pesar de esa promesa que me hizo pensar que ese juramento sagrado de este presidente ser\u00eda una de sus prioridades, poco a poco pude constatar que era pura ret\u00f3rica. Si esa fue en realidad su intenci\u00f3n, hay que decir que ha fracasado rotundamente.\n\nCreo que todos los presidentes de cualquier pa\u00eds debieran ser la figura que unifica, que traza el camino a seguir por toda la ciudadan\u00eda porque se trata del l\u00edder de todos los ciudadanos. Ser l\u00edder implica tener en cuenta las aspiraciones y opiniones de todos los ciudadanos.\n\nLos l\u00edderes son los que ayudan a su pueblo a hacer historia, y, salvo algunos pasos de avance en el plano econ\u00f3mico, la grandeza de este pa\u00eds se cuestiona por la falta de liderazgo y el deterioro de sus ideales. Me cuesta mucho trabajo escuchar a nuestro presidente cuando improvisa lo que va a decir. Cuando lee los discursos que le preparan sus colaboradores, muchas veces est\u00e1 a la altura de lo que debe decir un l\u00edder, y en esos momentos me siento orgulloso de sus palabras. Todo lo contrario me sucede cuando momentos despu\u00e9s es capaz de declarar que en las filas de neonazis y supremacistas blancos tambi\u00e9n hay gente buena. Haber estudiado, trabajado y vivido en Alemania -y en Nueva York- me permiti\u00f3 conocer a sobrevivientes del holocausto y visitar campos de concentraci\u00f3n. Sus an\u00e9cdotas y las experiencias que viv\u00ed en esos campos de exterminio quedar\u00e1n conmigo hasta mi muerte.\n\nCulpar exclusivamente al presidente Trump por todos los odios y violencia que predominan hoy en el pa\u00eds me parece exagerado. El odio tiene fuertes ra\u00edces y se necesita luchar contra el odio. Pero, en su condici\u00f3n de l\u00edder del pa\u00eds le corresponde sentar las bases para un debate respetuoso y constructivo que nunca se lograr\u00e1 si se alienta a la violencia o se hacen chistes que muchos pueden interpretar como est\u00edmulos a la xenofobia, el racismo, la violencia y tantos otros prejuicios despreciables. Hagamos todos la parte que nos corresponde. Luchemos por la coexistencia que hizo grande a este pa\u00eds. Nuestras generaciones futuras merecen que les leguemos un pa\u00eds unido, respetuoso de la diferencia, multicultural y solidario. Esa es una obligaci\u00f3n de todos, que como nos ense\u00f1\u00f3 el gran Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed tendr\u00e1 que ser \u201ccon todos y para el bien de todos.\u201d\n\nNota: Este art\u00edculo fue publicado en Facebook.", "Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp set off a political firestorm when his office, two days before an election in which he is a candidate, announced that it had opened an investigation into the Georgia Democratic Party in connection with what it described as an attempted hack of the state's voter registration system.", "Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Fifty-two years ago, President Lyndon Johnson warned the nation not to be seduced by proponents of a white backlash. Less than 48 hours before the 1966 midterms, just like today, LBJ saw in the electorate a noxious mix of white anger, hatred and resentment.\n\nBack then, the white backlash had taken form in response to the riots in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles one year earlier as well as to an open housing bill that his administration was trying to push through Congress aimed at eliminating racism in the sale or rental of property.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a televised news conference in Fredericksburg, Texas, on November 6, Johnson read from a prepared statement in which he explained , \"I can think of nothing more dangerous, more divisive, or more self-destructive than the effort to prey on what is called 'white backlash.' I thought it was a mistake to pump this issue up in the 1964 campaign, and I do not think it served the purpose of those who did. I think it is dangerous because it threatens to vest power in the hands of second-rate men whose only qualification is their ability to pander to other men's fears. I think it divides this nation at a very critical time -- and therefore it weakens us as a united country.\"\n\nThough LBJ had been a product of the South and had opposed civil rights legislation earlier in his career, he had come to fully embrace the cause of civil rights with a religious zeal , pushing the Civil Rights Act of 1957 while serving as Senate majority leader and then as President moving the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through the Congress.\n\nThe President, who was frustrated that the accomplishments from his Great Society were at risk in 1966, didn't hold back when speaking to the reporters. \"I think that the so-called 'white backlash' is destructive, not only of the interests of Negro Americans, but of all those who stand to gain from humane and farsighted government. And those that stand to gain from humane and farsighted government is everybody. Nevertheless, there are those who try to stimulate suspicion into hatred, and to make fear and frustration their springboard into public office. Many of them do it openly. Some let their henchmen do it for them. Their responsibility is the same.\"\n\nJohnson warned that, \"Racism -- whether it comes packaged in the Nazi's brown shirt or a three-button suit -- destroys the moral fiber of a nation. It poisons public life. So I would urge every American to ask himself before he goes to the polls on Tuesday: Do I want to cast my vote on the basis of fear? Do I want to follow the merchants of bigotry?\"\n\nLBJ had his eye on the backlash that was taking place in many parts of the country, with special concern for Georgia, where Democrat Lester Maddox was running against Republican Bo Callaway for governor with naked appeals to angry whites. Maddox, who had received the support of the KKK, was famous for having waved a pistol at three African-American Georgia Tech students who he chased away from his whites-only restaurant, the Pickrick Restaurant, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nUnfortunately, too many parts of the nation didn't listen to LBJ's warning, and we are still paying the price. The midterms -- which drew a record-high midterm turnout of 49% -- didn't go well for the administration. Although Democrats still controlled the House and Senate, Republicans had gained 47 seats in the House and three seats in the Senate. The GOP did well in Democratic bastions like Chicago, where some white, ethnic, working-class voters responded to the demagogues who warned that their property was at risk.\n\nThe conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans who had blocked progress on liberal legislation since 1938, who suffered a major setback in LBJ's landslide victory in 1964, were back in full force. Conservatives also did well in state races, including Maddox who won in Georgia -- the state that today is once again ground zero for efforts to roll back the gains of civil rights through voting restrictions.\n\nEven worse, the politics of white backlash did not disappear from the conservative landscape. The partisan appeals continued to white, protestant men, whose fear that the country was changing around them never went away. President Richard Nixon, who returned to the national landscape by campaigning on law and order for Republicans in the 1966 midterms, exploited these fears with his promises for \" law and order \" and a Southern Strategy that aimed to pick up formerly Democratic votes in Dixie by resisting civil rights.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Republican campaign consultant Lee Atwater was a master at using this ploy, most famously with an ad in 1988 about a parole program in Massachusetts -- the home state of Democratic governor Michael Dukakis -- that allowed an African-American prisoner Willie Horton to go free for a weekend during which he escaped and later raped a woman and stabbed her husband. White backlash has continued to flare, such as with the birther campaign in 2011, where Republicans like Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of the first African American president.\n\nFor more opinion...

They tried to build broad coalitions that revolved around issues like anti-communism and tax reductions rather than pure, undiluted hate.\n\nNot this time. President Trump has made white backlash a defining character of his presidency.", "(CNN) The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to take up a case concerning the government's decision to phase out an Obama-era initiative that protects from deportation young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\n\nIn doing so, government lawyers sought to bypass federal appeals courts that have yet to rule definitively on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nIn court papers, Solicitor General Noel Francisco asked the justices to take up the case this term and argued that district judges who had issued opinions against the administration were \"wrong\" to do so. Francisco pointed out that back in 2012 the Obama administration allowed some \"700,000 aliens to remain in the United States even though existing laws provided them no ability to do so.\"\n\nFrancisco said that \"after a change in administrations\" the Department of Homeland Security ended the policy \"based on serious doubts about its legality and the practical implications of maintaining it.\"\n\nThe filing came the night before the midterm elections as President Donald Trump has repeatedly brought up immigration to rally his base in the final hours before the vote.\n\nRead More", "Gayle Tzemach Lemmon is an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. She is the author of \"Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) The life and death of North Ogden, Utah Mayor Brent Taylor, known as Major Brent Taylor in Afghanistan, reminds us of the unifying ideals behind the idea of America and the selfless grace that underlies true service. It is a tragic -- and timely -- reminder.\n\nAmerica is a nation divided and exhausted -- if we doubted it, the run-up to the midterm elections have made this especially clear. Common narratives about what our country should represent seem to fail us. And yet when it comes to Afghanistan, the site of our nation's longest war, there is agreement across the political spectrum that that country is a basket case -- a place where America is \"failing.\"\n\nBut Major Taylor, killed in Afghanistan when a member of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces opened fire this past week, saw things differently. He challenged both the notion that America's division is inevitable and that Afghanistan's future is hopeless.\n\nHis example pushes us to acknowledge that, in America, what we have in common binds us to one another and to our ideals. And his praise for the \"brave Afghan soldiers\" he served with reminds us of the sacrifice that that nation's forces have made for their country.\n\nThat he was killed by a member of the same forces whose bravery he praised is not lost on anyone. But the fact is Maj. Taylor himself spoke highly of so many among those forces; the enormous tragedy of his killing does not undo the high regard in which he held them. Indeed, his family wrote that there is \"heartache but no regret.\"\n\nAnd an Afghan pilot wrote to Taylor's family, praising the man Taylor was and asking them not to see \"the violent act that took his life as representative of us or our sentiments toward Americans.\" \"I assure you that the one who shot him represents evil and violence,\" wrote Abdul Rahman Rahmani . \"On behalf of my family and Brent's friends here in the Special Mission Wing, we pledge to continue to work hard until the end, the day when peace will return to our country and violence and hatred no longer claim the lives of both of our countrymen.\"\n\nTaylor urged us to care about the sacred right to vote and made his work protecting the recent Afghan elections look and sound noble and worthwhile, while highlighting the courage of those he sought to help. And if we take his unselfishness and care for others to heart, we might end up in a place where kindness is not a sign of weakness, but an expression of patriotism.\n\n\"Service is really what leadership is all about,\" Taylor, a father of seven, wrote in a Facebook post this past January while announcing his upcoming deployment, his second to Afghanistan (he had also served two tours in Iraq). And he noted last month, while safeguarding the Afghan elections -- marred by violence and death -- that \"it was beautiful to see over 4 million Afghan men and women brave threats and deadly attacks to vote in Afghanistan's first parliamentary elections in eight years.\"\n\nWrote Taylor, \"the strong turnout, despite the attacks and challenges, was a success for the long-suffering people of Afghanistan and for the cause of human freedom.\" And he remembered his Afghan colleague, \"my dear friend Lieutenant Kefayatullah who was killed fighting the Taliban the day before voting began.\"\n\n\"As the USA gets ready to vote in our own election (Tuesday), I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote,\" Taylor wrote. \"And that whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED US soldier killed in 'insider attack' Replay More Videos ...

But those who have given their careers to these battles have seen a great deal about how the rest of the world works. They are alive to the preciousness of our right to vote. They have seen how key institutions are to protecting individual rights, and how important basic security is to the exercise of democracy.\n\n\"Things are going great over here for our team,\" Taylor wrote on October 17. \"We are working hard with our brave Afghan colleagues and our dedicated NATO allies to help ensure a safe parliamentary election day this weekend, so the people of Afghanistan can choose their leaders in peace.\"\n\nTaylor marveled at the Afghans who risked their lives for their right to vote. He wrote in April \"the dedication of the Afghan soldiers is especially inspiring. There is not a single Afghan soldier I know who has not lost at least one (and often more) father, brother, family member, close friend, etc. in this war. Yet they keep up the fight against a barbaric enemy that stops at nothing (for example, militants murdered 57 innocent civilians at a voting registration center just yesterday).\"\n\nAs Election Day nears, let us remember Taylor's words from January.\n\n\"As my family and I undertake this opportunity to serve our country, I encourage each of you to find some way in 2018 to 'ask not what (our) country can do for (us) (but) what (we) can do for (our) country,'\" Taylor wrote\n\nFor more opinion...

Rick Scott, a Republican hoping to oust Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in one of the marquee Senate races of Tuesday's election . Scott, a former health care executive has poured $51 million of his fortune into the contest, according to data from the center and the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThat's far ahead of the No. 2 self-funder running for Congress, New Jersey Republican Bob Hugin. The former pharmaceutical executive has loaned his campaign $27.5 million. Hugin hopes to knock off two-term Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, in political peril , following a 2017 federal corruption case against him that ended in a mistrial.\n\nMaryland Democrat David Trone, who co-founded a chain of Total Wine & More stores, tops the self-funders seeking House seats. Trone, making his second bid for Congress, has put in just shy of $16 million in the race, according to federal campaign finance records.\n\nThe center's analysis examined House and Senate candidates who raised at least $500,000 and relied on their own funds for at least half their campaign money. It doesn't count state or local races, such as the Illinois governor's contest where Democrat Jay Pritzker has claimed the title of largest self-funder in US history by donating an eye-popping $161.5 million to his campaign.\n\nPritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel chain, faces a multimillionaire Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, a former private-equity executive who also is tapping into his fortune on his re-election bid.\n\nJay Young, executive director of Common Cause Illinois, said the explosion in self-funding \"feels as though if you have enough money, you can capture whatever office you want just off the strength of that money alone.\"\n\n\"It shifts power away from people who should be holding the power -- ordinary voters,\" Young said.\n\nTough road\n\nHistorically, most self-financed candidates haven't succeeded at the ballot box.\n\nFor instance, the previous self-funding record-holder, tech executive Meg Whitman, lost her 2010 bid for California governor to Democrat Jerry Brown by nearly 13 percentage points, despite plowing $144 million of her own money into the race.\n\nOther notable self-funders who faltered include Texas industrialist Ross Perot, who self-financed an independent bid for the presidency in 1992; Linda McMahon, who spent nearly $99 million on back-to-back failed US Senate bids in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012 and Mitt Romney, who put nearly $45 million into his failed 2008 bid for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nBrendan Fischer of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center said asking donors for money helps candidates build a support base.\n\n\"Fundraising requires that a candidate makes appeals to voters and listen to the interests of other people besides themselves,\" he said. \"That can help create the movement necessary to mount a legitimate campaign.\"\n\nSome candidates have bucked the trend, including New Jersey Democrat Jon Corzine whose $60 million accounted for 95% of the money that went into his successful 2010 US Senate campaign.\n\nBIllionaires for president?\n\nTrump, who plowed hefty $66.1 million of his real-estate fortune into the 2016 presidential race, is another notable exception. But his money accounted for just shy of 20% of his total fundraising.\n\nHe also drew legions of donors who contributed in small amounts to back his political ambitions.\n\nNor was he a typical candidate. Trump entered the White House contest in 2015, already famous for his star turn on the \"The Apprentice\" reality-show franchise, and his populist message and brash rhetoric kept him in the spotlight throughout the campaign.\n\nBut his success may have paved the way for other super-wealthy candidates to take a shot the White House.\n\nAt least two Democratic billionaires active in Tuesday's midterms -- the moderate former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and liberal San Francisco hedge-fund founder Tom Steyer -- are weighing 2020 White House bids of their own.\n\nBoth have starred in their own ads , and both have political organizations of their own spending heavily in the midterms to help elect Democrats.\n\nIn an interview Monday with CNN, Steyer said the expense of campaigns and the death of the public-funding system for presidential campaigns have helped contribute to the new breed of candidate.\n\n\"Self-funding takes away one problem,\" Steyer said. But he said campaigns fall flat if candidates don't have a winning message.\n\n\"It doesn't have matter how much money you have,\" he said, \"if you have nothing to say.\"", "(CNN) As Washington awaits a potential reshaping of the political order on Capitol Hill, multiple sources inside and outside the Trump administration tell CNN that an all but certain shakeup is quietly underway at the White House, as President Donald Trump is poised to reshuffle his Cabinet for the second half of his first term.\n\nTrump acknowledged as much on Monday. \"Administrations makes changes, usually, after midterms. And probably we'll be right in that category as well,\" he told reporters at Joint Base Andrews on his way to a rally in Ohio. \"I think it's very customary.\"\n\nThe President has made little secret of his furor at several members of his Cabinet, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the top of the list. His relationship with Defense Secretary James Mattis has steadily faded, with the two talking far less than they did during the first year of Trump's term. And his anger toward Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has bubbled into public view on several occasions, with the President blaming her for failing to solve the intractable challenge of illegal immigration.\n\nAs the halftime mark of his first term approaches, the President is increasingly talking to allies and advisers about the potential for sweeping change in his Cabinet. While as many as half a dozen may end up leaving, three names in particular-- Sessions, Mattis, Nielsen -- are at the top of many internal conversations about the Cabinet secretaries most likely to leave, along with White House chief of staff John Kelly. Another is already on her way out. Last month, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced her intent to leave at the end of the year.\n\nEven so, two White House officials and one outside confidant to the President tell CNN that the changes may be less urgent than many people assume. The timetable may also be dictated by the outcome of the midterm elections. \"No one leaves quickly around here,\" one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations inside the West Wing. \"Even people the President wishes were gone.\"\n\nJeff Sessions\n\nThat especially applies to Sessions, whom Trump has spent months openly ridiculing because of his recusal from the Russia investigation, issuing blistering performance reviews in media interviews and tweets, and even going so far as proclaiming, \" I don't have an attorney general ,\" during an interview with The Hill in September.\n\nFor his part, Sessions has generally declined to spar with the President, choosing instead to keep his head down and go about his job while continuing to support Trump's policies (both privately and publicly). He's also managed to adopt a stoic sense of humor about his situation. To mark the anniversary of his first year in office, staff aides gave Sessions a bulletproof vest as a gag gift. Many Republican lawmakers have said Sessions should stay put. And Trump's attacks haven't gone over well with voters in Alabama, where Sessions remains popular.\n\nStill, Sessions constantly finds himself in the cross-hairs of Trump, most recently during an Axios interview in which the President said Sessions did not give him prior notice before the Justice Department urged a court to throw out provisions in Obamacare that protect pre-existing conditions. Not only is that at odds with Trump's recent rhetoric on the campaign trail promising to protect patients with pre-existing conditions, but Sessions also has said that Trump signed off on the move.\n\nIt's all led to widespread speculation that Sessions could be the first to go. His departure would trigger a complex set of options for the President. If Trump does not immediately name a temporary replacement, then Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the current No. 2 at the Justice Department, would act in Sessions' place. Given that Rosenstein has already stepped into Sessions' shoes to oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, allowing Rosenstein to serve as the acting attorney general until Trump's permanent choice is confirmed could provide the least disruptive path forward.\n\nSenate leadership has privately signaled that another attorney general nominee would not get confirmed during the lame duck session after the midterms, according to a source familiar with the matter, further curtailing Trump's ability to quickly swap out Sessions.\n\nIf Trump opts to tap someone else as acting attorney general in lieu of Rosenstein before Mueller's probe is finished, the political blowback could be strong, especially if the move is perceived as a way to undermine the special counsel's work.\n\nIn the wake of reports that Rosenstein may resign or be fired in late September, Justice officials began planning for Solicitor General Noel Francisco to step in as acting attorney general to oversee Mueller. They also made plans to name Matthew Whitaker, Sessions' current chief of staff, as the acting deputy attorney general. And while Whitaker has spoken with Trump directly about his future at the Justice Department, reportedly even contemplating taking his boss's job , the White House has been informed that he too would likely have to recuse from the Russia investigation in light of some of his past writings and TV appearances. Plans of his ascension appear to have stalled. Moreover, there seems to be little appetite for Francisco to assume the acting attorney general slot if Rosenstein remains in place for now.\n\nOne Trump ally told CNN that the White House is now looking for someone who is \"not real partisan\" when asked about candidates to permanently replace Sessions. The source acknowledged the swirl of rumors that it might be a sitting lawmaker -- Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has been repeatedly asked about the job. He's also repeatedly said he's not interested.\n\nOther names that have been floated as possible replacements for Sessions include Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas, a former federal prosecutor, as well John Michael Luttig, a former US Court of Appeals judge and Justice Department official, and current general counsel at Boeing. One former White House official said Luttig is a strong possibility. A second source close to Luttig says that he was considered for the role of FBI director after James Comey was fired.\n\nA Hill source also mentioned that federal Judge Edith Jones, who sits on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, might also be in play.\n\nJanice Rogers Brown has also emerged as a possible candidate. Brown, a former California Supreme Court associate justice and former US circuit judge, retired from the bench in August 2017 and moved back to California. A source close to her indicated that she would not be interested in the AG job and doesn't want to return to Washington.\n\nJohn Kelly and Jim Mattis\n\nOne of the biggest dynamics to watch -- and one of the biggest mysteries in Washington -- is between Kelly and Mattis, both retired Marine Corps generals, and whether they have an unspoken agreement to stay as long as possible. Two questions remain unanswered for several people close to the White House: Will they stay on until fired? Or will they resign and let the President shape his team for the next phase of his first term?\n\nIn July, Kelly made a showy declaration that Trump had asked him to remain as chief of staff until 2020, and that he'd agreed. But even that pronouncement did little to quiet speculation -- both inside and outside the White House -- that he could depart at any time.\n\nMattis' future was brought into question most recently after Trump, in a September interview with \"60 Minutes,\" labeled Mattis as \"sort of a Democrat\" while saying the retired general \"may leave\" and that \"at some point, everybody leaves.\"\n\nCNN in recent days has spoken to several current and former officials who have worked directly with and for Mattis. They all say he would not resign because of the sense of duty he feels to the troops. One current senior administration official who works directly with Mattis says the defense secretary still sees himself as a general and that since the troops can't just up and leave, he won't either.\n\nMattis himself pushed back on rumors of his departure, telling reporters while en route to Vietnam recently that Trump had called him following his interview with \"60 Minutes\" and told him, \"I'm 100% with you.\"\n\n\"I'm on his team,\" Mattis told reporters, adding, \"We have never talked about me leaving.\"\n\nOn Monday, Trump directly addressed speculation about Mattis leaving, and denied he had any plans to change his secretary of defense. \"Why would I do that? Is that the new rumor?\" he asked when questioned about changes at the Pentagon. \"No, I don't at all. I was surprised by that question.\"\n\nThe one development that could change that line of thinking by Mattis would be if there were so much interference by the White House that he felt he could not run the Defense Department. These officials who have worked with Mattis say a key hurdle for him will be to convince the President that his ideas are not being slow-rolled at the Pentagon. As one official said, \"That is why you see the deployment of forces\" to the border that the President wants. \"There were the '60 Minutes' comments and now you see Mattis carry out the President's orders.\" On Oct. 31, asked if the President's plan to send thousands of troops to the border amounted to a political stunt, Mattis replied, \"We don't do stunts.\"\n\nSome current and former officials have said that rumors of Mattis falling out of favor with the President are being pushed by allies close to Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton, specifically his deputy Mira Ricardel, who clashed with Mattis while serving in the Trump transition and worked to block some of his choices for key Pentagon posts in the early days of the administration.\n\nBolton has also clashed recently with Kelly, including getting into a West Wing shouting match with him over immigration policy and a recent surge of illegal border crossings.\n\nWhen news of the loud and expletive-laden argument with Bolton emerged, some White House staffers wondered whether Kelly would step down -- a reflection of the continued questions about his status.\n\nThat Bolton felt empowered to raise his voice to Kelly struck some staffers as a sign of Kelly's diminished role. When he took the chief of staff job in July 2017, Kelly insisted that all aides -- even Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- report through him. But new additions to the staff, including Bolton, top economic adviser Larry Kudlow and communications chief Bill Shine, report directly to Trump.\n\nKirstjen Nielsen\n\nThe performance of Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen was at the heart of the fight between Bolton and Kelly, two sources familiar with the argument told CNN at the time. Nielsen is widely viewed as an acolyte of Kelly, whom she served under at the White House and later replaced as secretary of homeland security. Kelly has staunchly defended Nielsen against criticism of her performance on immigration-related matters. He's also been forced to defend her to the President, who has expressed suspicion over the jobs she held in former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nTrump has angrily aired his frustrations with Nielsen's handling of border security during contentious meetings at the White House, claiming she isn't up to the task of fulfilling the campaign promises he made to curb illegal immigration. That, in turn, has led to an internal dynamic where some officials have griped to the President about Nielsen's performance in order to gain favor with him.\n\nThe President has not sought to quell that dynamic, believing that pitting camps of aides against each other is a way to produce better results. But the constant arrows have led Nielsen to tell some associates that she is unhappy in her post, leading some to believe she could be out of office as soon as the end of the year, according to one current and one former Department of Homeland Security official. The former official expects the decision will be mutual and that she will go to the private sector.\n\nAsked if Nielsen was planning to stay in her role, DHS press secretary Tyler Houton said, \"The secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the President's security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so.\"\n\nOne White House official told CNN over the weekend that Kelly's and Nielsen's fates seem tied. If Kelly leaves, Nielsen will likely leave too, according to this person.\n\nRyan Zinke\n\nAnother Cabinet member who may be on thin ice is Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, not because he's fallen out of favor with the President. In fact, the two have a strong affection for each other. Rather, Zinke is now facing a probe by the Department of Justice, according to two people familiar with the investigation. Its scope isn't known, but it comes as the inspector general's office has looked into a series of issues involving Zinke, including questions about conversations he had with Halliburton Chairman David Lesar, who is backing a development project in Zinke's hometown of Whitefish, Montana.\n\nAides on Capitol Hill have speculated that Zinke could step down after the midterms to run for governor of Montana. Though a political operative in the state told CNN there is already a growing list of Republican gubernatorial candidates lining up to run and there may be less room for Zinke to jump in. He could also position himself for another job in the Trump administration -- one where he could use his national security background. But Democrats warn that if they win a majority in the House, Zinke would be high on the list of Cabinet secretaries who would be brought before Congress to answer questions.\n\n\"I would find it hard to believe that he would be appointed to something that requires Senate confirmation, given his baggage,\" one Democratic Senate aide told CNN.\n\nIn the end, Zinke may be safe given his relationship with the President. \"Zinke is like Pruitt: The President likes him. He will ride this out,\" a White House official said, comparing Zinke to Scott Pruitt, the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who hung on for months despite an ethics scandal. On Monday, Trump said Zinke is doing \"a very good job\" but that he was still looking into the matter of Zinke's investigation.\n\nAn Interior Department spokesman pointed to Zinke's record as evidence that he intends to stay. \"Despite what anonymous sources who have zero insight into the matter say, Secretary Zinke will continue to serve as President Trump's Secretary of the Interior,\" the spokesman said in a statement to CNN. \"Sec. Zinke has been incredibly effective at executing the President's agenda such as increasing federal energy production and revenues (we just announced an increase of about $2 billion in FY18), cutting regulatory costs by more than $5 billion since taking office, and advancing legislation to improve infrastructure on public lands. \"\n\nThe Silent Majority\n\nPeople familiar with White House dynamics say serving in Trump's Cabinet can often feel like walking through a shooting range. Keeping a head down and avoiding the President's attention -- even when it's positive -- is often more beneficial to self-preservation than landing on his radar at all.\n\nThat's largely worked for less-noticed officials like Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Small Business Administration head Linda McMahon and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who have all conducted their jobs without much fanfare and equally little attention from Trump.\n\nCompare that to officials who found themselves embroiled in ethics scandals or overshadowing the President or both. The drawn-out firing of Pruitt was stalled for months by Republicans enamored with his anti-regulatory push, but he'd long lost the President's confidence amid negative headlines. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was swiftly ousted when his private plane use began dominating headlines.\n\nDespite a flap over the purchase of some high-priced office furniture earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has managed to stay under the radar and in the good graces of the President. It seems likely that Carson will stick around. Syndicated columnist Armstrong Williams, a close friend and confidant of Carson's, tells CNN that Carson plans to say on through Trump's first term \"because the President asked him to and he believes that's how much time it will take for his work at HUD to take hold and make a difference.\"\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has also kept a low profile, despite making headlines for some controversial comments earlier in the term. One Republican Senate aide on Capitol Hill told CNN that DeVos is hoping to stay in her post and that she recently promoted Nate Bailey as her new chief of staff. Bailey, a former director for public affairs at the Chamber of Commerce, is seen as someone who could more effectively prepare DeVos for possible hearings if Democrats take the House.\n\nAnother Cabinet member who appears not to be going anywhere is former CIA Director and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. One source points out that Pompeo has emerged as Trump's clear go-to, right-hand man, putting him atop the pecking order inside the Cabinet. Pompeo could play a significant role in the coming months in settling ongoing disagreements between Bolton and other Cabinet members, including Kelly and Mattis.", "(CNN) President Donald Trump shrugged off the prospect of Democrats going after his tax returns if the party wins control of the House in this week's midterm contests, suggesting Monday he was unbothered by a protracted fight over his financial documents.\n\n\"I don't care. They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want,\" Trump said as he deplaned in Indiana for his second rally of the day.\n\nThe President has focused much of his campaigning in the final stretch on shoring up Republican Senate candidates, though he insisted the House will still very much in play.\n\nAside from the legislative challenges a Democratic House would pose, the White House has been grappling with how its political opponents would wield new investigative powers should they assume control.\n\nA top target for Democrats remains Trump's personal tax returns, an ask that Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told the the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial board last month is \"one of the first things we'd do.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The story of an 11-year-old boy shooting his grandmother before killing himself is tragic enough.

I served alongside your husband, MAJ Brent Taylor. I flew missions with him. He was an inspiring man who loved you all. I remember him saying, \"Family is not something. It is everything.\" You may or may not be aware of some of our cultural differences, but in Afghanistan family is not everything, for many of us, family are treated as property. Here, a woman cannot express herself fully, either inside or outside the house. Here, most families treat children unfairly. Let me admit that, before I met Brent, even I did not think that women and men should be treated equally. Your husband taught me to love my wife Hamida as an equal and treat my children as treasured gifts, to be a better father, to be a better husband, and to be a better man.\n\nMrs. Taylor, Jennie, if I may call you that, I have lost eight members of my own family, including my father, three uncles and two cousins in this devastating war brought on to our nation during last 30 years. I have lost too many friends to mention. I have personally been wounded two times. I still have the scars of this brutal war on my right leg. However, I will continue to still fight this \"good fight\" in the words of your respectful husband. I am fighting for a great cause, as Brent said, \"you fight for not only the safety of Afghans, but the safety of my family back in Utah. It is your fight that keeps us out of fear and out of reach of global terrorism. We [Americans] don't want another 9/11 to happen in the United States.\n\nJennie, please pass my words to your seven children, whom I consider as brothers and sisters to my own five children, Taha, Taiba, Tawab, Aqsa and Wahab. Tell them that their father was a loving, caring and compassionate man whose life was not just meaningful, it was inspirational. I gained a great deal of knowledge from him and I am a better person for having met him. Were he here, I know he would not take any credit for that, but I want you to know it and to hear it from me. I am writing this letter to you about a man whom I considered a close friend, and whom I dearly loved. A leader; one who was the first to volunteer for any tough assignment. Never stop telling them what a great man their father was, he was a true patriot. He died on our soil but he died for the success of freedom and democracy in both of our countries. In his last message that I shared on my Twitter, he awakened not only Americans, but the world to the values of democracy and freedom.\n\nI want you all to know that most Afghans feel extreme sorrow and pain over the loss of your husband and father. When you think of our country and his sacrifice, I can't imagine your sorrow or sense of loss, but please don't think that the violent act that took his life is representative of our sentiments towards Americans. On behalf of my family and Brent's friends here in the Special Mission Wing, we pledge to continue to work hard until the end, the day when peace will return to our country and violence and hatred no longer claim the lives of both of our countrymen. I assure you that the one who shot him only represents evil and violence. I pray that God will give you strength, peace and show you his blessings in this time of great sorrow.\n\nPlease accept my condolence and sympathy.\n\nGod bless you.\n\nIn deep sorrow,\n\nMaj.

What could it hurt to eat a small slug?\n\nSo Australian teenager Sam Ballard grabbed the slimy creature and gulped it down. He had no idea that the slug carried a potentially deadly worm that would put him into a coma that lasted more than a year, paralyze his body and ultimately take his life.\n\n'Trying to act like grown-ups'\n\nIn 2010, 19-year-old Sam, an avid rugby player, was drinking with Jimmy Galvin and several more of his Australian \"mates\" when a slug began crawling across Galvin's concrete patio at his home in Sydney.\n\n\"We were sitting over here, having a bit of red wine appreciation night, trying to act as grown-ups,\" Galvin recalled in a video interview this year with Lisa Wilkinson of \"The Sunday Project,\" a current affairs talk show that airs on Network 10 in Australia.CNN reached out to Galvin but has not heard back.\n\n\"And then the conversation came up, 'Should I eat it?' \" recalled Galvin. \"And then off Sam went and bang, that's how it happened.\"\n\nIn this special report @Lisa_Wilkinson talks to the amazing family and friends of Sam Ballard #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/UXY5KGeWjF \u2014 The Project (@theprojecttv) April 1, 2018\n\nAfter downing the slug, Sam became weak and complained of severe pain in his legs, according to \"The Sunday Project.\" Sam's mother, Katie Ballard, told the news show that at first they worried he might have multiple sclerosis, which had afflicted her husband. But doctors said no, that wasn't the cause.\n\nThen Sam turned to his mother and told her he had eaten a slug, \"And I went, 'No, no one gets sick from that,' \" Katie Ballard said. CNN has also reached out to Ballard.\n\nSoon, however, doctors told them otherwise. Sam had developed rat lungworm disease from the infected slug, changing his life forever.\n\nKatie Ballard, left, with her son, Sam Ballard, in Sydney.\n\nWhat is rat lungworm disease?\n\nRat lungworm disease is caused by a parasitic worm called Angiostronjilus cantonensis. As the name suggests, the parasite lodges in the lungs of rats and is later excreted in poop.\n\nAlong comes a slug, snail, freshwater crab, shrimp, prawn or frog, and either eats the rat dung or the parasite works its way into the creature infecting it. Fish, however, do not spread the parasite.\n\nHumans can be infected if they eat the raw or undercooked contaminated animals, or vegetables carrying unseen snails or slugs that have not been thoroughly washed.\n\nIn addition, says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , beverages can become contaminated with worms if left open for snails and slugs to enter.\n\nUnlike in rats, the worm's life cycle is not completed in a human. So instead of passing through the digestive tract, the worm larvae \"can get lost, and it will go to the brain, and it'll stay there,\" said Heather Stockdale Walden, an assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida. The parasite is not passed from human to human.\n\n\"When it gets to the brain, you can have eosinophilic meningitis,\" Walden said , which is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, fever and a stiff neck, the CDC said.\n\n'So full of love'\n\nMost cases of rat lungworm disease are typically mild. But in some cases, like Sam's, the disease can cause catastrophic damage.\n\nSoon after the diagnosis, Sam fell into a coma, where he remained for 420 days, Ballard said in the Australian news report. He woke up paralyzed, unable to eat without a tube or move without intense effort. He required 24-hour care, seven days a week.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut the disease didn't affect his mental faculties, his family and friends said.\n\n\"He's in there, 100%,\" Galvin told \"The Sunday Project.\" \"I apologized to Sam about everything that happened that night in the backyard. And he just started bawling his eyes out. I know he's there.\"\n\nLate last week, Sam died, \"The Sunday Project's\" Wilkinson wrote in a blog post\n\n\"Sam passed away on Friday morning at Hornsby Hospital, not far from where he grew up, surrounded by 20 of those he most loved in the world,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Katie tells me 'the room was so full of love,' \" Wilkinson said. \"One of his friends there in the room continued, 'He had his voice and he said \"I love you\" several times to Katie.' \"", "Washington (CNN) The call to vote is plastered across America.

But the fight to occupy a handful of governor's mansions may hold more important keys to the Democratic Party's strategy for 2020.\n\nGubernatorial elections always matter. The winners on November 6 will affect the lives of millions of people in the 36 states and three territories where governor's races are being held. Someday, one of these leaders could even end up being president of the United States ( 17 previous Presidents have been former governors).\n\nBut there is an additional reason this year to watch these contests.\n\nInside the Democratic Party, a battle is raging over both demography and philosophy. It all comes down to whether, in the Trump era, Democrats should nominate heterosexual white men with more moderate views -- who theoretically could more easily appeal to Republican-leaning moderates and independents.\n\nOr should Democrats nominate people of color, women and LGBT candidates who espouse strong progressive views and who might better motivate the Democratic base?\n\nA growing number of Democratic activists are fed up with the party being dominated by politicians who don't look, think or live like most Democratic base voters. These rebels believe that more progressive and diverse candidates would give the Democrats a clearer path to victory. The outcome of Tuesday's election, particularly the governor's races, will give insight into whether their strategy is sound.\n\nHere are the governor's races I am watching that are poised to make history:\n\nGeorgia. House Democratic Minority Leader House Democratic Minority Leader Stacey Abrams is up against Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. If she wins, Abrams would be the first black woman governor in US history.\n\nFor a long time, Georgia Democrats put up conservative white Democrats who went down to defeat. Now, with Abrams offering a bold alternative that appeals to an increasingly multiracial, working-class state, the race is among the closest in the country. So close, in fact, that Kemp's history of trying to pick his own voters by purging voter rolls (something he denies doing) -- and his refusal to step down as Secretary of State, where he will administer his own election -- has become a major flashpoint.\n\nFlorida.

Rep. Ron DeSantis surged to win the Republican primary by defending Trump at every turn. But after securing the nomination, he revealed himself by warning Florida not to \"monkey this up.\" Most Floridians heard a clear reference to his opponent, Andrew Gillum, who is black.\n\nGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, shocked the political world with a surprise victory in the primary. Like Abrams, he put forward commonsense policies to retake power from elites. But I think his grassroots campaign, focused on reaching and organizing a multiracial coalition, will matter more to whether or not he wins than his progressive positions. This race could show whether Trump's divide-and-conquer strategy might outlast the candidate, or fall short against unity candidates.\n\nMaryland. Entrepreneur, lawyer, and civil rights activist Ben Jealous is trying to unseat Republican Governor Larry Hogan. Even though Maryland is a far bluer state than either Georgia or Florida, Hogan is quite popular. Still, this is one of those races where a blue wave could surprise prognosticators. Jealous' embrace of bold policies like Medicare for All and free college tuition, among others, has the potential to resonate across racial lines. And a surprising uptick in early voting might portend an upset win for Jealous.\n\nAmerica has elected only two African-American governors in the modern era: Douglas Wilder, elected in Virginia in 1990 and Deval Patrick, elected in Massachusetts in 2006.\n\nAmerica could more than double that number this year by electing three in one night -- Abrams, Gillum and Jealous. At a time when white supremacists are marching openly, that is a welcome and inspiring prospect.\n\nIdaho. A longshot of longshots made possible only by an inspiring candidate. A longshot of longshots made possible only by an inspiring candidate. Paulette Jordan is a 38-year-old state legislator and Coeur d'Alene tribal council member who has captured the imagination of young people, women and minorities in this deeply conservative state. Recent shake-ups in her campaign staff make this an unlikely test of whether that new coalition can win in Republican strongholds. But it is still worth watching -- if she wins, she would be Idaho's first female governor and the nation's first Native American governor.\n\nColorado and Vermont. Rep. Jared Polis, the Democratic candidate in Colorado, is vying . Rep. Jared Polis, the Democratic candidate in Colorado, is vying to become the nation's first openly gay governor.

Though less historic, Ohio is also on my radar, where consumer advocate Richard Cordray is running for governor, and there is also the possibility that GOP stalwarts Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Kris Kobach in Kansas may have overreached and will be punished at the polls.\n\nFor more opinion...

Opioids are a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy, like morphine, codeine or heroin, but they also include the latest concern: synthetics like oxycodone, hydrocodone and the extremely potent fentanyl.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5,500 people died of synthetic opioid overdoses in 2014, most of them related to fentanyl. That's an 80% increase over the numbers reported in 2013.\n\nLast year, the Drug Enforcement Administration issued a national alert stating that \"drug incidents and overdoses related to fentanyl are occurring at an alarming rate.\" In 2013, the DEA made 942 fentanyl seizures; in 2014, it made 3,344.\n\nStreet version vs. hospital version\n\nUsed by doctors, fentanyl is the most powerful opioid in medicine. However, according to the DEA, much of what is being found on the streets is not diverted from hospitals but rather sourced from China and Mexico. Frequently, people buy it on the street with no idea that it is fentanyl.\n\nThis year in California , fentanyl was passed off as the prescription drug Norco and sold on the streets. In just one 10-day period, this batch was responsible for at least 10 deaths and 48 overdoses.\n\nDealers are also cutting heroin with fentanyl to give the heroin a bigger kick.\n\nBeyond fentanyl itself, law enforcement is also concerned with its analogues: designer drugs with similar function but slightly different chemical structure.\n\nJust a little bit can be lethal\n\nAddicted? How to get help If you're addicted to prescription drugs, help is available. You can call the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration 24/7 hotline at 1-800-662-HELP(4357) or visit their website.\n\nThe danger of fentanyl isn't just to users. It can be a threat to anyone who comes into contact with it. The drug can be absorbed through the skin or accidentally inhaled. In 2015, a New Jersey police officer had shortness of breath, dizziness and slowed breathing after coming into contact with fentanyl.\n\nIt is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin. Just a quarter of a milligram -- 0.25 milligrams -- can kill you.\n\nFor a sense of just how little that is, a typical baby aspirin tablet is 81 mg. If you cut that tablet into 324 pieces, one of those pieces would be equal to a quarter-milligram.\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\nFentnayl can come in several forms. Used in the hospital, it can be injected, put in a patch for absorption into the body or given as a lozenge or a lollipop. Illegal forms include a powder, a pill or a piece of blotter paper placed under the tongue.\n\nWho is using and where?\n\nMore than 80% of all fentanyl seizures in 2014 were concentrated in just 10 states : Ohio, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Kentucky, Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire and Indiana.\n\nIn 2013, Ohio reported 92 fentanyl-related overdose deaths. The next year, there was a five-fold increase, with 514 deaths. In Maryland, the number of overdose deaths jumped from 58 in 2013 to 185 the next year.\n\nThough heroin used to be concentrated in low-income urban areas, opioid drug users now are predominantly white, suburban and in their late 20s.\n\nDoes naloxone work on fentanyl?\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.", "New York (CNN Business) Amazon has made this much clear: It will finish its search for a second headquarters by the end of the year. Beyond that, a lot is TBD.\n\nThe company sent cities across North America into a frenzy last year when it announced its search. Dubbed HQ2, the new facility \u2014 or facilities \u2014 will cost at least $5 billion to construct and will create as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs over the next 10 to 15 years. Employees at Amazon's ( AMZN ) main campus in Seattle will be offered the chance to relocate.\n\nThe company has narrowed 238 proposals down to 20 finalists, and executives have traveled across the United States and to one Canadian city to survey sites for Amazon's new home. But as the company provides few updates, th eories and leaks about which city will be crowned winner continue to swirl \u2014 and this week has brought a fresh flurry of news.\n\nOn Monday night, The New York Times reported that Amazon is close to a deal to split HQ2 between the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York, and the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia.\n\nLong Island City is one of four areas that New York City proposed in its bid for the Amazon project. The others were Midtown West, the Brooklyn Tech Triangle and Lower Manhattan.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday that Amazon plans to divide its second headquarters evenly between two cities instead of picking one winner. According to the Journal's sources, the rationale behind selecting two cities is to recruit enough technical talent.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report and didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the New York Times report.\n\nHere's what we know about where HQ2 plans stand.\n\nWhat qualities is Amazon seeking for HQ2?\n\nThe expected 50,000 people who will eventually work at the new headquarters will bring a huge economic boost to the winning city \u2014 or cities. The fact that the jobs pay well makes the opportunity even more attractive.\n\nBut the cities must have certain attributes.\n\nIn its request for proposals, Amazon outlined several criteria for HQ2, such as proximity to a major airport and the ability to attract technical talent. It must be a suburban or urban area with more than 1 million people. Amazon also said it was looking for communities that offer a \"stable and business-friendly\" environment and access to mass transit.\n\nWhich cities are still in the running, and who are the top contenders?\n\nDepends on who you ask.\n\nAmazon announced a list of 20 finalists for HQ2 in January, including: Atlanta; Austin; Boston; Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Denver; Indianapolis; Los Angeles; Miami; Montgomery County, Maryland; Nashville; Newark; New York City; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Raleigh; Toronto; and Washington, DC.\n\nOver the past weekend, The Washington Post reported that Northern Virginia's Crystal City was in advanced talks with Amazon for the second headquarters. On Sunday, the Journal said not only Crystal City but also Dallas and New York City were in late-stage discussions with the company. According to the Journal's sources, talks with other cities \u2014 such as Denver, Toronto and Nashville \u2014 appear to have fizzled out.\n\nAn Amazon executive took a swipe at the Washington Post report on Saturday. \"Memo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City, VA as #HQ2 selection. You're not doing Crystal City, VA any favors. And stop treating the NDA you signed like a used napkin,\" tweeted Mike Grella, Amazon's Director of Economic Development.\n\nMemo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City, VA as #HQ2 selection.

It's the only region with three finalists on the short list, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post and has a home in the nation's capital.\n\nRepresentatives for cities such as Dallas, Crystal City, Austin and Philadelphia declined to comment to CNN Business, while others did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhat are cities offering Amazon?\n\nSome cities got creative with their offers. Stonecrest, Georgia \u2014 which is still in the running as part of Atlanta's bid \u2014 offered to turn over some of its land and rename it the city of Amazon.\n\nBut on the whole, finalists took varying approaches to releasing their proposals to the public. Toronto, the only Canadian city on the short list, posted its entire bid online without redactions. The city touted its diverse technical talent, universal health care and welcoming immigration system. It also proposed real estate sites for the facility.\n\nOthers have gone public with big tax incentives. Maryland approved $8.5 billion in incentives to Amazon \u2014 the largest known package. Not far behind is Newark, New Jersey, which announced $7 billion in incentives to attract the company.\n\nBut many cities released blacked-out versions of their bids or refused to make any part of their proposals public. Philadelphia released a heavily redacted proposal that included information about possible sites and its talent pool, but blocked out details about incentives.\n\nWhere are we in the decision-making process, and when will Amazon make a final announcement?\n\nAmazon is famously secretive, so it's no surprise the company has largely remained mum throughout the HQ2 process. Since announcing its short list in January, Amazon has given virtually no public updates beyond reiterating that a decision would be made this year.\n\npotential real estate sites. According to a source familiar with the search, Amazon wrapped up visits to all 20 finalists this summer. When touring cities , Amazon representatives met with local business leaders and sawpotential real estate sites.\n\nFollowing those visits, Amazon asked the finalists for a comprehensive request for information \u2014 a standard document for economic development projects \u2014 containing a variety of questions about talent, real estate, regulations and more.", "\"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term,\" he said , while attending the 2012 Republican National Convention.\n\nNo one is making that complaint anymore.\n\nFrom left, the men accused of the Kroger shooting, Gregory A. Bush; the Tallahassee yoga shooting, Scott Paul Beierle; and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Robert Bowers.\n\nLately, the news seems filled with grim mug shots of angry white guys. A white man allegedly kills two black people at a supermarket after failing minutes earlier to enter a black church. Another opens fire at a yoga studio, killing two people and injuring five more before turning the gun on himself. And a third is accused of massacring 11 worshippers at a synagogue, afterward yelling , \"I just want to kill Jews.\"\n\nYet during this same period, Trump and others have warned Americans of another threat: a caravan of Latino migrants headed toward the United States to seek asylum. They've alternately said the caravan is filled with gang members, \"Middle Easterners\" and even people with rabies. Trump also announced plans to deploy as many as 15,000 US troops to repel the \"invasion\" and warned that if any of the caravan's migrants threw rocks at troops, they could be shot -- a threat he later denied.\n\nNo one is saying the recent spate of shootings can be blamed on the GOP. But the contrast between the terror that many Americans actually experience and the specter of violence that Trump invoked is a classic example of an insidious form of racism that some say is pervasive, though seldom acknowledged:\n\nAngry white men seeing \"primitive aggressions\" in others that they refuse to see in themselves:\n\nfar-right violent extremist groups are White men warn the public about vicious Central American gangs invading the United States, even though white men have committed more mass shootings than any other group. Some white men say \"radical Islamic terrorists\" represent the gravest threat to America, even thoughfar-right violent extremist groups are responsible for more deadly incidents in America since 9/11. Some white men, such as white nationalists who rallied last year in Charlottesville, Virginia, say they are in danger of being replaced by nonwhites, even though they still make up the vast majority of the country's CEOs billionaires and political leaders\n\nPsychologists have a name for this kind of pattern. It's called projection and happens when people or groups of people project hidden or repressed elements of themselves onto others. But if you're a member of a group that's been deemed \"the other\" by an angry white man, like Ijeoma Oluo is, this pattern is business as usual.\n\nThere is nothing more frightening to her than an angry white man, she writes in an essay that went viral called, \"The Anger of the White Male Lie.\"\n\nOluo wrote that she constantly lives with the fear that the anger of white men can turn violent toward her and \"countless other black people, brown people, disabled people, queer people, trans people, and women of every demographic.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's really everywhere,\" says Olou of this anger. \"Every single day it becomes more of a problem.\n\n\"We have pipe bombs,\" she says. \"We have shooting in synagogues. It's literally killing people.\"\n\nA sin as old as the nation\n\nThis may sound like hyperbole. But no one is saying that all white men are inherently violent or that they are the biggest threat to America. To make sweeping generalizations about any group is to make the same mistake that racists and anti-Semites make.\n\nBoston, Some nonwhite men are responsible for violence in America. Four of the most recent terrorist attacks -- in San Bernardino Chattanooga and Fort Hood -- allegedly were committed by Muslim terrorists. And, of course, the September 11 terrorist attacks were committed by Muslims.\n\nAn undocumented immigrant did kill Mollie Tibbetts , a 20-year-old Iowa student, and a grinning Mexican man featured in a Trump campaign ad did kill two California deputies.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN fact-checks Trump's racially charged ad Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN fact-checks Trump's racially charged ad 01:53\n\nYet there is a surprising body of work in literature and psychology that speaks to this tendency of some white people -- in particular, white men -- to quickly see the face of terror in an \"other.\" They do so by projecting some of the uglier, repressed aspects of themselves onto others.\n\nThis form of racism as projection is part of what the author James Baldwin wrote about in his essay, \"Letter from a Region in My Mind.\" He wrote that the racial tensions menacing America \"are involved only symbolically with color.\"\n\n\"These tensions are rooted in the very same depths as those from which love springs, or murder. The white man's unadmitted -- and apparently, to him, unspeakable -- private fears and longings are projected onto the Negro.\"\n\nThis form of projection formed the psychological backdrop for slavery.\n\nWhite male slave owners in the United States described their slaves as hypersexual beasts who craved sex -- while they raped enslaved women and tortured enslaved men.\n\nWhite male slave owners called slaves lazy and shiftless -- while they sat on porches sipping mint juleps watching them work from sunrise to sunset.\n\nThis was the form of projection that the late Winthrop D. Jordan described in a classic book on race that looked at the history of white attitudes toward race and slavery called, \"White Over Black: American Attitudes toward the Negro, 1550-1812.\"\n\n\"White men were attempting to destroy the living image of primitive aggressions which they said was the Negro but was really their own,\" Jordan wrote.\n\nBut this form of projecting is not confined to race. It fuels anti-Semitism, says Kenneth M. Reeves, a psychologist and author of the paper, \"Racism and projection of the shadow.\"\n\nThe Nazis justified their genocidal treatment of Jews by labeling them greedy money-grubbers -- while collecting gold fillings from the teeth of Jewish corpses, Reeves wrote.\n\n\"The Nazis said, 'Look at the Jews. They're rapacious.' And then they went around looting the wealth of Europe,\" Reeves told CNN.\n\nOne of the deadly aspects of projection is that those who do it are often unaware of what they're doing, Reeves says. He says projection is so common that it is a \"universal daily drama\" that prevents a person who is doing the projecting from really seeing \"the other\" in their full humanity.\n\nHe wrote: \"The world and its inhabitants are not seen and understood for who they are, but as supposed by evil and wicked mirrors of one's own unknown self.\"\n\nThe receiving end of white male anger\n\nWhen yours is the unwilling reflection in such a wicked mirror, the issue isn't abstract.

They de-emphasize their physicality, often stooping as they smile excessively and even raise the pitch of their voices so it won't sound too commanding.\n\nYou don't want a white man projecting his need to dominate onto you, so you adjust your behavior.\n\nSometimes it happens with a woman who is seen as \"angry\" by a white man.\n\nAfter Oluo wrote her essay on white male anger, a white man wrote her a fuming letter, telling her to be \"less angry.\"\n\n\"He says 'less angry,'\" she wrote, \"as if I am not currently adding his email into a file with countless other long-winded missives, dismissals and violent threats from white men who decided to take the time out of their day to let me know in sometimes very disturbing ways that they need me to be 'less angry.'\"\n\nBut this form of projection goes beyond the personal; it shapes our politics.\n\nThere are people who divide America between red and blue states, but the true fault line may lie between angry white males and the rest.\n\nSen. Graham may no longer have to worry. The Republicans are becoming what some call the \" Angry White Male Caucus .\" Already overwhelmingly white, the GOP is seeing a departure of women. Some blame it on the party's general attitude toward the #MeToo campaign and its support of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was recently confirmed to the court after accusations of sexual assault, which he denied.\n\nIndeed, the Republicans have become so associated with white male anger that one humorist recently suggested \"Americans would feel safer if a huge caravan of angry white men left the country.\"\n\nWhy white men are so angry\n\nThe Rev. Gibson Stroupe knows something about white male anger. He says he was once gripped by it. He grew up in the segregated South, where he says he used the N-word and remembered once hatching a plan as a teenager to grab a hunting rifle with his friends to harass a man who was attempting to integrate a university in Mississippi.\n\nHe says he changed because of his faith combined with forging interracial friendships. He has written extensively and lectured widely on racism.\n\nHe sees some of the anger he once felt in how some white men reacted to the election of the nation's first black president.\n\n\"That was pretty shocking to a lot of us white people, especially white males,\" says Stroupe, author of \"Deeper Water: Sermons for a New Vision.\" \"We're not accustomed to African-American men having power over us.\"\n\nHe says one of the ways that some white men deal with that fear is projecting their own violence onto black men.\n\n\"White men recognize how much we've done to black people, especially black men,\" he says. \"Our longing to hold onto our guns so tightly -- we do believe if black men get power over us they're going to do to us what we've done to them.\"\n\nThis form of projection has become a powerful political tool, says the Rev. Fred Robinson, executive director of MeckMin, a non-profit interfaith group that sponsored an interfaith service in Charlotte, North Carolina, to support members of the Pittsburgh synagogue that was attacked.\n\nPolitical leaders who project give whites someone to blame when they struggle, he says.\n\n\"Scare the rank-and-file whites to believe that somebody else is the problem: Jews are the problem. Blacks are the problem. Mexicans are the problem. Homosexuals are the problem. It works magically because it's baked in our cultural narrative,\" says Robinson, an associate pastor at Holy Covenant United Church of Christ in Charlotte.\n\nRobinson says he can envision a future where some angry white men will create an apartheid-like political system in the United States where they are able to hold onto power despite becoming a racial minority\n\n\"The nation will become more bifurcated and will descend into these tribal spaces that I don't think will be good for us,\" he says. \"I do anticipate a lot more pain.\"\n\nAnd more replays of the psychological drama that lurks behind some of the nation's most tragic events.\n\nThat would mean more white male anger. More warnings of the \"others\" invading the United States. More attacks as some white men see others as \"wicked mirrors\" of their own hidden selves.\n\nIn that kind of world, there won't be any shortage of angry white men.\n\nAnd for those who are part of \"the other,\" it means one thing: We will continue to pay the price.", "(CNN) When Nathaniel Batchelder, a 28-year-old who has autism, voted Thursday in the midterm elections, \"we were on such a high,\" said his mother, Susan Senator.\n\nBatchelder has \"a pretty severe developmental disability and a lot of anxiety and communication issues, but he's very eager to learn everything about the world,\" said Senator, who has written books about autism and lives in the Boston area.\n\nBut had he lived somewhere else -- in a state where laws place tighter voting restrictions based on \"mental competence\" -- he might not have been able to cast his ballot at all, experts say.\n\nSenator knew that she needed to come up with a way to make things as smooth as possible for her son. Batchelder voted for the first time in 2016, but when he voted in this year's primaries, he felt anxious and rushed. He went through a couple of ballots before he was able to fill one out properly.\n\nSo Senator created a booklet for her son titled \"Voting is really important. Here's how to do it.\"\n\nThe nine-page resource walks him through the process, complete with pictures of the ballot, which he could practice bubbling in, and reminders about the candidates running for different positions.\n\n\"Nat uses the pen to color in ONLY ONE CIRCLE: That is how you vote!\" the guide says. \"What are you going to be? Republican or Democrat?\"\n\nHis dad read it with him, as did his caregivers -- and right before voting, he practiced filling in the bubbles one by one. For Senator's son, knowing the rules and structure beforehand is key in addressing his anxiety before he can exercise his civic duty.\n\n\"For any person, the more you know about how something works, the better you're going to perform,\" Senator said.\n\nOn the final page of her booklet: a photo of a ballot being inserted into the voting machine, with an encouraging note:\n\n\"Put the paper in the slot of the machine! You did it!\"\n\nSusan Senator created a booklet about how to cast a ballot in the midterm elections for her son Nathaniel Batchelder, who was diagnosed with autism.\n\n'More at stake'\n\nSenator isn't the only one trying to develop a voting resource for people like her son.\n\n\"Is this something that's easily accessible or known about in the autism world? I don't think so,\" said Michael Bowman, senior developmental specialist at 3LPlace , an organization that provides support for adults with autism and other developmental disabilities in the Boston area.\n\nBowman has been putting together a nonpartisan lesson plan for members of the organization that uses a five-point scale indicating where candidates fall on certain issues. When he heard about Senator's booklet, he requested it so that he might incorporate how she described the physical process of voting to her son.\n\n\"It's something that we felt that we had to create in order to help empower our members,\" Bowman said.\n\nBowman said that many adults like those he works with might have difficulties communicating, but that doesn't mean they have a hard time putting together their thoughts or being informed voters.\n\nFor example, when Bowman first discussed marriage equality and abortion, he realized that members initially thought he was asking whether they themselves wanted to marry someone of the same gender or have a baby. So he reframed the questions in order to communicate these issues effectively.\n\nPeople with intellectual disabilities \"rarely receive instruction or other supports to encourage their participation in voting,\" according to a 2015 survey of people who care for and work with them. Most respondents said they \"believed that teaching individuals to vote was important and worthwhile and that instructional materials could be prepared that would allow people ... to understand varying political platforms or positions on at least some political issues.\"\n\nSome respondents also expressed concerns, saying they were \"mindful of the time requirements and the potential for personal bias to influence the instructional process.\"\n\nSenator said she guides all three of her sons as a parent would, and only one has a diagnosis of autism. Her family doesn't always agree on everything, she said -- but one of the things that's different about Batchelder is that \"he's a very black-and-white thinker.\" In order to have those conversations, she finds ways to be clear and concrete about issues that impact his everyday life.\n\nFor example, support from Medicaid allows Batchelder to live in an apartment with caregivers and lead an active life, playing sports, singing in a rock band, volunteering and recycling at a high school, Senator said.\n\nBatchelder sings at a Special Olympics event in Marlborough, Massachusetts, in August 2017.\n\nFor many people with disabilities, \"their livelihood depends on their health care,\" said Jennifer Mathis, director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n\n\"They have arguably more at stake than many of us.\"\n\n'Nobody should be invisible'\n\nA number of states have requirements that voters be \"competent\" in order to vote, which can have the effect of stripping away the right to vote from people with certain disabilities, Mathis said.\n\nThe US Election Assistance Commission keeps data on voters removed from registration rolls due to \"mental incompetency,\" but it's hard to say exactly how many people across the country have been prevented from voting due to disability, she added.\n\n\"Our problem with those laws is that they hold people with disabilities to a higher standard than all other voters,\" Mathis said.\n\nAccording to this year's voting rights guide led by the Bazelon Center, 40 states and the District of Columbia have policies in state constitutions or election laws that could restrict someone's right to vote if they have such a disability.\n\nOften, these policies are based on guardianship status, Mathis said, which may have been imposed after a single episode in which the person was in crisis -- as with someone who didn't take their medications or who didn't have access to services they needed.\n\n\"The consequence of that: The person is now living with the inability to make decisions about basic things for the rest of their life,\" she said.\n\nMore restrictive state policies might prevent people under guardianship from voting, while other states have less restrictive policies or ones that are difficult to enforce. Some \"middle-ground\" states might require some sort of challenge in order to prove \"competence\" -- for example, by answering questions about the governor's name or issues on the ballot, Mathis added.\n\n\"We don't expect that of voters without disabilities. We don't scrutinize the rationality of their choices,\" she said.\n\n\"I think if you ask the average voter on the street some of the questions that people with disabilities get asked in these guardianship proceedings, they wouldn't be able to answer them.\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, where Batchelder lives, people with intellectual disabilities can vote in elections unless that person's guardianship specifically states that they can't vote.\n\nSeven states' laws also use \"outmoded and stigmatizing terms\" such as \"idiots,\" \"insane persons\" and \"of unsound mind,\" according to the Bazelon Center guide.\n\n\"Even though the laws evolve over time and they may get better in some ways, it takes a very long time to get away from these fundamental views of people with disabilities as incapable,\" Mathis said. \"That's the biggest stereotype of people with disabilities.\"\n\nShe questioned why we need a voter competence standard at all, especially when 10 states have no such standard. \"The way that we know that people are competent to vote is if they show up to vote and they want to make a choice,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHowever, barriers to voting go beyond which laws are on the books, experts say. Some people may lack transportation, not know how to use the voting equipment, feel discouraged from failed attempts in the past or have a physical disability that makes a polling place inaccessible to them, according to one report\n\nBut for Batchelder, who proudly wore an \"I Voted\" sticker after casting his ballot Thursday, \"everything from start to finish was so nice -- and so easy,\" Senator said.\n\nThe polling workers sensed that he was different from some of the other voters, Senator said, \"and they immediately took Nat under their wing. And I was just so touched about that.\"\n\n\"Just because someone has a diagnosis of developmental disability, that should not disqualify someone,\" she said. \"Nobody should be invisible.\"", "(CNN) As Congress braces for the midterm elections, \"Blue Dogs\" -- a nickname for the most moderate Democrats on Capitol Hill -- are hoping to make a comeback.\n\nThe partisan gap in Congress has widened as Blue Dogs' membership has been whittled down to its current 18-member standing, but ahead of Election Day, the Blue Dog PAC has endorsed more than 20 congressional candidates it hopes to add to its ranks.\n\nWhile some Democrats are finding success in leaning into using their campaigns as a referendum on President Donald Trump, Oregon Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader, who serves as the chief candidate recruiter for the coalition, said that that strategy doesn't work for districts with prospective Blue Dogs.\n\n\"We're trying to recruit candidates that can get us into the majority. And there's an understanding, for the first time in 10 years, that the path to the majority is through the Blue Dog-type districts we need to win,\" Schrader told CNN. \"There are no more liberal districts to win. And that requires a candidate that can relate to the red in their state, not just the blue.\"\n\nBlue Dogs' push to elect more moderates to Congress bucks the current trend associated with midterm elections -- that each party is working to energize their voters with candidates appealing to their base. On the left, there are some high-profile liberals running who could also help shape a possible Democratic majority, including New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. These potential members could find themselves at odds with Blue Dogs -- particularly on issues like defense and federal spending. Still, it's unclear where these new members will fall on the issue of potentially selecting House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as House speaker should Democrats retake the chamber.\n\nSupporters of the Blue Dogs have argued they could be the key deciding group determining what legislation comes up to the House floor for a vote if Democrats obtain the chamber's majority.\n\nKristin Hawn, a Democratic strategist working with the Blue Dog PAC, said she expects that if Democrats do win, the dynamic between party members will be different than it was when Democrats led by large majorities.\n\n\"Having a slim majority will be very different from a 30-something seat majority in the House. It's not something I've ever lived through personally, but it'll be really interesting. It'll be good for the country ... how the House is run, because you have to have people actually come together,\" Hawn told CNN. \"Suddenly, the Freedom Caucus -- they don't have the balance of power anymore.\"\n\nSchrader said one issue is that even in his district the President's popularity has only increased since the 2016 election.\n\n\"They've been able to localize the race, not take on Donald Trump, not take on you know -- well, not take on Donald Trump, frankly,\" Schrader said about the candidates the PAC has endorsed.\n\nRep. Kurt Schrader, an Oregon Democrat and \"Blue Dog\" caucus chairman walks down the House steps following votes in the Capitol in March 2015. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)\n\nInstead, Schrader has encouraged candidates to come out against Pelosi, who plans to run for the House speakership should Democrats take control of the House.\n\n\"You know, I told all our candidates at the beginning of this year that you don't want to be coming out against Donald Trump. Let's not run against him,\" he said. \"You want to come out against Nancy Pelosi because you are running against her. That'll be the first question you'll get asked. If you don't answer that question right, you won't have an opportunity to talk about anything else. They'll just write you off.\"\n\nPelosi's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment on Schrader's push, but Pelosi has previously said she is not offended by Democrats who oppose her leadership.\n\n\"I'm OK. Just win, baby,\" Pelosi said in May . \"I think many of them are saying we need ... new leadership, yeah. I don't take offense at that.\"\n\nMore recently, Pelosi has billed herself as a \"transitional\" speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, though that exact timeline has not been specified.\n\nStill, Pelosi is a heavy favorite to win the speakership, and if Democrats win by a big majority, she may not even need some of these candidates to get to 218 votes. She also has leverage in her corner to help sway some of these candidates to support her in the end, such as committee assignments and PAC money.\n\nOf 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party's favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican.\n\nSalt Lake County mayor Ben McAdams, a Blue Dog-endorsed candidate attempting to unseat Utah Republican Rep. Mia Love, is among the majority Blue Dog PAC-endorsed candidates opposing Pelosi's speakership run.\n\nAnd though Trump's favorability polling is \"under water\" in his district, McAdams said he's chosen not to focus on the President during his campaign.\n\n\"I've made a conscious decision in this race -- I think my candidacy is about my reputation as the mayor of Salt Lake County, somebody who works across party lines and gets stuff done by bringing together Republicans and Democrats,\" he said. \"And that's the campaign I've tried to run. I don't think that message blends very well with an anti-anything message.\"\n\nMcAdams also said that if he wins, he hopes to work with Republicans on a transportation infrastructure package and on a fix to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a policy Trump has sought to end but has been in legal limbo for months.\n\nSchrader said that during the last Democratic majority, he felt that Blue Dogs \"were shunned.\"\n\nHe said he anticipates that \"it's going to be tough negotiating out what legislation we put forward and how we word it.\"\n\nBut compared to the last time Democrats had a majority, \"fast forward to 10 years later and suddenly my progressive colleagues are like 'Well I don't agree with a number of your votes but you sound honest and you're representing your district,'\" he said.\n\nAs for how Trump will work with a Democratic majority -- Schrader isn't so concerned. He said he thinks the President is \"a pliable guy.\"\n\n\"I think he'd be fine. The President, he's totally amoral. He has no values. He'd be easy to work with,\" he said. \"Whatever we decide, he'd get in front of at the end of the day and make sure everyone knew it was his idea. I think we're in good shape.\"", "(CNN) President Donald Trump was not pleased by the marquee closing TV ad his campaign unveiled last week featuring upbeat themes about the economy.\n\n\"He hated it,\" one Republican official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations the President had with allies.\n\nInstead, he insisted to aides that his closing argument for the midterm elections would be a hardline anti-immigration message to fire up his core supporters , two Republican officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nHouse Republican sources who had been frustrated with the President for a number of reasons this election year very much liked the ad touting the economy because it was a rare appeal to the very suburban female voter they are worried about losing big time -- largely because of the President's polarizing rhetoric.\n\nThis mixed messaging is yet another indication of the divide playing out inside Trump's inner circle -- and Republicans at large -- on the eve of the midterm elections. The debate remains whether the message of fear and division over immigration was the best course for the President to take, rather than to talk more about the booming economy as many GOP leaders have implored Trump to do.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) Colorado's flourishing oil industry could be dealt a powerful blow on Tuesday by voters worried about the safety and environmental side effects of the shale boom.\n\nProposition 112 calls for banning oil and gas companies from drilling any wells within 2,500 feet of occupied buildings, water sources and other \"vulnerable\" areas.\n\nIf approved, the ballot question would eliminate future drilling locations in a chunk of the surging Denver-Julesburg, or DJ, basin in Colorado, one of the nation's largest oil-producing states. Much of the Colorado land held by oil companies like Anadarko Petroleum ( APC ) and Noble Energy ( NBL ) would suddenly be off limits to new drilling.\n\n\"The long-term impact of Proposition 112 on Colorado's oil and gas industry would be dramatic,\" Artem Abramov, head of shale research at Rystad Energy, wrote in a recent report.\n\nNo wonder the oil and gas industry has spent more than $30 million to defeat the ballot question.\n\n'Scary' for companies\n\nThere has been limited public polling on Proposition 112, which has received the backing of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nUniversity of Colorado online poll showed narrow support for the ballot question that was barely within the margin of error. A mid-October poll by Height Capital Markets found that 43% of respondents support the measure, while 47% oppose. Height Capital sees a 20% chance of Proposition 112 passing.\n\n\"It's going to be tight. It's kind of scary for the companies,\" said Katie Bays, an energy analyst at Height Capital Markets.\n\nEven though Texas and North Dakota get most of the attention, Colorado's oil industry is soaring thanks to the shale revolution.\n\nThe state's production has quintupled over the past decade to a record-high 477,000 barrels a day as of August, according to federal government stats . Colorado only ranks behind Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, North Dakota, New Mexico and Oklahoma in terms of oil production.\n\nTechnological advances have opened access to oil resources that were previously trapped beneath the ground. Breakeven prices in the DJ basin have plunged from $80 a barrel in 2010-2011 to as low as $30 today, according to Rystad Energy.\n\nThe state's oil and gas industry employs more than 100,000 workers, according to the Colorado Oil & Gas Association.\n\nOil output could be cut by 54%\n\nBut now environmental groups, led by Colorado Rising, are pushing to rein in the industry. They argue the current setback distance of 500 feet from homes and 1,000 feet from schools is not strong enough.\n\n\"I support Proposition 112 because it keeps our communities safe from the many serious dangers of drilling and fracking near homes, schools, hospitals, parks and water sources,\" Julia Williams, volunteer coordinator at climate group 350 Colorado, said in an email.\n\nProposition 112 would have a dramatic impact on some companies' Colorado business. Anadarko Petroleum, Extraction Oil & Gas ( XOG ) and PDC Energy ( PDCE ) have more than 90% of their acreage within the buffer zone that would be impacted, according to Rystad.\n\nS&P Global Platts Analytics estimates that Proposition 112 would curtail oil production by 54% within five years. And more than three-quarters of Weld County, the production center of the DJ basin, would be rendered off limits to new oil and gas development, S&P said.\n\n\"It basically says we're trying to run oil and gas out of the state of Colorado,\" said Jeff Bush, president of CSI Recruiting, a Denver-based oil and gas recruiting firm.\n\nBush said that his firm would be \"greatly impacted\" by Proposition 112, which he described as \"over-the-top.\"\n\nAnadarko warns of a shift\n\nOil companies have been racing to get approval to drill in Colorado ahead of the vote. There were 200 more drilling permits granted in Weld County in the third quarter of this year compared to the second quarter, according to Rystad.\n\nAnadarko Petroleum warned last week that Proposition 112 might change how the company allocates capital in 2019.\n\n\"Regardless of what happens, we feel confident we can continue to deliver our expected 2019 result given the flexibility of our portfolio,\" CEO R.A. Walker told analysts.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Colorado Oil & Gas Association warned that Proposition 112 could \"cripple\" Colorado by costing the state 147,800 jobs.\n\n\"A half-mile setback is a blatant attempt by activists to ban oil and natural gas in Colorado and put working families on the unemployment line,\" Dan Haley, CEO of the industry group, said in a statement released after the proposition was announced.\n\nWhat about 2020?\n\nIf Proposition 112 passes, its impact would not be felt immediately. The major oil developers have a year or two worth of permits for projects that would still be allowed to go forward. However, Rystad estimates that DJ oil production would peak in early 2021 and fall below current levels by 2023-2024 if the measure is successful.\n\nEven if Big Oil wins on Tuesday, a close vote could force the industry to find a compromise with Denver to restore confidence among shaken investors. Otherwise they run the risk of a similar proposal returning in two years when Democratic turnout will likely be even higher.\n\n\"The cards may fall differently in 2020 when Donald Trump is on the ballot again,\" said Bays, the Height Capital analyst.", "(CNN) Voters in 37 states will have more than candidates to choose in Tuesday's election. There are more than 150 statewide measures on ballots this midterm election , and several involve health-related issues such as Medicaid expansion, marijuana, abortion, grocery taxes and charges related to drug use and possession.\n\nAbortion\n\nAlabama, Oregon and West Virginia have measures that are aimed at restricting abortion access. If passed, Alabama's Amendment 2 will add language to the state Constitution to give a fetus the same rights as a human who has been born.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters in Alabama worry that the amendment could be used to criminalize some forms of in-vitro fertilization and contraception. There are also concerns that should the US Supreme Court end Roe v. Wade, this amendment would be a \"trigger ban,\" meaning abortion would be outlawed in the state.\n\nThis \"personhood\" ballot measure doesn't have exemptions like in other states' laws that carve out the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or the danger to the life of the mother.\n\nOregon's Measure 106 would end state funding for abortions. Women who are public employees or who are on Medicaid would no longer get coverage for the procedure. There are exceptions for rape, incest, and a pregnancy that is a threat to the woman's health.\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1 , also known as the No Constitutional Right to Abortion Amendment, would explicitly state that its Constitution has nothing in it that \"secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\" It also has an exception for rape, incest, fetal anomaly or threats to the woman's life. It would essentially restrict Medicaid funding for abortions.\n\nMarijuana\n\nVoters in four states will have to decide how they feel about marijuana. In Michigan and North Dakota, they will consider whether recreational use should be legal for adults over 21. North Dakota's amendment would also automatically expunge the record of someone who had a conviction related to weed.\n\nOther states' weed-related initiatives focus on medical marijuana; 31 states and the District of Columbia have laws that legalize or decriminalize it.\n\nMissouri has three medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot this year. Amendment 2 would legalize medical marijuana, tax it at 4% and guarantee that the money would be spent on health care services for veterans. Amendment 3 also would legalize it for medical reasons and tax it at 15%, and the money would have to be spent to create a Biomedical Research and Drug Development Institute, a state-run institution that would look for cures for disease. The money that the drugs would earn would go back to the state.\n\nIf voters say yes Proposition C , a separate ballot question, would also legalize medical marijuana and tax it at 2%, and the money would have to go toward veterans, drug treatment, education and law enforcement.If voters say yes to all three , the one that gets the \"largest affirmative vote shall prevail.\"\n\nIn Utah, if voters say yes to Proposition 2, individuals with qualifying illnesses would get access to medical marijuana.\n\nHealth care\n\nMontana, Idaho, Nebraska and Utah will consider expanding Medicaid. Montana's I-185 would also raise taxes on tobacco products to help fund the expansion and other health care programs.\n\nIdaho's Proposition 2 would expand Medicaid eligibility to people under 65 whose income is 138% of the federal poverty level, as would Nebraska's Initiative 427 and Utah's Proposition 3 . In Utah, that expansion would be funded in part by a sales tax increase.\n\nThere may be additional election-related changes with Medicaid. If Democrats win in Georgia, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Florida, there's a possibility those states could expand Medicaid as well. In Florida alone, a million people would get health care coverage if Medicare is expanded in that state. Potentially, 2.7 million additional Americans could get coverage if elections go Democrats way in those states.\n\nIn Montana, the ballot question could end the Medicaid expansion there. The Tobacco industry has spent millions in the state to fight the initiative since it would double the cigarette task to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion.\n\nOther health care initiatives are on the ballot in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 4 would authorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. Proposition 8 would require dialysis clinics to refund patients for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care. Supporters of the initiative believe this would incentivize clinics to spend money on health care improvements rather than putting it toward their profits.\n\nProposition 11 would require people who work on ambulances to stay on call during breaks and require employers to give EMTs and paramedics additional training and some paid mental health services.\n\nQuestion 1 in Massachusetts would limit the number of patients assigned to registered nurses working in a hospital. The state has such restrictions for intensive care units but not for any other part of the hospital.\n\nNevada's Question 4 would require the state legislature to remove taxes on durable medical equipment, oxygen equipment and mobility devices that are prescribed by a licensed provider.\n\nOther health matters\n\nIn Massachusetts, with Question 3 , voters will decide whether they want to keep a law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public places like restaurants, stores, hotels and hospitals. There's no federal law that provides such protections. Without them, supporters of the ballot question say, people who identify as transgender could be denied access to doctors' offices, hospitals and other medical care.\n\nSouth Dakota's Initiated Measure 25 would increase taxes on tobacco products. Virginia's Question 2 would remove a restriction on tax exemption for the surviving spouse of a disabled veteran. Maine's Question 1 would create a payroll tax and non-wage income tax that would fund a home health care program.\n\nIn New Mexico, Bond Question A would provide $10.77 million in bonds for senior citizen facilities.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOhio will vote on Issue 1 , which would eliminate the option for a felony charge for the possession or use of drugs, would require the state to spend on programs that would include helping people get into drug treatment and rehabilitation programs, would create sentencing programs that involve drug rehab, and would prohibit courts from sending a person to prison for non-criminal probation violations.",

estudios en ratas y ratones no debe aplicarse al uso del tel\u00e9fono celular en humanos\n\nPero la FDA no est\u00e1 de acuerdo con la 'clara evidencia' de la que habla el otro estudio\n\nLos Institutos Nacionales de Salud dicen que hay un v\u00ednculo entre las radiaciones del celular y el c\u00e1ncer\n\n(CNN) - La evidencia de que hay un v\u00ednculo entre el c\u00e1ncer y las radiaciones de los tel\u00e9fonos celulares ahora es m\u00e1s clara, seg\u00fan dijeron los Institutos Nacionales de Salud este jueves.\n\n\u201cEl Programa Nacional de Toxicolog\u00eda concluy\u00f3 que hay una evidencia clara de que las ratas machos expuestas a altos niveles de radiaci\u00f3n de radiofrecuencia (RFR) como la usada en los tel\u00e9fonos celulares 2G y 3G desarrollaron tumores cardiacos cancerosos\u201d, dijo la agencia en un comunicado. La conclusi\u00f3n viene de una investigaci\u00f3n que eval\u00faa el efecto de la radiaci\u00f3n de radiofrecuencia, que se utiliza en los tel\u00e9fonos celulares.\n\n\u201cTambi\u00e9n hubo alguna evidencia de tumores cerebrales y en la gl\u00e1ndula suprarrenal en las ratas macho expuestas. Para las ratas hembra, y ratones machos y hembra, la evidencia fue equ\u00edvoca en cuanto a si los c\u00e1nceres observados estaban asociados con la exposici\u00f3n a RFR\".\n\nEl reporte concuerda con un borrador que fue publicado en febrero de este a\u00f1o.\n\nLo que fue sorprendente, sin embargo, es que otra agencia federal de salud, la FDA, no est\u00e1 de acuerdo con esa conclusi\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cDespu\u00e9s de revisar el estudio, no estamos de acuerdo con la conclusi\u00f3n de su reporte final en relaci\u00f3n a la \u2018clara evidencia\u2019 de actividad cancer\u00edgena en roedores expuestos a energ\u00eda de radiofrecuencia\u201d, dijo Jeffrey Shuren, director del Centro de Dispositivos y Salud Radiol\u00f3gica de la FDA, en un comunicado este jueves en respuesta al reporte.\n\nSin embargo, las dos agencias, que dependen del Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos de Estados Unidos, concuerdan en que los hallazgos de esos estudios en ratas y ratones no debe aplicarse al uso del tel\u00e9fono celular en humanos.\n\n\u201cLas exposiciones usadas en estudios no pueden ser comparados directamente a la exposici\u00f3n que experimentan los humanos cuando usan un tel\u00e9fono celular\u201d, dijo en un comunicado John Bucher, cient\u00edfico senior del Programa Nacional de Toxicolog\u00eda. \u201cEn nuestros estudios, las ratas y los humanos recibieron radiofrecuencia en todos sus cuerpos. En contraste, las mayor\u00eda de las personas est\u00e1n expuestas en tejidos locales cerca a donde sostienen el tel\u00e9fono. Adem\u00e1s, los niveles de exposici\u00f3n y duraci\u00f3n en nuestros estudios fueron m\u00e1s grandes de lo que la gente experimenta\u201d.\n\nEl reporte final y el consenso del Programa Nacional de Toxicolog\u00eda son la conclusi\u00f3n de un esfuerzo de 10 a\u00f1os y 30 millones de d\u00f3lares en investigaci\u00f3n.\n\nLa investigaci\u00f3n incluy\u00f3 dos grandes estudios con animales \u2014uno en ratas y otro con ratones\u2014 que relacionan altos niveles de radiaci\u00f3n de tel\u00e9fonos celulares con alguna evidencia de actividad cancer\u00edgena en ratas macho, incluyendo un tipo inusual de tumor llamado schwannoma en sus corazones. No hubo hallazgos significativos en ratas hembra.\n\nDe la misma manera, no emergieron hallazgos significativos en el estudio con ratones, seg\u00fan el reporte.\n\n\"Una de las cosas que nos parecieron m\u00e1s interesantes sobre nuestros hallazgos fue que los schwannomas malignos, aunque ocurrieron en el coraz\u00f3n y no en la cabeza de estos animales, en realidad fueron schwannomas\u201d, dijo Bucher en febrero cuando lanzaron el borrador del reporte.\n\nLa FDA subraya que los celulares emiten bajos niveles de energ\u00eda de radiofrecuencia que es no inonizante y por lo cual no es considerado lo suficientemente fuerte para causar un da\u00f1o permanente en el tejido biol\u00f3gico, incluyendo el ADN.\n\nLos Institutos Nacionales de Salud tambi\u00e9n subrayan que en los estudios no fueron incluidas las redes 5G o wifi.\n\n\u201cLa 5G es una tecnolog\u00eda emergente que a\u00fan no ha sido definida realmente. Desde lo que actualmente entendemos, al parecer difiere totalmente de lo que hemos estudiado\u201d, dijo Michael Wyde, toxic\u00f3logo l\u00edder de los estudios.\n\nConfusi\u00f3n y controversia\n\nLos estudios del Programa Nacional de Toxicolog\u00eda involucraron unos 3.000 roedores, como fue detallado en el borrador del reporte en febrero.\n\nLos animales fueron expuestos a niveles de radiaci\u00f3n por radiofrecuencia igual o superiores al nivel m\u00e1s alto permitido actualmente para emisiones de tel\u00e9fonos m\u00f3viles. Los investigadores rastrearon la salud de los animales desde el \u00fatero hasta los dos a\u00f1os.\n\nUna rata de 2 a\u00f1os podr\u00eda ser comparable de alguna manera a un humano de 70 a\u00f1os, dijo Butcher.\n\nLos investigadores dividieron a los roedores en dos grupos, basados en niveles de radiaci\u00f3n por radiofrecuencia, menor o mayor, y expusieron sus cuerpos completos a radiaci\u00f3n aument\u00e1ndola 10 minutos a la vez para llegar a un total de aproximadamente nueve horas al d\u00eda en un periodo de dos a\u00f1os.\n\n\u201cEs importante considerar la magnitud de la exposici\u00f3n en animales en estos estudios en relaci\u00f3n a lo que uno podr\u00eda recibir t\u00edpicamente usando un tel\u00e9fono celular\u201d, dijo Bucher. \u201cEl nivel de energ\u00eda de radiofrecuencia m\u00e1s bajo que estudiamos fue similar al nivel actual m\u00e1s alto permitido para emisiones de celulares\u201d.\n\nEntre las ratas macho, los investigadores encontraron tumores en cerca del 6% de aquellas que estuvieron en el grupo de mayor exposici\u00f3n, dijo Bucher. Ese porcentaje \u201cexcedi\u00f3 la incidencia hist\u00f3rica media (0,8%) y super\u00f3 la tasa m\u00e1s alta observada en un solo grupo de control hist\u00f3rico (2%) de los estudios completados revisados por pares\u201d, escribieron los investigadores.\n\nLos investigadores tambi\u00e9n encontraron que las ratas macho en el grupo de mayor exposici\u00f3n parecieron vivir m\u00e1s tiempo que las otras ratas, pero se necesita m\u00e1s investigaci\u00f3n para determinar por qu\u00e9 y c\u00f3mo esto puede ser relevante para los resultados de los estudios.\n\n\u201cEstudios animales como este contribuyen a nuestra discusi\u00f3n sobre este tema, pero debemos recordar que el estudio no fue dise\u00f1ado para probar la seguridad de los celulares en humanos, as\u00ed que no podemos sacar conclusiones sobre los riesgos de los celulares al usarlos\u201d, dijo Shuren.\n\n\u201cCon base en nuestra evaluaci\u00f3n en curso sobre este tema, la totalidad de la evidencia cient\u00edfica disponible sigue sin apoyar los efectos adversos para la salud en los seres humanos causados por exposiciones ya sea por debajo o en los l\u00edmites actuales de exposici\u00f3n a la energ\u00eda de radiofrecuencia. Creemos que los l\u00edmites existentes de seguridad para los tel\u00e9fonos celulares siguen siendo aceptables para la protecci\u00f3n de la salud p\u00fablica\u201d.",

divorce cases involving child custody, but so do many fathers.\n\nFor parents who are trying to juggle shared custody, child support payments and their careers \u2014 finding the right life-balance can seem impossible.\n\n\n\nSometimes disagreements escalate into messy legal battles that require judges, attorneys and therapists to step in and help.\n\nIn her CNN Original Series, \"This is Life,\" Lisa Ling spoke with fathers who feel the system has let them down.\n\nOne is a divorced father who has spent time in jail because he said he couldn't pay his court-ordered child support.\n\n\"I'm currently at $680,000 worth of arrears, at 9% interest,\" said Dr. Carlos Rivera. \"I will never be able to get out of this hole.\" Rivera, a pediatrician, says he went bankrupt, was let go from his medical practice and now makes about $100 per month.\n\nIn another case, a father named Jake was banned from seeing his children by something called a civil protection order.\n\nIn court documents, Jake's wife said he went through dangerous mood swings, blocked her internet access and tried to obstruct her from driving away with the kids. \"Within a month and a half I lost my kids, I lost my wife and I lost my house,\" said Jake, who denies doing anything to hurt his children and who didn't want CNN to use his last name.\n\nA third situation doesn't involve marriage or divorce. Justin -- who also asked CNN not to use his last name -- fathered a son during a brief relationship. He learned his name wasn't listed on the child's birth certificate and he didn't get equal custody of his son.\n\n\"How can I be a father to my kid if I only see him four nights out of the whole month?\" Justin told Ling.\n\nIn America, more than 80% of custodial parents -- the parent that kids live with most -- are mothers. Is it harder for men to get a fair shake in custody cases involving children? Do laws and courts favor women because of a traditional presumption that women are better care-givers for children?\n\n\n\nAccording to laws in most states, they're not supposed to, says family law attorney Randall Kessler, author of \"Divorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids and Your Future.\" \"But some judges may be old-fashioned and they might think the mom should have custody,\" he said.\n\nWe posed some tough questions to Kessler, along with Fulton County, Georgia, Superior Court Judge Gail Tusan and board-certified family therapist Ephrat Lipton of the Atlanta Center for Wellness , to offer insight and advice on how fathers \u2014 and parents in general \u2014 can avoid acrimonious outcomes during the often painful legal process of uncoupling.\n\nWhat if dads can't pay child support?\n\nAttorney Randy Kessler\n\nPay something\n\nDon't ignore this situation, it's important. Most people can pay something. If there's any way you can pay even a small amount toward your child support, do it. If you don't, you're certainly risking jail time.\n\n\"Unfortunately the best way to prove to a judge that you can't pay is to sit in jail for two weeks.\"\n\nDon't give up\n\nYou can't reduce your child support payments unless you get in front of a judge. \"So, be politely persistent. Don't give up. Keep going.\"\n\n\n\nHire a lawyer\n\nIt sounds like a contradiction, but it's true: Hire a lawyer to tell a judge you can't afford child support. Judges don't appreciate having to deal with someone who is trying to learn the law on the fly.\n\n\"If you can't hire someone, at least get a lawyer's advice.\"\n\nJudge Gail Tusan\n\nMake a good-faith effort\n\nJudges are quite aware that people lose their jobs and times can be tough. But child support is so important that judges expect parents to do whatever is necessary to support their children.\n\n\"You can't just say, 'I'm a displaced CEO and there's no way I'm going to work at McDonald's. That's beneath me. And therefore everyone should just understand.'\"\n\nErasing the slate\n\nJudges cannot just erase a parent's slate of what he or she owes in child support. The money is owed to maintain the safety and security of the child. But some judges will consider modifying a child support agreement in certain circumstances.\n\n\"We're trying to make decisions based certainly on the practicality of what the income is.\"\n\nTherapist Ephrat Lipton\n\nDon't get mad\n\nAnger can complicate a divorce by getting in the way. Angry people can easily get irritable and agitated. The solution is to channel that anger differently. Accept the situation and deal with it the best way you can.\n\n\"It's an amazing and powerful thing when you just say, 'It is how it is and there's nothing I can do about that.'\"\n\nEqual rights for unofficial dads\n\nAttorney Randy Kessler\n\nDads can catch up\n\nIn general, the legal default is: if two unmarried people have a child and no papers have been signed, the woman who bore the child starts out with custody.\n\nThe dad is not official. But he can catch up really quickly. He files what are called legitimation papers, asking the court to establish that making him the official father is in the child's best interest.\n\nJUST WATCHED When Dad can only parent a few days a month Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH When Dad can only parent a few days a month 01:00\n\n\"This sounds oversimplified, but the court has to decide what's in the child's best interest. The problem is that decision may be a question of how that judge was raised or what that judge's values are.\"\n\nJudge Gail Tusan\n\nStep up\n\nThe father should come forward as soon as possible and express his desire to have a relationship. That will put him in a far better position than if someone has to go hunt him down to make him have a relationship.\n\n\"The more time that has gone by between the child being in life and the father stepping forward makes it more difficult to resolve.\"\n\nTherapist Ephrat Lipton\n\nBe grateful\n\nBeing grateful for what you have is important during stressful circumstances. Scientific research shows that daily gratitude can improve your mood more than simple positive thinking.\n\n\"There's all this neuroscience now. We're actually understanding the brain so much better than we did before.\"\n\nProtection orders\n\nAttorney Randy Kessler\n\nWhat are protection orders? Are they fair?\n\nIf a parent goes into court and accuses the other parent of being a threat for domestic violence, the judge can issue an immediate order of protection, which legally bars the first parent from access to the children.\n\n\"The other parent doesn't have to be in court for a judge to issue the order, which sounds a little unfair to the other side. But on balance it's probably a good thing because the orders probably protect more people than they hurt.\"\n\nIs there a way to prevent or protect against protection orders?\n\nYou could have a witness present during visits with children. Or you could record video of the visit with a smartphone. In many states you can record without the other side knowing. So be aware of local laws.\n\nA judge could use the video to decide if the parent really did pose a threat to his children.\n\n\"It's sort of a virtual witness.\"\n\nJudge Gail Tusan\n\nStay cool\n\nJust exhale and try to stay cool. Don't try to fix it yourself by going to court and saying: \"She's a liar.\"\n\nGet some legal advice about the best next steps. Figure out if this is just an unfortunate once-in-a-lifetime argument with everyone feeling much better the next day ... or is this the latest episode in a history of domestic violence. Each of those situations should be resolved in a different way.\n\nProtection orders used as a strategy tool\n\nBetter lawyers won't use protection orders for strategy purposes in a divorce case. They should be used as an emergency maneuver only, when something out of the ordinary has happened and somebody needs help immediately.\n\nTherapist Ephrat Lipton\n\nBreak it down\n\nWhen working with someone who feels traumatized because everything's been ripped away from them, it helps for them to break it down. They should remind themselves they're alive and healthy and living freely in the world.\n\n\"Even if there's nothing you can do to fix your situation, embrace whatever you can hang on to.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl problema de la trampa est\u00e1 en el centro de la guerra contra los derechos de votaci\u00f3n\n\n(CNN) - Son diversas las referencias a Kris Kobach, el secretario de Estado de Kansas.\n\n\"Un defensor incansable de la seguridad del votante\", seg\u00fan lo alab\u00f3 el presidente Donald Trump.\n\n\"El arquitecto de la supresi\u00f3n del voto a nivel nacional\", y \"supresor en jefe del voto\", han sido las advertencias de los cr\u00edticos Ari Berman, autor, y de Jason Kander, pol\u00edtico.\n\nLEE: Estados Unidos vota este martes en las elecciones intermedias, \u00bfqu\u00e9 est\u00e1 en juego?\n\n\"La peor pesadilla de la Asociaci\u00f3n de la Uni\u00f3n de Libertades Civiles de Estados Unidos\", declaraba un anunciante al comienzo de cada episodio del exprograma de radio de Kobach.\n\nCuando nos sentamos frente a frente con Kobach, en su oficina de Topeka, para una entrevista poco frecuente, supimos que es alguna de esas cosas y m\u00e1s: un fan\u00e1tico de que existe el votante fraudulento y que es su misi\u00f3n ponerle fin.

Desde las elecciones del 2016, las repetidas afirmaciones de Trump sobre fraude electoral generalizado han sido refutadas una y otra vez.\n\nKobach fue tambi\u00e9n el hombre que Trump consult\u00f3 como l\u00edder de su Comisi\u00f3n de Asesoramiento Presidencial sobre la Integridad de las Elecciones. En su primera reuni\u00f3n, en julio de 2017, el presidente declar\u00f3: \"Es necesario poner fin a toda forma de voto ilegal o fraudulento, sea con no ciudadanos o con fallecidos, a cualquier forma de supresi\u00f3n o intimidaci\u00f3n del votante\u2026 Tengo expectativas sobre los hallazgos y recomendaciones que producir\u00e1n su informe\u2026 se sabr\u00e1 y se sacar\u00e1 a la luz toda la verdad, de ser necesario\".\n\nMenos de seis meses despu\u00e9s de convocada, la Comisi\u00f3n se disolvi\u00f3 sin publicar ning\u00fan hallazgo.\n\nSurgen controversias sobre el acceso al voto\n\nHoy, Kobach es el candidato del Partido Republicano a la gobernaci\u00f3n de Kansas. Es el principal defensor en la naci\u00f3n de leyes m\u00e1s estrictas para el votante y una figura controvertida que protagoniza el pr\u00f3ximo documental de CNN: \"Democracy in Peril: The War on Voting Rights\", que se estren\u00f3 el viernes 2 de noviembre.\n\nDurante casi un a\u00f1o, nuestro equipo viaj\u00f3 por todo el pa\u00eds para reunirse con personas en las trincheras que trabajan sin cesar en pos de las elecciones: activistas, pol\u00edticos, legisladores e investigadores acad\u00e9micos que estudian el sufragio. Entrevistamos a personas mayores que votaron en las elecciones durante d\u00e9cadas que, de buenas a primeras, est\u00e1n lidiando con obst\u00e1culos para emitir su voto. Conocimos a un hombre que se enfrent\u00f3 a a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n y cientos de miles de d\u00f3lares en multas cuando fue procesado por fraude electoral. Nos sentamos con querellantes que llevaron su caso sin precedentes hasta la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos por temor a que sus votos no tuvieran ning\u00fan peso.\n\nEn las semanas previas a las elecciones intermedias del 6 de noviembre, han brotado controversias sobre el acceso al voto de costa a costa.\n\nSeg\u00fan un nuevo requisito en Dakota del Norte, los ind\u00edgenas estadounidendes deben mostrar formas espec\u00edficas de documento con foto que muestre su direcci\u00f3n. El problema es que hay pocos nombres de calles en sus reservas. Muchos de los nativos estadounidenses reciben su correo en un apartado de correos y no saben su direcci\u00f3n, muy pocos la tienen impresa en un documento con su foto. Los cr\u00edticos dicen que esta capa de burocracia adicional reprime a esta comunidad. Dakota del Norte es donde la dem\u00f3crata Heidi Heitkamp gan\u00f3 su esca\u00f1o en el senado por menos de 3.000 votos, en el 2012.\n\nDurante el verano, surgi\u00f3 una controversia en Georgia despu\u00e9s de una propuesta de cerrar siete de nueve locales de votaci\u00f3n en un condado mayoritariamente negro.\n\nUna investigaci\u00f3n reciente de CNN hall\u00f3 que un condado suburbano de Georgia descart\u00f3 cientos de votos en ausencia por discrepancias con fechas de nacimiento, direcciones y correspondencia de firmas. De los 595 votos en ausencia rechazados en el condado de Gwinnett, m\u00e1s de 300 pertenec\u00edan a personas negras estadounidenses y a estadounidenses de ascendencia asi\u00e1tica. La semana pasada, un juez de un tribunal federal le orden\u00f3 a los funcionarios electorales de Georgia frenar el rechazo de votos en ausencia por falta de correspondencia entre las firmas.\n\nUn forcejeo en Georgia\n\nEntretanto, el secretario de Estado de Georgia, Brian Kemp, que es tambi\u00e9n el candidato republicano a la gobernaci\u00f3n, enfrenta fuertes cr\u00edticas y juicios despu\u00e9s de que Associated Press reportara que su oficina suspendi\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 53.000 solicitudes de inscripciones de votante. Casi el 70% de estas inscripciones eran de negros estadounidenses. La oficina de Kemp sostiene que a esos votantes se les permitir\u00e1 votar, probablemente mediante una papeleta provisional, si traen un documento adecuado.\n\nLa opositora dem\u00f3crata de Kemp, Stacey Abrams, dice que la lista de suspensi\u00f3n es un ejemplo cl\u00e1sico de supresi\u00f3n del voto.\n\n\"\u00bfQu\u00e9 hay de esos votantes de baja propensi\u00f3n\u2026? No saben que pueden acercarse a las urnas\", dijo. \"Reciben una carta confusa que dice que hay algo mal con su inscripci\u00f3n y, lo m\u00e1s probable, es que dejen pasar estas elecciones. El miasma de miedo que se crea mediante la represi\u00f3n del votante trata de infundir miedo en la gente que intenta votar, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n de bloquear su capacidad de hacerlo\".\n\nLEE: Las elecciones intermedias de 2018 en EE.UU. son las m\u00e1s caras de la historia, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9?\n\nLa campa\u00f1a de Kemp considera \"espurias\" las acusaciones sobre represi\u00f3n de los votantes en Georgia y se\u00f1ala el \"r\u00e9cord m\u00e1ximo\" de inscripciones de votantes y de votaci\u00f3n durante el per\u00edodo de Kemp.\n\nEs la misma respuesta que ofrece el secretario de Estado Kobach cuando lo cuestionan por el impacto de la legislaci\u00f3n de documentaci\u00f3n estricta para el votante en su propio estado y si esto priva del derecho al voto a sus votantes.\n\n\"Estoy intentando evitar que los votantes cometan fraude, lo que efectivamente priva del derecho al voto de la gente que no vota leg\u00edtimamente\u2026 El fraude electoral infecta a todo nuestro sistema. No solo inclina potencialmente un resultado para el candidato que, de hecho, no gan\u00f3 las elecciones, sino que tambi\u00e9n afecta la voluntad de la gente para salir a votar\", dijo Kobach.\n\nKobach cree firmemente que las medidas, como la requerir una identificaci\u00f3n con foto el d\u00eda de elecci\u00f3n y prueba de ciudadan\u00eda al inscribirse para votar, sumado a la purga de lista de votantes, son necesarias para la integridad electoral.\n\n\"Solo parte de su estrategia\"\n\nLos cr\u00edticos las denominan t\u00e1cticas que amenazan la democracia.\n\n\"En nuestra historia, la represi\u00f3n de votantes no fue perpetrada por un partido solamente. Fue perpetrada por los que tienen el poder contra los que tienen menos poder\", seg\u00fan dijo Jason Kander, dem\u00f3crata, exsecretario de Estado de Missouri, y fundador de la organizaciones de las bases Let America Vote. \"En la reiteraci\u00f3n moderna de represi\u00f3n de votantes en las \u00faltimas dos d\u00e9cadas, eso ha hecho el Partido republicano y est\u00e1 a simple vista. Es parte de su estrategia\".\n\nSeg\u00fan Kobach, no es un problema partidario, a pesar de que toda la investigaci\u00f3n muestra que la mayor\u00eda de los afectados por estas leyes son negros, pobres y estudiantes universitarios\".\n\n\"Pr\u00e1cticamente lo m\u00e1s interesante de este problema de fraude de votante e identificaci\u00f3n con foto es que se ha vuelto lamentablemente algo partidario\", seg\u00fan Kobach. \"Todos tenemos un inter\u00e9s en asegurarnos que las elecciones se hagan sin trampa\".\n\nEl autor Ari Berman dice que el derecho fundamental del voto est\u00e1 siendo amenazado.\n\n\"Si son los democr\u00e1tas los que se lo hacen a los republicanos o los republicanos a los dem\u00f3cratas, es un gran esc\u00e1ndalo que, en el 2018, haya gente teniendo problema para ejercer uno de los derechos fundamentales\", dice Berman, autor del libro \"Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America\".\n\nCientos de nuevas restricciones\n\nEs cada vez m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil votar en este pa\u00eds. Han sido presentadas cientos de nuevas restricciones en una mayor\u00eda de estados desde 2011. Y Estados Unidos se queda atr\u00e1s en participaci\u00f3n electoral comparado a otros pa\u00edses desarrollados.\n\n\"Deber\u00edamos incentivar la implementaci\u00f3n de medidas para facilitar el voto, lograr que la mayor cantidad de gente posible vaya a las urnas, en vez de restringirlo y hacer m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil que la gente vote\", argument\u00f3 el exsecretario de Justicia, Eric Holder.\n\nSe uni\u00f3 al expresidente Obama para crear el Comit\u00e9 Nacional de Reordenaci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tico, para reformar la manera en que son delineados los mapas de votaci\u00f3n de distritos. Es parte de un esfuerzo para eliminar la manipulaci\u00f3n de circunscripciones electorales partidarias, o lo que muchos denominan represi\u00f3n de votantes.\n\nKobach y otros defensores de leyes estrictas de votaci\u00f3n dicen que su objetivo \"no es intentar desincentivar la inscripci\u00f3n a uno u otro partido\", sino que buscan \"facilitar el voto y dificultar la trampa\".\n\nEl problema de la trampa est\u00e1 en el centro de la guerra contra los derechos de votaci\u00f3n. Hablamos con expertos e investigadores de elecciones en todo el mundo. Coinciden en que no hay ninguna evidencia de fraude de votante, ya sea por ciudadanos y no ciudadanos.\n\nAfirma que su misi\u00f3n es m\u00e1s grande\n\nKenneth Mayer, del Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n de Elecciones en la Universidad de Wisconsin-Madison, dice que \"es manifiestamente falso el argumento de que hubo fraude y suplantaci\u00f3n de votante\".\n\n\"Es un movimiento filos\u00f3fico en el que hay defensores que sostienen la existencia de niveles masivos de fraude de votante \u2013 por empezar el presidente, Kris Kobach, el secretario de Estado en Kansas - quienes han expresado fuertemente su apoyo, han insistido en que es un gran problema, y la gente termina creyendo eso\", dijo Mayer.\n\nEn Kansas, Kobach afirma que hay cientos de no ciudadanos en las listas de votantes. En 2015, convenci\u00f3 a la legislatura estatal de convertirlo en el \u00fanico secretario de Estado en el pa\u00eds que tiene el poder para procesar cr\u00edmenes electorales.\n\nEn los tres a\u00f1os desde que Kobach ha tenido la autoridad, 15 personas han sido acusadas de fraude electoral. 14 de ellas fueron condenadas, tres han sido no ciudadanas, incluyendo una que estaba en el proceso de convertirse en ciudadano naturalizado sin haber tomado juramento.\n\nSon tres no ciudadanos en el transcurso de varias elecciones en un estado con 1.800.000 de votantes inscritos.\n\nPero para Kobach, la misi\u00f3n es mucho m\u00e1s grande que unos pocos procesamientos. Afirma que esas cifras son solo la punta del iceberg.\n\n\u00c9l y los disc\u00edpulos de la \"integridad de votantes\" han jurado continuar con su cruzada en Estados Unidos.\n\nElise Zeiger, Jessica Small y Priscilla Thompson, todas de CNN, contribuyeron a este informe.", "\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0637\u0644\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u062b\u0627\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0643\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0648\u0648\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0648\u0631\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0625\u0646 \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0632\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u062e\u0631\u0637\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0636\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0643\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0646\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0637\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0643\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0647\u0627\u062a\u0641 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0628.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u060c 05 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Joshua A.

He is the author of the forthcoming book Vote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting . Find him at www.joshuaadouglas.com and follow him on Twitter @JoshuaADouglas .\n\n(CNN) American democracy is exceptional for many reasons. One of the most concerning but least understood is that partisan, elected officials run our elections. Instead of having nonpartisan, professional election administrators -- the norm in most other democracies -- self-interested politicians dictate the rules of the game.\n\nElections should be won on ideas, not election rules. Having election officials dictate the rules for the very elections where they are on the ballot is like allowing an umpire in a baseball game to hit cleanup for his or her preferred team while also calling balls and strikes.\n\nThree secretaries of state are running for higher office this year while still administering the elections where they appear on the ballot. Republican Brian Kemp of Georgia and Republican Kris Kobach of Kansas are both running for governor in their respective states while also serving as secretary of state. Ohio Secretary of State Republican Jon Husted of Ohio is running for lieutenant governor.\n\nThese officials have used their offices to promulgate rules that could affect their elections.\n\nThe latest partisan abuse has come from Georgia's Kemp, whose office on Sunday indicated that it had opened an investigation into state Democrats for \"possible cyber crimes.\" Even if there is any merit to the allegations -- and it's impossible to know from the secretary of state office's brief statement, though indications are that it's actually Kemp's office that has been lax in the security of its system -- it is highly improper for a politician to use his official office to attack his political foe in this way, all while in a heated race for the state's top job.\n\nThis action follows Kemp's office potentially disenfranchising thousands of voters by placing their registrations in a \"pending\" status because the voter registration forms did not \"exactly match\" other information in the state's databases, such as when a last name had a hyphen on the voter registration form but not in the DMV database. The rule disproportionately affects racial minorities, which is particularly concerning given that Kemp is running against Stacy Abrams, who seeks to become the nation's first African-American female governor. A court last week ruled that Kemp must allow thousands of these individuals, flagged for potentially being noncitizens, to vote if they can prove their citizenship at the polls.\n\nKansas's Kobach, too, has used the power of his office to increase his electoral chances. After the August primary, when the count was exceedingly close between Kobach and incumbent Governor Jeff Colyer, Kobach initially refused to recuse himself from overseeing the recount of that election. Kobach was going to be in charge of a recount that would determine the winner in an election in which he was a candidate! He later agreed to recuse, but only after public outcry.\n\nKobach has also used unsupported fears of voter fraud, with zero evidence, to advocate for stricter election measures that would make it harder for many people to vote. Not surprisingly, those most affected by these voter restrictions are those who would likely oppose him at the ballot box. But advocating for certain election rules is one thing; dictating the rules in an election when he is a candidate presents a whole different set of ethical concerns.\n\nOhio's Husted has been less overt in using election rules to affect his election, but he did fight a lawsuit that challenged the state's aggressive voter purge system, winning a case at the Supreme Court this past June. However, a court last week ruled that the state must count provisional ballots from some voters who did not receive proper notice that the state was purging them from the rolls, and Husted did not appeal the decision given how close it was to Election Day.\n\nFor a public servant, the line not to cross is clear: Election officials should not determine rules that would affect their own elections. If Kemp and Kobach were to look over their shoulders, they would see that line far behind them.\n\nYet the problem is not limited to these two Republican election officials. More than half of the states choose their chief election official (most often the secretary of state) in a partisan election. Most local election officials, who actually run the elections in their localities, are also partisan and elected. These officials are typically highly professional and simply want to run a fair election. But the very nature of their office as being partisan and elected opens the door to potential bias.\n\nNo wonder a majority of the public supports election officials to be nonpartisan.\n\nTo maintain the fairness and sanctity of our elections, Kemp, Kobach and Husted must all agree, before Election Day, that they will recuse themselves from any electoral issues, including recounts, involving their own elections. As the European Commission for Democracy Through Law (Venice Commission) notes , \"Only transparency, impartiality and independence from politically motivated manipulation will ensure proper administration of the election process, from the pre-election period to the end of the processing of results.\"\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMoving forward, states and localities should change their laws so that secretaries of states and local election officials are explicitly nonpartisan officials not subject to elections where they can dictate the rules for their own elections.\n\nVoters, too, can play an important role. Regardless of party, vote for secretary of state candidates who pledge to be nonpartisan champions of voting rights. There are individuals who, if elected, will put the needs of voters and their role as public servants above their partisan and personal gain. That's who should run our elections.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl rejuvenecimiento vaginal y la labiaplastia fueron las de mayor crecimiento en el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o\n\nLas cirug\u00edas est\u00e9ticas que m\u00e1s se hicieron en el mundo fueron el aumento de pecho y la liposucci\u00f3n\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Aunque Estados Unidos es el pa\u00eds donde m\u00e1s cirug\u00edas est\u00e9ticas se practican en el mundo, hay tres pa\u00edses latinoamericanos entre los m\u00e1s destacados en esta pr\u00e1ctica, seg\u00fan un reporte de la Sociedad Internacional de Cirug\u00eda Pl\u00e1stica Est\u00e9tica (ISAPS).\n\nUna encuesta global hecha por la ISAPS, una organizaci\u00f3n mundial de cirujanos est\u00e9ticos que tiene m\u00e1s de 4000 miembros en 105 pa\u00edses, revel\u00f3 que en 2017 hubo un aumento del 5% de las cirug\u00edas pl\u00e1sticas y tratamientos est\u00e9ticos sin intervenci\u00f3n, en todo el mundo, y la mayor\u00eda de ellas se realiz\u00f3 en EE.UU. (18,4%), Brasil (10,4%), Jap\u00f3n (7,2%), M\u00e9xico (4,4%), Italia (4,1%), Alemania (3%), Colombia (2,2%) y Tailandia (0,5%).\n\nEstados Unidos se presenta como el pa\u00eds donde m\u00e1s intervenciones est\u00e9ticas se hacen debido a su gran cantidad de poblaci\u00f3n y del llamado turismo m\u00e9dico interno, le explic\u00f3 a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol la doctora Lina Triana, primera vicepresidenta de la Sociedad Internacional de Cirug\u00eda Pl\u00e1stica Est\u00e9tica.\n\nSeg\u00fan ella, esta encuesta mide la cantidad de procedimientos que se hacen fuera del lugar de origen de los pacientes, y en Estados Unidos hay muchos pacientes que viajan internamente para hacerse cirug\u00edas pl\u00e1sticas. Por eso lideran en este ranking.\n\nY en Am\u00e9rica Latina, las cirug\u00edas est\u00e9ticas pueden explicarse desde varios puntos de vista; uno de ellos, desde lo cultural:\n\n\"Nosotros tenemos una cultura en Latinoam\u00e9rica donde las mujeres, dig\u00e1moslo, son un poquito m\u00e1s abiertas, vivimos en un clima tropical m\u00e1s tiempo del a\u00f1o en muchas ciudades, estamos en los tr\u00f3picos, entonces esto hace que las personas usen ropa m\u00e1s descubierta y esto hace que nosotros en estas regiones estemos haciendo cirug\u00eda pl\u00e1stica est\u00e9tica desde hace muchos a\u00f1os en unos vol\u00famenes m\u00e1s altos que en otras partes\", le dijo la doctora Lina Triana a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol desde Miami.\n\nTambi\u00e9n se ha visto un aumento de la calidad de los procedimientos est\u00e9ticos en estos pa\u00edses, algo que, acompa\u00f1ado del favorecimiento del cambio de la moneda, hace que estos destinos sean atractivos para el turismo m\u00e9dico.\n\n\"Hoy en d\u00eda vemos que si bien el cambio de la moneda favorece por ejemplo a Colombia para que s\u00ed sea un poco m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mico, la principal raz\u00f3n por la que viajan ya no es porque eran con menor costo, sino porque tambi\u00e9n encuentran calidad de procedimientos, de centros donde realizan procedimientos est\u00e9ticos lo cual es algo muy positivo\", dijo Triana.\n\n\"Obviamente el cambio de la moneda siempre favorece\", a\u00f1adi\u00f3 la experta que tambi\u00e9n se desempe\u00f1\u00f3 como presidenta de la Sociedad Colombiana de Cirug\u00eda Pl\u00e1stica Est\u00e9tica y Reconstructiva (2014-2015).\n\nSeg\u00fan Renato Saltz, presidente de la ISAPS, es probable que esta tendencia de las cirug\u00edas est\u00e9ticas aumente en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os.\n\n\u201cSer\u00e1 muy interesante comparar estos datos con los resultados de 2018, puesto que estamos viendo cifras r\u00e9cord de pacientes que aprovechan las \u00faltimas innovaciones en cirug\u00eda est\u00e9tica para verse y sentirse mejor\u201d, dijo Saltz en un comunicado.\n\nLos procedimientos que m\u00e1s se practicaron en el mundo\n\nEl reporte m\u00e1s reciente mostr\u00f3 que entre estos ocho destinos se realizaron m\u00e1s de 23,3 millones de procedimientos quir\u00fargicos y 12,6 millones de procedimientos no quir\u00fargicos.\n\nEl reporte mostr\u00f3 que el tratamiento cosm\u00e9tico que m\u00e1s crecimiento tuvo en 2017 fue el rejuvenecimiento vaginal, incluida la labiaplastia, una cirug\u00eda cosm\u00e9tica que altera la apariencia de los genitales de la mujer, espec\u00edficamente sus labios menores y mayores. Esta pr\u00e1ctica aument\u00f3 un 23% en 2017 respecto a 2016.\n\n\"Hoy la mujer quiera ser l\u00edder en su vida sexual\", dice Triana sobre la raz\u00f3n del aumento de las cirug\u00edas vaginales.

Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman . The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) If there is one foreign policy objective to which Donald Trump is unalterably committed, it is bringing the Iranian theocracy to its knees -- or at least thwarting its nuclear ambitions.\n\nThis is the reason the President, against the advice of all of America's leading allies, has clamped new and potentially existential sanctions on Iran for violating a treaty that the world believes it has respected to the letter if not the spirit.\n\nBut if he is to achieve this demolition of the Iranian system, it is becoming quite clear that Trump will have to accept Mohammed bin Salman, widely accused as the mastermind behind the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia with all that entails for a generation to come. And that entails quite a lot. MBS denies he ordered the killing.\n\nThe resolution of a host of problems in the Middle East -- especially Iran, Qatar and the endless war in Yemen -- revolves around Western, and especially American, acceptance of Saudi Arabia's deeply felt need for security.\n\nThe road to this security runs directly through the vicious, uncompromising hegemony of Mohammad bin Salman. That's the conclusion of Ali Shihabi, founder of the Washington-based Arabia Foundation, who, according to journalist and scholar Thomas Lippman, often unofficially speaks authoritatively for Saudi Arabia's ruling al-Saud family.\n\nShihabi believes that all too many of the recent moves by MBS, as he is known inside and outside the kingdom, have been deeply flawed.\n\nBut he also observes that \"the crown prince has never pretended to be a political reformer,\" which is not entirely true.\n\nIndeed, his pretensions at being just a such a reformer\u2014allowing women to drive, opening cinemas\u2014are what particularly endeared him to a broad, even bipartisan swath of Washington.\n\nBut Shihabi, in an effort to clarify, observes correctly: \"He is the Crown Prince of an absolute monarchy who understands that economic and social transformation is essential to safeguarding the future of his country and who believes that such change in a deeply polarized country like Saudi Arabia can only come from the top.\"\n\nIn short, Shahibi concedes, in his extraordinary document , MBS \"is not a Jeffersonian democrat,\" but has the Saudis' ultimate security at heart.\n\nJUST WATCHED What happened to Jamal Khashoggi?: A timeline Replay More Videos ...

The cost will undoubtedly be a heavy one -- especially after Monday, as Trump snaps back sanctions against Iran that had been lifted after that nation signed the agreement sharply restricting its nuclear ambitions.\n\nTo make these stick, Trump needed some other ally. Along came Saudi Arabia -- and especially MBS.\n\nThe price of MBS' support has turned out to to be a high one. There was free rein for the Crown Prince to do as he liked whenever he desired.\n\nNot everyone, of course agreed with this assessment.\n\nThen there was bin Salman's blockade of Qatar, home to the powerful Al Jazeera news channel and ruled by a monarch who's been ill-inclined to toe the Saudi line.\n\nFinally, the brutal war in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia pursues in the face of virtually every international plea.\n\nJUST WATCHED Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies 02:52\n\nBut it is Iran that holds the gravest potential as a long-term, irreversible crisis. Should Iran see the latest turn of the screw by the Trump administration and his Saudi backers as an existential threat, scrap the nuclear accord and return full-tilt to building a nuclear arsenal, there will be no putting that genie back in the bottle.\n\nThe principal problem is that all sides at this point just can't seem to be able to get out of their own way.\n\nSaudi Arabia has simply ignored even the Trump administration's call for a ceasefire in Yemen.\n\nAt the same time, Iranian agents were accused of an assassination plot against a regime foe in Denmark, outraging the European community , which has bitterly opposed Trump's renewal of American sanctions on Iran.\n\nWhat the world really needs is for someone to become the adult in the room. Ideally, that person should be Donald Trump.\n\nYet somehow, when the President gets on the phone to talk with the aging, but still supremely powerful King Salman, Trump seems to lose all sense of reason.\n\nThe conversations are invariably wonderful and productive. \"Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened 'to our Saudi Arabian citizen,'\" Trump tweeted last month at the height of the Khashoggi crisis.\n\nOf course, it's possible that someone else is sitting on the other end of these calls along with the King -- perhaps his son, who is utterly out of control. A White House official said they do not discuss arrangements for top-level phone calls.\n\nIt's now past the time when we need to know with certainty who's minding the store. It's too late and the stakes are too high for us to plunge blindly into the abyss.", "Washington (CNN) Early voting continues to be explosive, as an energized American electorate weighs in on its government.\n\nAs of early Tuesday morning, at least 33 million people have voted early nationwide, according to data collected by Catalist, a data company that works with Democrats and others, to compile counts of ballots cast before Election Day, either early in-person or by mail.\n\nThat's far more than the 22 million early votes cast in the entire 2014 election.\n\nThe data suggests an electorate deeply engaged in voters' first real opportunity to offer a verdict on the presidency of Donald Trump, who has actively tried to turn the election into a referendum on himself.\n\nEncouraging signs for Democrats include a clear surge in young and first-time voters in the early voting data and a larger percentage of women voters, who have appeared supportive of Democrats in recent national polls.\n\nAlso, in states where party identification is available, Democrats are a larger portion of the early voting electorate than they were in 2014.\n\nIt's important not to draw conclusions from the data. The country has been moving toward a more robust use of early voting for years. It's also not clear if the early vote in key states is showing up to support Trump and Republicans or Democrats.\n\nBut it is certainly true that at least 33 states have eclipsed their early voting totals from this point in 2014, according to Catalist.\n\nEven amid controversies over voting in Georgia, Brian Kemp, Georgia's secretary of state and Republican candidate for governor, recently announced the state has not only broken its 2014 record, but has set a new, all-time record for early voting in a midterm election.\n\nNationally, the early vote is lower than it was in 2016 -- not surprising given presidential years tend to see larger turnouts than midterm elections.\n\nBut several states are already approaching their 2016 early vote totals, and New Jersey and West Virginia have now surpassed them.\n\nAge\n\nThe Catalist records show the share of early voters under the age of 30 has increased substantially this year in many states, compared to the previous cycles.\n\nIn at least 12 states, voters under 30 make up a larger percent of the early vote this cycle than they did in 2014.\n\nIn four states -- Texas, Georgia, Nevada and New Jersey -- the share of the youth vote under 30 this cycle has roughly doubled compared with 2014.\n\nCheck out what's happened in Texas and Georgia, for instance:\n\nThe strength of the under-30 voting bloc also extends beyond the vote share, to the sheer number of voters in several states.\n\nIn Texas, for instance, more than 480,000 people under the age of 30 have now cast early ballots, compared to about 550,000 at this point in the presidential election last time, in 2016 -- a difference of only about 11%.\n\nIn West Virginia, there is only an 8% difference between the number of early votes this year compared with 2016.\n\nAnd in New Jersey, there have now been more people under 30 voting early than there were in the presidential race two years ago -- up more than 800 votes, or about 2%.\n\nFirst-timers\n\nThe records also allow for examining which early voters have registered to vote for the first time -- at least for 2018 (previous years were not available).\n\nIn North Dakota and Nevada, 11% of the early voting electorate are first-time voters. By contrast, in Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey and West Virginia, first-time voters only comprise between 3% and 5% of early voting.\n\nGender\n\nWomen continue to outpace men in early voting in every state where Catalist provided data to CNN.\n\nParty registration\n\nThe records provided by Catalist to CNN include party registration for early vote tallies in select states.\n\n(Those numbers reflect a count of the voter's party affiliation, but do not indicate who a voter actually chose on the ballot.)\n\nWhile most states are on par with the party breakdown of previous cycles, which generally favor Republicans, Democrats have made gains in several notable places since 2014.\n\nIn Nevada and Florida, for example, Democrats have actually pulled ahead of Republicans as a share of the early vote this time.\n\nSome key states do not have party registration information at all -- such as Texas and Georgia.\n\nThe data in this story has been updated.", "(CNN) The man police say was driving a truck that killed three Girl Scouts and a woman in Wisconsin had been \"huffing,\" or intentionally inhaling chemical fumes, police said Monday.\n\nColten Treu\n\nThe woman was the mother of one of the girls killed Saturday, police said.\n\nColten R.

Indeed, the best estimate is that Republicans will end up with just 19 of the governorships up for grabs on Tuesday to the Democrats' 17. Perhaps more importantly, Democrats are in a position to control the top position in potentially nine of the 10 most populated states.\n\nNow you may be wondering why governors' races matter. Let me give you one reason.\n\nIn a number of states, the strong Democratic performance in governor's races will help them when it comes to the next round of redistricting after the 2020 Census. In the last decade, Republican governors helped draw lines that were more favorable to Republicans. The result was that more Republicans were able to win House races that they might not otherwise been able to.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nMayweather Jr. es uno de los mejores boxeadores de todos los tiempos\n\nLa pelea est\u00e1 programada para el 31 de diciembre\n\nNo se define a\u00fan si la pelea ser\u00e1 bajo las reglas del boxeo o de las artes marciales mixtas\n\n(Bleacher Report) - El boxeador Floyd Mayweather Jr. pelear\u00e1 contra el kickboxer japon\u00e9s Tenshin Nasukawa, inform\u00f3 Dan Rafael de ESPN.com.\n\nA\u00fan no se sabe si la pelea ser\u00e1 bajo las reglas del boxeo o de las artes marciales mixtas.\n\nSeg\u00fan Ariel Helwani de ESPN, las reglas a\u00fan se est\u00e1n definiendo.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo ser\u00e1 la pelea entre Mayweather y Nasukawa?\n\nLa pelea est\u00e1 programada para el 31 de diciembre en el Saitama Super Arena, en Saitama, Jap\u00f3n.\n\nMayweather Jr. es uno de los mejores boxeadores de todos los tiempos, con un r\u00e9cord de 50-0 en su carrera profesional.\n\nAsimismo, en su \u00faltima pelea venci\u00f3 a Connor McGregor, luchador de artes marciales mixtas, bajo las reglas del boxeo.\n\nNasukawa solo tiene 20 a\u00f1os, pero ya se ha ganado una reputaci\u00f3n como uno de los mejores competidores en este deporte.

and Prevention said Monday.\n\nIn addition, there are 139 cases under investigation for a total of 219 confirmed and suspected.\n\nThis is eight more confirmed cases than the agency reported last week and 20 additional patients under investigation.\n\nThe CDC noted an increase in reports of patients under investigation who began experiencing symptoms in August, September and October. It has not identified the 25 states with confirmed illnesses, nor has it said how many states are reporting cases under investigation.\n\nAFM, or acute flaccid myelitis, is a rare illness that affects the nervous system, especially the gray matter in the spinal cord, and can cause muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis. Last month, the CDC said that 90% of patients since 2014 have been children under the age of 4, although adults can also develop AFM.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's decision to deploy US active duty troops and earlier deployment of National Guard forces to the southern border could cost between $200 million and $300 million, according to an independent analysis and Department of Defense figures on guard deployments.\n\nThe Pentagon has yet to determine the cost of the operation, nor has it identified the account where the funding would come from. But the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimates that the cost of placing active duty troops on the border could range from $42 million to $110 million.\n\nThat would be in addition to an estimated cost of $182 million for the already announced deployment of National Guard troops to the border in May.\n\nCSBA says that on the high end, the deployment would cost $143 per troop per day for operating and maintenance costs and $112 per troop per day on the low end. CSBA also estimates that the use of military aircraft in this deployment would cost about $136,645 per day.\n\nWith the mission currently set to take place November 5 through December 15, for a total of 41 days, the cost of deploying 8,000 troops and air support ranges from approximately $42 million to $55 million, according to the CSBA estimate.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl dinosaurio era un cuadr\u00fapedo herb\u00edvoro de cuello largo y cola larga\n\nSe cree que habit\u00f3 la regi\u00f3n argentina hace unos 110 millones de a\u00f1os\n\nLa nueva especie fue hallada en la provincia de Neuqu\u00e9n\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Una nueva especie de dinosaurio ha sido descubierta en un lugar de Argentina en el que no se esperaban encontrar f\u00f3siles, inform\u00f3 la Agencia Ciencia, Tecnolog\u00eda y Sociedad de la Universidad de la Matanza (CTyS-UNLaM).\n\n\n\n\"El cr\u00e1neo est\u00e1 pr\u00e1cticamente completo\", dijo el doctor Jos\u00e9 Luis Carballido, investigador del Museo Egidio Feruglio en Argentina, a la agencia.\n\nLa nueva especie fue hallada en la provincia de Neuqu\u00e9n, fue llamada Lavocatisaurus agrioensis y se cree que habit\u00f3 la regi\u00f3n argentina hace unos 110 millones de a\u00f1os.

De hecho, la econom\u00eda centroamericana se beneficia considerablemente de las remesas recibidas gracias a la emigraci\u00f3n, llegando este ingreso a tener gran importancia en el Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) de estos pa\u00edses de Centroam\u00e9rica y el Caribe. De acuerdo con datos que el Banco Mundial analiza conjuntamente con las estimaciones del PIB que realiza el FMI y la OCDE, en el caso de Honduras, el aporte de sus migrantes signific\u00f3 un 18,81% en 2017.\n\nEn cuanto a El Salvador, hablamos del 20,37% y en Guatemala encontramos un 11,18%. Este es el impacto que las remesas tienen en el Tri\u00e1ngulo Norte Centroamericano, como es llamada esta zona.\n\nEl peso de las remesas es a\u00fan mayor en la naci\u00f3n caribe\u00f1a de Hait\u00ed, cuya econom\u00eda en 2017 dependi\u00f3 en 29,25% de los env\u00edos de sus nacionales en el extranjero, frente a un 7,8% de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, cuyo porcentaje, aunque mucho menor, sigue siendo una dependencia importante para cualquier econom\u00eda. En 2017, Rep\u00fablica Dominicana fue el pa\u00eds que mostr\u00f3 mayor crecimiento de remesas con un ingreso de US$ 5.912 millones y un crecimiento anual del 12,4%.\n\nHicimos este pre\u00e1mbulo econ\u00f3mico porque los n\u00fameros hablan y si no entendemos su relaci\u00f3n de causa y efecto, as\u00ed como las variables y los factores que determinan este comportamiento no entenderemos la raz\u00f3n por la cual esta caravana se inici\u00f3 en Honduras, en el centro de la regi\u00f3n que es considerada la m\u00e1s desigual del mundo: Am\u00e9rica Latina.\n\nTampoco es casualidad que San Pedro Sula, ciudad que se destaca por ser el centro de operaci\u00f3n de las empresas industriales m\u00e1s importantes de Honduras \u2014tambi\u00e9n conocida por ser una de las ciudades m\u00e1s peligrosas del mundo\u2014 haya sido el epicentro que sirvi\u00f3 de arranque para esta traves\u00eda con dimensi\u00f3n de crisis humanitaria. En el ranking de 2014 que public\u00f3 la ONG mexicana Consejo Ciudadano para la Seguridad P\u00fablica, San Pedro Sula fue la ciudad menos segura del mundo por cuarto a\u00f1o consecutivo. Es decir, una persona en la favela de Alemao en Brasil, estaba m\u00e1s segura que una en Honduras. En 2016, Caracas, capital de Venezuela, se consolid\u00f3 en el primer lugar del mundo en esta lista deshonrosa.\n\nEste flujo masivo de migrantes fue la \u00fanica salida que esta gente encontr\u00f3 a tres flagelos que ven\u00edan atac\u00e1ndola: violencia, pobreza y corrupci\u00f3n. En el caso de Honduras, pa\u00eds que, despu\u00e9s de Hait\u00ed, es uno de los m\u00e1s pobres del hemisferio, su pobreza en parte encuentra su causa en fen\u00f3menos como la corrupci\u00f3n. Este nivel de pobreza ya ha sido analizado por la Comisi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe (Cepal). Todo esto, sumado al descontento social, es el caldo de cultivo que necesita un pueblo para encontrar la soluci\u00f3n menos convencional a sus problemas.\n\nNo olvidemos que las instituciones hondure\u00f1as a\u00fan se recuperan del golpe de Estado a Manuel Zelaya en 2009 y que apenas en 2017, la democracia del pa\u00eds estuvo a prueba tras los resultados de los comicios que en las que fue reelegido presidente Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez frente a Salvador Nasralla. En esa ocasi\u00f3n, la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos pidi\u00f3 elecciones nuevas. El oficialismo hab\u00eda logrado permanecer en el poder a pesar de que la Constituci\u00f3n prohib\u00eda la reelecci\u00f3n presidencial. Con una decisi\u00f3n del Tribunal Electoral, Hern\u00e1ndez logr\u00f3 lo que no pudo Zelaya con el refer\u00e9ndum que contribuy\u00f3 a su ca\u00edda. Todo esto hace que el origen de esta caravana migratoria sea multifactorial.\n\nEn cuanto a El Salvador, el crimen organizado es una cuesti\u00f3n seria, pues desde la guerra civil el pa\u00eds viene luchando con el problema de las pandillas, conocidas popularmente como \u201cmaras\u201d, agrupaciones criminales que hacen que la vida del salvadore\u00f1o sea un calvario al que unos ya se acostumbran y se imponen un \u201cautotoque\u201d de queda para evitar ser asaltados, mientras que otros deciden salir del pa\u00eds hacia otro m\u00e1s seguro. En un lugar tan peque\u00f1o como El Salvador, ya en 2015 el ministro de la Defensa, David Mungu\u00eda, lleg\u00f3 a plantear que estas pandillas superaban en n\u00famero a sus cuerpos de seguridad.\n\nGuatemala, pa\u00eds que forma parte de la ruta de la caravana, no obtiene buena calificaci\u00f3n en los temas que afectan a El Salvador y Honduras, pues en el Informe Nacional de Pr\u00e1cticas de Derechos Humanos de 2017, realizado por el Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos, los aspectos de corrupci\u00f3n y violencia quedaron muy resaltados. Como hemos mencionado antes, el trinomio violencia-pobreza-corrupci\u00f3n ha desencadenado en migraciones, pero hay que destacar que antes del 13 de octubre esto era m\u00e1s evidente en los venezolanos que escapan de la situaci\u00f3n de su pa\u00eds, especialmente hacia el sur. Un venezolano debe caminar 8.000 km a pie para llegar a Argentina y son muchos los que se ven obligados a hacerlo.\n\nLa corrupci\u00f3n en Am\u00e9rica Latina sigue siendo una asignatura sin resolver. La organizaci\u00f3n Transparencia Internacional (TI), en su informe anual global para el a\u00f1o 2017, refleja c\u00f3mo Am\u00e9rica Latina queda reprobada en la percepci\u00f3n de corrupci\u00f3n. En una escala de 0 a 100, Nueva Zelandia obtiene 89 puntos y en las Am\u00e9ricas, vemos a Canad\u00e1 que saca la cara con 82 puntos, mientras que en Centroam\u00e9rica tenemos a Nicaragua con 26, Guatemala con 28, Honduras con 29 y El Salvador con 33.\n\nEn esta medici\u00f3n, Venezuela (18) ocupa el puesto de mayor corrupci\u00f3n, solo seguido por Hait\u00ed (22). Un dato curioso que Nicaragua comparte con Azerbaiy\u00e1n, un pa\u00eds muy lejos en Asia, es el hecho de que en ambas naciones el puesto de la vicepresidencia y el cargo de primera dama, est\u00e1n ocupados por una misma persona, la esposa del presidente. Esto env\u00eda un claro mensaje sobre el deterioro de las instituciones reflejado en el fen\u00f3meno del nepotismo. La corrupci\u00f3n es el s\u00edntoma com\u00fan de la regi\u00f3n que atenta contra su propio crecimiento. En 2016, el FMI se\u00f1al\u00f3 que la corrupci\u00f3n le cuesta al mundo un 2% de su PIB, yo me atrevo a pensar que debe ser un poco m\u00e1s. Este dinero que se escapa no crea empleos y sin empleos las personas emigran.\n\nAl escuchar las historias personales de aquellos que se encuentran marchando por el camino de lo que ellos interpretan como la b\u00fasqueda de la paz, la seguridad ciudadana y el progreso econ\u00f3mico, nos damos cuenta que esta sencilla, pero poderosa formula que suma los factores corrupci\u00f3n, violencia y pobreza, nos da como resultado la emigraci\u00f3n y presenta un m\u00ednimo com\u00fan denominador en la gran mayor\u00eda de estos migrantes: la aspiraci\u00f3n por una mejor vida para ellos, sus hijos y los familiares que han dejado atr\u00e1s.\n\nL\u00f3gicamente, como migrantes que son, est\u00e1n conscientes de que en tierras ajenas no siempre ser\u00e1n recibidos como en casa, pero tambi\u00e9n saben que en naciones que se rigen por el imperio de la Ley y que cuentan con instituciones s\u00f3lidas \u2013 al menos m\u00e1s fuertes que aquellas de sus pa\u00edses\u2013 el que trabaja honradamente alcanza el progreso y logra echar su familia hacia adelante porque en la tierra de las oportunidades los limites vienen determinados por el nivel de esfuerzo personal que cada uno pone para superarse.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN) -

stopped the Trump campaign from running its racist anti-immigration commercial as an ad on the site.\n\n\"This ad violates Facebook's advertising policy against sensational content so we are rejecting it. While the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook, it cannot receive paid distribution,\" Facebook said in a statement Monday afternoon.\n\nThe move came shortly after NBC and Fox News said they would stop airing the ad across their networks. CNN had previously determined that the ad is racist and declined to sell airtime for it.\n\nThe Trump campaign began running the ad on Facebook on Sunday, targeting voters in Florida and Arizona. By Monday morning, it had reached millions of users on the platform.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said the ad had been allowed to run in error.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Here's what you might have missed Monday on CNN:\n\n-- The United States officially reimposed all penalties that had been lifted as part of the Iranian nuclear deal as the Trump administration added nearly 700 targets, including 50 Iranian financial institutions, to a sanctions list.\n\n-- A new statue of Liverpool star Mo Salah was unveiled in his native Egypt and quickly had football fans on social media in stitches.\n\n-- More than 31 million votes have been cast early or by mail nationwide, according to data collected by Catalist. If you weren't one of the early birds, here's everything you need to know about the midterm elections.\n\n-- Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. will fight kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa on New Year's Eve in Japan.", "New York (CNN Business) 7-Eleven is trying to speed up checkouts to keep pace with rivals.\n\nThe world's largest convenience chain is piloting a self-checkout feature on its mobile app at 14 stores in Dallas. 7-Eleven's scan-and-pay option will allow customers to ring up Slurpees and snacks without waiting in line. Purchases will be linked to 7-Eleven's loyalty rewards program.\n\n7-Eleven ( SVNDF ) has around 11,800 stores in North America, and it plans to expand scan-and-pay to more stores.\n\nThe test comes as big retailers, including Walmart ( WMT ), Target ( TGT ), and Dollar General ( DG ), are experimenting with different ways to make checking out easier for shoppers in stores through apps. Walmart and Target are stationing employees with mobile scanners in high-traffic aisles during the holidays.\n\n7-Eleven is also responding to Amazon ( AMZN ) and Walmart's expansion of cashierless stores. Amazon reportedly is considering plans to open up to 3,000 cashierless Amazon Go stores by 2021.\n\nWalmart is also testing a cashierless Sam's Club Now store in Dallas. Sam's Club Now is 32,000 square feet, a quarter of the size of a regular Sam's Club, and will sell mostly fresh food and alcohol. The idea for the store evolved from the Sam's Club Scan and Go app, which lets customers scan barcodes and pay directly within its app.\n\nThese new concepts are a direct threat to convenience and fast-food chains. To target younger shoppers and retouch their images, 7-Eleven, Cumberland Farms and Wawa are redesigning stores and improving fresh food and drink selections.\n\n\"This is 7-Eleven's play at amplifying convenience,\" said Catherine Lang, an analyst at Kantar Consulting who researches discount and convenience stores. \"They're feeling pressure from Amazon in fresh food.\"\n\n7-Eleven has not announced any plans for cashier-free stores. She expects 7-Eleven to roll out mobile ordering on its app next.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629

The bulging biceps, long hair and headband remain, but the Spaniard's sense of style has certainly changed. Hide Caption 1 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2005 \u2013 Nadal went into his first French Open as an inexperienced 18-year-old and emerged a grand slam champion -- beating Roger Federer in the semifinals on his 19th birthday. The 2005 season was the birth of what would go on to be Nadal's classic look: sleeveless top and three-quarter length shorts. Hide Caption 2 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2006 \u2013 By the following year, Nadal had cemented his place among tennis' elite and was developing a fearsome reputation on clay. This time wearing a slightly less garish light blue, Nadal picked up his second consecutive French Open title by becoming the first man to beat Roger Federer in a grand slam final. Hide Caption 3 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2007 \u2013 In 2007, the then 20-year-old Nadal's status as the 'King of Clay' was sealed. Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today. At that year's French Open, Nadal opted for the reverse of 2006's top-bandana combo -- this time with matching trainers to boot. Hide Caption 4 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2008 \u2013 A year later, Nadal opted for a variation on his debut French Option look, this time sporting an all-green combo. Nadal reached world No. 1 for the first time in his career in 2008, helped by his fourth consecutive Roland Garros title -- matching Bjorn Borg's record of consecutive trophies, while also becoming only the seventh man to win a grand slam without dropping a set. Hide Caption 5 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2009 \u2013 Nadal's first dramatic transformation came in 2009. Gone were the sleeveless shirts and three-quarter lengths, in came the sleeves and fluorescent, clashing colors. Perhaps it was the sleeves restricting the powerful arms (or maybe a knee injury), but Nadal suffered the first of only two French Open defeats. Despite a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling, Nadal set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros. Hide Caption 6 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2010 \u2013 In 2010, Nadal bounced back from the 2009 disappointment with a daring multicolored number. He went on to exact revenge on Soderling, beating him in the final after the Swede had upset Federer in the quarterfinals. Federer's failure to reach the semis meant Nadal regained the world No. 1 spot, while it was also the second time he won the French Open without dropping a set. Hide Caption 7 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2011 \u2013 The following year, Nadal dialed down the brightness, instead choosing to return to one of his earliest Roland Garros styles. And it worked -- he maintained his No. 1 ranking throughout the clay court season and beat perennial rival Federer in the final. Hide Caption 8 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2012 \u2013 Perhaps in an attempt to gain the upper hand on opponents by blending into the clay, Nadal opted for an orange-ish-red look for the first time at the French Open. It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player. Hide Caption 9 of 14\n\nPhotos: The King of Clay over the years 2013 \u2013 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.

Despite being hampered by injuries and suffering surprise defeats early in the clay court season, Nadal grinded out arguably his most impressive Roland Garros victory. Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.

Looking like an athletic version of the Cookie Monster, Nadal crashed out of the French Open in the quarterfinals to Djokovic. It ended his 39-match unbeaten run and marked just his second defeat on the Parisian clay.

Click to subscribe!\n\nWhich sounds less awesome. Because, um, it is less awesome. The whole idea of our beautiful experiment in democracy is that people -- all, or at least most -- participate in it. But a look back at the history of midterm elections makes one thing very clear: A majority of people who are eligible to vote don't traditionally exercise that right.\n\nIn the last midterm election -- 2014 -- just over 36% of the voting eligible population actually voted. That's the lowest percentage turnout in more than. In 36 states, turnout went down from where it was in 2010.\n\nWhile 2014 was bad, it's not as though 2010 was all that much better. Just over 40% of eligible voters actually cast ballots in that one. The story was the same in 2006 (40.4%) and 2002 (39.5%).\n\n(Sidebar: Presidential year turnout is higher, but it's still not even close to 100% of the voting eligible population. The highest voter turnout in the last four presidential elections was in 2008, when just over 58% of the voting eligible population turned out -- choosing Barack Obama to beat John McCain. The highest presidential turnout since World War II was in 1960, when almost 63% of eligible voters turned out in the race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.)\n\nThose lackluster voting numbers are in spite of the fact that 37 states now offer early voting , meaning you can cast a ballot days or sometimes even weeks before Election Day.\n\nSo, what gives? Why do more than 60% of the people who could vote in a midterm election choose not to? Here's a few of the BIGGEST reasons:\n\n1. Apathy\n\n\"These are the midterms,\" Trump said in Missouri over the weekend. \"Nobody thought of the midterms as being that big a deal for years. For years. Nobody thought of the midterms. You know, you hear midterms, it's like let's go to sleep, right?\"\n\nSadly, yes. While the presidential race is the sort of big-ticket item filled with drama that Americans tend to be drawn to, the midterms are less, well, sexy. Sure, there's the Texas race between Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D). And the Florida and Georgia governors races. But for the most part these are races where very few people outside of a district or a state know who is even running.\n\nWhile control of Congress matters -- A LOT -- the casual voter tends to feel a little \"meh\" about the idea of waiting in a line to vote for candidates that they may barely know.\n\n2. Voting rules\n\nThe biggest impediment to voting is not registering to vote. Unlike some other countries around the world, the United States doesn't automatically register people to vote when they turn 18 and are, therefore, eligible to vote.\n\nLots and lots of people who COULD vote don't register to vote and so when Election Day comes they are left out of the process. There are 17 states -- plus the District of Columbia -- where you can register on the same day that you vote. But that means there are 33 states where same-day registration isn't available -- and each of those states have specific and unique rules when it comes to how to register.\n\nWhat's fascinating is that IF you can get someone registered to vote, there is a VERY good chance they will actually, you know, vote. Studies have shown that somewhere around 90% of people who are registered to vote actually DO vote\n\nThere are also strictures some states put on voting -- most notably voter ID. There are 34 states where voters have to show some sort of photo ID in order to vote. Many Democrats complain that such laws do nothing to secure elections, which is their stated purpose, and instead are efforts to depress turnout among non-white constituencies.\n\n3. Busy, busy, busy\n\nThis is the lamest -- and, unfortunately, most common -- excuse people offer for not voting.\n\nIn 2012, 19% of registered voters who didn't voted cited being busy as their reason. Interestingly, that number dropped to 14% in 2016. Guess what soared? People saying they didn't like the candidates or the campaign issues. One in four non-voters said they just hated the two candidates in 2016.\n\nThe last presidential election aside, the \"too busy\" excuse though has almost always been right at the top of why non-voters are non-voters. And that has something to do with the fact that unlike countries who have fought for the right to vote in recent years, Americans tend to simply take it for granted.\n\nCould 2018 break this low-turnout-midterm mold? If 2016 taught me anything, it's to never say never. Early vote numbers have soared past 2014, with more than 20 million votes cast early\n\nTrump clearly believes something special is happening. Here's what he said Sunday in Georgia: \"There have never been crowds like this, just so you understand, in the history of politics. You've never had crowds like this for midterm elections. There's never been crowds like this.\"\n\nTrump broke every rule in 2016. Could he do the same in 2018 in bringing droves of voters out to the polls? And, if he does, is that actually a good thing for his party?", "Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Armed men kidnapped 79 children from a boarding school in Cameroon's Northwest region, a local government official told CNN Monday.\n\nLouis Marie Begne, spokesman for Cameroon's Northwest government, said the men entered the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, overwhelmed the guard and forced him to take them to the sleeping children.\n\nThe men took 79 boys and girls and tried to drive away with the school's minibus.

Usually, it sounds like a machine doing a pretty poor job of pretending to be a bell.\n\nLincoln, Ford's luxury division, is trying to improve on the usual warning chime by using recordings of actual musicians playing real instruments inside a music hall. This way, when you forget to put on your seat belt, you'll be reminded by a professional musician.\n\nSpecifically, Lincoln recorded three musicians from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra playing short bursts of sound. Those sounds will be used as the warning and alert tones in the new Lincoln Aviator SUV.\n\nSix different types of instrumental riffs \u2014 from friendly \"non-critical\" sounds to attention-grabbing \"hard warning\" tones \u2014 will sound for 25 different situations in the vehicle. The sounds are played by string musicians Adrienne R\u00f6nmark and Eric Nowlin and percussionist Joseph Becker who plays the marimba.\n\nTo create alert tones for the Lincoln Aviator, musicians were recorded on stage at Detroit's Orchestra Hall.\n\n\"We were able to use the musical language that we use in orchestra every day,\" said Nowlin in a video presentation. \"We have moments in a concert where the music seems like something exciting is happening or something dangerous is happening or something more mellow or welcoming is happening in the music.\"\n\nRead More", "Story highlights Every state east of the Mississippi River will see rain\n\nOver 35 million under severe storm risk from Philly to Atlanta\n\nElection Day snow for Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota\n\n(CNN) A significant storm system is taking shape over the middle of the country and it could bring nasty weather to the Northeast, Midwest and South on Election Day.\n\nAn area of low pressure moving through the Midwest into the Great Lakes could mean a stormy trek to the polls for people in states from the Great Lakes all the way to the Gulf Coast.\n\nEvery state east of the Mississippi River is likely to see rain at some point when the polls are open on Tuesday, though some states will undoubtedly see more storms and potentially disruptive weather than others.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3 of 5) for severe storms for Monday night into Tuesday morning for parts of the Mississippi River Valley, stretching from northern Louisiana to Nashville.", "(CNN) NBC and Fox News said in separate statements on Monday that their networks will no longer air the Trump campaign's racist anti-immigrant advertisement.\n\nNBC was first to announce the change, doing so after a backlash over its decision to show the 30-second spot during \"Sunday Night Football,\" one of the highest-rated programs on television.\n\n\"After further review,\" NBC said, \"we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible.\"\n\nFox soon followed suit.\n\n\"Upon further review, Fox News pulled the ad yesterday and it will not appear on either Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network,\" ad sales president Marianne Gambelli told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe ad ran about a dozen times on Fox News and Fox Business, combined, before being pulled.\n\nFacebook also came under scrutiny for letting the Trump campaign run the ad on its platform. On Monday afternoon the company said \"this ad violates Facebook's advertising policy against sensational content so we are rejecting it. While the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook, it cannot receive paid distribution.\"\n\nThe ad was released by the Trump campaign late last week. It vilified the thousands of migrants walking toward the US southern border, wrongly portraying them as invaders and criminals.

The 30-second spot was not only racist, it also contained factual inaccuracies, and it is not uncommon for networks to reject advertisements on such grounds.\n\nFox's decision was particularly surprising given the network's close proximity and friendly relationship with the White House.\n\nCritics of the network say its hosts and commentators employ some of the same racist rhetoric and scare tactics that were used in the ad.\n\n\"How does Fox News square this with offering hours of the same racial fear-mongering in primetime to promote Trump (at no cost) on a nightly basis?\" asked Jesse Lehrich, communications director for the progressive group Organizing for America and a former Hillary Clinton spokesman.\n\nOn Twitter, Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, ignored the decision by Fox to pull the ad.\n\nInstead, Parscale lambasted NBC, CNN, and Facebook and said the \"#FakeNewsMedia\" was \"trying to control what you see and how you think.\"\n\nA little while later, the president was asked about the controversy by a reporter. He said \"I don't know about it. I mean, you're telling me something I don't know about.\" He added: \"We have a lot of ads, and they certainly are effective based on the numbers we are seeing.\"\n\nWhen asked about the offensive nature of the ad, Trump said, \"Well, a lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of the times.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the matter told CNN that the advertisement was not submitted to either CBS or ABC, so those networks didn't have to decide whether to sell the airtime or not.\n\nCNN had to make the decision on Friday when the ad was submitted there.\n\nThe next day, Donald Trump Jr. complained on Twitter that CNN \"refused to run\" the advertisement.", "(CNN) President Donald Trump is closing the 2018 campaign in a familiar key: Making barely-veiled racial attacks in hopes of driving a portion of his base to vote.\n\nThree instances from the weekend stand out:\n\n1.

Bezos owns the Washington Post and is still by far the biggest shareholder in Amazon.\n\nKhashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. Saudi officials first denied all knowledge of his fate before admitting later that his killing was premeditated murder.\n\nThe Post has been demanding information about Khashoggi's death and justice for his killers. It described Saudi Arabia's version of events as a \"coverup\" last month.\n\nOn Friday, the Post published an op-ed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan where he wrote : \"The order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\"\n\nSaudis have used Twitter and local media outlets to denounce what they described as a \"media campaign\" aimed at tarnishing Saudi Arabia's image and undermining efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to modernize the country.\n\nA Saudi journalist, Bandar Otyf, tweeted to his 105,000 followers that the Post \"consistently publishes articles that are defaming.\"\n\n\"Let's defend our nation ... boycott Amazon to send a message to its owner so he is aware of the scale of the damage,\" Otyf added.\n\nAmazon doesn't have a big presence in the Middle East but the company last year bought Souq.com , the region's leading e-commerce platform based in Dubai, to extend its reach.\n\n\"Boycott Amazon and Souq.com\" was one of the top trending hashtags in Saudi Arabia on Monday. By 4:30 pm in Riyadh (8:30 am ET), it had been mentioned in over 8,000 tweets.\n\n\"It's not acceptable, the [Amazon] owner is the same owner of the paper that attacks our nation and its leaders,\" said another Twitter user.\n\nBezos has so far not spoken out about the killing, but the Post's publisher Fred Ryan has kept up the pressure on the Saudi authorities.\n\nRyan said on Thursday Khashoggi was \"lured into a death trap.\" He also announced an initiative \u2014 the Press Freedom Partnership \u2014 to \"increase awareness of the importance of an independent press.\"\n\nOne Twitter user said he was not going to join the boycott.", "Mark Hetfield is the President and CEO of HIAS, the global Jewish non-profit that protects refugees. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Hours before an American invader opened fire inside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, he published a social media post invoking the name of HIAS (once known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), the organization that I lead.\n\n\"HIAS likes to bring invaders that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics. I'm going in,\" he wrote\n\nAs the CEO of a non-profit, I can say this is never how you plan for your organization to be thrust into the national spotlight.\n\nIn the days since the tragedy, our staff and supporters have struggled to come to grips with the idea that anyone could be so incited by our work welcoming and protecting refugees that he would invade a sanctuary and take the lives of 11 worshipers.\n\nHIAS is one of the nine national agencies that partner with the United States government to resettle refugees as part of the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Founded in 1881, HIAS is the oldest global refugee agency in the world, and the only Jewish one. Since our founding, we've assisted millions of refugees. Together with our partner in Pittsburgh, Jewish Family and Community Services, and others across the country, we've directly resettled more than 450,000 refugees in the US since 1980 when the USRAP was established, according to HIAS annual reports.\n\nLike any mission-driven non-profit operating today, we are concerned about the polarization of this country. People are angry and divided on many issues -- immigration chief among them. But anger alone does not explain the increase in social spaces for demonizing and attacking marginalized populations. From the darkest corners of the internet to the highest levels of government, we have allowed fear and hate to manifest as real-world violence.\n\nWe cannot afford to let it fester any longer. We cannot wait for hate to rear its head when given the room to do so.\n\nAs a nation, we must listen to one another, address concerns with facts and reunite our fractured country so that everyone in every community feels welcome and safe. We can disagree on important issues, but we cannot tolerate intolerance or hate speech, as hateful words often lead to hateful acts. That's as much an obligation for the President of the United States as it is for you at your Thanksgiving table. Silence in the face of hate speech is no longer an option.\n\nIn the refugee protection world and beyond, an uptick in extremism and hate has been building for the past three years. Since the Paris attacks in November 2015, when 31 governors announced their intention to ban Syrians from their states, refugees have served as scapegoats for elected officials leveraging fear in exchange for political capital. It is not a coincidence that President Donald Trump's first major action after taking office was an attempt to ban mostly Muslim travelers and refugees from entering the United States.\n\nPublic officials in this country have long conflated refugees with the evil they are fleeing in order to meet political ends. In the lead-up to the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, which restricted immigration into the US, Congressman Albert Johnson published a report from the US consulate in Rotterdam arguing against admitting Polish Jews because they were \"filthy, un-American, and often dangerous in their habits.\" Immigration to the United States was severely restricted for the next 40 years.\n\nDespite shameful pauses and interruptions in the US's immigration history, the American Jewish community exists in large part due to those times when America's doors were open to refugees. And, until relatively recently, Jews comprised a significant percentage of those searching for safety.\n\nIn almost every generation, our ancestors confronted a choice: stay at home and risk everything, or risk everything and search for safety elsewhere. Like the nearly 70 million displaced people around the globe today -- the most since World War II -- they chose the latter.\n\nToday, we pay it forward by rescuing people of all faiths whose lives are in danger for being who they are, and our work remains guided by who we are. HIAS endures because the Jewish people have learned the hard way that without welcomers, there will be no welcome. We were living those values just one week before the Pittsburgh tragedy, when nearly 300 congregations in 33 states celebrated HIAS' first-ever National Refugee Shabbat , designed to demonstrate that American Jews welcome refugees, as we were once refugees ourselves.\n\nThe terrorist in Pittsburgh explicitly targeted National Refugee Shabbat participants, including Dor Hadash, which shares sacred space with the Tree of Life and New Light congregations. He thought he could stop us from being compassionate to one another. He could not have been more wrong.\n\nOut of his despicable actions, we have witnessed more support than ever for the mission of our organization -- support from Jews, but also from Muslims, Christians and people of other faiths.\n\nFor more opinion...

When we see hate speech online or hear it in person against any group: Jews, refugees, Muslims, transgender people, Latinos or African Americans, we need to say something. Everyone has a role to play in reducing the spaces for intolerance in our society.\n\nYou are either combating hate speech, or you are accepting it.

What began as an outcry against social and racial injustice turned into a political row about patriotism.\n\nUS President Donald Trump described the NFL protesters as \"sons of bitches,\" while quarterback Kaepernick is still without an NFL contract after leaving the San Francisco 49ers in March 2017.\n\nNBA legend LeBron James told CNN's Don Lemon that President Trump was \"using sports to kinda divide us ... Sports has never been something that divides people. It's always been something that brings someone together.\"\n\n\"A lot of athletes have spoken out or have made a stand, and whether it's supposed to be about politics or not it seems like it always ends up being about politics,\" added Shiffrin, who is targeting a third straight World Cup overall skiing title this season.\n\n\"And that has ruined careers, you know. Even with teammates speaking about politics and getting a ton of backlash for it, and I watch and I think, 'They stated their opinion, sorry.' But that's something I'm not prepared to deal with right now. If I'm not absolutely sure I don't want to force that on other people.\"\n\nVonn, one of the most successful ski racers of all time, faced a barrage of online abuse after voicing her views on Trump in an interview with CNN in December.\n\nIn a lengthy Instagram post afterwards she added: \"My recent comments opened up my eyes as to how divided we are right now.\n\n\"It is hurtful to read comments where people are hoping I break my neck or that God is punishing me for being 'anti-Trump.'\"\n\nU.S. Ski & Snowboard told CNN it \"fundamentally supports our athletes' first amendment right to freedom of speech.\"\n\nThe body says it supports it athletes to make sure their thoughts are \"articulated clearly and fairly,\" but added \"they are their own people and we want them to express themselves.\"\n\nMikaela Shiffrin won gold and silver in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang in February.\n\n'Freedom of speech'\n\nAs one of the world's biggest stars, Tiger Woods' views are often sought on politics, race and society, but the former world No.1 golfer is notoriously reticent to offer comment. Woods has played golf with President Trump a number of times, but whenever he is asked if that should be seen as an endorsement he offers a stock response.\n\n\"He's the President of the United States. You have to respect the office,\" Woods said in August. \"No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office.\"\n\nIf you think celebs should \"stick to _____\" and not be allowed to voice their political opinions that's fine but then don't you even think about discussing sporting events, TV shows/ movies, music, etc. because you aren't a professional athlete, actor, or recording artist... \u2014 Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) October 29, 2018\n\nAnother golfer Rory McIlroy was criticized for playing golf with President Trump in February. He said at the time it \"wasn't an endorsement nor a political statement of any kind,\" but later admitted he would \"think twice\" about doing it again given the backlash\n\nUS freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy recently questioned why athletes and celebrities received abuse for sharing their views.\n\nThe 2014 Olympic slopestyle silver medalist wrote on Twitter: \"If you think celebs should 'stick to____' and not be allowed to voice their political opinions that's fine but then don't even think about discussing sporting events, TV shows/movies, music, etc. because you aren't a professional athlete, actor, or recording artist...\"\n\nPhotos: Skiing into a new season All eyes will be on Lindsey Vonn in her final season as she strives to become the most successful ski racer ever.

I only know that what we've seen lately isn't great, so it's an awkward position to be in at 23 and feeling like, 'I'm supposed to know.'\"\n\nShiffrin says she would hate the \"pressure\" of being in political office -- \"I have enough pressure trying to win World Cup races\" -- and admits \"I don't have the answers.\"\n\n\"I believe every single one of our presidents has genuinely wanted the best and wanted to fix problems and they just have their own way of going about it and you're never going to make everyone happy,\" she says.\n\n\"No one's ever going to agree with you 100% but then there are also signs that maybe it's not right job for you.\"\n\nUltimately, Shiffrin has a simple wish: \"If everybody were to be kind to one another, have your opinions but don't force that on others as fact, trust science, that's pretty much it. I don't think it has to be that much more difficult.\"", "Los dem\u00f3cratas contin\u00faan teniendo una ventaja de dos d\u00edgitos sobre los republicanos en una votaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9rica en el Congreso entre los posibles votantes\n\nLos votantes deben decidir el martes si restringen al presidente Donald Trump y sus republicanos despu\u00e9s de los primeros dos a\u00f1os de una presidencia demag\u00f3gica que ampli\u00f3 las divisiones nacionales\n\n(CNN) - Faltando un d\u00eda para las elecciones intermedias, los estadounidenses se enfrentan a una elecci\u00f3n que podr\u00eda dar forma a la naci\u00f3n durante a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de una campa\u00f1a que la dej\u00f3 destrozada pol\u00edticamente, en guerra consigo misma por la raza, y de luto por la tragedia.\n\n\n\nMIRA: Encuesta CNN: En la v\u00edspera de las elecciones intermedias en EE.UU., los dem\u00f3cratas mantienen la ventaja\n\nLos votantes deben decidir el martes si restringen al presidente Donald Trump y sus republicanos despu\u00e9s de los primeros dos a\u00f1os de una presidencia demag\u00f3gica que ampli\u00f3 las divisiones nacionales y se desarroll\u00f3 en un torrente de esc\u00e1ndalos. Trump tambi\u00e9n puso a prueba las normas constitucionales y dise\u00f1\u00f3 un cambio brusco en la actitud del pa\u00eds hacia el resto del mundo.\n\nLos dem\u00f3cratas contin\u00faan teniendo una ventaja de dos d\u00edgitos sobre los republicanos en una votaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9rica en el Congreso entre los posibles votantes, de acuerdo con una nueva encuesta de CNN realizada por SSRS. La ventaja de 55% a 42% del partido en la nueva encuesta refleja su liderazgo a principios de octubre y es casi igual a la ventaja de 10 puntos que tuvieron justo despu\u00e9s del D\u00eda del Trabajo.\n\nPero al enfrentarse a su primera oportunidad de juzgar el desempe\u00f1o de Trump, tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edan registrar su satisfacci\u00f3n con una econom\u00eda hist\u00f3ricamente exitosa y un presidente que ha cumplido muchas de sus promesas electorales, sin importar qu\u00e9 tan controversiales, y tiene una administraci\u00f3n innegablemente importante que ha logrado dise\u00f1ar una cambio conservador generacional en la Corte Suprema.\n\nEl primer resultado representar\u00eda una reprimenda para todo el enfoque pol\u00edtico de Trump: su incapacidad para dominar sus instintos vol\u00e1tiles en el mejor inter\u00e9s de la unidad nacional y su falta de voluntad para abrazar a la propia presidencia como una confianza nacional.\n\nEl segundo escenario transmitir\u00eda la aquiescencia por las t\u00e1cticas extremas del presidente, su infatigable y dominante personalidad, las advertencias que hacen temer a la naci\u00f3n de que la naci\u00f3n est\u00e1 siendo atacada por una marea de invasores inmigrantes de criminales de piel oscura y la aprobaci\u00f3n de su credo del nacionalismo de Estados Unidos primero.\n\n\"Vieron que sub\u00eda ese alambre de p\u00faas. Ese alambre de p\u00faas. S\u00ed, se\u00f1or. Tenemos alambres de p\u00faas subiendo. \u00bfPorque saben qu\u00e9? No estamos dejando que estas personas invadan nuestro pa\u00eds\", dijo Trump en un mitin en Georgia el domingo, defendiendo su decisi\u00f3n de enviar tropas a la frontera en lo que los cr\u00edticos han calificado de \"truco\" pol\u00edtico.\n\nMIRA: Recta final de las elecciones intermedias: las posibilidades\n\nSi bien la campa\u00f1a ha visto intensas escaramuzas sobre la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica, la inmigraci\u00f3n, la educaci\u00f3n y la mejor manera de compartir los dividendos del alto crecimiento, el bajo desempleo y el aumento de los salarios, Trump, como lo hace todo el tiempo sobre todo lo dem\u00e1s, hizo la campa\u00f1a sobre s\u00ed mismo.\n\nEn el argumento de cierre m\u00e1s inflamatorio de cualquier campa\u00f1a en la memoria moderna, Trump aprovech\u00f3 a un grupo de migrantes que se dirig\u00edan hacia la frontera sur de EE.UU. desde Centroam\u00e9rica como una met\u00e1fora de su ret\u00f3rica de la l\u00ednea dura y de insultos raciales sobre la inmigraci\u00f3n. Su ret\u00f3rica nacionalista provoc\u00f3 cr\u00edticas de que hab\u00eda cruzado una peligrosa l\u00ednea luego de que un hombre armado mat\u00f3 a 11 personas en una masacre de la sinagoga en Pittsburgh y un partidario de Trump envi\u00f3 bombas a los principales objetivos del presidente en pol\u00edtica y medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, incluidos dos expresidentes.\n\nPero es una medida del clima pol\u00edtico vol\u00e1til del pa\u00eds, y las lecciones de la victoria desafiante de la l\u00f3gica de Trump en 2016, que nadie pueda decir con seguridad c\u00f3mo se desarrollar\u00e1 el martes por la noche.", "\u0623\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629

announced it would raise rates by an average of 4.9% as of January 7, 2019. That matches the increase that FedEx put in place at the start of 2018.\n\nFedEx rival UPS has yet to announce its rate increase for 2019. But the US Postal Service has proposed increasing its rates for Priority Mail boxes by an average of 5.9%. The Postal Service wants the rate hikes to take effect in January, but the government hasn't yet ruled on the proposal.\n\nCosts are rising because of higher fuel prices. FedEx reported that in the quarter ending in August, its fuel costs were 40% higher than a year earlier, and labor costs were up 11%. The increased price of jet fuel alone increased its costs by more than $200 million in the quarter.\n\nBut FedEx has been able to capture some of those increased fuel costs through a separate fuel surcharge it has in place for some shippers.\n\nRead More", "\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0637\u060c \u0641\u0647\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0641\u0634\u063a\u0641\u060c \u0641\u0645\u0647\u0646\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635.. \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u0629 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0637\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0645\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645. \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u060c \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0636\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u061f\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u060c 05 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.", "(CNN) Rihanna is the latest artist unhappy over the fact their music is being co-opted by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe singer responded Sunday after Philip Rucker, the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post, tweeted that Rihanna's single \"Don't Stop the Music\" was being played at a Trump rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\n\"Not for much longer...me nor my people would ever be at or around one of those tragic rallies, so thanks for the heads up philip!,\" Rihanna tweeted.\n\nNot for much longer...me nor my people would ever be at or around one of those tragic rallies, so thanks for the heads up philip! https://t.co/dRgRi06GrJ \u2014 Rihanna (@rihanna) November 5, 2018\n\nThe tweet came hours after Rihanna, who is a native of Barbados, endorsed Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum.\n\nFLORIDA: You have the opportunity to make history this election.

than women from melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer, a new global analysis said.\n\nOver the last three decades, male deaths from melanoma were higher than female deaths in 33 countries, according to the analysis presented Sunday at the 2018 NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow. Rates among women have either stabilized or decreased.\n\nThe study focused on 33 developed countries in Europe, North America and Australasia, as they had the most reliable data.\n\nThe researchers \"wanted to conduct an up-to-date analysis of recent melanoma mortality rates across the world to try to understand these patterns, and whether new diagnosis, treatment and prevention strategies are having any effect,\" said Dr. Dorothy Yang, a junior doctor at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, who led the research.\n\n\n\n\"Over the past 30 years mortality trends (for melanoma) have increased in most countries,\" Yang told CNN. \"There is evidence that suggests men are less likely to protect themselves from the sun or engage with melanoma awareness and prevention campaigns.\"\n\nShe added that female and male biological differences are currently being studied to find out if these also contribute to the gender disparity in deaths from melanoma and stressed this is an observational study and that more research is needed into why there are gender differences in the mortality rates.\n\nMelanoma has the highest mortality rate of skin cancers, according to the paper, and accounted for 1.7% of all cancer diagnoses worldwide this year. Yang's team analyzed World Health Organization data on mortality rates from melanoma between 1985 and 2015 and identified a rise in male deaths from melanoma in 32 out of the 33 countries included in the analysis. The researchers took aging or younger populations in each country into account for their analysis.\n\nRise in 32 countries\n\nAustralia and Slovenia were found to have the highest number of melanoma deaths across both sexes for the time period 2013 to 2015. In Australia, 5.72 male deaths were reported for every 100,000 men, compared to 2.53 female deaths per every 100,000 women. Rates among men in Slovenia were 3.86 per 100,000.\n\nOther countries, like Slovakia and Croatia, also experienced a large number of male deaths from melanoma during this period.\n\nThe UK was in the middle, with 2.57 men dying per 100,000 compared to 1.58 among women. The US did not have data for this time period.\n\nJapan saw the lowest increase of melanoma deaths for the three-year period, with 0.24 men in every 100,000 dying and 0.18 out of 100,000 women.\n\nThe only country which reported a decrease in male deaths of melanoma was Czech Republic. There, a 0.7% annual decrease was found between 1985 to 2015.\n\nIsrael and Czech Republic were the best performing countries when it came to reduction of female mortality rates, with Israel reporting a 23.4% drop and Czech Republic reporting a 15.5% decrease of female deaths due to the skin cancer.\n\nPortugal saw the largest growth of male mortality rates due to melanoma from 1985 to 2015, with a 192.4% increase, followed by Greece and Ireland, which saw rises of 121% and 115.5%, respectively.\n\nFor female melanoma deaths during the same time period, Portugal also lead with an increase of 160.7%, followed by Greece, where female deaths rose by 130.6% and Spain, where female deaths increased by 73.6%.\n\nExposure to UV radiation\n\nThe largest risk factor for melanoma is overexposure to ultraviolet radiation, from sun exposure or using sunbeds, explained Yang.\n\nDespite public health efforts to increase people's awareness of these risk factors, Yang mentioned there has been an increase of melanoma cases over the past decades, particularly in regions with fair-skinned populations.\n\nEarlier this year, scientists in Australia developed an experimental blood test that could detect melanoma with an 84% accuracy.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that 5,990 US men and 3,330 US women will die from the skin cancer in 2018.\n\n\"We know that nine in 10 people diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer in the UK survive their disease for at least 10 years,\" Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head information nurse, said in an email to CNN. \"A growing and aging population means that more people are being diagnosed with the disease than ever before.\"\n\nLedwick added that while this study shows death rates for men have increased, more investigation is needed to find out why. \"Once we know the answer, researchers may recommend targeting men with information about how to reduce their risk of skin cancer such as advice on staying safe in the sun and getting any new moles or blemishes -- or changes to existing ones -- checked out by a doctor.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"This research shows that death rates for melanoma are stabilizing or decreasing in some countries, particularly for women,\" Poulam Patel, chair of the NCRI Skin Cancer Clinical Studies group and professor of clinical oncology at the University of Nottingham, said in an email to CNN. Patel, who was not involved with the research, added that the findings require further scrutiny.\n\n\"These results also suggest that melanoma will continue to be a health issue over the coming years, and we will need to find effective strategies to accurately diagnose and successfully treat patients,\" Patel said.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN)\u2014 \u064a\u0646\u0635\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u062d\u062b\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0648\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644\u060c \u0644\u062a\u0643\u0648\u064a\u0646 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0642\u062f \u062a\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0635\u0642\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0628\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u062e\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0634\u0649 \u0645\u0639 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0637\u0644\u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0642. \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u064a\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0643\u0645 \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 CNN \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0639 \u0628\u064a\u062a.\u0643\u0648\u0645.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u060c 05 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa medida apunta a las industrias de petr\u00f3leo y gas, construcci\u00f3n naval, transporte y banca de Ir\u00e1n\n\nTeher\u00e1n dijo que desafiar\u00eda las sanciones econ\u00f3micas que le impuso EE.UU. y que entraron en efecto\n\n(CNN) - El presidente de Ir\u00e1n Hassan Rouhani prometi\u00f3 desafiar las sanciones de Estados Unidos, mientras las sanciones contra las industrias de petr\u00f3leo y gas del pa\u00eds entraron en efecto este lunes.\n\nLa ronda de sanciones m\u00e1s mordaces desde que el presidente Donald Trump se retir\u00f3 del hist\u00f3rico acuerdo acuerdo nuclear de 2015 para restringir el programa nuclear de Ir\u00e1n, entr\u00f3 en efecto este lunes.

A series of email chains obtained by CNN late Sunday indicate that, rather than taking part in any alleged \"hack,\" the Georgia Democrats had simply passed along information about security concerns from a voter to a private cybersecurity firm, which in turn shared the issue with Kemp's office.\n\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a statement Monday that its Georgia Cyber Crime Center had opened a criminal investigation at the request of Kemp's office.\n\nAs secretary of state, Kemp is overseeing an election in which he is also running, and he has resisted calls to step aside to avoid potential conflicts of interest.\n\n\"It's wrong to call it an investigation,\" Abrams told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day.\" \"It's a witch hunt that was created by someone who is abusing his power.\"\n\nRead More", "Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army officer, is director of Doctors Under Fire, a campaign against attacks on hospitals in war zones.

The UN's inspectors, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), have been called on to investigate some of these attacks, but the Russians have obstructed their ability to do so.\n\nBut despite Russia's best efforts to stall and to clean up the Douma site, the OPCW has been able to confirm that it was a chemical attack.\n\nI have investigated many attacks in Syria as part of my work with the CBRN Task Force, which treats casualties and collects evidence in crisis areas.\n\nIn April 2014, I published the results of our investigation into the attacks on Kafr Zita and Talemenes in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.

This low-level use of chemical weapons is probably something that NATO -- or the US -- had never envisaged. Now, we need to find a way to combat it.\n\nJUST WATCHED UK police confirm nerve agent used in poisoning Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH UK police confirm nerve agent used in poisoning 01:38\n\nWe know that the deadly nerve agent Novichok was used in the attack on Salisbury. And we know that the Russian suspects were Russian military intelligence officers and they bought the Novichok from Russia with two days before the attack. Russia has continued to deny any involvement.\n\nNovichok was developed in the 1970s and '80s at the central Russian military establishment at Shikhany.\n\nIt is thought to be 10 times more toxic than VX -- the nerve agent used in the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's brother Kim Jong-nam -- and is very persistent.\n\nSome contaminated buildings in Salisbury may need to be taken down brick by brick and buried deep elsewhere to get rid of the danger. Probably less than half an egg cup of agent transfixed the world for months and greatly increased the tensions between the West and Russia. And it won't have gone unnoticed by terrorists and lone wolves.\n\nHad the recent pipe bombs sent to opponents of President Trump contained some form of chemical agent, large sections of Manhattan could still be in lockdown.\n\nAnother mega city, Sydney, Australia, very nearly saw a chemical attack last year when UK and Australian Security Services interdicted jihadists trying to use hydrogen sulphide as a weapon on crowds and jet aircraft.\n\nAl Qaeda's former chemical weapons expert -- and since MI6 agent Aimen Dean -- has just released his brilliant autobiography \"Nine Lives.\" He told me recently that the Sydney device was derived from work he did in the 1990s in Afghanistan.\n\nMost NATO countries have paid little more than lip service to the chemical threat since the end of the Cold War, because they believed it had disappeared. This has no doubt changed since the Salisbury attack.\n\nThe attack in the UK confirmed suspicions that Russia had only destroyed its declared chemical weapon stockpile by 2017, but not its undeclared stockpile of Novichok.\n\nIt is not likely that Russia has thousands of tons of the stuff. But the fact it has this deadly weapon of mass distruction is of great concern to the US and NATO. Especially so, as Novichoks appear to overmatch some NATO chemical defensive capabilities.\n\nIn the new Cold War with Russia, the US must be prepared for the use of chemical weapons.\n\nEveryone has seen their effects in Syria and Iraq. If there is conflict between East and West, we must now assume that chemical weapons will be used.\n\nThis, coupled with the very real threat of terrorist use -- anywhere, anytime -- means the US will need to reinvest in its chemical defense capabilities and be prepared to fight in this \"dirty\" environment.\n\nThe Salisbury attack has been a massive neon advertisement to terror groups for the effectiveness of very small amounts of chemical agents in cities. We must ensure that we are up to this emerging challenge to protect the likes of New York, LA and Orlando.\n\nLike any threat: if we prepare to counter it, we will prevail; if we stick our heads in the sand, we will be bitten.", "Dan Crenshaw, the Republican congressional candidate whose eye was destroyed while he served in Afghanistan, responds to \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian Pete Davidson's jokes at his expense.", "(CNN) People will need to take greater responsibility for their own health -- staying active, quitting smoking and limiting alcohol, sugar and fat -- to protect their health, the UK's Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday as part of the government's \"new 21st century focus on prevention.\"\n\nThe guidance comes as part of a new long-term vision for the UK's National Health Service (NHS), \" Prevention is better than cure, \" which will make prevention programs an integral part of the National Health Service, building on the success seen in areas such as child obesity and smoking cessation.\n\n\"It's about people choosing to look after themselves better,\" said Hancock. \"It's the difference between spending the last 20 years of your life fit and active, or in constant pain from a chronic condition.\"\n\nThe strategy will shift focus away form treatment to preventive measures delivered through primary and community care and follows on from Prime Minister Theresa May's mission announced earlier this year to ensure people can enjoy at least five extra healthy years of life by 2035.\n\n\"Prevention is also about ensuring people take greater responsibility for managing their own health,\" said Hancock in a speech at the International Association of National Public Health Institutes meeting in London.

deal as the Trump administration added nearly 700 targets, including 50 Iranian financial institutions, to a sanctions list Monday.\n\nTrump administration officials said the reinstated sanctions marked an intensifying effort to strangle Iran's economy to pressure the regime to change its ways. Any company or country that does business with Tehran will feel the sting of US penalties, they said.\n\nThe campaign, a central foreign policy goal for President Donald Trump, marks a gamble as it divides the US from traditional allies in Europe, casts uncertainty into oil markets, is likely to deepen humanitarian suffering inside Iran and, critics say, potentially undercut moderates in Tehran who might be open to working with the US.\n\n'Laser focus'\n\n\"We are making it abundantly clear to the Iranian regime that they will face mounting financial isolation until they fundamentally change their destabilizing behavior,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday in Washington, adding the regime must its stop ballistic missiles program and abandon its nuclear ambitions if wants to seek a path to sanctions relief.\n\nThe deal, one of the President Barack Obama's signature foreign policy achievements, has been vilified by Trump since his early campaign days.\n\n\"We are watching the Iranian regime with laser focus,\" Mnuchin told reporters. \"If they try to evade our sanctions, we will take action to disrupt their activity time and time again. The maximum pressure exerted by the United States is only going to mount from here.\"\n\nIn a sweeping list, the Treasury Department labeled an additional 700 entities, including individuals, banks, vessels, aircraft and Iran's energy sector as part of its decision to reapply harsh sanctions that kicked in early Monday morning. The reinstated sanctions follow the Trump administration's decision in May to pull out of the international nuclear deal that is still supported by all other parties, including the EU, France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China.\n\nThe EU, UK, France and Germany said on Friday said they \"deeply regret\" the US move. China on Monday said it \"regrets\" the US decision, adding that the global community \"generally opposes the practice of unilateral sanctions and long arm jurisdiction.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said that eight countries would get waivers that would allow them to continue importing Iranian oil: China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey.\n\nEach of these countries \"has already demonstrated significant reductions of Iranian crude,\" Pompeo added. He said two of those eight \"have completely ended imports of Iranian crude\" and the US will continue negotiations to \"get the rest to zero.\"\n\nThese waivers were granted \"to ensure a well-supplied oil market,\" Pompeo said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Anger sets in as Iran braces for US sanctions Replay More Videos ...

However, fears of a supply shortage have been eased by the Trump administration's temporary waivers for China and India and stronger oil output from Saudi Arabia and the United States.\n\nUS oil prices, which have also been hurt by worries about slowing global growth, have declined by about 17% since peaking on October 3.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed to continue oil exports Monday, saying Iran will \"proudly break the unjust sanctions.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson confirmed that the US will also grant a waiver to Iraq to continue purchasing Iranian electricity.\n\n\"A waiver was granted to allow Iraq to continue to pay for electricity imports from Iran,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are confident this will help Iraq limit electricity shortages in the South. We continue to discuss our Iran-related sanctions with our partners in Iraq.\"\n\nIn a move that will ratchet up pressure on Iran, SWIFT, the messaging service used by global banks, said it would suspend some of the country's banks. Mnuchin had said Friday that if the global service did not cut off designated institutions, it could be subject to sanctions.\n\n\"In keeping with our mission of supporting the resilience and integrity of the global financial system as a global and neutral service provider, SWIFT is suspending certain Iranian banks' access to the messaging system,\" SWIFT said in a statement. \"This step, while regrettable, has been taken in the interest of the stability and integrity of the wider global financial system. Our mission remains to be a global neutral messaging provider.\"\n\nThe US announcement on Monday brings the total of Iranian-related targets sanctioned under the Trump administration to 900 in less than two years and represents a significant escalation of Washington's efforts to place economic pressure on the Iranian regime.\n\n'Starve the regime'\n\nThe goal, Pompeo said Monday, is to \"starve the regime\" and force it to \"abandon its current revolutionary course.\" That includes Iran's detention of Americans, its support for Hezbollah, Houthi rebels in Yemen, its involvement in Iraq and Syria, among other activities Pompeo said are destabilizing the Middle East.\n\nLast week, Pompeo said the US wants \"to restore democracy\" in Iran. On Monday, the top US diplomat said that Iran \"can either do a 180 degree turn from its outlaw course of action, or it can see its economy crumble.\"\n\nWe are intent on making sure the Iranian regime stops siphoning its hard currency reserves into corrupt investments and the hands of terrorists,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nThe Cabinet officials' announcement deepens a growing divide with Europe.\n\nThe EU, along with the UK, France, Germany, said Friday that the pact \"is a key element of the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture and of multilateral diplomacy, endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council.\"\n\nThey added that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the deal is formally known, \"is working and delivering on its goal\" and \"is crucial for the security of Europe, the region, and the entire world.\"\n\n'Bullying is backfiring'\n\nIran's foreign minister said Monday that the US was defying the Security Council by re-imposing sanctions, adding that the US \"bullying is backfiring.\"\n\n\"Today, US defied UN top court & Security Council by reimposing sanctions on Iran that target ordinary people,\" Foreign Minister Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"But US bullying is backfiring, not just because JCPOA is important, but because the world can't allow Trump & Co. to destroy global order.

Those firms include Bank Melli, Arian Bank, Future Bank and the Export Development Bank of Iran.\n\nSome of the banks designated on Monday have served as \"financial conduits\" for the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics and the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, according to the US government.\n\n\"This action is aimed at cutting off Iranian banks that facilitate Iran's domestic repression and foreign adventurism from the international financial system, and will highlight for the world the true nature of the regime's abuse of its domestic banking system,\" Sigal Mandelker, Treasury's counter-terrorism chief, said in a statement.\n\nThe Trump administration also designated more than 200 persons and vessels in Iran's shipping and energy sectors, including the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, which is a maritime carrier, and oil transport giant National Iranian Tanker Company.\n\n\"They're the strongest sanctions we've ever imposed,\" said Trump en route to a rally in Georgia on Sunday evening, hours before the sanctions on Iran's energy, shipbuilding and banking sectors kicked in at midnight. \"We'll see what happens with Iran,\" adding \"they're not doing very well.\"", "New York (CNN Business) US investors think way too highly of America.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\nAs the traveling press secretary twice for President Obama's presidential campaigns, as one of the spokespeople for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee when we won back the House in 2006, as a junior press staffer on John Kerry's losing presidential bid, and in Iowa during the successful re-elections of both former Governor Vilsack and former Senator Harkin in 2002.\n\nI always thought I knew what victory, and loss, felt like.\n\nWhen you win, it is a feeling of elation, often followed by extreme fatigue. When you lose, it is disappointment and second-guessing, followed by extreme fatigue. I am far from the first person to say that 2016 was different. I wasn't a part of the campaign, but I was in the White House working for President Obama as his communications director. The aftermath of the election was of course shock, but not just because of the fact that President-elect Donald Trump and not President-elect Hilary Clinton was coming to the White House the following day. It was a shock because of what it said about the country we lived in.\n\nYes, we had missed something, along with nearly every other political prognosticator on both sides of the aisle, about the anger and dissatisfaction of large swaths of white America who had long voted for Democrats. Yes, Russia had intervened, and the dire impact of the propaganda campaign run effectively online by the Kremlin was still unknown, and its full extent still even is today. And yes, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.\n\nBut it was supposed to be a shellacking, a win strong enough to carry the Electoral College. In part, our confidence stemmed from an assumption that the fight against racism, misogyny and bigotry would win out. That as a country we had made tremendous progress. That we had, all together as Americans, \"bent the moral arc toward justice.\" That even if Donald Trump was a more effective campaigner than his opponent, there was no way the country could vote for him. And we were dead wrong.\n\nThe next day in the White House was not filled with strategy sessions about how we would preserve President Obama's record. It was filled with hugs, and private and group conversations trying to reassure members of our White House staff, including many who were African-American, Latino American, Muslim-American and LGBT, that it was going to be okay. That they would be okay and the country would be okay.\n\nNow we are two years into this horrific experiment of having a racist and sexist failed businessman with no interest or appetite for strategic global engagement as our commander in chief. And it turns out we aren't okay.\n\nOur worst fears we talked about in the West Wing on that November morning were not so far-fetched. The candidate who called for the \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,\" has gone on to put into law a partial Muslim ban, preventing nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States, and gone unchecked by Republicans in the House and Senate.\n\nThe candidate who already had a long history of racist remarks and actions -- from reportedly saying, according to a former employee , that \"laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe it\" back in the 1990's, to calling people who have come from Mexico \"rapists\" shortly after he kicked off his campaign -- has supported his administration's decision to separate children from their parents at the border, paving the way for kids to live in tent cities for months without knowing where their parents are and when they may be reunited.\n\nThe candidate who said \"you have to treat 'em like s***\" in reference to women in a New York Magazine profile, and joked about grabbing women in their genitalia shortly before he ran for President, has gone on to campaign for an accused pedophile running for Senate, defended a senior staffer accused of domestic abuse, and stood by a Supreme Court nominee even after he was accused of sexual assault.\n\nEvery midterm election is a referendum on the President, and especially the first one. This year there is no question Democratic enthusiasm is way up, and there is actual evidence of this given the defeat of Roy Moore in Alabama and the victory of Governor Ralph Northam in Virginia.\n\nPotential trouble signs for President Trump's re-election campaign in 2020 are a low approval rating that may also have a low ceiling, and the fact that his campaign itself may be under investigation -- but right now, Tuesday will determine what the next few years look like. Right now, Tuesday scares me. This is the first nationwide test of who we are as a country since his election.\n\nRegardless of the cowardice of many elected members of the President's own party, will the American people stand up and reject hate and sexism? What if there is a silent mass of people in suburbs and swing districts who are embarrassed to admit they are voting for Trumplite members of the House and Senate?\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThis is a test of many unknowns, including whether young people will turn out in droves for the first time in a midterm election, whether the #metoo movement will help turn the disgust about Donald Trump's decades-old depiction of women into action, whether the fundraising advantages will lead to advantages in tough-to-win districts.\n\nFrom this midterm election standpoint, I would rather be a Democrat than a Republican in this environment, but I am far more nervous than I was on election eve in 2006. Because if Democrats, independents and some Republicans who want a check on the President don't turn out, the outcome will be far worse than 2016.\n\nPresident Trump will be running for re-election with an empowered base and a new line of bragging to take out to the campaign trail. The lesson will be that cracking down on immigration, fanning violence against the media and your opponents, and overtly racist campaign attacks and ads are not just fair game, but effective. That's not who America has ever been, but we shouldn't underestimate the potential for the President to do anything possible to gain re-election.", "Tess Taylor is the author of the poetry collections \"Work & Days\" and \"The Forage House.\" The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Heads up, Republicans: I have an announcement. I just made some of the biggest political donations of my life. I made them to your opponents. I made them to candidates I might not even have followed years ago, senators and governors in other states. I live in California, in an area where I mostly agree with what my representatives are doing. To canvass in other districts where I support opposition candidates, I'd have to drive about two hours. Since I'm a working mom and I keep long hours, sometimes I just don't have the time to spare.\n\nTess Taylor\n\nNevertheless, I think about each of you often \u2014 and not in the way you'd like. Mitch McConnell, Devin Nunes, Susan Collins, Brian Kemp: A couple of years ago I might not have even known who you were, or cared. Now, your party -- from Donald Trump to Lindsey Graham to Dean Heller -- is giving me hives. I want you gone.\n\nAnd that is why I spent the year saving all the money I could to get you out of the way. First of all, I've got to say: I don't have a lot of money. I am, for heaven's sake, a poet. I am also busy raising two kids in what is among the world's most expensive metropolitan regions. And in other years, I might have chosen to tune you out, not to care about how you affect my life or the lives of others. But I am furious at you, and I'm willing to scrimp a little so I can try to oust you, one by one.\n\nIn our house this means we are basically not buying any new stuff until Donald Trump is no longer president. This sounds drastic, but indeed, it's actually been sort of fun. We've been doing it for nearly two years now, and it's begun to feel like a comfortable new normal.\n\nNow, I am going to be honest: In two years, we slipped up a couple of times. A piece of my luggage was stolen and I had to replace my blazer and trusty pencil skirt. We bought a heat lamp for the backyard, which I am so grateful for. I did just buy the kids new Halloween costumes rather than scour used stores for the ones they wanted. And: I did consign old clothes and allow myself to shop at consignment stores for free or very low-budget purchases, which was actually a fun way to let off steam.\n\nRead More", "Karachi, Pakistan (CNN) A Pakistani Christian woman whose death sentence for blasphemy charges was commuted last week is trapped in a prison that has been converted into a safe house, a source with direct knowledge of the facility told CNN on Monday.\n\nAsia Bibi, a mother of five from Punjab province, is unable to leave the facility over fears that her life is in jeopardy, the source added.\n\nIn newly released details, CNN has learned that the Pakistani army and intelligence services have jurisdiction over the jail and are in charge of her safety, the source said.\n\nExtra surveillance cameras have been installed at the converted jail in recent days and any individuals entering or leaving the location are searched, including those who are charged with preparing Bibi's food, according to the police source.\n\nSupporters of Tehreek-e-Labbaik chant slogans Wednesday during a protest against the acquittal of Asia Bibi in Lahore.\n\nBibi's lawyer Saiful Malook, who has fled Pakistan to the Netherlands, told reporters in The Hague on Monday that the UN and EU made him leave \"against his wishes.\"\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) In another sign of the times for retail, Lowe's is closing 47 North American stores.\n\nLowe's said Monday that those locations are underperforming and the decision will help the hardware chain focus on its most profitable stores.\n\n\"The store closures are a necessary step in our strategic reassessment as we focus on building a stronger business,\" said CEO Marvin Ellison, in a statement.\n\nRetail stores are struggling to adjust to the rapid rise of online shopping, particularly from Amazon ( AMZN ).

Brady the winner in quarterback duel\n\nTwo of the best NFL players of all time went head-to-head Sunday as Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, quarterbacks sharing five MVPs between them, faced each other for only the second time.\n\nIt was 41-year-old Brady who celebrated victory in Massachusetts as the New England Patriots beat the Green Bay packers 31-17, improving its record to 7-2 to top AFC East. But it was thanks largely to the Patriots' team effort, rather than a starring role from its quarterback.\n\nStats-wise, there wasn't much between the NFL greats. Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and 259 yards, while Brady threw for just one and picked up 294 yards. Neither threw an interception.\n\nBrady, however, did put his name in the history books once again, surpassing a record held by Peyton Manning, in becoming the first NFL player to amass more than 80,000 total yards in his career.\n\n2.

Indeed, he is only the second man to rise from outside the world's top 20 to world No.1 in the same year.\n\nDjokovic beat Roger Federer in an epic three-set semifinal in the French capital Saturday, which the Serb has described as \"one of the best\" matches between the pair.\n\nJUST WATCHED Khachanov dominates in Paris Replay More Videos ...

She did, but she went too far. She should have walked away earlier. The umpire maybe should not have pushed her there. It's unfortunate, but an incredible case study.\"\n\n3.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\nFor anyone who has reached for the Lunesta in the anxious run up to November 6, it's a question that hangs with almost unbearable gravity. Will young people overcome their (alleged) disaffection to exercise the most essential American privilege? Will they put their broad minds and shoulders to the wheel? Will they please please save us from the Apocalypse? As a sleepless citizen, I've had lots of time to worry about this. And, with the last of my optimism, to count on them. But, then, I cannot actually imagine sitting the election out. Because I'm a voting freak.\n\nMy first time in a voting booth, I was 6 years old.\n\nAt our town hall, I fiddled around by the front door while my mother exchanged pleasantries with Mrs. Hurlbut, the town clerk. It was 1972 and only about 1,200 people lived in Roxbury, Connecticut. One booth -- part pinball machine, part shower stall -- waited for customers across the small room. While my mother signed in, I wandered away to look out the window. When I turned around, she was gone. Catching sight of her familiar ankles beneath the closed curtains of the machine, I scurried past Mrs. Hurlbut and through the flaps. With my mother's free hand in mine, I watched while she worked the mysterious contraption.\n\nTwelve years later, I came home from college to cast my first vote for president. Mrs. Hurlbut remained functioning beneath a corona of white hair, but the machine that year was broken. On a paper ballot, I filled in the bubble beside the names of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro, and walked out puffed with pride at my role as a grown-up American citizen, pride that survived their defeat.\n\nFully engaged in politics\n\nBy 1988, I'd become a fully engaged political animal. Fresh from graduation and living in New York, I volunteered for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' primary campaign. Then I stayed on through the general election. The experience was exhausting and exhilarating. I loved being part of something important, though I was often stunned by the trust invested in me.\n\nIn Ohio, I was a surrogate scheduler, planning stops for VIPs who came to campaign for the candidate. One day, for a heart-stopping hour, I lost the president of the Boston Bricklayers Union. While the field operator seethed at a packed VFW hall outside Columbus, I sweated it out, a phone on each ear, before hearing from the designated driver, a kid no older than me. He and Mr. McIntyre had gotten lost and were taking a break at a diner. I could have offered them my head. On a platter.\n\nI was young, and in the Iran Contra '80s, aggrieved by both the system and the old folks who created it. But instead of skepticism, I coursed with idealism, and an almost stupid sense of commitment. In the months when Dukakis was running ahead of George H.W. Bush, I thrived on junk food and adrenaline-charged optimism. As the polls tightened, I fretted and doubled down on my duties. And when things looked dire, I carried on, a soldier devoted to the mission and the man.\n\nBy Election Day, the outcome of the race was painfully obvious. New York would go blue, as usual, but in most of the country the tide had turned definitively red. I woke on November 8 and headed up to East Harlem to knock on doors. After that, I planned to go to Boston to be present for the inevitable concession cry-fest.\n\nBut in between I had to vote.\n\n'I was a professional!'\n\nIt was around 3 in the afternoon when I made it to my polling place. During the last hours of campaigning, a co-worker had slapped a Dukakis bumper sticker on the back of my sweatshirt. As I ran up the stairs inside PS 87, I suddenly remembered the sticker was there and stopped to peel it off. I didn't want to be accused of electioneering. I didn't want anything to disqualify me from casting my second, and personally most significant, presidential vote. The disappointment I felt about my candidate's impending loss was riding a totally different track than the zeal I had for the democratic process. A familiar spark of civic spirit fired in my chest.\n\nInside the gym, I found a scene nothing like I knew from Roxbury. So many tables! So many machines! Not wanting to appear untutored, I pulled out my voting card and puzzled my way to the appropriate table. Two women -- pleasant, indifferent -- matched my name on the card to the one in the polling book. I work for one of the candidates, I wanted to say, signing my name with a flourish. I wasn't just some amateur off the street. I was a professional!\n\nBut still, I'd never actually operated a voting machine. Stepping between the curtains, I eyed the red handle. A couple summers earlier, my friend Laura and I had taken a trip out West. Somewhere in Nevada we passed an evening at a run-down casino drinking free liquor and feeding quarters to the slot machines. Inside the voting booth, I grabbed the handle and worked it like a one-armed bandit. With a pull to the right, the curtain closed around me. Pulling left, the space opened up again. As soon as I'd done it, I knew it was a mistake. When I tried to move the levers to vote for individual candidates, they wouldn't turn.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said approaching the ladies at the table. \"I pulled the lever thingie but I haven't voted yet.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" one of the them replied, dry as toast.\n\n\"I pulled the curtain closed but then I pulled it open again before I voted. I need to do it again.\"\n\n\"You can't,\" she said.\n\nTrying to contain my alarm, I asked for clarification.\n\n\"You're done,\" she answered flatly. \"You can't vote again.\"\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nEven now, I don't fully understand my behavior that afternoon. One of the most common tropes about millennial nonvoters is a sense of deficiency. They don't think their votes matter, so they don't vote. Here I was backing a candidate certain to win by a healthy margin in my state, and just as certain to lose nationwide. My vote literally did not matter. Which did not slow me down a whit. If I were hitching a ride out of Zombieland, I could not have been more panicked or adamant.\n\n\"I have to vote,\" I told the ladies.\n\n\"You have. You're done,\" they insisted.\n\nWhere was Mrs. Hurlbut?\n\nPoll workers from other precincts were drawn over by the debate, but each concurred with the existing verdict. I'd pulled the handle back. My vote, empty as it was, had been cast. I couldn't vote again. Where was Mrs. Hurlbut when I needed her? Finally, one kindly worker, moved by my mania, left to consult with a supervisor. Returning, she handed me a piece of paper with a number.\n\n\"Call the Board of Elections,\" she said, looking warmly into my eyes.\n\nFollowing her directions, I raced upstairs to a pay phone. Not surprisingly on Election Day, the number was busy. For 15 minutes I fed my quarter into the phone and fruitlessly pressed the same buttons. The clock was ticking on my Boston trip. It was time to consider another plan. I left PS 87 and ran the four blocks to my apartment. At home I had a phone with a long cord and a redial button. By the time I got through to the Board of Elections, I'd packed my bag and was positioned by the door.\n\n\"Yes, Miss, I understand,\" said the woman on the other end of the receiver, \"but the only thing you can do is go before a judge.\"\n\nWhere, I wanted to know, was that judge? Moments later, I was on the 1 train to 200 Varick Street and the headquarters of the New York County Board of Elections. Even I thought I was bananas. But like the train itself, once I'd set the thing in motion it was just too late to stop.\n\nMy motives that day were fairly simple, and not particularly patriotic. By my lights, it seemed fraudulent to have spent so much time exhorting people to vote and then not managing to vote myself. What sort of pinhead doesn't know how to operate a voting machine? What would I tell my parents? What would I tell my friends? But under the thicket of guilt and self-recrimination, I'd glimpsed something of true adulthood. It wasn't a game played for quarters. And you didn't walk away when the trend was not in your favor. The aim was to be counted, for oneself. But the meaning and the deeper pleasure came from being counted on, by others.\n\nAt Varick Street, I raised my right hand and stepped to the bench. As I told my story to the elderly judge, he shook his head and a smile slowly creased his face. When I busted back into PS 87 with my overnight bag in one hand and the judge's decision in the other, the poll workers applauded.\n\nI cast my vote and headed north, my freak flag flying high.",

Brooks Koepka at the top of the world rankings.\n\nLi led by three shots heading into the final day in Antalya, but Rose fired a final-round 68 to force a sudden-death playoff after the pair tied at 17 under.\n\nIt was Li who cracked under the pressure, three-putting from just nine feet to gift Rose the title.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

pioneers, whose faces and works have been largely absent from its museums.\n\n\"The history of photography has been written, in general, by men,\" said Fannie Escoulen, the curator who has organized this parcours as part of the annual Paris Photo exhibition, the largest international art fair dedicated to photography, which begins in the French capital on November 8. Her project, named \" Elles x Paris Photo ,\" is taking visitors to discover the women who have picked up a camera -- likely numbering as many as men, according to Escoulen -- but many galleries have left out of the picture.\n\n\"Persimmon, The unknown\" (2018) by Andrea Torres Balaguer. Credit: Andrea Torres Balaguer, Courtesy in camera galerie\n\nIn a phone interview, Escoulen explained the walk will not take the form of a lecture, rather a journey of discovery: \"It's not an exhibition. it's a provocation,\" she said. \"I don't know exactly why women, little by little, disappeared.\"\n\nThe tour takes visitors through the glass-vaulted halls of the Grand Palais, Paris Photo's central hub on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and through a cross-section of the city's art institutions. Stops along the way include the main venue's historic sister gallery, the Petit Palais, photographic specialists such as Photo Saint Germain and Jeu de Paume, and the Fondation Cartier, the fashion house's imposing collection. Each will show works by women photographers, who, curators said, deserve to be rediscovered or better known by the public.\n\nThe secret world of Ellen von Unwerth\n\nFollowing a chronological path, the project showcases works from photographic pioneers of the early 20th century, such as Scottish-Canadian Margaret Watkins, one of the first women commercial photographers, and Lucia Moholy, the Czech wife of Bauhaus artist Laszlo Moholy Nagy, whose remarkable architectural and personal photography is often cast in the shadow of her husband's fame. Visitors will move through the radical feminists of the 1960s to 1980s -- including Japanese experimental photographer Kunie Sugiura and Jan Groover, whose still life shots influenced a generation that includes Wolfgang Tillmans -- and on to under-recognized contemporary artists.\n\nThe female pioneers of photography\n\n\"Last VIII\" (2009) by Agn\u00e8s Geoffray. Credit: Courtesy of Galerie Mauber\n\nAll around the world, largely self-motivated female photographers have built their practice, side-by-side with male counterparts, almost since Louis Daguerre created the first commercially viable photographic process in Paris, in 1839, explained Escoulen.\n\n\"Photography was a medium that was very simple and very accessible to anyone who wanted to explore it,\" she said. \"Women photographers were probably many when the medium was created -- then they had to deal with being a professional photographer.\"\n\n\"Before long travel, August 23\" (1972) by Rachel Monosov and Admire Kamudzengerere. Credit: Rachel Monosov and Admire Kamudzengerere, Courtesy Catinca Tabacaru Gallery\n\nEven in the medium's early days (when clunky cameras and volatile film stocks required optical and chemical expertise), practical complexities paled in comparison to the hurdles of social expectation, with the requirement to raise families preventing most female photographers from maintaining careers.\n\nDespite social barriers, many persisted, with Watkins spending the 1920s photographing pioneering advertising images of domestic scenes for Macy's department stores, and later traveling to document the early Soviet Union.\n\nChen Man: 'Tech and art must go together'\n\nWhile most roles as war or documentary photographers were taken by men, Escoulen identifies global similarities among early 20th century female pioneers, who often worked in isolation. Countless photographs depict interests that appear surprisingly contemporary -- intimacy, domesticity, tenderness and self-representation -- all of which would later begin to characterize a generation of 21st century photographic artists.\n\n\"Fish on the Plate\" (1935) by Marta Aczel. Credit: Estate of the artist, courtesy of Vintage Gal\u00e9ria Budapest\n\nEscoulen said male acclaim was self-reinforcing throughout photography's early days, with men in prominent positions in magazines and museums supporting other men to launch exhibitions and validate their work.\n\nMeanwhile, many talented women fell by the wayside, unheralded by institutions or, for myriad reasons, giving up the camera. Despite earning early exhibitions in the US, Watkins skirted the limelight and spent much of her life caring for elderly aunts in Edinburgh. By the time she died in 1969, she was a virtual unknown and it would be decades before her negatives were rediscovered and museums began celebrating her work.\n\nBut, by the 1960s and 1970s, feminist movements across the arts explicitly challenged masculine norms. American photographer Joan Lyons, who will discuss her work at Paris Photo on Nov. 8, produced introspective images of her own experience that fought back prevailing beliefs that photos should be universal and objective. Instead, she used Polaroid, Xerox machines and other alternative methods of image making to create personal images that were inseparable from her experience.\n\n\"Presences 1\" (1980) by Joan Lyons. Credit: Joan Lyons, Courtesy Steven Kasher Gallery\n\nEscoulen said that despite huge changes and tools like Instagram allowing anyone to self-publish photos, there remains worldwide institutional resistance to women succeeding in photography.\n\n\"I would say most of them suffer a lack of visibility,\" she said.\n\nWhile the erasure of female photographers is a global problem, to Escoulen some countries have been slower to tackle galleries' biases and to give a platform to female photographers.\n\nIn Paris, some galleries, such as Jeu de Paume, consciously maintain a gender parity in their exhibition programming. But they are honorable exceptions. Escoulen described one friend, the photographer Lise Sarfati, who left the French capital for the U.S., where, she felt, \"the question of being a woman or man is not there.\"\n\n\"I think the problem is not only in Paris,\" Escoulen said. \"It is in France but also in Spain and probably in Italy. They are also south (European) countries, so maybe still more misogene (sexist) maybe more machiste (chauvinist).\"", "\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0642\u0644\u0645

But if Democrats fail to turn the House blue, the strategy will largely be viewed as a failure, proving that Democrats still have not figured out how to message around Trump two years after his election.\n\n\"It is not a deliberate strategy to ignore President Trump, it just is,\" said Chrissy Houlahan, a first-time candidate and veteran running in a district that snakes through the Philadelphia suburbs into more rural Pennsylvania as she knocked on doors Sunday. \"It is just not worth the air or the airtime that we give him.\"\n\nHoulahan was not once asked about Trump during her hour-long canvas shift in Coatesville, an economically depressed town on the outer reaches of Philadelphia's so-called collar counties. Instead, voters peppered her with questions about education, housing policy and strategies to make the town safer.\n\n\"Frankly,\" said Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton as he campaigned for Democrats across the Mid-Atlantic, \"the President deserves to be ignored.\"\n\n\"I take my cues from what the voters are talking to me about and the voters here are talking about health care,\" said Andy Kim, the Democratic candidate running in New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District. \"I would say the voters are not taking the bait, they are not getting distracted from the issues they care about.\"\n\nKim's race against Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur is ground zero for the health care and tax debate, and seen nationally as a test case for whether the two issues were as potent as Democrats believed this year. MacArthur authored a key amendment to the health care repeal bill and is the only New Jersey Republican to back the tax plan, a vote that angered New Jersey voters because it outlawed their ability to write off their high property taxes.\n\nThose votes did not go unnoticed in the district and have put MacArthur, a congressman who won 60% of the vote in 2016, in jeopardy of losing his re-election bid.\n\n\"It was disqualifying,\" Lisa Cenneno, a 48-year old independent who voted for MacArthur two years ago, said of the Republican's vote on health care. \"He says that he cares about his constituents. I don't find that he does because he is not willing to listen to all of us, he only wants to listen to those constituents that are giving him money.\"\n\nMacArthur declined repeated interview requests for this story.\n\nIt has been clear throughout the closing months of the campaign, though, that Trump is aware health care is a top issue for voters. In speeches and on Twitter over the last month, he has slammed Democratic support for universal health care and looked to blunt attacks on Republican efforts to roll back protections on pre-existing conditions with a series of obviously false or wildly misleading remarks.\n\nTrump spent the weekend stumping for candidates in West Virginia, Indiana, Montana, Georgia and Tennessee, delivering a bellicose message on immigration and lamenting how it's not \"as exciting\" to discuss booming economic numbers.\n\nThe President has used his rallies to stoke fear of migrants, regularly using misleading or outright false information to do so.\n\n\"These are rough, rough people in many cases,\" Trump said of migrants moving through Mexico during a Saturday speech in Georgia. Earlier in the week, he lamented the fact that it's not \"as exciting\" to discuss booming economic numbers.\n\nThe strategy for Trump is a pure base play: He and his advisers in the White House believe if they can engage the same voters that vaulted Trump to the White House two years ago, they can buck history in the midterms.\n\n\"I think we're going to do well in the House, but as you know my primary focus has been on the Senate,\" Trump said. \"And I think we're doing really well in the Senate.\"\n\nSome Republicans are skeptical and wish the President would spend more time talking about the economy, an issue that is more resonant with suburban voters who will likely decide the midterms in key House races. But those prospects, along with oft-touted promises by Republicans to make tax reform central to 2018 campaigns, have gone out the window, helped by the fact that Trump admitted earlier pledges to pass a second tax reform bill in 2018 were largely bluster.\n\nTrump is \"bringing up all of these buzzwords that stir up a frenzy in the base,\" said Kim Schrier, a Democrat running in Washington State's 8th Congressional District. But, she added, \"We all teach our kids that we're better than this and that kind of rhetoric is unacceptable. And I'm hoping it brings a lot of people out too, saying, 'No. We don't tolerate this divisiveness and whipping up a frenzy.'\"\n\nWhile Democrats on the ballot have avoided Trump, national figures in the Democratic Party -- namely former President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden -- have laid into the President on the campaign trail.\n\n\"They promised they were going to take on corruption in Washington,\" Obama said in Indiana on Sunday . \"Instead they've racked up enough indictments to field a football team. Nobody in my administration got indicted.\"\n\nBiden told voters in Pennsylvania on Sunday that Tuesday's election was an effort to \"reset the moral compass of this nation,\" charging that Trump \"puts fuel on the fire of intolerance and legitimates people who should never be heard.\"\n\nBut what has surprised some party operatives is the way in which Democrats, from moderates running in districts Trump carried by double digits in 2016 to more progressive candidates in safe Democratic seats, have found success in not talking that much about the President.\n\nIn upstate New York, Anthony Brindisi is defying political gravity and giving Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney a close race in a district the President won by 16 points. And he's doing it by ignoring Trump, a direct contrast to Tenney's tactics.\n\n\"This race is going to hinge on myself and Claudia Tenney because at the end of the day, we are the names on the ballot,\" Brindisi said. \"People are looking for someone who can unite people (now) and she has made a career out of trying to divide people.\"\n\nBrindisi's pitch mostly focuses on his local roots, promises to improve access to education and opposing efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He stops short of outright support for Medicare for All.\n\nDownstate, the more progressive Liuba Grechen Shirley, a first-time candidate running against Republican Rep. Peter King in Long Island and supporter of Medicare for all, agreed with Brindisi when it came to Trump and his efforts to scramble the debate.\n\n\"It's easy (to focus mostly on health care),\" she said. \"We've been having roundtables and town halls and meet-and-greets around the district and we focus on different topics, but every single one somehow turns into a conversation about health care. It is always the first thing people talk about when I'm out knocking on doors: Health care and then taxes.\"\n\nThis strategy has been reflected in Democratic spending, too. Over the course of 2018, Democratic campaigns have run an astonishing $331 million in ads on health care, according to data from CMAG, making the issue 53% of all ads run on television by the party's candidates this year.\n\nAnti-Trump messaging comes in at eighth on the list, with only 11% of Democratic ads channeling antipathy, at least directly, toward the President.\n\nThe candidates have made Trump a focus in their campaign are typically those running against Republicans who have tried to distance themselves from him. In the Philadelphia suburbs, Democrat Scott Wallace, who says he decided to run for office for the first time because of Trump and the tax vote, is quick to make mention of the leader of Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick's party.\n\nWallace, while knocking on doors on Sunday, regularly told voters that Tuesday's election was the \"first chance for us to say something about what is going on in Washington\" and the best chance to \"send a message to\" the capitol.\n\nThe logic behind his focus on national politics, Wallace said, is Fitzpatrick. The Republican has tried to distance himself from the GOP, even telling his Democratic opponent during a debate to \"keep party labels out of\" the contest. What had Wallace done? Only noted that Fitzpatrick was, in fact, a Republican.\n\n\"It's a moderate district. He is trying to please the centrist moderates and he is trying to please the Trump people, too,\" Wallace told CNN on Sunday. \"To me it is like trying to straddle a fence, one foot on one side of the fence and one on the other. And from a guy point of view, that is a good way to hurt yourself.\"", "All 435 House races are on the ballot, with Democrats feeling optimistic about winning control of the chamber.\n\nIn the Senate, 35 seats are at stake, with Republicans positioned to hold -- and possibly expand -- the party's slim majority.\n\nAnd 36 gubernatorial contests will be decided, with Democrats looking to put a dent in the current 17-seat advantage for Republicans.\n\nThat doesn't count the 6,066 state legislative races across 46 states and 158 ballot measures in 37 states.\n\nWith so much at stake, we here at CNN have identified 10 races that help explain the story of the 2018 midterms -- and might offer hints about how things are likely to shake out on Election Night.\n\nKentucky's 6th District: The Early Indicator\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate Amy McGrath\n\nThis Lexington-area district will be one of the first places we see votes on Election Night and could offer an early clue at just how energized Democrats are this year. Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, has given GOP Rep. Andy Barr a run for his money in a district President Donald Trump carried by 16 points. If Democrats are winning in places like eastern Kentucky, then Republicans could be in for a long night on Tuesday.\n\nVirginia's 7th District: Tea Party vs. The Resistance\n\nAbigail Spanberger, Democratic U.S. Representative candidate from Virginia\n\nTwo-term Rep. Dave Brat stunned the political world in 2014 when he defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a GOP primary. Four years later, Brat could find himself on the losing end of another upset, facing a strong challenge from Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer. She is not running as a progressive firebrand, but just as Brat rode the Tea Party wave against Cantor, Spanberger could capitalize on the suburban backlash to the President in a traditionally Republican district.\n\nNew Jersey's 7th District: The Trump Drag\n\nRep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J.,\n\nCan a moderate Republican survive in a swing district where disapproval with the President is creating significant headwinds? That is the question confronting several GOP incumbents, including New Jersey Rep. Leonard Lance. The five-term incumbent broke with his party and voted against the Republican tax bill and the GOP's 2017 effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Despite those moves, Lance might not be able to escape the shadow cast by Trump and the GOP agenda. He faces a well-funded challenge from Democrat Tom Malinowski, a former State Department official, in a district Hillary Clinton carried by a single point.\n\nCalifornia's 45th District: Welcome to the O.C.\n\nRep. Mimi Walters, R-Calif.\n\nThere are seven GOP-held seats in California that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. They include the 45th District which is based entirely in Orange County and is a longtime Republican stronghold that's become increasingly diverse. Mitt Romney won the district by 12 points, but it went for Clinton by five. GOP Rep. Mimi Walters is running against Democrat Katie Porter, a consumer protection lawyer and Elizabeth Warren prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. A victory here by Porter, a progressive favorite who has endorsed single-payer health care, would send a signal of how far the politics of this area have moved.\n\nIowa's 3rd District: Obama-Trump Turf\n\nCindy Axne, democratic candidate for the U.S. House in Iowa's 3rd district\n\nThere's been a lot of attention paid to the 25 GOP seats Clinton carried in 2016 -- and rightfully so -- but Democrats are also on offense in many of the dozen districts that swung from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump four years later. Iowa's 3rd District is a prime example. Obama twice won this southwestern Iowa district, home to the capital city of Des Moines, on his way to capturing the Hawkeye State during both of his presidential runs. Trump carried the district by three points as part of his nine-point victory in the state. Do voters in Iowa and other spots on the Obama-Trump map swing back to the Democrats? This contest features a matchup between two-term GOP Rep. David Young and Democrat Cindy Axne, a small business owner and first-time candidate.\n\nTexas' 7th District: The Swanky Suburbs\n\nRep. John Culberson, R-Texas\n\nFor Democrats, gaining the 23 seats needed to win control of the House will likely mean flipping several upscale suburban districts with large numbers of college graduates. Texas' 7th District, home to the west Houston suburbs, fits that mold. This once solid Republican seat sent George H.W. Bush to Congress in 1966. But the changing demographics of the district -- which became majority-minority after redistricting in 2011 -- have turned it into one of the most competitive House races in the Lone Star State. Trump lost the district by a single point to Clinton, 48% to 47%, after Romney carried the district 60% to 39% four years earlier. Nearly $18 million has been spent on TV ads in the race between nine-term GOP Rep. John Culberson and Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, an attorney.\n\nGeorgia's 6th District: The Wave Maker\n\nLucy McBath, the Democratic candidate in Georgia's 6th District.\n\nFor decades, Georgia's 6th District has been solid Republican turf -- electing Newt Gingrich and Tom Price to Congress -- and voting for GOP presidential candidates such as Romney and John McCain by wide margins. Then Trump entered the picture. In 2016, Trump won the suburban Atlanta district by a single point. GOP Rep. Karen Handel scored a four-point victory in a fiercely-contested 2017 special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff. Now she faces a challenge from gun control activist Lucy McBath , whose son was shot and killed in 2012 after a dispute over loud music. If Democrats are winning districts like this one in Georgia, then the party should be in the majority come January with some room to spare.\n\nMissouri Senate: A Red State Toss-Up\n\nThe Senate story this cycle has centered on the favorable map for Republicans with 10 Democratic incumbents running in states Trump won in 2016 -- five of them by double digits. Democrats hold a very narrow path to the majority -- one that almost certainly closes if Sen. Claire McCaskill is unable to hold on in Missouri. The two-term Democrat won her first race in 2006, a strong year for the party, and benefitted from a weak opponent in 2012. Polls in the Show Me State show the race is deadlocked. If McCaskill is able to defeat Republican Josh Hawley, the state's attorney general, that would be a positive sign for other Red State Democrats such as Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Jon Tester in Montana and Joe Manchin in West Virginia.\n\nNevada Senate: A Test of the Health Care Argument\n\nHealth care has been the dominant message for Democrats this cycle -- mentioned in more than half the party's TV ads. In Nevada, Democrats have made every effort to ensure voters in the Silver State remember GOP Sen. Dean Heller's shifting stances on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Heller initially opposed GOP proposals to dismantle Obamacare, only to vote in favor of the so-called \"skinny repeal\" measure that failed in the Senate. The campaign of Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen has run TV ads featuring a clip of the President pressing Heller on health care to suggest the senator bowed to political pressure when he voted for the GOP plan. A recent CNN poll found health care was the top issue for 28% of likely voters in Nevada, followed closely by immigration at 26%. But it was the number one issue for 49% of likely Democratic voters. For Democrats such as Rosen who are in razor-thin races, the potency of the health care argument could be crucial to their chances.\n\nFlorida Governor: The 2020 Teaser\n\nThe race for governor in the Sunshine State is one of the marquee races of the cycle. In the short-term, it's a battle of political bases with progressive Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, facing off against former Rep. Ron DeSantis, who won the GOP primary by aligning himself closely with President Trump. That's reason enough to keep a close eye on this race. But there are massive implications for 2020, with Democrats in the midst of a debate between the progressive and moderate wings of the party. A Gillum victory in the biggest presidential battleground prize would give the progressive wing an added jolt as the early 2020 jockeying begins in earnest.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - Una pareja de reci\u00e9n casados falleci\u00f3 el domingo despu\u00e9s de que el helic\u00f3ptero que los transportaba desde su boda se estrell\u00f3 en Uvalde, Texas.\n\nWill Byler y Bailee Ackerman Byler eran estudiantes de \u00faltimo a\u00f1o en la Universidad Estatal Sam Houston y la noticia de su muerte fue primero reportada por el diario estudiantil independiente de la instituci\u00f3n, The Houstonian.\n\n\"Es con profunda tristeza que informamos del tr\u00e1gico fallecimiento de dos Bearkats, Will Byler (estudiante de \u00faltimo a\u00f1o de Ingenier\u00eda Agr\u00edcola) y Bailee Ackerman Byler (estudiante de \u00faltimo a\u00f1o de Comunicaci\u00f3n Agr\u00edcola) en un accidente de helic\u00f3ptero al marcharse de su boda.

On Friday, the Supreme Court allowed it to move forward, and as a result, it is scheduled to begin before U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman in Manhattan federal court.\n\nThe plaintiffs, which are led by the New York attorney general's office, argue that Ross's reason for adding the question, which hasn't been asked of all census recipients since 1950, was to dissuade immigrants from participating. Because census figures are used to allocate congressional seats and determine federal funding for certain government programs, undercounting of immigrant populations could negatively impact their representation.\n\nLast March, when Ross announced the reinstatement of the question, which asks respondents whether they are US citizens, he said the Justice Department had requested the change in part because the information would be useful for the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Ross said at the time that the question could affect response rates.\n\nThe Supreme Court had previously barred the plaintiffs from taking Ross's deposition, but said the deposition of other officials can take place.", "WASHINGTON (CNN) On the eve of the midterm elections , Democrats continue to hold a double-digit lead over Republicans in a generic congressional ballot among likely voters, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS . The party's 55% to 42% advantage in the new poll mirrors their lead in early October and is about the same as the 10-point edge they held just after Labor Day.\n\nThat's a slimmer edge than the party held in CNN's final poll before the 2006 midterm elections and similar to the Republicans' 10-point advantage just before the 2010 midterms.\n\nDemocrats benefit from a massive gender gap that has persisted throughout the fall (women favor Democrats 62% to 35%, while men are about evenly divided, 49% back the Republican, while 48% support the Democrat in their district), a wide lead among political independents (53% for the Democrat to 39% for the Republican), and strong support from black and Latino voters (88% of black voters and 66% of Latino voters favor the Democrats).\n\nThe gender gap cuts across lines of race and education, with non-white women (79% favor Democrats) and white women with college degrees (68% back the Democrat) breaking most heavily for the Democrats, while white men (57% Republican) and particularly white men without college degrees (65% back the Republican) are most deeply behind the GOP.\n\nAbout 7 in 10 likely voters say that when they cast a ballot on Tuesday, they'll be sending a message about President Donald Trump, and more often than not, the message those voters want to send is one of opposition.\n\nOverall, 42% of likely voters say their vote will be to express opposition to the president, while 28% say that it'll be to support him.\n\nAnother 28% say their vote isn't about the president. That level of opposition is similar to the way likely voters felt just ahead of the 2006 election, when 41% said they were voting to oppose then-President George W. Bush. Fewer voters in that year, just 16%, said they were turning out to support the president.\n\nTrump's approval rating in the poll stands at 39% overall, with 55% disapproving, slightly worse than in early October, when 41% approved of his performance and 52% disapproved.\n\nThat is the worst pre-election approval rating for any president approaching their first midterm election in polling dating back to Eisenhower.\n\nAmong likely voters, a majority, 52% say they strongly disapprove of the way the president is handling his job, 35% say they strongly approve of his work as President, and just 11% of those likely to vote on Tuesday say they don't have strong views on Trump.\n\nWith the election just days away as the poll was conducted, enthusiasm was up among both parties' voters, but Democrats advantage in enthusiasm narrowed to just 4 points: 68% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were enthusiastic about voting, while 64% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the same.\n\nA majority of likely voters (52%) say they consider health care extremely important to their vote for Congress on Tuesday, with immigration and Trump closely behind at 49% each. Just behind that, 47% each say the economy, corruption and gun policy are extremely important to their vote.\n\nBut voters' issue priorities are sharply divided by party. Among Democrats, 71% call health care extremely important. That stands at 37% among Republicans. Almost two-thirds of Republicans (64%) say immigration is extremely important to them, while that dips twenty points to 44% among Democrats. And while 60% of Republicans call the economy extremely important, just 39% of Democrats agree.\n\nMost Democrats consider the Russia investigation a critical part of their vote (53% say it's extremely important), but just 8% of Republicans say the same. The one issue they both agree on: Trump. Majorities in both parties say he's extremely important to their vote (55% of Republicans, 53% of Democrats).\n\nAbout half of likely voters say that if Democrats win control of Congress, the country would be better off (48%), while about a third say it'll be worse off (35%).\n\nMost Americans (56%) think it's likely that a foreign government will interfere with the US elections this fall, and 74% think that if it happens, it would be a crisis or a major problem. Worries about foreign interference are more widespread among Democrats, 74% of whom think it's likely to happen and 90% of whom consider it a major problem.\n\nAmong Republicans, just 33% think such interference is likely and 57% consider it a major problem or more.\n\nThe poll also finds 8 in 10 Americans think the country is more deeply divided this year on major issues than it has been in the past several years. That's slightly lower than the 85% who felt that way just after Trump's election in 2016.\n\nAs many as 74% say that the recent tone of American politics is encouraging violence among some people. That's about the same as said so in a CBS News poll conducted shortly after a Republican member of Congress was shot during a June 2017 congressional baseball practice for a charity event.\n\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from November 1 through 3 among a random national sample of 1,518 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, for the subset of 1,151 likely voters, it is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.", "If your day doesn't start until you've gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Midterm elections\n\n23 & 2: That's what Dems need to flip Congress\n\n23 & 2: That's what Dems need to flip Congress 01:28\n\n23 & 2: That's what Dems need to flip Congress\n\nWe have reached the final days of a midterm election cycle unlike any other. President Trump is burning up the campaign trail , with five rallies in two days where he's talking in apocalyptic terms about immigration (and occasionally mentioning the booming economy). The Democrats, led by big rallies with former President Obama, hope the unprecedented level of early voting this cycle means they've juiced turnout enough among their supporters that they can retake the House and grab back some power in Washington. The stakes couldn't be higher : voters will either choose to constrain Trump and his unconventional presidency, over concerns about his behavior and many scandals, or they will reward him for overseeing a historically red-hot economy and keeping his election promises, however controversial.

That means it didn't explode in the air. They also confirmed that the pilots reported issues flying the plane on another route a day before the crash. On a flight from Bali to Jakarta, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 had a big drop in altitude. \"After 10 minutes in the air, the plane dropped as if it was losing power,\" a passenger on that flight said. \"People panicked.

The new statement, which updates a policy the group put out 20 years ago, describes how several studies have found associations between spanking and aggressive child behavior as well as adolescent depression.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nSelfie fail\n\nOoops!

Shewry is the brainchild behind \"Attica,\" which came in at No. 20 in the World's 50 Best Restaurant list in 2018.\n\nThe black ant dessert at the Lexus Design Pavilion. It's made by New Zealand chef, Ben Shewry -- who's the brainchild behind Attica.\n\nShewry uses the crushed black ants to create a new-twist on Australia's beloved lamington -- traditionally a plain sponge cake with chocolate coatings and coconut sprinkles.\n\nIn the kiwi's version, he serves up an ice-cream lamington as dessert, which is coated in black Australian ants and coconut with chocolate grown and hand made in Queensland's Daintree Forest.\n\nThe Lexus Marquee features ornate table settings, a garden oasis and a Mecca beauty lounge.\n\nThe dish will be served up in Lexus Design Pavilion's \"Utopia\" -- which is making history this year as the largest dining space ever at the Birdcage enclosure.\n\nInside, it features ornate table settings, a garden oasis, a powder room and touch-up Mecca beauty lounge and of course -- one of Lexus' concept vehicles, the LF-1 Limitless.\n\nOnly the best for attendees, some of whom have paid $2,200 for access to the exclusive area.\n\nLexus' marquee will showcase its LF-1 Limitless concept car. It's designed to be powered by gas, hybrid or full-electric.\n\nOut-of-this-world champagne\n\nAlso featured in the enclosure is the \"Space Odyssey\" themed marquee by French champagne house, Maison Mumm.\n\nThe marquee is centered around its Mumm Grand Cordon Stellar -- which it says is the first champagne bottle designed for space travel so that it can be consumed by astronauts and travelers.\n\nMaison Mumm's birdcage marquee is centered around the celebration of its recent launch of Mumm Grand Cordon Stellar -- the first champange bottle designed for spcae travel.\n\nIn a statement, the champagne house said: \"With space travel set to become the next frontier of luxury tourism, Mumm Grand Cordon Stellar will be the drink of choice for those daring enough to explore this innovative new territory.\"\n\nThe high-tech bottle uses the champagne's gas to release the liquid into the air in an effervescent ball of foam. Maison Mumm says once the champagne enters the mouth, the foam transforms into liquid.\n\nMaison Mumm has created champagne that can be consumed in zero-gravity.\n\n\"It's a very surprising feeling,\" Mumm's Cellar Master, Dider Mariotti said in a statement.\n\n\"Because of zero gravity, the liquid instantly coats the entire inside of the mouth, magnifying the taste sensations. There's less fizziness and more roundness and generosity, enabling the wine to express itself fully.\"\n\nAs only 30 bottles were made during production, A-listers unfortunately only have a chance to look but not taste the champagne -- which has been shipped to Melbourne from Paris.\n\nBut instead, guests can enjoy an elaborately decorated marquee which features a 12-meter rocket, an orchestra and various space-themed foods.\n\nWeek-long extravaganza\n\nExtravagance is synonymous with the turf race -- which is among the richest horse races in the world. The $7.3 million race began in 1861 and has evolved into a week-long festival -- where horse racing isn't its only focus, but also fashion, entertainment and hospitality.\n\nDuring the week, the Melbourne Cup's Carnival features four days of thoroughbred racing, which includes the Derby Day, Melbourne Cup Day, Oaks Day and Stakes Day.\n\nFans cheer on the horses during Melbourne Cup Day at Flemington Racecourse in 2017.\n\nThe winner of the \"race that stops the nation\" on November 6,will receive $4 million, plus $250,000 in trophies.\n\nThis year's favorite to win the Melbourne Cup is Irish trainer Aiden O'Brien's four-year-old, Yucatan.", "(CNN) Recovering the wreckage of a helicopter that crashed, killing a newlywed couple and their pilot Saturday, \"is going to be difficult\" because of the rough Texas terrain, authorities said.\n\nThe two were married just before the fatal crash.\n\nWill Byler and Bailee Ackerman Byler, who married Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch in Uvalde, had just exchanged vows and were en route to their honeymoon about 100 miles east in San Antonio when their helicopter crashed into a mountain, game warden Rachel Kellner of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said.\n\nThey were seniors at Sam Houston State University.\n\nAlso killed was the pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, the groom's grandfather, William Byler, told CNN affiliate KTRK\n\nThe pilot was \"highly qualified,\" with 24,000 hours of flying, said Craig Hatch, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating.

Authorities were notified just after midnight Saturday, she said.\n\nRescue crews set off at daybreak Sunday and crossed four ranches to get there, Gazaway said.\n\nUniversity reacts to the students'

It allows doctors to prescribe medication to their patients' partners without examining them. The idea is to prevent the kind of reinfections described by Bowe -- and stop the transmission of STDs to others.\n\nHowever, many physicians aren't taking the federal government's advice because of entrenched ethical and legal concerns.\n\n\"Health care providers have a long tradition of being hesitant to prescribe to people they haven't seen,\" said Edward Hook, professor at the University of Alabama's medical school in Birmingham. \"There is a certain skepticism.\"\n\nA nationwide surge of sexually transmitted diseases in recent years, however, has created a sense of urgency for doctors to embrace the practice. STD rates have hit an all-time high , according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. In 2017, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased nearly 19 percent from a year earlier to 555,608. The rate of chlamydia cases rose almost 7 percent to 1.7 million.\n\n\"STDs are everywhere,\" said Dr. Cornelius Jamison, a lecturer at the University of Michigan Medical School. \"We have to figure out how to ... prevent the spread of these infections. And it's necessary to be able to treat multiple people at once.\"\n\nmajority of states allow expedited partner therapy. Two states -- South Carolina and Kentucky -- prohibit it, and six others plus Puerto Rico lack clear guidance for physicians.\n\n2014 study showed that patients were as much as 29 percent less likely to be re-infected when their physicians prescribed medication to their partners. The study also showed that partners who got those prescriptions were more likely to take the drugs than ones who were simply referred to a doctor.\n\nYet only about half of providers reported ever having prescribed drugs to the partners of patients with chlamydia, and only 10 percent said they always did so, according to a different study . Chlamydia rates were higher in states with no law explicitly allowing partner prescriptions, research published earlier this year showed.\n\nBecause of increasing antibiotic resistance to gonorrhea, the CDC no longer recommends oral antibiotics alone for the infection. But if patients' partners can't go in for the recommended treatment, which includes an injection, the CDC said that oral antibiotics by themselves are better than no treatment at all.\n\n\"Increasing resistance plus increasing disease rates is a recipe for disaster,\" said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors . The partner treatment is important for \"combatting the rising rates of gonorrhea in the U.S. before it's too late.\"\n\nThe CDC recommendations are primarily for heterosexual partners because there is less data on the effectiveness of partner treatment in men who sleep with men, and because of concern about HIV risk.\n\nBowe said that even though she writes STD prescriptions for her patients' partners, she still worries about doing it because of possible drug allergies or side effects.\n\n\"I don't know their medical conditions,\" she said. \"I may contribute to a problem down the road that I'm going to be held liable for.\"\n\nIn many cases, doctors and patients simply do not know about partner therapy. Ulysses Rico, who lives in Coachella, Calif., said he contracted gonorrhea several years ago and was treated by his doctor. He didn't know at the time that he could have requested medicine for his girlfriend. She was reluctant to go to her doctor and instead got the required antibiotics through a friend who worked at a hospital.\n\n\"It would have been so much easier to handle the situation for both of us at the [same] moment,\" Rico said.\n\nSeveral medical associations support partner treatment. But they acknowledge the ethical issues , saying it should be used only if the partners are unable or unwilling to come in for care.\n\nFederal officials are trying to raise awareness of the practice by training doctors and other medical professionals, said Laura Bachmann, chief medical officer of the CDC's office of STD prevention. The agency posts a map with details about the practice in each state.\n\nOver the past several years, advocates have won battles state-by-state to get partner treatment approved, but implementation is challenging and varies widely, said Harvey, whose National Coalition of STD Directors is a member organization that works to eliminate sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThe fact that some states don't allow it, or haven't set clear guidelines for physicians, also creates confusion -- and disparities across state lines.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood affiliate that serves both Indiana and Kentucky sees this firsthand, said clinical services director Emilie Theis. In Indiana, providers can legally write prescriptions for their patients' partners, but they are prohibited from doing so in Kentucky, even though the clinics are only a short drive apart, she noted. A similar dynamic is at play along the South Carolina-North Carolina border, where Bowe practices.\n\nCalifornia started allowing partner treatment for chlamydia in 2001 and for gonorrhea in 2007. The state gives medication to certain safety-net clinics, a program it expanded three years ago. However, \"it has been an incredibly difficult sell\" because many medical providers think \"it's a little bit outside of the traditional practice of medicine,\" said Heidi Bauer, chief of the STD control branch of California's public health department.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAt APLA Health, which runs several health clinics in the Los Angeles area, nurse practitioner Karla Taborga occasionally gives antibiotics to patients for their partners. But she tries to get the partners into the clinic first, because she worries they might also be at risk for other sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\"If we are just treating for chlamydia, we could be missing gonorrhea, syphilis or, God forbid, HIV,\" Taborga said. But if prescribing the drugs without seeing the patients is the only way to treat them, she said, \"it's better than nothing.\"\n\nEdith Torres, a Los Angeles resident, said she pressured her then-husband to go to the doctor after he gave her chlamydia several years ago: She refused to have sex with him until he did. Torres said she wanted him to hear directly from the doctor about the risks of STDs and how they are transmitted.\n\nIf he had taken the medication without a doctor visit, he wouldn't have learned those things, she said. \"I was scared and I didn't want to get it again.\"", "02:33\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \"\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0645\u0627

crashed into the sea, killing 189 passengers last month, was found to have a malfunctioning air speed indicator for its last four flights -- and, crucially, at the time of the crash, according to the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee.\n\nInvestigators who analyzed the flight data recorder after the October 29 crash uncovered the fault, the committee said. The finding is the first technical problem revealed as part of the investigation into why the plane crashed.\n\n\"We are formulating, with NTSB and Boeing, detailed inspections regarding the airspeed indicator,\" according to Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of the committee.\n\n\"We found a malfunction in an air speed indicator instrument in the last four flights, including the crash flight,\" Capt. Nurcahyo Utomo of the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) told CNN on Monday. \"We ask NTSB and Boeing to work on this to prevent same accident happening in the future.\"\n\nUtomo confirmed to CNN that there were two airspeed indicators in the cockpit. \"One belongs to the pilot in command and one belongs to the co-pilot. One of them should have reacted to the airspeed indicator malfunction in his display,\" said Nurcahyo, confirming that the jet was in the pilot's control, set to manual.\n\nBoeing, the manufacturer of the 737 MAX 8, and US aviation investigators at the NTSB have been working with Indonesian experts on the analysis of the flight data recorder in Indonesia.\n\nBoeing did not respond to a request for a comment by CNN. Lion Air declined to comment.\n\nPlane was intact when it crashed, investigators say\n\nLion Air Flight 610 was intact with its engines running when it crashed at high speed into the Java Sea, Tjahjono said Monday.\n\nTjahjono said that due to the small size of the debris found and loss of the plane's engine blades, investigators determined that Flight 610 did not explode in the air, but was in \"good shape\" before it crashed 13 minutes after takeoff.\n\nSpeaking with victims' families in Jakarta, Soerjanto said there was a technical problem with the new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft on the day of the crash. He did not provide further details about the problem.\n\nAuthorities previously confirmed that the pilots flying the same plane on another route the day before the crash had experienced technical issues.\n\nThe confirmation of Flight 610's condition comes as divers continue to search for the aircraft's missing cockpit voice recorder (CVR), commonly known as a black box, which could help investigators piece together the plane's final moments before it crashed.\n\nA remotely operated underwater vehicle is prepared for a search of Flight 610's cockpit voice recorder.\n\nLocating the cockpit voice recorder\n\nThe head of Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency, Basarnas, said Sunday that after initially hearing a \"ping\" from the CVR on Saturday, diving teams could no longer hear a signal from the device.\n\n\"We checked that spot, located around 50 meters from the location of finding the first black box. But we can't find the CVR yet,\" Muhammad Syaugi said.\n\nMeanwhile, the plane's other black box, the flight data recorder, was located Thursday, and investigators said it showed Flight 610 had performed 19 flights -- including its final flight.\n\nSix black box experts from four different countries are now analyzing the flight data recorder to piece together the last moments of the 737 before it crashed.\n\nSyaugi said that the search operation had been extended and would continue through Wednesday.\n\nThe focus of continuing efforts will be to recover additional victim remains and to locate the CVR, he said.\n\nAnalysts say finding the cockpit voice recorder is imperative if investigators are to determine whether the crash has implications for other airlines collectively operating thousands of Boeing 737 flights around the world each day.\n\nThe ill-fated Lion Air flight JT 610's flight data recorder was recovered from the Java Sea on Thursday.\n\nPilot reported plane issues\n\nThe day before the crash, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 -- which had only around 800 flying hours on the clock -- had experienced a significant drop in altitude on a flight from Bali to Jakarta, passenger Robbi Gaharu said.\n\n\"After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked. It dropped about 400 feet,\" said Gaharu, adding that he had confirmed the height of the drop on a flight-tracking website. He said the drop felt like falling into \"a really, really deep hole.\"\n\nLion Air confirmed to CNN that the same aircraft was used on that route, and Indonesian authorities confirmed that the pilot on the flight reported a problem with one of the plane's instruments.\n\nCapt. Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi, managing director of Lion Group, said that all information had been handed over to Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Commission, and he could not answer any questions about the fault because of a nondisclosure agreement signed to accommodate the investigation.\n\nThe fast-moving currents and muddy waters of the crash site in the Java Sea have hindered recovery efforts since the plane came down.\n\nOn Saturday, Syaugi confirmed that one of the more than 100 divers involved in the search had died.\n\nSyahrul Anto, 48, was found unconscious Friday after his diving partner noticed he had disappeared, said Syaugi. He was immediately brought back to shore and was attended by doctors but Syaugi said that \"God had a different plan.\"\n\nIndonesian navy personnel searching for victims and fuselage of Lion Air Flight 610 Sunday.\n\nAnto was a qualified, senior diver \"who devoted his life for our country,\" Syaugi said.\n\nSyaugi, who is responsible for the diving team, said those involved \"are very qualified divers, outstanding divers, with long experience. They are come from Navy special task forces, from the police, from the Basarnas team, and some are volunteers from diving clubs.\"", "Hong Kong (CNN Business) Masa Son is sticking with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe CEO and founder of Japan's SoftBank ( SFTBF ) on Monday expressed \"strong regret\" over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi , but said his company can't sever its financial ties to Saudi Arabia. He said SoftBank wouldn't take any more Saudi cash until the truth about the murder was known.\n\nThe Japanese billionaire has built up strong ties with the Saudi government and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The kingdom provided nearly half the $93 billion that SoftBank raised for its Vision Fund, which has made investments in startups such as WeWork and Slack.\n\nThe killing of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was \"a terrible incident that should never have happened,\" Son said Monday in his first public comments since an international outcry erupted over the journalist's death.\n\nBut SoftBank had \"received funds to invest from the people of Saudi Arabia,\" Son added. As horrific as the killing was, the company believed it should \"fulfill its responsibility for the future of the Saudi people,\" Son said during an earnings presentation in Tokyo.", "(CNN) \u2014 Diwali is one of the most important Hindu festivals in India , but the colorful customs and meanings associated with it can vary depending on where you travel in the country.\n\nIn the north, Diwali is often a raucous affair, marked by a cacophony of firecrackers on the streets and a flourish of ceremonial gambling in the home.\n\nThe wealthier urban dwellers splurge on gold, jewelry, clothes and expensive gifts such as electronics, which they buy for themselves and their loved ones.\n\nIn the quiet villages, such as those dotted around the vast state of Maharashtra in the west of India, the Festival of Lights celebration is generally a simpler affair, defined by humble offerings and wholesome feasts.\n\nFew, if any, firecrackers are burst and many follow their own particular tribal traditions. Most villagers try to buy new clothes, but few can afford gold, jewelry or elaborate gifts.\n\nThe annual dates of Diwali are as fluid as types of revelry you'll find. It's generally celebrated for five days, with the biggest day being the third one.\n\nIn 2018, northern India marks that day on Wednesday, November 7. However, it falls on Tuesday, November 6, in southern India, where it's called Deepavali.\n\nHere's a look at some of the most popular ways to celebrate.\n\nCommon traditions\n\nSome Diwali rituals are common across most of the subcontinent.\n\nIn both city and countryside, small oil lamps made of clay (diyas) are placed at the thresholds of homes, shops and offices throughout the five-day affair to celebrate the legend of the return of the Hindu god, Lord Rama, to his kingdom after 14 years in exile. According to mythology, his people lit diyas to welcome his return.\n\nIn villages, the rangolis are sometimes drawn on top of fresh cow dung. AFP/Getty Images\n\nHindus in cities and villages also believe that during Diwali the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, will visit their homes if they are lit, clean and beautifully decorated.\n\nWindows and doors are left open to let the goddess in, and homes are cleaned from top to bottom.\n\nBrightly colored rangolis are drawn using fingers on the ground at the entrances to homes and offices. These geometric designs are usually symbols of nature. Their purpose is to welcome guests and to encourage Lakshmi inside.\n\nRelated content 6 things you should know about Diwali\n\nGambling card games are often played in villages and cities, as it is generally considered auspicious to gamble during Diwali.\n\nThis springs from a legend that a Hindu deity played a dice game with his consort on the fourth day of Diwali and she won. Some Hindus believe Lakshmi can be invoked through gambling.\n\nPlace your bets\n\nGambling parties are an especially popular pastime during Diwali in Mumbai. The parties typically start at 10 p.m. in bungalows and farmhouses and continue until 5 a.m.\n\n\"People don't mind losing -- it's part of the ambiance and people are having fun,\" says Vikram Mehta, founder of Red Om Entertainment in Mumbai. \"Everyone dresses up, everyone is on holiday, everyone is inviting each other to their homes, there is a lot of warmth.\"\n\nVarious games are played. The most popular is Teen Patti (three-card brag), and blackjack and poker are also favorites.\n\n\"People sit on mattresses on the floor. There are rooms where the kids play for fun and then other rooms with the higher stakes,\" Mehta says. The houses are decorated with diyas, people dress in traditional Indian dress, servants wander around with platters of kebabs, biryani and Indian sweets, he adds.\n\nAcross the country, Indian sweets -- known as mithai -- are exchanged and people have large family gatherings in their homes.\n\nNew year, new accounts\n\nDiwali marks the start of the new Hindu financial year and many businesses open new accounts books. AFP/Getty Images\n\nDiwali also marks the start of the new Hindu financial year, and many businessmen, traders and shopkeepers open new account books. Business people in certain states, particularly Gujarat, worship their account books.\n\nThere are various other rituals celebrated in towns and villages on each of the five days. For example, on the last day of Diwali in many parts of India, a sister cooks for her brother and he bestows gifts on her in celebration of the love between siblings.\n\n\"The modern world is changing, and festivals are the only way to keep our culture and traditions alive. For us, Diwali is the victory of good over evil, the returning of good back into our lives and starting a new year with a positive approach and forgetting all the bad that has happened,\" says Mumbai housewife Heena Damle.\n\n\"You have tables ready with sweets to offer if someone comes to your home,\" adds her nephew Pranav Damle.\n\nLighting up the night\n\nTypically firecrackers are set off from dusk, often throughout the night. The noise is believed to herald the defeat of evil and catch the attention of the gods.\n\nRag picker Santosh, whose family migrated from a Maharashtrian village to Mumbai, says: \"People in the villages have limited means, so it's not very spectacular. In Mumbai, the rich celebrate it with a lot of pomp. We witness huge fireworks and can get such fancy crackers.\"\n\nSome, however, are concerned that the original traditions of Diwali are being lost in cities.\n\nInir Pinheiro is managing director of Grassroutes , which promotes responsible village tourism, and takes urban Indians on trips to tribal villages. He says many of them want to \"see an unadulterated way of celebrating Diwali, a less noisy place and to reconnect with the people.\"\n\n\"I think people in the cities are beginning to realize there is a lot of show in the way it is celebrated and a large materialistic aspect to it. People want to see if there is something more to the celebration,\" Pinheiro says.\n\nRelated content India's 30 most beautiful places\n\nHopes for the harvest\n\nIn the 500-person village of Purushwadi in Maharashtra, families of five typically live in stone houses of two bedrooms. Dutta Kondar, a farmer from the Mahadeo Koli tribe, says that Diwali is a \"celebration of the end of the harvest of kharif (rain-fed crops).\"\n\nSince harvest is when the villagers make money, villagers carry out Lakshmi puja (prayer ritual) on their assets at Diwali, giving thanks and praying for a good harvest to come.\n\n\"We conduct a small puja of our cattle, grain and cash,\" Kondar says. Family members hold a plate of offerings to the gods and chant prayers while rotating the plate around the assets, he explains.\n\n\"To make sure our bodies are prepared for the winter, we eat lots of oil and sweets,\" Kondar adds.\n\n\"Whenever anyone enters their house, the villagers offer each other sweets. But they don't buy presents for each other -- money being a big constraint,\" Pinheiro says.\n\nVillage values\n\nLike many rural villages across India, Purushwadi has its own particular rituals. Pinheiro says one of the most popular is the local singing ceremony.\n\n\"This is when children go round the houses holding hand-made lanterns made of sticks and twigs and they sing Marathi songs for the benefit of residents of the homes. In return they are given oil and grain,\" Pinheiro says.", "\u0637\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 (CNN)-- \u062a\u0639\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633

what the country's constitutional crisis means for a bigger contest: the race for influence in the Indian Ocean region.\n\nPolitical turmoil in the island nation was triggered late on October 26 when Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena appointed his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, after summarily firing the incumbent, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who insists he's still in charge. The two are now set to face off in parliament in a confidence vote.\n\n\"The move caught me and most observers here in Washington and even (the Sri Lankan capital) Colombo by surprise,\" said Jeff Smith, a fellow at the DC based Heritage Foundation think tank.\n\nSirisena came to power in 2015 with Wickremesinghe's support after breaking away from Rajapaksa, who was accused by rights groups of increasingly authoritarian behavior during his time as president between 2005 and 2015, especially during the final years of a brutal civil war that ended in May 2009.\n\nRajapaksa's reign had also seen an influx of Chinese investment in Sri Lanka: between 2005 and 2014, Beijing investments and contracts totaled more than $15 billion, according to the American Enterprise Institute, raising eyebrows in Washington and its ally New Delhi.\n\nNew era\n\nRajapaksa's ouster raised hopes for democracy and an improvement in human rights in Sri Lanka.\n\nFor many in the US and India, it was also seen as an opportunity to counter Chinese influence in New Delhi's backyard, with the new Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government coming to power \"pledging to revisit and revise some of the deals Rajapaksa had signed with China,\" said Smith.\n\n\"It ultimately found itself in a compromised economic position and forced to renegotiate rather than cancel some of the contracts,\" he explained.\n\nSri Lanka's former president and new prime minister Mahinda Rajapakse (2R) on October 28, 2018.\n\nStruggling to service its debts, in 2017 Sri Lanka moved to lease the Chinese-funded port in the south -- to Chinese state-owned firms.\n\nStill, in recent years Colombo also \"did a good job assuaging some of India's concerns about Chinese activity in Sri Lanka and ... really significantly improving cooperation with the US over the last few years,\" said Smith.\n\nAccording to Smith, some elements of cooperation had been halted or limited during Rajapaksa's term over concerns of human rights violations and the military's conduct during the civil war.\n\n\"Some of those avenues... resumed or were upgraded after the new government came to power in 2015,\" Smith said, highlighting progress on both the economic and military fronts, with a US aircraft carrier visiting Colombo in 2017.\n\nUncertain future\n\nBut with Sirisena now backing Rajapaksa again, the question is what happens now. Will China have the upper hand if Rajapaksa displaces Wickremesinghe?\n\nIt might not be so simple, according to Constantino Xavier of the Brookings Institution's Indian arm.\n\n\"People quite superficially tend to portray Mahinda Rajapaksa in particular as a primitive, anti-India, pro-China person and conversely Ranil Wickremesinghe somehow as the leader of more pro-India factions,\" said Xavier, pointing, as an example, to a recent visit to New Delhi by Rajapaksa.\n\nSri Lankan soldiers in Colombo on October 28, 2018.\n\n\"After burning some of his bridges with Delhi, (he is) being smart enough to rebuild them. His visit in September was part of that exercise,\" said Xavier.\n\nIndia was clearly concerned about the level of Chinese influence and activity during Rajapaksa's last term in power. But it's likely that China, with its financial muscle, is here to stay, no matter who is in power, in Sri Lanka or in the other small countries across the region, said Xavier.\n\n\"This applies to the Maldives, this applies to Nepal, this applies to Bangladesh and it applies to Sri Lanka,\" said Xavier, adding that although some countries will continue to work with India, Chinese money means that cooperation is no exclusive.\n\n\"The Chinese are now and will be permanently involved economically in these countries.

Trump also tested constitutional norms and engineered a sharp shift in the country's attitude toward the rest of the world.\n\nDemocrats continue to hold a double-digit lead over Republicans in a generic congressional ballot among likely voters, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. The party's 55% to 42% advantage in the new poll mirrors their lead in early October and is about the same as the 10-point edge they held just after Labor Day.\n\nBut as they face their first chance to judge Trump's performance, they could also register satisfaction with a historically primed economy and a President who has kept many of his election promises, however controversial, and is running an undeniably consequential administration that has managed to engineer a generational conservative shift to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe first result would represent a rebuke to Trump's entire political approach: His failure to tame his volatile instincts in the interests of national unity and his unwillingness to embrace the presidency itself as a national trust.\n\nThe second would convey acquiescence for the President's scorched-earth tactics, indefatigable and domineering personality, fear-mongering warnings that the nation is under assault from an invading immigrant tide of dark-skinned criminals and approval of his creed of \"America First\" nationalism.\n\n\"You saw that barbed wire going up. That barbed wire -- yes sir, we have barbed wire going up. Because you know what? We're not letting these people invade our country,\" Trump said at a rally in Georgia on Sunday, defending his decision to dispatch troops to the border in what critics have branded a political \"stunt.\"\n\nWhile the campaign has seen intense skirmishes over health care, immigration, education and the best way to share the dividends of high growth, low unemployment and rising wages, Trump has, as he does all the time about everything else, made the campaign about himself.\n\nIn the most inflammatory closing argument of any campaign in modern memory, Trump seized on a group of migrants heading toward the southern US border from hundreds of miles away in Mexico as a metaphor for his hardline and racially insulting rhetoric on immigration. His searing nationalist rhetoric and tearing of cultural fault lines drew criticism that he had crossed a dangerous line after a gunman killed 11 people in a synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh and a Trump supporter mailed bombs to the President's top targets in politics and the media, including two former Presidents.\n\nBut it is a measure of the country's volatile political climate and the lessons of Trump's logic-defying win in 2016 that no one can say for sure how Tuesday night will unfold.\n\nTrump v. Obama\n\nAt times on Sunday, it almost felt like Trump was running a campaign against the man whom he has defined himself against, his predecessor in the Oval Office, Barack Obama. The 44th president is making the most direct assault on Trump yet attempted by any prominent Democrat. Ten years to the day after he delivered his soaring victory speech in Grant Park, Chicago, Obama doubled down on hope, painting it as the antidote to what he said were the dark impulses exemplified by his successor, and warned America was at a crossroads.\n\n\"In the closing weeks of this election, we've seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric, to try to turn us on one another,\" Obama said in Gary, Indiana, revisiting, a city familiar from his 2008 campaign.\n\n\"The good news is, Indiana, when you vote, you can reject that kind of politics,\" he said. \"When you vote you can be a check on bad behavior. When you vote you can choose hope over fear.\"\n\nTuesday's election represents another clash between Trump's capacity to subvert political norms and the weight of history and electoral logic.\n\nOmens look poor for Republicans, since Trump's approval rating sits between 40% and 45% in most polls and history suggests that first-term presidents who are that unpopular typically lead their parties to heavy losses.\n\nDemocrats are increasingly confident they can recapture the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years and are banking on a backlash against the President from voters who stayed home in 2016. Their path to power lies through more diverse, suburban and affluent districts where Trump's cultural warfare plays poorly.\n\nBut Trump's ironclad loyalty from a political base that sees him as a hero and a guardian of traditional, largely white, working-class life means that Republicans are strong favorites to keep the Senate, as vulnerable Democrats fight for political life in states where Trump won big two years ago like Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Montana.\n\nCultural and racial turmoil is also raging in several high-stakes gubernatorial races that, on a good night for Democrats, could produce the nation's first African American female governor, Stacey Abrams in Georgia, and Florida's first black chief executive in Andrew Gillum. In Wisconsin, an often liberal-leaning state that Trump crows about winning in 2016, a national political figure, Republican Gov. Scott Walker is facing yet another uphill battle to retain power.\n\nWhat a shift in power would mean for the nation\n\nThe most likely outcome agreed upon by pollsters and pundits on Tuesday is one that would eloquently enshrine America's polarization -- Democrats would win a narrow majority in the House and Republicans would keep the Senate, and possibly gain a few seats.\n\nSuch a scenario would represent a significant threat to the White House, since it would empower Democratic committee chairmen to subject the White House to unprecedented scrutiny on everything from Trump's tax returns and business dealings to scandal in government agencies.\n\nA Democratic-held House would also be a more receptive audience if special counsel Robert Mueller finds wrongdoing by the President and his campaign involving Russian election meddling, and theoretically would give Trump's congressional opponents the power to initiative impeachment proceedings.\n\nWhile the loss of the House would cripple Trump's hopes of adding to a thin legislative agenda, retaining GOP control of the Senate would preserve the other key legacy thrust of the President's agenda, the remaking of the federal judiciary by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Any Supreme Court vacancy over the next two years would allow Trump to consolidate his most significant achievement, the building of a conservative majority on the nation's top bench.\n\nAnd if Republicans hold the Senate, any impeachment proceedings in the House are unlikely to result in a trial of the President and possible ejection from office, unless any charges that might come are especially egregious.\n\nShould Democrats trigger a \"blue wave\" that sweeps away the Senate as well as the House, all bets are off for the Trump presidency. There would be questions asked about his fear-laden campaign strategy and how it could lead to an even bigger disaster in the 2020 presidential campaign that effectively begins on Wednesday morning.\n\nIf the GOP clings to the House and keeps the Senate, Trump would likely claim validation for his hardline leadership rooted in keeping his political base intact and vilifying opponents. That could enhance his power in a purge of restraining influences in his Cabinet that would augur a tumultuous period at home and abroad until November 2020.\n\nThe President's reputation for defying every political convention and omen would remain intact. And Democrats would have failed \u2014 yet again \u2014 to frame an effective counter-narrative to the President's strongman rule.", "Michael Kugelman is deputy director and senior associate for South Asia with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, DC.

The views expressed are his own.\n\n(CNN) On October 31, Pakistan's Supreme Court acquitted Asia Bibi , a Christian woman languishing on death row since being convicted of blasphemy in 2010. It was a landmark decision for Pakistan, where the law is frequently unkind to religious minorities, and particularly to those accused of blasphemy.\n\nReligious hardliners, led by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a new political party, immediately took to the streets in protest. Several days later, Pakistan's government, led by Prime Minister Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, reached a deal that made generous concessions to the protestors, who want Bibi executed. Islamabad agreed to take steps to prevent Bibi -- newly acquitted of all charges by the highest court in the land -- from leaving the country. She remains in Pakistan, her life in danger.\n\nThe protestors were at times violent and led by a party that calls for liberal activists to die and uses a rallying cry of \"kill all blasphemers.\" They were extremists, and Islamabad gave in to them. It wasn't the first time, and it won't be the last.\n\nA year ago, when the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PLMN) party was running the government, the TLP led a sit-in outside Islamabad that demanded the resignation of Pakistan's law minister for making a small change to a religious oath uttered by new parliamentarians. The official resigned, and the change to the oath was reversed.\n\nThen, several months ago, following pressure from religious hardliners, the current government asked Princeton professor Atif Mian, a distinguished Pakistani economist, to step down just days after having appointed him to serve on a new economic advisory council. The reason? He is an Ahmadi, a deeply persecuted religious minority in Pakistan.\n\nInitially, Khan telegraphed a desire to take a hard line against last week's protestors. He addressed the nation and described the unrest as unacceptable and a disservice to Islam.\n\nKhan, however, did not walk the talk. That's because, so far as the Pakistani state is concerned, the risks of staring down the TLP and its ilk are simply too great. The premier's tough words are likely to ring hollow.\n\nCrackdowns on Islamists -- especially in a deeply conservative and religious state -- risk triggering large-scale unrest. In 2007, President Pervez Musharraf used force against religious students and militants holed up in Islamabad's Red Mosque. The operation killed dozens and spawned numerous retaliatory attacks. It also led to the formal establishment of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), which terrorized the country for nearly a decade. The sobering lessons of 2007 haven't been forgotten.\n\nAdditionally, taking on the TLP has potentially damaging political costs -- because the PTI has religious conservative supporters, but also because the TLP has become an ally of both the PTI and Pakistan's military.\n\nThe TLP sit-in last November successfully pressured and weakened the PLMN government, with which the PTI and the military had sparred for years. Shortly after that sit-in, Khan claimed PTI members were ready to join it. The TLP also bagged more than two million votes in Pakistan's 2018 election -- enough to cut into the PMLN's vote bank.\n\nThe TLP's anti-state threats last week highlight how it could morph into a Frankenstein's monster -- another case of a Pakistani state asset turning into an adversary. It's a scenario the government would much rather avoid.\n\nIn effect, both the PTI and the military have little incentive to antagonize the TLP and its allies.\n\nThe consequences of a hands-off policy are stark. So long as Islamabad dishes out the kid gloves treatment, it will struggle to curb the violent extremism that has long stalked Pakistan. With these hardliners moving into the political mainstream and contesting elections, their narratives of hate are gaining more traction across society\u2014a space already suffocated by toxic ideas propagated by school textbooks, religious leaders, and the mass media.\n\nAdditionally, if the state won't confront those waging violent protests and calling for mutiny within the military, then it certainly won't crack down on those that sit quietly in Pakistan -- think Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Haqqani Network -- and help the security establishment pursue its goals in India and Afghanistan. These outfits don't stage attacks in Pakistan, but their violent ideologies further entrench extremism there.\n\nThere's an unsettling irony here. By appeasing the TLP and its ilk, Pakistan could hasten the very destabilization it hopes to avoid.

We know what their positions are. And President Trump has made his position very clear: no economic relief until we have achieved our ultimate objective,\" he said.\n\nRisk of talks collapsing\n\nExperts say the hardline negotiating positions staked out by both sides have resulted in a protracted stalemate.\n\nNorth Korea is only willing to give up its nuclear weapons once it has established a peaceful and trusting relationship with the United States; the United States is only willing to form a peaceful relationship with North Korea until after it gives up its nuclear weapons.\n\nThis type of posturing could easily spiral out of control, as it did in 2017, says Adam Mount, a senior fellow and the director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\n\"This is a more direct threat to collapse talks and resume the nuclear program at full speed than we've seen since negotiations since started. So in that regards it's a shift from their previous position,\" Mount said.\n\nHowever, experts like Mount say the North Korean position does not come as a total surprise -- staking out hardline positions in state media ahead of diplomatic meetings has long been a favored tactic in Pyongyang's playbook.\n\n\"It's a clear play for leverage, it's a clear play to set the agenda in the upcoming round of diplomacy, but there's still a very real risk that it does seriously damage the negotiation process.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Moon: The masterful dealmaker Replay More Videos ...

Pyongyang's biggest priorities are believed to be sanctions relief and bringing about a formal end to the Korean War.\n\nBut experts say North Korea's moves so far are largely cosmetic and easily reversible.\n\nJUST WATCHED US cancels military exercise with South Korea Replay More Videos ...

They shouldn't be negotiating in pieces as they arise,\" she said.", "(CNN) \u2014 The year 2018 marks the centennial of the end of World War I.\n\nKnown at the time as the Great War, the five-year struggle changed Europe and the world forever.\n\nTo recognize and celebrate the centennial, the Tower of London is hosting a stunning event called \"Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers.\"\n\nThe eight-night event in London , which runs from November 4 to 11, fills the Tower's moat area with thousands of brightly lit torches to commemorate the many people who died during the war.\n\nThe final night, November 11, is Remembrance Day in the UK and the anniversary of the day the war was declared over \"at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.\"\n\nChris Skaife, Ravenmaster at the Tower of London, tells CNN Travel about his unconventional job.\n\nThe ceremony at the Tower of London begins at dusk, with the torches going from 5 to 9 each night.\n\nFirst, a bugler plays \"The Last Post.\" This bugle call is traditionally played at military funerals or in honor of the war dead.\n\nThen, the yeoman warders begin the process of lighting the torches.\n\nYeoman warders, better known by their nickname \"Beefeaters,\" are the traditional guards of the Tower of London and of the crown jewels. They also offer tours of the Tower to visitors.\n\nThroughout the UK and the Commonwealth, many people wear red poppies on Remembrance Day, recalling a line from the famous poem \"In Flanders Fields\" by the Canadian John McCrae: \"In Flanders fields the poppies blow / Between the crosses, row on row.\"\n\nl e v a r t\n\nThere are other events commemorating the end of World War I in the UK and beyond.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the Smithsonian Museums unveiled several new exhibits about World War I that opened on April 6, 2018, the anniversary of the day the United States entered the war.", "New York (CNN) Before arriving for jury duty on Monday, prospective panel members filled out a lengthy questionnaire that might have given them pause.\n\n\"The case for which you are summoned involves the defendant JOAQUIN ARCHIVALDO GUZMAN LOERA, also known as 'El Chapo,' \" read query No. 48. \"Have you read, seen or heard anything about the defendant, the case, or people involved?\"\n\nIt would be hard not to.\n\n\"In some ways, this case is unprecedented; the amount of public attention has been extraordinary,\" Brooklyn US District Court Judge Brian Cogan wrote in a recent ruling.\n\nThat will be a major challenge during jury selection, which began Monday for Mexican cartel boss Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.\n\nEverything is extraordinary in the long-awaited case against a defendant once considered the world's most powerful drug trafficker.\n\nThe international scope of an alleged criminal enterprise that spanned continents \"makes it an outlier among even the biggest drug prosecutions to date,\" Cogan wrote last week.\n\nGuzman rose from being a teenage marijuana grower to earn nearly $14 billion during his years as boss of the Sinaloa drug cartel, according to federal prosecutors in New York.\n\nA Robin Hood-like figure celebrated in ballads in his native Mexico, he was once featured in Forbes' rankings of the world's most powerful people. The Sinaloa cartel was prolifically violent in his country's long and bloody drug wars.\n\n\"There are not many cases whose allegations are dramatized in popular television productions and podcasts before the trial has even begun,\" Cogan wrote.\n\nThe jury will be anonymous and partly sequestered\n\nThe 61-year-old Guzman has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of international drug trafficking, conspiring to murder rivals, gun charges and money laundering, he faces a sentence of life in prison.\n\nGiven the defendant's violent history, Cogan has ordered that the jury be anonymous and partly sequestered. The names, addresses and places of employment of prospective jurors will be kept secret for the duration of a trial that could last four months.\n\nJurors will even be transported to and from the courthouse by armed US marshals.\n\n\"It's going to be tough picking a jury no matter what,\" said Paula Hannaford-Agor, director of the Center for Juries Studies at the National Center for State Courts.\n\nDefense attorney Eduardo Balarezo has argued that an anonymous jury \"under armed guard\" would be prejudicial to his client and \"serve to bolster the government's proof by creating the impression that Mr. Guzman is guilty and dangerous.\"\n\nGuzman's defense team has also complained they have not had enough time to go over the voluminous evidence being presented against their client, including more than 100,000 audio recordings and recently received binders with 14,000 pages of new documents.\n\nOn Monday, the selection of the men and women who will decide his fate began under a veil of secrecy.\n\nGuzman sat in the courtroom, dressed casually: He wore a white collared shirt -- with two top buttons open -- a navy blazer, and a brown belt and shoes. There were about 10 US Marshals in courtroom.\n\nAbout 100 potential jurors from the 920 that returned the questionnaire were summoned to the court. They were brought into the courtroom in groups of 20 and will only be identified by a number throughout the trial.\n\nThey came face to face with Guzman, although the judge instructed the first group of potential jurors not to look at him.\n\nThe jury will ultimately consist of 12 principal jurors and six alternates.\n\nThe courtroom will be closed to the public during jury selection\n\nOpening statements are scheduled for November 13. Before then, prosecutors and defense lawyers will question potential jurors about politically charged topics that include federal narcotics policy and law enforcement relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\n\"There are a lot of touch points where jurors are likely to get excused for cause above and beyond just the, 'Yeah, this sounds like a long and unpleasant subject matter,'\" Agor said.\n\nPotential jury members are also expected to be queried during voir dire about their views on the legalization of narcotics as well as their experiences with substance abuse and violent crime.\n\n\"It is critical that prospective jurors be forthcoming about their views on these topics, as well as any preconceived notions they might have about defendant,\" Cogan wrote.\n\n\"There is too great a risk that the public's presence will have a chilling effect on prospective jurors' answers to these hot-button issues to allow public access during voir dire.\"\n\nThe courtroom will be closed to the public during the questioning of potential jurors, but five pool reporters from accredited media organizations will be present.\n\nProsecutors will attempt to show that Guzman allegedly killed or ordered the deaths of dozens of rivals and law enforcement officers.\n\n\"Defendant is accused of leading a violent criminal organization with an alleged history of threatening and harming witnesses and interfering with the legal process,\" Crogan said in his ruling.\n\n\"The prospective jurors may be concerned that if they voice an unpopular or biased view, members of the public observing the proceedings -- who, unlike the press, are not vetted -- will connect that response to their appearance in a way that could put their safety at risk.\"\n\nJury selection will touch on 'sensitive and controversial issues'\n\nThe case against Guzman will be built in part on the testimony of more than a dozen cooperating witnesses, including former cartel associates already incarcerated or who have been given new identities and relocated by the US government. Their names have remained unknown to Guzman's defense lawyers until the eve of the trial, with prosecutors arguing that witnesses in previous cases have turned up dead.\n\nFederal prosecutors have asked the court to prohibit defense attorneys from referring to recent comments made by President Donald Trump about cooperating witnesses. In August, Trump decried those who testify against former confidants to ease legal troubles, bemoaning the longstanding practice. \"It's called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal,\" Trump said in an interview.\n\n\"All of these topics are at the forefront of current public discussion and debate, and they often provoke strong reactions,\" Cogan wrote.\n\nThe judge said that other \"sensitive and controversial issues\" to be examined during voir dire included \"prospective jurors' biases against persons of certain races, ethnicities, or national origins.\"\n\n\"It is interesting to try the case in this political climate,\" said Shan Wu, a former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst. \"The politics will enter it so much because of the time that we're in. ... That does present an unusual environment for a criminal trial like this.\"\n\nGuzman, also known for his dramatic prison escapes in Mexico, was extradited to the United States in January 2017.\n\nHe has been held in solitary confinement in a cold, small cell at a federal lockup in Manhattan while awaiting trial, which has already been delayed twice.\n\n\"This case has attracted observers, commentators, reporters, and readers from across the globe,\" Cogan wrote. \"The interest in these proceedings is international and prospective jurors understand that. They will also understand what that means -- that the world is watching them.\"", "\u0648\u0627\u0634\u0646\u0637\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a

American Academy of Pediatrics has hardened its stance against spanking children as a form of parental discipline.\n\nIn a new policy statement, published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, the pediatricians' group recommends that adults caring for children use \"healthy forms of discipline\" -- such as positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviors, setting limits and setting expectations -- and not use spanking, hitting, slapping, threatening, insulting, humiliating or shaming.\n\nThe policy statement updates guidance published in 1998 that recommended \"parents be encouraged and assisted in developing methods other than spanking in response to undesired behavior.\"\n\n\"In the 20 years since that policy was first published, there's been a great deal of additional research, and we're now much stronger in saying that parents should never hit their child and never use verbal insults that would humiliate or shame the child,\" said Dr. Robert Sege, first author of the policy statement and a pediatrician at the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.\n\n\"This is much stronger than the previous advice,\" he said. \"The new policy encourages pediatricians to discuss the data about different kinds of discipline with parents so, of course, they can make their own decisions in how they chose to raise their children.\"\n\nThe policy statement describes corporal punishment as \"noninjurious, open-handed hitting with the intention of modifying child behavior\" and indicates that spanking is considered a form of such physical punishment.\n\nHow to discipline without spanking\n\nThe statement encourages pediatricians to counsel the parents of their patients when they may want guidance about the use of spanking. Sege said there are other forms of discipline that parents can employ, no matter their child's age.\n\nFor instance, for children younger than 1 who might be misbehaving, \"the best thing to do is just pick them up and move them somewhere else, distract them, change the subject -- and that's usually all they need and they can handle it,\" he said. \"Your average 6-month-old child doesn't have the ability to learn the rules. They will eventually.\"\n\nFor toddlers and preschoolers, Sege recommended using the time-out method , which involves a child sitting quietly by him- or herself.\n\n\"What we talk to parents about is paying attention to your child's good behavior and paying less attention when they're misbehaving,\" Sege said.\n\n\"Kids like attention, they crave that, and if they misbehave, we recommend something called a time-out,\" he said. \"If they're 2 years old, you have to ignore them for two entire minutes.\"\n\nFor older children, Sege said, typically allowing the natural consequence of misbehavior play out can be effective.\n\n\"So if they run out in the street, you don't want the natural consequence to be that they get run over by a car. But a natural consequence might be that they have to hold your hand when they're in the street or they can't go out on their own past a busy street until you've observed them always looking both ways,\" Sege said.\n\nIn other words, holding Mom's or Dad's hand becomes the consequence.\n\nAll in all, \"the loving relationship between a child and their parents is the most important relationship that there is,\" Sege said.\n\n\"Parents can use that relationship to teach their children right from wrong without inserting violence, shame and humiliation into that relationship,\" he said. \"As a result, children are more likely to grow up feeling secure and positive, knowing how to regulate their own behavior.\"\n\nThe science on spanking and child development\n\nThe policy statement is consistent with what research has found on the relationship between corporal punishment and adverse outcomes among children, said Rebecca Ryan, a developmental psychologist and associate professor at Georgetown University who was not involved in the statement.\n\nYet Ryan, who has studied the use of corporal punishment, noted that only a correlational relationship has been found, not a causal one.\n\n\"Nobody has randomly assigned children to receive different types of parenting or different types of discipline strategies, per se. ... So it's difficult for anybody to say spanking a child causes that child later on to be more aggressive, even though there are theories to suggest that could be why the correlation exists,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"Although all the evidence is correlational, there's little correlational evidence that it's an effective strategy, and if it were effective, you should see correlational evidence,\" she said.\n\n\"If it were an effective strategy, you would either see no correlation between spanking and child behavior, or you would see a correlation that's the opposite of what you do see,\" she said. \"What you see is a positive correlation between spanking and higher levels of behavior problems. If it were effective you should see the opposite.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince research shows only a correlational relationship, some question whether children who are more aggressive or misbehave more are subsequently spanked more -- and could that be why corporal punishment has been linked with higher levels of behavioral problems among children?\n\n\"There probably is reverse causation, but one of the things that some of the longitudinal research suggests is that when you look at kids over time -- so controlling for baseline rates of misbehavior -- children who are disciplined with corporal punishment versus those who are not, who have the same kinds of behavior problems, show increases in behavior problems over time in a way that children who aren't disciplined that way don't,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"So yes, there is probably some truth to the idea that kids who are predisposed to misbehavior for whatever reason are more likely to be spanked by parents who use that form of discipline than kids who are less likely to misbehave for whatever reason,\" she said. \"But it's also true that spanking is correlated with an increase in behavior problems over time among children with similar levels of misbehavior relative to nonphysical forms of discipline.\"", "(CNN) Warning: This post contains spoilers from the most recent episode of 'The Walking Dead'\n\nAndrew Lincoln made his exit from 'The Walking Dead' series on Sunday, but AMC is not done telling the story of Rick Grimes.\n\nThe network on Sunday announced a series of films about the character are in development, with the first expected to begin production early next year.\n\nChief Content Officer Scott M. Gimple, longtime producer of the series, will executive produce and write the films, which will star Lincoln.\n\nSunday's episode of 'The Walking Dead' had been billed as the last appearance by Lincoln on the mothership series. A surprise twist at the end of the episode revealed Grimes, who had been severely injured in an explosion, was not dead as his friends and fellow survivors had presumed. He was rescued by helicopter in the final moments of the episode.\n\nRead More", "CNN's Tom Foreman discusses the upcoming United States Midterm elections and the potential shift in power that could impact legislation in the Senate and the House of Representatives.", "CNN's Don Lemon discusses the importance of the 2018 midterm elections and says while one president is stoking fear in voters, another is sounding an alarm.", "(CNN) The following contains spoilers about the Nov. 4 (fifth) episode of \"The Walking Dead's\" ninth season.\n\nHaving leaned into the promotional benefits of Andrew Lincoln's departure, \"The Walking Dead\" couldn't exactly give him a low-key going-away party. Sunday's episode thus endeavored to send Lincoln off with a bang -- literally, as it turned out --still indulging in the coyness that has come to plague the series, while simultaneously seeking to plant seeds for the future.\n\nMuch of the episode -- which picked up with Rick skewered by a metal pole and surrounded by zombies -- reached back to the program's past, a magical mystery tour through its best (and better) days, featuring a number of cameos by since-departed regulars.\n\nThere was a good deal of nostalgia in that -- seeing Jon Bernthal, Sonequa Martin-Green and especially the late Scott Wilson, who died last month -- as Rick kept slipping into what amounted to a walking-dream state. Those interludes clearly represented an effort to serve long-time fans with an hour that lived up to the momentousness of losing the program's original star.\n\nStill, the writers backed away from a definitive finish after Rick went out in what appeared to be a blaze of glory, setting off an explosion on a bridge filled with walkers. As it turned out, the whole Rick's exit was a bit of a bait and switch, as AMC promptly announced a planned series of movies featuring Lincoln as the character, essentially asking fans to pay to see what they have grown accustomed to watching for free.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The tiny Pacific territory of New Caledonia has voted to remain part of France in a long-awaited independence referendum which saw a much closer final result than expected.\n\nA colonial legacy of an empire that no longer officially exists, New Caledonia is one of a handful of territories in the region which have long been governed from afar but are increasingly pushing for self-rule.\n\nThe islands came closest to independence than ever before Sunday, with 56% of voters choosing to remain part of France in the first of three possible referenda on the territory's future.\n\nAnother independence vote can be held in 2020 if the local government approves it.\n\nWhere?\n\nNew Caledonia is an archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean, around 1,120 kilometers (750 miles) east of Australia and 17,000 kilometers (10,500 miles) from metropolitan France.\n\nWhile some powers have been devolved to the islands, their population are French citizens and vote in the country's elections, one of 12 overseas territories France retained sovereignty over since the end of colonialism.\n\nAround 40% of the population are indigenous Kanaks, with the next largest ethnic group being ethnic Europeans, at just over 27% in the latest census.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWhile the first European to sight New Caledonia was British explorer James Cook, who named it after the Latin term for today's Scotland, the islands were officially annexed by France in 1853 on the order of Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nIn the wake of World War II and a general movement towards decolonization worldwide, France adjusted how it dealt with its colonies and autonomy was gradually increased within areas which did not win full self-rule. This coincided in recent decades with greater organization by pro-independence parties in New Caledonia.\n\nAfter an occasionally violent separatist campaign, in 1998 the French government signed an agreement with an alliance of pro-independence political parties, the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), to hold three referendums on full independence slated for this year, 2020 and 2022, should the local government wish to hold them.\n\nBoards with campaign posters by different political groups favoring or opposing New Caledonia's independence from France are seen during the referendum in Noumea, on the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.\n\n\"Do you want New Caledonia to attain full sovereignty and become independent?\" the islands' 175,000 eligible voters were asked , with around 56% saying \"no,\" and 44% voting \"yes.\"\n\nThe result was much closer than expected, with some pre-referendum polls showing up to 70% of voters backed remaining part of France ahead of Sunday's vote.\n\nOf New Caledonia's three provinces, two -- North Province and the Loyalty Islands -- voted for independence while a majority of voters in South Province, which is largely ethnic European, chose to stay with France.\n\nA photo taken on November 4, 2018 in Paris shows a TV screen displaying French President Emmanuel Macron delivering a speech after the results from an independence referendum in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia.\n\nWhat was the reaction?\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said after the vote that he was \"proud that the majority of Caledonians have chosen to stay French.\"\n\n\"It is a mark of trust for France, our future and our values. Every one of us can feel and share in this pride,\" said Macron.\n\nLes Cal\u00e9doniennes et les Cal\u00e9doniens se sont exprim\u00e9s pour que la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie reste fran\u00e7aise. Cette \u00e9tape historique est une grande fiert\u00e9 pour la R\u00e9publique. Un seul vaincu, la tentation de la division. Un seul vainqueur, la paix. Maintenant, tournons-nous vers l'avenir. \u2014 Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 4, 2018\n\nThe French leader did not mention the possibility of holding future referendums, noted Les Nouvelles Cal\u00e9doniennes (LNC), the islands' main newspaper. The newspaper predicted that the strong showing by the \"yes\" campaign will be used as an argument for another poll in two years.\n\nHowever, the paper also noted that while a \"vast majority\" of indigenous Kanaks voted for independence, other ethnic groups did not, which it said showed a failure of pro-independence groups to win over voters outside their historic support base.\n\nThere was some minor violence post referendum, with roads near the capital blocked by wrecked cars and burning tires, according to La Premi\u00e8re , a French public broadcaster which covers the country's overseas territories. Video posted by LNC showed heavily armored police vehicles sent to the area to clear the affected roads.\n\nFirefighters try to extinguish a house set on fire in downtown Noumea overnight on November 5, 2018, after the results from an independence referendum in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nGiven the pro-French sentiment ahead of the polls, few supporters of independence expected victory in this weekend's referendum. Instead, most were looking to the future.\n\n\"For us it's just a question of time, and you know that time in Oceania is measured differently,\" FLNKS independence spokesperson Daniel Goa said in a speech at Australia's Lowy Institute last month.\n\n\"As long as a single Kanak person is standing, he will fight for his freedom,\" he added. \"We are this country, we are this land, it is Kanak and it will remain Kanak forever.\"\n\nAn activist holds the pro-independant flag during a meeting of the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) campaign for a 'yes' to New Caledonia's independence from France in Noumea.\n\nWhile an official date for the 2020 referendum has yet to be agreed, it is unlikely local authorities would not approve holding it as set out under the terms of the 1998 agreement.\n\nNew Caledonia's push for independence could also have a ripple effect in the region. Six other places in the Pacific are included on the United Nation's list of Non-Self-Governing Territories along with New Caledonia: American Samoa, French Polynesia, Guam (US territory), Pitcairn (British territory) and Tokelau (New Zealand territory).", "Tehran, Iran (CNN) A sea of protesters gathers outside the former US embassy in Iran. Hardline supporters of Iran's government, bused into the center of Tehran for the yearly rally, are marching past wall-sized graffiti of a skull-faced Statue of Liberty while chanting \"down with the USA.\"\n\nThe demonstration commemorates Iranian students' 1979 raiding of the embassy and their seizure of 54 American diplomats and citizens -- an act that severed relations between the two countries just months after Iran deposed the US-backed Shah and established itself as an Islamic Republic.\n\nNear the protest platform where Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards commander Mohamad Ali Jafari is about to deliver a speech, six men re-enact a hostage-taking scene.

As the US imposed its latest round of sanctions Monday , the Islamic Republic appeared to tell its supporters that it still intends to bring America to its knees.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump is insane, and he can't do anything to us because we have Imam Khamenei, and he is the best person I have ever seen in my life,\" says a chador-clad Mobina Jari, 15, referring to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"People are gathering here to confront America,\" says Mullah Mohammed, who declines to disclose his full name for security reasons. The blue-eyed cleric stands with his back against a wall, as protesters carrying banners and effigies of Trump -- portrayed as a woman, an infant and, in one case, a turkey -- stream past. \"The American people are different from the state. The Great Satan is the government.\n\n\"It's true that (the sanctions) create pressure for our innocent people, but our people are so resistant that they will pass these hardships.\"\n\nOn Monday, the US reimposed all sanctions against Iran that had been lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement, with some temporary exemptions. President Trump said Sunday they were \"the strongest sanctions that our country has ever issued.\"\n\nAfter primarily targeting Iran's automotive and aviation industries with penalties this August, the November 5 sanctions hit Iran's oil and gas sector , its shipping industry and its banks. The ultimate goal of the measures, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is to bring Iran's oil exports to \"zero.\"\n\nTrump has said he hopes the chokehold will force Iran's government to renegotiate its 2015 nuclear deal, which relieved Iran of international sanctions in exchange for halting the country's uranium enrichment. The multilateral agreement was struck with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani who has thrown his weight into keeping the accord afloat by rallying other governments party to the deal.\n\nDespite the US State Department's repeated certifications that Iran was abiding by its end of the deal, the Trump administration withdrew from the accord in May 2015. Trump described it as a \"horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.\"\n\nThe move spurred an exodus of international companies, including European giants Total and Airbus, from Iran. The value of Iran's Riyal plummeted by around 70%, and inflation has spiraled.\n\nThe anti-American protest participants are considered to be from the government's hardline base.\n\nThough no stranger to sanctions, Iran will deal with penalties of a slightly different flavor this time. Unlike the 2012 multilateral sanctions that targeted the administration of former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over its uranium enrichment program, Trump's goals are more ambiguous.\n\n\"Back (in 2012) there was a deal which was on the horizon, and there was a ramp off for all sides in a face-saving manner,\" says Mohammed Ali Shabani, Iran Pulse Editor at Al-Monitor media website.\n\n\"This time the deal which was reached has been abrogated and the demands of the US go far beyond the nuclear issue to in effect demand total Iranian capitulation,\" Shabani adds.\n\nAn effigy of the US President paraded on the streets of Tehran.\n\nIn recent months, Trump has said he would be willing to hold talks with Iran's leadership \"anytime they want.\" A renegotiation of the deal, he said, would comprehensively tackle Iran's foreign policy, particularly its support of proxy groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nIran's leadership has so far dismissed Trump's overtures. Supreme Leader Khamenei has publicly banned \"any talks\" with the US.\n\n\"Nobody wishes to negotiate with Trump,\" says Mullah Mohammed. \"Trump is useless to negotiate with because he's definitely crazy and he cannot be trusted. Even the Europeans don't trust Trump.\"\n\nA renegotiation of the nuclear deal, according to some analysts, would be an admission of the agreement's failure even as Iran continues to abide by its part of the deal.\n\nSunday marked the 39th anniversary of the hostage crisis at the former US embassy in Tehran, and Monday sees the US impose fresh sanctions on the country.\n\n\"I think a lot of people understand that Rouhani's government is either not responsible (for the sanctions) or has a minor share of responsibility,\" says Iranian analyst Hamid Mousavi. \"Iran has stayed in the nuclear deal even after the United States decided to withdraw, so a lot of Iranians don't really see how they can fix this and they're seeing Donald Trump as being responsible.\"\n\nWith no clear response to the sanctions, Iran appears willing to weather the storm, banking on an imminent change in American leadership. \"It is difficult to see ordinary Iranians as well as the leadership be willing to abandon their entire foreign policy for the sake of a US president who may be gone in two years,\" says Shabani.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"resistance economy\" -- a term coined by Khamenei -- is seeing a resurgence. The idea regards Iranian subsistence as a cornerstone of economic policy, allowing it to flout Western demands. Iran's leadership has been bandying the term about again in recent months.\n\nA shifting political landscape\n\nBut amid widespread scorn for Trump's policies, popular support for the Iranian government also appears to be thinning. Government-sponsored rallies are dwindling in numbers, and the hardline base appears to comprise an increasingly older crowd, a demographic out of tandem with Iran's overwhelmingly young population.\n\nThis January, Iran was rocked by country-wide youth protests. The demonstrators were largely working class, a group typically considered the bedrock of the government's conservative base. Many tore down posters of Iran's clerical leadership. The protests were quelled within weeks but dealt a blow to the government's confidence in its broad-based support.\n\nWomen protesting Iran's compulsory headscarf have cropped up in town squares on almost a monthly basis this year, defying a police sweep of the female protesters. At Friday prayers in the University of Tehran, where the government's Ayatollahs and military chiefs deliver weekly sermons to supporters, the crowd has become smaller and older over the years.\n\nOne woman in Tehran's relatively affluent Tajrish square walks to a CNN crew volunteering to speak on camera. She says she predicts that the sanctions-ridden economy will remain in dire straits for \"as long as the mullahs are in power,\" referring to Iran's ruling clergy.\n\nPedestrians look at currency exchange rates in the window of a store in Tehran on Saturday.\n\n\"They must go. Believe me. Because we have no freedom, no work to do for our educated people,\" says the woman, who asked only to be identified as \"an Iranian citizen.\"\n\nNearby, 26-year-old Samin Dodangeh prefers to roll her headscarf into the shape of a hat, barely skirting the mandatory head-cover rule. She works as a waitress at a coffee shop while pursuing a master of fine arts degree at the University of Tehran.\n\nBut since Trump announced his withdrawal from the nuclear deal, the materials she needs have become unaffordable. \"I cannot paint anymore,\" she declares.\n\nThe situation, she says, has gone from bad to worse, and she adds that she would support taking up Trump's invitation to talks.\n\n\"People will be happy if there are negotiations. Why wouldn't they be happy?\" says Dodangeh. \"Look, I can't afford renting a place. I can't afford buying a place. I can't afford buying accessories anymore. I can't afford anything. I have to work more and more and I can pay for less. That's just sad.\"\n\nHomemakers Maryam Golestani, 44, and Maryam Karami, 48, agree that negotiations offer a way out of their predicament.\n\n\"I very, very much fear the sanctions. I'm most worried about the younger generation and their jobs,\" says Karami.\n\n\"The governments should negotiate. There should be real commitment and negotiations from both sides, and they should be committed so that we Iranians are not made to suffer,\" says Golestani.", "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.", "(CNN) \u2014 For once, it's an opportunity to sleep with the fishes that doesn't mean you end up like a character in a mob movie.\n\nThe Conrad Maldives Rangali Island has opened the world's first-ever underwater hotel residence.\n\nMore than just a room or a suite (this is the Maldives, after all, so luxury is the name of the game), the two-story villa is set more than 16 feet below the Indian Ocean.

Rush Limbaugh will also be there, the campaign said, promising \"special guest appearances\" by both men at the rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.\n\nMonday's rally plan reaffirms how the Trump White House and parts of the conservative media ecosystem have effectively merged . Many Trump fans have cheered this development, but it opens up Hannity and Limbaugh to criticism. After all, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow was never a \"special guest\" at a Barack Obama speech. Fox's Bill O'Reilly was never a \"special guest\" at a George W. Bush event.\n\nSo it's quite a sight to see a Trump press release promoting TV and radio stars as his \"special guests.\"\n\nHannity is not a journalist, but he works at a hugely popular network with \"News\" in its name, alongside staffers who have to follow policies that forbid this type of political involvement.\n\nPerhaps that's why Fox News reacted to the press release by saying that Hannity is not sponsoring the rally or campaigning for Trump.\n\nA Fox spokeswoman said that Hannity will host his 9 p.m. show from the rally site, and he will interview Trump there.\n\nThe White House's communications team, led by former Fox News co-president Bill Shine , set up a similar on-site interview in Las Vegas in September. Trump arrived at the arena, walked up to Hannity's stage for a live chat, then began his rally. It was a made for prime time package, and Monday looks similar.\n\nBut the Trump campaign isn't making a distinction between interviewing the president and showing up at the rally as a \"special guest.\" The campaign's website encourages people to sign up for tickets to the event \"w/Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, & Lee Greenwood.\"\n\nIt is unusual to see Limbaugh showing up at a rally like this. The Trump campaign pointed out that Cape Girardeau is Limbaugh's hometown.\n\nTrump's \"willingness to bring them out on the campaign trail highlights once again how little space now exists between the White House and conservative media,\" professor and columnist Nicole Hemmer told CNN.\n\nHemmer, the author of \"Messengers of the Right,\" about the history of conservative media, acknowledged that the merger is not surprising, \"but it is a crucially important characteristic of the Trump administration and the conservative movement more broadly.\"\n\nGiven the midterm trends favoring Democrats, Hemmer said Hannity's and Limbaugh's appearances are \"more a show of solidarity than a celebration of success.\"\n\nHannity and Limbaugh, the kings of conservative talk radio, have been emphasizing GOP get-out-the-vote efforts on their respective shows.\n\nBy going on Hannity's show on the eve of the election, Trump is guaranteed one more chance to speak directly to millions of his most loyal supporters. Hannity averages more than 3 million viewers a night.\n\nIn the past, Fox News has shown reluctance to have its talk show hosts participate in political events, even though some of the hosts openly campaign for the GOP on their shows.\n\nAt the time, Rupert Murdoch said, \"I don't think we should be supporting the Tea Party or any other party.\"\n\nTimes have changed.", "Written by Emmanuelle de Montgazon\n\nEmmanuelle de Montgazon is an independent curator and specialist of Japanese art.\n\nIn Japan, time is not always conceived of in a linear fashion, as it often is in the West. Past, present and future are not distinct realms, and they can instead overlap and shift.\n\nThis conception of time comes to the fore in contemporary art, where many of today's Japanese artists are recreating and developing ancient crafts in their work. As such, \"tradition\" is not a relic of the past but rather a living, constantly evolving idea.\n\nThis attitude toward traditional crafts is one that I have explored in my work as a curator and, most recently, at Asia Now, a boutique art fair in Europe dedicated to contemporary Asian art.\n\nTo coincide with Japonismes 2018, a year of celebrating Franco-Japanese relations across cultural institutions in France, I curated \"The Japanese Platform,\" (with scenography designed by the celebrated Sou Fujimoto Architects), a project exhibiting work by some of the most innovative established and emerging artists working in Japan today.\n\nThree of them -- Fantasista Utamaro, Aya Kawato and Yuken Teruya -- particularly embody this historical approach to craftsmanship in contemporary Japanese art.\n\nFantasista Utamaro references manga and traditional Japanese illustration, though he reimagines them in new and alternative materials. Some of the artist's best-known works have seen him layering acrylic paint and resin into blocks of carefully cut wood to produce bold, cartoon-like images.\n\nWhile the creations reference popular manga, the powerful visual effect is only achieved through the artist's knowledge of lacquering techniques. Utamaro's output is the result of time, concentration and physical labor, and to complete his pieces he must work in stages, gently cleaning each coating and slowly building up the artwork layer by layer.\n\nAya Kawato, meanwhile, employs a similar physicality in her art, though she has taken things one step further by building a custom loom to produce intricate 2D canvases.\n\nAt first glance, her artworks look like pixelated printed images, though they are in fact intricately woven sheets of paper that Kawato has colored in high concentration -- with subtle variations --square by square. Having trained in historic textile techniques at university, Kawato has adapted her practice to produce these mesmerizing optical illusions.\n\nFinally, Yuken Teruya manipulates traditional paper-cutting methods, putting a modern spin on the ancient Japanese art of kirigami (a form of origami whereby the paper is sliced as well as folded). Using unorthodox materials, including legal tender banknotes, McDonald's packaging and Prada shopping bags, Teruya uses a scalpel knife rather than the traditional scissors to achieve a more complex cut that looks almost three-dimensional.\n\nThese three artists exemplify the constant evolution of traditional techniques. And the importance they place on physical labor, skill and craftsmanship is vital to understanding contemporary art in Japan.\n\nA rooted philosophy\n\nJapan is, more than ever, a laboratory of the future. In the West, we see ourselves as inhabiting the Anthropocene -- a world shaped by, and centered on, humankind. We mainly see our future in expanding our territory upwards to the sky and to space. However, in Japan, futurology is rooted to the ground.\n\nFollowing natural disasters like the Kobe earthquake in 1995 (a disaster of such scale that it sent shockwaves through a society forced to recognize its own fragility) and, more recently, man-made disasters like the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011, artists have questioned their daily lives and the ways in which they make art. This has sometimes involved looking back to fundamental beliefs such as animism -- which the huge success of the 1997 anime film \"Princess Mononoke\" attests to --but also a conception of time being non-linear.\n\nToday's Japanese artists have an evident respect for the world they inhabit. Disasters -- natural and man-made -- have reminded them that humans don't dominate or shape the world to the extent that proponents of the Anthropocene might have us believe. They are grounded in a respect for the Earth, and this is evident through the physicality of their art.\n\nThe techniques used by Utamaro, Kawato and Teruya are centered around the human body. Each requires physical skill, labor and the manipulation of materials by hand, a combined focus that I believe is unique to Japanese contemporary art.\n\nBut this physicality is, by no means, a mere tribute to the past. The future is as prominent in their work as tradition is. Japanese artists do not fear new technology, rather they develop existing crafts to incorporate it. Their work is, after all, an expression of humanity.", "Story highlights Bangalore has become one of the foremost IT hubs in India in recent decades\n\nThe city's infrastructure has not kept up with its growth, resulting in big traffic jams\n\nA Japanese development agency plans to install a smart transport system to alleviate congestion\n\n(CNN) It's one of India's top IT hubs, but Bangalore is looking to Japan rather than homegrown talent for a groundbreaking solution to its notorious congestion problem.\n\nTraffic jam volume at major intersections could be slashed by 30% within three years by a new intelligent transportation system (ITS), according to the local authorities.\n\nCameras and sensors will be laced across the city, and GPS devices placed on public buses to enable traffic busters to monitor congestion levels.

Joe Donnelly. \"What have they done with that power?\"\n\n\"Nah, nah, nah, it's not true. They haven't done nothing. They've done something,\" Obama said in response to shouted answers from the crowd. \"They promised they were going to take on corruption in Washington.

His primary duty was to make sure production was up to standard and on time.\n\nDuring the week he would travel to the company's factories and oversee production. On Saturdays, he went to the main office to do paperwork. Even after coming home from work, his job wasn't done: though it wasn't his explicit duty, he'd often spend the evening fielding calls from factory employees, mostly foreign migrant workers who needed help adjusting to life in South Korea.\n\n\"When he first entered the company in 2015, it had about 30 employees. By the time he died, the company had grown to 80 employees but his duties kept increasing,\" Park told CNN.\n\nChae Soo-hong and Park Hyun-suk during happier times. Park initially struggled to find photos of her husband not working.\n\nAs the company took on more work, Chae was expected to take on more and more work himself, to the extent that when he was at home he was so fatigued he spent most of his time sleeping.\n\nChae died around 7 p.m. on a Saturday in August 2017. In the morning, as he prepared to go in to the office, just like every weekend before, he had complained of feeling tired but Park didn't think much of it -- he was always tired.\n\n\"I should have seen the sign that he was feeling ill,\" she said. \"He didn't come home that day.\"\n\nChae's coworkers found him collapsed on the floor of his office. An exact cause of death was never determined.\n\nHe was one of hundreds of people who died in 2017 due to overwork, according to government data. Among OECD countries , South Koreans work more hours per week on average than all but one other country, and almost 50% more than famously industrious Germany.\n\nIn July, the government legislated to reduce the maximum working hours from a staggering 68 per week to 40, with 12 hours of paid overtime, in what President Moon Jae-in said would be an \"important opportunity to move away from a society of overwork and move toward a society of spending time with families.\"\n\n\"The most important thing is that it will be a fundamental solution to protecting the lives and safety of the people by reducing the number of deaths from overwork, industrial accidents and sleep-deprived driving,\" Moon said.\n\nBut for those families who have already paid the cost of overwork, the misery continues -- as does the battle for compensation.\n\np\n\nFighting for compensation\n\nSince Chae died at the office, Park assumed his death would be classified as work-related and be covered by workers' compensation.\n\nShe soon found out this would be far more complicated than first thought. The Korea Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service (COMWEL), a governmental body, required her to prove unequivocally that Chae died on the job.\n\n\"It was a challenge. He (usually) left home at 7am and came home at 10pm but there was no work log showing his working hours,\" Park said.\n\nThe breakthrough came when she discovered that a highway toll booth her husband passed everyday had a surveillance camera with timestamped footage. Even then however, because Chae worked in a different office on Saturdays, she couldn't find footage for that day.\n\nWhile South Korean law does not officially recognize death by overwork, COMWEL regards fatal heart attacks or strokes suffered while working more than 60 hours per week for three months as eligible for workplace death compensation -- funds from which can be a major help to families suddenly left without a breadwinner.\n\nEven without proof of his Saturday hours, Park was able to show that her husband worked well over 180 hours in the weeks leading up to his death, becoming one of the lucky few able to get COMWEL to approve a gwarosa case.\n\nPedestrians cross a road in the Gangnam district of Seoul. South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world.\n\nDeadly obsession\n\nOnce a month since Chae's death, Park and a dozen or so others have gathered in a small classroom a mile south of the Han river near Noryangjin, next to the largest fish market in Seoul. Participants don't have much in common except that they have lost a family member -- typically a father or husband -- to overwork.\n\nKang Min-jung founded the group after her uncle, who had raised her from childhood, died on the job.\n\n\"When he died, I asked why. Why he had to work so much. I decided to study deaths by overwork in Japan,\" she said.\n\nJapan has been studying the phenomenon since the 1980s, as it tried to get to grips with its own fatal work culture, and today is the only country to mandate by law that the government study and attempt to remedy the problem.\n\nWhen she returned to Korea, Kang began organizing meetups for those affected by overwork deaths. This hasn't been easy -- only three people came to the first meeting -- with many unaware of the issue or that they could be entitled to compensation under the country's labor law.\n\nThis blindness to overwork extends to those most at risk of dying on the job, like Chae.\n\n\"He must have thought that working like that was normal. He is part of the baby boomer generation, which emphasizes working hard and doing the duty as the man of the family. He didn't complain and didn't take a break,\" Chae's wife said.\n\n\"Korea is a society that demands overworking. They demand you to work long hours. They think that working long means working well and being productive.\"\n\nOf the 36 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Koreans worked more hours per week on average than any other member state except Mexico and Costa Rica, which is currently applying to join the group.\n\nAs well as literally killing workers, there is little sign these long hours are translating into tangible benefits: data shows South Korea is among the bottom third least productive OECD countries\n\nJUST WATCHED How US workers won the 8-hour day Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How US workers won the 8-hour day 03:04\n\nGradual progress\n\nKim Woo-tark, a labor attorney who attends Kang's meetings and helps families with COMWEL applications, said the overworking culture is a remnant of the Korean War -- the still technically ongoing conflict which has shaped many aspects of South Korean society\n\n\"Because (South) Korea had to quickly get back on its feet after the Korean War, a structure was created that forces each workers to do a great amount,\" Kim said. \"That structure has become a culture, a custom.\"\n\nPresident Moon came to power last year promising to curb working hours and improve conditions. The 52-hour week went into force on July 1 this year, but proper enforcement will not begin until January 2019 and will initially be limited to companies with more than 300 employees.\n\nOne of the first corporations to conform with the law is KT, formerly Korea Telecom. Workers can now see clock-off times on their monitors and managers encourage them to go home rather than work overtime.\n\nKim Jung-jun, who works for the company's public relations department, said that his supervisor will ring a bell every day and announce loudly \"it's time to go home, so finish up your work.\"\n\nIn the three months since the law came into force, Kim said he sleeps more and has more time for family and friends.\n\nThe law has also brought broader benefits to society: the Ministry of Labor announced in August that some 43,000 jobs had been created by the change, as corporations were forced to hire more workers rather than force existing employees to do extra hours.\n\nWorkers for Korea Post sort packages and letters. The company has faced repeated pressure from workers and the government to reduce employee hours on the job.\n\nOrganizing for action\n\nNot every employer has responded so well to the change.\n\nJeong Hak-dong is a postal delivery worker in Ilsan, a satellite city northwest of Seoul. He said that since the new work week came into force, not much has changed.\n\n\"The management talks about the 52-hour policy and how that means we need to start work at 8 a.m. and finish by 6 p.m.,\" he told CNN. \"But the reality is that we are still working past 8 p.m.\"\n\nOn most days, Jeong said he works around 12 hours, \"and even then I don't get to finish the work.\" He said he was worried that as drivers rushed to finish their deliveries faster the risk of traffic accidents could rise.\n\nLast year, a postal worker who was injured in a crash was still asked to come into work. He left a note complaining of inhumane treatment and killed himself\n\nIn July, another worker set himself on fire at his office. His death was followed by two suspected cases of fatal overworking in two months by employees of the same branch.\n\nIn the wake of the deaths, members of the Postal Workers' Union called a relay hunger strike in central Seoul's Gwanghwamun Square, part of a concerted organizing campaign to pressure the government to end the six-day work week and hire additional workers in order to improve working conditions and allow employees to go home on time.\n\nThe Blue House brokered a joint commission in August 2017 between Korea Post, the national service, the Postal Workers' Union and independent experts to look into working conditions within the industry.\n\nAccording to the commission's findings, published this month, nearly 2,000 postal workers were each doing more than 3,000 hours of work per year, upwards of 58 hours per week on average, and the level of workplace stress was worse than that reported by nurses, firefighters or fighter pilots.\n\nFollowing the report, Korea Post agreed to hire an extra thousand workers next year, with another thousand to be hired in 2020. Union members welcomed the result and declared an end to their hunger strike.\n\nPark Hyun-suk still receives her husband's compensation check every month, a welcome form of support but also a painful reminder of his death. She welcomed the changes underway, but can't help wonder that if it came earlier things would have been different for her family.\n\n\"I'm sure it's not just me, and that others who had the same experience are equally haunted by the same guilt,\" she said.\n\n\"If only I recognized the signs. If only I had reacted with more sensitivity, then none of this would have happened. That guilt always hurts. I try to keep living, but that feeling is always at the bottom of my heart.\""]
