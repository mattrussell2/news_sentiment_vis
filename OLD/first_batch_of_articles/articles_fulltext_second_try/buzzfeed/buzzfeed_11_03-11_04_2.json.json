Now scientists believe they may have found the solution: shooting the junk with lasers.\n\nInternational experts will convene in Canberra this week for the 21st International Workshop on Laser Ranging, hosted by the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) and Australia's Space Environment Research Centre (SERC).\n\n\n\nThe primary discussion point will be the launch of a laser program in Australia to shoot space junk with highly-accurate beams from the ground at SERC's Mount Stromlo base in the ACT, moving them out of Earth\u2019s orbit.\n\nSpace debris is really dangerous. It travels at a speed over 28,000 km/h (a bullet travels at 4,500 km/h), meaning that debris as small as a centimetre across can damage or destroy satellites.\n\nThe Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas has a program called AstriaGraph that currently tracks 26,000 objects that range in size from that of a softball to a school bus.\n\nManned spacecraft and GPS and communications satellites are all in danger of collision with space junk.\n\nDr Moriba Jah, an aerospace engineer from the University of Texas, said in a media conference held in Canberra that space junk is a serious cause for concern, particularly as space technology becomes more accessible.\n\n\u201cIf it makes you feel uncomfortable, it should.\u201d The space junk problem is also growing quickly \u201cbecause we have more and more countries participating in space,\u201d said Jah.\n\nDr Ben Greene, the chief executive officer of electro optic systems at SERC, told BuzzFeed News that the aim is to bring the objects back to Earth safely or gently move space debris from one orbit to another.\n\nThe aim of using lasers is not to splice the junk into more pieces, as this would only exacerbate the issue. Instead, the laser beam exerts force on objects in orbit equivalent to four or five times that of sunlight, meaning that rather than shooting objects out of the Earth's orbit or down to Earth, they are nudged progressively over time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like throwing sand at something,\u201d said Greene. \u201cTo de-orbit so it comes all the way down and it burns in the atmosphere, we\u2019d have to engage it with the laser for three minutes about 10 times.\u201d\n\nThis is a laborious process, as the scientists then have to track the object's new orbit on each rotation and ensure that it is not going to collide with something else.\n\n\u201cTypically with those orbits, you only see the objects two times a day, and the rest of the time they're orbiting over the Pacific or America or somewhere else, so it would take a week [for each piece of junk to be pushed out of orbit],\u201d said Greene.\n\nHuman-made objects in space have been collecting in Earth\u2019s orbit since the early \u201960s, and the first recorded fragmentation of a space object was in 1961, when the Ablestar, an American launch vehicle used to propel experimental satellites, became the first object to unintentionally explode.\n\nThe Ablestar explosion created nearly 300 large fragments of debris, increasing the total amount of debris in orbit by 400%. Sixty percent of the Ablestar junk was still in orbit in 2011 because of the high altitude of the explosion.\n\nThe majority of space debris that has amassed since has been created by collisions of spacecraft (both intentional and accidental).\n\nThe most significant contributing event was the 2007 Fengyun-1C destruction, in which China launched an anti-satellite device on a ballistic missile that hurtled towards an old, unsuspecting weather satellite at 16 km/s. The resulting explosion created over 3,000 pieces of junk.\n\nGreene notes that while Australia is not the ideal location for most space programs, due to the lack of high mountain ranges, it does provide the perfect climate for shooting lasers into space, because they work best in a dry air environment (the efficiency of lasers can be affected by atmospheric elements such as water droplets).\n\n\n\nGreene also says that SERC\u2019s tracking technology for space debris is 100 times more accurate than any other agency in the world because of the laser system it developed to locate junk in orbit.\n\n\u201cNowhere else could run a program for debris mitigation because no one else knows where the debris is accurately enough,\u201d said Greene.\n\nSERC\u2019s program to accurately track space junk and build the laser system has been in operation since 2014 and the $200 million laser system will be switched on for the first time in December.\n\nThe laser will only be run at 10% capacity at first but will be in full operation by March 2019, Greene said.

Me and my boyfriend also worked in two different but conjoined restaurants that shared a back dock, where I often talked to his coworkers. Somehow, though, we were never introduced. It was a good thing, though, because during all those times, I was dating somebody else. Finally, a couple of months after I'd broken up with my ex, my current boyfriend came into a different restaurant that I'd started working at and sat at one of my tables. He flirted with me a lot and I hoped so badly that he'd leave his number. I ran back to the table after they'd left and luckily he did! We have been together ever since and are so happy together.

Turns out, this was the WORST DATE I\u2019ve ever had \u2014 with the man being simultaneously boring and rude, bragging about a lawsuit against him, hitting on my friend and then trying to flirt with me again. Then I saw the beautiful man (my current partner) out of the corner of my eye and he looked very familiar. I couldn\u2019t stop staring at him \u2014 both because he was hot and because I was trying to figure out how I knew him. I finally got his attention and asked him if we had met before, and he said that we actually met on Bumble but that I had ghosted him! I was mortified and the fact that I was on another date made it worse. I confessed that I deleted the app because it was too much, not because I wasn\u2019t interested. After that, I tried to run and hide from my awful date. My beautiful partner happened to be taking out the trash at that very moment, got my number, and now we're head over heels and live together!

And finally, this adorable couple who deserve all the happiness in the world: kaydr2 / Via buzzfeed.com \"I\u2019ve always been interested in learning languages, so over the years, I dabbled in American Sign Language (ASL). While working at a bank, the cutest guy used to come in, and when I found out that he was deaf, I made a point to wait on him and use my basic signing skills. My best friend worked at the same company as me and every time he came in I would gush to her about how cute this guy was, how I was going to actually learn ASL for him and we were going to live happily ever after etc. Basically, I had a MAJOR schoolgirl crush, but I was sure that\u2019s all it was. My best friend started to date someone new, and it turned out her new guy was someone I grew up with/went to school with. I knew her new guy mostly because his stepbrother was my first serious boyfriend way back in 9th grade! They\u2019d been dating for about two months and she kept telling me that they wanted to double because her boyfriend had someone in mind for me. Well, when we arrived at the restaurant, I was a nervous wreck from being set up on a blind double date, and who does this mystery man turn out to be, you ask? The cutie from the bank, of course! I was so terrified my head was buried in the menu for the first 25 minutes of dinner, thinking, how were we going to communicate? Eventually, I calmed down and it turned out that he remembered me as \u2018the pretty girl who signed to him\u2019 at the bank! I lucked out that it was a double date because my ASL skills were limited and my best friend\u2019s boyfriend could interpret for us when needed. We went to a bar afterward and as the conversation came more naturally, I discovered that the boys were actually brothers. So I had grown up and gone to school with both his older and younger brother, but never met him because he went to a residential deaf school an hour away instead of our local public school. I couldn\u2019t believe we grew up in the same town and never officially met! I woke up the next day determined to learn as much ASL as quickly as I could and started teaching myself online. Soon he told me I learned more in two weeks than his ex-girlfriend ever did in two years. Almost a year later, I love learning ASL so much that I\u2019m considering becoming an interpreter and we\u2019re moving in together.

I fall into the former. Years ago, I jokingly posted an unflattering, unfiltered picture of my jacket potato with chilli and cheese on top to \u201cbreak up all the pretty food on your timeline\u201d, but since then the meals worthy of recognition on my profile haven\u2019t often been the ones that made me go back for more, but the ones with a garnish that made me go \u201cooooh!\u201d before picking it off. We post photos of burgers as tall as our heads, or of acai bowls that somehow encompass every colour of the rainbow, but the one thing that nobody posts a photo of is their \u201cugly\u201d food. In fact, someone calling your Instagram picture of a meal ugly is a comment embarrassing enough to make you want to delete your account.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when I think of good food, I don\u2019t always think of jewel-red tandoori chicken \u2014 it\u2019s also brown daal and beige aloo paratha. Korean food isn\u2019t just an inviting, colourful bowl of bibimbap; it\u2019s also a bright orange, slightly misshapen kimchi pancake. The food we share online is often less about what we like and more about what we want people to think we like: the flattering idea that you\u2019re someone who goes to food pop-ups to have a taco/burger/hot dog hybrid, or who arranges their fruit into a geometric pattern and wakes up at 6am to have a smoothie and do yoga. But if food is a way of telling people about our lives, so much of the best-tasting stuff is getting cut out of the picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all filter things; I conveniently crop out the burnt-on pasta sauce stains on my cooker when posting a photo of my bakes, and pictures I take inside of restaurants are often only ever of that one floral wall they specifically put there for people to take pictures of. You can be self-conscious about sharing your cooking in case it looks bad even though it tastes great, or about posting a picture of the dinner you had a restaurant if there aren\u2019t enough vibrant colours in it and the lighting is a bit poor. In fact, in the UK, a third of fruit and veg is apparently deemed too ugly to sell. But we\u2019re mammals, and food, even the prettiest food, is fuel, so an apple with shiny peel will lodge between your teeth just like a duller one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut nobody wants to see my crappy food!\u201d If it tasted great, why not share it? Sure, a watery omelette with floating, pale mushrooms might not be something you\u2019d want to post, but a cheesy bolognese bake? A huge pot of really good chilli? I\u2019m probably not the only person to have photographed some fancy brunch that had fake flowers on it, only to pick around the food and then just order a cake instead. When I make my favourite gingerbread cake, I don\u2019t pour over the toffee icing until after I\u2019ve taken some photos, just because I worry the icing makes it look \u201csloppy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re sharing the food that makes up your life online, it\u2019s worth remembering that the breadcrumb-topped mac and cheese you make at home and the completely beige chow mein you eat in front of the TV when you go to your friend\u2019s house are also part of the picture.

We might not ever want to show the \u201cugly\u201d side of our lives on social media, but ugly food is what you eat at home after a crap day, or what you have when catching up with a friend, or what you order at a restaurant you like that hasn\u2019t cottoned on to the \u201cfeature wall\u201d thing yet.

I changed my bio to put that was my job because I want to weed out people who wouldn\u2019t want to date me because of my job \u2014 a lot of insecure men feel like they can\u2019t date an escort.\u201d\n\nOn her profile, Clementine made clear that she was not looking for clients on the app, but her account was still shut down.\n\n\u201cI tried to log in and got an error message of numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked it up on the internet and found it\u2019s the error message you get if you\u2019ve violated the terms of use.\u201d\n\nClementine read the terms and conditions, which said soliciting was banned, but she said: \u201cI clearly wasn\u2019t soliciting.\u201d\n\nAfter she contacted Tinder she received an email back which said she had violated the website\u2019s terms \u2014 but despite going back to the company for further clarification, she received only stock responses, which said she would not be able to open another Tinder account.\n\nClementine said she thinks Tinder may be shutting down sex worker profiles to avoid falling foul of Trump\u2019s SESTA/FOSTA legislation.\n\nIn April, President Donald Trump signed a bill made from a combination of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, and the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, known as FOSTA, which gave law enforcement officials sweeping new powers to go after internet platforms used by traffickers, including making those platforms liable for the content that users publish \u2014 with sex workers reporting devastating consequences.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re an American company and they can be prosecuted because of the anti-trafficking law \u2013 clearly I\u2019m [not] being trafficked,\u201d Clementine said. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe Tinder is just scared,\u201d she added, \u201cbut it\u2019s applied that to my whole profession. If I was a yoga teacher saying I wasn\u2019t looking for yoga clients they would have let me say that.\u201d\n\nTinder declined to answer BuzzFeed News\u2019 questions on these users\u2019 account and whether they had been kicked off the app due to this legislation. Instead, the company pointed to its community guidelines, which prohibit \u201cpromoting or advocating for commercial sexual services, human trafficking or other non-consensual sexual acts\u201d.\n\nClementine told BuzzFeed News that she is a \u201cvery privileged\u201d sex worker, and so wanted to speak up on behalf of those sex workers who regularly experience discrimination and who did not feel able to fight the ban.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m used to getting what I want in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re used to it, but because of my demographic I\u2019m more entitled, so instead of feeling defeated, I\u2019m angry. That\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve started to feel like I can make a difference, and I\u2019m willing to deal with the consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cSex workers should be able to have a normal dating life like everyone else does,\u201d she added. \u201cThe idea that sex with a client is in any way similar to sex with someone you\u2019re in a relationship with is false. This is my job, I put on a show, but it\u2019s my job.\n\n\u201cYou put your body in danger in the military or if you\u2019re a miner \u2014 why is there a stigma around the idea of sex?

The thing is, my skin was fine, save for the occasional spot due to the monthly releasing of an ovum. Despite this elaborate routine, my skin wasn\u2019t very different to when I was a teen and would scrub my skin to oblivion and didn\u2019t know what moisturiser was.\n\nThen, a year ago, I saw a dermatologist for an article, who prescribed me a routine that was made up of much cheaper and far fewer products. I stuck with it, and it worked better than my huge collection of carefully curated serums and tonics. A year later, it still works. Despite not using any sheet masks, clay masks, or expensive serums, my skin still looks great a year later \u2014 except for the few inevitable hormonal spots.\n\nYou know the phrase \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d? Why don\u2019t we ever apply that to our bodies \u2014 especially our skin? And why are we under the impression that our skin is perpetually \u201cflawed\u201d and needs remedies? Why don\u2019t we, collectively, accept the radical idea that maybe we get spots for a reason and we don\u2019t need to spend hundreds on trying to fix something that is actually just our bodies functioning normally?\n\nWomen, the main target audiences and consumers of skincare, are made to believe that if we spend a little more time researching, or a little more money on another product, we will find the perfect combination to unlock the higher level of existence known as \u201cclear skin\u201d. But it doesn\u2019t exist! It\u2019s a lie! Meanwhile, skincare targeted towards men is usually a \u00a36 charcoal face wash aggressively labelled \u201cFOR MEN\u201d, and yet it serves skin no less or more \u201cflawed\u201d than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly this line of thinking that caused me to succumb and buy myself a vitamin C serum. I read so many articles claiming that this is it, this is what my routine was missing: vitamin C, the secret ingredient! Upon reflection, I have no idea what I was actually expecting. I could not really imagine what an improvement would look like; I just assumed there was some improvement to be made.\n\nSomehow we all seem to operate on the idea that skin can look like something other than skin, as if we can get rid of the pores that are integral to it, or disguise the fact that it is something that is in constant motion, stretched and creased into wrinkles. Still, I bought the vitamin C serum and put it on my face tentatively one morning. My face felt warm at first, just a little stinging sensation. Ah, good, I thought, pain means it\u2019s working. Twenty minutes later I saw my reflection \u2014 my skin was bright pink and hot to the touch. I have no idea what vitamin C is even meant to do, but I am pretty sure this wasn\u2019t it. I immediately washed the serum off and thankfully my skin returned to its normal, sallow self.\n\nOur hormones, organs, and entire bodies are in a constant state of flux and every part of us reflects that \u2014 spots serve a function. Sometimes they can be a sign of malfunction \u2014 of hormonal imbalances or other issues \u2014 but a single spot, or several, or a little bit of dryness, or anything that isn\u2019t actually disrupting your life, is not a cause for concern.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: If your skin is generally fine, leave it alone. A spot or two is not a problem. You do not need to spend \u00a350 on a new face mask. It will not fix you. There is no product that will give you clear skin forever, because that is not how organs work. Skincare products are fun, and if you enjoy them (like I do), go ahead. But if you feel exhausted by it all, if the idea of creating a \u201cskincare routine\u201d seems like a chore you have to force yourself to do, please remember: You don\u2019t have to do it at all.

The event takes place in October, during Black History Month, to celebrate Somalinimo (Somali-ness) and it features music, art, language, poetry, and more. This year, BuzzFeed News went to the Final Beats event that marked the end of the festival to ask people there why they think Somali Week is important, and what Somalinimo means to them.\n\n\n\n1. Cherrie, 27, Sweden. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to have spaces and events where the Somali youth and Somali people overall can be connected and get some more knowledge about our culture. It\u2019s so amazing, so I definitely think it\u2019s important.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you? \u201cDefinitely our rich culture, poetry, the music, beautiful words, and resilience.\u201d\n\n2. Umulkhayr Hussein, 23, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\u201cSomali Week is important for the diaspora in the UK particularly, I think, just to bring us together. I think especially being in London, it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t see Somalis, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t really get to engage with each other. ... You don\u2019t get to interact with each other unless it\u2019s your family. \u201cSo having a festival where you can meet so many Somalis in different career paths, so many paths in life, and to just be joined together through music, arts, poetry, playwriting, it\u2019s so important and integral to our community. It enriches our community, especially in London.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you? \u201cSomalinimo to me transcends our culture in Somalia; for us in the diaspora we\u2019ve made our own idea, our own sense of what Somalinimo is to us, and it kind of doesn\u2019t fit the mould that our parents have made for us.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I think Somalinimo to me particularly is unity. It unites us. ... You can go to Scandinavia and see Somalis there and there will be barely any differences between the diaspora there and here.\u201d\n\n3. Amal, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\u201cSomali Week is important because it has all the big names, the new, the old, the writers, songwriters, a lot of people who are experts in Somali arts, that were the firsts. We\u2019ll be able to learn from them, the way they wrote, the work they created. \u201cWe can learn from old and great celebrities; if they were older songs that were remade people will get to learn about it. They\u2019ll remind them of the history. That\u2019s why Somali Week is so important, for the young people to know their culture, to know their arts, and to learn as much as possible from their people. It brings together the older and the younger ones.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you?\n\n\u201cSomalinimo, it\u2019s very important for me. When you\u2019re Somali it\u2019s important to stay close to your people and to learn your culture and everything that comes with it.\u201d\n\n4. Amaal Mohamed, 23, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\u201cI think for me, Somali Week is important because it\u2019s almost like the merging of the older generation with the culture and the younger generation, kinda like putting that together.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo oftentimes for me, the most amount of culture I get is from Somali weddings, but at Somali Week you get not only storytelling but also Somali music, bringing you into that world with the two. There\u2019s no divide between the older and younger generation. \u201cThe other day I went to see Arawelo [a play]; I was learning things about my own folklore and my own history. Sometimes it\u2019s really hard to access because you either have to go on the internet and go find that, it\u2019s not really accessible, and I think Somali Week is amazing for that because you get to just have it given to you and retain the information. It\u2019s been amazing.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you?\n\n\u201cSomalinimo basically means being able to vibe with your people. It\u2019s almost like unity for me and, for example, just being able to support each other. So, for me, coming from a creative background, Somalinimo is being able to produce art that reflects the story of my people, and those people support your work as well.\u201d\n\n5. Hanna Ali, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important? \u201cSomali Week is incredibly important for two reasons: It\u2019s important for Somalis to have a place to go, where they can have a platform to speak, to talk about the things that matter to them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important as a way of showing the rest of the UK, especially London, the ways in which Somalis contribute and the amazing things that they\u2019re doing.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you?\n\n\u201cSomalinimo to me is a lived experience; there\u2019s no way of being able to define it. If you see yourself as Somali, if you see yourself as it being a big part of your identity, then that\u2019s who you are; no one will tell you who you are and who you are not.\u201d\n\n6. Ubah Abdullahi, 18, Sweden. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\u201cFor Somalinimo.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you? \u201cFriendship, love, community. It\u2019s bariis, basto, suqaar, it\u2019s everything.\u201d\n\n7. Amal Nuur, 28, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s a way for us to connect to our culture. To hold on to that little piece of us that we don\u2019t get, and also to showcase that to everyone else, we don\u2019t [always] have that opportunity.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is like the second time I\u2019ve come; I\u2019ve always wanted to come. Last year was the first year. Alhamdulillah, I had an amazing time \u2014 this year I had to make sure I came again.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you?\n\n\u201cSomalinimo to me? Wow, to me it\u2019s my being, it\u2019s my fabric, it\u2019s what makes me me.\u201d\n\n8. Hanad Darwish, 25, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important, especially as someone who is quite young, grew up in the West. To sort of have the basis to reconnect with your culture, and, I mean, it\u2019s one week in the year, but then also it\u2019s a great platform for new artists who are coming through and also to inspire young people who are interested in keeping that connection.\n\n\n\n\u201cObviously growing up here, with the horn and the arts and the culture that comes from Somali tradition anyway, so it\u2019s a good cross between the two. So I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s incredibly important, and I think to have it go to a bigger platform, and also we have artists like Cherrie that are coming along and bringing Somali culture to a wider audience. I feel like as you go on, year on year, you\u2019ll see a lot more non-Somalis coming through to find out about Somali culture.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat is Somalinimo to you?\n\n\u201cTo me, it really means many things, but I think on the basis it\u2019s sort of a sense of brotherhood. I think there are a lot of values attached to Somalinimo \u2014 being a Somali, a family of kinship, I think incredibly kind, charitable, I think of all of those combined.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think being Somali is incredibly fun in one way; it\u2019s a funny community. So I think it\u2019s a lot of things.\u201d\n\n9. Abdullahi Nuur, 18, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\u201cI think Somali Week is important because it connects the diaspora and the older people for the dhaqan [culture]. I think this year has definitely been the most, like, the littest year for sure. Cherrie came; that was the highlight.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you?\n\n\u201cSomalinimo to me is basically dhaqan, that\u2019s basically important. I think that\u2019s Somalinimo to me.\u201d\n\n10. Suhaama Elmi, 22, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important? \u201cI feel like I learn more about Somali people, the Somali culture as a whole. This is the first time for me ever attending Somali week, and it\u2019s been incredible. I learned more about the culture that I didn\u2019t even know. I absolutely loved it.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you?\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know how to put that in a sentence. I don\u2019t know how to describe it other than, like, love; Somalinimo is like love to me. Whenever I see a Somali there\u2019s already that relatability. That connection, like Hooyo [mum] talking about Somali singers and things like that so you already feel like, wow, those are my people.\u201d\n\n11. Mohamed Ali Nur Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important because I think it will unite Somalis, it will bring together the youth, the elders, and I think it will contribute to the unity of Somali people.\u201d\n\nWhat is Somalinimo to you? \u201cSomalinimo is very important to me; I think it\u2019s something that all Somalis should believe in. Somalinimo is something that we should cherish in ourselves, especially Somalis in the diaspora \u2014 the youth should learn about Somalinimo. I think, as I said before, it brings us together.\u201d\n\n12. Hibo Nuura, Somalia. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhat is Somalinimo to you? \u201cSomalinimo to me is like the air we breathe with, the oxygen we breathe in; isn\u2019t that something rich? Isn\u2019t it something that you love? That\u2019s how it\u2019s for me.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Somali people live in five areas: Somaliland, Djibouti, the Somali state [of Ethiopia], federal of Somalia, and the state of Kenya; all five of them are loved.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the Somali community, the five that I mentioned, it will connect them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey will forgive each other, befriend each other, and become one big, meaningful government. They will be self-reliant.\u201d\n\n13. Rahma Jamal, 25, London. Amina Adan for BuzzFeed News\n\nWhy do you think Somali Week is important?\n\n\n\n\u201cI think Somali Week is important because we live in a country that is not ours, so at times we can forget our languages, we can forget our cultures.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeing able to have a week where we come together and share the language, the banter, and the culture is amazing for those that are born here.\u201d What is Somalinimo to you? \u201cTo me, I feel like our people are so unique, especially our banter. So Somalinimo to me means, like, love and hospitality, and just love, sharing love.

Oh, and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication.\n\nWe are living in a golden age of things to drag across your face. There\u2019s the jade roller and the rose quartz roller and the little blade-looking gua sha tools . There\u2019s the dermaroller \u2014 that\u2019s the one covered in needles \u2014 and this sex-toy looking thing and a roller that also zaps your face and costs $600. I initially approached all of these tools with skepticism \u2014 at first glance, they had the same vibe as those old-timey weight loss machines with the vibrating belt. My general reaction to every trend piece and influencer Instagram story about the latest and greatest one was a big ol' \"Sure, Jan.\"\n\nThen five things happened at roughly the same time:\n\n\n\n1. My coworker Gyan said jade rollers are actually pretty legit.\n\n2. I found out that when Meghan Markle was just a lowly actress on Suits, she loved getting intense facial massages at Sanctuary Spa from \u201ccult secret favorite facialist to the stars, Ms. Nichola Joss\u201d (Meghan\u2019s words). These massages supposedly leave your face looking contoured as hell. As Meghan wrote on her now-defunct blog, The Tig:\n\n\u201cTo call it a facial doesn\u2019t really do it justice given that the woman puts plastic gloves on and literally gets her hands all up in your mouth to reshape and massage your face from the inside. Even typing this, I realize how ridiculous (and perhaps gross) it may sound. But here\u2019s the thing \u2014 once you get over the fact that this chic Brit is stretching your face from the inside out (in a slightly painful, but hurts so good kinda way), you realize that she will give you cheekbones like Kerry Washington, a taut chin, and a glow that lasts for seven days. It works. It actually works.\u201d\n\nAgain: SURE, JAN.\n\nBut then...\n\n3. There was a royal wedding that included a lot of close-ups on Meghan Markle\u2019s beautiful freckled face \u2014 a face that appeared, at least to me, to have high cheekbones, a taut chin, and a hell of a glow.\n\n4. A New Yorker article about the dubiously named Face Gym confirmed what Duchess Meghan was saying \u2014 that yeah, this kind of facial massage actually does make you look noticeably different and \u201cbetter.\u201d\n\n5. I found a jade roller that didn\u2019t cost $60; it cost $23 on Amazon \u2014 ergo, I was willing to take a chance on it, so I could find out for myself.\n\nAfter my jade roller arrived, I read the instructions, watched a handful of YouTube videos, and put it in the fridge overnight so I could roll with it cold. The next morning, I still had no idea what to expect from jade rolling. Even after everything I\u2019d read about jade rollers, it still wasn\u2019t clear what was going to happen or how it would happen. But I rolled out of bed, washed my tired face as usual, pressed it dry with a washcloth, and patted a couple drops of my beloved rosehip oil on my skin. Then I took the roller from the fridge, sat down on my bed, and rolled my face in the way the instructions/YouTubers told me to (in an upward/outward motion). It felt exactly like you\u2019d imagine rolling a little smooth stone over your face would feel \u2014 perfectly nice, but not like a massage or anything. I did this for a minute or two and then, feeling pretty sure I\u2019d rolled all the face and jaw that I had to roll, I went back to the bathroom with zero expectations.\n\nReader, it worked.", "Scholastic\n\nN\u00e3o s\u00f3 temos uma protagonista extremamente forte na trilogia dist\u00f3pica de Suzanne Collins, mas tamb\u00e9m temos um relacionamento que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 em conformidade com os padr\u00f5es de g\u00eanero da sociedade.

This product comes a bunch of fun colors, making it as cute as it is functional. Take note of the straps on this bra, as many customers noted it was a bit difficult to fasten for the first time.\n\nPromising review: \"I run half marathons and have DDD boobs and a small frame. I was getting crazy burn marks from other sports bras with underwire. This is amazing. For me, it fits around the ribs (I got the 32E) and the bra band stays in place, doesn't move, really holds my breasts down, and fits comfortably. Everyone that sees it thinks it's such a cute design and the back is cute too. I have one in pink and black. I just bought the one in blue tonight. You also can't beat this price. Highly recommend this sports bra! They're all I wear to workout (I do HIIT, yoga, bootcamp type activities, and train/run half-marathons).\" \u2014jacquelyn Keeley\n\nGet it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in sizes 32A-40E and in five colors)."]
