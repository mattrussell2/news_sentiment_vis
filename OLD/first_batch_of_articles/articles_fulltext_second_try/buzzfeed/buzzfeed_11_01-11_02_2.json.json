This little holder is not that little and it holds A LOT without adding any weight to my bag. I also like that it has two zipper compartments so I can put personal stuff in there without everyone seeing it every time I open the bag.

While you could easily get a store-bought pie, there's something so magically delicious about a homemade one. Besides, making a pie crust from scratch isn't so hard or intimidating if you keep just a few of these easy tips in mind. And if you're feeling inspired, head down to the bottom of the post for the perfect pie crust recipe.\n\n1. Use a hard fat instead of a liquid fat. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed Olive oil, coconut oil, and the like are runny and harder to work with. Stick with cold butter (or margarine, if you're vegan) which will not only give you a flakier crust (extra cold butter will help with that), but is also cheaper and has an unbeatable flavor.\n\n2. ...And opt for butter instead of shortening or a combination of the two. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed Shortening might give you a slightly flakier crust, but it won't taste as good as butter. And while a combination of shortening and butter is also a solid option, the change in flavor or texture is only incremental and honestly not worth the trouble. Just stick with butter \u2014 plain and simple \u2014 for great flavor AND texture.\n\n3. For added richness, use egg yolk in the dough. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed It'll give your pie that extra oomph and unforgettable richness everyone likens with holiday cooking.\n\n4. Rub butter into your flour mixture, instead of blending it in. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed Using your thumbs, rub butter into your dough until it's lumpy. At this point of the dough-making process (before you've added the egg yolk mix), your dough should be pretty ugly and crumbly, instead of smooth and pliable. And that's ideal!\n\n5. Use freezing cold water in your dough to make sure the fats stay cold. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed When making your pie crust dough, make sure to use ice cold water in your egg yolk mix. This will help ensure the fats in the mixture stay cold, and your crust comes out flaky.\n\n6. Wrap your pie crust dough around a rolling pin to safely move it from your kitchen counter and into your pan. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed And be gentle when you place it in the pan so as not to rip it.\n\n7. Use your knuckles to crimp the crust and give it its iconic shape. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed No fancy tools necessary.\n\n8. Use an egg wash to moisture-proof your pie crust. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed It'll also lend the crust a nice, shiny glaze.\n\n9. Tap pie filling on a hard surface to pop bubbles. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed Bubbles aren't a deal-breaker when it comes to delicious pie, but a smooth surface always looks better.\n\n10. For a perfect bake, pop your pie into an extra hot oven, then lower the temperature. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed The instant blast of high heat will set the crimped pie shape and make sure the pie doesn't lose its figure in the baking process.\n\n11. If you're using apple slices, put them in a lemon water bath to keep them from browning between steps. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed A slice of lemon in a water bath will keep your apple slices fresh until the moment you incorporate them into the pie.\n\n12. And let your apples macerate if you don't want a watery apple pie. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed Let apples macerate \u2014 or release moisture \u2014 by placing them in a sugar and salt bath. This will make sure your pie doesn't get juicy or that the apple slices don't shrink in the baking process and collapse the top of your pie.\n\n13. Sprinkle the top crust of your pies with sanding sugar for extra texture. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed It'll give every slice an extra crunch AND shine.\n\n14. Don't forget to cut holes in your fruit pie's top crust. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed Also, so that your pie and hard labor doesn't result in an exploded pie.\n\n15. And for the perfect, clean slice of apple pie, slice yourself a messy, thin one first. Pierce Abernathy / BuzzFeed You'll have cleared room to set your knife down, as well as space for the pie filling to settle into place.\n\nAnd if you want to try your hand at your own homemade pie crust, here's the recipe:\n\nPERFECT PIE CRUST INGREDIENTS 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Pinch of kosher salt 10 tablespoons (1\u00bc sticks) unsalted butter, diced and chilled 2 large egg yolks 4 tablespoons ice water PREPARATION Sift the flour and salt together into a large bowl. Using only your fingertips, pinch the cubes of butter into the flour, breaking up the butter as you go, until no large lumps remain. Shake the bowl to force the large chunks of butter to the surface. If you have warm hands or this is taking too long, you can chill the bowl into the refrigerator for 20 minutes to cool back down--you don\u2019t want this to be greasy at all! Mix the egg yolks and ice water together in a small bowl with a fork until evenly combined. Add the liquid to the flour mixture, reserving \u00bc or so in case you don\u2019t need all of it--you don\u2019t want the pastry to be too wet. Quickly mix everything together with a dinner fork until the dough just starts to come together. Add more liquid to the driest parts of the dough if needed. The dough is ready when it holds together in a ball when squeezed in your palm. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and bring the dough together. You don\u2019t want to overwork the dough, but you need to work it enough that it is a cohesive disc with no real cracks or very dry bits. Wrap the dough disc in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes. The dough can sit in the fridge for up to 4 days, otherwise double wrap in plastic or in a zip top bag and store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Lightly flour your work surface and unwrap a disc of chilled dough. Flour the top of the dough. Using a rolling pin, push down on the dough, giving it a quarter turn every few smushes, to spread the dough evenly and ensure it doesn\u2019t stick to the surface. Start to roll out the dough, continuing to turn. If any cracks form, smush them back together. Roll out the dough to a circle about \u215b-inch thick.\n\nPUMPKIN PIE (ROASTED CAN) Makes 1 10-inch pie INGREDIENTS 1 premade pie crust, rolled out to \u215b-inch thick FILLING 24 ounces unsweetened pumpkin puree 1 teaspoon cinnamon \u215b teaspoon allspice \u215b teaspoon cloves \u00bc teaspoon ginger \u00bc teaspoon nutmeg \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt \u00bd cup granulated sugar \u00bd cup dark brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 large eggs 1 large egg yolk 1\u00bd cups half-and-half Egg, beaten for egg wash PREPARATION Preheat the oven to 350\u02daF (180\u02daC). Gently lay the rolled-out pie crust in a 10-inch pie dish. Trim the excess dough around the sides, tuck the dough under the edge, and crimp the edges using the index finger knuckle on one hand and the thumb and index finger on your other hand. Chill in the refrigerator for 14-20 minutes. Make the filling: Add the pumpkin puree, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and salt to a medium bowl and mix until combined. Spread the pumpkin puree mixture onto a baking sheet in an even layer. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until it looks slightly dried out. Increase the oven temperature to 400\u02daF (200\u02daC). Scrape the puree into a large bowl and add the granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, vanilla, eggs, egg yolk, and half-and-half. Whisk until smooth and well combined. After chilling the crust, crumple a piece of parchment paper, then spread it out in the center of the crust. Add dried chickpeas or baking beans to the center and spread toward the sides of the crust--this will add weight to keep the crust from puffing up and hold up the walls. Bake the crust for 15-20 minutes, until slightly golden and there are no raw doughy spots. Increase the oven temperature to 425\u02daF (220\u02daC). Pour the filling into the prebaked crust. Brush the edges of the crust with egg wash. Bake the pie for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350\u02daF (180\u02daC) and continue to bake for 30-35 minutes more, until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly when shaken. Let cool at room temp for at least 2 hours, or in the fridge overnight. Slice and serve.

Nickelodeon That\u2019s true for some, but anxiety can come in much subtler forms and affect a huge number of people \u2014 especially in stressful times like the one we\u2019re living in. In fact, anxiety \u2014 a general term for a range of conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, panic disorder, social anxiety, and more \u2014 affects an estimated 30% of American adults at some point in their lives, according to data cited by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nBut even though it\u2019s common and highly treatable, the vast majority of anxiety sufferers go without treatment, often times because they don\u2019t even know something\u2019s wrong. Photo by Annie Spratt on Unsplash Anxiety\u2019s tricky like that \u2014 it can creep into your life in ways you might think are just stress, but actually are symptoms of a condition that could be helped by medication, therapy, or even certain lifestyle changes. \u201cAnxiety has a diagnostic set of criteria,\u201d psychologist and trauma specialist Dr. Anjhula Mya Singh Bais tells BuzzFeed. \u201cBut much like anything \u2014 love, heartbreak, depression \u2014 it manifests uniquely at times in individuals.\u201d If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope but aren\u2019t sure why, here are some sneaky anxiety symptoms you might want to look out for so you can start exploring ways to feel better. (Just remember that BuzzFeed posts are for informational purposes only and are no substitute for medical diagnosis, treatment, or professional medical advice.)\n\n1. You\u2019re always busy, but you can never seem to get shit done. You often find yourself running around your apartment, starting a million chores, but you can never get any real work done. Ugh. New York City psychiatrist Dr. Sue Varma tells BuzzFeed that\u2019s because anxiety can often manifest as a lot of \u201cbusiness.\u201d She says, \u201c[You\u2019re] trying to get stuff done, but somehow after an entire day, [you] may have little to show for it. This could also be due to ADD, but poor time management, low productivity [and] difficulty prioritizing can be a sign of worsening anxiety.\u201d\n\n2. You\u2019re deluged by catastrophic existential thoughts. Yes, we\u2019re living in truly nightmarish times, but \u201ccatastrophizing\u201d \u2014 the technical term for thinking obsessively that something is worse than it really is \u2014 can be a sign that you\u2019re actually suffering from an anxiety disorder (rather than just needing a break from the news). Dr. Bais says that thoughts like, What's the point, I can never do this, I'm in trouble, Something is seriously not right, and Do whatever, nothing matters anyway are ones to watch out for, especially if they\u2019re coming in a sequence rather than just as one-offs.\n\nPhoto by Ian Keefe on Unsplash\n\n3. You\u2019re easily startled. Are you feeling excessively jumpy? You should pay attention to those feelings. According to a 2008 study published in the journal Depression and Anxiety, anxiety sufferers can have a heightened startle response, particularly when they\u2019re mentally stressed (*ahem* catastrophizing), which basically means you\u2019re likely to freak out at the slightest stimulation if you\u2019re wrapped up in your own thoughts.\n\n4. Your stomach is upset but your doctor can\u2019t figure out why. You don\u2019t have food poisoning, irritable bowel syndrome, or the stomach flu, so why is your stomach always upside down? Audrey Gruss, founder of the Hope for Depression Research Foundation, tells BuzzFeed that gastrointestinal upset is often linked with anxiety. \u201cPeople often talk about stress manifesting in your stomach, and anxiety works the same,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can worsen symptoms of abdominal cramps and pain and make you feel sick to your stomach.\u201d On top of that, anxiety might also make it harder for you to recover from illnesses that have nothing to do with anxiety. A 2007 study found that for anxious people, having the stomach flu can actually trigger irritable bowel syndrome, a chronic condition with symptoms including stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea, and/or constipation. The study\u2019s authors found that because anxious people have a hard time slowing down and resting when they start to feel sick \u2014 what\u2019s called \u201call-or-nothing behavior\u201d \u2014 a condition like the stomach flu, which usually clears up quickly for non-anxious people who don\u2019t push themselves so hard, can later become a serious, long-term illness.\n\nCarlo107 / Getty Images\n\n5. You\u2019re a perfectionist. Perfectionism doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have an anxiety disorder \u2014 you might just be really attentive to detail and like to do a good job. But if your perfectionism prevents you from trying new things because you\u2019re afraid of failing, or causes you to avoid certain situations or tasks because you don\u2019t want to make a mistake, it might be linked to an anxiety disorder. Feelings of shame, inferiority, and constant self-criticism are all part of that perfectionism package. And, related: a 2017 report noted that perfectionists who have anxiety often reject therapeutic treatment because they perceive it as a sign of failure, which bumps uncomfortably against that nagging fear of making a mistake. Sound like you? Take a deep breath and consider asking for help.\n\n6. Everyone around you is getting on your nerves. We all get into moods where our friends and coworkers drive us up the wall, but feeling like you could go off at any second is another matter. New York City-based psychologist Dr. Lauren Appio tells BuzzFeed that the fight/flight/freeze response is heightened in anxiety sufferers, and, she says, since \u201c\u2018fight\u2019 is another side to our \u2018flight\u2019 response...you may also find that you are more impatient and easily annoyed by others [if you have anxiety].\u201d Dr. Bais says that feelings of rage, hatred, and revenge are common, too.\n\nTommaso79 / Getty Images\n\n7. You cannot make a single goddamn decision. Getting way too emotionally invested in every decision you make can be a manifestation of anxiety, according to Dr. Appio. She says, \u201cEspecially when each option you consider comes with some loss or downside, or someone else will be unhappy no matter what you do, you get stuck bouncing back and forth between your options without taking steps forward.\u201d\n\n8. You keep getting sick and you don\u2019t know why. You don\u2019t work with kids or in a hospital, so why are you sick all the time? Well, feeling rundown, having unexplained aches and pains, and experiencing frequent and chronic colds are all part of the anxiety roller coaster, according to Dr. Varma.\n\nNatalie_board / Getty Images\n\n9. You can\u2019t sleep, and it\u2019s not because you were staring at your phone right before bed. There are lots of reasons it\u2019s hard for us to get a good night\u2019s sleep: blue light from our phones, tablets and laptops, restless pets hogging the bed, irritating upstairs neighbors (seriously, what are they doing up there?!). But according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), anxiety can cause sleeping problems AND new research suggests sleep deprivation can cause an anxiety disorder. Pretty lose-lose. So in order to get a better night\u2019s rest, the ADAA suggests meditating before bed, finding a kind of exercise you enjoy and doing it regularly, and turning your clock away from you \u2014 looking at it in the middle of the night will only exacerbate your anxious feelings.\n\n10. You\u2019re having random chills or hot flashes. You know you\u2019re not getting sick and you don\u2019t have any issues with your hormones, but you\u2019re still having unexplained chills or hot flashes. Coupled with some of the other traits on this list, those symptoms could suggest it\u2019s time to ask your doctor about generalized anxiety disorder. (Also: Isn\u2019t the human body wild?)\n\nKatarzynabialasiewicz / Getty Images\n\n11. You feel like you suck at life. Isn\u2019t this the worst feeling \u2014 thinking you\u2019re a horrible friend, family member, partner, or employee? Ugh. First of all, you\u2019re not. And second, according to Dr. Appio, that feeling of burnout \u2014 like you just can\u2019t do anything right \u2014 may be caused by an anxiety disorder (and doesn\u2019t reflect who you really are).\n\nAnd by the way: This list is for informational purposes and definitely not a substitute for medical diagnosis, treatment, or professional medical advice.

Do you agree?\u201d McClintock asked. \u201cUnfortunately, Mr McClintock, I do not agree,\u201d said Norvill calmly. \u201cHe did.\u201d Norvill, dressed in a white shirt and black suit, with her hair pulled back in a bun, was sitting in the witness box in a large courtroom in Sydney, watched by 13 lawyers; about 15 journalists; tens of onlookers; a judge; and Rush himself, sitting with wife Jane Menelaus at a table about five metres from Norvill, wearing a pale grey suit that matched his trademark curls. McClintock continued: \u201cAnd when you give that answer, you\u2019re lying, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. Norvill looked at the barrister for a long time. The courtroom was silent. And then she turned away from him, to look Justice Michael Wigney square in the face. \u201cYour Honour, I am not lying,\u201d she said. Norvill, an accomplished Australian theatre and TV actor, took the stand on Tuesday morning to testify in the defamation case brought by Rush, a 67-year-old Academy Award winner who has played starring roles in the multi-billion dollar Pirates Of the Caribbean franchise, The King\u2019s Speech, and countless other films, against the publisher of Sydney newspaper the Daily Telegraph. Her court appearance came 11 months to the day after the Telegraph splashed a photograph of Rush across its front cover, accompanied by a blaring, Shakespearean pun: \u201cKING LEER\u201d. The article said Rush had been accused of behaving inappropriately towards an unnamed female cast member during a 2015-16 Sydney Theatre Company (STC) production of the classic play. Rush strenuously denied the allegations, and filed for defamation a week later. Norvill remained anonymous, at least publicly, for months, but was eventually revealed as his accuser in court proceedings. At a late stage, she agreed to testify for the Telegraph, giving it a shot at a defence of truth. She arrived at court before 10am on Tuesday, flanked by her parents, supporters and lawyers. Over the next two days Norvill would answer questions for almost eight hours, which is a long time for someone who is not on trial or being sued. The Telegraph\u2019s barrister, Tom Blackburn SC, asked her: \u201cWould you tell the court what happened?\u201d \u201cI was lying on my back on the floor,\u201d she began. \u201cI had my eyes closed and I remembered hearing titters of laughter ... I opened my eyes and Geoffrey was kneeling over me, and he had both of his hands above my torso and he was gesturing stroking up and down my torso, and gesturing groping, or cupping, above my breasts.\u201d This incident occurred, Norvill said, as the cast rehearsed the final and arguably most important scene of the play, in which King Lear, played by Rush, grieves the death of his daughter Cordelia, played by Norvill. In a video played to the court, Rush staggers onstage with Norvill limp in his arms, crying out \u201cHowl!\u201d in grief four times, before laying her on the floor and lamenting over her body. Norvill told the court, over the course of Tuesday, that Rush traced his hand across the side of her breast in that same scene, as they acted in front of a captive preview audience. In a later performance, she said, he stroked his fingers back and forth across the skin of her lower back as they waited silently out of view, Norvill standing on a chair to facilitate the lift into Rush\u2019s arms before he uttered the first \u201cHowl!\u201d and entered from stage left. In the last week of the show, she told the court, he again began rubbing the small of her back when she said, very softly, \u201cPlease stop that\u201d. She said Rush regularly sexually harassed her in the rehearsal room, making gestures towards her to imitate groping her breasts, or tracing the curve of her hips. She also said he called her \u201cscrumptious\u201d and \u201cyummy\u201d. Rush strongly denied all but one of these accusations, saying he \u201cmight have\u201d described Norvill as \u201cyummy\u201d, a word that \u201chas a spirit to it\u201d.\n\nFederal Court of Australia A stage map, drawn by Norvill, showing the placement of the chair she was standing on when Rush allegedly began to rub her lower back.\n\nBacking Norvill is cast member Mark Winter, 35, who supported parts of her account, with some discrepancies (he says he saw Rush touch her left breast, she says it was her right). Backing Rush is director Neil Armfield, 63, and cast members Robyn Nevin, 76, and Helen Buday, 56, who all said they saw nothing. (Others to take the stand \u2013 ranging from actress Judy Davis to Kath & Kim producer Robyn Kershaw to veteran Hollywood agent Fred Specktor \u2013 testified on Rush\u2019s reputation and/or his career prospects.) One of the first questions Norvill answered was to confirm that, yes, she preferred \u201cactor\u201d over \u201cactress\u201d. In the days before her, Nevin, Buday, and Davis, who is 63, had all opted for the latter. Norvill said she was friends with Nevin, who played the role of The Fool in Lear, but felt Nevin and other cast members had \u201cenabled\u201d Rush's behaviour. \u201cWe\u2019re from different generations,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe we have different ideas about what is culturally appropriate in the workplace.\u201d Norvill blasted what she called a \u201cculture of bullying and harassment\u201d in the King Lear rehearsal room, and the entertainment industry at large. \u201cThere are bullies and sexual predators, and sexual harassment happens in the workplace, and it happens often, and it happened in that room, to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a level of hierarchy that kept that level of fear and silence in place.\u201d Norvill\u2019s voice cracked just once over the eight hours, on Tuesday, when Blackburn asked why she hadn\u2019t invited Rush to her Christmas party at the end of 2015, which he attended regardless. \u201cBecause\u2026\u201d she said, before taking a long pause and starting to cry. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to meet my family. And he wasn\u2019t my friend anymore.\u201d Norvill grabbed a tissue, and the court adjourned for lunch. The next day, the dramatic moment was revisited in cross-examination. Norvill said she had in fact invited Rush as she didn\u2019t want him to feel \u201cleft out\u201d, after people had mentioned the party in a large group. \u201cHe said \u2018I heard about your Christmas party\u2019, I said \u2018Come, yeah, come\u2019,\u201d she said. To further confuse the matter, Rush had said the previous week he didn't think he\u2019d been directly invited. McClintock left the discrepancy to hang in the air. A fair chunk of time was devoted to the word games Norvill and Rush played with their names in sporadic messages they exchanged over the two years leading up to King Lear. The nicknames Norvill gave Rush included \u201cGiddy McHeadrush\u201d, \u201cGenerous De\u2019Gush\u201d and \u201cGalapagos Lusty Thrust\u201d. One of the names she used for herself in a sign off to Rush, \u201cEllen DeJeanerous\u201d, was lost on McClintock. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d he asked. Norvill explained that it was a play on her name, referencing the famous American talk show host Ellen DeGeneres. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t pick up on the rhyme,\u201d McClintock said. \u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d Norvill said pleasantly, as if reassuring a child who had knocked something over. The exchange was so bizarre, and Norvill so deadpan, that it drew laughs. But the humour was fleeting. Moving on to \u201cGalapagos Lusty Thrust\u201d, McClintock said: \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll tell your honour there\u2019s nothing sexual about that?\u201d \u201cIt could be perceived as intellectually flirtatious,\u201d Norvill said. Wigney interjected: \u201cWhat about sexually flirtatious?\u201d \u201cNo. I was not sexually interested in Geoffrey Rush. He has a wife. And he was my friend,\u201d Norvill said. She added, under her breath, \u201cThis is disgusting\u201d. She was also quizzed over an email reply she sent to Rush a few days before closing night, in which she called him \u201cDearest Daddy DeGush\u201d and signed off \u201cxoxo\u201d. Norvill agreed it sounded \u201caffectionate\u201d, but said she had written it while in \u201csurvival mode\u201d. After not saying anything for so long, she said, she was just \u201ctrying to keep it normal\u201d and make it to the end of the show. \u201cI felt trapped by my own silence, I guess,\u201d she said. \u201cNot the kind of email someone in your position would send, is it Miss Norvill?\u201d McClintock asked. \u201cAbsolutely someone who was in my position sent it, because I sent it,\u201d she said sharply.\n\nFederal Court of Australia A photograph from the final scene of the play, in which King Lear grieves his daughter Cordelia.", "Jasmin Nahar / BuzzFeed\n\nThe recipe: This recipe has been shared LOADS of times on Pinterest and has tons of positive reviews.

He claims publisher Nationwide News defamed him in two articles and a poster by painting him as a pervert and a sexual predator who committed sexual assault while acting in King Lear, and by suggesting his conduct was so serious that the STC pledged to never work with him again.\n\n\n\nNationwide News is arguing a defence of truth based on the testimony of Eryn Jean Norvill, who played the role of King Lear's daughter Cordelia in the production and alleges Rush sexually harassed her during the run of the play. She did not participate in the Telegraph's stories and was not named in them.\n\nThe Telegraph launched the shock mid-trial bid to amend its defence on Tuesday morning. A suppression order is currently in place preventing the identification of Witness X.\n\nThe court heard that last Friday, Norvill's lawyer Leon Zwier got in touch with the Nationwide News lawyers and said Witness X \"might be prepared to give evidence\" in the case, prompting the application.\n\nNationwide News barrister Tom Blackburn SC asked Justice Michael Wigney to approve the application, saying the material in the proposed amended defence could be capable of justifying some of the defamatory imputations pleaded by Rush.\n\n\"It is vitally important evidence to resolve a difficult factual dispute between the respondents and the applicants,\" Blackburn said.\n\nWigney said that if he allowed a new defence, he would have to adjourn the case until next April for availability reasons.\n\n\"That further hearing would involve an entire new set of allegations, an entire new set of witnesses, Mr Rush would have to be recalled among other things,\" Wigney said, adding that he was concerned about the impact such an adjournment would have on Rush.\n\nBlackburn said \"strain and stress\" occur in most defamation litigation and that the \"real prejudice\" on Rush is the delay it would cause.\n\n\n\nWigney told Blackburn: \"To say that\u2019s it\u2019s less than desirable is the biggest understatement I have heard in a submission before. This is extraordinary on any view of it. The end of the case. We\u2019d have to run a whole new trial on completely separate matters.\"\n\nKieran Smark SC, representing Rush, said the application \"lies fairly clearly over the line\" and should not be allowed.\n\n\n\n\"When these publications were published, let\u2019s leave aside Witness X for a moment, the respondents hadn\u2019t even secured the cooperation of Miss Norvill ... They didn\u2019t even have reliable hearsay,\" he said.\n\n\"Having published what was a shadow of a story, they now seek permission \u2026 to run what is in substance a new and different case.\"\n\nJustice Wigney has reserved his decision and is expected to hand down a judgement by Tuesday next week.\n\n\n\nEryn Jean Norvill was present in court to hear the application, after giving evidence on Tuesday and Wednesday and being absent on Thursday.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the court heard evidence from Richard Marks, an LA-based entertainment attorney who has been in the business for 40 years.\n\nUnder cross-examination from Rush's barrister Sue Chrysanthou, Marks said that a character actor like Rush \"ages out\" of roles in the same way a leading man like Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford would.\n\n\"When he was cast as the villain pirate [in Pirates of The Caribbean] he was probably in his early 50s,\" Marks said. \"He wouldn\u2019t be cast in that role if he was 80. At some point, just like Harrison Ford, he would age out of that role. Age does play a part in the role any actor plays.\"\n\nMarks, who was testifying as an expert witness for Nationwide News, was questioned over an assertion in his expert report that the articles would have \"no ongoing effect on Mr Rush's ability to obtain acting roles\".\n\n\n\nExpert witnesses testifying for Rush were more pessimistic. His agent Fred Specktor told the court he feared the allegations had damaged Rush's \"psyche\" and marred his ability to work, while LA-based attorney Robin Russell said the association with #MeToo was a risk a film would not take.\n\n\"Right now it\u2019s a big cloud. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\" Russell said.\n\nMarks said he did not believe there would be a \"permanent cloud\" over Rush if he won the case.\n\nAsked if it was true that a movie studio simply would not \"take a risk\" on somebody who had had a #MeToo allegation made against them, he said: \"There may be people who make that decision. I just don\u2019t think it will be the general decision.\n\n\"I believe that this allegation of inappropriate behaviour \u2026 doesn\u2019t overshadow Mr Rush\u2019s achievements and his abilities and he then becomes an actor who is ageing out of roles like any other actor.\"\n\n\n\nHe was also questioned over the amount of material published online about the allegations against Rush and the current court case, and if Rush could truly be vindicated by a court win.\n\n\"Just because a Federal Court exonerates Mr Rush, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone on the world wide web is going to be believe it,\" Chrysanthou said.\n\n\n\n\"People on the world wide web believe the earth is flat, absolutely,\" Marks replied.\n\nWhen Marks finished giving evidence, Justice Michael Wigney said: \"You\u2019ll perhaps forgive me for asking this question, which I don\u2019t mean to make light of your evidence. Has anyone ever said to you before you look and sound exactly like Jack Nicholson?\"\n\n\n\n\"If I had my Ray-Ban sunglasses, which were back at my seat, and put them on, people would ask me for an autograph,\" Marks said.\n\nHe proceeded to walk to the back of the courtroom and put on the Ray-Bans, turning to face the public gallery and then bowing to Wigney before leaving court.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\n", "Looking for even more animals in your life?

Here's a handy guide to help you start posting today", "Almost a third of Australians rent, and that number is growing. But the ability of some renters to make their properties feel like home can be restricted by conditions put on the property by their landlords. There's currently a nationwide movement towards strengthening renters' rights: Victoria passed significant reforms earlier this year, NSW passed more modest reforms, and Queensland and the ACT are thinking about introducing new laws. But the protections in the statute books can be undermined by what the landlord puts in the lease.\n\nHere are 14 weird conditions landlords in Australia have imposed on their tenants.\n\n1. You can't fry food in the house (you may steam food though). Deb Pippen, executive officer at the Tenants\u2019 Union ACT, recently came across an ad for a rental saying tenants wouldn\u2019t be able to fry food inside. \u201cThey were allowed to steam vegetables in the house, and if they wanted to fry they were allowed to use a barbecue outside,\u201d she told BuzzFeed News.\n\n2. You can't \"create chaos\" or have \"noisy parties\". Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF GIPHY / Via giphy.com One lease Pippen has seen stipulated that the tenants couldn't create chaos or have noisy parties. For some landlords, extra lease terms are a way to impose restrictions \u2013 sometimes very specific restrictions \u2013 on what tenants do in the property.\n\n3. You can't have family or friends to stay. Pippen has seen this as an additional lease term, but says these type of restrictions often aren't legal. Each state and territory has minimum guaranteed conditions for renters. That means that landlords and tenants can agree on additional lease terms, but they have to be consistent with those conditions. The ACT has 100 standard lease terms, including that the tenant has \"exclusive possession\" and is entitled to reasonable peace and privacy. Any lease term that takes away from these rights is generally invalid. Martin Barker, a tenants' advocate at Sydney's Inner West Tenants\u2019 Advice and Advocacy Service, told BuzzFeed News it would be rare to have a \"dodgy\" term that would actually be enforceable in a tribunal or a court, even if the tenant has signed to say they agree. So a term like \"don\u2019t place pot plants within 10cm of any carpet in the property\" would not be legal, because it would be inconsistent with the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment of the property, he said.\n\n4. You're responsible for any cost of repairs that occur after you take possession. This appeared in another lease Pippen has seen. It's not legal because it's contrary to the standard terms, which say the landlord is responsible for repairs. But Pippen says that often tenants won't know the law is on their side and might still go along with illegal terms. The problem is that people can \"[take] advantage of tenants not being aware of the strengths of the standard terms and the fact that we have standard terms\".\n\n5. You can have dogs, but they have to be on a leash 24 hours a day. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF GIPHY / Via giphy.com Clauses banning pets from a property are still legal in most of Australia. \"[They] are probably legally OK\", said Barker, citing a lease he saw that prohibited keeping \"fish, insects or other animals\". But even leases that allow pets might add restrictions. In Camden, southwest of Sydney, there's a family living in a rental townhouse. The lease says that the only condition they can have their two dogs in their home is if they are tied up on a leash 24/7. \"There's not a lot of choice for people when they've got animals,\" said Vala Olaaiga of the South West Sydney Tenants' Advice and Advocacy Service, who is advising the family. Olaaiga says often people need to live in a specific location because of their work or for other personal reasons, and it can be difficult to find a property that allows pets at all. In this family's case, their three-year-old son is disabled and the family wants to stay close to his therapist. \"More often than not, the tenants will tell you that because of these [kinds of] reasons, they accept what's dealt to them,\" Olaaiga said. \"[But] how do you keep an animal that is supposed to be running around 24/7 on a leash? I don't know how anyone would actually do that.\" Olaaiga says the landlord in question has a habit of conducting covert inspections from outside the property, and then emailing the family saying that they saw a dog in the yard, and that it needs to be tied up or removed. Now, she says, \"they supervise the dog when they're walking around in their yard and just make sure no-one's looking\".\n\n6. You can't have kids' toys in the yard. The same family bought a small jumping castle when their son's occupational therapist told them that his disability required play time and recommended the purchase. They put it in the yard, but after another covert from the landlord, they received an email saying that they couldn't have kids' toys in the yard. \"That's not legal \u2013 it's a breach of their privacy,\" Olaaiga said. According to Olaaiga, even when tenants have a dodgy term in a lease or the landlord is acting outside the scope of what's allowed, often they won't complain. \"Our experience has been that it's only people who feel like their backs are against the wall\" who take action, she said. \"And even then sometimes they still won't do anything about it because they're too scared to rock the boat.\"\n\n7. There'll be inspections every four weeks. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF GIPHY / Via giphy.com Another lease Pippen saw said that the tenants would have to open their doors for rental inspections every four weeks. This isn't legal: the ACT standard terms say the landlord can inspect the property twice a year. But Barker says that realistically, whether or not something is legal is often beside the point. \"Very few tenants are in a position to bargain with their landlords, particularly given insecurity of tenure and the unaffordability of housing; may not know the term is unlawful and, even if they did, will commonly comply with it because they are reluctant to take tribunal action or risk their occupation of the property,\" Barker said.\n\n8. You can\u2019t change your car tyres on the property. Supplied It wasn\u2019t until Joel Michael, 37, was moving out of the two-bedroom townhouse in Yarraville that he noticed a term in his lease saying he wasn\u2019t allowed to \u201cservice or repair a vehicle\u201d at the property. The clause made an exception for \u201croutine, minor maintenance\u201d, but the lease said that didn\u2019t include changing tyres, batteries or oil. When he saw it, Michael laughed. \u201cHow would they enforce that? How would they know if you\u2019ve had to change a tyre in the garage? \u201cNot being able to change a battery or change a tyre if you\u2019ve got a flat, that\u2019s completely bizarre.\u201d\n\n9. If you unpack a suitcase, you can only do it in the kitchen. Supplied David Maloney, a tenants\u2019 advocate at Sydney\u2019s Eastern Area Tenants Service, recently had a client whose lease for a furnished property in Sydney's Maroubra said that \u201csuitcases must be unpacked from the kitchen and then bagged and tied off in the kitchen\". Suitcases had to be stored in plastic bags and \u201caway from bedrooms\u201d. \u201cIt is also recommended that hand bags, hand luggage and clothing be washed in hot water and ironed,\u201d the lease said. The clause was an apparent attempt to stop the spread of bed bugs: the same term said that \u201c[t]he apartment, bedrooms, beds and mattresses are bed bug free\", and that the tenant would be responsible for treatment costs if there were an outbreak.\n\n10. You have to split the water and gas bills 50/50 with the landlord. Supplied In another case Maloney saw, the landlord lived in a separate dwelling out the back of the rental property. The lease said the owner and tenant would split gas and water bills 50/50. There was just one water meter at the Bondi property. Under NSW law, a landlord can only charge a tenant for water where the rental property is individually metered and there are water saving devices. \u201cBecause they\u2019re sharing the property, the water\u2019s not separately metered, so therefore the landlord\u2019s gotta cop the whole bill,\u201d Maloney said. Maloney says the issue of weird lease terms normally arises where landlords are dealing with the property directly, rather than going through a real estate agent. Most landlords just use the standard lease, but when they start drafting their own \"it gets all fun and games\", he said. Often the strangest leases that come across his desk are from \"repeat offender\" landlords.\n\n11. You can't barbecue. One renter told BuzzFeed News about their lease agreement for a house with a large courtyard in regional NSW's Armidale, which specified that they couldn't store or operate a charcoal or gas barbecue on the premises.\n\n12. You can't use Blu Tack on the walls... Supplied This lease in NSW says that the tenant can't use Blu Tack on the walls without the landlord's consent. Whether or not this is legal is debatable: Pippen says that removable things like Blu Tack should be fine. \"There's no possibility of any damage, they should have no problem with you doing that,\" she said. But if the property has peeling paint, it might be another issue.\n\n13. You can't slide pots and pans onto the stovetop. The same lease says that the tenant can't push pots and pans directly on the cooktop, but must lift pots and pans instead.", "Pick A Bunch Of Puppies And We'll Guess Your Favorite Food\n\nChoose wisely if you want to have the best puppy army in all the land.", "Get all the best Tasty recipes in your inbox!

I use the button's alternate function of turning on/off noise cancellation \u2014 just for fun, to remind me how great this product works. But remember\u2026this technology is not going to isolate voices \u2014 it is designed to remove motor noises (plane, furnace blower, road, engine, etc).\u201d \u2014Claveman\n\n\"Nobody on Amazon owns more Bluetooth headphones than me. This is my 12th pair and I think I've finally found what I'm looking for. I use this pair strictly for my noisy office building. Although you still can hear the subtle, muffled murmurs here and there, it eliminates 80 percent of the background noise when the music goes silent. It drowns out our servers almost completely. The sound quality is nine out of ten. Soft music, pop, and top-40 genre music it handles really well. Dubstep, techno, and electronic music sound great. Heavy metal and death metal are fair. Having it off will give the highest quality, but I have it set to high because of my noisy environment and I\u2019m perfectly OK with it.\u201d \u2014Vader\n\n\u201cThese headphones are amazing! I might have been perfectly satisfied with the first version of the QC35s, but I luckily stumbled on the second generation, which includes the Google Assistant integration. I initially thought it would be a small bonus, but I totally underestimated how powerful and convenient this could be. It's more than just a trigger for voice commands. It's a surprisingly flawless implementation that allows Google Assistant to turn you into a much more productive multitasker.\u201d \u2014Jordan T", "Have you ever gotten your hair done and hated it so much that you IMMEDIATELY wanted to implode after?!", "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

Esse foi o tempo que levou para Lachlan Watson, de 17 anos, obter uma resposta dos produtores de O Mundo Sombrio de Sabrina, da Netflix, ap\u00f3s enviar um v\u00eddeo para a audi\u00e7\u00e3o da s\u00e9rie.\n\n\n\nOs produtores pediram para conversar com Watson pelo Skype depois de verem seu v\u00eddeo, um mon\u00f3logo emocionante sobre um personagem que decide \"sair do arm\u00e1rio\" e revelar que \u00e9 transexual.\n\n\"Eles me perguntaram sobre minha vida, como eu me identificava com o personagem e o que mais eu podia trazer de informa\u00e7\u00e3o para eles em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 identidade de g\u00eanero queer,\" disse Watson.\n\n\n\n(Watson, que usa pronomes neutros, agora se identifica como n\u00e3o-bin\u00e1rio, mas se identificou como \"transexual masculino\" dos 3 aos 15 anos de idade).\n\nDurante a conversa, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, produtor-executivo de Sabrina e de Riverdale, do canal CW, explicou para Watson que o personagem seria um pouco diferente daquele que eles fizeram a audi\u00e7\u00e3o: o personagem come\u00e7aria a s\u00e9rie como uma garota adolescente chamada Susie Putnam, n\u00e3o um garoto chamado Orlando, que foi o personagem original para o qual Watson fez a audi\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\n\u201c[Aguirre-Sacasa] me perguntou se tudo bem para mim o personagem come\u00e7ar como uma garota e se eu poderia interpretar um personagem com identidade feminina, porque eu tinha feito a audi\u00e7\u00e3o para um personagem totalmente diferente\", disse Watson ao BuzzFeed News. \"O nome era diferente; o personagem se identificava como 'ele', n\u00e3o era Susie.\"\n\nWatson aceitou o papel de Susie \u2013 uma das melhores amigas de Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) na s\u00e9rie \u2013 e voou para Vancouver (Canad\u00e1) no dia seguinte para a leitura do roteiro. A primeira temporada de Sabrina imediatamente entrou em produ\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nWatson acredita que suas pr\u00f3prias experi\u00eancias ajudaram a moldar o desenvolvimento da personagem de Susie no programa, mesmo sem ter nenhum controle sobre o roteiro. Por exemplo, Watson diz que o programa n\u00e3o usa r\u00f3tulo nenhum para identificar a personagem de Susie, porque \"Susie ainda est\u00e1 tentando entender quem \u00e9 Susie.\"\n\n\"Eu acho que a forma como eu me expresso quanto \u00e0 minha identidade ajudou [os produtores] a entenderem que r\u00f3tulos n\u00e3o s\u00e3o tudo e que podemos usar melhor nosso tempo focando no papel,\" disse Lachlan.", "Hi there!

Tudo estava tranquilo at\u00e9 que um h\u00f3spede acabou se transformando em um pesadelo. O caso envolveu v\u00e1rias mensagens de ass\u00e9dio e, no fim, houve interven\u00e7\u00e3o da pol\u00edcia. Tudo come\u00e7ou em 11 de outubro, quando o h\u00f3spede, um homem chamado Leonard Jackson, chegou no seu apartamento em Richardson, no Texas (EUA).\n\n\n\nKhawaja contou ao BuzzFeed News que Jackson tinha uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o positiva em seu perfil. O \u00fanico sinal de alerta era que ele queria se certificar de que n\u00e3o havia nenhum outro homem hospedado na casa. \"Ele disse: 'Eu s\u00f3 n\u00e3o consigo me hospedar com outros caras, \u00e9 s\u00f3 isso'\", disse Khawaja ao BuzzFeed News. Ela deu de ombros e seu check-in ocorreu tranquilamente. S\u00f3 mais tarde as coisas ficaram estranhas. Ao voltar para casa depois de deixar Jackson sozinho no apartamento, ela o encontrou limpando a casa. Al\u00e9m disso, o quarto de Khawaja, que estava trancado, havia sido arrombado. Seu arm\u00e1rio havia sido revirado. Todas as fotos de amigos homens que ela tinha no quarto estavam jogadas no lixo. \"Ele negou tudo\", disse Khawaja. \"Eu basicamente o expulsei e ele pediu um reembolso antes de ir embora.\"\n\nI confronted him and he denied everything. I kicked him out and he had the audacity to tell me to refund him. I found out an hour later that he stole cash (around $500) and immediately contacted Airbnb \"Ent\u00e3o, eu coloquei no Airbnb um quarto do meu apartamento. Um h\u00f3spede fez o check in. Tudo estava normal \u2013 mas quando eu voltei para casa o homem estava limpando meu apartamento. Ele tirou a tranca do meu quarto, jogou fora todas as fotos de amigos meus e mexeu no meu closet.\n\n\n\nEu o confrontei e ele negou tudo. Eu o expulsei e ele teve a aud\u00e1cia de pedir um reembolso. Uma hora mais tarde eu descobri que ele roubou dinheiro (cerca de US$500) e imediatamente entrei em contato com o AirBnB\"\n\nPouco depois, ela disse que percebeu que quase US$ 500 em dinheiro tamb\u00e9m haviam desaparecido da casa. Ela ligou para o Departamento de Pol\u00edcia de Richardson. Segundo o sargento Kevin Perlich, naquele mesmo dia foi feito um boletim de ocorr\u00eancia.\n\n\n\nKhawaja contatou tamb\u00e9m o Airbnb. Ela foi informada que o melhor que poderia fazer era preencher um formul\u00e1rio de resolu\u00e7\u00e3o de conflitos. Ent\u00e3o, Jackson come\u00e7ou a mandar mensagens por texto e por meio do aplicativo do Airbnb para ela. \"Leonard come\u00e7ou a me mandar mensagens de texto, dizendo para ir ficar com ele\", disse. Nas imagens fornecidas ao BuzzFeed News, Jackson enviou mensagens a Khawaja do tipo: \"Preciso que voc\u00ea seja minha esposa um dia\". Ele tamb\u00e9m perguntou se ela tinha camisinhas.\n\nThen he started texting me. I ignored him. So he went on to message me on Airbnb \u201cEu liguei para a pol\u00edcia e fiz uma den\u00fancia. A pol\u00edcia teve dificuldade para achar a \u2018ficha limpa\u2019 dele, o que significa que eles n\u00e3o me levaram a s\u00e9rio.\n\n\n\nEnt\u00e3o ele come\u00e7ou a me mandar mensagens. O ignorei. Ent\u00e3o ele come\u00e7ou a me mandar mensagens no Airbnb.\u201d\n\nEle solicitou uma reserva em seu quarto novamente, e ela negou. Quando ela acionou a pol\u00edcia novamente, ouviu que n\u00e3o tinha com o que se preocupar. \"N\u00e3o me ajudaram em nada\", disse Khawaja. Ela tamb\u00e9m voltou a contactar o Airbnb. \"Basicamente me disseram apenas que aquele n\u00e3o era o departamento deles e que entrariam em contato com algu\u00e9m\", disse Khawaja. \"Eles n\u00e3o ajudaram em nada. Em vez disso, tentaram salientar que eu n\u00e3o havia preenchido o formul\u00e1rio corretamente.\"\n\nAlavia Khawaja \u201c\u2013 Ainda estou indo a\u00ed. N\u00e3o tenho para onde ir.

N\u00e3o sou perfeito.\n\n\u2013 Voc\u00ea ainda n\u00e3o admitiu para mim o que fiz. se voc\u00ea for mentir para mim, n\u00e3o estou interessado.\n\n\u2013 Estou te contando a verdade. Eu preciso de dinheiro, mas eu n\u00e3o preciso roubar. Eu trabalho pelo meu.\u201d\n\nPor sugest\u00e3o de uma amiga, ela come\u00e7ou a responder \u00e0s mensagens de texto de Jackson, na esperan\u00e7a de obter uma confiss\u00e3o de roubo que ela pudesse levar \u00e0 pol\u00edcia. A conversa teve uma reviravolta quando Jackson disse que estava a caminho da sua casa. \"Isso me assustou\", disse Khawaja. Ela chamou a pol\u00edcia, mas eles disseram que n\u00e3o fariam nada, a menos que Jackson realmente aparecesse.\n\nSince he told me he was on his way, I called PD again and they said they can\u2019t do anything. And that once I see him I should call 911 \"Quando ele disse que estava vindo aqui, eu liguei para a pol\u00edcia de novo e eles disseram que n\u00e3o podiam fazer nada. E que quando eu visse ele eu deveria ligar para o 190.\"\n\nKhawaja se trancou em seu carro e estacionou em um lugar onde poderia ver a entrada do seu apartamento. Quando Jackson chegou, ela chamou a pol\u00edcia. Perlich confirmou que Jackson foi detido por invas\u00e3o de domic\u00edlio em 20 de outubro. Ele j\u00e1 havia sido detido pela pol\u00edcia de Dallas em 17 de outubro por porte de armas n\u00e3o autorizado e posse de drogas. Em ambas as vezes, Jackson foi levado para a cadeia do condado e liberado sob fian\u00e7a, e nas duas vezes Khawaja n\u00e3o foi informada de que ele havia sido liberado. Ele tamb\u00e9m conseguiu ligar para Khawaja v\u00e1rias vezes da pris\u00e3o.\n\nHe tried calling me four times from jail. Then he messaged me on Airbnb and that\u2019s how I found out that he was out. The police didn\u2019t tell me, they were \u201ctoo busy\u201d \"Assim que ele apareceu, eu liguei para a pol\u00edcia. Ele os detiveram por invas\u00e3o a domic\u00edlio e ele estava com TR\u00caS armas. Eles me asseguraram que ele ficaria na cadeia por um tempo... mas ele foi liberado 24 horas depois.\n\n\n\nEle tentou me ligar quatro vezes da pris\u00e3o. Ent\u00e3o ele me mandou uma mensagem no Airbnb, e foi assim que eu descobri que ele estava solto. A pol\u00edcia n\u00e3o me contou, eles estavam 'muito ocupados'.\"\n\nPerlich disse que seu departamento tem um mandado de pris\u00e3o para Jackson por roubo no momento.\n\nFinalmente, ap\u00f3s entrar em contato com o Airbnb novamente, o perfil de Jackson foi removido da plataforma, quase duas semanas ap\u00f3s Khawaja ter entrado em contato pela primeira vez. \"Eles deveriam ter feito isso h\u00e1 duas semanas, quando entrei em contato pela primeira vez\", disse a anfitri\u00e3.\n\nI told Airbnb all of this. It took them about two weeks to do anything about it. They deleted his profile yesterday. This is trash service. I could\u2019ve been murdered.

E o mais importante, que para sobreviver neste mundo, sendo uma mulher negra, eu precisava prever as piores situa\u00e7\u00f5es e pensar nas melhores estrat\u00e9gias para sair delas. Eu sa\u00ed daquela discuss\u00e3o vencedora, o cara buscou apoio nos homens que o cercavam, n\u00e3o encontrou e foi embora bravo. Mas mesmo que eu parecesse forte, algo dentro de mim estava acontecendo. Mesmo como vencedora moral, de certa forma fiquei triste por ter que passar por toda essa tens\u00e3o em pleno ano novo.\n\nE esse sentimento n\u00e3o seria diferente no resto do ano.\n\n\n\nT\u00ednhamos o carnaval, o BBB, a Copa do Mundo e por fim as elei\u00e7\u00f5es pela frente. Um ano intenso para qualquer pessoa que trabalha com comunica\u00e7\u00e3o e internet, como \u00e9 o nosso caso aqui no BuzzFeed Brasil. E devo confessar: esses momentos em que fica um suspense no ar s\u00e3o os que mais me atraem. Gosto da imprevisibilidade e de como a vida e o mundo pode nos surpreender.\n\nLogo quando a Copa acabou e o clima de divers\u00e3o passou, deu pra sentir que cada vez mais as redes sociais, que tanto nos divertia, \u00e0s vezes era muito t\u00f3xica. E quanto mais nos aproxim\u00e1vamos das elei\u00e7\u00f5es, mais tensas as coisas ficavam. N\u00f3s passamos muito tempo online, esse \u00e9 o nosso trabalho, mas de certa forma isso acaba nos atingindo. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 como receber e cobrir not\u00edcias tristes o tempo todo e passar impune por isso. No dia em que a Marielle foi assassinada, todos n\u00f3s sentimos o baque na mesma intensidade que as nossas timelines demonstravam o seu pesar. A not\u00edcia estava ali, e n\u00e3o havia nada que pud\u00e9ssemos fazer pra reverter o que aconteceu. Uma parte da gente foi junto com a Marielle. Esse era s\u00f3 mais um lembrete do universo de que est\u00e1vamos vivendo um tempo horr\u00edvel.\n\nEu tentei me preparar pra tudo isso, nunca fui de fugir de desafios. Mas eu n\u00e3o tinha total controle sobre o meu corpo e por quest\u00f5es m\u00e9dicas fui afastada do trabalho em outubro, o grande m\u00eas da pol\u00edtica nacional. No come\u00e7o foi dif\u00edcil aceitar que eu abandonaria meus colegas de trabalho no momento em que eles mais precisavam de bra\u00e7os para trabalhar, mas eu precisava de um tempo para me recuperar.\n\nMeu corpo e minha mente n\u00e3o aguentavam tanta informa\u00e7\u00e3o e tens\u00e3o, eu precisava de um tempo para me reconectar comigo mesma e com o mundo. Nos primeiros dias foi dif\u00edcil. Eu sonhava com o trabalho, abria o site do BuzzFeed para ver o que estavam escrevendo e acompanhava tudo em sil\u00eancio. At\u00e9 que percebi que acompanhar intensamente as not\u00edcias n\u00e3o fazia de mim mais politizada ou atualizada. Eu s\u00f3 estava alimentando uma ansiedade e melancolia coletiva que em nada contribuia para o momento que eu estava vivendo. Abrir o Twitter e o Facebook era a primeira coisa que eu fazia quando acordava e a \u00faltima coisa que eu fazia no dia. Quando percebi que eu n\u00e3o estava melhor e que precisaria de mais tempo para me recuperar, decidi desinstalar todos os aplicativos de redes sociais do meu celular e ignorar o que estava acontecendo ao meu redor. O padeiro falava algo das elei\u00e7\u00f5es, eu me fazia de desentendida. O taxista falava sobre o candidato que ele iria votar, eu s\u00f3 assentia com a cabe\u00e7a.\n\nEu n\u00e3o queria mais discutir e brigar, eu queria entender como as pessoas fizeram no passado para sobreviverem a momentos como esse e o que ele poderia nos ensinar. O Brasil e o mundo est\u00e3o em transforma\u00e7\u00e3o e eu precisava entender qual era o meu lugar no meio disso.\n\nAproveitei o tempo livre para me conectar ao passado vendo document\u00e1rios e conhecendo a hist\u00f3ria de l\u00edderes que mudaram o mundo de alguma forma. Afinal, por mais dif\u00edcil que seja o momento que o Brasil est\u00e1 vivendo, coisas piores ou mais dr\u00e1sticas j\u00e1 tinham acontecido no pr\u00f3prio Brasil e em outros lugares do mundo. Percebi que n\u00e3o importava qual fosse o resultado das elei\u00e7\u00f5es presidenciais. Esse era s\u00f3 um cap\u00edtulo de um per\u00edodo muito maior da hist\u00f3ria que estamos vivendo. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 o Brasil tem vivido isso, mas todo o mundo. Al\u00e9m de document\u00e1rios, assisti stand ups de norte-americanos para saber o que pensavam e como agiram no per\u00edodo pr\u00e9 e p\u00f3s elei\u00e7\u00e3o do Donald Trump. Esse era o paralelo mais pr\u00f3ximo e recente que t\u00ednhamos de uma elei\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e3o tensa e dividida. E ent\u00e3o conclui que o segredo \u00e9 encontrar a derrota, mas n\u00e3o se deixar derrotar. E como disse a escritora e poeta Maya Angelou, \u00e0s vezes \"pode ser necess\u00e1rio encontrar a derrota, para que possamos saber quem somos\". E tamb\u00e9m para que a gente saiba o que podemos suportar e o que nos faz cair e milagrosamente levantar para seguir em frente.\n\nPara fechar esse ciclo, fui \u00e0 exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de artes em museus para me conectar de maneira mais abstrata ao que artistas de diferentes lugares do mundo retrataram sobre a vida agora e em outros momentos da Hist\u00f3ria. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \"Hist\u00f3rias Afro-Atl\u00e2nticas\", do Masp e Instituto Tomie Ohtake, foi o que uniu tudo o que eu tinha absorvido nos \u00faltimos dias e deixou mais claro na minha cabe\u00e7a o que eu estava sentindo. Todo per\u00edodo de mudan\u00e7a vem acompanhado de tens\u00e3o. Seja com guerras, revoltas e manifesta\u00e7\u00f5es. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 transforma\u00e7\u00e3o se n\u00e3o h\u00e1 confronto. Pode parecer estranho, mas consegui enxergar que tudo o que estamos vivendo pode resultar em mudan\u00e7as incr\u00edveis no nosso pa\u00eds.\n\nA tens\u00e3o \u00e9 o que nos faz refletir, rever ou fortalecer valores, e pensar em qual mundo queremos para n\u00f3s e para as pessoas que nos rodeiam.

The Kingdom Choir\u2019s performance was viewed by more than 2 billion people around the world who tuned in to watch the culmination of the love story of a British prince who fell in love with a glamorous TV star, and people just could not stop talking about them. With the group dressed in their Sunday best and led by award-winning choir director Karen Gibson, the moment was a springboard into the mainstream that British gospel acts have rarely been afforded and landed them a record deal with Sony Music UK. Speaking at the time, Nicola Tuer, chief operating officer of Sony Music UK, said: \u201cAlong with the rest of the world, we were stunned by their incredible performance at the royal wedding, so we jumped at the chance to sign them. The choir believe in love, music, and power and we are excited to capture this on record for their fans across the globe.\u201d Their debut album, Stand by Me, has now been released and the choir will go on tour next May. More recently, the choir\u2019s royal affiliation presented them with the opportunity to perform at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games Sydney just a day before the album came out. Founded by Prince Harry in 2014, the Invictus Games is an international sporting event for wounded, injured, and ill members of the armed service, whether they\u2019re veterans or still active. Gibson, who formed the choir in 1994, told BuzzFeed News that their big moment came as a result of a past member who has a link to the royal family. \u201cThere was a young lady that used to be in choir about 10 years ago, and she has a good relationship with somebody who works at Clarence House, and this lady was tasked with finding a gospel choir to sing at the royal wedding,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cApparently it was Prince Charles who wanted a choir because apparently he loves gospel choirs.\u201d The overwhelming outpouring of support is something Gibson is still struggling to get her head around. \u201cIt\u2019s partly that people love that sound,\" she said. \u201cAnd maybe it just felt unexpected to see a gospel choir at a royal wedding? Which is something that was new, maybe? Fresh? I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSupplied\n\nGibson, from south London, told BuzzFeed News that the name for the group came to her, almost prophetically, in a dream. She said: \u201cBBC Songs of Praise called me up and said, \u2018We\u2019ve heard of your choir and we\u2019d like them to come and sing at our 35th birthday. So what\u2019s the name of the choir?\u2019 But of course we had no name \u2014 we were the host choir. I went to sleep that night and dreamt of the name the Kingdom Choir.\u201d More than two decades after it was first formed, Gibson noted that the choir has evolved significantly. \u201cIt has changed quite a bit in terms of then and now. I was running the choir up until 2008 and then I went to live in America. After I came back, things kind of stopped for a while, and then I started it up again and most of the people were about half my age because that\u2019s who I was around at the time, and so the sound of the choir has changed.\u201d For the royal wedding, the choir leader brought back past members to achieve a blend between those seasoned voices and the younger new members, to deliver the beautiful tones heard on the day and create the choir in its present form. While the British gospel scene has not enjoyed as much success as its American counterpart, it has produced talent that has consistently chipped away at the fringes of the mainstream for decades, from acts such as Sinai, Rachel Kerr, and Guvna B, so there is no denying its influence. Gibson explained what she believes are the subtle differences between the two countries\u2019 sounds: \u201cI think that with British gospel, there is a nod to American gospel sounds but our voices are not as twangy, not as resonant as Americans, so I think that our sound is quite distinctive. \u201cIt\u2019s got a more guttural, a more earthy sound, I would say. It could be because of our culture, the way we\u2019ve been brought up, how we speak, our sound is quite different. Although having said that, lots of people thought that our choir was American, which surprised me.\u201d\n\n\"Cause I give you all of me. And you give me all, all of you\" \ud83d\udc9c Listen to our version of All of Me by @johnlegend on our new album Stand By Me Here: https://t.co/wg5d0mgpju https://t.co/zA9aw4NpV7\n\nGibson acknowledges that the Kingdom Choir are not the first British gospel act to be signed to a major record label.

Apesar disso, elas funcionam melhor quando conseguem ir al\u00e9m do senso comum sobre um artista ou figura p\u00fablica, encontrando uma parte inexplorada de sua vida e apresentando algo novo sobre eles. E, de certa forma, o subg\u00eanero de filmes sobre figuras queer famosas que nunca sa\u00edram do arm\u00e1rio durante suas carreiras pode contornar o problema da falta de originalidade das cinebiografias com mais facilidade, porque o pr\u00f3prio fato de retratar a sexualidade da estrela confere a eles uma abordagem diferente. Quando surgiu a not\u00edcia de que estava em produ\u00e7\u00e3o uma cinebiografia sobre Freddie Mercury e a banda de rock brit\u00e2nica Queen, alguns cr\u00edticos expressaram preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre como Mercury seria representado. Sacha Baron Cohen, que se interessou em interpretar Mercury em uma vers\u00e3o anterior do projeto, em 2010, desistiu em 2013 porque sentiu que o filme falharia em retratar a partes pol\u00eamicas da vida de Mercury, como suas festas regadas \u00e0 drogas. O diretor original do filme, Bryan Singer, foi demitido no meio da produ\u00e7\u00e3o, em dezembro do ano passado, e substitu\u00eddo por Dexter Fletcher, embora Singer tenha mantido o \u00fanico cr\u00e9dito de dire\u00e7\u00e3o. Ent\u00e3o, ap\u00f3s o lan\u00e7amento do trailer promocional do filme no in\u00edcio deste ano, que enfatizava o relacionamento de Mercury com uma namorada, Mary Austin, os cr\u00edticos imediatamente acusaram o filme de transform\u00e1-lo em h\u00e9tero. Mercury, o vocalista da banda, nunca saiu do arm\u00e1rio para o p\u00fablico em geral ou se rotulou em uma entrevista. Mas agora sabemos que seu \u00faltimo relacionamento rom\u00e2ntico importante foi com um homem, e ele n\u00e3o escondia seus relacionamentos com homens para pessoas pr\u00f3ximas. Sua morte devido a complica\u00e7\u00f5es da Aids, em 1991, quando a doen\u00e7a ainda tinha uma conota\u00e7\u00e3o escandalosa de promiscuidade entre homens gays, o tornou uma dessas celebridades, como Rock Hudson ou Liberace, cuja imagem se tornou, de certa forma, definida por uma trag\u00e9dia queer. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", que estreou este m\u00eas, ap\u00f3s mais de 10 anos no limbo da produ\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9 necessariamente uma transforma\u00e7\u00e3o da vida privada de Mercury em h\u00e9tero nem esconde seu uso de drogas. No entanto, no fim das contas, vende uma vers\u00e3o moralista e higienista de sua vida e m\u00fasica, tornando-o \"respeit\u00e1vel\" para o p\u00fablico tradicional \u2014 tanto pelo que o filme enfatiza quanto pelo que deixa de fora. O filme n\u00e3o nega sua sexualidade, mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o explora as nuances da vida ou da arte de Mercury como um homem queer. Em uma cena inicial reveladora, enquanto a banda est\u00e1 em processo de conseguir seu primeiro grande contrato com uma gravadora, Mercury explica o apelo \u00fanico do grupo a um executivo da gravadora como \"desajustados cantando para desajustados\". Por\u00e9m, na verdade, era Mercury, um homem queer e imigrante, que era o intruso, tanto dentro quanto fora da banda \u2014 e o filme teria sido mais forte se tivesse explorado essas tens\u00f5es. Em vez disso, a mais recente cinebiografia sobre uma celebridade que n\u00e3o assumiu publicamente sua sexualidade durante o auge de sua fama, no fim das contas, serve como uma f\u00e1bula sobre como \u00e9 dif\u00edcil para os filmes tradicionais fazer justi\u00e7a \u00e0s vidas e aos legados queer.\n\nPara entender as limita\u00e7\u00f5es de \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \u00e9 importante entender sua origem. O ex-empres\u00e1rio do Queen, Jim Beach, \u00e9 um dos produtores, e os companheiros de banda Brian May e Roger Taylor foram consultores criativos. Aparentemente, em algum momento, eles aprovaram o roteiro e at\u00e9 ajudaram a decidir quem interpretaria Mercury e quem dirigiria o filme.\n\nComo Sacha Baron Cohen explicou depois que abandonou o projeto, os colegas de banda tinham suas pr\u00f3prias ideias sobre como o projeto deveria funcionar. \u201cUm membro da banda, n\u00e3o vou dizer quem, disse: 'Este \u00e9 um \u00f3timo filme porque tem uma coisa incr\u00edvel que acontece no meio\u2019\u201d, lembrou Baron Cohen. \"Perguntei: 'O que acontece no meio do filme?' Ele respondeu: 'Freddie morre'.\" Baron Cohen percebeu que os companheiros de banda queriam que a segunda parte do filme focasse na jornada do Queen depois de Mercury. Ele, conscientemente, disse a eles: \"Olha, ningu\u00e9m vai assistir a um filme onde o personagem principal morre de Aids e depois voc\u00ea v\u00ea como a banda segue em frente.\" O filme resultante \u2014 sobre o qual o guitarrista Brian May e outros membros da banda afirmam que acabaram tendo pouco controle \u2014 sem d\u00favida \u00e9 centrado em Mercury, mas enquadra sua vida inteiramente dentro da jornada da banda e, assim, deixa muita coisa de fora.\n\nO filme n\u00e3o nega a sexualidade de Mercury, mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o explora as nuances de sua vida ou de sua arte como um homem queer.\n\nO filme come\u00e7a e termina com o famoso show da banda no Live Aid de 1985. O que vemos da vida de Mercury come\u00e7a quando a banda come\u00e7a: Mercury impressiona dois de seus colegas de banda em uma audi\u00e7\u00e3o improvisada depois que o vocalista original a abandona. O que n\u00e3o vemos \u00e9 como ele desenvolveu suas habilidades musicais ou qualquer uma de suas influ\u00eancias. Da forma\u00e7\u00e3o em design, que ajudou Mercury a criar seu personagem de palco, \u00e0 escolha extravagante do nome da banda \u2014 que os outros membros da banda inicialmente n\u00e3o gostaram \u2014, sua vis\u00e3o ajudou a moldar o estilo \u00fanico e al\u00e9m do g\u00eanero que deu \u00e0 banda enorme sucesso mundial. Mas, considerando o quanto a narrativa ignora o desenvolvimento de Mercury fora de sua fam\u00edlia ou da banda (muitas vezes mencionada como sua segunda fam\u00edlia), \u00e9 dif\u00edcil ver ou entender seus pontos de vista. O filme apresenta a escolha de seu nome art\u00edstico, Freddie Mercury, n\u00e3o em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao que isso significa para ele, mas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a como seu pai se sente sobre isso \u2014 como uma rejei\u00e7\u00e3o de seu nome de fam\u00edlia e heran\u00e7a. (Mercury nasceu Farrokh Bulsara, em Zanzibar, no que hoje \u00e9 a Tanz\u00e2nia; o filme muitas vezes o retrata irritado pelo conservadorismo de seus pais imigrantes). E, embora vejamos uma cena r\u00e1pida de Mercury criando o logotipo do Queen em certo momento, n\u00e3o \u00e9 apresentada nenhuma ideia do que o nome significava para ele ou por que ele o escolheu, tirando o fato de ser \"ultrajante\". O crescente sucesso da banda \u00e9 retratado em uma s\u00e9rie de montagens de shows, mas um foco mais espec\u00edfico \u00e9 dedicado \u00e0 grava\u00e7\u00e3o do Queen de \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Mercury escreveu a m\u00fasica, e muitos, incluindo o ex-empres\u00e1rio da banda, especularam que ela falava sobre sua identidade sexual. O que quer que as letras insinuem, a can\u00e7\u00e3o foi um s\u00edmbolo do g\u00eanio vorazmente ecl\u00e9tico de Mercury e um cruzamento espetacularmente estranho de graves e agudos, \u00f3pera e rock. No entanto, no filme, tirando imagens ridiculamente gen\u00e9ricas de Mercury sendo inspirado por uma paisagem natural, nunca conseguimos ver como a m\u00fasica surgiu por meio de suas experi\u00eancias ou o que significou para ele. Em vez disso, h\u00e1 piadas sobre como um dos companheiros de banda parece castrado por causa do qu\u00e3o agudo Mercury o faz cantar. (Durante a cena do \u00faltimo show, quando Mercury canta a m\u00fasica, ele manda um beijo para sua m\u00e3e durante a famosa parte \u201cmama\u201d, outro lembrete de como tudo sobre o desenvolvimento de sua identidade art\u00edstica no filme \u00e9 reduzido ao contexto da banda ou de sua fam\u00edlia.) Ser queer n\u00e3o se resume apenas \u00e0s complexidades de uma vida privada; tamb\u00e9m tem a ver com uma certa sensibilidade ou estilo, principalmente quando se trata de cria\u00e7\u00e3o art\u00edstica. A m\u00fasica e a personalidade de Mercury foram revolucion\u00e1rias, em parte porque evocavam uma est\u00e9tica queer com a qual o pr\u00f3prio filme sugere que seus colegas de banda nem sempre estavam confort\u00e1veis. Por exemplo, eles se recusam a entrar no g\u00eanero disco nos anos 70, que era frequentemente rejeitado como um g\u00eanero gay na \u00e9poca, principalmente nos ambientes de rock; os colegas de banda alegam que disco simplesmente \u201cn\u00e3o \u00e9 a cara do Queen\u201d, mas n\u00e3o temos nenhuma ideia do que disco significava para Mercury, que \u00e9 mostrado rapidamente sassaricando em boates gays. Conforme Mercury vai se encontrando filme, ele adota um estilo gay masculino de bigode e jeans que ficou conhecido como o look \"macho clone\" nos anos 80. Os membros da banda, consequentemente, fazem coment\u00e1rios depreciativos para ele, como \u201csomos o Queen, n\u00e3o o Village People\u201d. Essa observa\u00e7\u00e3o em particular \u00e9 retratada como uma piada boba, em vez de ser examinada pelo que poderia revelar sobre o relacionamento de Mercury com seus colegas de banda h\u00e9teros, ou o que significava para ele reafirmar esse estilo em p\u00fablico durante um momento t\u00e3o anti-gay. Uma coisa \u00e9 ser extravagantemente al\u00e9m do g\u00eanero no meio do glam rock, outra \u00e9 adotar um estilo espec\u00edfico da subcultura gay.\n\nA m\u00fasica e a personalidade de Mercury foram revolucion\u00e1rias, em parte porque evocavam uma est\u00e9tica queer com a qual o pr\u00f3prio filme sugere que seus colegas de banda nem sempre estavam confort\u00e1veis.\n\nEm contraste, o filme dedica muito tempo ao relacionamento de Mercury com uma namorada, Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). N\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada de errado em enfatizar esse relacionamento, que significou muito para Mercury na vida real. No entanto, essa \u00eanfase se torna problem\u00e1tica quando comparada \u00e0 maneira limitada pela qual seus relacionamentos com homens s\u00e3o retratados. Mercury \u00e9 mostrado pela primeira vez \u00e0 procura de um homem em uma parada de caminh\u00f5es durante uma das suas primeiras turn\u00eas, enquanto fala com Mary ao telefone \u2013 a cena, no entanto, se concentra no que isso significa em termos de sofrimento para sua namorada. Depois, ele aparentemente \u00e9 iniciado na sexualidade gay pelo predat\u00f3rio Paul Prenter, um ex-empres\u00e1rio que o apalpa e o beija \u00e0 for\u00e7a. Como escrito no filme, Prenter \u00e9 quase um vil\u00e3o cl\u00e1ssico, que encoraja a queda de Mercury nas drogas e boates. (O filme apresenta Mercury como algu\u00e9m que se descobre ap\u00f3s adulto, mas um bi\u00f3grafo ressalta que at\u00e9 seus colegas de escola sabiam que ele era \"homossexual\" desde crian\u00e7a.) O filme apresenta o uso de drogas e a sexualidade de Mercury como entrela\u00e7ados, e enquadra ambos de forma moralista \u2014 como resultados da m\u00e1 influ\u00eancia de Prenter \u2014, como se Mercury n\u00e3o tivesse prazer nem mesmo fontes de inspira\u00e7\u00e3o art\u00edstica com suas experi\u00eancias e na comunidade queer. Por outro lado, por exemplo, a namorada Mary \u00e9 mostrada encorajando seu interesse pela moda andr\u00f3gina desde o in\u00edcio. Mercury deixando a banda para projetos solo \u00e9 retratado como um grande momento, mas apresentado como uma a\u00e7\u00e3o ego\u00edsta causada pela influ\u00eancia de Prenter \u2014 em vez de, por exemplo, pela frustra\u00e7\u00e3o com seus colegas de banda h\u00e9teros, ou porque se considerava um artista s\u00e9rio com suas pr\u00f3prias mensagens. Por fim, Mercury \u00e9 \"resgatado\" dessa vida de drogas, sexo, libertinagem e influ\u00eancia de Prenter, e volta com a banda, por meio da namorada Mary, rumo ao final do filme. Rami Malek, o ator h\u00e9tero que interpreta Mercury, defendeu a decis\u00e3o do filme de n\u00e3o focar no que ele chamou de aspectos \"mais sombrios\" da vida de Mercury. \u201cFazer um filme sobre alguns aspectos de sua vida que eram mais sombrios e mais s\u00f3rdidos do que os que quero celebrar n\u00e3o vale a pena para mim, nem para o p\u00fablico, na minha opini\u00e3o.\u201d Mas n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada inerentemente sombrio na hist\u00f3ria de Mercury, e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 necessidade de \u201cproteger\u201d as representa\u00e7\u00f5es de homens queer das drogas e da sexualidade, ou retrat\u00e1-los como anjos ou v\u00edtimas (seduzidos por outros vil\u00f5es gays ruins). O diretor h\u00e9tero de um document\u00e1rio recente sobre Alexander McQueen teve uma vis\u00e3o semelhantemente moralista em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s experi\u00eancias do designer com as drogas, sua sexualidade e seu diagn\u00f3stico como HIV positivo. \"Sabe, h\u00e1 muitos elementos sombrios na vida de [McQueen]\", explicou ele. \"Quer\u00edamos mencion\u00e1-los e n\u00e3o quer\u00edamos encobri-los, mas nunca quisemos focar naquilo que achamos que seria vulgar.\" Esse filme aborda as explora\u00e7\u00f5es de McQueen com drogas e sexo de uma maneira superficial, sem explor\u00e1-las como uma fonte de descoberta, e tamb\u00e9m ignora o que seu diagn\u00f3stico de HIV significava para ele. Tanto \"McQueen\" quanto \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" parecem estar presos em um momento em que a crise da Aids foi superficialmente entendida como uma trag\u00e9dia que surgiu de homens gays com um estilo de vida \"s\u00f3rdido\", em vez de como resultado do preconceito anti-gay e da neglig\u00eancia governamental diante de uma crise de sa\u00fade p\u00fablica. O \u00faltimo parceiro de Mercury, Jim Hutton, participa de duas cenas no filme \u2014 dando serm\u00f5es para Mercury durante sua \u00e9poca de drogas e boates, e depois aparecendo em sua porta antes do show final no Live Aid \u2014 no que parece uma tentativa de redimir o lado queer de Mercury com um parceiro \"respeit\u00e1vel\". Quando Mercury \u00e9 diagnosticado com HIV, perto do final de \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", ele aceita seu destino com sua mal\u00edcia habitual, dizendo \u00e0 banda que n\u00e3o quer ser um garoto-propaganda ou uma hist\u00f3ria de alerta sobre a Aids. No entanto, quando ele sai do hospital ap\u00f3s seu diagn\u00f3stico, uma luz branca o envolve, como se ele se tornasse um tipo de anjo martirizado, pronto para o que \u00e9 retratado como seu cl\u00edmax no show do Live Aid de 1985 com o Queen. (O diagn\u00f3stico dele, na verdade, veio depois daquele show, mas \u00e9 antecipado para se encaixar na hist\u00f3ria da banda.) Quer esse tenha sido ou n\u00e3o o auge na vida do pr\u00f3prio Mercury, o filme faz dele um momento de falsa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o. Ele subitamente sai do arm\u00e1rio para seus pais antes do show, apesar de, segundo sua m\u00e3e, ele nunca ter feito isso na vida real. \u00c9 quase como se o filme tivesse medo de deixar o p\u00fablico desconfort\u00e1vel com a realidade da dor queer, e como se, do come\u00e7o ao fim, a vida de Mercury fosse mais significativa em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao que ele significava para sua fam\u00edlia e para a banda, em vez do que significava para si mesmo.", "Here's how it works: hims has you fill out a questionnaire about whatever ailment you're facing then connects you with a doctor.

It's a cafe and wine bar in Aberfeldie, northwest Melbourne. Most people just call it \"Calmer\".\n\nThis is Calmer's staff at the Christmas party. Tara Conron, the owner, is third from the left in the back row. She's run the business for almost 10 years and says she's \"put a lot of hard work into building it up\".\n\nConron's business has been bombarded with bad reviews from teens this week, for reasons that have nothing to do with Calmer...\n\nIt's actually because of their high school exams, the VCE.\n\nThen they showed her a VCE English exam. In the argument and persuasive language section, the students had to analyse a review of an imaginary business called \"Calmer Coffee\" in \"Benmore Village\".\n\nEarlier this week, Conron says some of her regular customers, who were students from local schools, came into her cafe. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, I've seen all the bad reviews that everyone's putting online,\" Conron says they told her. \"It's about the exam question.\"\n\nIn the exam paper, fictional cafe reviewer Jonty Jenkins described Calmer Coffee as \"another example of an ever-creeping shift toward soulless franchises that can be found in airports around the world\". He also complained about a staff member with a man bun.\n\nTo make matters worse, the manager of the real-life Calmer, Elise Jenkins, shares a surname with the fictional Jonty.\n\nSo, because it's 2018, the students went online after their exam, found the real-life Calmer and started giving it one-star reviews.\n\n\"We were getting prank messages and phone calls. Like on the Facebook page kids were asking how much it costs to buy their ATAR back, and I'm just going 'whaaaaaat'.\n\nConron told BuzzFeed News that \"the bad reviews started making sense\". And \"they just kept coming in and coming in.\"\n\n\"Of course they're going to jump online and do this. It's 2018.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the VCAA said in a statement it \"had checked and confirmed that there was no registered business with the name 'Calmer Coffee'.\"\n\n\"It's disgusting,\" she said. \"It would have taken two seconds to do their homework. If they googled it then they'd know \u2014 it would come straight up with our cafe.\"\n\nConron says she has \"absolutely no faith\" in the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA), which wrote the exam.\n\n\"I just don't need this shit right now,\" Conron said. \"It's so unfair. And it could have been easily avoided.\"\n\n\"It went viral and it seems to have worked a little bit,\" Conron said. No Year 12s have claimed their free coffee, but people have mentioned it in the cafe.\n\nAnd since the bad review started piling up, other students have come to defend Calmer's reputation, posting their own five-star reviews.\n\nConron has gone to a lawyer to figure out her legal options. \"I won't know how much damage it's done until down the track,\" she said.\n\n\"All I know is it's a headache for me and I don't need this,\" she said.\n\nShe also says she hasn't really heard from the VCAA, only that they had left a message saying they would come into the cafe today.\n\nThe VCAA spokesperson said: \"The VCAA has been in contact with Calmer Caf\u00e9 management and understands the posts have caused the business considerable effort and inconvenience.\n\n\"The VCAA has apologised for the inadvertent similarity in business names that led to the surge of social media and web posts, and has offered its assistance to have these posts removed as soon as possible.\"", "Share On more Share On more\n\nHannah and Steph as each other\n\nThis post was created by a member of BuzzFeed Community, where anyone can post awesome lists and creations.

It just depends on who you ask.\n\nChristian Democratic Party MP reverend Fred Nile first proposed a bill in 2013 that would make it a crime to harm or destroy a foetus, and he's introduced iterations of the legislation in subsequent years. However two factors might just help Nile get some version of his bill across the line this time. The first is that the state's premier Gladys Berejiklian has indicated she is open to discussions about changing the law so that the state can pursue charges against a person who kills a foetus, following a horrific car crash that claimed the lives of two young women, one of whom was heavily pregnant with twins. The second is that Nationals MP Trevor Khan has drafted a list of amendments to Nile's most recent bill, which he believes could satisfy all parties in this reignited debate over whether or not a foetus is legally a \"person\". So what is foetal personhood? What would this law mean for pregnant women? Would it make abortion harder to access?\n\nLauren Farrow / AAPIMAGE Protesters in opposition of \"Zoe's Law\" bill in Sydney, Thursday, Nov. 21, 2013.\n\nCalled the Crimes Amendment (Zoe\u2019s Law) Bill 2013 (No. 2), Nile's bill was put to a conscience vote in November 2013 and passed through the NSW lower house by 63 votes to 26. However the bill lapsed (no one in the upper house brought it forward) in November 2014. The legislation is named \u201cZoe\u2019s Law\u201d because of Sydney woman Brodie Donegan, who was hit by a drug-affected driver in 2009. Her unborn child, named Zoe, died at 32 weeks. The driver was charged with grievous bodily harm to Donegan, but could not be charged with Zoe\u2019s death. Ahead of the upper house vote in 2014, women's rights groups and legal and medical associations raised concerns about the impact on abortion laws of giving a foetus legal personhood. Donegan has repeatedly said she does not support Nile's bill.\n\nOpen letter to @frednile: you continue to use my daughters name in your laws. I have said many times I do not support this. Please stop now.\n\nSo what exactly does the bill do? You can read it in its entirety here, but it essentially amends the Crimes Act 1900 to establish a separate offence for conduct causing serious harm to, or the destruction of, a \"child in utero\". Why are people angry about it? Adrianne Walters, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said Nile\u2019s bill \u201cturns women\u2019s bodies into battlegrounds\u201d. \u201cIt sets a dangerous precedent,\u201d Walters told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThe foetus is given the status of a person and claims can then be made about its rights and interests by others, which then clash with the rights and interests of the woman.\u201d Walters believes the bill\u2019s passage would further complicate abortion law in NSW, where a woman and her doctor can be convicted for an unlawful abortion. Case law has established that abortion is lawful in NSW if the doctor has an honest opinion that continuing the pregnancy would be seriously harmful to the health of the woman. \u201cWomen in NSW already have the spectre of criminal prosecution hanging over their heads when they seek an abortion, and this could force scared and vulnerable people away from safe healthcare at a time when they need it most, and potentially push them towards unsafe options,\u201d she said. The ramifications might not be limited to abortion, and women could end up in a similar situation to some jurisdictions in the United States, where women were prosecuted over their own miscarriages, Walters said. \u201cFor example, a woman prosecuted for attempting suicide while pregnant, a woman sent to jail for having a miscarriage, women who have had a stillborn child being treated with suspicion and being subjected to inquiries about her pregnancy,\u201d she said. Criminal law in NSW already includes the loss of a foetus as part of the definition of grievous bodily harm, Walters said, and that is \u201cappropriate\u201d. The NSW Bar Association does not support Nile\u2019s bill, based on the broad definition of a \u201cchild in utero\u201d and the potential implications of the legislation, especially for later term abortions. \u201cThe Bar Association has consistently taken the position that the current New South Wales criminal law in this area is satisfactory,\u201d the organisation said in a briefing note on Wednesday.\n\nMick Tsikas / AAP Trevor Khan.\n\nJulie Hamblin, a health law expert and consultant with HWL Ebsworth Lawyers, said the bill clearly states the offence would not apply to medical procedures or to conduct engaged in by or with the consent of the mother of the \u201cchild in utero\u201d. Still, the exemption leaves women and abortion providers in an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d position. \u201c\u2018Child in utero\u2019 is highly emotive and reflects a particular religious position that should have no place in legislation,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is really testing the limits of those definitions, which are very important in the way doctors manage pregnant women.\u201d Why is a pro-choice MP going anywhere near this legislation? Khan, who practiced as a criminal lawyer before he was elected in 2007, said that complainants in car accidents sometimes felt a single charge against someone responsible for ending the life of their foetus did \"not reflect the enormity of their loss\". \"I believe we can actually accommodate their grief without affecting what concerns so many people have in changing the law affecting abortion law reform,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News. Khan, who this year co-sponsored a successful bill to establish 150-metre buffer zones outside abortion clinics to protect patients from harassment, said he would vote against Nile\u2019s bill in its current form. \"I didn't decide to introduce amendments so it would pass, I introduced amendments because I think it is an issue that will be dealt with when abortion law reform is addressed, and you can't simply shut this debate down.\" What is Khan changing about the bill? His first amendment replaces the term \"child in utero\" with \u201cthe foetus of a pregnant woman\u201d. \"The change of the term recognises we are still talking about an injury that is occasioned on the mother, i.e. we are getting as far from a concept of foetal personhood as possible,\" Khan said. The next amendment deletes \"Zoe's Law\" from the name of the bill. \"I haven't spoken to [Brodie Donegan] in some years but when I spoke to her previously there was this feeling that the danger was politicians were taking ownership in a sense of her private grief, and she wasn't entirely comfortable with that,\" Khan said. Khan said Nile's bill applies to a pregnancy \"from conception\", whereas his third amendment sets a gestational limit of 24 weeks. The destruction of a foetus before this gestation would not be captured by the offence. He has also included a section that essentially says if a woman\u2019s foetus is harmed in the course of criminal activity, she could be liable to prosecution. Hamblin finds this part of the amendments \u201cshocking\u201d. \u201cThis opens up this whole issue about culpability of a woman for damage to her foetus,\u201d Hamblin said. \u201cSuppose a pregnant woman assaults someone in the course of a fight and she\u2019s miscarried. 0Or if a woman drink drives and has an accident and miscarries as a result.\u201d Newcastle lawyer Catherine Henry, who represented a woman in a landmark case that became about the criminal status of abortion in NSW, said \"at first blush\" Khan's amendments \"had a lot of promise\", but she was also worried they might police \"maternal conduct\". \"I do think this addresses the issue of foetal personhood to an extent, but it still regulates women's behaviour in a way that isn't appropriate,\" she said. \"You can have a distinct provision that recognises the loss of a foetus maybe in health legislation, but you just can't have this tied up with regulating a woman's behaviour whilst pregnant, or you'll end up with a situation like in the southern states of America.\"", "Yasumi Morito for BuzzFeed

So, when I saw this griddle for sale, I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. This thing is so great that, since I bought one for us three years ago, I have bought two more to give as gifts; it's my go-to housewarming gift. It's on our counter all the time and gets used two to five times a week. The controls are easy to understand, the removable drip-tray is easy to clean, and the ability to pop the grill plates out and put them in the dishwasher means even less work than cooking with a pan on the stove.\" \u2014Matthew\n\nGet it from Amazon for $69.53+ (available with silver or black handles).", "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

He claims publisher Nationwide News defamed him in two articles and a poster by painting him as a pervert and a sexual predator who committed sexual assault while acting in King Lear, and by suggesting his conduct was so serious that the STC pledged to never work with him again.\n\n\n\nNationwide News is arguing a defence of truth based on the testimony of Norvill, who played the role of King Lear's daughter Cordelia in the production. She did not participate in the Telegraph's stories and was not named in them.\n\nMark Winter, who played Edgar in the production, told the court on Thursday morning that during a scene where Rush, as King Lear, was grieving the dead body of his daughter Cordelia, he saw Rush touch Norvill's breast.\n\n\"I saw Geoffrey\u2019s hand cupping around the body of EJ\u2019s [Eryn Jean] breast, which was something I hadn\u2019t seen before on stage,\" he said.\n\n\"The nipple was not covered ... It\u2019s a little bit tricky to describe I guess but I would say the sort of side and under. Not like a squeeze, if you will. Not like that.\"\n\nUnder cross-examination from Rush\u2019s barrister Bruce McClintock SC, Winter was questioned on the specifics of what he had seen.\n\nNorvill testified earlier this week that Rush had touched the right side of her right breast. Winter said his recollection was of seeing Rush\u2019s right hand on Norvill\u2019s left breast.\n\n\"You agreed with me previously that you never saw Mr Rush touch her right breast,\" McClintock said, pointing out the discrepancy.\n\n\"I can say unequivocally his hand touched her breast,\" Winter replied.\n\nHe was also quizzed on whether the audience would have been able to see the alleged touch.\n\n\"Don\u2019t you think it just might ruin the drama and pathos of Lear grieving over his dead daughter?\" asked McClintock.\n\nWinter: \"I found it confusing.\"\n\nMcClintock: \"The audience would find it farcical, wouldn\u2019t they, if they\u2019d seen Mr Rush doing what you described?\"\n\nWinter: \"I can\u2019t comment on the audience, I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nMcClintock: \"You see, what you\u2019ve described never ever happened, did it Mr Winter?\"\n\nWinter: \"It absolutely did.\"", "Get all the best Tasty recipes in your inbox!
