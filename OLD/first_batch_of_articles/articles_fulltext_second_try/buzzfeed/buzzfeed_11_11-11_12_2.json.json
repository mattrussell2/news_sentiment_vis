You can find more Slumber Party posts here.\n\nMelatonin is a hormone that's naturally produced by our brain's pineal gland. It's also a supplement that a lot of people have started taking when they need help getting to sleep. Solidcolours / Getty Images When produced in the brain, melatonin works to regulate our circadian rhythm, which controls the body's sleep-wake cycle. Basically, it's released at night when the sun goes down to let your body know that it's time for bed. When taken as a supplement (in tablet, gummy, or liquid form), it essentially does the same thing \u2014 sends a message to your brain that it's time for sleep. But there's a lot of other things people should know about melatonin. So, we spoke to Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief of the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, to find out more about the sleep supplement people are seriously obsessed with.\n\n1. Melatonin supplements aren't FDA-regulated. As melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement in the US, it isn't regulated by the FDA like most medications and prescriptions are. According to Czeisler, this means that you can't always trust what the labels on these supplements tell you. In fact, a 2017 study from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that the actual melatonin content of many supplements sold in drugstores widely differed from what was shown on the label. In more than 70% of the supplements tested, the melatonin content didn't fall within a 10% margin of what was listed on the label, and some products even differed by up to 465%.\n\n2. So, if you want to take melatonin supplements, go for pharmaceutical-grade products. Consumer Reports recommends buying melatonin products with the \"USP verified\" mark, which means they've been vetted by the United States Pharmacopeia. Czeisler also suggests opting for products that don't mix other supplements (like valerian root or magnesium, for example) with melatonin, as it's hard to be sure of the effect these combinations may have on your body and on each other.\n\nRobert Nelson / Unsplash\n\n3. Research has found that the correct dose of melatonin is 0.3 milligrams , which is a lot less than what most people are taking. In drugstores, melatonin is usually sold in 1mg, 3mg, 5mg, or 10mg doses. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study also found that higher doses of melatonin were actually less effective at treating insomnia, and left some subjects with a hangover-like feeling the following day.\n\n4. When taking melatonin, it's still important to reduce your exposure to blue light at night. Blue light, which is emitted by screens and bright lightbulbs, suppresses natural melatonin production, tricking the body into thinking the sun is still up. \"We are exposed to so much artificial light between dusk and when we go to bed,\" says Czeisler. \"This exposure to light has pushed a lot of us four time zones westward in terms of our circadian rhythms. So, it might be dark and time for bed, but your brain has no idea and isn't releasing melatonin. A lot of people think they have insomnia, but they've actually just inadvertently shifted their circadian rhythms later, and are therefore unable to sleep.\" Not only do bright lights and screens block your natural melatonin production, they can also neutralize the effect of supplements. If you want the supplement to help you get to sleep, you need to work with it and switch off any harsh lights and put down your phone.\n\nAntgor / Getty Images\n\n5. Melatonin isn't meant to make you sleepy, like a traditional sleep aid might. The only purpose of melatonin is to regulate your sleep-wake cycle. So, while it technically can make you feel sleepy, it's not because the melatonin itself is putting you to sleep like a sleeping tablet or other sleep aid. \"If you take melatonin when you\u2019re already naturally releasing melatonin \u2014 so, during the night when you haven't been exposed to a lot of artificial light \u2014 it has no effect at all,\" says Czeisler.\n\n6. But it's a great way to fight jet lag and adjust to a new time zone. Research has found that melatonin is actually very effective at preventing jet lag and aiding the body to adjust to a different time zone by resetting the body's circadian rhythm.\n\n7. Melatonin supplements should be taken around two hours before bed. According to John Hopkins Medicine, this is the best time to take melatonin. Your natural melatonin levels rise naturally around two hours before your normal bedtime when they're not suppressed by blue light, or confused by a different time zone, so it makes sense that this is the perfect time to give your brain the hormone boost.\n\nDavid-prado / Getty Images", "Check\n\nMet someone with the exact same first and last name as you", "Looking for even more animals in your life?

The Australian government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency has tracked more than 40% of the nation's employees (4.1 million people) to measure the gender composition of the workforce, the remuneration received by men and women, the flexibility of employment terms (especially regarding family or caring responsibilities) and the frequency of sex-based harassment and discrimination. So what is the good news? \"The pay gap this year has seen the biggest single percentage drop ever, by 1.1%,\" the agency's engagement executive manager Kate Lee told BuzzFeed News. Over the five years to March 21 the gender pay gap continued to narrow but men still out-earn women, on average by 21.3%, in every industry, occupation and manager category.\n\nWGEA/Supplied\n\n\"So men are still taking home, on average, 21% more than women, which includes things like bonuses and shift allowances,\" Lee said. \"The pay gap starts for new graduates, so it isn't just women who are starting their families, but it starts as soon as you hit the workforce out of uni.\"\n\nWGEA/Supplied\n\nThe number of organisations with targeted policies or strategies to support gender equality has also gone up, including an increase in the number of employers who have a formal policy or strategy to support employees who are experiencing family or domestic violence. \"The number of employers offering flexible work has gone up, which is an important thing for gender equality for both men and women,\" Lee said.\n\nWGEA/Supplied\n\nWhat is the bad news? Although the proportion of women in management has increased, most senior roles, especially at the CEO level, are still dominated by men. There is almost no improvement this year in the number of women around Australia\u2019s boardroom tables. Just over 35% of the board and governing bodies the agency looked at had no female members. None. The pay gap has also actually increased in some industries, notably construction and health.\n\nWGEA//Supplied\n\n\"The finance sector still has the highest pay gap, but it has gone down every year and in fact down 6% over the past five years, whereas construction has gone up and has almost overtaken finance now,\" Lee said. \"Construction is a male-dominated industry, but the the pay gap is double that of mining which is equally as male-dominated.\" The widening gender pay gap in healthcare was \"concerning\", she said.\n\nWGEA/Supplied\n\n\"You have an industry in which it is 80% women but men are taking home more money.\" What is stagnating? \u201cAccess to parental leave has ground to a halt,\u201d the agency\u2019s director Libby Lyons wrote in the report.\n\nWGEA/Supplied", "Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 tem o app do BuzzFeed Brasil?\n\nBaixe gratuitamente no Android e no iOS para ver todos os nossos testes, v\u00eddeos, not\u00edcias e muito buzz.", "#MichelleObama opens up about early marriage struggles with #BarackObama: \"He\u2019s a plate spinner and it\u2019s not exciting unless one\u2019s about to fall.

That decision was upheld by the Federal Court in May.\n\nIn 2017 Hands\u2019 visa was cancelled after pleading guilty and being sentenced to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for a number of offences, including intimidating his partner and assaulting her grandson.

He has lived and worked in Aboriginal communities on the NSW South Coast since.\n\nThe Australian government\u2019s decision to deport a man who has spent most of his life in Aboriginal communities did not properly take into account his identification as an Aboriginal man, the Federal Court has heard this morning.\n\nIn his application for his visa cancellation to be reversed, Hands referred to his Aboriginal partner of 12 years, Maria Walker, his four Aboriginal children from previous relationships, and the fact that he was helping Walker raise five grandchildren, who recognised him as their \"Pop\".\n\nA statutory declaration from Walker attested that he was raised \u201cwithin the Koori culture\u201d, that the \u201cwider Aboriginal community accept and recognise [him] as a Koori man\u201d, and that he provided \u201cculturally sensitive care\u201d for her grandsons.\n\nHands also had letters of support from the recently-retired CEO of Merrimans Local Aboriginal Land Council, Anne Greenaway, who described \u201cher knowledge of Mr Hands being an accepted member of the local Aboriginal community\u201d, and a number of others who described his close connections with the Aboriginal community.\n\nIn court today Pritchard said Hawke was effectively being told: \u201cThis is an Aboriginal person\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s lived his whole life since he was a teenager as an Aboriginal person,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Hawke referred to Hands\u2019 statement that he was \u201cacknowledged as one of their own\u201d by communities on the South Coast, Pritchard argued that Hawke didn\u2019t properly engage with the impact on Hands and the community that removing him would have.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that he\u2019s engaged in the Aboriginal community, but that he\u2019s a part of the community,\u201d Chief Justice James Allsop said, summarising the argument, \u201cand the deep importance of that for both him and the community\".\n\nPritchard described it as \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that \u201cAboriginal communities have experienced considerable harm and hurt by definitions of Aboriginality imposed upon them\u201d.\n\nIn his decision upholding the visa cancellation, Hawke found that although Hands would suffer \u201cshort term hardship\u201d if sent to New Zealand, over time he would be capable of settling there \u201cwithout undue difficulty\u201d.

The cafe was one of the first to have an espresso machine in Melbourne.

But I'm happy.\"\n\nFriday's terror attack on Bourke St happened less than 100 metres from Pellegrini's. Malaspina was stabbed with a knife by Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, and died from his injuries. Two other men were also stabbed, and Shire Ali died after being shot by police. Malaspina was named as the victim on Sunday, and tributes have been flowing since.

In May the reintroduction program produced the first 15 eastern quoll joeys born on the mainland in over 50 years. The joeys are now roaming independently of their mothers and they've been observed climbing trees and hunting in the area.\n\nMaree Clout / Via Supplied\n\nThe eastern quoll is a notoriously feisty animal that eats insects and spiders as well as pests such as rabbits, mice, and rats, maintaining an important balance in the ecosystem.\n\nIt was once distributed throughout NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania but was driven to extinction on the mainland by predators such as foxes and feral cats.\n\nRewilding Australia / Via Supplied\n\nThe quolls' reintroduction to mainland Australia is a collaborative effort between Parks Australia, WWF, Australian National University (ANU), and Rewilding Australia.\n\nThe program was initiated following a 15-year effort by Booderee National Park to reduce fox numbers so the quoll population would have a chance to grow.\n\n\n\nMaree Clout / Via Supplied\n\nRob Brewster, director of Rewilding Australia, told BuzzFeed News he is cautiously optimistic that the eastern quoll could continue to proliferate in Booderee National Park and NSW as a whole. \"It's definitely early days, and a small population of any species has a much higher chance of going extinct, so it really is a numbers game,\" said Brewster. \"I'm very happy with the progress and we've proven a lot. We've proven that quolls on the mainland \u2013 where foxes are managed \u2013 can survive in the bush for over six months.\" Brewster says the quoll population will be monitored closely.

[It] suggests that it's not just a one-off thing, there's a process there,\" said Tye-Din.\n\nA strict and lifelong gluten-free diet is the only treatment for coeliac disease and Tye-Din said his team was interested in conducting this research because even people who say they follow the diet \"report symptoms or don't get the full healing of their bowel\".\n\nIn 2008 the NSW Food Authority conducted a review of 211 products that claimed to be gluten-free and found that 4.7% tested positive for traces of gluten.\n\n\n\nTye-Din says the levels of gluten found in the foods in the MJA study were low and unlikely to cause harm to people suffering from coeliac disease.\n\nThe main offender was a gluten-free pasta that was found to have 3mg of gluten per serve; Tye-Din states that consumption of around 10mg of gluten for those with coeliac disease per meal is considered safe.\n\n\"The reality is, it's unlikely at these levels to be harmful, [but] it's something that tells us, 'Well, we've detected it, and it's not in line with the Australian standard' \u2014 so that does need to be improved,\" he said.\n\nAnother study led by Tye-Din published in the MJA earlier this year reviewed the adherence of Melbourne restaurants to gluten-free claims by sampling meals and found that 9% of supposedly gluten-free meals contained detectable amounts of gluten.\n\nWhile Tye-Din is concerned about the manufacturing processes behind some gluten-free food, he says that \"eating out is far riskier for gluten-free patients than eating pre-packaged food\".", "The answer, to my utmost surprise, was yes.

But listen, guys \u2014 sewing is something pretty much every human should know how to do, and it's a lot easier than you might think. I\u2019m not talking about a high level of sewing: I really don\u2019t expect everyone to be able to draft up complicated patterns or sew a placket into a shirt, but c\u2019mon \u2014 being able to fix your zip or sew on a button does not require a tailor!\n\nTo be honest, I am not the greatest seamstress. I learned to sew from watching my mum and then begged for a sewing machine for my 14th birthday. I loved sewing. It gave me time to sit in my own thoughts and concentrate on something creative for a bit. Admittedly everything I made was rubbish, but that\u2019s not the point. I haven\u2019t put together a garment in years and I could not tell you about different types of seams, but I do own a sewing kit, which I recently realised a lot of people don\u2019t. Think of all the minor emergencies that can be easily solved if you just have a sewing kit to hand. I remember being on vacation when my bikini clasp popped off, and guess who was there for me? My humble pound-shop sewing kit. That sweet, sweet sewing kit and my basic sewing skills stopped me being bikini-less for the rest of the holiday. Obviously, it didn\u2019t help when I had to do a weird run covering myself back to my room, but let\u2019s not talk about that.\n\nBut even in slightly more everyday situations than my bikini nightmare, sewing is crucial because it actually saves you money. Hemming your own trousers actually takes a lot less time than you think and is relatively easy, which means you don\u2019t have to pay money for a tailor to do it. Plus, you don\u2019t have to leave your home to get them fixed, which if you\u2019re also lazy like me is a very big perk.\n\nYou\u2019ll find being a keen sewer saves you money in ways you weren\u2019t expecting. You\u2019re able to buy clothes that are slightly too big because you know you\u2019re able to make them fit you. If you have the ability to take seams in and out then you\u2019ll no longer need to throw away clothes as your body changes. It doesn\u2019t end there: There are loads of situations in which knowing your way around a needle and thread will save you money. Zips that are broken can be replaced, lining can be re-sewn, broken bags can be fixed, and of course you can start charging your pals to fix their clothes for them as a little side hustle.\n\nOf course, if you're not motivated by money-saving or avoiding embarrassing situations, might I interest you in a little thing called helping the planet? Instead of throwing away your clothes, you can learn how to fix them, which sounds like a lot of effort but it actually isn\u2019t when the world of YouTube tutorials exists. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, landfills received 10.5 million tons of textiles in 2015. You\u2019ll find your clothes last so much longer once you learn to maintain them; fixing the lining and replacing the fastenings will mean you have to replace your clothes far less often, meaning you\u2019ll contribute less to landfill waste and become a sustainable babe.\n\nI understand that not everyone has the time, energy, or ability to sew their own clothes, but next time a button falls off of your favourite blazer or you need to hem your trousers, please consider getting a needle and thread and giving it a go. The worst you can do is sew a shoddy button and have to get a professional to help out, but the best outcome is that you save money, contribute towards saving the Earth, and let go and switch off for a bit while learning something new.", "Amazon\n\nPromising review: \"This is both darling AND useful.

SOCORRO. A psiquiatra nova-iorquina Dra. Sue Varma contou ao BuzzFeed que isso acontece porque a ansiedade pode se manifestar como um \"excesso de obriga\u00e7\u00f5es\". Ela diz que \"Parece que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 tentando completar suas tarefas, mas, ao final do dia, parece que n\u00e3o fez muita coisa. Isso tamb\u00e9m pode acontecer por causa do TDAH, mas a m\u00e1 gest\u00e3o de tempo, a baixa produtividade e a dificuldade de priorizar as tarefas s\u00e3o geralmente indicativos do agravamento da ansiedade.\"\n\n2.

Sim, estamos vivendo em uma \u00e9poca aterrorizante, mas \"catastrofizar\" \u2014 o termo t\u00e9cnico para o pensamento obsessivo de que algo \u00e9 muito pior do que realmente \u00e9 \u2014 pode ser um sinal de que voc\u00ea est\u00e1, na verdade, sofrendo de um transtorno de ansiedade (em vez de apenas precisar dar um tempo nas not\u00edcias jornal\u00edsticas). A Dra. Bais diz que pensamentos como \"de que adianta, eu nunca vou conseguir fazer isso\", \"eu estou com problemas\", \"tem algo muito errado\" e \"tanto faz, n\u00e3o importa mesmo\" s\u00e3o um sinal de alerta, principalmente se s\u00e3o frequentes em vez de espor\u00e1dicos.\n\nPhoto by Ian Keefe on Unsplash\n\n3. Voc\u00ea fica assustado com facilidade. Voc\u00ea se sente excessivamente nervoso? Preste aten\u00e7\u00e3o nesse sentimento. De acordo com um estudo de 2008 publicado no peri\u00f3dico Depression and Anxiety, pessoas que sofrem de ansiedade tem uma resposta mais alarmante, principalmente quando est\u00e3o estressadas mentalmente (isso tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 catastrofizar), o que basicamente significa que voc\u00ea tende a entrar em p\u00e2nico com o menor dos est\u00edmulos, se estiver muito preso aos seus pensamentos.\n\n4.

Audrey Gruss, fundadora da Hope for Depression Research Foundation disse ao BuzzFeed que a irrita\u00e7\u00e3o gastrointestinal est\u00e1 frequentemente ligada \u00e0 ansiedade. \"As pessoas frequentemente discutem como o estresse pode se manifestar no seu est\u00f4mago e, com a ansiedade, acontece a mesma coisa\", diz. \"Ela pode piorar os sintomas das c\u00f3licas abdominais e a dor, fazendo com que as pessoas tamb\u00e9m se sintam enjoadas.\" Al\u00e9m disso, a ansiedade tamb\u00e9m pode dificultar a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de doen\u00e7as que n\u00e3o necessariamente est\u00e3o ligadas a ela. Um estudo de 2007 descobriu que para pessoas ansiosas, ter gastroenterite pode estimular a s\u00edndrome do intestino irrit\u00e1vel, uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o cr\u00f4nica que inclui dor estomacal, incha\u00e7o, diarreia e/ou constipa\u00e7\u00e3o.

Sentimentos de vergonha, inferioridade e autocr\u00edtica constante s\u00e3o parte do pacote do perfeccionismo. E, ainda no assunto: perfeccionistas que t\u00eam ansiedade geralmente recusam o tratamento terap\u00eautico por verem isso como um indicativo de fracasso, o que vai de encontro com o medo constante de errar.

Mas a ansiedade tamb\u00e9m pode causar dist\u00farbios do sono, e h\u00e1 pesquisas sugerem tamb\u00e9m o caminho inverso, ou seja que a falta de sono pode causar um transtorno de ansiedade. Ou seja, uma coisa piora a outra.

Keep up with the BuzzFeed News daily email!\n\nSign up", "We asked the BuzzFeed Community about their best tips and recommendations for traveling to Italy . Here's what they said!\n\nStevanzz / Getty Images\n\n1. Always give the house wine a try! And drink the local varietals. No matter what, eat local and if you enjoy drinking, ALWAYS GET THE HOUSE WINE! I guarantee it will be great quality, local, and unique to every location that you can\u2019t get anywhere else. \u2014hollyb31 Drink the local wine (Falanghina for Rome, Chianti for Tuscany, Prosecco for Venice). \u2014stephanielynng\n\n2. Try the local cuisine, too! Try the LOCAL food. Going to Tuscany? Try maybe panzanella or crostini. Going to the Amafi coast? Try something with fresh fish or crustaceans. Going to Naples? Definitely get pizza. Believe it or not, spaghetti and meatballs and alfredo aren\u2019t actually Italian. \u2014carlied2\n\n3. Check for free days at the museums. If you\u2019re interested in museums, try to look up when they do free days. Usually they do a free day like once a month. \u2014carlied2 [Editor's note: If there's a holiday on a day that's usually the free museum day, it might be rescheduled! For example, if a free day was supposed to be on Easter Sunday, it might be on the Monday after instead.]\n\nGivaga / Getty Images\n\n4. If someone in your party is disabled or otherwise has trouble standing for a long time, ask (politely, and preferably in Italian) if there's a disability line at the major sites. This goes for the elderly, people who are pregnant, people who have bad knees...if you think you'll have trouble standing for that long, it never hurts to ask! \u2014Andy Golder\n\n5. Check YouTube for local vlogs if you want some personal recommendations for restaurants. Before visiting Rome i watched some vlogs from ladolcelisa on YouTube. She has the best recommendations for restaurants and gelaterias. I tried almost every food spot and loved every single one. \u2014a407ae015c\n\n6. Learning some basic Italian will go a long way. Learn your basic italian, locals are very grateful of you trying to speak their language and they'll be more friendly and kind. \u2014kaatm If you're not sure where to start on learning Italian, just aim for learning some \"transactional\" phrases, like how to order food, buy tickets, or ask where the restroom is. Even just asking in Italian if someone speaks English will go a long way! \u2014Andy Golder\n\n7. Wander around! If you're able to walk, it's usually the best way to experience a city/town. Don't take a taxi! Walk as much as possible, getting lost usually ended up being a highlight of my trip. \u2014stephanielynng\n\nKatarina_b / Getty Images\n\n8. If you don't like crowds, you can still see amazing things in smaller cities. Don\u2019t underestimate the amount of tourists that go to Italy! Consider the season you\u2019re going and consider incorporating smaller, less popular cities into your trip. This summer we did Florence, Cinque Terre, and Genoa and LOVED Genoa because it felt so underrated and gave us space to breathe at the end of the trip. There weren\u2019t selfie sticks in our faces at every turn, locals seemed more apt to befriend us, and we had the best food of our entire trip on one of their recommendations (Cavour 21 \u2014 the best pesto you\u2019ll ever eat!). We also had a breathtaking rooftop apartment with full view of the city that cost less than accommodations in other cities. \u2014bens4d5ee73b1\n\n9. If you want to be able to use data on your phone, consider a portable router instead of getting a new SIM/phone for everyone in your group. Instead of buying a phone number with internet, it is much cheaper and smarter to buy a router with internet and share that with your travel buddies. I traveled with my aunt, uncle, and cousin, and we shared one Vodafone router for the week. There was more data than we knew what to do with, and so much cheaper than buying individual SIMs! \u2014englishmajor93\n\n10. Remember the rules for finding good restaurants: Rules to finding good, authentic restaurants: - Don't eat anywhere that advertises multilingual menus, free wifi or air conditioning - Don't eat anywhere that advertises a fixed tourist menu - Don't eat anywhere with picture menus - The further away from squares and big tourist attractions, the better - Often, the older and crappier the place looks, the better - Eat where the locals are eating (so nowhere where everyone looks like obvious tourists) - The fewer things on the menu, the better - Ask locals for recommendations \u2014sophievanderm\n\n11. As always while traveling in big cities, keep your belongings secure. Be wary of pickpockets! Make sure your bag is zipped up, and use cross-body bags if you can. They have a ploy where one guy tries to distract you (often by giving you something free like a bracelet) while another comes up behind you and tries to take your bag/something from it. Be extra conscious when in touristy spots especially! \u2014sarabrownie\n\n12. Keep the season in mind when choosing to travel. Don't go in August. It's really hot, super crowded and all the Italians are on vacation. So you'll be surrounded by pretty much only other tourists and many shops and restaurants are closed, because the owners are on vacation. The best time to visit Italy is May/June or September/October. \u2014sophievanderm The only week my family could get together to travel was Easter week, so Rome was especially packed. On the plus side, we got to see lots of cool stuff (the explosion of the cart in Florence was pretty neat, albeit super crowded) but tourist sites and museums had longer lines than usual. \u2014Andy Golder\n\n13. Consider taking a cooking class as an activity. Wherever you go, take a cooking class. It's such a fun experience and you'll have a recipe to take with you. That way you can relive the vacation in the comfort of your own home whenever you're missing that beautiful country. \u2014nikkiantonelli\n\n14. If you're planning on visiting a lot of churches or other holy sites, consider taking a shawl or scarf to cover up. I would suggest carrying a large scarf with you that way you can tie around your waist or drape over your shoulders when visiting churches and other sites. Also good for keeping the sun of your shoulders! I did this in Italy and other parts of Europe. \u2014ilanacs\n\n15. To save money at museums and other sites, consider downloading free audio guides and booking tickets/passes in advance. Definitely get the Rick Steves Italy guide! You can get it on iBooks and use it on your phone during your trip. It has great walking tour guides and a ton of interesting information about the stops along the way. I went to Italy as a student with very little money, so it was great to be a sort of free tour guide for my friends and I. \u2014laurenf49a2aef81 I also recommend getting a Firenze card in Florence if you\u2019re going to see a lot of the art and museums. This will save you a lot of money rather than paying for each individual museum or venue. [Editor's note: This can be great if you're visiting a lot of venues, but be sure to check regular ticket prices as well to make sure it's worth it for you!] \u2014hilaryt4c2912791\n\n16. Don't buy fluffy gelato. Look for the stuff that has a lid on it. You can tell the gelato is done properly when the pistachio flavour is a pale brownish green and is covered with a lid. Look for artisanal gelato and don\u2019t buy from ones that fluff it up like clouds \u2014 it means there is a lot of air whipped into it. \u2014amandad4aa6a2ab6\n\nJackf / Getty Images\n\n17. Palermo I was born in Northern Italy and I have family in Rome and Palermo. Both places are so full of rich history. If you want beaches, go to Palermo or Conca dei Marini. The Sicilian beaches are rivaled only by those on the Amalfi coast. If you go to Conca there is this charming little town on the cliffside leading to the beach, its on a bunch of google image searches for the area but not a touristy place like you would think. There it a little taxi boat service to take you from there to other little coves on the coast. Make sure you eat the seafood pasta! \u2014cristinagz\n\n18. Verona Verona is one of Italy\u2019s most underrated cities. The historical north Italian city served as a setting for Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, so you can imagine how much beautiful architecture there is to explore and take pictures of! \u2014karinaj411e90661\n\n19. Sardinia Visit Sardinia! it has the country's most beautiful beaches and the friendliest people, also the seafood is great and, because of it being an island apart from the country, it has a lot of different traditions and typical costumes and food but just as beautiful and delicious! \u2014kaatm For a affordable \"tropical island \" feel visit Sardinia! It hasn't been discovered by tourists yet. Sardinia has the most beautiful beaches in Italy and the people are among the healthiest in the world due to the healthy yet delicious food. \u2014karlsels\n\nManiscule / Getty Images\n\n20. Arezzo, Lucca, Cortona, and other Tuscan towns Florence is great, but don\u2019t forget about other great Tuscan towns like Siena, Arezzo, Lucca, Cortona, so many good cities that at are cheaper, more charming, and still have extensive Italian history. Best place to eat in Arezzo is Miva, or if you missing American food I recommend Alo burger. Want some Japanese? Head to Tao which is just outside of the train station. \u2014carlied2\n\n21. Dimaro and Fanano I lived in Italy for three months and saw all the high-tourist spots (Rome, Florence, Sicily), but every single bit of Italy is gorgeous. My best memories were at a northern ski town called Dimaro, and another northern farm town called Fanano, where I stayed at a stunning Agriturismo (basically a farm-to-table airbnb with cows, horses, dogs, cats, hiking, waterfalls, and anything else you could want). These places had either the architecture or drop-dead gorgeous countryside of Italy without any of the crowds, I met more people and tried more authentic Italian food, and I felt like I learned much more about the culture than if I would\u2019ve stayed in a larger town. \u2014jessicat474e40bcd\n\n22. Orvieto Visit the smaller towns! I went to Orvieto when I was there, a small town up on a rock cliff and it was one of the most memorable parts! Way less crowds with all the beauty and good food that Italt has to offer. \u2014juliet4a055d7de\n\nBlack-crow / Getty Images\n\n23. Puglia If you have the chance, try to get to the coast. The Puglia region is so beautiful. The Adriatic coast will also be cheaper to visit compared to the Mediterranean cities like Naples. You could take the train or a coach bus, it is pretty inexpensive. \u2014rinaldia2\n\n24. Capri Go to the island of Capri, it's gorgeous! Sure, it is known to be a \"ritzy\" place, but while studying abroad I was able to get great food and wine, and found some jewelry that I am in love with all on a college kid budget. \u2014partylovingchic\n\n25. Genoa One of my favorite cities in Italy was Genoa. It's an incredibly overlooked destination with a lot of history and personality. The food is also amazing, and since the region is known for its pesto, that's a must-try! My favorite restaurant there was Il Genovese. Another great food option is the Apertivo, which is when restaurants or bars offer an early-evening deal where if you order a drink you get access to an unlimited buffet. It's a great way to try a bunch of local dishes at once, as well as being very budget friendly! On top of all that, Genoa is a great place to stay if you're interested in visiting Cinque Terre, one of the most beautiful regions in Italy, and it's definitely one of the more affordable cities in the area. \u2014lily9\n\n26. Emilia Romagna (Bologna, Parma, Modena, Ravenna, Ferrara) As an Italian living in Italy I recommend visiting my region: Emilia Romagna. Food is great: in Bologna there is Fico (a theme park about food and wine), Parma with ham and Parmigiano, Modena with balsamic vinegar, on the coast you will have great fish and of course the wine everywhere is simply great. Art and monuments are all over, for example Ravenna is the capital of mosaics (where you can also attend a mosaic class from one of the artist living and working in Ravenna) or Ferrara with the wonderful Duomo and the great exhibition in the Palazzo dei Diamanti. And we can talk also about cars: Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Ducati... or the great spas we have, the mountains and the hills with castles, the welcoming coastal cities \u2014 all in one region! \u2014g4d96b5415\n\nShansche / Getty Images\n\n27. Rent a luxury sports car and drive through Tuscany: Test Drive Firenze in Florence was the highlight of our trip. My husband drove a Ferrari through the countryside of Florence to an exclusive hidden hotel overlooking the city where we received some hors d'oeuvres to enjoy in the most beautiful garden I have ever been in. Not to mention the whole drive was recorded for us on a CD. \u2014cincin86\n\n28. Book a Tuscan wine tour! Sure, it's touristy, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun: We did a Rome/Florence/Venice trip but while in Florence, we took a day trip to Tuscany with a tour group called TuscanyOnABudget. It was only 60 Euros and they took us to two wineries where we got to taste a ton of different wines and snacks. It was a perfect tour for three grad students backpacking on a budget. And we got to meet some really cool travelers on our tour that I still stay in touch with! Highly recommend it for anyone who's trying to get an authentic experience without spending a ton of money! \u2014jennal43f1628ac\n\n29. Have some antipasti right on the Arno river or eat at a restaurant with a panoramic view: If you like antipasti, check out Alimentari Uffizi in Florence. It\u2019s close to one of the entry points to Ponte Vecchio \u2014 probably the best cured meats I\u2019ve ever had or ever will. We got a very generous platter with delicious red wine, just the BEST. Also not too far from there is where had the best meal I\u2019ve ever had, hands down. It was at the Panorama Restaurant in the Hotel La Scaletta. Book the top terrace if you can! Simply beautiful view with THE BEST food. \u2014kristinm4545aa529\n\n30. Take a moment to sit outside the Duomo at night and enjoy an Aperol spritz (or another drink of your choice): When in Florence, sit outside of the Duomo at night and enjoy a spritz or two. It is a beautiful memory I\u2019ll never forget. It\u2019s so beautiful lit up. \u2014sfeichtinger\n\n31. And here are just a bunch of suggestions from a Florentine local: Hi, Florentine girl here! When in Florence make sure to eat at local restaurants, not the ones on the main streets (high prices, low quality), look for hidden restaurants. Otherwise, street food is great, if you have some time to stay in line, I recommand Antico Vinaio (via de' Neri), it makes \"schiacciate\" with traditional Tuscan food, but every shop in that street is great! Also Mercato Centrale di San Lorenzo is great, so many types of food in one location. Best gelato is not in the main squares or street! Look for Gelateria la Carraia and Gelateria in Piazza della Passera. If you want to drink, go to San Frediano, the left side of Arno River. Quiet at day, full of pubs and bars at night! Speaking of churches, visit Santa Croce, you'll find memorials of Galileo Galilei, Michelangelo, Rossini and many others. Boboli Garden is literally one of the best places in the world, you'll feel like a dame in Renaissance Florence walking there. \u2014elesantons\n\nShansche / Getty Images\n\n32. Visit the nearby towns of Burano, Sienna, and Assisi: Getting lost in Venice is magical and amazing. Nowhere is too far away to walk, except I recommend making a visit to neighboring Burano. No tourist restaurants, beautiful photo opportunities. Also, Sienna and Assisi are these fairytale-esque villages that are insanely beautiful and slow paced. I went in May when the weather was perfect no matter where we were (though Vatican City was warm midday because of all the concrete). Best food I had in the entire country was in San Giovanni Rotondo. Amazing. I dream about the sheep\u2019s cheese I had there. \u2014maginwagon\n\n33. Avoid scams like gondola rides and just walk around instead: I spent a week in Venice and it was absolutely beautiful. The best tip I received while there was to not spend any money on gondola rides. It\u2019s extremely expensive and a huge tourist trap. In the squares, there are a lot of scammers who are trying to sell you stuff such as roses or flying toys, don\u2019t buy it. Tour the cathedrals, they\u2019re absolutely breathtaking. And walk the city at least once at night. It feels as if you\u2019re transported back in time. \u2014sarahfelicityr\n\n34. Eat at Antica Trattoria Bandierette, Bistrot de Venise, or La Zucca: When in Venice go eat at Antica Trattoria Bandierette. It is hard to find and doesn\u2019t look like much but the food is amazing! I had one of the best squid pastas ever, looked terrible but the flavour! \u2014jenniferf21 The best meal I had in Venice was here: https://bistrotdevenise.com/?lang=en. It's definitely a splurge, but it was incredibly worth it! If you want to go big on one meal in a city that has too many restaurants to choose from, I highly recommend Bistrot de Venise. \u2014lily9 La Zucca in Venice - get one of the lasagnas, you won\u2019t ever be the same. \u2014 daniellet4a096c9f4\n\nShansche / Getty Images\n\n35. Try a food tour in Trastevere: Rome is fabulous! Book a food tour in Trastevere \u2014 you won\u2019t regret it. If you stay near the Pantheon, all the major sights are within walking distance so you can burn off all that pizza. Don\u2019t eat at the restaurants in the piazzas, but do grab a glass of wine or an Aperol spritz because they are great places for sitting and people watching. \u2014karlyh4bc1528df\n\n36. If you're checking out the Trevi fountain, try to go early or late. When it comes to the sites, go see the Trevi fountain but do it in the early morning or late afternoon, those alleyways can get very crowded. Piazza Navona is another favorite from my childhood. It is much too expensive to sit down at a restaurant for dinner there but if you grab some pizza nearby and sit in the square it is the pest place to people watch. Il Colosseo, la Bocca della Verita, and other classics are always nice to see as well but they are always crowded. \u2014cristinagz\n\n37. Check out the archaeological site of Ostia Antica to avoid the big crowds and expensive tickets: Visit Ostia Antica, the old seaport outside of Rome. You can basically walk among the ruins and see and do whatever you want because there's no tour guides. Not many people go, so you won't have to fight the crowds. Great place if you want to see the historical sites. \u2014m4ad55b619\n\nMgallar / Getty Images\n\n38. Take a stroll at night (but be sure to stay safe and go with a group!): Walk around Rome at night! Little or no crowds at all the monuments you want to see. Plus, it\u2019ll feel very ~romantic~ to walk in the street light (regardless of who you\u2019re with, went with three of my best friends and it was the best time). \u2014samanthar495908f21\n\n39. Eat at Roma Sparita and Rifugio Romano: Roma Sparita\u2019s Cacio e Pepe, which is Anthony Bourdaine approved and insanely delicious. \u2014daniellet4a096c9f4 I went to Rome over spring break and had the best meal of my entire 21 years of life at a restaurant called Rifugio Romano near the Termini train station. They have an extensive vegan menu and my friends and I were able to get a full three course meal. They also have a big non vegan menu as the restaurant isn\u2019t vegan. I highly recommend the vegan spaghetti carbonara, it was delicious and I still think about it to this day. \u2014evar415441640\n\nBe sure to follow BuzzFeed Community on Facebook and Twitter for your chance to be featured in an upcoming post!", "\"It was the most delightful smoothie I\u2019ve ever had,\" she said. \"I haven\u2019t had a smoothie that delightful since I was 10.

The former foreign minister, wearing Armani and a black straw boater hat, is the star attraction inside this temporary marquee, transformed into a shrine to female empowerment with very aspect, from the menu to the layout, produced by a woman. It is also, by the smell of things, paying homage to fake tan and espresso martinis. Bishop quickly becomes engrossed in a conversation with Battersby, who is wearing an oversized black floppy hat by Zimmerman and an elegant black and white Eliya dress with puffy sleeves that sit off her shoulders.

An event held in a car park on the outskirts of Melbourne\u2019s CBD since 1861. It is the annual spring racing carnival, one of the most popular events on the national calendar, and the international thoroughbred horse racing schedule. For four days in November hundreds and thousands of people flock to the Flemington race track to drink, gamble and rub shoulders with some of the most powerful and photogenic people in the world.\n\nSam Tabone / Getty Images (L-R): Former Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop; models Jordan and Zac Stenmark; and blogger Nadia Fairfax, in The Birdcage on Derby Day.\n\nThe Birdcage is where most of this mingling happens. Historically it was a \u201cbarrier\u201d built in 1887 for spectators to view the horses on Derby Day, Melbourne Cup Day, Oaks Day and Stakes Day before they raced. These days, Birdcage attendees don\u2019t go to see horses, they go to been seen.

But for 13-years before that he also bankrolled the evolution of The Birdcage when Emirates airline, the state-owned UAE carrier, became a major sponsor of the Victoria Racing Club. \u201cThe Birdcage used to be \u215b of the size it is now and it was organised on small budgets and everything was at ground level,\u201d Romano says. \u201cThe Sheikh was concerned that guests at the time couldn\u2019t see the races, so I got together with the other sponsors like Myer and we all decided to elevate the marquees about 1.5m so you could actually see the track.\u201d\n\nView this photo on Instagram Instagram: @judyromano1 Judy Romano with CEO of The Big Group events company Bruce Keebaugh, who starred in The Real Housewives of Melbourne with his wife, Chyka.\n\nRomano\u2019s innovation of the carnival is the stuff of legend. She did to The Birdcage\u2019s architecture what British model Jean Shrimpton did to the dress code in 1965 when she arrived wearing no hat, no gloves, no stockings and a skirt 12cm shorter than regulation.\n\nKeystone / Getty Images Jean Shrimpton at Derby Day in 1965.\n\nRomano may be best known for her work with the exclusive Emirates marquee, but for years she also managed enclosures and guest lists for L\u2019Oreal, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon and Saab (all of which have since vacated The Birdcage). While marquees went skyward, she says standards have not. Emirates ended it\u2019s $5 million a year contract in 2017 and this year was the first time in 27 years Romano has not been involved in the carnival. \u201cIt\u2019s all so boring now,\" she says. \"A lot of people are just there to be seen. Truly fabulous people don\u2019t. Hell, the most fabulous people I know don\u2019t even have Instagram.\"\n\nSupplied Michelle Battersby (in the blue and green dress) and friends in The Birdcage on Melbourne Cup Day.\n\nThe Birdcage used to be like the Bermuda Triangle, where the worlds of celebrity, politics and media would mysteriously come together, all lubricated from, on average, about 750 bottles of French champagne consumed over four days. Faux pas are still reported on, such as the time Enrique Iglesias arrived to the 2010 Cup wearing ratty jeans and a baseball cap (men must wear suits and ladies adhere to each specific day\u2019s colour palettes, such as black and white for Derby and florals on Oaks Day. Tantrums are still tabloid fodder.\n\nScott Barbour / Getty Images Enrique Iglesias inside the now defunct Emirates marquee during Melbourne Cup in 2010.\n\n\u201cIt used to make me sick the lengths people would go to to get into a marquee,\u201d Romano says as she recalls how people used to sneak in through the catering kitchens, or the time Shannon Noll once requested four tickets. \u201cWe said we\u2019d only give them to him if he performed, and he did!\u201d\n\nSergio Dionisio / Getty Images Shannon Noll and his wife at the 2008 Melbourne Cup.\n\nThe Birdcage is now, according to most commentators like The Sydney Morning Herald's Andrew Hornery and The Australia Financial Review's Rear Window columnists, capitalism\u2019s sideshow alley and the clowns are reality TV stars. Including Bachelor and Bachelorette alums including Keira Maguire, Lee Elliot and Georgia Love.\n\nAnd the Instagram famous, like former magazine beauty editor Eleanor Pendleton.\n\n\n\nEileen \"Red\" Bond agrees, but wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. The ex-wife of late Australian businessman Alan Bond (the bloke who bankrolled the 1983 America\u2019s Cup win) is a full VRC member and attends every race day, every year. Over the four days she held court on level 3 of the Lexus pavilion \u2014 a 76-seat restaurant helmed by executive chef Shaun Quade, co-owner of experimental Melbourne diner L\u00fbm\u00e9 \u2014 and downstairs on the balcony, where she enjoyed the Black Ant Lamingtons made from Daintree Rainforest chocolate, coconut and black ants. About 1,200 black ants were used to make those canapes and Bond couldn\u2019t get enough: \u201cI prefer them with cream but they were delicious.\u201d\n\nSupplied The Black Ant Lamingtons by Ben Shewry.\n\nBond was less enamoured with the fashion. \u201cSome people just don\u2019t realise that it\u2019s not fancy dress,\u201d she says while gesturing toward a fellow guest who is wearing a white mini dress and a shimmery headpiece resembling rabbit ears, and taking a selfie with a lychee cocktail. \u201cYou have to be elegant, but not boring. It\u2019s hard but so much fun,\u201d she adds while pulling on her oversized, diamond-encrusted Gucci sunglasses.\n\nPatrick Riviere / Getty Images Racing stalwart Eileen Bond attends the Melbourne Cup Carnivals every year. Here she is inside the Emirates marquee in 2004.\n\nDespite the generation gap between the new and old guards, an invitation to The Birdcage remains Australia's most coveted. \u201cThe bragging rights of saying you\u2019ve been to The Birdcage at the Melbourne Cup will have cachet forever,\u201d Romano says.\n\nQuinn Rooney / Getty Images Horses coming out from The Birdcage area before running the 2018 Melbourne Cup.\n\n\u201cThere used to be a common understanding that everyone is approachable inside and people like Julie Bishop and Gina Rinehart were, and still are, so gracious, as everyone was excited and happy to be there,\u201d she adds. This rapid shift from corporate celebrity enclosure to an ecosystem ruled by Bachelor and Bachelorette stars, bloggers and celebrities such as Elle Macpherson reportedly being paid about $100,000 to show up, could be explained by the damning royal commission into the Australian banking sector, a looming Victorian state election, and the voices of animal activists and gambling addiction advocates getting louder and louder.\n\nScott Barbour / Getty Images Elle Macpherson was a special guest inside the Lexus Marquee on Derby Day. She was reportedly paid $100,000 to attend.\n\nFor the four race days protestors waving placards of dead horses stood at the Epsom Road gates yelling \u201cHorse racing is murder\u201d while punters, dressed in their finery and hats, filed past politely. Not even flash flooding and sideways rain on Cup day dampened the spirits of the peacocks in The Birdcage, except one who demanded to be carried over the turnstiles for fear of ruining her $1,200 Balenciaga velvet heels.\n\nQuinn Rooney / Getty Images\n\nDespite taking a nasty fall down stairs when the strap of her kitten-heeled slingback came loose in 2016, Gina Rinehart fronted up again for Cup day this year. The mining magnate, who is also Australia\u2019s richest woman, quaffed champagne as she chatted to Australia\u2019s richest person, Anthony Pratt, and 21st Century Fox board member Sir Rod Eddington in the Tabcorp marquee, while Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and actress Rachel Griffiths had a chinwag in the corner.\n\nScott Barbour / Getty Images Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart and Australia's richest person Anthony Pratt inside The Birdcage on Melbourne Cup day.\n\nDown the road, inside Mumm\u2019s \u201cSpace Odyssey\u201d, things were more Buzz Aldrin than Bowie. Dynasty star Nathalie Kelley was enjoying a menu of \u201cbreakfast gels\u201d and \u201cfreeze dried fruit salad\u201d until she needed a fresh blow dry, after a champagne saber stunt went awry and she was soaked by 1.5 litres of bubbles.\n\nOver at Bumble, Bishop was back, \"[This is] Melbourne at its best,\" she said.

I was all about Human Casper at the time, but watching it now, Bill Pullman was a bit of a babe, hey. 18. I love Kat\u2019s cat-eye sunglasses. 19.

I wore a thumb ring for so long because of Christina Ricci in this movie. 22. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable.\u201d This is the first time I\u2019ve watched this movie and actually known what conceivable meant. 23.

It\u2019s really sad that Casper didn\u2019t cross over so his dad wouldn\u2019t be lonely, and then his dad was declared insane. 59.

How did I never get until now that this karaoke joint is deserted because the ghosts scared everyone away? 65. Dr Harvey just desperately needs some friends. Who aren\u2019t dead. 66. I can\u2019t believe this movie killed off Carrigan and Dr Harvey in a matter of minutes. 67. Why do they still look like their human selves when the other ghosts don\u2019t look remotely human? Do you become less human-like the longer you\u2019re a ghost, maybe? 68. I love that they defeat Carrigan by using her own ego against her. 69. I\u2019m so BROKEN over Casper sacrificing his one chance at life for Dr Harvey and Kat. 70. Okay but like didn\u2019t Casper\u2019s dad write his formula down anywhere? Surely they could just make more primordial potion? 71. Why did Amber actually think her costume with Vic would scare people as opposed to, you know, people just thinking they were in costume? 72. I love how it backfires, with the ghosts scaring them. 73. I\u2019m crying again at Kat\u2019s mum appearing to Casper and talking about how proud his dad is. 74.
