["I woke up at 5:48 a.m in pain. I was supposed to go hiking with my friends at 8:30 a.m. and then get brunch. But my pain woke me the fuck up, and I was unable to go back to sleep. My uterus was so swollen it felt hard to breathe, and it felt like my stomach was filled with a burning, chemical acid. I could tell almost immediately that it was not going to be a good pain day, and that I definitely would not be going hiking. I had to think fast. I had barely any food in the house and \u2014 due to my symptoms worsening as of late \u2014 there's a limited number of things I can actually eat without making my pain more intense at the moment. I knew I would likely not be able to leave the house later, so I forced myself to the grocery store at 7 a.m. Walking was painful. Moving was painful. Breathing was painful. But I knew if I didn't grab some food, I would not be able to eat all day or be forced to order from Postmates which would require getting off the couch, which on a day like Saturday would have been near impossible.\n\nWhen I got home with food I immediately got high by smoking an Indica strain (for a body high) because weed is the only thing that even remotely touches my pain on these types of days. Normally I try to avoid smoking and opt toward vapor pens or edibles, but again, this was a bad fucking pain day and I needed immediate and strong relief. Then, I sat like a zombie from those anti-drug commercials on my couch for the next nine hours. In order to be able to stand the pain, I have to make myself almost unconscious. I did everything I could to distract myself from the pain \u2014 I tried to sleep, I watched cooking shows, I read Harry Potter, but by 5 p.m. I was so emotionally distraught that I called my therapist and asked if she could see me ASAP. She squeezed me in and after sobbing on her couch for an hour about how I am tired of losing days of my life to pain, I went back home and watched cooking shows until I finally was able to fall asleep and forget about the pain. If only for a night.\n\nPain Level: 10/10, unable to walk or think of anything but my pain.", "\"If you build it, they will come.\" ( Field of Dreams )\n\nCorrect!

Even in my small, one-bedroom Manhattan apartment, I always volunteer to invite friends over for dinner, drinks, or just to hang out. But the idea of hosting Friendsgiving always stresses me out. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF NBC\n\nBetween the mess, all the moving parts, and the expense, throwing Friendsgiving can be demanding affair. Which is why I tried out a bunch of tricks to make hosting easier and more fun. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Funny Or Die Here are nine tips for an amazing Friendsgiving without spending a fortune or losing your mind.\n\nAlexa Fishman/BuzzFeed\n\n1. Make cocktails in your slow cooker Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Rather than stress out about making cocktails, let your slow cooker take care of the booze. This big batch spiced wine tastes like something you'd order at a restaurant or bar, but it requires almost zero effort whatsoever.\n\nThe are only two very easy steps: First, combine the ingredients in the slow cooker and next, turn it on. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed The wine, cider, and spices slow cook for about an hour. Then, just pour in the brandy and serve. I'll be making this all winter long. Recipe here.\n\n2. Try a DIY wine pairing with your Friendsgiving meal. Alexa Fishman/BuzzFeed Let this handy chart featuring five Thanksgiving-friendly wines be your guide. You'll end up spending about the same amount of money on booze, but it will feel way classier and make the meal more exciting.\n\nTo cut down on costs, you can always assign each of your guests to bring a certain type of wine. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF CBS For example, start with cava (like Anna de Codorniu Brut, $13) to pair with your appetizers, like baked brie and mushroom gruy\u00e8re tarts, before moving onto a Pinot Noir (such as Elouan Pinot Noir, $17) with the turkey and cranberry sauce.\n\n3. Try making an ice ring cocktail using a bundt pan. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Instead of making another boring party punch, freeze your booze into a tasty (and Instagrammable) ice ring cocktail. You'll need a bundt pan, a punch bowl, and your favorite big batch cocktail ingredients. I made apple cider sangria using a recipe I found online, but if you want more inspiration, check out this list of big batch fall cocktails.\n\nPour enough water in a bundt pan so that it's covering the whole bottom. This will help it freeze. Then, add all your ingredients \u2014 booze, juice, fruit, and spices \u2014 and freeze the mixture overnight. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nOnce frozen, transfer the bundt pan to a clear bowl. Pour some additional alcohol over the mixture so it starts to melt. Within a few minutes, it should pop right out of the bundt pan, while still keeping its shape. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Sure, it takes a little extra work, but it's a step above your usual party punch, and it looks impressive too.\n\nThe punch stays cold as it melts so you don't need ice. Ladle it it into glasses and top it off with more booze if you feel so inclined. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nAlexa Fishman/BuzzFeed\n\n4. Make a whole meal of bite-sized versions of classic Thanksgiving dishes. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed If you don't have a ton of room to seat all your guests around a big table, passing around a bunch of appetizers is a great option. You'll most likely save time on cooking and because you don't have to set a table, you'll reduce the number of dishes and utensils you'll have to wash at the end of the night.\n\nYou just boil pasta and whip up a cheese sauce made with butter, flour, cheddar cheese, and cream cheese. Then, combine the noodles, the sauce, and an egg until combined. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Bake the mac 'n' cheese bites in a muffin tin for about 15 minutes until the tops begin to get golden and crispy.\n\nYou can use either mini muffin tins or the regular size. I tried both and found the larger bites came out a bit better. The ingredients were more tightly packed and held their shape better once baked. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Recipe here.\n\nAnd these sausage and stuffing bites came together pretty quickly, and they only require some basic ingredients. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Instead of ground breakfast sausage, I used chicken sausage and chopped it into small pieces. I saut\u00e9ed the sausage with celery and onion, then add boxed stuffing, cheddar cheese, dried cranberries, chicken broth, and beaten eggs.\n\nForm the stuffing mixture into little balls and cook them on a baking sheet until they're brown. Serve them on toothpicks with cranberry sauce for dipping. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Recipe here.\n\n5. Use your microwave instead of your oven or stove. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Microwave recipes are useful whether you're celebrating Friendsgiving in a college dorm room or you just want to save some oven space for the rest of your meal.\n\nJust peel and slice russet potatoes into 3/4 inch strips. Then, cover them with plastic wrap and microwave them for about 20 minutes. Then, mash them with butter, milk, salt, and pepper. You'll want to start checking on the potatoes when you get to about 15 minutes. Some of mine got a bit burnt around the edges.\n\nFor the gravy, you combine flour and butter in the microwave. Then, you whisk in heavy cream, chicken broth, and Worcestershire sauce and keep microwaving until the sauce thickens. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Recipe here.\n\nYou just combine three ingredients \u2014 white cake mix, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, and pumpkin spice seasoning \u2014 in a mug and pop it in the microwave for two minutes. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed You can make a bunch of these in separate mugs or ramekins. Voil\u00e0: Cake without the help of an oven. Get the recipe.\n\n6. Instead of roasting a whole bird, make a low-maintenance turkey dish that still feels festive. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF FOX\n\n7. Make several desserts in one with these holiday sheet pan cheesecake bars. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed The first two steps are preparing the graham cracker crust and the cheesecake filling. I'd recommend starting with graham cracker crumbs, which you can find at pretty much any grocery store, so that the crust packs together.\n\nWhile the crust bakes, divide the cheesecake filling into separate bowls, and mix in your favorite desserts. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed I used cinnamon baked apples, pumpkin pur\u00e9e and pumpkin spice, and chocolate hazelnut spread, but you can get as creative as you want.\n\nDraw three lines in the graham cracker crust to separate the three different cheesecake fillings. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nThen bake the cheesecake in the oven for about an hour until the filling is set. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed\n\nPull it out of the oven and you've got three desserts in one. Cut it into little squares of pumpkin pie, apple pie, and chocolate cheesecake. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed And since cheesecake tastes best when it's been chilled, it's an easy dessert to make a day or two before your Friendsgiving. Recipe here.\n\nAlexa Fishman/BuzzFeed\n\n8. Turn pumpkins into adorable and seasonal flower vases I found a tutorial on blog Garden Therapy and followed the instructions. You don't need a green thumb or any arts and crafts skills to make these, take it from me.\n\nJust carve a hole in the top of the pumpkin, fill it with some soaked floral foam (which you can find at any craft store), then add your favorite flowers. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Place a few of these pumpkin vases on your holiday table instead of traditional flower arrangements. They're an inexpensive way to add a pop of color and a seasonal feel to your home.\n\n9. Or try making a colorful tie-dye pumpkin with just four supplies. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed I'd seen these bright and cheery pumpkins on Pinterest and Instagram, but I never realized how easy they are to make. You'll want to use a white pumpkin (real or fake) so that the colors show up well. Then you'll just need crayons, glue, and a hairdresser.\n\nSoak the crayons in a bowl of water for about 5 minutes so that the paper peels right off. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Then, break the crayons in half and fasten them around the stem of the pumpkin with tacky glue.\n\nNow, it's time to melt the crayons. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Take a hair dryer and blow hot air over the crayons. After about a minute, they'll start melting and dripping down the sides of the pumpkin. This doesn't make a lot of mess, but you'll want to do the blow drying over a paper towel or a rag.\n\nAnd there you have it, super cute pumpkin centerpieces in no time. Hannah Loewentheil/BuzzFeed Not to mention if you have kids at your Friendsgiving, this is the perfect DIY project to keep them entertained.\n\nHappy holidays, and have the best, most stress-free Friendsgiving ever!

The microphone worked perfectly for adult fun after the kids were in bed and held up to the children abusing it the next day. We used this nonstop for hours and the battery didn\u2019t die.

It has volume control for your voice and for the music and also echo. You can put an SD card into the bottom of it and record yourself or connect it with an audio out to record on one of those karaoke apps on your phone. With being able to find just about any song on karaoke via YouTube you could easily have your own karaoke parties at home! If you have a smart TV then add the YouTube channel to stream from there. The search menu is super easy to use.\" \u2014Ferretocious\n\n\"This is one of my most favorite purchases on Amazon! First I absolutely love the rose-gold color. Next the mic works with all the karaoke apps I tried, including Smule and Yokee. My husband and I really enjoyed taking our home karaoke to the next level. The carrying case is very protective and my only change would be better instructions on the Mode button. I\u2019m still unsure what it really does but I think it just changes to recording mode.

Mas o fato \u00e9 que minha pele estava bem, exceto por uma ou outra espinha que vinha \u00e0 tona no per\u00edodo pr\u00e9-menstrual. E, apesar de toda essa rotina elaborada, minha pele n\u00e3o era muito diferente de quando eu era adolescente e nem sabia o que era um hidratante facial.\n\nEnt\u00e3o, um ano atr\u00e1s, fiz uma entrevista com um dermatologista para um post, e ele me prescreveu uma rotina de cuidados para a pele composta de menos produtos e de produtos bem mais baratos. Comecei a seguir essa rotina e ela funcionou melhor do que a minha enorme cole\u00e7\u00e3o de s\u00e9runs e t\u00f4nicos cuidadosamente selecionados. Um ano depois, ela ainda funciona bem. Apesar de n\u00e3o usar m\u00e1scaras comuns, m\u00e1scaras de argila ou s\u00e9runs caros, minha pele ainda parece \u00f3tima depois desse um ano, exceto pelas poucas espinhas hormonais inevit\u00e1veis.\n\nVoc\u00ea conhece a frase: \"Se n\u00e3o est\u00e1 quebrado, n\u00e3o conserte\"? Por que n\u00f3s nunca aplicamos isso aos nossos corpos, especialmente \u00e0 nossa pele? E por que ficamos com a impress\u00e3o de que nossa pele est\u00e1 constantemente \"defeituosa\" e precisa de tratamento? Por que n\u00f3s, coletivamente, n\u00e3o aceitamos a ideia radical de que uma espinha, uma ruga ou um sinal aparecer\u00e1 aqui e ali e n\u00e3o precisamos gastar rios de dinheiro tentando consertar algo que \u00e9, na verdade, apenas o nosso corpo funcionando normalmente?\n\nAs mulheres, o principal p\u00fablico-alvo e as principais consumidoras de produtos para a pele, \u00e0s vezes acreditam que, se gastarem um pouco mais de tempo pesquisando, ou um pouco mais de dinheiro em outro produto, encontrar\u00e3o a combina\u00e7\u00e3o perfeita para desbloquear o n\u00edvel mais alto da exist\u00eancia, conhecido como \u201cpele perfeita\". Mas isso n\u00e3o existe! \u00c9 mentira! Enquanto isso, os cuidados para a pele direcionados aos homens s\u00e3o geralmente produtos para limpeza do rosto, que custam muito menos. E a pele deles n\u00e3o \u00e9 menos ou mais \u201cimperfeita\u201d do que a de qualquer outra pessoa.\n\n\u00c9 exatamente essa linha de pensamento que me fez sucumbir e comprar um s\u00e9rum de vitamina C. Eu li muitos artigos afirmando que o produto era maravilhoso e logo entendi que era isso que estava faltando na minha rotina: vitamina C, o ingrediente secreto! Hoje, n\u00e3o tenho ideia de qual a era a minha real expectativa. Eu n\u00e3o conseguia imaginar como seria essa tal melhoria na minha pele; apenas assumi que havia alguma melhoria a ser feita.\n\nDe alguma forma, todas n\u00f3s parecemos operar com a ideia de que a pele pode parecer algo diferente de pele, como se pud\u00e9ssemos nos livrar dos poros que s\u00e3o parte integrante dela, ou disfar\u00e7ar o fato de que ela \u00e9 algo que est\u00e1 em constante movimento, esticada e vincada em rugas. Ainda assim, comprei o s\u00e9rum de vitamina C e o passei no rosto de forma esperan\u00e7osa em uma manh\u00e3 normal. Meu rosto ficou quente no come\u00e7o, tive uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de ardor. Muito bom, pensei. A dor significa que est\u00e1 funcionando.\n\n\n\nVinte minutos depois, vi meu reflexo no espelho e minha pele estava rosada e quente ao toque. Eu n\u00e3o tenho ideia do que a vitamina C est\u00e1 destinada a fazer, mas tenho certeza que n\u00e3o era isso. Imediatamente lavei o produto e, felizmente, minha pele retornou ao seu estado normal e p\u00e1lido.\n\nNossos horm\u00f4nios, \u00f3rg\u00e3os e corpo inteiro est\u00e3o em constante estado de fluxo. Cada parte de n\u00f3s reflete isso: as espinhas e outros sinais t\u00eam uma fun\u00e7\u00e3o. \u00c0s vezes, eles podem ser um sinal de mal funcionamento, de desequil\u00edbrios hormonais ou outros problemas, mas uma \u00fanica espinha, ou v\u00e1rias, ou um pouco de secura, ou qualquer coisa que n\u00e3o esteja realmente atrapalhando sua vida, n\u00e3o \u00e9 motivo de preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nAqui est\u00e1 algo importante: se a sua pele est\u00e1 bem, deixe-a em paz. Uma espinha aqui e outra acol\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 problema. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa gastar metade do seu sal\u00e1rio em uma nova m\u00e1scara facial. Isso n\u00e3o vai ajudar em muita coisa. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 produto que d\u00ea uma pele perfeita para sempre, porque n\u00e3o \u00e9 assim que nosso corpo funciona. Os produtos de cuidado com a pele s\u00e3o divertidos, e se voc\u00ea gostar deles (como eu), continue usando. Mas se voc\u00ea se sentir exausta com tudo isso, se a ideia de criar uma \u201crotina de cuidados com a pele\u201d parecer uma tarefa que voc\u00ea precisa se for\u00e7ar a fazer, lembre-se: voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa fazer nada disso.\n\n\n\n(Por\u00e9m, ainda \u00e9 muito importante usar protetor solar todos os dias \u2013 mesmo que eu n\u00e3o compre mais m\u00e1scaras caras, n\u00e3o

The permanence of special arrangements for Northern Ireland in the overall Brexit deal is likely to anger the DUP. On Friday, the party accused Theresa May of breaking her promises over plans to avoid a hard border after a letter from the prime minister to DUP leader Arlene Foster was leaked to the Times.\n\nNegotiations have been stuck on the issue of the backstop for months. The solution the EU had proposed \u2014 to be used only if an alternative, and a future trade deal, was not agreed in time \u2014 would see the UK in a customs union, and Northern Ireland remaining, in effect, in the EU\u2019s single market for goods.\n\nSolving the backstop is crucial to securing a withdrawal agreement and a transition period.

You can find more Slumber Party posts here.\n\nWe're all aware that getting enough sleep is incredibly important for our mental and physical health , but that doesn't mean it's all of a sudden easy to make that happen. Logan Nolin / Unsplash When optimizing for sleep, it feels like there are a million little things that need to be taken into consideration from temperate, to lighting, to what we eat and drink in the hours before bedtime. But what would a truly perfect sleep environment look and feel like? I recently spoke to Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief of the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Dr. Rebecca Robbins, postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone, to find out everything we should be doing to get the best sleep of our life.\n\n1. Try your best to keep surrounding sounds under 60 decibels. \"Any sound over 60 decibels can seriously interfere with your sleep,\" says Robbins. This means that anything louder than a low conversation, humming refrigerator, or air conditioning unit needs to go, or be blocked out as much as possible. (For even more context, an ambulance siren is about 120 decibels \u2014 so, if you regularly hear them from inside your bedroom, you're likely to have trouble sleeping.) \"A lot of people believe that they actually sleep better with the television on, but during the lighter stages of sleep, everyone can be disturbed by even the lowest noise,\" Robbins says. \"If you do find it easier to fall asleep listening to the TV, music, or a podcast, be sure to put it on a timer, so that you're not disrupted as you move into lighter stages of sleep during the night.\"\n\n2. And if that's not possible in your home, try ear plugs or a white noise machine. Ear plugs are a great solution to sound pollution since they work to silence sounds, rather than mask them with even more noise \u2014 but, not everyone can sleep with earplugs. If you can't, Robbins suggests getting a white or pink noise machine. \"White noise is essentially background noise, while pink noise is a more natural sound, like sounds of the rainforest, rainfall, or wind. There's also some evidence that suggests pink noise might actually be a good thing to hear, even if noise isn't disrupting your sleep,\" Robbins says. You can get a white noise machine (that also plays natural sounds) from Amazon for $18.97 or 50 pairs of ear plugs for $17.99.\n\nSmusselm / Getty Images\n\n3. Keep your bedroom somewhere between 60 and 67 degrees This tip is one that gets repeated a lot \u2014 but that's mainly because it's so important. To keep your bedroom within this temperature range is to create what scientists refer to as a \"thermoneutral zone.\" Basically, this is the temperature range in which the human body doesn't have to work (e.g. sweat or shiver) to maintain an ideal temperature. \"If you try to sleep in a temperature that isn't thermoneutral, your body will ultimately begin fighting to regulate its own temperature and will keep you from going into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,\" Czeisler says. REM is the most restorative period in our sleep cycle, so is super important. It's also when we dream, so if you're someone who never dreams, this could be an indicator that the temperature in your bedroom needs adjusting.\n\n4. And don't have a hot bath or shower right before bed. According to the National Sleep Foundation, doing so can cause your body temperature to spike, which means your body will have to work to regulate itself and find that sweet thermoneutral zone.\n\nMink Mingle / Unsplash\n\n5. Decorate your room in soft and neutral colors that denote feelings of coziness and relaxation. \"Colors can make a big difference,\" says Robbins. \"When you\u2019re in your bedroom, you really want to relax, so think about neutral tones like beige, light blue, or pastels. You want to avoid any bright or overly alerting colors like bright green or red, for example.\"\n\n6. And when sleeping, keep your room as close to completely dark as possible. \"A dark room tells your brain that it's time for bed. When you turn off your lights, you want to make sure that the room is completely dark,\" says Robbins. \"It\u2019s best to refrain from any light coming in from the streets or even from a blinking cable box. The little things really matter, so try to blackout your bedroom as much as possible.\" If this isn't possible for you, opt for an eye mask that you can blink underneath, so it doesn't disrupt the eye movement that occurs during different periods of sleep. Get a three-pack of contoured eye masks from Amazon for $10.99.\n\nBelchonock / Getty Images\n\n7. If you get up a lot during the night, consider investing in motion-activated night lights for your bathroom. We all know the feeling of waking up to go to the bathroom only to fumble around in the dark before giving up and reaching for the light switch. To avoid this sleep-sabotaging scenario, Czeisler suggests installing a nightlight in your bathroom so you can stay sleepy during your midnight bathroom visit without injuring yourself in the complete darkness. Get a motion-activated toilet lights from Amazon for $8.99.\n\n8. And go for warm low-wattage lightbulbs over bright LEDs in the bedroom. According to the National Sleep Foundation, LEDs aren't ideal for the bedroom or bathroom, despite being energy efficient. These bright lights emit harmful blue light (just like your phone and other screens) that can seriously mess with your melatonin secretion, tricking your brain into thinking it's still daytime. Instead, they suggest using incandescent bulbs, which diffuse a soft warm light, or installing red or pink lightbulbs \u2014 or even string lights \u2014 in your bedroom.\n\nWarchi / Getty Images\n\n9. Rather than sleeping late on the weekends, give yourself permission to take an afternoon weekend nap. If you work Monday to Friday, it's likely that you get up around the same time every day during the week \u2014 but on the weekends, for a lot of us, it's a completely different story. However, sleeping late on Saturday and Sunday isn't doing you any favors. Instead, Robbins suggests getting up at the same time as you would on weekdays, and then taking an afternoon nap if you need some extra sleep. \"Even if you\u2019ve had a later night than usual and you\u2019re exhausted, kick yourself out of bed at the normal time and then take a nap that afternoon,\" says Robbins. \"This will do you many favors because your biological clock will start in the morning and begin that countdown to bedtime, keeping your consistent sleep schedule. The nap will pay back your sleep debt without the consequence of throwing you out of schedule.\"\n\n10. Familiarize yourself with the lifespan of your mattress and pillows, then replace when needed. Even people who sleep poorly still spend a lot of time in bed \u2014 whether they're reading, watching Netflix, or just, you know, lying completely still waiting for sleep to eventually (any time now!) come. All of that time in bed wears and reshapes your mattress and pillows, which affects their quality and comfort. \"So many people can't even remember when they purchased their mattress,\" says Robbins. \"A good mattress will last about eight years \u2014 not forever. It's also important to think about refreshing your pillows, because even the best one will only last about a year and a half.\"\n\nToa Heftiba / Unsplash\n\n11. Make your before-bed routine as cozy as possible. A good bedtime routine isn't something that just happens \u2014 it takes intention and practice. It can, however, make the world of difference when it comes to getting your mind and body prepared for sleep. \"Take the time to engage in a very relaxing routine before bed; light a candle or read a couple of pages from a book. Really think: How can I best unwind and prepare for the night ahead?,\" says Robbins.\n\n12. Exercise regularly, but try and avoid working out right before bed if you find it hard to wind down at night. \"Exercise is really great, as it releases endorphins, which are also mood elevators and reduce stress. This is most likely why people who exercise regularly get better sleep,\" says Robbins. \"As far as what time to exercise, there's evidence that it actually doesn\u2019t matter if you exercise before bed. But, if you do find yourself having a hard time unwinding and getting your heart rate down at night, it might be best to get your workout done earlier in the day.\" Basically, listen to your body and if you find it harder to fall asleep after a nighttime workout, try switching up your routine and exercise in the morning or early afternoon.\n\nGuillermo Nolasco / Unsplash\n\n13. Don't drink alcohol before bed, even you swear it helps you fall asleep faster. \"Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, so while it will in fact help you wind down, it will also disturb sleep and lead to nocturnal awakenings. If you plan on drinking, it would be best to consume alcohol earlier in the day and evening, so that by the time you go to bed you will have a zero blood alcohol level,\" says Czeisler.\n\n14. And also try to avoid food and drink that are high in sugar The more sugar you eat during the day, the more likely you are to wake up \u2014 or be pulled out of a deep sleep \u2014 during the night, as it causes your energy levels to spike.\n\nJessica Knowlden / Unsplash\n\n15. Don't share your bed \u2014 or bedroom \u2014 with your pets. Pets are great! So very great! But one thing they're especially great at is disturbing your sleep. Just like a car horn or flashing light, a dog or cat jumping or moving around on the bed can, and will, wake you up \u2014 which is why Czeisler suggests keeping them out of the bedroom.\n\n16. And if you truly want a great sleep, don't smoke cigarettes. Not only does smoking make it harder to fall asleep, it also makes it harder to wake up in the morning \u2014 a truly terrible combination. Research has also found that smoking cigarettes can increase nightmares and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Em meio aos dois navios, um min\u00fasculo barco de madeira esperava a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do impasse, lotado com pessoas que o navio da ONG tentava resgatar. Eram homens, mulheres e crian\u00e7as que haviam fugido de Zuara (L\u00edbia), na noite anterior, na esperan\u00e7a de chegar \u00e0 Europa. O BuzzFeed News esteve a bordo da \u00faltima miss\u00e3o do Aquarius e pode testemunhar as in\u00fameras dificuldades que hoje enfrentam opera\u00e7\u00f5es de resgate no Mediterr\u00e2neo. No caso do Aquarius, os l\u00edbios foram apenas mais um obst\u00e1culo.

O BuzzFeed News se juntou \u00e0 eles por 20 dias, em setembro, para ver o funcionamento dessas miss\u00f5es de busca e resgate de refugiados em alto mar. Politicamente, as na\u00e7\u00f5es europeias est\u00e3o ignorando as mortes no Mediterr\u00e2neo central, empurrando o problema para os l\u00edbios. Os europeus est\u00e3o cansados da chegada de refugiados e migrantes \u2014 como demonstrado pelo resultado das \u00faltimas elei\u00e7\u00f5es em todo o continente. Isso tem tornado as miss\u00f5es de resgate do navio cada vez mais dif\u00edceis. A pergunta agora \u00e9: at\u00e9 quando navios de busca e resgate, como o Aquarius, conseguir\u00e3o continuar salvando refugiados?\n\nDavid Ramos / Getty Images Refugiados e migrantes ap\u00f3s serem resgatados em alto-mar.\n\n\u201cEu n\u00e3o me chamaria de humanit\u00e1rio. Afinal, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o chamaria a brigada de bombeiros de humanit\u00e1ria\", disse Nick Romaniuk, de 33 anos, coordenador de busca e resgate do SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u201cAs pessoas est\u00e3o morrendo no mar. Simples assim.\" Aproximadamente 14.743 homens, mulheres e crian\u00e7as morreram tentando atravessar o mar vindos da L\u00edbia, do Egito e da Tun\u00edsia at\u00e9 a Europa desde 2014, de acordo com o projeto Migrantes Desaparecidos. Segundo a Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Internacional de Migra\u00e7\u00e3o, 128.082 pessoas completaram essa viagem em 2017 e 39.145 neste ano.\n\n\n\nAinda que o n\u00famero de pessoas tenha diminu\u00eddo, a viagem nunca foi t\u00e3o perigosa: em julho deste ano, o Alto Comissariado das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas para os Refugiados (ACNUR) estimou que uma pessoa morria afogada para cada sete que tentavam atravessar o Mediterr\u00e2neo. O Aquarius \u00e9 um dos poucos barcos de ONGs que ainda trabalham para salvar vidas no Mediterr\u00e2neo central. Desde o seu lan\u00e7amento, em 2016, de acordo com os registros do navio, ele salvou a vida de 29.523 pessoas que tentavam atravessar o mar \u2014 e assim se tornou sin\u00f4nimo da crise de refugiados, provocando tanto o \u00f3dio como ganhando respeito. A opera\u00e7\u00e3o do navio de 2 mil toneladas custa aproximadamente US$ 12,6 mil por dia \u2014 divididos entre o SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e e o M\u00e9dicos Sem Fronteiras \u2014 e opera em \u00e1guas internacionais ao longo da costa da L\u00edbia, origem da maioria dos barcos ilegais que tentam chegar \u00e0 Europa. Quando um barco \u00e9 localizado, as equipes do SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e lan\u00e7am duas lanchas infl\u00e1veis (conhecidas como RHIBs) para retirar as pessoas da \u00e1gua e transferi-las para o Aquarius. A equipe m\u00e9dica a bordo do MSF \u2014 um m\u00e9dico, uma parteira e duas enfermeiras \u2014 imediatamente faz a triagem e trata as pessoas resgatadas. Ent\u00e3o o Aquarius leva as pessoas que resgatou para a Europa e imediatamente retorna \u00e0s \u00e1guas internacionais para continuar trabalhando. Pelo menos, \u00e9 assim que costumava funcionar. Quando o Aquarius zarpou acompanhado pelo BuzzFeed News, de Marselha, na Fran\u00e7a, em 15 de setembro, ele havia ficado parado no porto por mais de duas semanas. Ele n\u00e3o podia partir porque havia perdido o direito de navegar sob a bandeira de Gibraltar em 13 de agosto. De acordo com a lei mar\u00edtima, qualquer embarca\u00e7\u00e3o que navegue em \u00e1guas internacionais deve estar registrada em um Estado. Um navio sem uma bandeira n\u00e3o \u00e9 exatamente um navio pirata, mas n\u00e3o est\u00e1 muito longe, e, de forma crucial, a bandeira de um navio fornece prote\u00e7\u00e3o caso ele tenha dificuldades em mar aberto. Quase um m\u00eas se passou at\u00e9 o SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e e o MSF garantirem uma bandeira panamenha \u2014 que responde por aproximadamente 18% da navega\u00e7\u00e3o mundial \u2014 e o navio poder partir com seguran\u00e7a. Mas sempre que o Aquarius entra nas \u00e1guas da L\u00edbia, ele agora enfrenta outro problema: os r\u00e1dios n\u00e3o respondem. Falando ao BuzzFeed News, a tripula\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o conseguiu explicar por que desde sua \u00faltima miss\u00e3o (mais de um m\u00eas antes) o navio n\u00e3o tem mais recebido as mensagens de r\u00e1dio padr\u00f5es \u2014 geralmente transmitidas atrav\u00e9s de um canal dispon\u00edvel para todos os navios na \u00e1rea \u2014 assim que ele entra nos mares sob a autoridade da guarda costeira da L\u00edbia. \"\u00c9 um completo apag\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es\", disse Romaniuk, que trabalhou em navios de resgate no Mediterr\u00e2neo central por tr\u00eas anos. \"Era dif\u00edcil no come\u00e7o \u2014 milhares de pessoas morriam porque a opera\u00e7\u00e3o de resgate em si j\u00e1 era dif\u00edcil \u2014, mas agora a parte de busca est\u00e1 se tornando ainda mais complicada.\" O navio se tornou dependente da equipe do SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e para observar (em turnos de hora em hora do nascer ao p\u00f4r do sol), para ouvir trechos de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es de r\u00e1dio entre navios mercantes e para obter sinais de socorro pedidos pelas embarca\u00e7\u00f5es ilegais e que chegam a ONGs em terra firme. A tripula\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o sabe \u2014 e muitas vezes n\u00e3o \u00e9 informada at\u00e9 que seja tarde demais \u2014 quando h\u00e1 barcos em perigo. E quando \u00e9 informada, ela pode entrar em confronto com a guarda costeira da L\u00edbia. Em parte, isso decorre de um acordo com o governo l\u00edbio, negociado pelo pol\u00edtico italiano Marco Minniti em 2017. O acordo destinou \u20ac 43 milh\u00f5es de fundos da UE para a L\u00edbia combater a crise de refugiados e evitar que eles chegassem \u00e0 Europa. O efeito foi dram\u00e1tico. O n\u00famero de barcos que voltaram para a L\u00edbia aumentou em aproximadamente 194%, ou cerca de 13 mil pessoas, desde o acordo. O acordo da UE tamb\u00e9m rompeu com uma das principais conven\u00e7\u00f5es de resgate mar\u00edtimo, de que as pessoas devem ser levadas de volta a um local de seguran\u00e7a internacionalmente reconhecido. As Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas e o Tribunal Europeu dos Direitos Humanos concordam que a L\u00edbia n\u00e3o \u00e9 um lugar seguro. Na \u00faltima miss\u00e3o, 11 de 42 mulheres disseram explicitamente \u00e0 parteira Nina Egger, 32 anos, do MSF, que elas haviam sido v\u00edtimas de abuso sexual \u2014 \"e esse \u00e9 apenas o n\u00famero de mulheres que veio falar comigo\", disse ela. Ela j\u00e1 ouviu mulheres falarem sobre estupros coletivos, homens for\u00e7ados a estuprarem uns aos outros ou mulheres sob sua prote\u00e7\u00e3o, m\u00e3es estupradas na frente de crian\u00e7as e pessoas estupradas at\u00e9 a morte com objetos. Basicamente, a L\u00edbia levou a \u201cviol\u00eancia sexual a outro n\u00edvel\u201d. E o pa\u00eds recentemente quebrou o acordo e entrou em guerra civil aberta. \"Sabemos que Tr\u00edpoli est\u00e1 desmoronando\", explicou Egger. \"N\u00e3o sabemos como a guarda costeira da L\u00edbia est\u00e1 funcionando no momento, se est\u00e1 funcionando corretamente.\" Pol\u00edticos europeus t\u00eam fechado os olhos para a situa\u00e7\u00e3o, deixando a guarda costeira da L\u00edbia fazer o trabalho sujo \u2014 uma tentativa de salvar seus pr\u00f3prios interesses pol\u00edticos, j\u00e1 que a imigra\u00e7\u00e3o se tornou um tema nocivo entre os eleitores na Europa. A Alemanha, que j\u00e1 foi vista como \"o exemplo\" do continente para a migra\u00e7\u00e3o, tem testemunhado a extrema-direita protestar e atacar os migrantes, inflamados por rumores on-line. A Fran\u00e7a limitou ainda mais suas regras de imigra\u00e7\u00e3o em julho, incluindo uma medida que permite que migrantes n\u00e3o autorizados sejam detidos por at\u00e9 um ano. A Espanha recebeu apenas 11% de sua cota da UE de refugiados, e o novo l\u00edder da Frente Popular de direita do pa\u00eds recentemente prometeu \u201cdefender as fronteiras\u201d contra os \u201cmilh\u00f5es\u201d de migrantes.\n\nLaura Lezza / Getty Images Matteo Salvini em discurso no in\u00edcio deste ano.\n\nLiderando essa mudan\u00e7a de atitude est\u00e1 o ministro do Interior da It\u00e1lia, Matteo Salvini, que tem uma antipatia especial pelo Aquarius, sobre o qual ele tuitou repetidamente durante a \u00faltima viagem. Em coment\u00e1rios recentes, ele afirmou que o navio estava \"auxiliando a imigra\u00e7\u00e3o ilegal e os contrabandistas\" e prometeu que n\u00e3o haveria porto seguro para o Aquarius quando transportasse migrantes. As implica\u00e7\u00f5es mais amplas s\u00e3o abrangentes. Se a tripula\u00e7\u00e3o de um navio qualquer n\u00e3o tiver certeza de que poder\u00e1 voltar \u00e0s \u00e1guas europeias se estiver transportando migrantes ou refugiados, ela simplesmente nem far\u00e1 o resgate. \u201cAs conven\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o t\u00e3o fortes quanto as pessoas que as seguem\u201d, disse Tom de Kok, 39, coordenador do MSF em exerc\u00edcio. \u201cEstamos no processo de destruir algo que tem sido um pilar da civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o h\u00e1 2 mil anos.

Ele estava no barco de madeira com sua fam\u00edlia quando o Aquarius, e depois a guarda costeira da L\u00edbia, se aproximou. O BuzzFeed News est\u00e1 identificando F. apenas por sua inicial porque ele teme que a divulga\u00e7\u00e3o de seu nome possa colocar sua fam\u00edlia em perigo na L\u00edbia. Romaniuk e F. \u2014 um acima, um na \u00e1gua abaixo \u2014 observavam com crescente pavor o navio l\u00edbio cada vez mais perto. F., agarrando seu filho mais novo, Oles, de 2 anos, estava aterrorizado. Embora o Aquarius estivesse seguindo as conven\u00e7\u00f5es mar\u00edtimas, os l\u00edbios n\u00e3o pareciam se importar. De acordo com a lei mar\u00edtima, o Aquarius era o navio mais pr\u00f3ximo capaz de realizar um resgate de um barco em perigo com seguran\u00e7a, por isso havia entrado em opera\u00e7\u00e3o para fazer o resgate. Romaniuk havia contatado repetidamente a central de coordena\u00e7\u00e3o marinha italiana em Roma, mas \u2014 agindo contra as conven\u00e7\u00f5es \u2014 os italianos deferiram a autoridade aos l\u00edbios. Esses mesmos l\u00edbios simultaneamente amea\u00e7aram levar o barco de madeira para a L\u00edbia e exigiram que o Aquarius deixasse a \u00e1rea imediatamente, sem realizar o resgate. F. n\u00e3o sabia que na ponte de comando do Aquarius, Romaniuk, trabalhando ao lado de Seraina Eldada, de 24 anos, estava agora negociando desesperadamente em \u00e1rabe com os l\u00edbios pelas vidas de sua fam\u00edlia e das outras 41 pessoas no barco. Lotte Bridgham, tentando levar as pessoas do barco de madeira para as lanchas infl\u00e1veis da ONG, sabia que, no momento em que ela e a tripula\u00e7\u00e3o perdessem o controle da situa\u00e7\u00e3o, o resgate poderia se tornar mortal, e, atrav\u00e9s de um int\u00e9rprete, tentava desesperadamente comunicar o que estava acontecendo. \u201cQuando o navio se aproximou, era poss\u00edvel ver pessoas olhando em volta e se sentindo muito tensas, quase como se tivessem perdido a confian\u00e7a por um segundo, como se estiv\u00e9ssemos esperando pela guarda costeira da L\u00edbia\u201d, disse Bridgham, que trabalha para o SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. F. n\u00e3o podia falar com Bridgham de onde ele estava na \u00e1gua, mas ele podia ver o barco e estava paralisado de pavor. Como um berbere \u00e9tnico e ateu, ele enfrentaria discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o e persegui\u00e7\u00e3o se fosse devolvido \u00e0 L\u00edbia. Horas antes, ele embarcara com sua fam\u00edlia naquele barco fr\u00e1gil ap\u00f3s pagar milhares de dinares l\u00edbios. Eles deixaram para tr\u00e1s quase tudo (incluindo a gata da fam\u00edlia, Lily), na esperan\u00e7a de um futuro melhor na Europa. \u201cEu sei que muitas pessoas j\u00e1 morreram. Mas eu disse [\u00e0 minha mulher] que talvez viver\u00edamos, se fiz\u00e9ssemos a travessia\u201d, disse ele. \"Na L\u00edbia n\u00e3o h\u00e1 pessoas de cabe\u00e7a aberta\", disse ele. Quando sua filha mais velha entrou na escola, perguntaram a ela se havia um Alcor\u00e3o na casa da fam\u00edlia, e ela disse orgulhosa \u00e0 professora que n\u00e3o. \"[Eles disseram a ela] 'Vamos queimar voc\u00ea, voc\u00ea vai para o inferno se n\u00e3o acreditar.' S\u00e3o crian\u00e7as\", disse F., visivelmente aborrecido. \"Como voc\u00ea pode dizer isso?\" \"Eu n\u00e3o tenho escolha agora. L\u00edbia \u2014 fico e morro. Se for embora, talvez eu viva\", disse F. Entre os que compartilhavam o barco com F. e sua fam\u00edlia, estavam 17 crian\u00e7as e 14 mulheres. Havia 47 pessoas a bordo \u2014 37 delas l\u00edbias. A fam\u00edlia de F. exemplifica o perfil de mudan\u00e7a daqueles que est\u00e3o sendo apanhados pelo Aquarius. Anteriormente, a maior parte das pessoas que vinham do mar j\u00e1 era refugiada de seus pa\u00edses de origem: s\u00edrias, iraquianas, afeg\u00e3s ou nigerianas, por exemplo. Mas, como visto pelo BuzzFeed News, a demografia dos que est\u00e3o sendo resgatados est\u00e1 mudando. At\u00e9 julho de 2018, pouco mais de 400 l\u00edbios se refugiaram com sucesso na Europa, de acordo com dados do ACNUR. Muitos citam a instabilidade no pa\u00eds ap\u00f3s anos de conflito depois da morte do ditador Muammar al-Kadafi. Algumas \u00e1reas est\u00e3o agora nas m\u00e3os de uma mistura de mil\u00edcias, que controlam a popula\u00e7\u00e3o muitas vezes por meio de intimida\u00e7\u00e3o, medo e extors\u00e3o violenta com sequestros. Embora relativamente em pequeno n\u00famero, as pessoas que est\u00e3o partindo demonstram a volatilidade de uma na\u00e7\u00e3o que deixou muitos de seus cidad\u00e3os sem op\u00e7\u00e3o, exceto fugirem ilegalmente. As amea\u00e7as ainda estavam chegando na ponte de controle do al-Khifa, mas o tom estava mudando agora que havia um fluente em \u00e1rabe na linha. Eldada fez sinal para Romaniuk. \"Eles est\u00e3o nos ordenando a voltar\", disse ela. \"Eles est\u00e3o dizendo que devemos permanecer a 80 milhas da costa, e se [n\u00f3s] os desobedecermos novamente, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea dever\u00e1 ir a Tr\u00edpoli e enfrentar uma a\u00e7\u00e3o legal.\" \u201cDiga a eles que entendemos a situa\u00e7\u00e3o. Diga a eles que temos mulheres e crian\u00e7as e que pedimos permiss\u00e3o para traz\u00ea-los a bordo\u201d, disse Romaniuk a Eldada. A mensagem foi rapidamente transmitida em \u00e1rabe. A ponte de comando estava silenciosa, exceto pela voz suave de Eldada. \"H\u00e1 tanta responsabilidade sobre seus ombros nesse momento, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode se dar ao luxo de pensar nisso. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode se dar ao luxo de se preocupar com o fracasso: n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma op\u00e7\u00e3o\", disse Eldada mais tarde. Todos na ponte de comando prenderam a respira\u00e7\u00e3o enquanto Eldada falava no r\u00e1dio, os olhos fixos no delicado cen\u00e1rio de vidas em risco nas \u00e1guas calmas abaixo deles. De repente, o \u00e1rabe parou. Uma voz do al-Khifa, falando em ingl\u00eas, disse \u00e0 ponte de comando: \"Deixamos essa situa\u00e7\u00e3o nas suas m\u00e3os.\"\n\nMaud Veith / SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Refugiados e migrantes s\u00e3o trazidos a bordo durante a \u00faltima miss\u00e3o.\n\nRomaniuk virou-se na dire\u00e7\u00e3o do r\u00e1dio, e as lanchas aceleraram seus motores. Sua equipe finalmente tinha permiss\u00e3o para voltar ao Aquarius, de volta \u00e0 seguran\u00e7a e longe dos l\u00edbios. \"Quando recebemos a luz verde, todos de repente respiraram\", disse Bridgham. A alegria durou pouco. Os l\u00edbios haviam lhes dado permiss\u00e3o para resgatarem as pessoas e devolv\u00ea-las \u00e0 Europa \u2014 mas isso era com base na bandeira deles, a do Panam\u00e1. Ocorre que, poucas horas antes, esta mesma bandeira havia sido removida pelas autoridades panamenhas. A tripula\u00e7\u00e3o do Aquarius, assim como as pessoas que tinha acabado de resgatar, estava \"sem p\u00e1tria\" e sem saber para onde ir.\n\n\n\nResumidamente, a bandeira de um navio \u00e9 como o passaporte de uma pessoa. Sem uma, um navio n\u00e3o tem liberdade de movimento nem a prote\u00e7\u00e3o do Estado-na\u00e7\u00e3o com o qual est\u00e1 registrado. A decis\u00e3o do Panam\u00e1 de remover a bandeira do Aquarius pegou a equipe de surpresa apenas algumas horas antes do resgate: as autoridades n\u00e3o acharam adequado alertar a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o de caridade comandando o navio. A not\u00edcia veio de um comunicado de imprensa divulgado na calada da noite. Isso fez com que, de repente, a imprensa ficasse novamente interessada no Aquarius, e a pol\u00eamica sobre suas atividades reacendeu. Salvini imediatamente se pronunciou, afirmando que o Aquarius n\u00e3o seria bem-vindo de volta na It\u00e1lia, enquanto os pol\u00edticos su\u00ed\u00e7os e irlandeses pediram a seus governos que dessem ao navio de resgate a chance de continuar seu trabalho. No navio em si, reinava uma estranha sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de calma: a tripula\u00e7\u00e3o continuava com suas tarefas di\u00e1rias, cuidando das pessoas resgatadas \u2013 enquanto navegava sem rumo. Publicamente, o MSF e o SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e divulgaram uma declara\u00e7\u00e3o cuidadosamente redigida, culpando a remo\u00e7\u00e3o da bandeira pela intromiss\u00e3o do governo italiano. De forma privada, a tripula\u00e7\u00e3o \u2014 que inicialmente foi instru\u00edda a n\u00e3o falar com os rep\u00f3rteres sobre a situa\u00e7\u00e3o \u2014 se irritou. \"Isso \u00e9 uma piada. \u00c9 maluco\", disse Bridgham. \u201cNossa bandeira foi retirada, por qu\u00ea? Por raz\u00f5es pol\u00edticas, por press\u00f5es econ\u00f4micas? \u00c9 uma piada como um Estado pode ter tal controle sobre o outro.\u201d Salvini tuitou negando qualquer envolvimento. O Minist\u00e9rio do Interior italiano disse ao BuzzFeed News por e-mail: \"O Minist\u00e9rio do Interior jamais pediu nada \u00e0s autoridades do Panam\u00e1.\"\n\nChristophe Simon / AFP / Getty Images Uma demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o em apoio ao Aquarius depois que ele ficou preso no porto em outubro.\n\nEnquanto o navio navegava entre a L\u00edbia e as \u00e1guas europeias, os refugiados e migrantes come\u00e7aram a perguntar para onde estavam indo. \"Eles est\u00e3o todos com a impress\u00e3o de que logo estar\u00e3o na Europa\", disse Eldada, que, apesar de sua idade, est\u00e1 entre os membros mais antigos do Aquarius e \u00e9 a pessoa encarregada dos resgatados. \u201cEnt\u00e3o eles percebem: Ah... Agora minha fam\u00edlia vai pensar que me afoguei porque eu disse que entraria em contato em breve.\u201d Das \u00e1guas internacionais da L\u00edbia, o Aquarius geralmente leva cerca de quatro dias, com dois de seus quatro motores ligados, para alcan\u00e7ar \u00e1guas europeias. O navio tra\u00e7ou um curso para Malta \u2014 o porto europeu mais pr\u00f3ximo \u2014, mas n\u00e3o havia indica\u00e7\u00e3o de que os malteses os receberiam. \"E agora?\", perguntou F. repetidamente. \"Eu n\u00e3o consigo entender o que est\u00e1 acontecendo. [Mas] h\u00e1 chance de voltarmos? Eu n\u00e3o posso voltar.\" Finalmente com terra \u00e0 vista, as pessoas resgatadas foram informadas de que seriam levadas para Malta e ali divididas entre Alemanha, Portugal, Espanha e Fran\u00e7a. Mas o Aquarius n\u00e3o estava atracando. Em vez disso, ele come\u00e7ou a girar em c\u00edrculos enormes, enquanto uma enorme tempestade se aproximava. O humor piorou: havia a terra, havia a Europa, havia Malta. Por que eles n\u00e3o estavam atracando? \u201cA atmosfera \u00e9 bastante tensa quando o barco n\u00e3o est\u00e1 em movimento.

Now, two years later, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is almost here, and we\u2019re finally being blessed with even more information about J.K. Rowling\u2019s wizarding world. When BuzzFeed UK met with some of the cast of the series \u2014 Ezra Miller (Credence), Dan Fogler (Jacob), Claudia Kim (Nagini), Zo\u00eb Kravitz (Leta Lestrange), and Callum Turner (Theseus Scamander) \u2014 in London recently, the second film was still completely shrouded in secrecy. So we decided to challenge the stars to a little game of Would You Rather: Wizarding Edition. And now you can play along with them...\n\n1. Would you rather have to wear a super-tall wizard\u2019s hat every day for the rest of your life, or wear a wizard\u2019s cloak with every outfit?\n\nDan Fogler: [to Ezra] I know your answer. Ezra Miller: Both! I mean, if I was \u201crequired\u201d, it would give me an excuse. That would be useful for me performing neurotypical behaviours. Callum Turner: Some people actually do wear a wizard\u2019s hat every day. Brooklyn, Shoreditch. That stuff happens. Zo\u00eb Kravitz: I feel like I can wear different kinds of cloaks.

Three men were stabbed at the scene. One of them has died, and two others are still receiving medical treatment for non-life-threatening injuries, according to police.\n\nThe identity of the deceased man has not been publicly released. Police confirmed on Friday night that a fourth man, the suspected attacker, died in hospital after he was shot in the chest while being apprehended by police. Victoria Police Superintendent David Clayton said police had responded to reports of a ute going up in flames near the corner of Bourke and Swanston streets at about 4:20pm.\n\n\"As they got out of the car, they were confronted by a male brandishing a knife and threatening them,\" Clayton said. \"At the same time, passers-by were calling out that members of the public had been stabbed.\" There were gas cylinders of the type usually used for barbecues inside the ute, police say.\n\nJames Ross / AAPIMAGE\n\nVictoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said on Friday night that the attack was being treated as a \"terrorism incident\" and that the suspect was known to Victoria Police and to federal intelligence agencies, mainly due to his relatives. \"He's got family associations that are well known to us and, as a result of that, he's also known to us,\" Ashton said.\n\nAshton did not name the man, citing the ongoing counterterror investigation, but said he lived in Melbourne's northwestern suburbs, moved to Australia from Somalia in the 1990s, and had a minor criminal history relating to cannabis use, theft, and driving offences. He said police did not believe there was any ongoing threat, but there would be an increased police presence at public events in Melbourne over the weekend. \"Tonight, in fact, I think the Christmas windows have been open and there are a number of families in the city,\" he said. \"We have extra police there, as we will have over the weekend to just engage with the families, if they want to do that, to provide further reassurance at that time.\"\n\nSeveral videos being circulated on social media, filmed from a number of different angles, appear to show a man lunging at police before he is shot. They also show another person attempting to roll a trolley at the man. Some of the police officers who apprehended the man suffered minor injuries but are \"OK\", police said. Photographs from the scene show a body lying under a white sheet on the road with blood on the asphalt. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said the attack was an \"evil and terrifying thing\" and thanked the police and bystanders for their rapid response. \"They've done each and every one of us proud,\" he said. \"Equally, those strangers, people who were bystanders who knew nobody involved, who stepped in without a moment's hesitation, to render support and assistances to the brave members of the Victoria Police, they too ... make all of us proud as well.\"\n\nEmergency services are asking people to avoid the Bourke St Mall.

What did 0 say to 8? \"Nice belt.\" via devnodegree", "On November 21, 2016, 10 people in Victoria died from thunderstorm asthma attacks, a rare condition that results from a freak series of coinciding weather events.\n\nThe coroner's findings from an inquest this year have been released, detailing the events that led to the deaths.\n\nEpidemic thunderstorm asthma is triggered by a combination of uncommonly high amounts of ryegrass pollen (an introduced grass species), strong winds, high humidity and high temperatures. Thunderstorm asthma events are extremely rare globally but Melbourne is particularly vulnerable because of the vast grasslands that surround the city.\n\nGrass pollen, which contains starch particles, is picked up and carried by the winds, and when the pollen absorbs moisture from humidity or rain, the pieces explode, sending these starch particles deep into the lungs and causing extreme breathing difficulty.\n\nThe dangers of thunderstorm asthma are exacerbated when people are outside and breathing in more pollen particles.\n\n\n\nA history of asthma increases the risk of suffering from thunderstorm asthma, as does hay fever, but it can also strike in people who have never experienced respiratory issues before.\n\nThe coronial inquest into Melbourne's asthma thunderstorm deaths was told that ambulance requests stretched the emergency system to breaking point, with over 2,300 calls for medical help across the city.\n\n1,400 people also presented independently to emergency rooms across western Melbourne.\n\nThe people who died in the Melbourne thunderstorm from asthma attacks were:\n\nOmar-Jamil Moujalled, 18 years-old\n\n\n\nHope Marsh (also known as Hope Carnevali), 20 years-old\n\n\n\nMin Guo, 29 years-old\n\n\n\nApollo Papadopoulos, 35 years-old\n\n\n\nClarence Leo, 37 years-old\n\n\n\nLe Hue Huynh, 46 years-old\n\n\n\nLing-Ling Ang, 47 years-old\n\n\n\nThao La, 48 years-old\n\n\n\nHoi-Sam Lau, 49 years-old\n\n\n\nPriyantha Peiris, 57 years-old\n\n\n\nProfessor Jo Douglass, an allergy specialist from the University of Melbourne, told the coroner that for those who died, there was an average of 15 minutes from the onset of severe symptoms to when the patients entered cardiac arrest.\n\n\n\nVictorian coroner Paresa Antoniadis Spanos said in the hearings that many people suffering from asthma attacks were assured that the ambulances were on the way, when many were not. Hope Marsh's father told Seven News that the family wishes they had driven his daughter to the hospital themselves but instead the 20 year-old had died on the front lawn waiting for the ambulance.\n\nThe coronial report released today explores the series of events that led to the death of Moujalled, who had just completed his Year 12 studies and lived with his mother and three sisters. Moujalled was diagnosed with asthma at four years old.\n\nThe final report, written by Spanos, states that Ambulance Victoria have already made recommendations relating to public forewarning, preparation of the Emergency Services Telecommunication Authority (ESTA) or 000 phone line, and public hospitals.\n\n\n\nFor example, the script for 000 phone respondents has now been changed from \"the ambulance is on its way\" to \"help is being arranged\" with the intention that this will \"better equip callers with information to enable them to make independent decisions\" during these surging periods of callers.\n\nHowever, Spanos notes that the emergency system phone response needs to be more individualised and give callers an accurate estimation of ambulance arrival time.\n\nWhile Victoria now has an early warning system in place for thunderstorm asthma conditions, the report notes that this is a relatively new and untested system, and that it should be used sparingly so as not to desensitise the public.\n\nSpanos suggests that further research into thunderstorm asthma needs to be undertaken \"to improve our understanding of the phenomenon\" and \"our ability to predict which particular weather event has the potential to produce Thunderstorm Asthma\".\n\n\n\nThe report also notes that there needs to be more community understanding about hay fever, so that people can submit themselves to testing and be aware of their susceptibility to thunderstorm asthma.", "Did you know you can sign up for a BuzzFeed Community account and create your own BuzzFeed posts?

He claims publisher Nationwide News defamed him in two articles and a poster by painting him as a pervert, a sexual predator, and someone who engaged in inappropriate sexual behaviour and committed sexual assault while acting in King Lear. He also says the articles suggested his conduct was so serious that the STC pledged to never work with him again.\n\n\n\nNationwide News argued a defence of truth based on the testimony of Eryn Jean Norvill, who played the role of King Lear's daughter Cordelia in the production and alleges Rush sexually harassed her during the run of the play. Norvill did not participate in the stories and agreed at a late stage to testify for the Telegraph.\n\nRush\u2019s barrister Bruce McClintock SC said Rush\u2019s reputation was \"outstanding\" before the articles and they had caused him an \"absolutely immense\" amount of hurt.\n\nHe said there was a \u201csignificant risk\u201d Rush will not work again, due to the \"cloud\" of being associated with the #MeToo movement and the prospect he may never recover his confidence and desire to work.\n\n\"What they did to my client has disabled him from working,\" he said, saying there was evidence Mr Rush was a \"different man\" after the articles.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t take much of a taint to destroy a career,\" he added.", "Australians are not getting enough sleep and a parliamentary inquiry has been launched into how this huge public health problem can be addressed.\n\nAustralia is a very tired country and this has huge long-term health and economic consequences.\n\nNow a parliamentary inquiry into sleep health awareness, headed by Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman, has been launched following a referral by the minister for health, aged care and sport, Greg Hunt.\n\n\n\nThe parliamentary inquiry will hold public hearings beginning at the end of this month and file a report by early 2019.\n\n\n\nZimmerman told BuzzFeed News the inquiry will be investigating the effects of both long-term sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea, as well as general sleep deprivation.\n\n\"The committee had evidence that sleep problems are a growing and significant issue for many Australians, in fact, four out of 10 Australians are regularly reporting that they're not getting enough sleep,\" said Zimmerman.\n\nAccording to the 2016 Sleep Health Survey conducted by the Sleep Health Foundation, up to 45% of adults report that they're having inadequate sleep, and it is affecting how they function throughout the day.\n\nSleep health organisations recommend that adults get between seven and nine hours sleep a night, but 12% of Australian adults are getting less than five and a half hours a night. A representative from Mr Zimmerman's office told BuzzFeed News that the MP himself only gets five to six hours of sleep a night.\n\nThe average amount of sleep is on the tail end of the recommended amount, with most Australians having seven hours of sleep per night.\n\nSleep deficiency and sleep disorders are associated in the long-term with heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, and some types of cancer.\n\nLack of sleep also has a well-documented deteriorative effect on cognitive function. While it's fairly intuitive to think that sleep deprivation affects alertness and attention abilities, studies have found that brain functions such as creativity, emotional regulation, perception and memory are weakened as well when people don't get enough sleep.\n\nDr Alan Young, a physician on the board of the Australasian Sleep Association (ASA), told BuzzFeed News that there is also a concerning relationship between lack of sleep and mental health issues.\n\n\"There's a very strong interaction between depression, anxiety and disordered sleep, but the current thinking is that rather than one causing the other, they interact,\" he said.\n\nZimmerman believes that the far-reaching medical effects of not sleeping enough should make it a priority for how we understand health.\n\n\"We think we have a strong case for shining a light on the need for Australians to be thinking about sleep as much as they think about the other ... preconditions for a health lifestyle, being fitness and nutrition,\" said Zimmerman.", "Get all the best Tasty recipes in your inbox!
