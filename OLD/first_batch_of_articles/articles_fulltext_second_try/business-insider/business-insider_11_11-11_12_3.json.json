["The pundits predicted that a new content creator would be crowned YouTube's biggest star come November, but the title still belongs to the Swedish vlogger PewDiePie.\n\nPewDiePie became the first YouTuber to reach the 70-million subscriber mark, beating out the Indian music channel T-Series who has been quickly gaining ground. Research firms predicted that T-Series would overtake PewDiePie \u2014 who real name is Felix Kjellberg \u2014 by the end of October, but the content creator still led Monday by almost half a million subscribers.\n\nKjellberg has managed to keep his spot atop YouTube despite a history of making offensive remarks in his videos. Most recently, Kjellberg landed in hot water this summer over a (since deleted) Twitter post. Following Demi Lovato's hospitalization for an apparent drug overdose, Kjellberg tweeted out a comic that depicted Lovato asking her mom for money to buy a burger, then instead using it to buy heroin.\n\nAlthough his subscriber base has remained loyal throughout his controversial past, YouTube itself has punished the creator for his actions. News surfaced in February 2017 that nine videos published on PewDiePie's channel featured Kjellberg making anti-Semitic comments, and the video platform responded by cancelling the second season of Kjellberg's original series on YouTube Premium.\n\nRead more: PewDiePie criticizes YouTube's 'inept' leadership, accuses the company of giving Logan Paul a lighter punishment for offensive video\n\nThis sordid history hasn't stopped other YouTube influencers from calling on their fans to support Kjellberg in securing his spot atop YouTube. Tubefilter reports that fellow YouTube creator MrBeast campaigned heartily for Kjellberg through stints on local radio and purchases of advertisements on TV, websites, and billboards.\n\nIt's worth nothing that this title of \"YouTube's biggest star\" is based on the number of subscribers. Based on viewership, PewDiePie sits down at No. 7 on a leaderboard from research firm Social Blade. T-Series, however, leads all of YouTube in terms of viewership with more than 53 billion all-time video views.\n\nAs of Monday, Social Blade revised its estimates to predict that T-Series would overtake PewDiePie for the most subscribers on November 30.\n\nMeanwhile, PewDiePie posted on Twitter that he's already eyeing 100 million subscribers.", "On Saturday night, UFC hosted a fight for the ages between Yair Rodriguez and Chan Sung \"The Korean Zombie\" Jung in the main event of UFC Fight Night 139.\n\nOver the course of five rounds, the two fighters launched attack after brutal attack, but neither could find a way to end their opponent for good.\n\nWith the fight entering its closing seconds, it looked as though Jung had the win secured, having likely beaten Rodriguez on points if the bout was to go to a decision. But then, just two seconds before the final bell sounds, Rodriguez connected with a blindly thrown elbow that caught Jung right in the jaw and knocked him out.\n\nIt was as stunning an end to an already epic fight as you could have imagined.\n\nAfter the fight, UFC president Dana White called it the \"craziest finish ever\" when asked to put the last-second knockout in context of other dramatic endings in the history of the promotion.\n\n\"There was one second left on the clock when he landed that elbow,\" White said. \"Yair was losing 4-to-1. 'Zombie' had the fight in the bag, he had one second to go and, wow, what a finish.\"\n\nBoth fighters were hospitalized after the fight, but seemed in good spirits, even sharing a photo as they recovered together.\n\n\"This is how #MMA is treated,\" Rodriguez wrote in the caption. \"@koreanzombiemma is a warrior. I am honored to have had the opportunity to fight against you, this has been the toughest fight I have ever had and the most significant one as well. @koreanzombiemma you recover soon warrior!\"\n\nHopefully, these two recover quickly because there's surely room for a rematch if UFC wants to book it.", "Former first lady Michelle Obama's mother gave her a key piece of perspective at a turning point in her career.\n\nTown & Country on Monday published an interview between Oprah Winfrey and Obama, whose new memoir, \"Becoming,\" is set to be released Tuesday.\n\nThe women discussed the former first lady's journey from her working-class upbringing on the South Side of Chicago to becoming a lawyer, and Obama described her sense of pushing herself on a particular life path:\n\n\"In the book, I take you on the journey of who that little striving star-getter became, which is what a lot of hard-driving kids become: a box checker. Get good grades: check. Apply to the best schools, get into Princeton: check. Get there, what's your major? Uh, something that's going to get me good grades so I can get into law school, I guess? Check. Get through law school: check.\"\n\nObama did not enjoy her time in a law firm. Winfrey quoted Obama as saying in her memoir that she \"hated being a lawyer.\"\n\nObama described her feelings of doubt about her career path: \"I wasn't a swerver. I wasn't somebody that was going to take risks. I narrowed myself to being this thing I thought I should be.\"\n\nRead more: Michelle Obama says 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' is the worst question you can ask a kid\n\nObama said she remembered the moment she confided in her mother about disliking her job, in which she spent much of her time doing document production.\n\n\"So I shared with her in the car: I'm just not happy. I don't feel my passion,\" Obama said. \"And my mother \u2014 my uninvolved, live-and-let-live mother \u2014 said, 'Make the money, worry about being happy later.' I was like [gulps], Oh. OK.

It was hard.\"\n\nEventually, she met her husband, Barack Obama, who she said was \"the opposite of a box checker.\"\n\n\"He was swerving all over the place,\" she said.\n\nThe interview and Michelle Obama's memoir include several other intimate details of her path to the White House, including about her early relationship with her husband and the challenges she faced in conceiving her children.", "Palantir\u2014 a Silicon Valley-based analytics company credited with helping the United States find Osama bin Laden \u2014 is trying to tamp down on its culture of corporate spending ahead of a 2020 IPO, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Monday.\n\nDubbed the \"Palantir Entitlement Syndrome,\" Palantir employees have become accustomed to next-level corporate extravagance, like 13-course tasting-menu lunches at its headquarters complete with lobster tails and sashimi, according to the report.\n\nWhen perks have been threatened by management in the past, employees have resisted en masse, according to the report. The Journal reports that a companywide debate broke out after artisanal bacon was nixed from the breakfast menu, in an incident known internally as \"bacongate.\"\n\nHowever, as Palantir, last valued at $20 billion, seeks to reach profitability in 2019 and eyes a potential public offering in 2020, the 14-year-old company has reportedly begun reeling in some of its spending.\n\nRead more: Mysterious big data company Palantir is reportedly looking at an IPO \u2014 and could see a valuation of $41 billion\n\nAccording to the Journal, Palantir has started letting go of some of its office space and slowed its hiring of engineers.

Now I'm going to have to go to prison the rest of my life because I dared to oppose the deep state.\"\n\nCorsi was served a subpoena in August by Mueller to testify before a grand jury. Mueller was reportedly investigating whether Corsi had prior knowledge of the Hillary Clinton campaign's hacked emails \u2014 which were later delivered to and published online by secrets-leaking organization WikiLeaks \u2014 and whether he passed those emails on to Stone.\n\nStone, a GOP strategist and former adviser to Donald Trump, was under scrutiny by the special counsel for his connection with Julian Assange, WikiLeaks' founder, and Guccifer 2.0, an online identity believed to be part of the Russia's military-intelligence arm.\n\nResponding to reports that Corsi will be indicted, Stone cast doubt on Mueller's investigation and indicated that the special counsel does not have enough proof against him or Corsi. He pointed out that he has taken two polygraph tests and passed both. He also said his attorneys have reviewed all his written communications with the far-right commentator.\n\n\"When those aren't viewed out of context they prove everything I have said under oath regarding my interaction with Dr. Corsi is true,\" Stone said. \"It is possible to take individual communications out of context to create a false impression to a grand jury. Such a case would be weak and would fail. I stand by my statement to the House Intelligence Committee and can prove it is truthful if need be.\"\n\nStone added: \"Watching his podcast, Dr. Corsi strikes me as a man who has been squeezed hard but refuses to do anything but tell the truth which is why they may be indicting him.\"\n\nJerome Corsi. Charles Sykes/AP Images\n\nFederal prosecutors indicted 12 Russian military officers for the hack in July and provided evidence that connected WikiLeaks' ties to Guccifer 2.0.\n\nCorsi, formerly the Washington bureau chief of conspiracy-theory-website InfoWars, suggested Mueller had material evidence for his case.\n\n\"When they have your emails and phone records ... they're very good at the perjury trap,\" Corsi said to NBC producer Anna Schecter.\n\nIn 2016, days before a trove of emails were leaked, Stone made several statements on Twitter that eventually attracted attention from investigators. Stone previously tweeted \"it will soon [be] Podesta's time in the barrel,\" in reference to John Podesta, Clinton's embattled campaign manager, whose emails were breached.\n\nCorsi later claimed to be the inspiration behind Stone's tweets that suggested Podesta's brewing troubles. One person familiar with the situation said Mueller's team was reviewing communications with Trump's associates, in which Corsi and Stone appeared to take credit for the release of the hacked emails, according to NBC News. The source added that there has yet to be evidence of their potential involvement in the email's hack or subsequent release to the public.\n\nCorsi denied having prior knowledge of the emails. Stone reportedly described his alleged ties with Russia as a \"left-wing conspiracy theory\" and claimed Corsi did not tip him off about WikiLeaks' possession of the emails prior to its public release.\n\n\"For the record, I have never had any communication of any kind with Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, or Guccifer 2.0, or any Russian agents of any kind, including those mythical Russian agents who the Democrats believe wanted to throw the election for Trump,\" Corsi reportedly wrote on InfoWars in March 2017.", "California has been overtaken by a string of deadly wildfires, which continue to blaze in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties in the southern part of the state and around the town of Paradise, California in the north.\n\nSince the fires began on November 8, the wealthy coastal enclave of Malibu has been engulfed by the Woolsey Fire, which has spread across more than 96,000 acres of land outside of LA and is now 35% contained.

Before news of the contracts ending, the dealers had also increasingly been directed to prioritize selling AT&T mobility products (phones and related plans) alongside video and broadband products where no previous directive existed, the dealer said.\n\nThe changing business strategies in the unit may be another indication that three years after its $50 billion acquisition of DirecTV, the telco behemoth is still struggling to stabilize that part of its business.\n\nAT&T isn't alone in its pay-TV troubles.\n\nThe pay-TV business got clobbered during the quarter, as the industry reported its worst quarter to date and for the first time lost more than 1 million subscribers. AT&T lost 346,000 traditional video subscribers in the third quarter of 2018, faring worse than Wall Street analysts had projected.\n\nThe story isn't much different for AT&T than for other traditional-linear-television providers. Disruptive companies like Netflix and YouTube have spurred a cord-cutting revolution, offering cheaper or more customizable options. Cable and satellite companies have fought back with burgeoning virtual multichannel video programming distributor packages, or vMVPDs, that aim to retain customers by shifting them from traditional to digital within the same company (DirecTV, for example).\n\nAT&T has an vMVPD option called DirecTV Now. But growth could already be slowing, as the company added only 49,000 DirecTV Now subscribers in the third quarter, a substantial decline in growth compared to the 342,000 added subscribers the quarter before.\n\nIf you have any thoughts or information on DirecTV, AT&T, or the future of cable and satellite TV, contact ajackson@businessinsider.com.", "Insider Inc. has a number of editorial openings across both Business Insider and INSIDER.

And yet, it still feels like a random experiment instead of the next mainstream video game. You'd think after nearly two decades of calling it the future, it'd be better, but it's not.\n\nSo why does virtual reality still suck? First, the cost. Virtual reality is an expensive commitment.\n\nKevin Webb: Right now the cost of entry for virtual reality is around $400 or $500 once you factor in all the different devices and games and whatnot. There are some new machines coming up, like the Oculus Quest that can make it a little bit easier, or the Samsung VR, that's a bit cheaper. But overall, you're probably gonna be in the range of $500.\n\nMichelle Yan: And that's just for entry-level models. If you're looking for something super powerful like the Vive Pro Starter Kit, you're looking at least $1,000, if not more.\n\nAnd then there's the annoying setup. Most of these devices aren't something you can just plug into a power outlet and be on your way.\n\nKevin Webb: You have the Vive that can take a full room with sensors all around you. You have the PlayStation VR which has extra cameras and sensor bars, and even specific controllers for it. And then even the Gear VR can burn up your phone's battery if you use it for too long. Setting up a virtual reality experience on your own can be kind of a hassle. It just takes a lot of time. And even once you've spent it, you might not know what you wanna do.\n\nMichelle Yan: And once you do finally figure out what games to play or how else to use it, this isn't like your PS4 or Xbox where you can binge for hours on end.\n\nKevin Webb: The VR headsets that are available right now are a bit cumbersome and heavy. And spending too much time in virtual reality can be disorienting, so wearing the headset for more than half an hour can leave your head spinning when you take it off.\n\nRight now Facebook is recommending that people take a 10 to 15 minute break for every 30 minutes that they play. That means, even if you wanna spend an hour in virtual reality, about 20 minutes of that will just be cooling off.\n\nMichelle Yan: Not to mention, virtual reality is very platform specific.\n\nKevin Webb: If you purchase a game that requires the sensors and controllers of the HTC Vive, for example, you might not be able to carry it over to future technology. Most of the games that we see in VR right now are pretty basic compared to what you see on a video game console or even your smartphone.\n\nEven the best games that have been in VR, like \"Resident Evil 7\" or \"Superhot VR\" are available on regular computers so there's not much of a reason just to go to VR to play.\n\nMichelle Yan: And games made for something like the PlayStation VR won't be playable on other headsets and vice versa. Right now almost any game you buy for one platform won't work on any other platforms. That makes it harder for virtual reality to be a shared experience, which is another problem.\n\nKevin Webb: With a video game or a movie that you're really excited about it's easy to bring that and share it with friends. You're all seeing and experiencing the same thing. But when it comes to virtual reality, you can be sitting with someone in the same room who's in VR and it just feels like you're worlds apart.\n\nCompanies like Facebook are working on programs that will let you share virtual reality with friends, but it's hard to see why that might beat out something like FaceTime or just regular video calling.\n\nMichelle Yan: We've seen things like VR arcades, VR escape rooms, and even VR Ghostbusters that have been trying to make the experience more shared. But those require going somewhere and paying an admission cost for a small 10 to 15 minute experience.\n\nSo what can VR platforms do to become more successful?\n\nKevin Webb: For VR to really catch on, it needs to offer something that feels totally exclusive to virtual reality. Whether it's immersive environments or different ways to interact with your friends. It needs to have a reason to make people put on that headset.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

But Dorsey expressed concerns over users abusing such a feature by changing the meanings of old tweets, which could have widespread implications for anyone who retweeted or favorited the post.\n\n\"Ultimately, we need to make sure we're solving a real problem and solving a use case that people are seeing as friction within the service, and making that easy for people to do,\" Dorsey said.\n\nRead more: Kim Kardashian says she personally lobbied Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for the ability to edit tweets\n\nThis is the first time that Dorsey has touched on the topic since 2016, when the CEO said on his Twitter account that the company was \"thinking a lot about it,\" Recode reported then. However nothing ever came to fruition.\n\nSocial media has instead campaigned for the change with the rallying cry \"tweets, but editable\" that users will often add onto typo-ridden posts they've already sent out. Kim Kardashian tried her own hand at lobbying for this cause in June, when she posted on Twitter she had confronted Dorsey at a birthday party for her husband Kanye West.", "Victoria's Secret came under fire late last week after one of its executives was called out for making \"insensitive\" comments during an interview with Vogue.\n\nEd Razek, chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands, said he didn't think the company's annual fashion show should feature \"transsexuals\" because \"the show is a fantasy.\"\n\n\"It's a 42-minute entertainment special. That's what it is,\" he said. \"It is the only one of its kind in the world, and any other fashion brand in the world would take it in a minute, including the competitors that are carping at us.\"\n\nHe also said Victoria's Secret would not be adding larger sizes to its assortment and has no plans to feature plus-size models in its runway show.\n\n\"We attempted to do a television special for plus-sizes [in 2000].

The New York Times' Marc Stein reported on Sunday that though it wasn't official, Anthony had likely played his last game with the Rockets.\n\nAnthony and the Rockets have gotten off to a sluggish start. Anthony is averaging 13 points and 5 rebounds per game while shooting 40% from the field and 32% from three while the Rockets are just 5-7, a far cry from their play last season when they won 65 games.\n\nIf the Rockets do indeed move on from Anthony, it will send the 34-year-old looking for a fourth team in less than two years. Anthony was traded from the New York Knicks to the Oklahoma City Thunder before the start of last season. This summer, the Thunder traded Anthony to the Atlanta Hawks, who then bought him out, allowing him to sign with the Rockets.\n\nIf Anthony is nearing the end of his career, at 34, in his 16th season, it shouldn't be a surprise. Anthony has over 1,100 games under his belt and played over 38,000 regular-season minutes. Only a few unique players manage to make it beyond that mark and still thrive in the league.\n\nBut in some ways, this late, ugly turn in Anthony's career only makes his peak years more bitter. Anthony is at the stage of his career when he should be playing a role on a good team, seeking out that elusive championship. Instead, it appears that his best skills are no longer applicable in today's NBA, and his inability to adapt has made him an outcast.\n\nIt only reinforces the feeling that Anthony left something on the table during his peak years, when he never really came close to contending for a ring.\n\nMary Altaffer/AP\n\nAnthony never realized his full talents\n\nAt his peak, Anthony was a bulldozing offensive force with a rare combination of speed, strength, and finesse. Few players in NBA history have possessed Anthony's ability to get a basket. To talk about Anthony's peak as some kind of disappointment would surely strike some as odd. He's a top-20 all-time scorer, a 10-time All-Star, six-time All-NBA team member, and likely Hall of Famer.\n\nBut the way Anthony plied his trade hurt him in the long run. Anthony was at his best in the midrange and post, holding the ball, sizing up his opponent, then making his move. Sometimes that would be with a deceptively quick, blow-by step to the basket. Other times, it was with a quick move to his right or left, creating just enough separation to get off his shot. And sometimes, he just rose up in the face of a defender and hit shots in a maddeningly unguardable way.\n\nBut most frequently, it came while bringing the offense to a halt, leaving his teammates standing around and watching.\n\nA compilation of every made field goal of Anthony's career would have a lot of plays like this:\n\nAnthony's scoring prowess often came at the expense of his other skills. He was often indifferent to defense, but capable when he tried. He's always been a solid rebounder but could have been elite, as evidenced by a stretch in the 2013-14 season when he averaged double-digit boards for the Knicks.\n\nBut most of all, Anthony was a gifted passer who didn't want to give up the ball very much. He owns, (in this writer's opinion) one of the cooler passes of all-time. Anthony had the vision and touch to make outstanding passes when he wanted.\n\nAt times, Anthony even blended his face-up game with his court vision, seeking out three-point shooters like a quarterback in the pocket finding his receivers.\n\nBut either because of a desire to score, a lack of trust in his teammates, or a lack of understanding, Anthony never committed to being the type of playmaker he could be. He averaged over four assists per game just once in his career. As a player who commanded the attention of entire defenses, Anthony probably could have racked up far more assists than he did, and his teams would have benefitted as a result.\n\n'Olympic Melo' never came to fruition\n\nIn basketball circles, there existed a version of Carmelo Anthony called \"Olympic Melo.\" Olympic Melo torched teams overseas with USA Basketball, acting as a spot-up shooter who did not have to do the offensive lifting himself \u2014 he could finish plays instead of creating them. The world saw peak Olympic Melo when he scored 37 points in 14 minutes against Nigeria in the 2012 Olympics.\n\nExcept, when Anthony got the opportunity in the NBA, he didn't become \"Olympic Melo.\" He shot just 40% from the field and 35% from three last season with the Thunder, failing to become the necessary third weapon behind Russell Westbrook and Paul George.\n\nAfter the season, he didn't seem thrilled with the role, either, even though he accepted it.\n\nMatthew Stockman/Getty \"I don't think I can be effective as that type of player,\" Anthony said of playing a smaller role after last season. \"I think I was willing to accept that challenge in that role, but I think I bring a little bit more to the game as far as being more knowledgeable and what I still can do as a basketball player.\"\n\nThe Rockets appeared to be gambling that they could be the team to turn Anthony into Olympic Melo. When given a chance, especially for a group that emphasizes three-point shooting, Anthony couldn't connect. His best skills don't jibe with what Houston emphasizes, a fact that seemed clear from the start.\n\nRead more: Carmelo Anthony's move to the Rockets comes with a role he's already complained about\n\nNow older and a step slower, Anthony is also routinely targeted on defense.\n\nThe Rockets insisted in recent days that Anthony did everything that was asked of him, from a role-playing standpoint. He seems more willing to embrace that he's not the No. 1 or even the No. 2 option on a good team anymore.\n\nNow seemingly heading for the open market, there's risk of a snowball effect. How many teams want to sign up for what Anthony brings \u2014 the occasional ability to get a basket, spotty three-point shooting, slow-footed defense, even when he's engaged? Anthony still has his moments, and he can be a serviceable player, but how many teams will go out of their way to sign such a player? That two borderline contenders have now said, \"No thanks,\" must surely raise some eyebrows on other teams.\n\nAnthony may yet still find a fit in the NBA. It's worth considering the adjustment he's had to make in recent years. It takes players time to get used to systems, roles, and teammates. Anthony may have needed more time with the Thunder; for the Rockets to conclude he's not a good fit after 12 games, is borderline shocking.\n\nBut as Anthony grows increasingly desperate for a fit and a last shot at a championship, it's hard not to think that his peak years, when his full talents could have led a team to a championship, were spoiled.", "When MoviePass was forced to drastically change its business model in the face of mounting losses in August, competitor Sinemia stepped into the spotlight.\n\nThe movie-ticket subscription startup was founded in Turkey in 2015 and had operated overseas, but in early 2018 it capitalized on the hype around MoviePass to launch in the US. Despite their similarities, Sinemia CEO Rifat Oguz positioned his company as the anti-MoviePass, focused on \"profit\" and \"sustainability\" where MoviePass was focused on hypergrowth.\n\nBut as MoviePass began to introduce unpopular new restrictions, Sinemia went for the jugular, introducing a plan at the same price as MoviePass (around $10 per month), with the same number of movies (three per month), but with no restrictions on movies or showtimes \u2014 and with the ability to book tickets in advance.\n\nFor some movie fans, including myself, it seemed we had finally found a subscription service we could rely on. That feeling didn't last for many.\n\nOn Friday, the law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP filed a class action lawsuit in Delaware on behalf of two plaintiffs, alleging that Sinemia \"essentially became a bait-and-switch scheme.\"\n\n\"It lures consumers in by convincing them to purchase a purportedly cheaper movie subscription, and then adds undisclosed fees that make such purchases no bargain at all,\" the lawsuit claims. \"Sinemia fleeces consumers with an undisclosed, unexpected, and not-bargained-for processing fee each time a plan subscriber goes to the movies using Sinemia's service.\"\n\nI, too, encountered Sinemia's sneaky fees and wrote about them in a piece published last week. In the piece, I urged the company to be more transparent with customers about its pricing structure. After the article published, I was contacted by over 40 Sinemia subscribers, many of whom expressed anger and frustration with its fees and lack of customer service.\n\nOn Sunday, less than a week after my story, Sinemia deactivated my personal account without explanation. A button to \"reactivate\" my subscription didn't function and my email to customer support hasn't been answered. Despite paying a $20 activation fee, my account was only active for two months before Sinemia shut it off.\n\nI saw one movie, \"A Star Is Born,\" which I highly recommend.\n\nHow did it all go so wrong so quickly?\n\nFees upon fees\n\nThe crux of the class action lawsuit against Sinemia is a new $1.80 \"processing fee\" that the company began to roll out in mid-October.\n\nTo understand how the new fee changes the value proposition of the service, it's helpful to look at one of the lawsuit plaintiffs: Paul Early of California.\n\nEarly signed up for Sinemia in August and paid $191.88 for a year plan of two movies per month for two people, plus $9.99 for early activation, according to the suit. All in he paid over $200. The first five times Early used Sinemia, he incurred a $1.50 third-party \"convenience fee\" (from using ticketing sites like Fandango). Sinemia had disclosed before he'd bought the subscription that he'd have to pay that fee.\n\nBut then when Early went to use the app on October 22, he was charged a further $1.80 \"processing fee\" per ticket, according to the suit.\n\nAfter getting hit with this new fee a few more times, Early contacted customer support asking to cancel his plan and get a refund for the remainder. He never heard anything, according to the suit.\n\n\"The movie plan Early is now stuck with has lost significant value with the imposition of the processing fees,\" the suit argues.\n\nMany Sinemia subscribers echoed these sentiments to Business Insider, saying they felt taken advantage of by the fees, especially when \"processing fees\" were added on top of \"convenience fees.\" Multiple subscribers said they had requested refunds for the remainder of their yearly subscriptions and been told Sinemia was a \"non-refundable service.\"\n\nOthers simply never heard from Sinemia's customer support despite multiple follow-ups (including myself).\n\nSinemia provided the following statement to Business Insider after publication:\n\n\"From the beginning, the goal of Sinemia has been to make the moviegoing experience much more affordable and enjoyable for moviegoers by covering for the cost of the movie ticket. While nobody enjoys fees, there are certain costs related to booking and processing outside of the price of the movie ticket that are out of our control. A processing fee of up to $1.80 applies so that Sinemia can continue to provide access to all showtimes for all movies in all theaters without restrictions as well as to keep our subscription plans and services consistent, as they have been since the founding of the company. Also, Sinemia is developing a feature in the app which will allow users to order physical cards in December or earlier.\"\n\nIf you have any information about Sinemia, or have a story about your experience with the service, contact the author at nmcalone@businessinsider.com.", "Stan Lee (L) talks to Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) in \"Spider-Man 3.\" Sony/Marvel/\"Spider-Man 3\" With the passing of Stan Lee on Monday at the age of 95, we don't just say goodbye to the face of the Marvel brand, but also the man of 1,000 cameos.\n\nThe former president and chairman of Marvel Comics is known by many Marvel Cinematic Universe fans as the guy who shows up in the majority of the movies released by Marvel Studios since 2008's \"Iron Man.\" But he started doing cameos long before there were superhero movies. Going as far back as the 1960s, Lee's likeness would be inserted occasionally in covers and inside the pages of the Marvel comics he was overseeing. And from what Lee told Business Insider back in 2015, it was never his intention to pop up in all things Marvel.\n\n\"The artists back then would draw me in as a joke or just to have fun,\" Lee told Business Insider then. \"And I would put some dialogue balloons there and it looked as if I intended it. I didn't try to do cameos in those days.\"\n\nHere's Lee and fellow iconic Marvel artist Jack Kirby showing up on the cover of a \"Fantastic Four\" comic in the 1960s. Wikipedia/Marvel And Lee shows up in this edition of the \"Nova\" comics in the 1990s. Cyber Space Comics/Marvel \"Anything that seemed fun and anything that the readers seemed to enjoy we kept doing and those things brought in a lot of fan mail,\" Lee recalled. \"And we weren't doing movies or television, our whole existence depended on comic books, so if you see that something is interesting to the fans you stay with it.\"\n\nMarvel definitely stayed with it, making Lee the face of the company. Over the decades, he also appeared in countless cartoons, TV shows, and movies ranging from Fox's '90s cartoon \"Spider-Man\" to 1995 comedy \"Mallrats\" where Kevin Smith used him as a voice of reason. Lee in the final episode of the cartoon TV series \"Spider-Man.\" Fox/Marvel/\"Spider-Man\" (1994) Lee said he particularly liked his cameo in 2015's \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" because \"it's so funny.\"\n\nThat's primarily why he also has a fondness for his appearance in 2007's \"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,\" in which he can't get into the wedding of Reed Richards and Susan Storm because the bouncer doesn't think he's really Stan Lee. \"I like any of them that seem a little bit funny,\" he added.

By voting together, they could negotiate harder stances with House Speaker Paul Ryan. But with the GOP's losses in the midterm elections last Tuesday, the Freedom Caucus members will be a part of the minority party for the first time in the group's history.\n\nRead more:Paul Ryan's successor will have to deal with a lot of pent-up anger in the GOP conference\n\nThe Freedom Caucus' chairman, North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, acknowledged in an October interview with Roll Call that it would be \"our advantage to keep the majority.\"\n\n\"Because then, what puts something across the top could be Democrat votes, not Republican votes,\" Meadows added. \"There would be no Republican-only scenario. However, if you have 40 or 50 Freedom Caucus members, a number of the other [Republican Study Committee] members will look to form coalitions with the Freedom Caucus to encourage the administration to look at more conservative policy.\"\n\nAnd because of Democrats taking the majority, HFC members are now likely to be shut out of any leadership roles. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a founding HFC member and former chairman, had initially announced a bid to run for speaker of the House when Paul Ryan retired. Jordan pivoted to a minority leader run just after the election, but now his prospects are even more dim than his original long shot bid.\n\nInstead, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has emerged as the frontrunner to be the next minority leader, followed by Rep. Steve Scalise as minority whip. In addition, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming is running for House GOP Conference chair unopposed, and North Carolina Rep. Mark Walker is doing the same for the vice chair position.\n\nWith the minority leader position being decided among the GOP conference and not on the House floor, Republican aides told INSIDER they are confident in McCarthy's ability to easily win the the top spot. What was once a hot race with multiple people vying for support and perhaps most importantly, the blessing of President Donald Trump, is now a fairly simple decision for Republicans.\n\nDespite GOP's widespread losses, the House added several new conservative members\n\nDespite Republicans getting trounced in many races across the country, HFC recruits managed to pick up several seats in the midterm elections.\n\nIncoming freshmen Republicans like Mark Harris in North Carolina expressed openness to joining the group, telling Spectrum News, \"I can't say that that final decision is there until I exactly understand what that means, but certainly I would be looking that direction.\"\n\n\"I've had a great deal of respect from day one for their seriousness with which they approach fiscal responsibility,\" Harris added.\n\nSeveral other new Republicans who benefitted from the House Freedom Fund \u2014 the HFC's PAC \u2014 won their races in primarily deep-red districts, which could further add to their numbers.\n\nDespite being in the minority, the personal associations of many HFC members with President Trump could prove advantageous for the politically weakened group.\n\nUnlike most past presidents, Trump has many unique relationships with Republicans in Congress. Trump talks with members after they give fiery defenses of him on television and even maintains candid friendships with Republicans in the rank and file.\n\nHaving Trump's ear during budget talks and other negotiations on must-pass legislation comes with significant advantages, particularly for the more conservative members of the Republican caucus who have been frustrated with rules and process under Ryan's tenure.\n\n\"So you've got this frustration of members that they can't offer amendments, which is a problem for them personally, then you've got the committee chairmen that are disempowered, but then the way that you run this, the whole body is disempowered really,\" FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon told INSIDER in an August interview.", "Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015. Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nWhen a company offered to buy Ryan Smith's startup Qualtrics for more than $500 million in the early 2010's, he asked his wife to take a drive.\n\nThe deal, and the amount of money it would net his family, was a lot to process. But after just 30 minutes of driving south, the couple decided to turn it down.\n\nThey felt earning so much money at once could negatively impact the way they were raising their children. And although Smith had been running his business for nearly a decade, he had gotten good at balancing both work and his personal life, so being an entrepreneur wasn't a major strain on his family.\n\nTogether, the Smiths decided to keep Ryan's 800-person survey company private \u2014 at least until now, as SAP announced it was buying Qualtrics in an all-cash deal for $8 billion, just days before the company was set to IPO.\n\nIt wasn't always easy for Smith to feel successful at both home and work. He, like many executives, uses a CEO coach to help him keep things balanced. He likens work-life balance to a plane that can easily go lopsided and constantly needs to be stabilized. One wing represents his family's needs, the other the needs of his work. When he's on a business trip, for example, one side of the plane tilts down. When he returns to his family and clears out the weekend for his children, it's tilted back up.\n\nSmith's CEO coach taught him a way to plan for success that can be implemented every week. He described it to a group of fellow CEOs at a conference in Ireland in 2014.\n\nThe coach asked him which jobs he was responsible for. Smith replied that he was:\n\nA husband A father A son A CEO A boss A sibling A grandson A friend\n\nThe CEO coach then asked him what he could do for each job that week to make him feel successful. He noted that if he took his wife on a date and bought her a surprise bouquet of flowers, that might make him feel like a good husband. And if he taught his daughter to ride a bike, he would feel like a better dad.\n\nRyan Smith describes work-life balance as a plane that constantly needs to be stabilized. Flickr/Daniel Gies He also found that he could combine tasks on his list to achieve everything quickly. If he was really productive, every task written on Sunday could be accomplished by Tuesday.\n\nFor example, if he took his daughter to his parent's house and taught her to ride a bike in their cul-de-sac, he could be both a good father and son.\n\nSo Smith's weekly job list began to look something like this:\n\nA husband - Take wife to dinner and buy her flowers A father - Teach daughter to ride a bike A son - Visit parents. Combine tasks 2 & 3.\n\nSmith learned that people often plan for one phase of life (\"I'm going to sell my company by the time I turn 30.\") But they either don't know which steps to take to achieve that goal, or they don't plan what to do after the goal has been achieved.\n\nHis CEO coach's plan breaks daunting life goals into weekly tasks, so people don't wake up one day and realized they've let major priorities slip.\n\nShortly after Smith explained this success tactic on Friday evening, he left the conference. Others stayed out late and partied at a local pub, but Smith drove 3 hours to Dublin and booked an early flight home to Utah. That way, when his children woke up on Sunday morning, they'd be able to spend all day with their father.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nThe Weston Laptop Bag in Dark Moss Dagne Dover Instagram\n\nI wish I could carry my favorite leather tote bag to work \u2014 but frankly, it's impractical. Though the style is classic, the thin straps are too weak to carry the weight of my day's worth of supplies and the wide-open interior leaves much to be desired in terms of organization. It's a dilemma commuters and professionals alike know all too well \u2014 struggling to find a bag that strikes the balance between comfort and practicality, with a look that still exudes an air of professionalism.\n\nWhile I'm not planning on giving up my favorite leather tote anytime soon, I will be retiring it to weekend duty in favor of something a little more practical.\n\nLuckily, I didn't have to search far to find a perfect, work-appropriate bag. My team has already sung the praises of Dagne Dover, a brand that makes intelligently designed bags for professional women, and men, who value both fashion and function. The brand already has a running list of commuter-friendly bags, including a carry-all gym bag, a professional leather tote, and a work-appropriate backpack, among others.\n\nSleek materials, aesthetically pleasing designs, and smart features are the signature of the Dagne Dover 365 collection, including its two newest additions \u2014 the Ryan and Weston Laptop Bags.\n\nBoth the Ryan and Weston are made with neoprene (the same material used to make wetsuits for scuba diving), and come in a range of rich neutral colors. The combination of the distinct-looking fabric with a style that resembles a briefcase creates an appealing aesthetic that passes in both formal and casual environments, truly embodying the purpose of the 365 collection. While the unique style is what might draw customers to these laptop bags at first, it is the superior organization and additional specs that will keep them coming back to Dagne Dover.\n\nGiven their names, one of the most prominent features of the Ryan and the Weston is the interior laptop sleeve, but there is so much more.\n\nThere's the exterior pocket that's perfect for keeping your phone or wallet almost concealed, but at arm's reach when you need it on the subway. Then there's the interior card slots, the key leash, and the mesh pockets that provide a spot for just about every little thing you'll need throughout the day. Plus, each bag is water resistant so you know your precious tech will be safe (remember, scuba gear!)\n\nBoth bags have a regular handle, as well as a crossbody strap, so you can carry it whatever way you find most comfortable. While most features are the same between the models, the most noticable difference is that the Ryan has an exterior zipper pocket, while the Weston has a slimmer, flat exterior. Both bags come in medium and large sizes. The medium's laptop sleeve is 13.25\" inches wide, while the large's is 14.5\" inches wide, so they can accomodate a range of laptop sizes.\n\nThree of our team members got to test Dagne Dover's new laptop bags. While some of us were already fans of the brand, some of us (like myself) had never tried anything from Dagne Dover before, but it's safe to say, regardless of our prior experience, we were all impressed.\n\nKeep reading to check out our experiences with the Ryan and Weston bags:\n\nThe Ryan Laptop Bag in Heather Grey Dagne Dover Instagram\n\nConnie Chen, Insider Picks reporter:\n\nI wish the Dagne Dover Ryan Laptop Bag had existed while I was in college, because it would've actually held up to all the heavy study materials and the laptop I carried around campus. I liked that I could carry it multiple ways \u2014 in one hand, over the shoulder, cross-body, or over my luggage handle \u2014 and it felt sturdy and comfortable all the while. Since it features so many well-organized compartments for notebooks, smaller tech, and even my keys, it's the only bag I need to carry if I want to bring some work home or to a cafe.\n\nMara Leighton, Insider Picks reporter:\n\nDagne Dover's laptop bag, like much of its offerings, is smarter, leaner, and better looking than most other options. It's spacious enough for my laptop, planner, headphones, keys, and other essentials, but compact enough to be forgettable even in a crowded subway car.\n\nThe neoprene is lightweight but sturdy, and being able to carry it like a crossbody or purse is essential. My favorite features are the key leash, lean build, and almost hidden exterior pocket for easy access to my phone or wallet. My only complaint is that I found the medium size's laptop sleeve to be a little snug for the MacBook I use for work, but that's ultimately not a big deal.\n\nThe Weston Laptop Bag in Dark Moss Dagne Dover Instagram\n\nRemi Rosmarin, Insider Picks intern:\n\nI was super excited to test the large Weston Laptop Bag after hearing such great things about Dagne Dover from my coworkers. While I'm more partial to the style of backpacks and totes, this bag won me over. I was worried that, as an intern, I might look silly carrying what looks like a briefcase. In all honesty, carrying this on the subway and into the office gave me an air of confidence that only such a professional-looking bag could provide. Still, I was able to bring it to the gym without worrying that a wet locker room floor would ruin it (thanks, neoprene!)\n\nMost importantly, this bag feels like it was designed with every one of my commuter frustrations in mind. The key leash, smartphone-sized back pocket, and multiple organizational slots keep my bag organized, making it easy to find everything and eliminating all that wasted time rummaging through a stuffed, messy bag.", "Deadly fires have engulfed communities across California in recent days.\n\nThe Camp Fire in northern California has killed at least 29 people and destroyed more than 6,400 homes, making it the most destructive wildfire in the state's history.

Most home studios have humble beginnings, in a basement or in a kitchen. But if a streamer becomes successful, they soon need a set-up capable of an increasingly high level of production to serve a growing audience.\n\nThe world's most popular gamer, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, has nearly 20 million subscribers on YouTube and became the first Twitch streamer to reach 10 million followers earlier this year. Ninja spends about 12 hours a day playing live on Twitch from his basement studio and has brought home as much as $500,000 a month through subscription fees and donations. His meteoric rise to the top of the video game world with \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" has earned him a number of valuable opportunities, including commercials with Samsung, an ESPN the Magazine cover story, and an ongoing sponsorship from Red Bull.\n\nRed Bull recently partnered with Portland-based creative agency Roundhouse to help Ninja redesign his home streaming setup, his primary base of operations. Roundhouse Creative Director Robert Medkeff flew to meet Ninja in Chicago where they discussed how to upgrade the studio and maintain his personal flair. The agency has worked on major gaming-related projects with Red Bull and Twitch in the past, but designing a state-of-the-art studio brought forth a new set of challenges. Roundhouse presented Ninja with a number of potential plans for the studio; once the gamer chose his favorite, they began fleshing the design out with the best possible technology and lighting options.\n\nThe studio fills the entire basement room. Red Bull\n\n\"His new studio needed to inspire creativity and support multiple types of content, and stand out as the first gaming studio of its kind,\" Medkeff told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nWhile most of Ninja's streams consist of him playing at his desk, the new studio encompasses the full basement room. The space was given a custom acoustic treatment and has been fully outfitted with controllable, color changing LED lighting. Once wall includes eight different monitors for Ninja to host graphics or playback video from his dedicated video server.

The goal of the studio is to be a one-stop shop for any type of gaming broadcast and everything in the room can be controlled from a digital switch board on Ninja's desk. Despite the big time studio upgrades, Ninja will still be using the same custom built NZXT computer and the free Open Broadcaster Software to stream.\n\nRoundhouse also worked to ensure that Ninja's personality was preserved within the studio. Medkeff said the partnership between Ninja and Red Bull was balanced and stress-free. The room was designed with Ninja's personal branding in mind but the space isn't dominated by sponsor logos.\n\nDozens of his personal trinkets line the room, including trophies, Funko POP figures, a \"Fortnite\" pickaxe, and a signed Detroit Lions football helmet. Medkeff said the look of the trophy wall will evolve as Ninja adds more personal effects.

Trump plans to meet with his trade team on Tuesday to discuss the report. Releasing a Commerce Department report on auto tariffs would be the next formal step toward imposing such restrictions.\n\nTrump has previously threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all autos and auto parts coming into the US to extract concessions from trading partners including the European Union and Canada. The Commerce Department has launched a formal investigation into possible auto tariffs under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs on any good as long as there is a national security justification.\n\nThe process is the same used by the Trump administration to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum and the rules of the investigation require the Commerce Department to submit a report to the president by February\n\nRead more: These are the states that would be wrecked by Trump's proposed tariff on cars\u00bb\n\nAlmost no members of Trump's cabinet \u2014 except hyper-protectionist adviser Peter Navarro \u2014 are in favor of auto tariffs, according to the news website Axios, due to the major economic disruptions the restrictions could cause.

Their findings show that the colloquial 'pink tax' \u2014 or premiums women pay on every day items\u2014 isn't just limited to the checkout line, but also finds its way into getting around the city.\n\nAccording to the study, 75% of women said they had experienced some form of harassment on pubic transit, while less than half of male respondents answered similarly. That statistic fits nicely with the study's finding that a similarly high proportion of taxi and for-hire car trips were for female riders.\n\n\"For late night travel, most respondents feel safest using for-hire vehicles (42%),\" study authors Sarah Kaufmann, Christopher Polack and Gloria Campbell write. \"followed by taxis (16%), and then public transportation (15%).\"\n\nIt seems intuitive that a car would be safer than a sparsely ridden late-night train home, but even New York City Transit's efforts to curb harassment and attacks in the system seem to have little effect, according to selected responses published by the researchers.\n\n\"After waiting in line to speak with the person in the booth,\" one person who did report to authorities said, \"a train passed through the station, so I was told the person who harassed me had probably already left and it wasn't worth calling the police.

Ninety-four percent of respondents have a college degree or higher \u2014 more than three times the national average\u2014 the researchers said, which could affect their data and added to a disproportionate amount of subway riders on lines through those neighborhoods.\n\nThe researchers plan to conduct another survey, that \"will aim at a more diverse user base to provide a wider range of experiences.\"\n\nBased on the first round of results, the center has proposed \"well-lit for-hire vehicle pickup points,\" like Uber now provides in some locations, as well as subsidized work-railed rides like Lyft currently provides in Michigan and Medford, NJ.\n\n\"Conclusion: Women are more likely than men to change their behavior in order to avoid harassment,\" the study said.", "2018 Lord Mayor's Banquet in London Thomson Reuters By Andrew MacAskill and Elizabeth Piper\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday that there were still considerable unresolved issues with the European Union over Brexit as the two sides approached the \"endgame\" in negotiations for departure from the bloc.\n\nMay's compromise plan, which seeks to maintain close trade ties with the EU in the future, is facing opposition from Brexiteers, pro-Europeans, the Northern Irish party that props up her government, and even some of her own ministers.\n\n\"The negotiations for our departure are now in the endgame,\" May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London's financial district. \"We are working extremely hard, through the night, to make progress on the remaining issues in the Withdrawal Agreement, which are significant.\"\n\nWith under five months until Britain leaves the EU, talks have stalled over a disagreement on the so-called Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.\n\nMay's attempt to unblock the talks by considering an extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current proposed end date of December 2021 has both angered eurosceptics and EU supporters in her party.\n\nFears that the proposals would mean keeping Britain inside the EU's customs union indefinitely or that Northern Ireland would have to accept different rules and regulations to the rest of the United Kingdom have focused opposition to May's deal.\n\nNegotiations are continuing this week, but officials are warning unless there is dramatic progress by the end of Wednesday there is unlikely to be a summit this month to approve a Brexit deal.\n\nBrexit talks with the EU ran through Sunday night until 0245 and resumed on Monday morning.\n\nBoth sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world's biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest national economy.\n\nNOT AT ANY COST\n\nThe prime minister told the audience in her annual speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet that she would not agree a Brexit deal \"at any cost\".\n\n\"Both sides want to reach an agreement. But what we are negotiating is immensely difficult,\" May said. \"This will not be an agreement at any cost.\"\n\nShe also said that Britain was open to better relations with Russia after ties plunged to a post-Cold War low over an attack involving a military-grade nerve agent on English soil.\n\nThe poisonings of double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, blamed by Britain on Russian intelligence agents earlier this year, strained ties between the countries.\n\nShe said that Britain was \"ready to respond in kind\" if there were signs of increased cooperation from Russia.\n\nA year ago, May used a speech at the same venue to accuse Moscow of military aggression and of meddling in elections, some of her strongest criticism even before the poisoning of a former Russian spy.\n\nThis year, she said that the action taken since - including the largest ever coordinated expulsion of Russian intelligence officers - had \"fundamentally degraded\" Russia's intelligence capability.\n\nDespite the ongoing threats, the prime minister will say \"this is not the relationship with Russia that we want.\"\n\n(Reporting by Andrew MacAskill and Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Richard Balmforth)", "Luxury apartment buildings are going to increasingly greater lengths to attract tenants, offering outrageous amenities that include rooftop running tracks and dog parks, outdoor movie theaters, and residents-only bars and restaurants.\n\nThis move reflects a shift in what luxury buyers and renters are looking for.

The deals include 40% off pajamas this week, plus a chance to get a free pair slippers when you purchase a set of pajamas from November 9 through 22.\n\nThe retailer is also offering a free $20 reward card with every $40 purchase for the entire month.\n\nThese are certainly good deals, but they seem less enticing when you consider that many of Victoria's Secret's items are discounted throughout the year, including some of its core products.\n\nVictoria's Secret has increasingly leaned on promotions to drive traffic to its stores. However, as sales growth has stalled \u2014 same-store sales growth was down 5% at its stores in the second quarter of 2018 \u2014 these deals only erode profit margins further.\n\n\"Pricing power continues to erode as promotions continue to rise, yet the consumer isn't responding,\" Jefferies analyst Randal Konik wrote in a note to clients in August.\n\n\"This increased promotional posture is an attempt to conceal fading brand resonance, and could create a bumpy ride ahead as it pulls forward demand,\" he later wrote in November.\n\nVictoria's Secret isn't alone here. Heavy discounting has been the flavor of the past decade as retailers try to appeal to price-conscious consumers scarred by the recession. As a result, consumers have become hooked on discounts and usually aren't willing to pay full price.\n\nRead more: Gap is doubling down on one of retail's deadliest mistakes\n\nBut while some retailers say they are using discounts to clear excess inventory, analysts say it is especially concerning to see that Victoria's Secret's deals and discounts extend to its core items. Take panties, for example \u2014 they are usually offered at five for $28.50, but are frequently on sale for less than that. This week, you can buy 10 for $35. Earlier this year, Victoria's Secret was offering eight for $28, which works out to be the same price per item.\n\nThe Body By Victoria bras, another core product, are also currently on sale for $25 each, down from $54.50.\n\nKonik said that it is also concerning to see sister brand Pink, which was once Victoria's Secret's saving grace, jump on the discounting bandwagon. In recent months, this teen label has ramped up its discounts significantly.\n\n\"Pink was never promoted like this in the past and the risk ahead in our view is Pink becomes the next Juicy Couture (e.g. boom then bust),\" he wrote in August.", "Alibaba made e-commerce history on Sunday, recording $30.8 billion in sales in 24 hours at the its Singles Day celebration.\n\nBut the annual growth rate dropped from 39% to 27%, the smallest gain in the event's 10-year history.\n\nThis comes as China, the world's second-largest economy, cools down amid deleveraging and ongoing trade tensions with the US.\n\nWatch Alibaba trade live.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's Singles Day event on Sunday was the biggest online-shopping day in history, but it also signaled a weaker macro environment in China.\n\nAlibaba reported that customers spent $30.8 billion in 24 hours, a significant increase from the $25.3 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) Alibaba shoppers spent in 2017. That was almost three times the amount of last year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales combined.\n\nSingles Day (November 11) was originally created as a student holiday in China to celebrate single people. Alibaba turned it into an online-shopping festival in 2009, and now it's the world's largest online-shopping festival, outstripping traditional American shopping holidays.\n\nDespite its record-breaking sales, the GMV annual growth rate dropped from 39% to 27%, the smallest rate increase in the event's 10-year history.\n\n\"We believe this suggests a weaker macro environment in China, on top of the law of large numbers,\" Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein said.\n\nAnd this comes as the world's second-largest economy cools down amid deleveraging and ongoing trade tensions with the US. In the third quarter, China's economy grew at a 6.5% year-over-year rate, the weakest since the financial crisis. At the same time, quarterly nationwide consumer expenditures grew 6.3%, down from 7.5% in 2014.\n\nEconomists have attributed the slowdown to economic weakness that was caused in part by a deleveraging campaign started last year that has pushed up companies' borrowing costs. Additionally, the Trump administration has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and has tariffs on the remaining $250 billion of goods ready to go.\n\nAnd Alibaba has felt the pain from China\u2019s slowing economic growth. As part of the e-commerce giant's September quarter results, the company posted revenue of $85.1 billion, missing the $86.5 billion that was expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Bloomberg. Alibaba also slashed its fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance by 4% to 6%, citing an uncertain economy.", "One of the hardest parts of a job interview is talking about your flaws and stumbles.\n\nSometimes the prompt is literally, \"what's your greatest weakness?\" Other times it's, \"why were you let go from your last job?\"\n\nIf you're interviewing with Traci Wilk, there's a good chance she'll encourage you to \"tell me about the most challenging work experience that you had and what you learned from it.\"\n\nWilk is the senior vice president of people at The Learning Experience, an early education and childcare franchise. She has also led human resources departments at Starbucks, Coach, and rag & bone. She told Business Insider that, when she asks candidates to share their most challenging work experiences, she's not exactly trying to suss out their tendency to miss deadlines or talk back to their boss.\n\nInstead, she's looking for evidence of a \"growth mindset.\"\n\nRead more: All that advice to 'find your passion' isn't just clich\u00e9 \u2014 it could be actively bad\n\nWilk said that if the candidate naturally talks about \"things that they would have done differently,\" that's a good sign because it shows a \"high degree of self-awareness.\" She especially wants to see the candidate share some \"reflection or a postmortem that they may have done after the situation, how they've taken that and applied it into future situations.\"\n\nIn fact, Wilk added, she's generally more interested in a candidate's ability to learn than in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \"Is this someone that's going to come into the organization certainly with best practices, but also willing to be flexible, willing to be innovative?

(The opposite is a \"fixed mindset,\" which refers to the belief that your talents are innate and can't change much.) Dweck's research suggests that people with a growth mindset tend to be more successful.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told Bloomberg that Dweck's book, \"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success,\" inspired him to emphasize the importance of a growth mindset among his employees. Microsoft's chief people officer, Kathleen Hogan, told Geekwire that Microsoft employees weren't supposed to prove they're the smartest people in the room, but they were instead supposed to \"learn and bring out the best in people.\"\n\nAs for talking about challenging career experiences in a job interview, if you're worried about being too candid about your screwups, you probably shouldn't be.\n\n\"It really shows that this person is confident enough to be vulnerable. I'd much rather bring somebody into the organization that has taken risks and failed than [somebody who] has always taken the safe route,\" Wilk said.", "A little over six years ago, Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith stared at a $500 million acquisition offer \u2014 half a billion dollars! \u2014 for his bootstrapped company doing $50 million in revenue.\n\nAnd he turned it down.\n\nInstead, he decided to gamble that he could grow his company into something far bigger and far more valuable.\n\nQualtrics was on the verge of what was promising to be one of the biggest, most successful initial public offerings of 2018. His company was on track to be valued at about $5 billion or more when he rang the bell on Wednesday.\n\nRead more: The CEO of SAP spent months convincing this startup to ditch its IPO and take his $8 billion offer: Here's why SAP wanted Qualtrics so badly\n\nInstead, on Sunday night, a jubilant Smith hopped on the phone with Business Insider \u2014 along with the CEO of SAP, Bill McDermott \u2014 to talk about why he sold his company to SAP for $8 billion in a surprise deal.\n\n\"We're here because we want to be,\" Smith said. \"I think the IPO would be every bit as big as this.\"\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\n\nQualtrics was on the brink of an IPO\n\nSmith was still on the IPO roadshow when he signed the acquisition papers, he said. And he wants everyone to know: This was not a fire sale. Investors were crazy about the idea of buying a piece of Qualtrics.\n\n\"Our IPO is 13 times oversubscribed already, and we hadn't finished the second week,\" he told us.\n\nQualtrics was growing at over 50% a year, had generated $289.9 million in revenue in 2017, and was profitable. And not only was it profitable that year, but it had been cash-flow positive since it was founded.\n\nA fast-growing, profitable cloud startup doing almost $300 million in annual revenue? That's a real unicorn.\n\nShares were initially priced at $18 to $21, which at the midpoint would have valued the company at $4.8 billion, about twice its last private valuation as a startup. But investors were so hot that the company was most likely going to raise the price, Smith implied, while still expecting a big pop the first day. It might have ended up being worth something within striking distance of what SAP will pay.\n\nMcDermott goes on a charm offensive\n\nAll of that means Smith felt no need to sell to SAP or any of the other suitors he's had over the years. McDermott had for months been doggedly working on Smith to sell, they said.\n\n\"It wasn't one conversation. You know I don't go down that easy,\" Smith said jokingly. He had fended off would-be buyers before and hinted that others who kicked the tires included big cloud companies in Silicon Valley and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nBut anyone who has ever met McDermott, the first American CEO of the German company, knows he can be persuasive, even if it takes some time.\n\n\"Trust comes in drops,\" McDermott said.\n\nMcDermott had been impressed with Smith and Qualtrics after an initial lunch they had some months ago. Qualtrics could give SAP the growth it needs in its cloud business as well as a product edge in the cutthroat worlds of marketing and sales software, where SAP competes against the likes of Salesforce, Microsoft, and Oracle.\n\nMcDermott said he knew he wanted to buy Qualtrics even as the impending IPO meant that the price was only going to go up.\n\nSAP CEO Bill McDermott. SAP Persuading Smith was like a courtship. They had a \"special dinner\" at a mountain resort with Smith's cofounder and brother, Jared Smith.\n\nThey rode bikes and went to dinner together with their wives. They met at another Northern California conference where they were both speaking, at which point McDermott scored an invite to Qualtrics' headquarters in Provo, Utah.\n\nDuring that visit, they played some hoops, with McDermott still wearing his dress shoes. (He still feels guilty about the scuff marks he left on the court, he said.)\n\n\"And it builds to this crescendo today,\" McDermott said. \"It's two guys totally committed to the mission and to winning.\"\n\nSmith said he expected the company to be valued near the $8 billion he sold to SAP for on Day One as a public company.\n\n\"Ryan drives a hard bargain,\" McDermott said. \"He doesn't care about a numerator, but about the security of his people.\"\n\nThe Smiths become billionaires\n\nRyan Smith founded the company in 2002 in his father's basement, after his father was diagnosed with cancer, as a way of spending more time with him. Ryan then persuaded Jared, a Google exec, to quit his job and help him build Qualtrics with their father as a cofounder.\n\nTogether, the family has maintained tight control over the company, and they didn't take any venture-capital funding until 2012, when they had been in business for a decade. Ultimately, Qualtrics raised $400 million in venture funding.\n\nBut it's impossible to know exactly what the Smith family's take is from this $8 billion sale, even though Qualtrics has published its financial results and named its top shareholders as part of the process of going public.\n\nRyan and Jared Smith are brothers who founded Qualtrics. Qualtrics That's because Qualtrics was creating three classes of shares for its IPO. One was for the Smith family \u2014 Ryan, Jared, and their father \u2014 with super-voting rights. The second was for existing investors, also with super-voting rights, and the third was traditional shares for regular investors.\n\nThis structure meant that had Qualtrics gone through with its IPO, the Smiths would have retained 51% voting power in the company while simultaneously obfuscating how big a stake they actually owned.\n\nWe also don't know the exact terms that SAP was offering for each class of shares \u2014 just that it adds up to $8 billion.\n\nBut pushing all those caveats aside for now, and just for fun, we did some back-of-the-napkin math based on some presumptions.\n\nAmong the three classes of shares, there were just under 196 million outstanding in the hands of investors, the company reported in its IPO documents.\n\nIf each share were priced equally in this sale \u2014 meaning the Smiths weren't claiming a higher price for their preferred stock \u2014 then an $8 billion deal would value each share at just under $41. Though that's a big if.\n\nThe Smith family, through a holding company, owns 88,823,418 shares. At $41 a share, those shares would net the Smiths well over $3.6 billion in cash.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Ryan Smith certainly did better than selling his company for $500 million in 2012.\n\nThe final word\n\nUltimately, what persuaded Smith to sell, he said, was this: Not only could he jump straight to an $8 billion payout for himself, his employees, and his investors, but Qualtrics would instantly become a global company with access to SAP's 413,000 global customers and 15,000-strong salesforce.\n\nSmith's vision is to create a new market he calls \"experience management,\" where a company takes all the data it has on customers, employees, partners, and prospects and gives itself a complete view of how well it's serving everyone. Qualtrics offers cloud software designed to help a company understand how a group of unhappy employees in one department might be creating a group of unhappy customers in another area.\n\nSAP, as the world's largest maker of financial software, also offers everything from marketing software to human-resources wares \u2014 and is sitting on all the data Qualtrics needs to make this new market a reality.\n\n\"I want to go partner with Bill and SAP and go do this,\" Smith said.", "Sears' creditors are demanding that the company shut down all its remaining stores.\n\nThe retailer's plan to survive bankruptcy is \"nothing more than wishful thinking\" and \"an unjustified and foolhardy gamble with other people's money,\" a group of unsecured creditors has declared in a new filing.\n\nSears has proposed cutting its store count to roughly 400 profitable stores, then selling the associated real estate to raise cash while the company works to return to profitability.

Producer Bernd Eichinger owned the film rights to the comic, but a clause in his contract stated that he would lose the rights if he didn't go into production on a \"Fantastic Four\" movie by December 31, 1992. Up to that point, Eichinger had failed to convince a Hollywood studio to commit to a big-budget version of the story. The producer crafted a clever way to hold onto the rights so that he could later make a big-budget version of \"The Fantastic Four.\" He called on Roger Corman, a legendary producer famous for his ability to crank out movies with low budgets and short schedules. It turns out that Eichinger never had any intention of releasing this low-budget version of the comic \u2014 a fact that he withheld for the movie's cast and crew.

A new duvet cover, of course.\n\nIn much the same way that a new jacket can add a new spring in your step in even the coldest of winters, a duvet cover (which really, is just a jacket for your comforter) can do wonders for even the bleakest of rooms. And when it comes to finding the perfect duvet cover, you'll want to strongly consider one from Cultiver. I didn't know what was missing in my bedroom until I found the company's Linen Duvet Cover Set, and now that I've found it, I'm constantly wondering how I can replace everything else in my life with linen.\n\nI've made my way through plenty of duvet covers in my ongoing quest to elevate the aesthetic of my bedroom.\n\nUnfortunately, I've often had to choose between form and function in selecting my not-quite-ideal cover. There are the options that boast attractive patterns or elegant colors, but are less than comfortable as a result of their polyester construction. Then, there are those that are luxurious to the touch, but result in my duvet bunching oddly at various corners, which gives way to a particularly lumpy looking bed (a look that I've never fully understood). But with the Cultiver set, none of these issues came to pass.\n\nFirst off, Cultiver's duvet covers fit, and they fit well. Simply insert your existing comforter into Cultiver's waiting arms, button the simple, yet elegant Mother of Pearl button closures, and from there, you'll have a sleek, sophisticated bedspread. While linen can look a bit rumpled and disheveled if handled incorrectly, I haven't found this to be the case with my Cultiver set. Instead, the material drapes attractively, covering the entirety of your bed and hanging an appropriate length along the sides (without looking wrinkled).\n\nBut beyond fit, what really sets linen duvet covers apart must be their superior comfort.\n\nThough I've never been one to sleep directly on top of or beneath my duvet (can you really say that you're an adult if there's not a flat sheet on your bed?), having the Cultiver cover has really begun to tempt me. Not only is the linen wonderfully soft, but it's also particularly breathable. Rather than sweating my way through the night, practically suffocated by a too-heavy comforter and a stuffy cover, this linen option allows for airflow. It's cozy, but it won't cramp your cool sleeping style either.\n\nAll of Cultiver's linen duvet covers are made from 100% linen woven from European flax, and are pre-washed for that aforementioned softness. What's more, these linen covers are also surprisingly durable. Despite having gone through the wash a couple times already, my cover hasn't suffered from any fraying or loose threads.\n\nIn addition to the duvet cover itself, Cultiver's duvet set comes with two matching pillowcases, which are every bit as comfortable as the cover itself. And while these pillow cases could certainly be used for your decorative throw pillows, I've enjoyed rubbing my face against the linen throughout the night. If you'd rather get pillowcases that accent your chosen duvet cover color, you can do so as well by building your own set \u2014 in this case, you can mix and match patterns and colors and define your bedroom look from start to finish.\n\nAs lovely as this linen set is, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the rather hefty price tag. The Linen Duvet Cover Sets will set you back at least $220 (the price for a twin). It's money well spent, but all the same, it's quite a bit of money for naught more than a cover.\n\nCultiver offers these covers in 17 colors and patterns. The Ice, an extremely light blue, is a personal favorite of mine, but it's hard to imagine going wrong with any of the company's options.", "When Martin Sorrell quit under fire last spring as the CEO of the world's most powerful marketing juggernaut, WPP, he didn't miss a beat. \"Back to the future\" is where he told reporters he was headed.\n\nSix weeks later he was launching a new warship, S4 Capital, and immediately beat his former employers in a $350 million battle for global ad-production powerhouse MediaMonks.

Also, anyone doing high-level digital disruption.\n\n(Editor's note: After our interview, the news broke that Sir Martin was engaged in talks on his next acquisition, the programmatic specialist MightyHive. Representatives from S4 declined to comment.)\n\nYou mention content, but S4's prospectus specifically eschews involvement in \"brand identity\" \u2014 isn't that the bread and butter of many agencies?\n\nBig ideas are still pivotal, but people in our industry continue to define \"creative\" very narrowly.

A lot of the ad industry seems almost panicked.\n\nThey're not taking note of the fundamental changes \u2014 not just technological, geographic as well. The new model has to develop. It has to be faster, it has to be better, it has to be more efficient.\n\nFaster, better, and more efficient than what?\n\nClients are looking for co-located resources. They're looking for in-house models.

You're an elephant. S4 is happy to be just a peanut \u2014 or maybe a coconut.\n\nSo you're not worried that, say, Amazon will eat absolutely everybody's lunch?\n\nAmazon is an opportunity. Among other things, it will provide some balance against the others.\n\nPrivacy regulation \u2014 bug or feature?\n\nIt's inevitable.

Instagram is not reality.\n\nIn China, which I visited in April, the \"Rainbow Mountains\" were a perfect example. The Zhangye Geological Park is home to a Danxia landform, a unique geological formation of layered colored sand stones and conglomerates.\n\nPrior to visiting, I had seen tons of photos of the Danxia landform on Instagram, Google, Reddit, and various travel magazines. I had also seen pictures of a similar formation located in the Andes Mountains in Peru.\n\nMost of the pictures I saw looked like the photo of the Danxia landform at the top of this article \u2014 bright reds and vibrant yellows in perfect distinct layers.\n\nWhen I visited the landform, I encountered a much different sight. While the formations are no doubt spectacular in person, the effect that the \"Rainbow Mountains\" give off is far more subtle.\n\nHere's a photo from my visit, with minimal editing:\n\nA photo of the \"Rainbow Mountains\" taken by the author, with minimal edits.

Times Asi/Flickr\n\nChina recently made history as the first country besides the US to field stealth aircraft with its J-20 fighter, but reports from its regional rival, India, indicate that it may want to go back to the drawing board.\n\nThe Indian Defence Research Wing says its Russian-made Su-30MKI fighter jets can spot the supposedly-stealth J-20s, and has already observed them in flight.\n\nIndian Air Force Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa said the \"Su-30 radar is good enough and can pick it (J-20) up from many kilometers away,\" according to Indian news website Zee News.\n\nIndia has been basing its Su-30MKIs in the northern part of the country to counter China's deployments of J-20s, which struggle to take off in the high altitudes near Tibet, Zee News reported.\n\nThe Su-30MKI represents a new and effective Russian jet with an advanced array of radars that Justin Bronk, an air combat expert at the Royal United Services Institute told Business Insider could probably spot the J-20.\n\n\"It is entirely possible that the Su-30MKI can pick up track information on J-20 from quite long ranges,\" Bronk said. \"But what I would expect is that those tracks may be fairly intermittent and dependent on what headings the J-20 is flying on relative to the Sukhoi trying to detect it.\"\n\nSU-30MKI Vitaly Kuzmin\n\nBronk explained that unlike the US's F-22 and F-35 stealth jets, the J-20 doesn't have all-aspect stealth. This means that from some angles, the J-20 isn't stealthy. A senior stealth scientist previously told Business Insider the J-20 is stealthiest from the front end.\n\nIf China was flying the J-20s in any direction besides towards India, the Su-30MKI radars could have been spotting the jets from their more vulnerable sides.\n\n\"Also, it is possible that the Chinese are flying the J-20 with radar reflectors attached to enlarge and conceal its true radar cross section during peacetime operations \u2014 just as the USAF routinely does with the F-22 and F-35,\" said Bronk.\n\nFor safety and training purposes, stealth aircraft often fly with markers that destroy their stealth during peacetime maneuvers.\n\nIf this is the case with the J-20s, then India may be in for an unpleasant surprise next time it tries to track the supposedly stealth jets.", "Founders can be inspiring visionaries, making you believe that their idea, company, or product will change the world.\n\nThe power of an inspiring leader can be exciting, and the chance to work on the next huge success is appealing.\n\nBut whether the company is large or small, working directly for a founder can have some pitfalls you should consider before taking that job.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to four experts in the field for the following list of tips on what you should consider before working for a startup founder.", "On Tuesday, residents in three red states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah \u2014 voted to expand their state Medicaid program to more people with lower-incomes. This adds the states to the roster of 34 other states and Washington, DC, that have taken similar actions under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAt least three other states may also expand Medicaid: Kansas, Wisconsin, and Maine. That's because these states now have Democratic governors.\n\nThat'll be good news for health insurance companies that specialize in Medicaid, according to a Barclays report on Monday from analysts led by Steve Valiquette. Already, the share prices of Centene, Molina Healthcare, and WellCare Health Plans received an average bump of 9% the day after the election.\n\nThe actual profits that the health insurance companies stand to earn in those six states are relatively limited. Those states could add about 725,000 people to Medicaid, or $3.2 billion in incremental spending, the Barclays analysts said, citing a study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nExpansion in those six states would boost Centene's profit by about 0.5% next year, while adding 1.4% to Molina's earnings and 0.4% at WellCare, according to Barclays.\n\nThe bigger opportunity would come if remaining holdout states adopt Medicaid expansion. In total, coverage would expand to over 7 million people, representing nearly $35 billion in incremental spending.\n\nAmong these states, the biggest profit opportunities for health insurers would be in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, which together account for 50% of the total.\n\nBased on current state market shares and company presence, Barclays estimated that the companies that would benefit most if all the remaining states expanded Medicaid are Centene (10% profit increase), Molina (10%), and WellCare Health Plans (14%).\n\nAnalysts think that Anthem would benefit slightly and that expansion would have very little impact on Cigna, Humana, or UnitedHealth Group.", "Six days after Election Day, several key races are still up in the air as Republicans promote unfounded allegations of fraud committed by Democratic voters and elections officials, while Democrats demand that all the votes be counted.\n\nThe flaws in Florida's vote-counting system are being exposed through recounts following razor-thin margins in the state's Senate and gubernatorial races, among others.\n\nFlorida\n\nSince election night, Florida has counted tens of thousands of additional mail-in, overseas, and provisional ballots, concentrated in heavily populated Democratic-leaning counties, which has significantly diminished GOP leads in the Senate race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, as well as in the gubernatorial contest between Democrat Andrew Gillum and GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIn Florida, a machine recount is required if the margin between the candidates is 0.5 of a percentage point or less. The contests for governor, Senate, and state agriculture commissioner all reached this threshold as votes continued to be counted days after Tuesday's election. The two latter races may require an additional manual recount, which is triggered when margins are below a 0.25 percentage-point threshold. (Three other non-statewide races will also be determined through recounts).\n\nAs of Monday morning, Scott is leading Nelson by 0.2 of a percentage point \u2014 or 12,562 votes out of the almost 8.2 million cast \u2014 which puts Scott at 50.1% of the total vote. In the governor's race, DeSantis is leading Gillum by 0.4 of a percentage point \u2014 about 33,684 votes.\n\nRead More: Florida is in chaos as thousands of ballots remain uncounted, and the outcome of the state's key elections could remain unclear for weeks\n\nOfficial recounts began in about half of Florida's 67 counties on Sunday.\n\nIn a manual recount, elections officials would be able to look into both \"overvoting,\" when two votes were counted by the machine in the same contest on a single ballot, and \"undervoting,\" when no votes were registered by the machine in a given race.\n\nFlorida is also one of a handful of states with a so-called \"signature-matching law,\" which requires that the signature on the envelope of an absentee ballot match the signature on file with the state. Thousands of absentee ballots have so far been rejected because of signature issues.\n\nNelson filed a lawsuit which contends rejecting ballots because of mismatched signatures is wholly unconstitutional.\n\nAll kinds of vote-counting issues have been reported in Florida in recent days, including faulty tallying machines, votes that were delayed past the deadline by the postal service, and rejected votes inadvertently counted as legitimate.\n\nThe deadline for final machine recount results is Thursday, but the election overseer for Palm Beach County has already said it will be \"impossible\" to conduct a full recount in that key county by the deadline.\n\nRepublicans, including Scott, DeSantis, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Matt Gaetz, are all arguing that thousands of illegal votes were cast in the Sunshine State, and that elections officials in left-leaning counties \u2014 South Florida's Broward County, in particular \u2014 are committing electoral fraud.\n\nThe claims have provoked protests by Republicans outside of the election supervisors' facilities.\n\nAs part of this GOP effort, Scott sued over the weekend to require law enforcement to seize ballots and vote-counting machines in Broward and Palm Beach counties during the times when votes aren't being counted. On Monday, a judge denied Scott's injunction, pointing out that he didn't have any evidence of \"fraud or irregularities\" to support having law enforcement monitor the ballots and machines.\n\nNo evidence has emerged that any fraud or criminal activity has occurred anywhere in the state over the counting of votes, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said on Friday that it is not investigating anything related to midterm elections. Florida's secretary of state, appointed by Scott, has insisted that there are no credible allegations of election fraud to investigate.\n\nTrump weighed in yet again on Monday morning on Twitter, alleging widespread voter fraud and insisting Scott and DeSantis should be declared victorious.\n\n\"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\" he wrote. \"An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\"\n\nDemocrats have pushed back on the conspiracies and unsubstantiated claims of fraud promoted by the GOP. The Florida Democratic Party compared Scott's efforts to cast doubt on the election to the fascist actions of Venezuelan and Cuban dictators.\n\n\"Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\" Juan Pe\u00f1alosa, the state party director, said in a statement over the weekend. \"The Governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our Democracy.\"\n\nStacey Abrams won Georgia's Democratic gubernatorial primary in May. Jessica McGowan/Getty Images\n\nGeorgia\n\nIn Georgia's gubernatorial race, Democrat Stacey Abrams is trailing Republican Brian Kemp, who has 50.3% of the vote, by about 58,000 votes \u2014 or 1.5 percentage points.\n\nBallots continue to be counted in the red state, and a runoff would be triggered if neither candidate earns 50% of the vote in the final count. While Kemp has called Abrams' refusal to concede \"a disgrace to democracy,\" thousands of provisional ballots have been counted since election day \u2014 including at polling sites that initially said they had completed their counts.\n\nDespite the ongoing count \u2014 which will end on Tuesday, both Kemp and Trump have declared Republican victory in the race.\n\nDemocrats, led by Abrams, are engaged in a last-ditch effort to get all the state's provisional voters to ensure that their ballots were counted. But Abrams would need over 20,000 more votes to trigger a runoff, which would be held on December 4, and it's unclear whether there are enough uncounted votes to get Abrams there.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for each and every eligible vote to be counted because in a democracy, every vote should be valued. Georgians deserve nothing less,\" Abrams' campaign manager told NBC News on Saturday.\n\nFurther intensifying the contentious battle are charges that the state has engaged in widespread voter suppression. As Georgia's secretary of state, Kemp purged an unprecedented 1.5 million inactive voters from the rolls and classified over 50,000 voters \u2014 the vast majority of whom are black \u2014 as \"pending\" because their information did not precisely reflect data in government records.\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema. Bob Christie/AP\n\nArizona\n\nOn election night, it looked like Republican Rep. Martha McSally would eke out a victory over Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona's tight US Senate race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake.\n\nBut as the state continued tallying tens of thousands of mail-in and provisional ballots (75% of the state votes by mail), the Democrat has taken the lead.\n\nAs of Monday, Sinema led McSally by more than 32,000 votes, or 1.2 percentage points. Democrats say they're confident Sinema will prevail, in part because the remaining uncounted ballots largely come from Democratic-leaning areas.\n\nTrump has charged that the tight race is being swung by \"electoral corruption\" \u2014 tweeting on Friday that \"SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH\" and arguing the state may need to hold a runoff. But some Arizona Republicans, including McSally, have resisted pressure to promote these unfounded allegations.", "California is still burning.\n\nAs of Tuesday, three major wildfires \u2014 the Camp, Hill, and Woolsey fires\u2014 have killed dozens of people and scorched hundreds of thousands of acres of forests and infrastructure.\n\nFirefighters are struggling to contain the biggest blazes.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which is located north of Sacramento, quickly burned the entire town of Paradise to the ground.

One of the hassles is coordinating the handoff of the keys. There are a number of solutions to this problem, but until recently, we didn't try any of them. Then, we got smart: a smart lock to be precise.\n\nAs we were renovating our home, we knew we wanted the guest room entrance to have a keyless entry. Schlage \u2014 founded in 1920 and one of the top names in the industry \u2014 was generous enough to send us their Schlage Connect to test out for free. Below is our experience with it.\n\nMy first experiences with the Schlage Connect Deadbolt\n\nI don't have any experience installing deadbolts so I was pretty intimidated by the task. It was only out of necessity \u2014 we had guests coming to stay in a few days \u2014 that I finally mustered up the courage to take on this task.\n\nThanks to the outdated design of our turn-of-the-century home, I first had to adjust the depth and size of the mortise \u2014 the hole where the deadbolt goes into the frame. I didn't know the first thing about mortising. I didn't even know what mortising was. Fortunately, I had a friend who showed me how to do it. With a chisel and a hammer, she helped me chip away at the hole. I also learned how to create an indent and drill holes for installing the door plate through which the bolt would slide.\n\nIt was a fun learning process, but it added a fair amount of time to the installation process. Another hiccup I had was failing to uncoil the internal power cord correctly when putting the assembly together. I had to disassemble the setup and redo a couple steps to make the cord reach. When all was said and done, it took me a little over an hour to install the deadbolt. Still, I was impressed with how easy the lock was to install. And, if you have a newer home, you won't likely have to do any of the mortising I had to do, which will drastically cut down on the installation time.\n\nHow the Schlage Connect Deadbolt performed\n\nThe lock comes with a unique programming code and user codes. I recommend changing these immediately just to be safe and to get comfortable with the lock. I set the user code to be the last four digits of our guests' phone number to make it easy for everyone to remember. And, after they left, it was simple to just delete the code.\n\nYou can store up to 30 user codes between 4 and 8 digits in length. It's useful to give different people different codes so you can track the comings and goings of these individuals. You may not want to try this with family members, but it's useful for certain situations. For instance, if someone is supposed to feed your dog while you're on vacation, you can give them a code and track whether they followed through.\n\nOne of my favorite features was the auto-lock. With this, the deadbolt will automatically lock after 30 seconds. This is helpful because our kids and their friends hang out in the guest room when it's not in use, and they tend to forget to lock doors. The Connect doesn't come with auto-lock automatically enabled, but it's easy enough to set.\n\nAnother great feature is the alarm. You can set an alarm to sound whenever the door opens or closes, the lock is tampered with, or when significant force is applied to the door. I only set the 90-decibel alarm to go off when someone was trying to force their way in. In testing, it didn't take too much force for me to set the alarm off. Fortunately, you can also adjust the sensitivity of the lock.\n\nWe didn't have any performance issues with the Schlage Connect, and due to the ANSI Grade 1 rating of the lock, it should last for many years to come. Grade 1 is the highest rating a lock can have. In order to get this rating, the lock must be able to handle a million open/close cycles and withstand 10 strikes of 75 pounds.\n\nRead more: The best smart locks you can buy to make your front door high-tech\n\nSome concerns about the deadbolt\n\nUnfortunately, I was not able to test out the Schlage Connect's Z-wave connectivity. My smart home hub, which also serves as my router, only supports devices with the Zigbee protocol. Fortunately, just this month, Schlage launched a Zigbee-certified version of the Connect that also works with the Amazon Key app. It costs $199 right now. Or, you can pair it with the Amazon Cloud cam for $269. Aside from working with Zigbee protocol hubs and the app, the lock appears to have a lot of the same functionality as the generation I tested.\n\nWith a Z-Wave smart home hub, you can lock and unlock the door remotely. You can also program user codes using your smartphone rather than directly on the lock. If this sort of functionality is important to you, make sure you have a Z-Wave hub.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you have regular houseguests, then a smart lock is a must.\n\nIf for some reason our Schlage Connect were to disappear today, I would buy a new one \u2014 probably the new Zigbee version to work with my smart home hub. It's such a useful security tool thanks to the three alarm modes, auto-locking, and easy to program codes. Plus, you don't need the help of a professional to install it. Just make sure you have a handywoman nearby if you need to do any mortising.", "\"Venom\" continued its shocking box-office dominance over the weekend in China, where it opened to a huge $102 million. That's the third-biggest opening ever for a superhero movie there after \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" which opened to $191 million, and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, it was IMAX's biggest opening in the region, as well, with $10 million of the movie's China box office coming from IMAX screens.\n\nThis puts \"Venom's\" total worldwide gross at $673 million, which means it could top $700 million globally now that Chinese audiences are responding well to the movie. The movie's production budget was $100 million, and its earnings are even more impressive considering the film's lackluster 29% Rotten Tomatoes critic score.\n\n\"It seems that the disconnect between critics and audiences has taken on an international flair with audiences around the world and most recently China giving 'Venom' a resounding thumbs up in the face of mixed reviews at best for the film,\" Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian told Business Insider.\n\nIt's good news for Sony after its \"Girl in the Spider's Web\" bombed at the US box office this weekend. \"Venom\" has exceeded all expectations and has rejuvenated Sony's \"Spider-Man\" plans after they looked dead just a few years ago. Now, a \"Venom\" sequel is more than likely, and Sony can go all in on its other planned spin-offs.\n\nRead more:'Venom' gives Sony an edge over Disney in its fight to keep Spider-Man, according to industry experts\n\nExhibitor Relations senior box-office analyst Jeff Bock told Business Insider that the success of \"Venom\" in China comes down to the country's interest in monster movies.\n\n\"Monster movies are bonafide box office gold in China, and 'Venom' is about as monstrous as it gets in the superhero universe,\" Bock said.\n\nThis year's hit giant-shark movie, \"The Meg,\" grossed $527 million worldwide, helped largely by the $153 million it made in China. John Krasinski's \"A Quiet Place,\" about a family hiding from alien creatures that hunt by sound, received a rare extension on its release in China this year and scored $34 million there. And Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's giant-monster movie, \"Rampage,\" made $156 million in China after a sluggish start in the US.\n\nBock also attributes an \"advantageous\" release date to \"Venom's\" success in China. According to THR, a Japanese animated film, \"Detective Conan: Zero the Enforcer,\" opened second with just $10.6 million, and in third, a Chinese romance, \"Last Letter,\" opened with $5.4 million.\n\nDergarabedian views international audiences as responding to the same things that moviegoers in the US are \"as it continues to confound analysts.\"\n\n\"The film's unique style, Marvel branding, and, above all, Tom Hardy as the anti-hero at the heart of the story [are] proving to be an irresistible combination,\" he said.", "The Princeton Review has released its 2019 best law schools list.\n\nThe release includes a ranking of the best law schools for career prospects based on student surveys and school-reported data.\n\nStudents responded to survey questions on a law program's practical experience, externship opportunities, internships and clerkships, and how well prepared students feel after graduation to practice law.

Summit Learning was first designed with the help of engineers from Facebook, and gets funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a nonprofit started by the Facebook CEO and his wife Priscilla Chan.\n\n\"You have to teach yourself,\" a freshman at the Secondary School for Journalism told the New York Post. \"Students can easily cheat on quizzes since they can just copy and paste the question into Google.\"\n\nStudents in Brooklyn protested not only the implementation of Summit Learning in their school, but also the \"other wrongdoings\" going on within school leadership, according to a blog post from a New York educational activist.\n\nStudents at the Brooklyn high school haven't been the only ones to express dissatisfaction with Summit Learning, which has been adopted at 380 schools nationwide. Schools in the town of Cheshire, Connecticut \u2014 where Zuckerberg himself grew up \u2014 implemented Summit Learning last school year, but New York Magazine reported the switch was met with backlash from both kids and parents. The program was eventually shuttered at the school.\n\nA website called \"We the Parents,\" made up of parents from schools in eight states who are pushing back against Summit Learning has complained that the curriculum is a \"poor education product\" that has been improperly implemented, alienated students, and reduced teachers to the role of \"facilitators.\"\n\nParents have also raised privacy concerns over Summit Learning's collection of student data, especially as the platform has connections to a social media giant that itself has been plagued with concerns over its handling of personal information. However, Summit Learning has stressed that its relationship with Facebook is incredibly limited aside from its funding relationship with the Zuckerbergs.\n\nOne teacher who spoke to the New York Post, who asked to remain anonymous, complained that the Summit coursework had been prone to glitches, and that staff had run into issues supporting the online platform with its current WiFi setup.\n\nRead more: Facebook is nowhere near getting its house in order, says the data cop who fined it for the Cambridge Analytica catastrophe\n\nFollowing the student protests, Summit Learning has recommended that leadership at the Secondary School of Journalism cease using the curriculum program for its 11th and 12th grades.

Officials have declared it the most destructive wildfire in California history based on the loss of 6,700 structures.\n\nIn southern California, the Woolsey and Hill fires have burned more than 140 square miles in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. According to CalFire, the Woolsey Fire had burned about 91,500 acres as of Monday morning and was 20% contained.

The microchip implant essentially serves as an internal-employee-identification badge \u2014 the chips can be used to grant access to buildings and to pay for things around the office like food or print jobs. They can also be used to restrict access to certain off-limits areas.\n\nWhether having electronic circuits implanted between your thumb and forefinger is your idea of a job perk or a dystopian nightmare depends on your perspective, but the Telegraph notes that the chip implants would be optional for employees.\n\nBiohax didn't name any of the companies that were considering the implants, but one is a financial service with hundreds of thousands of employees, Biohax told The Telegraph.\n\nThe implants are similar to the microchips commonly used with pets and are inserted into the hand between the thumb and forefinger. Biohax says the implant process only takes a few seconds. After they're implanted, the microchips work similarly to contactless payment systems \u2014 the employee will just need to present their hand to a scanner to activate it.\n\nRead more: Thousands of people in Sweden are embedding microchips under their skin to replace ID cards\n\nSome have voiced their concerns over the practice, including UK labor unions like The Trade Unions Congress.\n\n\"We know workers are already concerned that some employers are using tech to control and micromanage, whittling away their staff's right to privacy,\" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said to alphr.com.\n\nJowan \u00d6sterlund, the founder of Biohax, anticipated this kind of response, but said employees shouldn't be worried.\n\n\"If this came from a government, I'd be like yeah, you know what, no that's not going happen,\" \u00d6sterlund said to The Telegraph. \"We're a private actor, we're doing this with our community, for our community.\"", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

The sign-up bonuses are sky-high and a growing list of attractive benefits makes it difficult to choose which credit card to add to your wallet.\n\nTo help make your choice easier is the Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card. As one of the best mid-tier cards, you can expect cash back for redemptions, a flexible rewards program, a low $95 annual fee, and above-grade benefits.\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nThe Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card offers 50,000 bonus points when you spend $3,000 in the first three months of opening the card. Essentially, the value of the 50,000 points is $500.\n\nBecause the Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card acts more like a cash-back card rather than earning points or miles that can be transferred and redeemed with travel partners, points are flexible and can be used for anything, including flights, gym memberships, a new laptop, or anywhere that accepts Visa. You will receive a statement credit that will post automatically, and the earning potential is virtually limitless.\n\nBonus categories\n\nIf you enjoy travel and dining, the card offers bonus categories for these two, earning you 2 points per dollar spent. Other great travel perks include the $100 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck, $100 airline credit, and trip delay insurance.\n\nFor all other categories, you will earn 1.5 points per dollar spent.\n\nAs a Bank of America customer, you even have the potential to increase your earnings by taking advantage of the Preferred Rewards Program. Basically, depending on how much you have invested with Bank of America, you can qualify for a higher earning rate.\n\nNo matter what you choose to redeem your points for, each point is worth one cent. This relieves stress for credit card holders who are used to spending copious amounts of time discerning the maximum value of every point. The Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card is simple and convenient, especially for users who like the idea of points functioning like cash. For example, you can redeem points as a statement credit against large purchases that aren't covered by points, such as a car, new television, airline flight, or lavish meal out.\n\nThe Bank of America Premium Rewards card offers some terrific travel benefits, such as trip protection and a credit toward Global Entry. Shutterstock/Rawpixel.com\n\nAnnual fee\n\nThis card has a low $95 annual fee and no foreign transaction fees.\n\nBenefitting from the Bank of America Premium Rewards Card\n\nYou can take advantage of some terrific benefits with your Bank of America Premium Rewards card. From Global Entry to trip protection, you can become a pro traveler just by adding this card! Here are the best benefits to know about:\n\n$100 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck\n\nIf you don't already have either of these, Global Entry is definitely the better option, as it includes TSA PreCheck. Your $100 credit will benefit you for the duration of up to five years, and you will save some serious time bypassing long lines when flying to international destinations. If you already have Global Entry, you can still apply this credit toward the application of a family member or friend.\n\n$100 airline incidental credit\n\nThis credit can be used toward purchases like seat upgrades, baggage fees, or in-flight services. It will automatically apply to your account each year, so make sure you get your money's worth when taking to the skies.\n\nBaggage delay insurance\n\nIf you have to wait more than six hours for your luggage, you will be reimbursed up to $100 a day for five days. Note that you will have to keep the receipts of any purchases on essentials like toiletries and clothing and submit a claim to be reimbursed.\n\nTrip delay insurance\n\nIf your flight is delayed more than 12 hours, you're eligible for reimbursement of up to $500 in expenses per ticket. This includes lodging and meals for those times when travel plans that go awry. You can also rest easy knowing you will be reimbursed up to $5,000 for any unused travel expenses like tours and hotels.\n\nPurchase protection\n\nIf you buy a new valuable that becomes damaged or lost, you can take advantage of purchase protection. You will be covered for repairs, replacements, or reimbursements up to $10,000 per claim.\n\nHow to redeem points\n\nThe most popular way to redeem points with this card is through cash back. Cash-back redemptions can be received in the form of a statement card, as a deposit it into an eligible Bank of America checking or savings account, or into a Merrill Lynch or 529 college savings account.\n\nIf you have vacation plans, you can book flights directly through the Bank of America travel portal. This works similarly to other redemption portals, where you can search flights as you would on a carrier website and complete your booking by redeeming points. You will still earn award miles and elite credits; however, you should always check the carrier website in the case of finding a better fare class at the same value. You could always purchase airfare and opt to receive cash back if you find a lower price elsewhere.\n\nAnother option allows you to redeem points for gift cards at Amazon, Whole Foods, Starbucks, and more. Out of your three redemption options, this is the least appealing for the fact that purchasing the items outright and redeeming your points as a statement credit would earn you more value, especially if you have to make a return.\n\nIs the Bank of America Premium Rewards card right for you?\n\nWith more and more airlines and hotels cutting the value of miles and points, it's all the more difficult to find available flights and hotel stays that maximize rewards. A card like the Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card stands out amongst restrictive competitors \u2014 its flexible, you don't need to scour awards charts, and your earning (statement credits) post automatically. It's a great option for anyone looking for a simple but solid rewards credit card.", "There are lots of details to consider when buying an engagement ring\u2014 but Nicole Wegman of Ring Concierge said that, all too often, people focus on the wrong ones.\n\nSince 2013, Wegman has been creating bespoke engagement rings and selling them on Instagram. Ring Concierge designs hundreds of engagement rings a year, with sales starting at $10,000 and reaching as high as six figures.\n\nWhen asked about common mistakes that people make when buying diamonds, Wegman said it comes down to which details clients spend their money on.\n\n\"I hate when people overspend on things that you can't see,\" Wegman told Business Insider. \"If someone is paying for all of these little details in the diamond and maybe the diamond is perfect but it is tiny, it's not necessary.\"\n\n\"You're walking around with a piece of fine jewelry, so let's just focus on what it's actually going to look like,\" she continued.\n\nRead more:A woman who sells 6-figure engagement rings through Instagram says there's a big misconception about the 4 C's of buying diamonds\n\nThe first detail Wegman focuses on is the diamond. She said several clients come to her with a misconception about the four C's of diamonds \u2014 cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. If clients spend too much time obsessing over the four C's, they get caught up in minute details and won't end up with what they ultimately want: a bigger diamond, Wegman said.\n\n\"I always suggest dropping lower in color and clarity and allocating a bit more of the budget toward carat weight\" she said. \"So we like to find ways to drop down on the paperwork a little bit, not have it impact the diamond visually and then just get them a large carat weight which ultimately the woman wants.\"\n\nThe shape of the ring makes a big difference in the price tag, too.\n\n\"Round cost 25% more than all other shapes. So, when we explain that to them and we show them 'here's an oval that's 25% less,' and actually appears larger than the round, they start to gravitate towards these other shapes,\" Wegman said.\n\nUltimately, the Ring Concierge team aims to be the female voice in appointments and to ensure clients are getting the biggest bang for their buck.\n\n\"We can help guide the men to purchase rings that we would like because we know that's probably what their girlfriend is going to like,\" Wegman said. \"We've never had a girl come back in and say he went too big.

Typically, a standard homeowners insurance policy will include coverage in the event of a fire.\n\n\"As long as you've been paying your premiums, the standard homeowner's insurance policy covers fire damage to your home, structures on your property, and most of your belongings,\" reported Darla Mercado of CNBC. The exception is specialty items, like art or jewelry, that might need a rider for coverage, she added.\n\nHowever, it's possible you'll need to pay more for additional coverage if you live in a high-risk area or if you're not able to find coverage in the open market.\n\nIn this case, you can get insurance through surplus lines \u2014 policies that protect against financial risks regular insurance companies won't take on and aren't required to follow same state regulations, according to the AP.\n\nAs a last resort, there's the California FAIR plan. They cover up to $1.5 million for a structure and its contents in high-risk properties, according to the Los Angeles Times, but that's basic coverage \u2014 \"in some cases [it] won't be enough for full replacement of a lost home and property,\" wrote LA Times reporter David Lazarus.\n\nWhat does fire insurance cover?\n\nWhether you have basic coverage with the California FAIR plan, or you have limitations on your homeowner's policy, it's important to know the extent of your coverage.\n\n\"If your whole house burned down, it used to be that you had guaranteed replacement,\" J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America, told CNBC. \"Insurers started to rethink this and apply an absolute limit on what they will pay.\"\n\nA \"replacement cost\" of your home covers the cost of a damaged home with a similar home, but some insurance companies can limit that at 20% over the face value of the policy, explained Mercado.\n\nThis can be particularly problematic in a largely damaged area, which can result in an uptick in prices, Hunter said. He added that insurers may also not cover additional expenses of \"bringing your damaged home up to new building codes.\"\n\nLazarus recommends purchasing an extended replacement cost endorsement, which covers extras above the policy limit in the event of any unexpected cost increases, and additional coverage for code-upgrade insurance to cover other things a basic policy might not protect.\n\nIf you're unhappy with your claim, you can always make a complaint to the insurer's consumer relations department, state insurance department, or a lawyer, said Hunter. Just don't forget to note your communication for evidence during a dispute.\n\nHow do you file a claim after a fire?\n\nAs with any kind of insurance, the first step to filing an insurance claim is documentation.\n\n\"I strongly advise homeowners and renters to take their smartphones and walk around their homes shooting a video of their belongings,\" Lazarus wrote. \"This can provide helpful evidence if an insurer disputes, say, that you owned a state-of-the-art home-theater setup.\"\n\nKeep these images on a computer drive or iCloud so they're accessible from virtually anywhere. Lazarus also recommends saving receipts, such as those from hotel rooms, food, and rentals in the event that your home is uninhabitable, for any additional living expenses (ALE) coverage your insurance policy covers.\n\nHunter told CNBC that to have your claim processed as soon as possible, immediately report it and note the claim number.\n\nThe insurer will then send a claims adjust or for damage assessment. Hunter recommended using a local contractor as a guideline to use for an estimate, which can help you negotiate with your insurance company's contractor (who you're not required to use).", "Getty\n\nA new study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that limiting one's social media usage to 30 minutes per day can lead to significant improvement's in well-being.\n\nSpecifically, less time scrolling through photos of friends and old high school acquaintances can lower rates depression and loneliness.\n\nThe study \u2014 which was published in December's Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology \u2014 was one of the first to show a cause-and-effect relationship between social media usage and mental health issues. Most studies previously on the subject have shown only a correlation between the two.\n\nIn the study, 143 undergraduate students were tested over the course of two semesters. The students were either put into a group that was instructed to limit their social media usage on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat to 30 minutes per day, total, with 10 minutes each per platform, or assigned to a control group, where they were allowed to carry on with their normal social media habits.\n\nAfter three weeks, the students were asked questions to assess their mental health across seven different areas, including: social support, fear of missing out (also known as FOMO), loneliness, autonomy and self-acceptance, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.\n\n\"Here's the bottom line,\" the lead researcher for the study, Melissa Hunt, told Science Daily. \"Using less social media than you normally would leads to significant decreases in both depression and loneliness.

On the sides of the aircraft are a pair of lethal PL-10 short-to-intermediate-range air-to-air missiles that could prove useful in a dogfight, as well as engagements on the edge of visual range.\n\nThe government-controlled Global Times, citing Chinese experts, argued that \"the move displayed the J-20's superiority\" over US stealth fighters like the F-35 and F-22 and the growing confidence of the People's Liberation Army.\n\nChinese experts criticized the F-22 for its outdated technology and the F-35 for its inherent defects. One expert, Song Zhongping, previously commented that \"the J-20 will engage with rivals in the future who dare to provoke China in the air.\"\n\nWhile the Chinese stealth fighter has participated in combat training exercises, the J-20, unlike its American counterparts, has never been deployed in actual combat.\n\nThe aircraft lacks the all-aspect stealth expected of a true fifth-generation fighter, and it is also held back by its inferior engine technology. The aircraft was expected to receive a new engine, but it remains unreliable in testing, indicating that for now, the pride of the Chinese air force continues to depend on Russia for its engine technology.\n\nWith upgraded engines, the J-20 will likely become a much more capable weapon.", "The human brain has 100 billion neurons making trillions of connections \u2014 but somehow, you still can't remember your new coworker's name.\n\n\"I remember things in ridiculous ways,\" Dr. Sudip Bose told Business Insider. \"I mean, I have a mnemonic to get dressed in the morning, like UPS: underwear, pants, socks.\"\n\nIn 2002, Dr. Bose achieved a near-perfect score on the medical-board exam, out-scoring 3,650 other test takers. To prepare, he would quiz himself frequently, spacing out information and scrambling the order in which he learned it. Dr. Bose is also a former major in the US Army (he's an Iraq War veteran known for treating Saddam Hussein after US capture), and he told Business Insider a lot of his memorization techniques came from military training \u2014 he would picture his drill sergeant in front of him when he studied.\n\nToday, he uses the memory tricks he learned as a student to remember names or give presentations as a public speaker. Here are his go-to strategies:\n\nFirst of all, relax\n\nA lot of learning is unconscious, and relaxing about a subject makes it easier to learn.\n\n\"If you're like 'I gotta memorize this, I gotta memorize this,' it makes it harder. So, I think one thing is finding relaxation,\" Dr. Bose said.\n\nMake the information matter to you\n\nWhen Dr. Bose was in high school, he said history bored him to the point of drooling puddles over his textbook. But as he learned more about his connections to history \u2014 his father was a history buff, and his grandfather was a freedom fighter in India \u2014 he began to care more.\n\nAnd medicine, he remembers, became very real to him when he went into combat. \"I have to learn this stuff,\" he remembers telling himself, \"because someone is going to be in front of me, and they'll die if I don't know it.\"\n\nRead more: I'm an ER doctor who runs my own company, and my best health advice and business advice is the same\n\nCreate visual or sensory association\n\n\"Work with the memory,\" he said. \"Think of the memory like a scratch pad or dry erase board and play with it. Make associations, draw pictures \u2014 not just reading with a highlighter, but actively working with the material. And then when you're working with it, make associations: visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory.\"\n\nPay attention to what you're learning\n\nIt may seem obvious, but Dr. Bose said it's important to pay attention in the first place.\n\n\"We've all been in that situation where it's like, 'Hey I'm Tom, nice to meet you,' da da da and 30 seconds later you're like, 'what was his name again?'\"\n\nHe continued: \"You have to focus on the person's name, actually pay attention when they're saying it, and then you have to repeat it. Like, 'Hey, what do you do Tom? Do you prefer Tom or Thomas?'\"\n\nRepeat it\n\nIt's easy to remember something for a few minutes, or even hours, at a time. It's much harder to recall your memories after time has passed.\n\n\"Sitting there reading it with a highlighter underlining, there's only so far that will go,\" Dr. Bose said. \"Maybe that will get it into short-term memory, but then allow yourself to forget it and be retested on it \u2014 and in a different format.\"\n\nHe compared it to learning a dance routine: Instead of practicing from the beginning every time, it's more effective to practice small pieces out of order until you're familiar with each combination of steps.\n\nEmbrace the discomfort of learning\n\n\"The people who struggle more with the knowledge actually remember it more,\" Dr. Bose said. He explained that quizzing or repeated testing (though uncomfortable!) makes a big difference in whether you can recall something later.\n\n\"When I study something,\" he continued, \"I work with the material, I apply it to something, I relax about it, I test, I forget it, and then come back to it, and really work with the discomfort of being like 'shoot, I don't remember this.'\"\n\n\"Whatever your career is, or if you're just living your life, the act of learning, lifelong learning, and memorization is a big component,\" said Dr. Bose. \"It never stops.\"", "Holding out for a PlayStation 4 this holiday?

Apple also provided lukewarm guidance for the all-important holiday quarter.\n\nThe driver of the projected sales slump is that Apple's new $749 phone, the lower-end iPhone XR, might not be the hot seller that Apple had hoped, and the company may be cutting orders for the device. Nikkei reported earlier this month that Foxconn had cut as many as 15 production lines for the device.\n\nNow, that's being backed up by new reports by analysts from JPMorgan and TF International Securities.\n\n\"We now forecast modest y/y declines in iPhone shipments for both calendar 2018 and 2019 on account of a weaker macro backdrop in emerging market,\" Samik Chatterjee and other JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note distributed to clients on Monday, blaming the weak iPhone shipments on weak consumer confidence in emerging markets.\n\n\"Led by the softer backdrop in the [emerging markets], the better than expected response to the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS MAX (the higher-end phones) is unable to entirely offset the more tepid than expected consumer response to iPhone XR (launched recently),\" the analysts continued, downgrading their price target for Apple stock to $266 from $270.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had similar observations in a note released on Monday.\n\n\"We have reduced our iPhone XR shipment estimation from 100mn units to 70mn during the new product lifecycle,\" Kuo wrote, citing reduced Chinese consumer confidence stemming from the trade war, high prices, and competition from Huawei. However, Apple's less-expensive older phones may get a sales boost from the weak iPhone XR.\n\n\"The legacy iPhone models forecast is likely to increase significantly thanks to more affordable prices; the total iPhone shipments in 1Q19 are likely to see a YoY decline,\" Kuo continued, citing Career and Nissha Printing as two suppliers that might be affected by Apple's cuts.\n\nAnother data point potentially contributing to Apple's slide: Lumentum, a key supplier for parts that power facial recognition systems, said a large customer had cut its orders by 30% \u2014 and Apple is its top customer.\n\nThese data points come as fears emerge that there is weak demand for Apple's products in emerging markets, including China, partly driven by a strong dollar making iPhones more expensive.\n\nThe slide may also reflect concerns that Apple knows that iPhone unit sales are going to go negative in the short-term, which is why it decided to stop reporting unit sales. Apple said it preferred to focus on the company's transition to a services company, with regular recurring revenue.\n\n\"We believe these challenges are largely cyclical and investors should pay greater attention to the transformation to services, where Apple was able to report quarterly record revenue of $10 bn in [the most recent quarter] despite a regulatory challenge in China,\" the JPMorgan analysts write.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook was directly asked about this possibility during Apple's most recent conference call.\n\n\"Some people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are going to start going negative year over year because it's easier to talk about great things and not show the details of things that aren't so great,\" Citi analyst Jim Suva said during the conference call.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook responded:\n\n\"Jim, let me just add a couple things to that for color. Our installed base is growing at double digit, and that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and the customer loyalty, et cetera. The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says, or he says how many units you have in there?

UPI reports Ryanair passengers, who had already gone through passport control and security, were about to pass through the tarmac to board the plane when they were told to turn around and head back to the gate.\n\nBBC reports the French civil aviation authority grounded the flight at Bordeaux-M\u00e9rignac Airport as \"a last resort\" after a dispute over an unpaid debt of subsidies reached the sum of \u20ac525,000, or $590,000 dollars.\n\nRead More: Ryanair fires 6 crew members after a staged photo went viral of them sleeping on the airport floor\n\nAccording to BBC, the dispute of subsidies had to do with Ryanair's use of Angoul\u00eame Airport in France in 2008 and 2009 and payments made to the airline, which were later ruled to be illegal by the European Commission in Brussels.\n\nCNN reports a 2015 European Commission statement said, \"France must now recover the incompatible aid from the companies that received it in order to restore the level playing field.\"\n\nUPI reports the payments were deemed illegal because \"they gave Ryanair an unfair economic advantage.\"\n\nRyanair did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe Independent reports the plane was impounded, and the passengers were delayed up to five hours at the Bordeaux-M\u00e9rignac Airport.

They tend to be drawn from a relatively narrow pool: There have been two King Charleses and six King Georges. Philip is the name of Charles' father, while Arthur has been associated with British royalty since the days of legend.\n\nDue to a quirk of royal protocol, when Queen Elizabeth, dies Charles will have the opportunity to take any of his four names as his official \"regnal name,\" and could from then be known as King Philip, King Arthur, or King George.\n\nRead Business Insider's rundown of everything else that will happen when the Queen dies here.\n\nPrince of Wales\n\nThis title belongs to whoever is first in line to the throne. It dates back to 1300s, just after Wales was conquered by the English and ceased to be a separate kingdom. Charles is the 21st English Prince of Wales.\n\nChildren in Caerphilly, Wales, wave Welsh flags on a visit by Prince Charles.

Since the 1300s it has always belonged to the Prince of Wales.\n\nDuke of Cornwall\n\nThis title, the oldest dukedom in England, has automatically belonged to the heir to the throne since 1337. When in Southwest England, Charles is sometimes referred to by this title first.\n\nPrince Charles in front of a Duchy of Cornwall crest in Newquay, Cornwall. Getty Images\n\nUnlike the other titles, it comes with a large economic benefit: As duke, Charles owns some 150,000 acres, mainly in southwest England. Its 2017 accounts say the Duchy has assets totalling more than \u00a3913 million, and makes him \u00a320 million a year.\n\nDuke of Rothesay\n\nThis Scottish title is another longstanding possession of the heir to the throne. Before 1603, when the crowns of England and Scotland were joined, the Duke of Rothesay was the title given to the heir to Scotland's throne \u2014 post-1603, one heir has held them both.\n\nWhen in Scotland, Charles is frequently referred to as the Duke of Rothesay, like in the newspaper headline in the Scottish edition of The Times newspaper.\n\nThe Times\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton also have separate Scottish titles, as Business Insider explained last week.\n\nEarl of Carrick and Baron of Renfrew\n\nThese are two separate Scottish titles, which also go to the heir to the throne. Carrick and Renfrew both refer to southerly areas of Scotland. Before the crowns merged, the earldom of Carrick was associated with Robert the Bruce, a Scottish king who fought a war of independence against England.\n\nLord of The Isles\n\nThis title refers to the islands to the west of Scotland, which remained functionally independent from the mainland until around 1500. Parts of the territory still speak an entirely separate language, Scots Gaelic.\n\nOne of the islands, Lewis, is notable for being the original home of Gaelic speaker Mary Anne MacLeod, the mother of US President Donald Trump.\n\nCharles takes his Scottish heritage seriously, and can often be seen in a kilt. Getty Images\n\nThe lordship of the isles was given to the Scottish heir to the throne, and then later to the English, and therefore now belongs to Charles.\n\nPrince and Great Steward of Scotland\n\nCharles's last titles are also Scottish, and date from the medieval period. \"Prince of Scotland\" used to refer to a smaller area than the Scotland of today. The Great Steward used to be a separate noble title, but has belonged to the heir to the Scottish throne since 1371. It comes last in the official order of precedence.\n\nWhen Charles takes the throne, Prince William is likely to inherit almost all of the titles listed above, though he may not get them all immediately.", "Tesla customers who purchase a Model S sedan or Model X SUV will no longer receive credits for free charging at the automaker's Supercharger stations. Tesla's website says that some Model S and Model X vehicles purchased before November 2 come with 400 kWh of charging credits each year (which Tesla estimates will provide around 1,000 miles of range), indicating that vehicles purchased on or after November 2 do not come with charging credits.\n\nA Tesla representative told Business Insider that the automaker sometimes changes its Supercharger offerings to better reflect the value of its products. The representative added that customers who buy the Model S, Model X, or Model 3 sedan can receive six months of free Supercharger use if they buy their vehicle with a referral code from another customer.\n\nRead more: It's a complete myth that the rest of the auto industry is chasing Tesla\n\nTesla opened its first Supercharger stations in 2012 and allowed Tesla owners to use them for free until 2017, at which point it began offering customers 400 kWh of annual charging credits. Tesla offered free use of its Supercharging stations to customers who bought the performance version of the Model 3 before August, but did not offer free Supercharger use or Supercharger credits to other Model 3 customers.\n\nThe move to continue phasing out free Supercharger use comes as Tesla increases its focus on profitability. The automaker posted a surprise profit in the third quarter, beating analyst expectations with adjusted earnings of $2.90 per share (compared to an analyst forecast of $0.15 per share) on $6.8 billion in revenue (compared to an analyst forecast of $6.315 billion).

Benoit Tessier/Reuters\n\nOn October 31, Lime had recalled 2,000 Ninebot scooters after \"unconfirmed\" reports that some caught fire in at least three cities.\n\nNow the company has recalled an unknown number of scooters made by Chinese manufacturer Okai after users across multiple cities reported that the handlebars had fallen off. Users on social media in Portland, Denver and Baltimore in the US reported problems, as well as in Paris.\n\nContee, who spoke to Business Insider before the reports of broken handlebars emerged, said scooter hardware was \"nascent\" but said the firm was innovating on the way Lime's software made the vehicles safer. He pointed to the fact that Lime's scooters have a capped speed limit in certain places at night, and that in Prague scooters aren't permitted in \"high pedestrian\" areas.\n\nRead more: Lime issues its second scooter recall in less than a month\n\nContee suggested Lime's users were loyal because the company learns from its mistakes.\n\n\"Ultimately when you're trying to move in this space where it's so nascent, where no one has created a vehicle for this particular use... if you haven't made a core competency of being able to learn and take that feedback and iterate on hardware, then what can be done in six months of learning and [with] a different fleet type creates a loyalty you wouldn't have otherwise.\"\n\nWhen Business Insider asked Contee how he might reassure would-be scooter riders alarmed by the flimsiness of the devices, he said the firm had been transparent in what it's created.\n\nStill, Lime's terms of service state baldly: \"You agree that neither Lime nor the Released Persons are liable for any injury or death suffered by You while using the Services, whether or not You are wearing a helmet at the time of injury.\"\n\nScooter startups are worth billions, but there are lots of questions about the law and safety\n\nLime has clocked 20 million in the 18 months since its launched, and is worth $1.1 billion after raising $335 million from high-profile backers including Uber and Alphabet. Its biggest rivals include Bird, another US startup worth millions in backing, Europe's Taxify, and a host of smaller regional firms.\n\nAll of the firms are racing to lure as many users onto their apps as possible, and to offer different types of new city transport, with Lime also offering electric bikes and electric cars.\n\nBut regulation and safety are proving thorny problems for companies that are taking a leaf out of the Uber playbook and perhaps prioritizing speedy expansion over compliance.\n\nA US man died in September after falling off a Lime scooter and not wearing a helmet, while a class-action filed in the US in October accuses both Lime and Bird of \"gross negligence.\"\n\nMeanwhile, scooter startups have struggled to expand to Europe's biggest market, London, because their vehicles don't meet local regulatory standards. Business Insider revealed in August that both firms were hoping to see changes in UK law that would permit scooters on London roads.\n\nContee said Lime was \"pro-regulation\" and that the firm hoped to convince London's transport regulator, Transport for London, that it had created the best product.\n\nThe firm will introduce electric bikes to the UK, then plans to expand to other vehicles in time. \"We will work to create relationships based on that, and we will work over time to add vehicles.\"", "Sorry, Nintendo Wii users: the \"Wii Sports\" console is losing Netflix in January 2019.\n\nMore specifically, as of January 30, all online services for the Nintendo Wii will be sunset.

Others say sharing that level of access could become an issue if a current or former significant other wants to cause some serious damage.\n\nMany modern phones incorporate some level of biometric security \u2014 older iPhones use fingerprint technology while newer models use facial recognition, and plenty of Android phones utilize either method. This allows users to open their phones quickly without needing to remember or input a password, but additional fingerprints and faces can be granted access as well.\n\n\"I think that inherently, people desire to share themselves and to be known. Sharing your phone fingerprints demonstrates trust between two people, and that you are OK with being known by that person, and that they're OK with you knowing them too,\" said Emma Clarke, a 24-year-old who spoke with CNBC and has shared fingerprint access with a boyfriend in the past.\n\nHere's the reasoning some young couples gave CNBC for granting biometric access to a significant other:\n\nIt's convenient \u2014 you can switch songs while the other is driving, use apps that aren't on your phone, or use the phone for a task while the other is busy.\n\nIt's a display of trust and intimacy.\n\nOne person compared the action to putting a significant other in the \"top friends\" group on Myspace.\n\nHowever, phones are powerful tools that are connected to most aspects of our online lives, and providing someone that level of access could prove troublesome if the relationship deteriorates, or if people in the relationship have different definitions of privacy.

The Navigator continues to maintain its own identity.\n\nPower junkies might wonder how the 3.5-liter twin-turbo mill stacks up against the 5.4-liter V8 from the previous generation, but Lincoln did add the smaller engine to the lineup in 2015, so the market was prepared.\n\nI thought it performed admirably, and in my testing, I worked my way through all the drive modes and explored the various dimensions of the foul-weather setup, as a snowstorm swept into the New York and New Jersey area (the four-wheel-drive system can be tweaked to handle both moderate and deep snow). The Navigator brushed it off. The turbos also exhibited no lag, as the power came on strong no matter what.\n\nI pushed the limits of this big rig's people-toting capacity: six adults and two teenagers at one point. The six adults also made the run to Brooklyn and there were no complaints about comfort. Jaunts to the grocery store to provision my family of five were sort of comical. \"Is that all you've got?\" the 'Gator seemed to be asking.

It's safe to say the pressure was on in Cleveland.\n\nBut Mayfield has never been one to shy away from a big moment.

Martin.\n\nShe asked defensive end Myles Garrett when he started believing in his team's new quarterback, and Garrett responded with a clarifying question:\n\n\"You mean, in person, or on TV, when I saw him hold his crotch?\" Garrett asked. \"That's when I knew he was different, man. He had something to him.\"\n\nGarrett said Mayfield has brought that same attitude with him to the NFL.\n\n\"I mean, he's a d--- \u2026 when you have to play him,\" Garrett added with a smile. \"Even in practice, sometimes, I wanna chop him in the throat.

Amazon\n\nGrowing up, I remember spending long hours building houses with Lincoln Logs, Legos, and other building materials. I enjoyed the endless customization possibilities. Today, my kids still like their building blocks, but with the Information Age, screens are becoming a bigger draw. Fortunately, there are STEM learning toys that teach children to build in whole new ways that past generations could never dream of.\n\nMy sons, Jerome (15 years old) and Bucky (4 years old), love anything tech related. And both have experience with a variety of STEM learning tools. After seeing our review of the LittleBits Star Wars Droid Inventor Kit, Wonder Workshop wanted us to test out its Cue Coding Robot for free. Below is our experience with it.\n\nMy first experiences with the Cue Coding Robot\n\nAs soon as Cue was out of the box, the boys started having fun with it. This device is designed for ages 10 to 15, and I think my boys are just outside of the right age range. Bucky isn't able to read so he needed help using the robot. And, Jerome enjoyed it for a little bit, but it couldn't compete with video games and girls.\n\nThere are several accessories you can get to go with Cue, including the Sketch Kit, which we got to test out. The kit allows your child to mount a dry erase marker to the Cue and use the app to draw free form or preprogrammed shapes. There are activity cards that challenge your young one to mimic patterns.\n\nYou don't need any of these accessories to get going, though. You just need to charge the robot and have a Bluetooth-enabled device that supports the Cue by Wonder Workshop app. Right now, it works with iOS, Android, Chromebook, and Windows 10 systems. We tried the robot on Android and Windows 10. We could download the app to our Kindle Fire, but it appears the app won't be functional until later this month.\n\nHow the Cue Coding Robot performed\n\nJerome played with Cue nonstop for about three hours after we unboxed it. Bucky was in tow the whole time begging for his chance to play with it. And, they did play together a little bit, but the functions Jerome was interested in were over his brother's head. Eventually, the battery needed to be charged, and Jerome never revisited the robot. However, Bucky was just getting started.\n\nThere are virtually limitless ways to enjoy Cue:\n\nMissions \u2014 Broken up into Alien Contact, Treasure Hunt, and Hack3r Hijack, there are nine games within each mission that test your child's logic, math, and language skills.\n\n\u2014 Broken up into Alien Contact, Treasure Hunt, and Hack3r Hijack, there are nine games within each mission that test your child's logic, math, and language skills.

You can also move Cue around using a virtual joystick, kind of like a remote-control car. Create \u2014 Cue has an accelerometer, gyro, encoders, proximity sensors, and more that can be used to create adventures.\n\nThere are also four avatars with distinct personalities to choose from.\n\nWith a background in STEM and robotics, Jerome knew exactly what to do with Cue. I needed a little more help. Fortunately, there are detailed step-by-step tutorials that helped me up the learning curve.\n\nOne of the things I look for in any toy is if it will keep my child entertained for hours without help from me. Cue could do that at times. Bucky really enjoyed recording his voice and getting Cue to say what he recorded. He also liked it when I worked with him on missions. The missions and coding were challenging.\n\nI really like that as Bucky gets older, he'll continue to get more and more out of Cue. This is a toy that just keeps giving.\n\nWe've had Cue for over two months now, and Bucky still comes to me to ask if he can play with it at least once a week. We've had to limit his playing at times because he'd try to see if he could destroy the robot by sending it down our hardwood stairs. Cue has done an impressive job of not breaking down.\n\nSome concerns about the robot\n\nMy biggest issue with Cue was trying to code on my Android phone. The screen only affords so much space, and it was hard to drag and drop items with limited room. This process was a lot easier using my PC, but the phone had a lot more functionality. Plus, it allowed me to be more mobile. If your child has access to an iPad or Bluetooth-enabled Chromebook, they may find the coding to be less tedious.\n\nThe Bluetooth range is relatively short. If you're in the same room as Cue, then you shouldn't have a problem. But, if you're trying to pull a prank on your kids from elsewhere in the house, you'll likely have issues because of the limited range.\n\nLastly, if you are trying to cut down on your child's screen time, Cue is not a good option since they must use a Bluetooth-enabled device in order to play with it. However, the screen time really is education, and it takes them away from video games or the crap on YouTube.\n\nBottom line\n\nA great STEM toy will teach your child, is fun, and has a wealth of programs, missions, and other tasks that will keep them coming back for more. The Cue Coding Robot exhibits all of these features.\n\nThough the recommended age range is 10 to 15 years old, I strongly believe it can serve as an excellent learning tool for kids under 10 as well. And, for the years of entertainment it will provide, the $179 price tag for the Wonder Workshop Cue Coding Robot is relatively affordable.", "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nCraig Federighi is in charge of two of Apple's flagship software products, iOS and MacOS. In many ways, he is the face of Apple's software.\n\nBack in June, Federighi was also the star of Apple's WWDC keynote, which was 130 minutes long; Federighi spoke for roughly half the time, presenting for a whopping 55 minutes.\n\nAfter that keynote, Wired's Lauren Goode asked Federighi about some of Apple's plans mentioned during the presentation. And then this happened (emphasis ours):\n\nWhen addressing my question about whether iOS apps moving to macOS is a natural precursor to touchscreen Macs, Federighi told me he's \"not into touchscreens\" on PCs and doesn't anticipate he ever will be. \"We really feel that the ergonomics of using a Mac are that your hands are rested on a surface, and that lifting your arm up to poke a screen is a pretty fatiguing thing to do,\" he said.\n\nWhat's curious here is that while Federighi is attempting to denounce touchscreen PCs by saying that \"lifting your arm up to poke a screen is a pretty fatiguing thing to do,\" he's unwittingly explaining why the iPad is not a great replacement for laptop or desktop computers.\n\nEven though Federighi is clearly talking about Mac computers in that quote, you could basically replace \"using a Mac\" with \"doing work\" and the phrase still makes sense, since you're often using a Mac or PC to do work.\n\nApple wants you to do work on an iPad and iPad Pro, but doing that requires \"lifting your arm up to poke a screen,\" as Federighi puts it. Even with the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard thrown in, your main input mode still requires touching the screen.\n\nIn recent years, Apple has pushed the idea of using an iPad for more than just passive activities like reading or watching videos. Apple added a ton of productivity-focused features for the iPad in iOS 11, including multi-tasking, a dock, a file system, and drag and drop \u2014 very laptop-y features. And if you didn't think the iPad sounded enough like a work machine after that, consider Apple's two iPad Pro models, with their fast chips and support of unique work tools that only work with iPads, like the $180 Smart Keyboard and $130 Apple Pencil.\n\nAnd then of course, who could forget Apple's \"What's A Computer?\" ad for the iPad?\n\nApple\n\nMaybe you didn't see the ad. It features a young girl drawing on her iPad, texting on her iPad, taking pictures with her iPad, reading comics on her iPad \u2014 you know, kid stuff. At the end of the ad, a friendly neighbor sees the young girl on the grass, with her iPad propped up by a Smart Cover, and mistakes it for a laptop. She says, \"Whatcha doing on your computer?\" And the little girl says, \"What's a computer?\"\n\nEven if Apple doesn't say the exact words, it's very clear the company doesn't want you to think of the iPad as just a big, pretty screen. They want you to know the iPad can also do work \u2014 real work. It also costs about as much as a laptop \u2014 the new iPad Pro models can cost even more than a MacBook Pro.\n\nExcept, Federighi himself says that \"lifting your arm up to poke a screen is a pretty fatiguing thing to do.\"\n\nMaybe both parties are right. Maybe the iPad can do real work, but it does get fatiguing after awhile. If only Apple let the iPad support mice and trackpads, it could be a true laptop replacement; for now, buying an iPad to do work means you're going to be lifting your arm to touch that screen a lot.", "Apple/YouTube\n\nApple facial-recognition supplier Lumentum slashed its quarterly outlook, citing a reduced shipment request from one of its biggest customers.\n\nIn an annual filing, Lumentum listed Apple as its largest customer, contributing 30% of its revenue.\n\nLast week, Nikkei reported that Apple canceled a production boost for its iPhone XR model due to disappointing demand.\n\nWatch Apple trade live.\n\nApple was sliding Monday, down as much as 5%, after Lumentum, one of its facial-recognition suppliers, slashed its outlook for the quarter, citing a reduced shipment request from one of its biggest customers.\n\nLumentum makes special lasers, called vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), which are a key component of 3D sensors that could support some features of Apple's new iPhones, such as FaceID and augmented reality.\n\nOn Monday, the laser manufacturer cut its second-quarter outlook, saying it now sees revenue in the range of $335 million to $355 million, down from $405 million to $430 million.

Teamsters represent those 11,600 UPS Freight workers.\n\n\"We will resume normal operations and will immediately begin accepting new volume from UPS Freight customers,\" UPS said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nThe passing of this agreement avoids a strike that would have halted UPS Freight shipments. The last time UPS saw a work stoppage was in 1997.\n\nAccording to Teamsters, 84% of UPS Freight workers in the union voted. Seventy-seven percent voted yes on the contract after months of negotiating.\n\nMost consumers don't interact with UPS Freight, which moves goods within the supply chain and is separate from the small-package unit that makes deliveries to people's homes. UPS Freight moved 2.8 billion pounds of goods in the last quarter, FreightWaves reported.\n\nWhile UPS Freight doesn't come right to your home, a work stoppage in that division would still up the prices of your holiday goods, we reported last week. Shippers would not be able to deliver goods on time and would have to find pricier, last-minute alternatives in the case of a strike.\n\nStill, not all UPS Freight workers are pleased\n\nUPS Freight workers told Business Insider that the contract didn't provide enough protection against UPS Freight hiring subcontracted workers, who are not unionized and are typically paid less than full-time employees.\n\nThey also said they've noticed their benefits being reduced with each contract, which are negotiated for workers on behalf of Teamsters.\n\nMilwaukee-based Curt Siekert, who has been a UPS Freight driver for 13 years, said he and his coworkers used to receive 401(k) matching, health-insurance coverage during work stoppages, and other stipulations. Now, he said, their labor contracts don't cover those benefits.\n\nThere is also a multitier wage structure in this contract that allows employees to start at a rate that's close to what more senior employees make. For instance, starting clerical workers are receiving a $2 raise, while workers who have been with UPS for 36 or 48 months are receiving only a $0.50 raise.\n\nRead more: A day in the life of a NYC Coca-Cola delivery truck driver, who gets to work at 4 a.m. and spends his morning pushing 175-pound carts full of bottles through Penn Station\n\n\"The contract pretty much caters to the new employees,\" Tanya Finley, a UPS Freight employee in Orlando, Florida, told Business Insider.\n\nUPS counters that their freight drivers are among the most well paid in the industry.

And a new survey indicates the success of that initiative will give Netflix room to raise prices.\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm Piper Jaffray conducted a survey, released on Monday, of over 1,100 Netflix users and found that the majority thought the quality of Netflix's original content has improved in the past year. This factor, along with several others, makes a price hike likely, according to the analysts.\n\n\"It would not be surprising to see Netflix bump pricing up across many of its markets in 2019,\" Piper Jaffray said in the report.\n\nThe analysts said the \"primary determinant in the ability of Netflix to raise price is subscriber perception of content quality.\"\n\n\"We surveyed >1,100 domestic Netflix subscribers and found that 71% of them feel that Netflix content has improved in the past year,\" the analysts continued. \"We believe, as long as the vast majority of subscribers perceive that the service is improving, Netflix will be positioned to periodically increase prices.\"\n\nThe survey found subscribers in the US \"would be willing to pay ~40% more for their Netflix subscription today.\"\n\nRead more: New data shows the winners and losers in streaming TV this year \u2014 and it's good news for Disney as it enters the battle for subscribers\n\nThe analysts also pointed to Netflix's emergence this year as an Oscar contender. Netflix has made waves as it pushes its awards favorite, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Roma,\" in the Oscar race. It plans to release the film in at least 100 theaters, one of the largest theatrical distributions for one of its movies (even though it will not be released at Alamo Drafthouse).\n\n\"While the allure for many Netflix subs has been episodic (series) content, Oscar nominations for upcoming Netflix films would, no doubt, have a favorable impact on existing and potential subscribers' view of the content being made available to them,\" the analysts said.\n\nAs Netflix focuses on its library of original content, it is also beefing up its global presence. Analysts predict that Netflix could gain approximately 187 million worldwide users by 2020 as it penetrates markets that have seen slow growth, such as in Asia, where Netflix recently announced 17 new original shows and movies mostly hailing from Japan and India (China is not included in those estimates, as Netflix can't operate out of the country without a local partner).\n\n\"While this level of penetration would be higher than any other comparative subscription entertainment product, we believe the content/value ratio offered by Netflix is, and will continue to be, higher than any other relevant comparative offering,\" the analysts said.\n\nMore and more consumers are getting comfortable with streaming, as well. A recent report from Ampere Analysis found that older viewers making the switch helped drive subscriber growth for Netflix and Hulu this year.\n\nBut Netflix will face increased competition in the coming year. AT&T is releasing a new service next year that will include HBO, and Disney just revealed more details about its service, Disney+, expected to drop in late 2019.", "Matt Kuchar won his first tournament in four years on Sunday, taking the Mayakoba Golf Classic by one stroke over Danny Lee.\n\nKuchar shot an astounding 22-under over four days in Mexico, earning his first win since the 2014 Heritage Classic.\n\nMaking Kuchar's victory even more impressive is that he did it without his regular caddie, John Wood. Kuchar was a late entry to the field at Mayakoba, and according to Golf Digest, Wood had already RSVP'd to a reunion, leaving Kuchar in need of a last-second replacement.\n\nTournament director Joe Mazzeo recommended caddie coordinator David Giral Ortiz, known by his nickname \"El Tucan,\" to take over on Kuchar's bag.\n\nWhile Ortiz doesn't speak much English, he and Kuchar paired well together, with Kuchar opening the tournament with two stellar rounds.

The interior ring will be cylindrically cut out for the desired smoothness using a micrometer thick water jet inside which a laser beam is cast.

A great winter coat will keep you warm, dry, and looking good, too.\n\nWinter is coming, and depending on where you live, that means freezing temperatures, snow, rain, and biting wind that always seems to find the gap between your pants and jacket. But just because the winter weather can be unrelentingly savage, that's no reason not to get outside and get on with your day. With the right winter coat, you can keep the chill at bay while you work or play, and you can even look good while you're at it.\n\nThe primary job of a winter coat is pretty straightforward: It needs to keep you warm. This is both a comfort and a safety matter, so make sure to consider the insulation capabilities of a winter jacket over all other factors. It's better to not to die of exposure than it is to look good, so you might have to sacrifice style for welfare. Keep in mind that water resistance plays a big role in warmth. A sodden jacket loses most of its insulation capacity, so if you live in or frequently visit areas with lots of precipitation, you need a jacket that is waterproof (or at least highly water resistant) to ensure that you'll remain warm enough.\n\nYou also need to be able to complete a given set of tasks without your coat impeding your abilities. You wouldn't go skiing or work on a construction site in a wool pea coat because the material would restrict your motion and also there's the whole looking ridiculous thing. But you also wouldn't wear a super puffy 800-fill down parka while meeting your friends for a drink in the city on a chilly but clear winter evening. That would be overkill and also look a bit silly. So also make sure to consider when and where you'll wear your coat in terms beyond the environmental factors.\n\nThe good news is that lots of men's winter coats are warm, water-resistant, and stylish. Once you have assessed a jacket and determined that it meets your needs in terms of safety and performance, you should absolutely shop based on looks. After all, your winter jacket is the garment people see any time you are out and about in those colder months. Read on to see which of our picks is best for your needs.\n\nHere are the best men's winter coats you can buy:\n\nUpdated on 11/12/2018 by Owen Burke: Added the Woolrich Peacoat and Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven Kyl Parka.

According to GfK, the average price of pet food increased from $1.71 a pound in 2011 to $2.55 a pound by the end of 2017.\n\nEach year, the total amount spent on pets has increased as owners pamper these creatures more. According to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), US pet owners spent $69.5 billion on their pets last year, up from $66.75 billion in 2016 and $41.2 billion in 2007.", "An American Airlines flight attendant is suing the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline over what she describes as a physical fight with another crew member aboard a plane in June 2016, multiple sources have reported.\n\nAccording to the Dallas Morning News the flight attendant, Kathy Ida Wolfe, claims in a lawsuit filed in federal court on Friday that the other crew member, Laura Powers, \"maliciously dug her fingernails into my arm and slammed the door of a beverage cart on my arm.\"\n\nThe Morning News reports that Wolfe said Powers \"grabbed my scarf, choking me, and dragged me in the aisle and in front of the passengers.\"\n\nNewsweek reports that both Wolfe and Powers were employed by the airline in June 2016 and that Powers has been an employee of the airline since 1985.\n\nRead more: The 15 worst airports in America: RANKED\n\nThe Morning News reports that Wolfe said she followed American Airlines protocol by reporting the incident to the captain, other flight attendants, and the flight service manager. But Wolfe claims American Airlines did not investigate the incident, so she filed a lawsuit against Powers and the airline. The lawsuit was originally filed in June in Tarrant County district court before being filed in federal court.\n\nReached by Business Insider, an American Airlines spokesman, Ross Feinstein, declined to comment on the specific allegations, saying only that American Airlines \"strives to create a work environment in which all team members feel safe and respected.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, attorneys for both American Airlines and Powers responded to the initial Tarrant County lawsuit by stating \"not liable because Plaintiff caused or contributed to cause the harm for which recovery of damages is sought.\"\n\nThe Morning News reports Wolfe's lawsuit against American Airlines and Powers includes allegations of negligence, dangerous work environment, breach of contract, and assault and battery and is seeking damages of up to $1 million.", "Following is the transcript of the video.\n\nThe US has an epidemic on its hands. Peanut allergies. Between 1997 and 2008, the number of American children with a peanut allergy has tripled. And today, an estimated 1.8 million kids in the US have one. That's larger than the entire population of Philadelphia. And the US is not alone. The UK, Canada, and Australia have seen a similar rise in child peanut allergies. But, that's not the case for other countries like China, Thailand, Korea, the Philippines, and Israel.\n\nSo, what do these countries have that the US doesn't? In Israel, there is a joke that the first three words out of every toddler's mouth are: abba, which means dad, ima, which means mom, and Bamba. Bamba is a popular peanuty snack. An estimated 90% of Israeli families buy it on a regular basis. And guess what? The peanut allergy rate in Israel is 1/10 the rate that it is in the UK. And in China and Thailand, many children eat peanut rice porridge for breakfast. And wouldn't you know it? Peanut allergies are relatively low there too.\n\nBut this could be a coincidence, right? Thank goodness we have the researchers at King's College London. They recruited 640 infants 4 to 10 months old who were at risk of developing a peanut allergy. Half of the kids in the study ate peanut snacks regularly. Whereas the other half were told to avoid peanuts entirely.\n\nThen when the kids were 5 years old, they were brought in for one final experiment. All of them were instructed to eat some type of peanut protein. Of the kids who ate peanut snacks regularly since infancy, 3.2% had developed a peanut allergy. But the kids who avoided peanuts altogether, were much worse off. More than 17% of them had developed an allergy to a nut that they had never consumed. That means they were six times more likely to develop a peanut allergy than kids who regularly ate peanuts. Of course, this is just one study. But if you know how allergies work, it begins to make sense.\n\nWhen someone with a peanut allergy encounters a peanut for the first time, their immune system kicks into overdrive. In this case, it sees the peanut as a threat. And it produces antibodies in anticipation for a future encounter. So the next time this person eats a peanut, antibodies activate an immune response which the person experiences as an allergic reaction.\n\nScientists aren't sure why some people experience reactions and others don't. But they think that early exposure can certainly help at-risk infants. And luckily, allergies aren't always set in stone. In a clinical trial earlier this year, doctors recruited children with peanut allergies. They gave them a small dose of peanut powder and slowly increased the dose over time. Sure enough, the children's immune systems became accustomed to the powder and nearly all of them were able to build up a tolerance to it.\n\nThis process, called desensitization, is a way of tricking your immune system. And it could, if used correctly and safely, become a way to treat children who have a mild reaction to peanuts. And although results have been promising so far, these treatments are not a cure. What's more, scientists suspect that genetics may also play a role in allergy development.\n\nSo, before you take matters into your own hands and start feeding your babies peanuts, talk to a doctor and make sure that you're in the clear. After all, like everything in life, peanuts should be enjoyed in moderation.", "North Korea has at least a dozen, possibly more, secret ballistic missile bases hidden in the mountains, a Washington-based think tank reported Monday.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies \u2014 relying on satellite photos, as well as interviews with defectors and defense and intelligence officials from around the world \u2014 has identified 13 of an estimated 20 undeclared missile operating bases.\n\nThe new \"Beyond the Parallel\" report says \"these missile operating bases ... can be used for all classes of ballistic missile from short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) up to and including intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\"\n\nThese weapons, many of which were developed as part of an energized program over the past few years, are capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads.\n\nThe undeclared missile bases are, notably, not launch sites. Rather, they appear to be focused on the preservation of the North's missile arsenal in the event of a preemptive strike.\n\nNorth Korea \"engages in an aggressive camouflage, concealment, and deception program with regard to its ballistic missile force,\" the CSIS report says.\n\nThe bases, according to experts, tend to be \"rudimentary in nature\" and feature underground tunnels for the storage of transporter erector launchers (TELs) and mobile erector launchers (MELs) that could be rolled out and dispersed to pre-prepared launch sites.\n\nThe operating bases are scattered across the country, typically located in small mountain valleys, the report said. The one closest to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the Sakkanmol base in the \"tactical belt,\" is said to house a SRBM unit, one that could accommodate more capable medium-range ballistic missiles if necessary.\n\nThe revelation, reportedly long known to American intelligence agencies, is the latest in a string of reports potentially indicating that North Korea is not fully living up to the expectations of the Trump administration, which demands the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nWhile the administration has celebrated North Korea's self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons and ballistic missile testing, the closure of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, the partial dismantling of the Sohae missile engine testing facility, and the return of American hostages, North Korea has yet to walk the path of disarmament desired by Washington.\n\nThis past summer, roughly one month after the historic Singapore summit where President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time, reports surfaced indicating that the country continues producing missiles, producing nuclear fuel at secret enrichment sites, and making improvements to key nuclear and missile facilities.\n\nFurthermore, North Korea has repeatedly rejected US requests for a detailed and accurate disclosure of the country's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. Last week, Pyongyang canceled talks with Washington, further complicating the Trump administration's efforts to secure lasting denuclearization.\n\nAfter the landmark summit in Singapore, Trump tweeted that \"there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.\"", "After just 12 games, it appears Carmelo Anthony may be on the move from the Houston Rockets in a somewhat bizarre turn of events.\n\nAnthony, who signed a one-year, $2.4 million deal with the Rockets this summer, has struggled this year, averaging 13 points on 40% shooting with 5 rebounds per game. The Rockets, who lost some key players in free agency, have struggled early, too, getting off to a 5-7 start after winning 65 games last season.\n\nOn Saturday, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowksi reported that Anthony met with the Rockets to discuss his role going forward. The New York Times' Marc Stein followed up on that on Sunday by saying Anthony had most likely played his last game with the Rockets.\n\nRockets GM Daryl Morey denied the reports, calling them \"unfair\" to Anthony, who Morey said has embraced any role asked of him by the Rockets. Head coach Mike D'Antoni deferred to Morey for any Anthony-related questions after the Rockets beat the Indiana Pacers, 115-103, on Sunday.\n\nIn the wake of the reports, some NBA players have come to Anthony's defense, as some of the Rockets' struggles have been pinned on him. If the Rockets do waive Anthony, he would be looking for his fifth team in fewer than two years.\n\nRead more:Here are the new, sleek NBA 'City' uniforms that all 30 teams will be wearing\n\nDwyane Wade, a friend of Anthony's, defended him on Twitter.\n\nLeBron James echoed the message, as did some other players.\n\nFormer NBA player and current ESPN analyst Stephen Jackson went off in a video he posted on Instagram, saying that there are far worse players and far worse teammates in the NBA than Anthony.\n\n\"They're trying to blackball Melo and push him out the league and make sure it looks like he can't play no more or make sure it looks like every team he goes to he's a problem or a cancer on the team in the locker room, which is so far from being true\" Jackson said.\n\n\"I can name 50 people Melo's better than right now in the NBA. I can name 50 people he's a better teammate than. Don't believe this narrative that they're trying to put out there that Melo's just a cancer and he can't play and he just makes every team bad. That's BS.\"\n\nThe New York Knicks traded Anthony to the Oklahoma City Thunder before the 2017-18 season. After one year with the Thunder, Anthony was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, who bought out his contract, allowing him to sign with the Rockets.\n\nIt's unclear if Anthony will have more suitors should leave the Rockets, but clearly, he hasn't brought what teams are looking for in his most recent stops.", "The stock market's so-called Red October was a tough time for investors of all shapes and sizes. But few parties felt the pain like hedge funds, which turned in a rocky month for the ages.\n\nA large universe tracked by Hedge Fund Research lost almost 3% in October, its worst month since May 2010, when the eurozone debt crisis was the major issue facing markets. In October, hedge funds had their worst month since 2010. JPMorgan\n\nBut it was the turmoil that raged under the surface of that massive hedge fund universe last month that should have investors worried. While the market's previous period of turbulence in February was largely driven by technical factors, a study from JPMorgan suggests Red October was far more based on fundamentals.\n\nStocks weren't just punished by the price-insensitive machinations of quantitative strategies this time. What occurred instead is a very real shift in sentiment that could continue to hamper hedge funds through 2019, the firm says.\n\nThis dynamic manifested intself in the $900 billion universe of equity long/short funds. When stocks underwent a major rotation \u2014 with proven leaders rolling over and laggards outperforming \u2014 it proved to be a toxic combination for these investors.\n\nThey wound up losing more than 4% in October, their worst month since January 2016, according to JPMorgan data.\n\n\"Such underperformance was likely accompanied by significant de-risking,\" a group of JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a client note.\n\nAnother group of hedge funds \u2014 one designed to recalibrate risk on the fly depending on market gyrations \u2014 also struggled in October. Known as risk-parity funds, they lost 5%, their most since June 2013, as stocks, bonds, and commodities sold off simultaneously, depriving them of safe havens. Under normal circumstances these asset classes aren't so closely correlated. In October, risk-parity funds had their worst month since 2013. JPMorgan\n\nOnce again, it was a shift toward more risk-averse, defensive holdings that spurred these losses. And what makes it scary for the future is that these are the types of allocation decisions often made by humans, rather than their machine-led counterparts.\n\nPerhaps most ominous of all are the questions this tough stretch of performance has raised for the future of hedge funds. JPMorgan estimates that the aging of the current market cycle, coupled with reluctance on behalf of investors to relive the October doldrums, will prompt them to pull money out.\n\nThe firm estimates that hedge funds will see \"significant but modest\" outflows of about $5 billion to $10 billion a quarter in 2019. At its worst, that would account for roughly $40 billion of capital removed.\n\nWhile that may be a drop in the bucket relative to the size of the market, it's a shift in the wrong direction for an industry that has grown in largely unabated fashion in recent years as the bull market has pushed into its 10th year.\n\nEven then, JPMorgan suggests that other headwinds will most likely be necessary if the stock market as a whole is going to take a notable dive lower. Still, regardless of whether those forces transpire and drag equities down, October's hedge fund meltdown is a strong signal that the industry is vulnerable to a sentiment shift.\n\n\"There is no doubt that potential hedge fund redemptions represent a headwind for equity markets going forward,\" Panigirtzoglou said. \"Similar to 2016, we expect that fundamentally-driven, equity-focused Equity Long/Short and Event Driven hedge funds will bear the brunt of hedge fund redemptions over the coming quarters.\"", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

The headset, which was previously only available to consumers and businesses in China, started shipping for $600 in these new markets last week.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nTo further enhance the appeal of the company's new enterprise headset, HTC also announced a new enterprise VR collaboration app, dubbed Vive Sync, that enables employees in different offices to meet in a VR environment.\n\nThe expansion is HTC's latest step in offering VR devices and packages aimed at the enterprise. HTC first delved into business-focused offerings by launching its Vive Business Edition package in 2016. And in April 2018, the company launched its business-focused PC-powered Vive Pro VR headset in the US.\n\nHTC will likely continue to release more offerings geared toward the enterprise to capitalize on the burgeoning market: The global enterprise VR hardware and software market is expected to explode 1,160% from $1 billion in revenue in 2018 to $12.6 billion in 2025, according to Tractica.\n\nThe stand-alone Vive Focus is an attractive option for enterprises, as it offers various benefits over HTC's PC-powered VR headsets:\n\nThe cost of ownership is significantly lower. Consumers using the Vive Focus only have to buy the $600 headset. However, the $400 HTC Vive and $800 Vive Pro also require high-powered PCs, which generally cost upwards of $1,000.\n\nIt boasts similar tracking capabilities. The Vive Focus offers six degrees of freedom (6DoF), enabling full positional headset tracking similar to the Vive and Vive Pro PC-powered headsets. This allows users to move in any direction in 3D digital space.\n\nIts setup process is simpler. Since the stand-alone device doesn't require PCs or any additional hardware, users simply have to put the device on to start using it. For comparison, the Vive and Vive Pro both require businesses to place various external sensors in a room to track users and connect several cables from the headset to the computer before using the device.", "OnePlus announced on Monday that it'll be releasing the \"Thunder Purple\" color option of the OnePlus 6T on November 15 in North American and Europe.\n\nThe Thunder Purple OnePlus 6T has a matte glass finish and will only be available with the $580 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage configuration. The cheaper $550 model, with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, only comes in the Mirror Black option with a glossy glass finish.\n\nOnePlus\n\nThere shouldn't be too much of a difference between the 6GB and 8GB RAM options, but heavy smartphone users may notice. RAM allows the phone to more easily keep recently opened apps running in the background so that they don't close when you move on to another app. When an app is closed because a phone has used up its available RAM, it usually takes longer to re-open that app when you return to it. Having more RAM makes the phone's performance feel faster, as it can keep more apps running in the background, and it opens apps right where you left off when you return to it rather than re-opening them.\n\nDespite being purple, the Thunder Purple OnePlus 6T won't be available at T-Mobile stores, where OnePlus has an exclusive carrier deal. The purple phone will only be available to buy from OnePlus' website. Otherwise, the Thunder Purple OnePlus 6T will work on T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon's network like the other OnePlus 6T models.\n\nThe OnePlus 6T is also available in a $630 model that comes in the matte Midnight Black color option with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.", "Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill stole the show Sunday.\n\nLiterally.\n\nAfter his second touchdown reception in the Chiefs' victory over the Arizona Cardinals, Hill celebrated by jumping into the stands and briefly manning the CBS TV camera. He directed the lens at the field just in time to capture the referee throwing a penalty flag in his direction for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nAnd here's the shot from Hill's vantage point behind the camera:\n\n\"Didn't [Terrell Owens] or Chad Johnson do that?'' Hill said, per ESPN's Adam Teicher. \"Didn't one of those guys do that? That's probably why I did it.\"\n\nRegardless of the motivation for the celebration, head coach Andy Reid was not thrilled with his star receiver. The Chiefs received a 15-yard penalty for his antics.\n\n\"That was too much,'' Reid said. \"I'm all into [players showing their personalities] but he was out of [line]. ... I was not happy.''\n\nStill, Hill didn't seem to regret the flashy display, even in the face of his coach's anger and with league fines looming.\n\n\"The celebration just came into my head and I did it,'' Hill said. \"I've got some good camera skills. I did my thing. I'm just showing love to my teammates. I feel like my teammates deserve it all.''\n\nOne teammate in particular certainly deserved the spotlight. On that play, second-year quarterback and MVP hopeful Patrick Mahomes threw for his 31st touchdown of the season to break a team record set by Len Dawson in 1964. Kansas City still has six games left to play in the regular season.\n\nFor his part, the 83-year-old Hall of Famer was happy to pass the torch on to the young sensation.\n\n\"I didn't even know [the record] was [still] there; I had no idea until the last week or so,\" Dawson told The Kansas City Star's Vahe Gregorian. \"It really wasn't in my thoughts, but hey, it was going to be overcome\u2026 It's just as well it's now: He's a heck of a player.\"", "Co-living, a form of housing where residents rent their own apartments but share common spaces and amenities, was once considered an odd solution to the urban housing crisis. Now it's become so popular, there aren't enough spaces to satisfy demand.\n\nIn November, a startup called Starcity \u2014 which transforms old hotels, retail buildings, and parking garages into co-living spaces \u2014 announced its plan to build the largest co-living complex in the world.\n\nRead more: A startup turning old hotels and offices into housing for San Francisco's forgotten middle-class is expanding to LA\n\nThe company already has buildings in Los Angeles and San Francisco, but the new site will be located in San Jose, which was recently deemed the least affordable place to buy a home in the US. In the next year, the city's housing prices will rise by 15%, according to predictions from the real estate site Zillow.\n\nThat means even more citizens will require homes by 2019.\n\nA Starcity kitchen in San Francisco. Caroline Cakebread/Business Insider\n\nWith nearly 800 bedrooms, the new complex wouldn't solve the city's housing crisis, but it could provide an experiment in \"mega\" co-living spaces.\n\nBy renting out a bedroom, residents gain access to a host of amenities, including home cleaning, dog walking, and laundry services. They'll also share a communal kitchen, living room, and TV area. Some units will have their own bathroom, while others will share with a second room.\n\nAt $800 to $2,500 per unit, the prices are competitive with the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Jose (just over $2,000). Starcity hopes the rooms, which open in 2021, will attract a diverse group of tenants, from single residents to multi-generational families. The building will be located just three blocks from Diridon Station, the city's main transit hub.\n\nOne of Starcity's San Francisco locations, which houses 20 residents. Caroline Cakebread/Business Insider\n\nThe idea, CEO Jon Dishotsky said in a statement, is to create a style of \"vertical living\" that allows co-living spaces to function as their own neighborhood. Unlike traditional apartment buildings, co-living theoretically encourages residents to mingle and collaborate.\n\nTo advance this mission, Starcity is also scheduled to break ground on a 270-unit co-living complex in San Francisco. The building will adhere to SB 35, a California law that requires cities to build more affordable housing. When the complex opens next spring, half of the units will be made affordable to households earning below 80% of the area's median income.\n\nThe San Jose apartments, by contrast, cater to those earning around $88,000 a year.

When it was first drafted, article 13 became famous as some thought it might pose an existential threat to memes.\n\nArticle 13 is part of legislation which was initially blocked in July, but the European Parliament backed the amended legislation in September. It still faces a final vote in early 2019.\n\nIn her article Wojcicki claims that enforcement of Article 13 would bankrupt YouTube's \"creator economy,\" and asks that policymakers re-examine how best to protect copyright.\n\n\"While we support the goals of article 13, the European Parliament's current proposal will create unintended consequences that will have a profound impact on the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people,\" she writes.\n\nShe says that enforcement of the law is unrealistic because it doesn't take into account that sometimes people dispute copyright ownership. She uses the music video for \"Despacito\" \u2014 which has now amassed over 5 billion views since it was uploaded in January 2017 \u2014 as an example.\n\n\"This video contains multiple copyrights, ranging from sound recording to publishing rights. Although YouTube has agreements with multiple entities to license and pay for the video, some of the rights holders remain unknown. That uncertainty means we might have to block videos like this to avoid liability under article 13,\" she says.\n\nA European Parliament source disputed this argument. They told Business Insider:\n\n\"The EP's aim for Article 13 is to give artists a stronger position in invoking their rights for fair compensation when their work is used and distributed online by others. An artist will typically have notified platforms like YouTube that a specific work is theirs. Works for which the rights holder is unknown are therefore unlikely to engage a platform's liability if they are uploaded there.\"\n\nWojcicki also argues that European users would miss out on videos which YouTube would be forced to censor for fear of financial risk.\n\nYou can also read Wojcicki's article in this blog post.", "France's army on Monday appeared to make fun of President Donald Trump for missing a memorial service over the weekend to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I with a picture of soldiers training in the rain and some commentary on motivation.\n\nUsing the English-language hashtag #MondayMotivation in what's normally a straight-laced, French-language Twitter feed, the French army said rain doesn't bother its soldiers.\n\n\"There is rain, but it does not matter.

Sometimes these reports end up as red herrings: Apple has tons of suppliers, including multiple vendors for each part, and it can move around its orders for a variety of reasons.\n\nBut another sign is weighing on Longbow's analysts: Search trends in China show declining sustained consumer interest in new iPhones.\n\n\"Another point of concern is Baidu iPhone searches fell off a cliff for October, indicating potential risk of faltering China demand,\" the analysts wrote, despite slightly increased search traffic for new iPhone models on Baidu in September.\n\nHere are the charts:\n\nLongbow Research\n\nLongbow Research\n\nLast month, Citi performed the same exercise with search results from Google, the dominant search engine in the United States.

MoneyGram's primary competitor, Western Union, saw its overall revenue grow by 2% in Q3 2018 while its digital segment revenue grew by 20% year-over-year. The firms are facing growing threats from the influx of digital-first providers, which are able to undercut them on pricing and offer digital capabilities that consumers want, making their offerings more competitive.\n\nMoneyGram needs to focus on accelerating growth in its digital channels while mitigating losses and preventing further declines in revenue. The firm has been making efforts to boost its digital channels: MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes noted that the firm marked a digital-transformation \"milestone\" by expanding its online service to more countries and launching the MoneyGram app in Europe.\n\nAnd MoneyGram will also need to prioritize its compliance.

Millennials represent a prime target audience for companies to focus on, as they have significant spending power, accounting for $600 billion worth of consumer spending in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nA recent study by Citi Retail Services has identified several shopping trends among millennials that retailers can use to attract them this holiday season:", "Facebook is hungry for video and taking lots of pages from YouTube's playbook when it comes to wooing over creators.\n\nEarlier this fall, Facebook unleashed Watch globally, opening up the company's big bet on premium, long-form video to the world after testing it in the US for a little over a year.\n\nAs part of the rollout, Facebook started allowing anyone \u2014 from users to publishers \u2014 to set up and fund their own Watch shows through a self-serve tool called Creator Studio that is built in to Facebook.\n\nWith Watch's floodgates open and the ability for publishers to bypass Watch's funded team, Facebook is actively encouraging publishers to set up and fund their own Watch programming in exchange for making money from ad breaks, according to sources.\n\nUntil a few months ago, all shows had to be green-lit by Facebook, requiring creators to pitch the social platform their ideas. Facebook's content strategy continues to shift, and the Watch team is experimenting with different formats and production quality, which can make it difficult for creators to know what specific content Facebook is interested in funding.\n\nBut with Creator Studio, they don't have to go through Facebook's funding process.\n\nRead more: 'It is critically important for Facebook to get this right': Publishers say Facebook's rollout of Watch ads is methodical but picking up speed\n\nFacebook Watch on Apple TV. Facebook\n\nCreator Studio helps publishers manage video content and track its performance. The tool also details how many repeat viewers a show has and breaks down the number of one-minute views that are eligible for ad revenue through mid-roll and pre-roll videos. To run ad breaks, Watch Pages must have 10,000 followers and at least 30,000 one-minute views on videos that are three minutes or longer over 60 days.\n\nThe self-serve tool is squarely aimed at YouTube's crop of creators, and it has changed the message that Facebook is sending some publishers about Watch, at least when it comes to entertainment-geared shows that are separate from news shows.\n\nInstead of pitching exclusive, high-quality shows, some publishers have changed their strategy and are cranking out a ton of videos that meet Facebook's qualifications for ad breaks, according to several sources.\n\n\"I think that's only going to continue and grow \u2014 it's almost low-hanging fruit,\" one executive said about Watch's ambitions to attract influencers and creators from YouTube.\n\nPublishers are chasing Watch ad revenue\n\nFacebook has started wrangling up publishers at events to talk about Watch, too.\n\nLast month, Facebook gathered publishers in New York at a partner event to talk about video with execs like Luis Olivalves, who recently changed roles from heading up media partnerships for Latin America to a similar role in North America as part of Sibyl Goldman's team.\n\nThe event gave attendees a crash course in Creator Studio, according to one source.\n\nA Facebook representative said that the company routinely hosted events for publishers of all sizes. The New York event included entertainment, sports, and news publishers.\n\nUntil recently, the opportunity with Watch was slim for publishers that didn't have deep pockets or big concepts that could get directly funded by Facebook. Now, some are trying to rack up as many shows as possible with the goal of making money from advertising.\n\n\"It's totally open \u2014 you can just launch a new Watch Page yourself,\" another publishing source said. \"It's like 'launch as many shows as possible' and if you're successful, you're going to get ad break revenue.\"\n\nWatch is looking more like YouTube but still has a ways to go\n\nThere are a lot of professionally created shows in Watch from companies like BuzzFeed and MTV. There are also a lot of less polished videos that are posted to the News Feed and end up getting pulled into the video tab.\n\nIndeed, Watch looks more similar to YouTube than to Netflix or Hulu.\n\nFacebook\n\nBoth Facebook and its partners are quick to point to Watch as a long-term bet for the company that won't happen overnight.\n\nBut Watch is also increasingly becoming viewed as more than an experiment by Facebook's top execs: Watch was mentioned 12 times during Facebook's third-quarter earnings last week, up from six mentions in first-quarter earnings, according to transcripts of the calls.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg also publicly acknowledged the Google-owned YouTube as a competitor to Watch during the call.\n\n\"We're seeing video grow dramatically across the ecosystem,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And while Watch is now growing very quickly, we're well behind YouTube and still working to make this a unique people-centric experience.\"\n\nSamantha Lee / Business Insider\n\nYouTube influencers are scrambling to get on Watch\n\nMade in Network is one of a handful of so-called multi-channel networks that work with creators to set up and manage web video talent, primarily on YouTube.\n\nOver the past few months, the company's creators have started building out Watch shows, some of which make nearly as much money from ad revenue as its YouTube shows.\n\n\"In the past couple of months, as they've introduced ad breaks and tools, we've seen a lot more meaningful revenue generation for our clients,\" said Keith Johnson, the chief operating officer at Made in Network.\n\nJohnson declined to name specific creators but said one YouTube channel had doubled its revenue by adding a Watch show. Revenue from the Watch show is 10% smaller than YouTube's after running for a few months.\n\nThe company's influencers have experimented with both original Watch shows and repurposing YouTube content for Facebook, with repurposed content working better so far.\n\n\"We actually end up seeing pretty distinct audiences, so it doesn't feel like we're splitting people between the two,\" Johnson said. \"Even though it's the same content, we have a new pipeline to get to them through Facebook.\"\n\nFacebook is changing the shows it funds, too\n\nFacebook continues to green-light programs for Watch, but the funding has increasingly shifted to fewer big, celebrity-driven programs that appeal to broad audiences.\n\nSome of the high-profile shows range from interactive talk-show formats like Jada Pinkett Smith's \"Red Table Talk\" (which has 3.8 million followers) to dramas like \"Sorry for Your Loss\" (which has 107,000 followers).\n\nFacebook is also funding shows with various formats, like a scripted program called \"Skam: Austin\" that has run for two seasons on Watch.\n\nOne source suggested that Facebook was considering outsourcing parts of the development process of its funded Watch shows to firms.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman said the company was experimenting with different funding models for partners, which include digital publishers, creators, and traditional media companies.\n\nGranular data is still a challenge with Watch\n\nWhile Facebook's video ad revenue is starting to kick in for creators, data and measurement is still a challenge.\n\n\"They make it really hard to dig in to the data and attribute it to different things and to figure out what's actually driving it,\" Johnson said. \"There's a lot that's murky and behind a veil.\"\n\nSeveral sources said it was unclear how views broke down between the News Feed and the Watch tab. One source estimated that most views were still coming from news feeds, where videos are exposed to huge audiences.\n\n\"It's really hard to know the split between Watch and feed because they don't tell you \u2014 you don't have any data or insights,\" the source said. \"They will never tell you if a Facebook video view comes from the Watch tab or the feed \u2014 I'm still pretty sure that a lot of the views come from the feed.\"\n\nDo you know something interesting about Watch?

But it also shows the growing dominance of Democrats in the major cities. Even in Texas, Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher won the 7th congressional district in Houston, becoming the first Democrat to hold the seat since George H.W. Bush turned the seat in favor of Republicans in 1967..\n\nSimilarly, in the urban-suburban districts, Democrats are nearing a clean sweep: Five Democrats took over formerly GOP-held urban-suburban districts in Pennsylvania, Texas, California, and Florida (two seats).\n\nThe only two GOP urban-suburban districts are California's 45th in Orange County, held by a Republican since its inception in 1983, and Florida's 25th in the suburbs of Miami, also held by Republicans since its inception in 2003.\n\nSkye Gould/Business Insider\n\nSuburban battleground\n\nThe most heated battleground in the House came in the fight over the suburbs, where it appears Democrats are squeezing the GOP out of these seats.\n\nParticularly in dense suburban districts, Democrats are gaining a definite edge. In just eight years, the party has gone from controlling a slim majority of these districts \u2014 just 53% \u2014 to a dominant 80%.\n\nSimilarly, Republicans and Democrats flipped places when it came to sparse suburban districts. Democrats held 34 such seats after 2010, while the GOP held 52. Now those numbers are perfectly flipped.\n\nThe suburban districts were also the biggest source of Democratic pick-ups on Tuesday, with 26 seats in suburban districts flipping. Only one seat flipped to Republicans: the newly redrawn Pennsylvania 1st.\n\nDemocrats' success in the suburbs was personified by them turning blue dense suburban districts in deep-red states:\n\nFor instance, Democrat Kendra Horn became the first non-GOP winner since 1975 in Oklahoma's 5th district in the suburbs around Oklahoma City.\n\nAnd Georgia's 6th district in the suburbs of Atlanta, once home of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, is on the verge of electing a Democrat for the first time since 1979.\n\nWhile these wins may be partly attributable to the fact that a president's party typically loses seats in their first midterm, these areas have long been GOP strongholds in solid GOP states. They were held by Republicans through previous Democratic waves.\n\nThere are several demographic explanations for the shift \u2014 older millennials moving out to the suburbs or the long-term shrinking of America's white majority\u2014 but there are also some uniquely political issues as well.\n\nPresident Donald Trump does not poll as well with college-educated people or women compared to previous Republican presidents, and those two groups are significant parts of the suburban electorate.\n\nSkye Gould/Business Insider\n\nRed rural districts\n\nJust as Democrats are nearing a monopoly in the urban districts, so too are Republicans solidifying their stranglehold on rural areas.

If they reject it, Britain would face leaving the EU without an agreement. Sterling, which has fallen to $1.28 from $1.50 on the day of the referendum, would sink while bond yields on UK debt would likely fall.\n\nFor details on how the vote might work:\n\nMay's compromise plan, which seeks to maintain close trade ties with the EU in the future, is facing opposition from Brexiteers, pro-Europeans, the Northern Irish party that props up her government, and even some of her own ministers.\n\nWith no deal and thus no transition period, the UK would move - on March 29 at 11 pm London time - from seamless trade with the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states.\n\nBusiness chiefs and investors say a \"no-deal\" Brexit would weaken the West, panic financial markets and block the arteries of trade. Brexit supporters say such fears are exaggerated and Britain would thrive in the long term.\n\nU.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan said on Nov. 9 it expects parliament to reject the deal at first and then, after a period of volatility, to give its approval on a second or even third go in early January.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party has indicated it will vote against the deal and that if the government loses then it will demand a national election.\n\n- MAY FALLS\n\nIt is unclear whether May would hold on to power after losing a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal.\n\nMay's snap election in 2017 lost her Conservative Party its parliamentary majority and the government is now propped up by 10 Democratic Unionist Party lawmakers from Northern Ireland.\n\nHer party, which has been split over Europe for 30 years, is in open conflict and some of her lawmakers want a new leader. It is unclear who might replace her.\n\nIf May fell, selection of a new party leader could delay already tight Brexit negotiations. A national election is possible, though not legally necessary. Opinion polls show no party has a clear enough lead to be sure of victory.\n\n2) LAST-MINUTE DEAL\n\nEU diplomats say a deal is almost done, though they are haggling over intricacies of a backup plan for the land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\n\"Technically speaking, the text is ready. But there is no political agreement from their side,\" a senior EU diplomat said.\n\nEU sources said they want clarity from London by the end of Wednesday at the latest if there is to be a summit this month to approve a Brexit deal.\n\nIf there is no summit to approve Brexit this month, then the EU has a scheduled council meeting planned for Dec. 13-14, though an emergency summit could be also be called. The British parliament goes on holiday on Dec. 20.\n\n\"Our base case is firmly for a deal,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients on Nov. 9. \"We assess the probability of a deal to trigger the status quo transition period as at least 70 percent.\"\n\n3) BREXIT REVERSED\n\nIf the UK slides into chaos, there is a chance Brexit could be stopped through a popular vote, though May has repeatedly ruled out another Brexit referendum.\n\nThree of the four former British prime ministers still alive - John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - have said a referendum is the way to resolve the crisis.\n\nPolls show Britons remain divided, though a recent survey by Survation showed the United Kingdom would now vote to stay in the EU as more young people and those who did not bother to vote in the referendum would now vote against Brexit.\n\nJo Johnson, the younger brother of leading Brexiteer and former foreign minister Boris, resigned from May's government last Friday, calling in a withering critique for another referendum to prevent her Brexit plans.\n\nThe main hope of campaigners for another referendum is that May's deal is voted down but Labour's wish for an election is thwarted. Parliament, according to this scenario, would vote for a second referendum and the Article 50 process would be extended to allow a referendum to take place.\n\nBrexit supporters say a second referendum would trigger a major constitutional crisis, and possibly even public disorder.\n\n(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \"Fintech Briefing\" subscribers.

But one of their suppliers is taking a different approach.\n\nPanasonic, which makes infotainment systems for cars and batteries for electric vehicles, among a wide range of other products, isn't trying to reinvent itself, Tom Gebhardt, the company's North America CEO, told Business Insider. Instead, Panasonic is modifying its products for new uses.\n\n\"I think it's always easier to leverage off what you know and what you have history with, rather than trying to recreate the world,\" Gebhardt said.\n\nGebhardt characterized Panasonic's transition as a shift from selling products primarily to consumers to selling directly to businesses. That means applying technologies it has developed for consumer products, like televisions and batteries (though Panasonic first made automotive batteries in the 1930s), to new vehicles made by its customers.\n\nDoing so could lessen the need for the kinds of major research-and-development investments in unfamiliar technologies that some automakers see as necessary to remain competitive in the long term.\n\n\"We're really comfortable in your TV room today,\" Gebhardt said. \"And we move a lot of those similar technologies into vehicle transportation.\"\n\nTesla has been a 'great customer,' despite hurting profits\n\nThat doesn't mean there won't be bumps in the road. Panasonic said in October that its battery business failed to make a profit for two consecutive quarters in part because of costs required by Tesla, its largest battery customer. Since 2017, Tesla has been ramping up the production of its Model 3 sedan, which features Panasonic battery cells.\n\nPanasonic said that during the third quarter, it had to increase its rate of battery production at Tesla's Sparks, Nevada, factory faster than expected, which meant it had to hire more employees and increase short-term spending.\n\n\"We are investing in a lot of people so we can catch up with the pace of production,\" Hirokazu Umeda, Panasonic's CFO, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRead more: Car companies are pouring billions into self-driving tech they may never use, experts say\n\nGebhardt spoke with Business Insider before Panasonic announced its third-quarter earnings and called Tesla a \"great customer,\" highlighting the automaker's innovative and popular vehicles. (The Model 3 outsold competing vehicles made by Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz during the third quarter.)\n\n\"It's always just great to be a partner with somebody that's leading and pushing a market,\" Gebhardt said. \"It's always good to be in that position because you're on the cusp of doing things that haven't been done before.\"\n\nGebhardt: Solid-state batteries at least a decade away for the average electric vehicle\n\nWhile big changes are ahead for the auto industry, Gebhardt said he didn't anticipate \"huge, disruptive\" changes coming to infotainment systems in the next five to 10 years. Instead, he said he expected incremental changes, such as more powerful processors, better user interfaces, and larger screens with better resolution.\n\nThe same applies to batteries. The battery industry, as with the tech industry, likes to build anticipation for the next major technological breakthrough, even if it won't be ready in the near future, Gebhardt said. Gebhardt and other battery experts have touted solid-state technology as the next significant development in the battery industry. Solid-state batteries replace the liquid electrolyte used in today's lithium-ion batteries with a solid material that could make batteries less flammable while increasing their capacity and charging speed.\n\nBut Gebhardt said he didn't see solid-state batteries reaching mass adoption in the auto industry during the next decade. He predicted rather that lithium-ion batteries would achieve marginal improvements in capacity, charging speed, and safety.\n\n\"We're still pretty bullish on lithium ion but clearly understand that solid state is something that we all want to get to at some point in the future,\" Gebhardt said.", "Russian President Vladimir Putin said France specifically asked him not to hold one-on-one meetings with US President Donald Trump during World War I commemorations in Paris this past weekend \u2014 but he ended up chatting with him anyway.\n\nPutin on Sunday afternoon said he agreed to France's request so as to \"not violate\" France's planned events. \"We will agree that we will not violate the schedule of the host party here: At their request, we will not organize any meetings here,\" he told the Russian state-owned RT news channel, according to the state-run Interfax news agency.\n\nLess than an hour later, however, Putin told reporters that he did end up having a brief conversation with Trump.\n\nWhen asked by journalists whether he had a chance to talk to Trump, Putin said \"yes,\" Interfax and RT reported.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian President Justin Trudeau, and the European Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, also attended the commemoration.\n\nIt was the first time the two leaders met since their summit in Helsinki in July, during which Trump claimed that he didn't \"see any reason\" why Russia would have interfered in the 2016 US elections. National security experts have said Trump behaved like a \"controlled spy.\"\n\nAccording to the Russian newspaper Kommersant, the request that Putin and Trump not meet one-on-one came from French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe French president asked that his Russian and US counterparts not hold negotiations in Paris that could \"eclipse\" the events and meetings that Paris had organized, Kommersant said, citing a European diplomatic source.\n\nWorld leaders at a World War I commemoration at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Sunday.

Before they came in, I asked them to track their time for one day.\n\nWhen I asked what they'd found, their heads started shaking.\n\n\"I spend 80% of my time on things that don't matter,\" one guy said.\n\nAnother: \"I spend hours in email every day. For what? I just do it again the next day.\"\n\nThen I asked what they wanted to spend time on. One entrepreneur said, \"I want to spend time on things that actually make me money.\"\n\nYour turn. Let me ask you these two questions:\n\nOn an average day, where do you spend your time? If you could spend your time any way you wanted, where would you spend your time?\n\nTake a look at what you spent your time on yesterday. What would you say?\n\nBe honest: If you watched three hours of Netflix (the average American watches five hours of TV every day), that's OK!\n\nYes, that sickening feeling in your stomach means the answers to those two questions don't add up. You know it. I know it. We all know it.\n\nNow ask: Where do you WANT your time to go?\n\nRelated: I'm convinced a mistaken belief that keeps people from building wealth can be dismantled with 5 minutes of simple math\n\nIf we could wave a magic wand and spend our time where we wanted to, most of us would not choose to spend three hours per day in email. We'd spend it on our relationships with friends and family, exploring the city we live in or traveling, working on higher-value items or just having fun.\n\nBut... how can you do it?\n\nWell, first forget about \"productivity hacks.\" You know the kind I'm talking about: to-do apps (and journals), RescueTime, or \"minimalism\" (where you ONLY own three pairs of grey pants, two blue shirts, and a 4,000-dollar laptop) are the coupon-clipping of the productivity world. Doing these things might feel good and helpful, but they're ultimately useless.\n\nI tried the apps. I tried minimalism. I tried all these tactics. Some of them worked and I incorporated them into my productivity system. But I needed to save more than just a few minutes \u2014 I needed to free up 2+ hours a day.\n\nAnd we all know that working harder isn't the solution. Longer hours, another shot of espresso, catching up on the weekend, an unhappy spouse, stress, and a sudden moment of realization in your late 40s that something is wrong. #HustleLife\n\nI knew that I was starting to get swamped with emails and pulled in all kinds of directions. I knew this would only get worse \u2014 and I had to figure out a solution now, because the more successful I became, the harder it would be to figure it out. So I went all in.\n\nI went a different route ... and realized that I needed help.\n\nThe most successful people have something in common: People who can help them \u2014 a personal trainer, a business coach, a supportive spouse.\n\nI realized I had money but not time \u2014 and that, with this money, I could \"buy back\" my time.\n\nThat's when I hired an assistant.\n\nI know, I thought it was crazy, too. Until I tried it.\n\nIt's funny, because I didn't look like the kind of person who would have an assistant. I was in my early 20s. I didn't work at a fancy office or wear a fancy suit.\n\nBut I was busy and I was ambitious. I worked at a startup during the day and wrote my now best-selling book on personal finance at night. I didn't want to spend my time on mundane tasks. And I didn't care if it was weird for a guy in his early 20s to have an assistant. I wanted my time back.\n\nSo I hired a part-time assistant on Craigslist. Since then \u2014 over 10 years ago \u2014 I've built an incredible system with my assistant, who helps me remove the following off my plate. My assistant:\n\nSchedules appointments (one-off and recurring)\n\nHandles thank you cards\n\nSelects, buys, and ships items\n\nOrganizes follow-ups for networking contacts\n\nPreps documents\n\nCoordinates speaking engagements\n\nScreens calls (calls customer service or waits on hold)\n\nSends out media releases\n\nMaintains contact details\n\nReturns merchandise and checks on refunds\n\nBuys event tickets\n\nProvides customer support\n\nResearches weekend activities\n\nResearches questions\n\nOrganizes to-dos\n\nSends reminders\n\nChecks in for flights\n\nTracks birthdays and sends gifts\n\nPlans vacations\n\nOrders and delivers food\n\nMakes dinner reservations\n\nProcesses emails\n\nWith just this list, she helps me save over 20 hours per week!\n\nThat's time that I can invest directly into the things that I actually want to be doing for weeks, months, and years \u2014not to shave off a few minutes here and there.\n\nRamit Sethi is the author of the New York Times bestseller, \"I Will Teach You To Be Rich,\" and writes for more than 1 million readers on his websites, iwillteachyoutoberich.com and GrowthLab.com.

As part of a restructuring effort this year, it has cut jobs and hired former General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt as chairman.\n\nThe acquisition values Athenahealth at $135 per share, according to a statement on Monday.

Cabinet, set to meet on Tuesday will not have an agreement to ratify, just as they didn't have one last week, or the week before that.\n\nAnd this means that unless something dramatic changes in the next two days then Britain is hurtling rapidly towards the Brexit danger-zone.\n\nThat means three things:\n\nThe promised November EU summit to finalise a Brexit withdrawal deal will almost certainly now not happen and the deal will get pushed back until December. This is just three months away from Brexit, which means a no-deal scenario \u2014 for a long time ruled out as a near impossibility in Westminster \u2014 will rapidly become the baseline scenario. It also means emergency plans to route shipping through alternative ports as Dover grinds to a halt, will have to commence (reportedly from Thursday) meaning everything from the manufacturing sector to aviation, to finance becoming increasingly gripped by Brexit panic.\n\nEven if a deal can be broken in the coming week, the difficulties of getting that deal through parliament, after the resignation of yet another Conservative minister on Friday, look greater than ever.\n\nPut simply, the route for May to get a deal that can pass through her cabinet and parliament looks narrower than ever before and that means the smart money should increasingly be placed on a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThere is an assumption in politics that everything will ultimately be alright in the end. The public, particularly in a peaceful and prosperous country such as the United Kingdom, assumes that politicians will knuckle down and do what has to be done to prevent economic or political catastrophe.\n\nBut as plenty of other nations around the world have discovered over the years, sometimes bad things happen to good countries. Sometimes the clock runs out. Sometimes solutions cannot be found.\n\nThere is still time for May to solve the Brexit conundrum.

He described the situation as \"ridiculously unfair.\"\n\nThe US by far spends the most in NATO, both on its own defense budget and on programs to increase the readiness and capabilities of its European allies.\n\nIn 2014, NATO countries agreed to raise their defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product by 2024. So far, only five countries \u2014 mainly in eastern and central Europe where the threat of Russia looms large \u2014 have met that pledge.\n\nSince his campaign days, Trump has demanded NATO countries meet that 2% figure, or even double it, immediately.\n\nGermany, Europe's biggest economy, has expressed little interest in hitting that benchmark.\n\nThe metric of percentage of GDP spent on the military can also be deceptive. Defense spending has broad and differing definitions around the globe.\n\nGreece is one of the few NATO countries that meet the 2% spending mark, but it spends much of that on pensions.\n\nNATO's newest member, Montenegro, could spend 2% of its GDP on defense, which would be only $95 million, just over the cost of one US Air Force F-35.\n\nNATO pullout?\n\nTrump gave a speech to NATO members in Poland in July 2017 standing in front of a statue made of metal from the World Trade Center.

What a f------ idiot,\" Verstappen could be heard shouting on his team radio.\n\nIn Formula One, it is customary not to interfere with the race leader if you're being lapped. However, you are allowed to unlap yourself.\n\nUnlapping is extremely rare against the race leader, though, and Verstappen was clearly not expecting to find Ocon between his car and the apex when the two collided.\n\nOcon was handed a 10-second stop/start penalty for causing the collision, but the damage incurred on Verstappen's Red Bull meant he was unable to catch up with Hamilton's Mercedes, which cruised to victory.\n\nThe drama didn't stop there, though. At the post-race weigh-in, an incensed Verstappen confronted Ocon and started pushing him.\n\nYou can watch the crash and following altercation below.\n\nCommenting on the fracas, Verstappen said: \"We are passionate about the sport, it would be odd if I shook his hand,\" adding: \"I don't really have a lot to comment on that, except that he was being a p----.\"\n\nThe two drivers were later summoned to the stewards' office and the Dutchman was handed two days public service at the direction of the FIA.\n\n\"The Stewards understood from Max Verstappen that he was extremely upset by the incident on track during the race and accepted his explanation that it was not his original intent to strike Ocon, but that he was 'triggered' and caused him to lose his temper,\" read the official stewards verdict.\n\n\"While sympathetic to Verstappen's passion, the Stewards determined that it is the obligation of sportsmen at this level to act appropriately and as role models to other drivers at all levels and found that Verstappen failed in this respect.\"\n\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner backed his driver, though: \"As a lapped car you should not interfere with the leader,\" he said. \"What was Ocon thinking of there? It beggars belief. It makes no sense at all.\"\n\nHorner even backed Verstappen's post-race actions and said Ocon got off lightly: \"Esteban was lucky to get away with a push, to be honest.

Uber issued a $2 billion junk-bond deal last month, despite rapid cash burn and growing competition. And while Tesla's precarious debt situation is nothing new, it's in a similar boat as the others. Tesla is giving some investors jitters because it has $1.6 billion of maturities looming over the next 12 months.\n\nInvestors are favoring companies' potential over their underlying financial health, in part because they're benefitting from the \"halo effect\" of their sexy, big-name brands, says Christian Hoffmann, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.\n\nIt's a marked shift in the industry. Demand is growing, for now. But it's a risky scenario.\n\nUnicorns don't belong\n\n\"In general, unicorns don't belong in high yield,\" said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill, a US investment firm that manages fixed-income funds. \"Putting financial leverage on companies with high levels of operating leverage, minimal tangible assets, and/or the ability to generate cash flow is irresponsible.\"\n\nLeverage refers to the amount of debt a company has amassed over its earnings. Having high leverage means a company has more debt than assets available to pay off debts at a given time.\n\nOn the whole, investors tend to steer clear of companies that are highly leveraged or have far-from-robust credit metrics, Hoffmann says.\n\nTake WeWork: The company received $4.4 billion in investment from a major SoftBank fund last year but runs an \"asset light\" model because it leases most of its office space. Despite plenty of hype, the company posts loss after loss and, according to Moody's, is unlikely to turn a profit anytime soon.\n\nIn August, Moody's took the unusual step of withdrawing a B3 rating on the New York-based company, citing a lack of information. For bond holders, the company's limited assets make it a riskier proposition in repayment terms if things go south.\n\nChasing yield is getting tougher\n\nTesla's high leverage and cash-burning activities have given some investors cause for concern because the company will eventually need some way of paying it off. The company took its first foray into the junk-bond market in August 2017 with a $1.8 billion issue.\n\nWeWork declined to comment for this story. Uber and Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nBond investors chasing yield haven't had a lot of choice lately. But they have found a home in this part of the market. With high return comes more risk, though. A set of poor earnings could lead to declining confidence from lenders and greater scrutiny of the market. Throw in a US recession, and things could get very, very bad.\n\nThese companies and other unicorns tend to be \"highly reliant on capital markets and have very pressing debt issues,\" McClain said.\n\nAnd then there's Uber. Its $2 billion bond deal last month was compared to deals by WeWork and Tesla because of the company's rapid cash burn as competition heats up with its rival ride hailer Lyft. Uber lost an eye-watering $4.5 billion in 2017. The company was able to issue its bonds via a private placement, allowing it to bypass the Securities and Exchange Commission's reporting requirements.\n\nSo-called leveraged loans have garnered a lot of negative attention lately, with former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and the Bank of England among those sounding the alarm on their potential risk. But the $1.6 trillion market is hot nonetheless: Responding to strong demand, Uber also raised a $1.5 billion leveraged loan directly from investors in March, a higher amount than the company had originally planned.\n\nLeveraged loans differ from high-yield bonds in that they are secured, meaning creditors are paid before bondholders. Volumes have spiked in recent years with covenants protecting lenders from defaults deteriorating over this period, making the loans more akin to bonds.\n\nMcClain said the high-yield market had been lucrative to tech stocks because financing has tended to be cheaper and more effective than selling more stock.\n\nThe message is clear: If you're a big-name tech company with even bigger ambitions, investors are lining up to lend to you.", "A US Navy F-18 fighter jet crashed into the Philippine Sea early on Monday morning in the second aircraft mishap aboard the USS Ronald Reagan within a month.\n\nThe F-18, part of Carrier Air Wing 5 onboard the USS Ronald Reagan, experienced a \"mechanical issue that resulted in the crew ejecting\" while carrying out \"routine operations\" from the Nimitz-class supercarrier, the US Navy 7th Fleet said.\n\nBoth pilots managed to eject before the plane impacted the sea off the coast of the Philippines, and rescue aircraft based off the USS Ronald Reagan swiftly picked them up, they said.\n\nAn F/A-18E Super Hornet from the Tophatters of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 14 participates in an air power demonstration over the aircraft carrier USS John C.

Zambada also agreed not to contest the government's seizure of $1.3 billion in ill-gotten assets in a related case brought in Chicago in 2009.\n\nJury selection for Guzman's trial in New York wrapped up this week, with opening statements set for Tuesday.\n\nZambada would know details about the inner workings of Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel few others would know. Zambada oversaw cartel logistics until his 2009 arrest and had authority to order hits; by his early 20s, Zambada, the son of another Sinaloa kingpin, Ismael Zambada, was already handling illegal shipments of drugs bound for Chicago, Los Angeles and other US cities, filings say.\n\nIn an indication of how valuable his testimony could be and how dangerous taking the witness stand would be for him and his family, prosecutors said in the plea deal that they'll recommend the US government provide security to him and his family. That could include permitting them to stay permanently in the United States, the agreement says.\n\nMexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is escorted by soldiers in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, as he is extradited to New York, January 19, 2017.

The hearing wasn't listed on court schedules, though a Chicago Tribune reporter attended and described Zambada as appearing relaxed as he answered a judge's questions through an interpreter.\n\nHis agreement doesn't say explicitly he will testify in New York. But it does say he agrees to cooperate in providing testimony \"in any matter\" and \"in any investigation.\" He faces anywhere from 10 years to life in prison, but prosecutors would recommend a sentence at the low range of guidelines if Zambada cooperates as promised.\n\nThe judge set a Feb. 27 sentencing date, though that would likely be delayed as Zambada continues to aid prosecutors.\n\nThe US attorney's office in Chicago declined any comment.\n\nZambada pleaded guilty under a similar arrangement in the Chicago case in 2013, in what was the first indication he'd turned on his former Sinaloa cohorts.\n\nThe Chicago indictment, which names Guzman as a co-defendant, says the cartel used speed boats and submarines to transport drugs. The cartel sent 747-cargo planes full of clothes on supposed humanitarian missions to South America, returning with 13 tons of cocaine.\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Tarm on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mtarm", "Florida's midterm elections descended into chaos over the weekend as three recounts were ordered and baseless claims of voter fraud arose.\n\nTensions reached a fever pitch after Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner ordered automatic machine recounts for the US Senate, governor, and agricultural commissioner races in an unprecedented move.\n\nAmid continuous baseless claims of voter fraud from President Donald Trump and Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott, election officials strained under tight deadlines.\n\nThree close races\n\nU.S. Sen.

In every warring country, they gave their lives.\n\nAP\n\nMany of their jobs involved danger and caused death. In Britain, women worked in factories, including in the production of weapons \u2014 a key role, given that the side that could produce the most weapons in the war of attrition would ultimately win.\n\nBy 1917, munitions sites, which mostly employed women workers, produced 80 percent of the weapons and shells used by the British Army, according to historian A. V. M. Airth-Kindree.\n\nShe said some female workers in Britain were known as \"canaries\" because they had to handle TNT, which caused their skin to turn yellow.\n\nAround 400 women in Britain died from overexposure to TNT during WWI, according to estimates.\n\nAmong the Allies, organizations such as the Red Cross depended on thousands of female volunteers.\n\nBy June 1918, there were over 3,000 American nurses in over 750 in hospitals in France, as many more served in the Nurse Corps in the US army and naval.\n\nAs nurses, it was common for them to be sent to the front line and witness its horror first hand. One solemn reminder of that lies in the headstones of the Cromwell twins at the Suresnes American Cemetery that US President Donald Trump visited Sunday.\n\nLibrary of Congress\n\nThe two were beloved American nurses who worked tirelessly for the Red Cross in France. They survived the war only to commit suicide in 1919, it's believed, due to the trauma.\n\nWhile most countries banned women from fighting, Russia was the sole country to allow them in combat, from 1917.\n\nOne female combatant, Maria Bochkareva, founded Russia's \"Women's Battalion of Death,\" recovered from injuries and became a decorated commander.\n\nDespite the inequities, the war period was a key moment in the women's movement as it marked the first time on a wide scale that women realized their roles could be beyond domestic.\n\nDuring Sunday's ceremony, a letter written by Denise Bruller to her soldier fianc\u00e9 Pierre Fort was read out, speaking of her emotion and anguish at the end of the war that caused \"upheaval to the very depths of my being.\"\n\nLove and emotion were very much part of the war \u2014 and its propaganda \u2014 and such stories help color the narrative of loss.

He has said, without evidence, that there was \"no collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia. And audio recently resurfaced of Whitaker falsely accusing \"the left\" of sowing \"this theory that essentially Russians interfered with the US election,\" a theory he claimed had been disproved and did not affect the election.\n\nWhile he was Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker met with Trump in the Oval Office more than a dozen times, The Washington Post reported, adding that whenever Trump complained about the Russia investigation, Whitaker \"often smiled knowingly and nodded in assent.\"", "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has shown the missiles in its advanced J-20 stealth fighter jet to the public for the first time at its largest airshow, the Global Times newspaper reported on Monday.\n\nThe newspaper said two J-20 fighter jets opened their missile bay doors during a flypast on Monday, revealing that each jet had four missiles in its fuselage and one on either side of the aircraft.\n\nCiting Chinese experts, the newspaper said the demonstration, which came on the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Air Force, displayed the J-20's superiority to the top U.S. fighter jets, the F-22 and F-35, as well as the PLA's growing confidence.\n\nIt also quoted military expert Song Zhongping as saying the four missiles in the J-20's fuselage were long-range air-to-air missiles, while the two on the sides were short-range combat missiles meant for aerial combat.\n\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Paul Tait)", "Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, whose lead has narrowed in the state's US Senate race, filed more lawsuits against local election officials on Sunday, asking a judge to order police to impound voting machines and ballots when they are not in use.\n\nOn Saturday, a machine recount began in the race between Scott and incumbent Democratic US Senator Bill Nelson in one of the most closely watched swing-state contests in last Tuesday's congressional elections.\n\nBy the time the recount was ordered, Scott's lead had shrunk to 12,500 votes, or 0.15%, below the threshold under which a machine recount is automatically triggered under state law. Each side has accused the other of trying to subvert democracy in an echo of the drama in the 2000 presidential vote recount that unfolded for weeks in Florida.\n\nAnother recount was also triggered in the gubernatorial race between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum as DeSantis' lead shrank to 33,700 votes, or 0.41 percent, as of Saturday.\n\nSusan Bucher, the Palm Beach County elections supervisor, told CNN on Sunday that it would be \"impossible\" for the county to meet the Thursday deadline set for the race recounts.\n\nScott's lawsuit on Sunday targeted the election supervisors in Democratic-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\nIt asked a judge to issue an emergency injunction for the county sheriffs and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to seize all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots when they are not being used until the end the end of the recount and any related litigation is over.\n\nScott filed a separate lawsuit late on Saturday against Broward County officials, asking the judge to order that any ballots counted after noon on Saturday be disregarded, saying that to include them would break state law.\n\n\"The Broward and Palm Beach County Supervisors of Elections has already demonstrated a blatant disregard for Florida's elections laws, making it more important than ever that we continue to do everything possible to prevent fraud and ensure this recount is operated responsibly,\" Chris Hartline, a spokesman for Scott's campaign, said in a statement.\n\nNelson said Scott was panicking in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"If Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended,\" Nelson said in the statement. \"He's doing this for the same reason he's been making false and panicked claims about voter fraud - he's worried that when all the votes are counted he'll lose this election.\"\n\nNelson has also filed a federal lawsuit asking that provisional and absentee ballots not be rejected because election officials deem that the signatures do not match voters' signatures on file.", "SAP announced on Sunday that it plans to acquire IPO-bound startup Qualtrics for $8 billion cash.\n\nQualtrics was on the verge of its IPO \u2014 it was even on its roadshow with potential investors this past week. It had expected to raise about $495 million in its IPO and at the midpoint of its $18-to-$21 price range, it would have been valued at $4.8 billion.\n\nAnd the roadshow was going well, said Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith in a press conference with SAP CEO Bill McDermott on Sunday. All signs pointed to a very successful first day of trading and beyond, because Qualtrics had been cash-flow positive for most of its history even amid its rapid growth, and it was reporting a net profit, said Smith. It had earned $289.9 million in revenue in 2017, up 52% from its $190 million in revenue in 2016 and reported a net income of $2.5 million, up from $12 million in losses in 2016.\n\nQualtrics founder CEO Ryan Smith Qualtrics \"Our IPO was going extremely well,\" Smith said on the call. \"We were the only show on the road last week and it was going as well as any IPO of ... a cash positive high-growth company.\"\n\n\"We chose to be here,\" Smith said of the acquisition.\n\nSAP Bill McDermott doubled down on the idea, saying, \"Ryan is being modest. I happen to know this was going to be the most successful IPO of 2018. He's oversubscribed.\"\n\nAll of that helps to explain why SAP is paying quite a premium for Qualtrics, which was valued at $2.5 billion at the time of its last private fundraising.\n\nThe two said on the phone that SAP had been in talks with Qualtrics for \"a few months,\" with Smith claiming that McDermott \"really chased it down.\"\n\nWith Qualtrics, McDermott is buying growth in the oh-so-important cloud software market. SAP is best known for its financial software, known to the industry as enterprise resource planning (ERP). It is the world's largest supplier of ERP software, competing with the likes of Oracle.\n\nBut SAP is also going head-to-head with just about every other big cloud software player as well, including market and sales software. Qualtrics complements SAP's flagship offerings, the same way that LinkedIn complements Microsoft's customer relationship management (CRM) strategy.\n\nQualtrics is itself the leader in online market research software. And it has been repositioning itself into a new market that Smith has dubbed \"experience management.\" By that, he means helping companies get a complete world of their perception and performance, as seen by customers, employees, partners, and anyone else whose opinion matters for your business.\n\nMcDermott says of the Qualtrics deal that \"this is the No. 1 most transformative thing I've ever been involved in.\"\n\nHe explained the premium price tag in a more practical matter, too. \"This is less of a multiple than others in the industry have done, but it's the largest as far as the growth that we could realize from it. We'd have to do a whole lot of tuck-ins to do what we have one in one move here.\"\n\nHe is, perhaps, referring to the surprise huge acquisition in the enterprise software world of IBM's blockbuster planned purchase of Red Hat for $34 billion.

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\n\nQualtrics specializes in what it calls experience management, or XM, providing tools to help companies gather feedback and optimize their products.\n\nAfter the deal closes, Qualtrics will maintain its headquarters in Seattle and Provo, Utah. Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith will continue in his role as well.\n\nQualtrics is something of an anomaly in the world of high-flying tech startups. Founded in 2002 by Smith and his father, a professor of marketing at Brigham Young University, the company didn't accept any venture funding until it had been in business for a decade. Qualtrics raised $400 million in total venture-capital funding from investors including Accel and Sequoia Capital.\n\nOver the years, the younger Smith has earned a reputation for having an eccentric brand of generosity. At one point, Qualtrics paid to sponsor the NBA's Utah Jazz and had the team wear a patch promoting its \"5 for the Fight\" cancer-research campaign. At another point, the company loaned a customer a Tesla Model X.\n\nThe deal comes shortly after IBM announced its intent to purchase Red Hat, an open-source-software provider, for $34 billion.

Critics immediately began to speculate that the move was a form of retaliation against CNN.\n\nTrump has been vocal about his opposition to CNN's coverage, and has also been vocal about his opposition to the merger, which was eventually approved in court but is still facing legal challenges.\n\nIn a May tweet, Trump noted his administration's opposition to the merger. It was seemingly a response to a piece published the same day in which Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said, \"The president denied the merger.\"\n\nThe revelation of the Democrats' planned investigation comes the same week that Trump got in a heated exchange with CNN's Jim Acosta, which resulted in the White House suspending Acosta's press credentials.\n\nOn Friday, Trump defended the action against Acosta and warned, \"It could be others also.\"", "It seems like everyone is already in the holiday spirit as the latest telling of the Dr. Seuss classic, \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" took a nice bite out of the US box office over the weekend.\n\nThe most recent title from animation studio Illumination (creators of \"Despicable Me,\" \"Minions,\" and \"Sing\") has definitely put a smile on Universal's face, which releases the animation studio's works.

That is a significant increase from the $25.3 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) Alibaba shoppers spent in 2017.\n\nAlibaba's Singles Day celebration is the biggest shopping day of the year, as the company dominates the Chinese e-commerce market. Shoppers \u2014 primarily in China, though the company is increasingly offering Singles Day deals in new countries \u2014 flock to Alibaba sites including Taobao.com and Tmall.com.\n\nMore than one billion delivery orders were placed over the course of the 24 hours, the first time Alibaba's Singles Day sales surpassed the billion-package landmark. Last year, 812 million orders were placed on 11/11.\n\nTotal online sales on Black Friday reached $5 billion in 2017, according to Adobe Analytics data. Cyber Monday sales were roughly $6.6 billion.\n\n\"Everywhere I go, which is pretty much everywhere in the world, there are not very many people who do not know about 11/11,\" Alibaba's president, Michael Evans, told Business Insider in an interview on Sunday.\n\n\"Many people ask the question \u2014 how can we participate next year? People are very interested, I think partly because they've heard of Black Friday and Cyber Monday and they think that's quite big.\"\n\nHe continued: \"They've heard of Amazon Prime Day. But, we sold as much in five minutes as Amazon sold in an entire Prime Day.\"\n\nAlibaba exceeded $4.68 billion in GMV in less than 10 minutes after 11/11 kicked off on Sunday morning.\n\nWhile not an exact match, Alibaba's Singles Day is similar to Amazon's Prime Day in many ways. Both \"holidays\" were created or built up for pretty much the sole purpose of offering deals and pushing sales.\n\nHowever, Singles Day is far larger than Prime Day. While Amazon does not release Prime Day sales figures, total online sales are estimated to have topped $4.2 billion over the company's 36-hour Prime Day event in July 2018, according to Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst Michael Pachter.\n\nAlibaba was crucial in making Singles Day, previously an obscure holiday observed by just a handful of companies, a massive cultural phenomenon over the last decade. This is the 10th year that the company has celebrated 11/11.\n\nAs the company celebrated a decade of Singles Day, Alibaba executives emphasized the need to find new ways to continue to evolve, whether that means expanding in different regions or exploring new types of business. This year, more than 20 Alibaba-owned businesses including online shopping site Taobao, delivery platform Ele.me, and supermarket chain Hema participated in 11/11 deals.\n\n\"Philosophically, how we look at whether we got into one business or another ... we never ask ourselves whether this is a lucrative area or whether it's going to be a commercially successful thing,\" Alibaba cofounder and executive vice chairman Joe Tsai told Business Insider.\n\n\"We do things out of necessity and we do things out of fear,\" Tsai continued, citing Alibaba's 2003 launch of Taobao to shut down the threat of eBay expanding in China.\n\n\"There's a high sense of paranoia within the company.\"", "Incoming House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff warned that any of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's ulterior motives in overseeing the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe would be exposed if he did not recuse himself from the investigation.\n\nSchiff told host Chuck Todd on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Democrats were prepared to challenge Whitaker's legitimacy in overseeing the Russia investigation and Mueller.\n\n\"I want to make this very clear, if he doesn't recuse himself, if he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe we are going to find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe,\" Schiff said. \"Whether he is serving as a back channel to the president or his lawyers about the probe, whether he's doing anything to interfere with the probe.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Mr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer. Any role that he plays will be exposed to the public. We don't want there to be any ambiguity about that.\"\n\nSince he was announced as Jeff Sessions' successor, Whitaker's independence has been widely questioned due to his past record and statements on the Justice Department's authority and the Mueller probe.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Whitaker does not plan to recuse himself and would block Mueller from subpoenaing Trump if the president does not agree to a sit-down interview.\n\nRead more:While he was Jeff Sessions' top aide, Matthew Whitaker reportedly advised Trump on how he could force the DOJ to cave to his demands\n\nDepartment of Justice ethics officials will reportedly examine Whitaker's work and public record to determine any financial or personal conflicts that could interfere with his oversight of the Russia probe.

In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.\"\n\nThis is brilliant, largely because I can stop feeling bad about myself for not being able to resist the siren call of Diet Coke, or Facebook, or the snooze button, or \u2026 lots of things.\n\nThe study Clear mentions is an oft-cited paper published in 2012, in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\n\nResearchers gave Blackberries to more than 200 people and pinged them throughout the day, reminding them to record whether they were currently experiencing any desires \u2014 to eat, to drink, to smoke, etc \u2014 whether they were trying to resist the temptation, and whether they'd ultimately given in. The researchers also measured participants' general levels of self-control.\n\nAs it turned out, the people with the highest levels of self-control were no better able to resist temptation than anyone else. But they did experience fewer desires. The researchers say their results suggest that \"high self-control operates more by avoiding temptations in the first place than by resisting them.\"\n\nRead more:The founder of PayPal uses data to optimize every aspect of his life \u2014 and he says being healthier comes down to a single habit\n\nIf you want to stop mindlessly snacking during the day, you may have to reorganize your workspace\n\nReading this section of \"Atomic Habits,\" I was reminded of a study I covered a few years ago, about an experiment that was conducted in a Google kitchen.\n\nFor the study, which was published in the journal Appetite, researchers redesigned the kitchen so that one beverage station was located closer to a snack bar than the other. Results showed that Googlers who visited the beverage station closer to the snacks were 69% more likely to grab a snack than those who used the beverage station farther away.\n\nIn other words: Fighting the urge to snack (assuming you're not actually hungry) only becomes a thing when there are snacks in front of you. If you don't walk by the place where there are snacks, you'll probably be fine.\n\nA Reddit thread (which we first spotted through Ramit Sethi's daily email) yields similar insights. In response to the question, \"'Thin' women, how much effort do you put to stay at that weight?\" multiple people answered that they don't put in much effort at all. As soon as they got into the habit of, say, only eating vegan food or never eating food out of a box, it didn't take much for them to stay on track.\n\nTo be sure, not every bad habit will disappear when you restructure your environment. If you're a cigarette smoker, staying out of bars might help, but it probably won't solve the problem immediately.\n\nStill, it's reassuring to know that disciplined people are really just trickier people. Go forth and join their ranks!", "Artificial intelligence promises to reduce car accidents through autonomous driving and crime through facial recognition.\n\nIt might also help companies tackle the pervasive problems of workplace harassment and discrimination.\n\nThat's the theory of the founders of Spot, a chatbot designed to help the victims of harassment and discrimination document their experiences. Spot uses natural language processing \u2014 and AI technology \u2014 to understand users and respond with appropriate follow-up questions. The system is built around decades of research into how to best help people recall emotional events reliably and with as much detail as possible.\n\n\"We saw was this massive need for better reporting tools in the area of harassment,\" said Julia Shaw, a cofounder of Spot and a research associate at University College London.\n\nSpot is a chatbot built around the cognitive-interview process\n\nWorking under the auspices of All Turtles, the AI app incubator created by former Evernote CEO Phil Libin, Shaw and her cofounders launched the chatbot as a free service for individuals earlier this year. Late last month, they rolled out versions of Spot for small businesses and larger corporations that are designed to help them track and follow up on reports of harassment and discrimination.\n\nRead more: The founder of a beloved productivity app thinks the startup model is broken \u2014 here's how he's trying to keep the tech industry from 'making the same 10,000 mistakes over and over again'\n\nA screenshot of a sample conversation with the Spot chatbot. Spot The chatbot is designed around the so-called cognitive-interview process, a method of questioning that's been shown to encourage people to accurately recall past events. It usually relies on open-ended queries and questions that try to get at what the respondents were thinking or feeling during the time of the events they're trying to remember.\n\nSpot's questions follow a strict protocol dictated by the guidelines of the cognitive-interview method. But the system relies on its natural language processing to respond specifically to the answers that users give.\n\nAt the end of the process, users have a document that they can edit and then save or submit to their employer or human resources department.\n\nCreating Spot was a 'magical' moment for Julia Shaw\n\nShaw and her cofounders came up with the idea for Spot in July 2017. After Libin met Shaw at a conference in London, he invited her to come see what his team was doing at All Turtles and talk with them about her research into how people form memories.\n\nInitially, Shaw thought they might work on an application that could assist people to better remember general events. But their conversations were taking place as accounts of sexual harassment in the tech industry and elsewhere were starting to gain major attention. Susan Fowler had already set off a chain reaction at Uber with her account of the harassment she said she experienced there, and others in the industry were coming forward to share their experiences.\n\nSo, as Shaw and her eventual cofounders talked through her research and the potential app, they narrowed its focus to helping people remember and record harassment or discrimination. Within four days, they'd figured out a basic plan for the chatbot.\n\n\"I arrived as an academic and left as a cofounder of a company,\" Shaw said. \"It was magical.\"\n\nHarassment and discrimination are big workplace problems\n\nThere was and is good reason to think that a tool such as Spot is needed.\n\nAs the #MeToo movement and a growing body of research have highlighted, harassment and discrimination are widespread in the business world. Depending on how the questions are asked, some 25% to 85% of women have experienced sexual harassment at work, a 2016 study from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported. Some 13% of men have been sexually harassed at work, according to a study earlier this year by the group Stop Street Harassment.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers have found that anywhere from 40% of 70% people who come from racial- or ethnic-minority groups have experienced workplace harassment due to their race or ethnicity.\n\nThe vast majority of these incidents go unreported. Three out of four victims of harassment of any kind never tell a supervisor, manager, or union representative about it, the EEOC found. Among victims of sexual harassment in particular, only one in 10 women and just one in 20 men filed a formal complaint or reported their experience to an authority figure, according to the Stop Street Harassment study.\n\nWhile harassment and discrimination obviously harm those who experience it, it can hurt the companies where the incidents take place too. Such incidents can damage employee morale, reduce productivity, increase employee turnover, tarnish corporate reputations, and lead to costly legal actions.\n\nSpot is designed to make it easier for victims to report their experiences\n\nVictims don't report their experiences for a variety of reasons, experts say. Many worry that they won't be believed or that their superiors or others in a company will retaliate against them. Some also worry that their human resources department is conflicted or won't do anything in response to their report.\n\n\"The fear of retribution and the lack of trust are real,\" said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley, and the founding director of the school's Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership.\n\nThe fear of retribution and the lack of trust are real.\n\nSpot's founders designed the service to make it easier for victims to report their experiences. Many people feel more comfortable talking to a chatbot rather than a live person, Shaw said. It's not as emotionally charged. Victims can document what happened deliberately and extensively without feeling like they're under some kind of time pressure.\n\nUnlike some other tools on the market, Spot is intentionally designed to document more than just sexual harassment. People can use it to relate any kind of harassment or discrimination they've experienced at the office.\n\n\"If you build a tool \u2026 just for sexual harassment, you can leave out people who aren't sure why they're being disadvantaged or harassed at work,\" Shaw said.\n\nVictims can choose to report what happened \u2014 or not\n\nAnd Spot has features that address other concerns. Those documenting their experiences don't ever have to turn those records into official reports, for example. If they want to, they can just use the service to sort out what happened to them and what they think and feel about it.\n\n\"It can be really cathartic just to have a place to go and to really structure your thoughts,\" Shaw said.\n\nIf they do choose to submit a report, they can do so anonymously and can edit the document before submitting it to remove details that might identify them or others. What victims decide to do with their record is then entirely up to them.\n\n\"It depends on what [they] think is the most reasonable course of action,\" Shaw said.\n\nAfter a past incident, a UK bank decided to give Spot a go\n\nWith the new business versions of Spot, companies can roll out the service to their workforces. The corporate version offers an online dashboard that human resource departments can use to monitor and follow up on reports that have been filed. The service will also email company representatives or send them notifications over the Slack messaging service when a report has been filed or updated.\n\nSpot has a dashboard for corporate users to track and respond to harassment and discrimination reports filed through its system. Spot Monzo, a financial-services company based in London that offers mobile banking, rolled out Spot to its employees as soon as the enterprise version was launched last month. The startup company is trying to differentiate itself from more traditional banks, and company leaders wanted to promote a culture that is respectful and supportive of employees, said Ellie Macdonald, who helps run the company's human resources department as its people partner.\n\nThe company had an incident in the past in which it would have been helpful to have a service like Spot, she said, declining to go into detail about it.\n\n\"We thought, hey, wouldn't it be good to have some kind of tool where people feel a little more comfortable in reporting these things?\" Macdonald said.\n\nSpot charges $2 per employee a month for the enterprise version of its service. For small businesses, it charges $1,200 a year, although it initially charged just $800.\n\nExperts say it could be a useful tool\n\nThat tie to corporate human resources departments could prove problematic, McElhaney said. If victims of harassment see the service as being too closely tied to their companies or worry that they might be exposed if they use it, they could be reluctant to do so, she said.\n\nWhat's more, victims of harassment and discrimination often require more than just someone or something to record their experiences accurately, McElhaney said. They often need access or a referral to a counselor or therapist to work through their emotions. They also often want or need access to legal advisers to discuss their legal rights.\n\nThe good news on this product is I would think it would be correlate with an increase in reporting.\n\nAnd people are different. Some might prefer recounting their experiences to a trained person rather than to a computer, said Amy Leisenring, who has written about and taught gender issues as a professor of sociology at San Jose State University.\n\n\"It would depend on the person,\" she said.\n\nBut both McElhaney and Leisenring said the service could prove a useful tool in the fight against harassment and discrimination. It seems well designed to help victims process and report what happened to them, Leisenring said. By allowing them to decide whether to report or not, it gives them power and some measure of control over the process, McElhaney said.\n\n\"The good news on this product is I would think it would be correlate with an increase in reporting,\" she said.\n\nThat's precisely what Shaw and her cofounders are hoping for.\n\nNow read:", "The UK economy took a hit of \u00a3250 million ($328 million) a day for about 24 days one summer in 2015. British coastguards were sent out in droves with bottles of water and emergency meals. One official called the situation \"absolute mayhem.\"\n\nThe cause: a massive traffic jam in the south-east of England. Trucks carrying goods to continental Europe couldn't cross over the English Channel to the French port city of Calais, which receives truck-loaded ferries coming from Dover in Kent, England.\n\nUp to 9,000 trucks\u2014 or lorries, as the Brits call them \u2014 were parked on England's M20 motorway for 24 days in the summer of 2015.\n\nWhile the summer of 2015 was a particularly bad back-up in England, strikes that shut down Calais (and thus, the rest of Europe) to England are common. France as a whole has an incredibly robust \"strike culture.\" Each year, 171 days of work are missed per 1,000 employees in France, the second biggest in Europe. (In Germany, just 12 days per year are missed.)\n\n\"It's part of the character of France to have these big social movements at a national level, that can last a long time,\" French historian St\u00e9phane Sirot told English-language French news outlet The Local.\n\nAnd that tendency to strike is highly evident in Calais. Strikes affecting the port city are so common, in fact, that the south-east English county of Kent, where these truck back-ups happen, has created a parking scheme called \"Operation Stack\" to accommodate those trucks.\n\nIt's been enacted more than 100 times since 1997, most recently in May 2018. Operation Stack has also been deployed in times of inclement weather, fires, or industrial action on the UK side.\n\nRead more: A British truck driver who's worked in the US for a decade says the biggest problem with trucking in America comes down to how drivers are paid\n\nOperation Stack has a slightly panic-inducing name, but the procedure is simple.\n\nAccording to the county website, Kent's police ensure that trucks park on both sides of M20 and line up as they wait for ferry operations at Calais to re-open. The middle lane remains clear for emergency vehicles. Passenger cars are re-routed to other freeways.\n\nSome truckers were stranded for days during the 2015 deployment of Operation Stack. Rob Stothard/Getty Images\n\nWhen it's enacted, people who rely on the motorway for daily work and travel get frustrated. A Conservative lawmaker said Operation Stack caused locals to feel \"stranded, completely cut off in their own town.\"\n\nThe disruption at Calais has also posed a serious security risk at times. In 2015 \u2014 at the height of the migrant crisis \u2014 the British Road Haulage Association's chief executive Richard Burnett called for the military to be deployed as a security measure amid warnings that demonstrators setting fire to tyres and migrants attempting to enter the UK were putting hauliers' lives at risk.\n\nOperation Stack meets a post-Brexit world\n\nOperation Stack has typically come as a result of industrial action on the French side. The debacle in the summer of 2015 followed the closure of a French ferry service, which employed some 600 people.\n\nAround 100 port workers protested at the terminal, burning tires and halting traffic entering and exiting France.\n\nBut now, the Brexit referendum will only multiply the need for Operation Stack.\n\nTruck drivers wait out Operation Stack in 2015. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nBritish trucks will not be able to enter Europe if the UK and the EU cannot reach a deal on Brexit, Business Insider's Thomas Colson reported from London.\n\nAt the very least, lorries in post-Brexit Britain would need considerably more time to enter the EU if both sides fail to secure a deal. Rather than two minutes to check a vehicle, the BBC reported it would take five to 45 minutes for customs to process trucks.\n\nThat would create, according to a council report, a semi-permanent 13-mile stretch of trucks on one of Britain's most crucial roads.\n\nIn response, the UK's Department for Transport has created a replacement for Operation Stack: \"Operation Brock.\" This operation will allow passenger vehicles to drive in certain sections of the freeway, rather than diverting traffic to smaller roads as Operation Stack does.", "It's pumpkin pie season at Costco.\n\nAnd, if sales figures from past years are any indication, that means Costco members are about to carve into millions of pumpkin pies.\n\nAccording to a 2016 edition of Costco Connection, the warehouse chain sold a staggering 5.3 million pumpkin pies in 2015. Keep in mind that Costco only offers up the pies from September through December.\n\nA total of 1.75 million of those pumpkin pies were purchased in the three days running up to Thanksgiving.\n\nCostco Connection reported that making those 5.3 million pies required 1.1 million gallon cans of pureed pumpkins. That's approximately 3.4 million pumpkins. The company shares its sales projections with pumpkin farmers in the spring, so that growers can calculate how many fields they need to plant.\n\nCostco declined to comment on how many pies it has sold in the years since 2015 or how many pies it anticipates selling this year.\n\nThe recipe also calls for an undisclosed, pre-mixed blend of dry ingredients and spices, whole eggs, and water. The pumpkin pie doesn't include preservatives. All of the pies are 3.8 pounds, according to the Costco Connection.\n\nThe Costco Connection report credited the pie's recipe to Sue McConnaha, the warehouse chain's VP of bakery operations. As of the time of that article, the recipe hadn't changed since the pie first hit shelves in 1987, although the pies have grown from a 10-inch diameter to a 12-inch diameter.\n\nAnd Costco's pumpkin pie has proved to be a perennial favorite among some members. This year, fans of the holiday staple have taken to social media to praise the pie.", "Former President Bill Clinton has had a reputation for unhealthy eating habits, particularly before and during the early years of his presidency. In 1992, The New York Times dedicated a story to Clinton's diet before he took office, listing cinnamon rolls, barbecue, cheeseburgers, enchiladas, and pies among his favorite foods.\n\nDoe's Eat Place, a regional restaurant chain with a location in Little Rock, Arkansas \u2014 where Clinton served as governor from 1979-1981 and 1983-1992 \u2014 is perhaps the most famous of the dining establishments Clinton frequented before becoming president. Clinton held campaign events there, according to CBS affiliate THV-11, and was interviewed by Rolling Stone at the restaurant in 1992.\n\nDoe's specializes in simple, greasy food like steaks, burgers, and tamales. One of the restaurant's waiters described it as \"vegetarian hell\" to The Times in 1992.\n\nDuring a trip to Little Rock in October, I stopped at Doe's for lunch to see if it lived up to the hype. The food tasted great but left me feeling sluggish for hours afterward, so much so that I didn't eat for around 18 hours after my meal.\n\nClinton has adopted a healthier, vegan diet since the end of his presidency, and I can see why.\n\nHere's what it was like to eat at one of Bill Clinton's favorite restaurants.", "Autumn has arrived and with it the fifth installment of Business Insider's Car of the Year award.\n\nIn 2014 the Corvette Stingray was our winner. In 2015 it was the Volvo XC90. In 2016 the Acura NSX captured the trophy. And for 2017 we chose the Porsche Panamera. As with 2016 and 2017, we stuck with our lineup of 15 finalists for this year.\n\nOur esteemed finalists are the vehicles \u2014 from sedans to supercars to SUVs \u2014 that impressed us most. They're the best of the best and were selected after a year of test-driving and reviewing more than 60 cars, trucks, SUVs, crossovers, and sports cars.\n\nTo be eligible, a model must be new or have been substantially updated within the past year, and it must have been road tested by at least two members of the Business Insider team.\n\nIn 2018, senior correspondent Matt DeBord and senior reporter Ben Zhang shared the majority of reviewing duties, with news editor Bryan Logan lending a hand on the West Coast. Images were contributed by Hollis Johnson, Business Insider's photo editor, and Jessica Tyler, our visual-features reporter.\n\nOur methodology is straightforward, focused on basic questions:\n\nIs there a strong business case for the vehicle?\n\nDid our reviewers agree that the vehicle should be included? We have to come to a consensus, even though we might disagree on some particulars.\n\nWas the vehicle objectively excellent? There has to be some sort of wow! factor.\n\nDid the vehicle stand out from the sea of competition, particularly when it comes to technology? A Car of the Year finalist has to be special.\n\nCan we strongly recommend buying or leasing the car? We demand to know whether we'd buy the vehicle ourselves if we had the resources.\n\nWe'll announce the 2018 Car of the Year on November 19 and prepare you for the big event by revealing our five runners-up the week before. We'll also reveal who won Infotainment System of the Year and Audio System of the Year.\n\nSo here they are, the 15 finalists for Business Insider's 2018 Car of the Year:", "Traveling can be a hassle, but sometimes a specific airport makes the experience that much worse.\n\nThe travel website The Points Guy recently released its rankings of the 15 best and worst airports in the US. Using data from the Department of Transportation, the airports themselves, and third parties, the website evaluated each airport on factors such as timeliness of arrivals and departures, the number of lounges, options for dining and shopping, and the cost of transportation to and from the airport.\n\nLooking at amenities, accessibility, and timeliness, The Points Guy compiled a report ranking airports based on aspects it described as most important to travelers.\n\nRead more: These are the best and worst airports in America to get stranded at over the holiday season\n\nAnd from a traveler's angle, its rankings appear pretty objective.

History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again.\"", "As I put on a bulky white headset and adjusted it to fit my head, I found myself in a hospital room. One doctor leaned over a sleeping patient who had an air pumping device on his nose, while another was preparing tools. I felt like I was on an episode of \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nSuddenly, a floating robot head appeared, explaining that we would be learning how to identify and treat sleep apnea. It guided me towards the patient's nose, and before I knew it, I had jumped inside his nostril!\n\nSimforHealth Sleep Endoscopy Simulator SimforHealth\n\nThis was a simulation from SimforHealth, a French company that creates virtual reality simulations for medical students and pharmaceutical corporations. This simulation is supposed to teach medical students about sleep apnea, guiding students inside a virtual nose to show what happens to patients when they sleep. On this simulation, the inside of a nose looked like a pulsing red cave, with long, thin spikes coming out of the walls -- nose hairs, I assume.\n\nAlthough virtual reality is typically associated with consumers, such as for video gaming, the technology is increasingly being adopted for use in professional settings. VR and augmented reality are projected to grow to $162 billion by 2020, and more products are targeting enterprise use.\n\nSimforHealth Sleep Endoscopy Simulator Screen Shot\n\nOn Thursday, the VR company HTC VIVE announced its Vive Focus, an all-in-one headset that includes storage, built-in speakers and more. It's targeted at businesses and can used for education and training simulation, including at NASA and hospitals.\n\nWhat makes this hardware significant is that it's much simpler and more portable for customers to use, says Dan O'Brien, General Manager of the Americas at HTC VIVE. Other VR headsets that only developers may use might involve expensive hardware and require users to stay in one place.\n\nA user tries on the Vive Focus, a VR headset from HTC VIVE HTC VIVE\n\nThe possibilities for this are endless, O'Brien says. This could be used for surgical and medical training, like when medical students might work together to perform a virtual surgery. This could even be used for automotive design, where employees can prototype and design cars in VR, or even learn to fix cars. Innoactive, a German VR enterprise software company, had partnered with Volkswagen to create a training scenario for workers to learn to put together a car in a factory.\n\n\"Executives are understanding they can save time and money,\" O'Brien said. \"Their designers don't all have to fly to Germany to meet in one room and talk about design. They can go to VR design room and talk collaboratively there.\"\n\nVR can also be used to collaborate on code. Primitive, which creates software development visualizations, created an app to review code. When I tried out this simulation, I was transported to a dark space with floating lines of code connected by a laser web -- a scene almost straight out of \"The Matrix.\"\n\nPrimitive Code Immersion Screen Shot\n\nIt showed me how different files of code were linked, and with my laser pointer, I could pull up an entire floating page of code in front of my eyes. With this application, developers can work together to review code, circle the parts they want to highlight and dig through open source projects.\n\n\"It was quite fascinating because I was not a software coder myself,\" O'Brien said. \"It's also about efficiency. When I sat in and watched 5 developers get in the space together, they were having intense conversations about the code.\"\n\nRead more: How to pick out the best VR headset for you, even if you've never experienced virtual reality before\n\nIn addition, VIVE had also launched its own workforce collaboration tool built specifically for enterprise called the VIVE Sync. This can be used to help employees collaborate with each other in a virtual space, especially when they work remotely. Each employee's avatar can share ideas, show presentations, import images, show videos and more all in a 3D virtual space.\n\nIn the coming months, Vive plans to launch developer kits to add to the headset so developers can create their own applications for VR. Although the buzz around VR has died down, O'Brien believes there will be tremendous growth for VR in the enterprise space.\n\n\"We see it growing at a really rapid rate,\" O'Brien said. \"We have seen consumer VR grow at a healthy rate. Now enterprise is growing faster than consumer.\"", "When Instagram sold to Facebook for $1 billion in 2013, it felt like a massive sum of money.\n\nFive years later, we seem to be numb to the billion-dollar acquisitions and valuations around us.

Instead, Bezos envisions a more holistic relationship between work and life outside the office.\n\nHistorically, the world's richest man has a nontraditional approach to work: He makes time for breakfast every morning with his family, doesn't set his alarm before going to bed, schedules surprisingly few meetings, and still sets aside a few minutes every day to wash his own dishes.\n\nThis counterintuitive approach to maintaining a healthy symmetry within his professional and personal pursuits is one of the chief pieces of advice Bezos offers his staff.\n\n\"This work-life harmony thing is what I try to teach young employees and actually senior executives at Amazon too. But especially the people coming in,\" he said. \"I get asked about work-life balance all the time. And my view is, that's a debilitating phrase because it implies there's a strict trade-off.\"\n\nInstead of viewing work and life as a balancing act, Bezos said that it's more productive to view them as two integrated parts.\n\n\"It actually is a circle. It's not a balance,\" Bezos said.\n\nBezos said that the relationship between his work life and personal life is reciprocal, and that he doesn't compartmentalize them into two competing time constraints.\n\n\"If I am happy at home, I come into the office with tremendous energy,\" said Bezos. \"And if I am happy at work, I come home with tremendous energy.

While the third quarter didn't look that bad \u2014 Macau revenue was up over $200 million from the same time a year before \u2014 the casino giant had a dark outlook for the fourth quarter. Wynn projected earnings 20% below what Wall Street expected.\n\nAccording to analyst Cameron McKnight at Credit Suisse, this implies that the Macau gambling market could be negative over the last two months of 2018.\n\n\"Wynn noted that Golden Week was very strong in October, but business dropped sharply after that and has remained volatile since then,\" McKnight wrote in a note to clients. \"Further, the company noted that it does not believe it is losing share - this means their guidance is either extremely conservative or the market has turned negative in November and December.\"\n\nWynn's stock fell 12% on Thursday following the report.\n\nWynn makes the lion's share of its revenue from its two casinos in Macau, so of the American casino operators on the glittering Cotai Strip, Wynn is most susceptible to market volatility.\n\nBut of course this would be bad for the entire industry. A slowdown of the kind Wynn is projecting is a flashback to a dark time for the casino world, when a slowing Chinese economy and new government regulation sent casino revenues crashing as much as 50% in 2014 and 2015.\n\nStrip\n\nNow there are some on Wall Street, like Carlo Santarelli at Deutsche Bank, who think that Wynn made an \"overly conservative guide.\"\n\nAnd the gentleman is entitled to his opinion.\n\nBut macro data is on Wynn's side. As McKnight notes, gaming revenue tends to lag credit cycles on the mainland by 15 months, and as we know, about a year ago the Chinese government started to slow the flow of credit through its economy.\n\nCredit Suisse\n\nAnd then there's the housing market. McKnight posits that Macau gambling revenue lags Chinese housing prices by 8 months.\n\nCredit Suisse\n\nAll sorts of signals in China's housing market are flashing red right now. Earlier this week S&P warned that weaker Chinese property developers were in danger of default. Housing sales fell 3.6% in September, and new research indicates that 22% of all homes in China are unoccupied.\n\nSo far, as Societe Generale economist Wei Yao pointed out in a note to clients, China's real estate investment \u2014 which makes up half of all investment in the country \u2014 has stayed pretty stable. But she does not see that lasting very long.\n\nFrom a recent note to clients (emphasis ours):\n\n\"Real estate investment and construction growth remained surprisingly resilient in light of further weakening in housing sales. Investment growth strengthened from 13.8% in 2Q to 14.5% in 3Q, despite the slight moderation to 8.9% in September from 9.3% in August.\n\nGrowth in new floor space started surged to 27.8% in 3Q - the quickest since 2014 - from 16.6% in 2Q, thanks only partly to positive base effects.\n\nIn contrast, housing sales contracted by 3.6% in September, bringing down the quarterly growth rate to 2% from 3.1%. We still believe that demand determines supply, not the other way around, and that, as a result, the strong trend in housing supply is unsustainable.\"\n\nThe world will get fresh credit data from China next week, and perhaps it will show that policymakers have decided to loosen conditions in the face of a downturn and a potential trade war with the United States.\n\nEven so \u2014 since Chinese credit is leading Macau gaming revenue as an indicator \u2014 that means Macau will have to continue to work through some pain for the next few months.\n\nThe question is going to be not whether the pain is coming, but how long it's going to last.", "Some major industries could soon be shaken up by a new development in artificial intelligence\u2014 the technology's increasing portability.\n\nChip manufacturers are making processors specifically for machine learning and related AI features, noted Deloitte analysts David Schatsky, Jonathan Camhi, and Aniket Dongre in a new report. In many cases, those chips are being designed to consume minimal power, making it possible for them to be used in small, portable devices. Meanwhile, AI software developers are designing new algorithms that can be run directly on such chips without ever needing to connect to computers in the cloud.\n\nThe result is that we are about to enter an era that the analysts dubbed \"pervasive intelligence,\" filled with devices and sensors that have AI technologies embedded within them. That coming era could offer big business opportunities for some companies while also significantly threatening the business models of others.\n\n\"Smart machines may well help expand existing markets, threaten incumbents, and shift how profits are divided,\" the Deloitte analysts said in the report. \"The impacts could ultimately be significant,\" they continued.\n\nRead more: Amazon's cloud CEO just pooh-poohed employee concerns about selling its facial-recognition software to ICE and law enforcement\n\nWe're already starting to see the first developments in this era. Apple's latest iPhones include an AI chip it calls its Neural Engine that is designed to perform machine-learning tasks such as image recognition on the device. And earlier this year, researchers at MIT announced they'd designed an AI chip that's three to seven times faster than its predecessors while using 95% less power.\n\nSimilar chips could soon be placed in a wide range of devices and other products, from robots to internet of things gadgets, wind turbines to medical devices, the Deloitte analysts said. Processing AI tasks on such devices rather than in the cloud can allow them to respond more quickly to changing circumstances or dangerous situations. It also allows them to continue to function even when they can't connect to the internet. And it can help preserve privacy by limiting access to private data.\n\nHere are some of the industries that could be affected by such pervasive intelligence:", "A topless protester, likely part of the radical women's rights group Femen, got dangerously close to Donald Trump's car as she demonstrated against the US president's visit to Paris.\n\nTrump is in France to mark 100 years since the armistice that ended World War I.

Cummins had graduated top of his year in his subject and, as he put it, \"thought I had a pretty good CV.\"\n\nCummins filed his application and, like any Oxbridge graduate with a top-tier degree, expected the offers to roll in.\n\n\"I didn't even get a phone call,\" he told Business Insider during an interview at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon. \"I had a back and forth with a recruiter, but I never really understood it.\"\n\nCummins had the last laugh. Five years later, Google would go on to buy his first startup. And a few years after that, Google would also be integral to the success of his second.\n\nMark Cummins' first startup was Plink, an app that recognised artwork\n\nAfter several more job rejections, Cummins opted to stay at university and do a PhD in the then-unfashionable area of robotics and machine learning. This was before breakthroughs like DeepMind's AlphaGo made AI sexy again, and the entire field of learning was still emerging from a second \"AI winter.\"\n\nThe interest in robotics provided the germ of a startup idea. Cummins was working on place recognition for robots for his thesis, specifically around how they process images to determine their location.\n\n\"My PhD work was on a robot [that] would collect images as it drove along to determine: 'Have I come back to a place I've been before?'\" Cummins explained. \"The first iPhone had just come out, the first Androids were just coming out, and mobile was just starting to take off. I thought, this seems interesting, maybe we can do something with photo matching, so we launched a company around that.\"\n\nThe company, Plink, was a kind of Shazam for art. Users would photograph a piece of artwork, and the app would identify it. The app garnered 50,000 users in its first six weeks and Cummins and his cofounder, James Philbin, won $100,000 during an Android Developer Challenge. That brought the app to the attention of Google, Cummins' one-time dream employer.\n\nHugo Barra, once the face of Android at Google and now a Facebook executive. REUTERS\n\nGoogle began courting the startup and the young Oxford founders ended up meeting senior execs at the time, such as Android product spokesman Hugo Barra. They impressed the top brass enough to field an offer.\n\nThe pair accepted what Cummins described as a life-changing amount of money, and took jobs within Google. While Plink's consumer app shut down, its technology ended up being used in several Google image recognition services, such as Google Lens and Google Photos.\n\nCummins hit on his second startup idea while working at Google\n\nThree years later, Cummins had moved to Australia and was still working for Google. He had an inkling for his second startup when he realised there were still elementary questions the search engine couldn't answer for users.\n\nSpecifically, he was drinking craft beer at a party one night, and then wasn't able to find a nearby shop that sold the same brand. \"Where's the nearest store that has this product available? It seemed like a basic question,\" Cummins told Business Insider.\n\nThe problem is that most small local retailers don't bother to log all the inventory they have. Their cash registry, as Cummins put it, can \"look like it's from a Western.\" There's no way for consumers to know for sure whether a local shop is selling an item they need \u2014 and so they turn to Amazon and deprive the smaller retailer of valuable footfall.\n\nCummins began nosing around small retailers in Australia, asking what it would take for them to upload their inventory and make it searchable online. He concluded that some hardware would be required and set about looking for another technical cofounder.\n\nPhilbin, his Plink cofounder, had a young family and was not available. Cummins rang up another old friend from his Oxford days, Charles Bibby, a sailing expert who was in the middle of a yearlong sailing trip around the Mediterranean.\n\nBibby found the vision so compelling that he cut the trip short after three months and sailed home to start Pointy.\n\nPointy helps people find what their local shops have in stock\n\nPointy\n\nThe end result is the Pointy box, a small device that looks a little like a 9-volt battery.\n\nIt plugs into a retailer's barcode scanner and logs items as they're being scanned for purchase. Eventually, Pointy's software logs what a retailer is selling and can take a good guess as to when it's out of stock.\n\nThat information is then listed online on a dedicated page hosted by Pointy, so anyone trying to find a local shop that sells, for example scotch tape, can click on a Pointy link and see whether it's available nearby.\n\nPointy gives offline retailers dedicated online pages showing what's in stock Pointy\n\nWhile it's easy to see on Google when your local hardware store is open, it's currently quite difficult to check what it might have in stock. \"It's not ecommerce, it's more about driving footfall,\" said Cummins.\n\nThe box costs $499 for US retailers. Pointy also offers to place local ads for retailers on Google, and takes a slice of the ad revenue.\n\nIt feels like a strange decision to focus on bricks-and-mortar stores in the age of Amazon, but Cummins argues that online shopping only accounts for 10% of US commerce. The majority of the population still prefers to a trip to a local store when they need something.\n\nCummins says that Pointy \"ranks very well\" on Google. And over the summer, the startup announced a partnership with search firm that means product information appears on the \"knowledge panel\" in search and Google Maps.\n\nTo date, the firm has raised $19 million from Vulcan Capital, Polaris, LocalGlobe, Seedcamp and well-known angels such as Google Maps founder Lars Rasmussen, TransferWise cofounder Taavet Hinrikus, and WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg. It is headquartered in Dublin \u2014 Cummins is Irish \u2014 and manufactures the Pointy box in Ireland.\n\nFor now, Pointy is focused on persuading retailers to adopt its technology. Cummins says that 1% of all US retailers are on board, citing US Census Bureau statistics. That amounts to around 10,000 US retailers. It also has some pickup in its home market and across the UK.\n\nOn the consumer side, it looks like the startup is pretty reliant on Google \u2014 which is fine, as long as the firm plays ball and integrates Pointy's data into its search results. The current partnership is a blessing, but the startup might need to branch out to defend its turf. Cummins says Pointy plans to build out its offering so that retailers can do more than just have a store page online, but he wouldn't give any further detail at this point.\n\nAnd could another Google acquisition be in the offing? Cummins said his former employer was interested in a partnership with Pointy early in its development, but nothing more \u2014 and gives a firm denial that there might be a buyout. \"There's nothing on the cards,\" he says.", "If you thought the stock market correction in October was bad, you ain't seen nothing yet.\n\nSo says John Hussman, the former economics professor and current president of the Hussman Investment Trust.\n\nHe actually argues the market has been headed for an imminent reckoning since early February, another period that featured a sharp stock drawdown. That was the point when Hussman says so-called market internals started to deteriorate, leaving equities particularly vulnerable.\n\nHussman has become a big fan of the predictive power of market internals, which he says provide valuable signals on investor sentiment. They've taken on new significance to him since, as he describes it, valuations have been rendered largely useless \u2014 at least in the short term.\n\n\"Speculative psychology has always allowed valuations to run well beyond historical norms over portions of the market cycle,\" Hussman wrote in a recent blog post. \"Valuations only 'work' over the long-term and the full cycle.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Investor psychology \u2014 whether speculative or risk-averse \u2014 drives market outcomes over shorter segments of the market cycle. We read that psychology from the behavior of market internals.\"\n\nAnd, as the chart below shows, those internals have faltered since February. The blue line represents the cumulative total S&P 500 return in periods of uniform market internals. As you'll note, the line has flattened recently \u2014 just as it did in the periods preceding the 2000 and 2007 stock market collapses.\n\nHussman Funds\n\nThis chart behavior is one of many factors that have Hussman forecasting an eventual drop of more than 65% for US stocks.\n\n\"Despite its discomfort, the market decline we observed in October is only a drop in the bucket toward normalizing valuations,\" Hussman said. \"Over the completion of the current market cycle, I fully expect the S&P 500 to lose close to two-thirds of its value from the recent peak.\"\n\nA self-aware approach to market forecasts\n\nAs always, the obvious elephant in the room must be addressed when discussing Hussman's outlooks: He's been calling for the equity market to lose two-thirds of its value for months \u2014 including well before the February correction. But it hasn't happened yet.\n\nHussman thinks he knows why. He says the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates to zero completely dismantled the role of valuations in signaling perilous market conditions. With monetary conditions so loose, companies and investors alike blew past warning signs that would've stopped them before.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the moment interest rates hit zero, those limits vanished, and preemptively responding to speculative extremes became terrifically detrimental,\" Hussman said. \"We can no longer rely on well-defined limits to speculation, as we could in previous market cycles across history.\n\nHe added: \"In hindsight, the fix was simple: abandon the belief in any limit to the stupidity of Wall Street.\"\n\nIt took him a while, but Hussman says he's done this now. He's instead fully focused on the aforementioned market internals and the extent to which they highlight shifts in sentiment.\n\nHussman even acknowledges that \u2014 in the event of a recovery in market internals \u2014 he's willing to adopt a neutral stance on the market in the near term.\n\nEven though he's arguably the biggest long-term bear around, everyone has their limits.\n\nHussman's track record\n\nFor the uninitiated, Hussman has repeatedly made headlines by predicting a stock-market decline exceeding 60% and forecasting a full decade of negative equity returns. And as the stock market has continued to grind mostly higher, he's persisted with his calls, undeterred.\n\nBut before you dismiss Hussman as a wonky perma-bear, consider his track record, which he breaks down in his latest blog post. Here are the arguments he lays out:\n\nPredicted in March 2000 that tech stocks would plunge 83%, then the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index lost an \"improbably precise\" 83% during a period from 2000 to 2002\n\nPredicted in 2000 that the S&P 500 would likely see negative total returns over the following decade, which it did\n\nPredicted in April 2007 that the S&P 500 could lose 40%, then it lost 55% in the subsequent collapse from 2007 to 2009\n\nIn the end, the more evidence Hussman unearths around the stock market's unsustainable conditions, the more worried investors should get. Sure, there may still be returns to be realized in this market cycle, but at what point does the mounting risk of a crash become too unbearable?\n\nThat's a question investors will have to answer themselves. And one that Hussman will clearly keep exploring in the interim.", "Theresa May's Brexit deal is being declared dead before it has even been born.\n\nThe British prime minister is set for a crunch meeting with her Cabinet early this week, where she will attempt to get her EU withdrawal agreement signed off by senior ministers.\n\nBut even if she does get approval from her top team, there is growing concern that the Brexit deal will be voted down when it is put before MPs in December, according to a number of reports this weekend.\n\nDefeat in Parliament would be disastrous for May. It would significantly increase the chance of a no-deal Brexit and strike a catastrophic blow to her authority, likely provoking a leadership challenge.\n\nAt the centre of concerns remains proposals on how to keep open the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. There are fears that the so-called backstop agreement on the Irish border could make Britain a vassal state of the EU and increase the possibility of a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nTransport Minister Jo Johnson resigned on Friday, voicing fears held by both Brexiteers and those who wish to remain in the EU. \"To present the nation with a choice between two deeply unattractive outcomes, vassalage and chaos, is a failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis,\" he said.\n\nITV Political Editor Robert Peston wrote on Saturday that May's Brexit deal \"looks dead even before it's born.\" He said that without the support of Labour, May will lose a meaningful vote in Parliament.\n\n\"The destination is constitutional crisis, where legislature will be in irreconcilable conflict with executive, Commons at odds with PM and her cabinet,\" Peston said in a post on Facebook.\n\nRead more: Theresa May's government told leading medics UK can't rule out medicine shortages in a no-deal Brexit\n\nThis was supported by a report in The Sunday Telegraph, which said May's agreement will be blocked by MPs even if she secures Cabinet approval. \"She could force it through [Cabinet] with a majority, but she wouldn't get it through the Commons,\" one minister told the newspaper.\n\nFormer Brexit minister Steve Baker and the DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson, took the unusual step of joining forces to pen an open letter to May in The Sunday Telegraph. They said they would vote against her deal unless an alternative solution is found.\n\n\"We share the Prime Minister's ambition for an EU free trade agreement, but not at any price, and certainly not at the price of our union,\" they said. \"If the government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then, regrettably, we must vote against the deal.\"\n\nPeston, The Sunday Telegraph, and The Sunday Times all reported that there are likely to be more ministerial resignations.

Though Poland was ruled by Russia, Germany and Austria, and effectively was \"wiped off the map\" as a state, it was nonetheless a great age for Polish culture, producing the compositions of Frederic Chopin and the works of the great Romantic-era poet Adam Mickiewicz, which largely revolved around the yearning for Poland's rebirth.\n\nThroughout it all, the Roman Catholic church played a key role in keeping the language and the identity alive.\n\nContemplations of Poland's historic achievement in 1918 are inevitably shaped by knowledge of what came later, with Poland to be invaded and occupied yet again in the 20th century by the Germans and the Soviets, and then being under Moscow's influence during the Cold War era.", "LONDON \u2014 US President Donald Trump's \"hostile\" attitude towards the international world order has put international peace at risk, Theresa May's former national security chief has told Business Insider.\n\nSir Mark Lyall Grant, who was the UK national security adviser until last year's general election, said that Trump's actions had led to the \"erosion\" of the rules-based international order, a term used to describe the set of liberal western values and institutions like NATO and the UN which have promoted peace and stability since 1945.\n\n\"This liberal rules-based international order, which has kept the peace largely since the Second World War [...] and allowed huge prosperity, is now at risk as never before,\" Lyall Grant, currently a senior advisor at CTD Advisors, told Business Insider.\n\n\"At this particular time, the traditional champion of the rules-based international order \u2014 the President of the United States \u2014 doesn't actually believe in it himself,\" he said.\n\n\"He's not defending the order, and he's pretty hostile to the order at a time when it itself is under threat.\"\n\nLyall Grant said the UK is particularly at risk from a breakdown in the rules-based order because it has \"invested heavily\" in global institutions and because it is a small, open trading nation, with the UK a key member of crucial global institutions such as the UN Security Council, NATO, and the World Trade Organisation.\n\n'A new order'?\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping speaks during the official opening of the China-Zhuhai-Macau-Hong Kong Bridge in Zhuhai in south China's Guangdong province, Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2018.

He has repeatedly attacked the concept of \"globalism,\" pulled out of the Transpacific partnership, blocked the appointment of judges to the World Trade Organisation, and decertified the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nLyall Grant said that that the gradual \"erosion\" of that system predated Trump and had accelerated in recent years due to factors including the 2008 financial crisis, when \"the automatic superiority of capitalism and western markets was thrown into doubt.\"\n\nHe also said that western interventions in Iraq and Syria had contributed to a global pushback against the rules-based order because it created a perception that the West had \"exploited responsibility [...] to encroach on sovereignty and was overreaching by imposing our values on other countries.\"\n\nLyall Grant said that the vacuum left by Western leadership was dangerous because it risked the creation of a new global order led by China \u2014 one characterised by market authoritarianism and illiberal values.\n\n\"[Chinese] President Xi [...] has talked about a new order, based essentially on Chinese values.\"\n\n\"That would be a very different system from ours, in terms of where China comes from and what China stands for \u2014 and if that becomes the new governance order then that is a problem.

A group of pro-Remain business leaders last week also called for a second referendum. The former head of the civil service, Bob Kerslake, who now advises the Labour leader, also joined the calls in the past week, telling Business Insider that a second vote was now needed to prevent the \"catastrophe\" of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWhen pressed on whether that put her at odds with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2014 who would prefer a general election and a deal that meets his six tests \u2014 she laughed.\n\n\"It's very difficult, you are asking for more certainty from the opposition who are not in government than you are from the actual government, far more.\"\n\nAsked whether the country needed certainty, she replied: \"Well exactly, and we are a government in waiting. That's absolutely true. So I recognise that, but we haven't got the civil service [to provide administrative support], and Keir Starmer is in Brussels today.\"\n\nShe added that Starmer and Corbyn have both been to Brussels to confer with EU officials on alternatives to May's Brexit.\n\nStarmer is \"seeing, talking about what kind of deal we could have. He's in Brussels \u2014 Keir's been in Brussels a lot and so has Jeremy,\" Onwurah said.\n\nRead more: Polling data offers a clue to why Theresa May's own MPs have plotted against her so viciously.\n\nAsked if that amounted to a parallel set of talks that Brussels was holding with Labour, in the event that May's Conservative government falls, she replied that: \"There are talks ...

So there are definitely, Keir and Jeremy have been talking to our European sister parties and colleagues.\"\n\nOnwurah said she believed there were only about four Labour MPs \u2014 out of 257 in the 650-seat House of Commons \u2014 who were absolutely pro-Leave, and another 40 who are Remainers but represent constituencies that voted Leave, and thus might be open to backing May's deal.", "LISBON \u2014 As an engineering and computer science graduate from the University of Oxford, Mark Cummins fancied his chances of landing a job at Google.\n\nOxford is one of the most prestigious universities in the world and ranks highly on global league tables for computer science. Cummins had graduated top of his year in his subject and, as he put it, \"thought I had a pretty good CV.\"\n\nCummins filed his application and, like any Oxbridge graduate with a top-tier degree, expected the offers to roll in.\n\n\"I didn't even get a phone call,\" he told Business Insider during an interview at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon. \"I had a back and forth with a recruiter, but I never really understood it.\"\n\nCummins had the last laugh. Five years later, Google would go on to buy his first startup. And a few years after that, Google would also be integral to the success of his second.\n\nMark Cummins' first startup was Plink, an app that recognised artwork\n\nAfter several more job rejections, Cummins opted to stay at university and do a PhD in the then-unfashionable area of robotics and machine learning. This was before breakthroughs like DeepMind's AlphaGo made AI sexy again, and the entire field of learning was still emerging from a second \"AI winter.\"\n\nThe interest in robotics provided the germ of a startup idea. Cummins was working on place recognition for robots for his thesis, specifically around how they process images to determine their location.\n\n\"My PhD work was on a robot [that] would collect images as it drove along to determine: 'Have I come back to a place I've been before?'\" Cummins explained. \"The first iPhone had just come out, the first Androids were just coming out, and mobile was just starting to take off. I thought, this seems interesting, maybe we can do something with photo matching, so we launched a company around that.\"\n\nThe company, Plink, was a kind of Shazam for art. Users would photograph a piece of artwork, and the app would identify it. The app garnered 50,000 users in its first six weeks and Cummins and his cofounder, James Philbin, won $100,000 during an Android Developer Challenge. That brought the app to the attention of Google, Cummins' one-time dream employer.\n\nHugo Barra, once the face of Android at Google and now a Facebook executive. REUTERS\n\nGoogle began courting the startup and the young Oxford founders ended up meeting senior execs at the time, such as Android product spokesman Hugo Barra. They impressed the top brass enough to field an offer.\n\nThe pair accepted what Cummins described as a life-changing amount of money, and took jobs within Google. While Plink's consumer app shut down, its technology ended up being used in several Google image recognition services, such as Google Lens and Google Photos.\n\nCummins hit on his second startup idea while working at Google\n\nThree years later, Cummins had moved to Australia and was still working for Google. He had an inkling for his second startup when he realised there were still elementary questions the search engine couldn't answer for users.\n\nSpecifically, he was drinking craft beer at a party one night, and then wasn't able to find a nearby shop that sold the same brand. \"Where's the nearest store that has this product available? It seemed like a basic question,\" Cummins told Business Insider.\n\nThe problem is that most small local retailers don't bother to log all the inventory they have. Their cash registry, as Cummins put it, can \"look like it's from a Western.\" There's no way for consumers to know for sure whether a local shop is selling an item they need \u2014 and so they turn to Amazon and deprive the smaller retailer of valuable footfall.\n\nCummins began nosing around small retailers in Australia, asking what it would take for them to upload their inventory and make it searchable online. He concluded that some hardware would be required and set about looking for another technical cofounder.\n\nPhilbin, his Plink cofounder, had a young family and was not available. Cummins rang up another old friend from his Oxford days, Charles Bibby, a sailing expert who was in the middle of a yearlong sailing trip around the Mediterranean.\n\nBibby found the vision so compelling that he cut the trip short after three months and sailed home to start Pointy.\n\nPointy helps people find what their local shops have in stock\n\nPointy\n\nThe end result is the Pointy box, a small device that looks a little like a 9-volt battery.\n\nIt plugs into a retailer's barcode scanner and logs items as they're being scanned for purchase. Eventually, Pointy's software logs what a retailer is selling and can take a good guess as to when it's out of stock.\n\nThat information is then listed online on a dedicated page hosted by Pointy, so anyone trying to find a local shop that sells, for example scotch tape, can click on a Pointy link and see whether it's available nearby.\n\nPointy gives offline retailers dedicated online pages showing what's in stock Pointy\n\nWhile it's easy to see on Google when your local hardware store is open, it's currently quite difficult to check what it might have in stock. \"It's not ecommerce, it's more about driving footfall,\" said Cummins.\n\nThe box costs $499 for US retailers. Pointy also offers to place local ads for retailers on Google, and takes a slice of the ad revenue.\n\nIt feels like a strange decision to focus on bricks-and-mortar stores in the age of Amazon, but Cummins argues that online shopping only accounts for 10% of US commerce. The majority of the population still prefers to a trip to a local store when they need something.\n\nCummins says that Pointy \"ranks very well\" on Google. And over the summer, the startup announced a partnership with search firm that means product information appears on the \"knowledge panel\" in search and Google Maps.\n\nTo date, the firm has raised $19 million from Vulcan Capital, Polaris, LocalGlobe, Seedcamp and well-known angels such as Google Maps founder Lars Rasmussen, TransferWise cofounder Taavet Hinrikus, and WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg. It is headquartered in Dublin \u2014 Cummins is Irish \u2014 and manufactures the Pointy box in Ireland.\n\nFor now, Pointy is focused on persuading retailers to adopt its technology. Cummins says that 1% of all US retailers are on board, citing US Census Bureau statistics. That amounts to around 10,000 US retailers. It also has some pickup in its home market and across the UK.\n\nOn the consumer side, it looks like the startup is pretty reliant on Google \u2014 which is fine, as long as the firm plays ball and integrates Pointy's data into its search results. The current partnership is a blessing, but the startup might need to branch out to defend its turf. Cummins says Pointy plans to build out its offering so that retailers can do more than just have a store page online, but he wouldn't give any further detail at this point.\n\nAnd could another Google acquisition be in the offing? Cummins said his former employer was interested in a partnership with Pointy early in its development, but nothing more \u2014 and gives a firm denial that there might be a buyout. \"There's nothing on the cards,\" he says.", "A study from the Pew Research Center has delved into how we use and interact with the world's biggest video site \u2014 YouTube.\n\nAs well as looking at how people use YouTube, it also examined how YouTube influences people through its algorithm, which recommends videos in the \"Up next\" section.\n\nPew compiled a list of the 50 most recommended videos on YouTube.

Gen. John C. Millard. \"By conducting a thorough review and investigation, we hope to provide answers to the families of brave Airmen that lost their lives and prevent future occurrences and tragedies.\"\n\nMillard's team spent close to a month reviewing an array of evidence including interviews, logs, video, briefing materials, and inspection of aircraft wreckage before assembling a detailed sequence of events surrounding the crash.\n\nAccording to the report, the left outermost engine experienced problems and investigators found that the crew's mismanagement of the malfunction deviated from standard procedures. Failure to follow those procedures made further action by the pilot result in loss of control of the aircraft, causing it to crash.\n\nThe plane was assigned to a crew from the 156th Airlift Wing in Muniz Air Base from Puerto Rico. Their mission was to deliver the C-130 plane from Savannah to an Air Force base in Arizona commonly referred to as the \"Boneyard\", where it would be decommissioned.\n\nThe pilot of the plane was previously identified as Maj.
