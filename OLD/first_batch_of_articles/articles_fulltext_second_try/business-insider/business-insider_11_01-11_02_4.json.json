["Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing was ordered at the \"highest levels\" of the Saudi government and is calling on Riyadh to be more cooperative moving forward.\n\nBut critics say the Turkish leader is also part of the problem, and that neither Turkey nor Saudi Arabia have been particularly transparent since Khashoggi disappeared one month ago on October 2.\n\n\"We know that the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government,\" Erdogan said in an op-ed for The Washington Post, where Khashoggi was a columnist. \"A month after his killing, we still do not know where his body is. At the very least, he deserves a proper burial in line with Islamic customs.\"\n\nErdogan went on to accuse Saudi officials of continuing to \"cover up the murder,\" decrying the Saudi public prosecutor for refusing to \"cooperate with the investigation and answer even simple questions\" during a recent visit to Istanbul.\n\nThe Saudis have shifted their story multiple times\n\nThe Turkish leader is correct the Saudis have not provided answers to basic aspects of the case, such as where Khashoggi's body is. The Saudis have shifted their narrative on Khashoggi's killing multiple times, but recently admitted it was premeditated. With that said, they've not revealed who ordered the killing.\n\nThe Saudis have also arrested 18 people in connection with the case, but are refusing to extradite them to Istanbul where the crime was committed.\n\nRead more: Khashoggi's brutal killing could lead to charges against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman under international law. But experts say the Saudis will 'never go along.'\n\nIstanbul's chief prosecutor earlier this week expressed similar frustrations to Erdogan over these factors, and Saudi Arabia does seem to be evading and stalling so that the world will forget about Khashoggi and stop pushing for answers.\n\nKhashoggi's killing is widely suspected to have been orchestrated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis incident has already been a major crisis for the Saudis and placed strains on its relationship with the US. But if it was proven without question that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, it would be beyond calamitous for the kingdom and the consequences would be immeasurable. Some experts have contended Prince Mohammed could even face charges under international law.\n\nBut others warn nothing concrete will happen until there's a transparent, independent investigation.\n\n'What we have are two so-called investigations'\n\nSherine Tadros, head of the UN office for Amnesty International in New York, has been among the most vocal proponents of such an inquiry. Tadros recently told Business Insider neither the Saudis nor Turkey are genuinely interested in such an investigation, however, despite Erdogan's attempts to appear sincerely disconcerted by Khashoggi's fate.\n\n\"What we have are two so-called investigations,\" Tadros told Business Insider. Tadros said the \"best shot we have\" at legitimate justice for Khashoggi is a \"UN investigation that will be transparent, not politicized, and credible.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day the Saudis have clearly had a very destructive hand in the events that went on inside of that consulate,\" Tadros added. \"They don't want to see a real investigation happen.\"\n\nTurkey's conduct has been 'highly suspect'\n\nMeanwhile, Tadros also said the way Turkey has conducted itself has been \"highly suspect\" and \"highly politicized.\"\n\nOver the past week, Turkey offered its most official description yet of the events surrounding Khashoggi's death.\n\nIstanbul's chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan on Wednesday said an investigation into Khashoggi's killing concluded he was strangulated shortly after entering the consulate and subsequently dismembered. Prior to this, many of the purported details surrounding Khashoggi's disappearance were a product of leaks from Turkish officials to local and international media.\n\nRead more: Saudi Arabia hopes the world will forget about Jamal Khashoggi's killing, and still hasn't answered simple questions about his death\n\nSome of these leaks have been contradicted by public statements some Turkish officials have made, which has made it difficult to discern exactly what happened.\n\nIn this context, Tadros said the UN needs to be allowed into Turkey to conduct an independent probe. The UN has repeatedly expressed a willingness to do so, but Tadros suspects Erdogan is not particularly fond of this idea due to his dubious record on human rights and freedom of the press. Permitting the UN to investigate the murder of a journalist on Turkish soil would set a precedent for future inquiries that could prove uncomfortable for Erdogan, she said.\n\nBut for such an investigation to happen, Turkey needs to write a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres formally requesting a probe, Tadros said.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists, Human Rights Watch, and Reporters Without Borders have also called on Turkey to ask the UN to conduct an investigation. And more than 100 prominent writers, actors, and activists signed a letter this week calling for the UN to launch an independent probe into Khashoggi's death.\n\nErdogan is complaining that Saudi Arabia is impeding a legitimate investigation by not cooperating with Turkish officials, but by ignoring widespread calls for him to formally request a timely, independent UN probe he's arguably guilty of the same thing.\n\nThe Turkish leader in his op-ed for The Post claimed his government has \"moved heaven and earth to shed light on all aspects of this case.\" Based on the limited details Turkey has officially released and the lack of an independent investigation, this is a bold statement.\n\nTurkey on October 23 said it would cooperate if the the UN and international bodies call for an independent probe into Khashoggi's death.\n\nThe UN has done so repeatedly, so the ball is in Turkey's court.", "TikTok \u2014 an app you may have never heard of before \u2014 was the most downloaded app in the US in September, according to a TechCrunch report on Friday using data from SensorTower.\n\nFor the first time in the US, TikTok had more downloads than Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat in a given month.\n\nTikTok had 3.81 million downloads from the iOS App Store and Google Play combined in September.

John Hanna/AP\n\nKansas' 2nd district, considered a safe Republican seat for decades, has been thrown into play by the retirement of incumbent Lynn Jenkins.\n\nThe Republican: Former US Army Airborne Ranger and federal defense contractor Steve Watkins seemingly came out of nowhere to win a crowded Republican primary with just 22% of the vote, largely due to hundreds of thousands of dollars poured into the race by his father.\n\nWatkins was practically unknown to Republican leaders and voters before running for Congress and was criticized during the primary for taking meetings with Democratic party officials in 2017, living and voting outside Kansas for most of life, and not having a clear policy record to look to.\n\nThe Democrat: Paul Davis is an attorney by training who served five terms in the Kansas House of Representatives, including almost 10 years as minority leader. He narrowly lost in a run for the Governor of Kansas by 3.7 points in 2014.\n\nDavis says he wants to use his record of bipartisanship and working across the aisle in the Kansas legislature to help reform Washington. He is one of many Democratic congressional candidates who have publicly rejected Nancy Pelosi's leadership.\n\nThe lay of the land: Kansas' 2nd district includes most of the Eastern part of the state, including the capital city of Topeka and the city of Leavenworth, home to a US Army base. The rest of the district is largely rural and agricultural.\n\nPartisan dynamics: The 2nd district is one of the most solidly Republican of FiveThirtyEight's toss-ups. It has an R+10 partisan lean and was carried by Trump in the 2016 election by a whopping 19 points. It was, however, briefly represented by a Democrat from 2007 to 2009.\n\nRatings & predictions: FiveThirtyEight rates the race as a \"toss-up,\" giving Davis a 5 in 9 chance of winning. An October 27-31 NYT/Siena College poll showed Davis leading Watkins by 4 points, 41% to 37%.\n\nWhat the local experts say:\n\n\"[Watkins] has tied himself pretty closely to Trump. He's trying very hard to appeal to that conservative base,\" Jim McLean, a politics reporter and editor at Kansas News Service, told KCUR in August.\n\n\"We shouldn't forget that Trump won the 2nd district pretty handily in the 2016 presidential election,\" McLean said. \"However, Paul Davis also won that district when he ran for governor in 2014, so it's looks like it's going to be a pretty interesting race.\"\n\nMcLean said Davis' visibility and extensive record in Kansas politics combined with his his repudiation of Pelosi, a deeply unpopular figure among Republicans, could help him make up ground in such a solidly Republican district.\n\n\"His political profile as a moderate Democrat willing to work across the aisle might be appealing to voters in this district,\" he said.", "In 25 states some voters can submit their ballots via email or through an online portal.

You can use your Echo to answer questions about the weather and a myriad of other things and control other smart home devices. These devices can also learn thousands of third-party skills. The biggest difference between the Echo and the Echo Dot is their size; the Echo is larger and has a better speaker. The new 3rd-generation Echo Dot that was released in October 2018 has a better speaker than the 2nd generation that's included in this sale, but for a few reasons, we still think the 2nd generation is ultimately a better value for most people.\n\nTwo Fire Tablets are currently discounted by as much as $15 when bundled with Show Mode charging docs, which give the devices TV-like functionality. The Fire HD 8 ($10 off) and Fire HD 10 ($15 off) both have an HD screen, 10 hours of battery life (the Fire 7 only gets eight), and dual stereo speakers for better sound. Both also have Alexa built into them.\n\nFinally, Amazon's 3rd-generation Echo Dot and all-new Fire TV Stick 4K are bundled together for a savings of $20. The 3rd-generation Echo Dot has an updated look and a better internal speaker, and the new Fire TV Stick 4K is a massive improvement over the one it replaces. The new stick can stream video in 4K with HDR, which essentially means that whatever you're streaming will look crisp and vivid.

Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nDaylight saving time is a killer.\n\nThe annual ritual in which we trade an hour of morning light for evening brightness may seem like a harmless shift.\n\nBut each year, on the Monday after the springtime switch, hospitals report a 24% spike in heart attack visits around the country.\n\nDoctors see the opposite trend in the fall: The day after we turn back the clocks, heart attack visits drop 21% as people enjoy a little extra pillow time.\n\nOn Sunday, November 4, instead of the clock turning from 1:59 to 2:00 a.m., it will repeat the hour, ticking back to 1:00 a.m. again. (Shift-workers, worry not: federal law mandates you will still get paid for that extra hour of moonlit work.) That extra hour of rest may seem like good news this weekend, but over the long haul, the interrupted sleep schedules that result from shifting the clocks back and forth may be bad for our health.\n\nResearchers estimate that each spring we deprive ourselves of an extra 40 minutes of sleep because of the change. Our bodies may not fully recover from the shift for weeks, though the tragic heart attack trend only lasts about a day. We're also prone to make more deadly mistakes on the roads: Researchers estimate that car crashes in the US caused by sleepy daylight-saving drivers likely cost 30 extra people their lives over the nine-year period from 2002-2011.\n\n\"That's how fragile and susceptible your body is to even just one hour of lost sleep,\" sleep expert Matthew Walker, author of How We Sleep, previously told Business Insider.\n\n\"The brain, by way of attention lapses and micro-sleeps, is just as sensitive as the heart to very small perturbations of sleep,\" Walker explains in his book.\n\nThe problems don't stop there. DST also causes more reports of injuries at work, more strokes, and may lead to a temporary bump in suicides.\n\nWhy we 'save' daylight for the evenings\n\nDaylight Saving Time was originally concocted as a way to save energy, and was implemented during World War I in Germany. But more recent research suggests it's probably not saving us any megawatts of power at all. There is some evidence, however, that extra evening light can reduce crime and increase the time people spend exercising, at least in certain climates.\n\nIn 2018, daylight-saving time or DST ends on Sunday, November 4 at 2:00 a.m. Skye Gould/Business Insider Worldwide, fewer than half of all countries participate in this biannual clock-changing ritual.\n\nNot everyone in the US abides by the clock-shifting rule, either. Hawaii and Arizona already ignore DST, as it makes less sense to shift the clocks when you live near the equator, where the sun rises and sets at roughly the same time every day.\n\nCalifornia voters are also heading to the polls on Tuesday to decide whether they want to ditch the switch.

If you were to just put color in here right now, it would kinda come out looking like cherry cough syrup because blood is a little opaque, it's not completely see-through, so we add an opacifier to it, to make it opaque before we start to color it.\n\nSo, basically, what you get is kind of this white-looking slurry, then we can start to color it. And we go through a lot of food coloring. Obviously, the base is red.

The nose is probably one of the least appreciated organs in the body. The nose's job is unbelievable when you start to think about it.\n\nSo, we breathe in liters and liters of air. And what is our nose doing? It's actually able to take air that might be zero degrees or 100 degrees, and as you breathe it in, it gets the air to body temperature. The air could be very dry or very moist with humidity. It actually brings the air to a particular state of humidity, and it filters all the particles that we're breathing in.\n\nIt does this through massive amounts of blood flow through the nasal membranes. These membranes are very reactive, they react to temperature changes, they react to particulate matter in the air, and the blood flow will actually change very dramatically inside of the nose. With these extreme changes in temperature, from hot to cold, the blood flow changes, and with that comes changes in the flow of mucus.\n\nSo, one's nose may run watery when we're in really cold temperatures because the nose is actually trying to moisturize and heat that air.

Not quite. Too many trips to the gym or cardio sessions could actually undo all of those gains you've been working towards. Worse, they might be doing damage to your heart, arteries, and causing your brain to become addicted to exercise. Scary stuff!\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nExercising is supposed to be good for you. It can help you stay at a healthy weight, improve your cardiovascular health, and even ward off depression. But like most things, it's possible to over-do it. And getting too much exercise can have serious consequences for your body and brain. So, what exactly is \"too much\" exercising?\n\nWell, it depends on factors like your age, health, and choice of workouts. But in general, adults should get around five hours a week of moderate exercise or two and a half hours of more intense activity. Or some combination of the two. That's according to the CDC. But research shows that going way above and beyond that doesn't increase your health benefits.\n\nOne unsurprising study found that light to moderate runners had a lower risk of death than people who didn't exercise. But, in a surprising turn, some people who ran at a faster pace for more than three times a week had a similar risk of dying as the non-runners. So running too much, and too intensely, seems to undo some of the health benefits gained from regular running.\n\nExtreme endurance exercises, like ultra-marathons, may also lead to heart damage, heart rhythm disorders, and enlarged arteries, in some people. Experts believe extreme endurance puts extreme demands on the cardiovascular system. One study found that repeated extreme exercises can \"remodel\" the heart, thickening the muscle's walls and scarring tissue.\n\nAnother study showed that women were less likely to have a heart attack or stroke, if they were physically active at least once a week. But that risk of heart attacks and strokes shot up for women who exercised strenuously every day. So, excessive exercise doesn't provide more benefits than moderate exercise. And it could be more risky.\n\nWomen are at particular risk for what's known as the \"female athlete triad\" that includes: loss of menstruation, osteoporosis or bone mineral loss and eating disorders. These symptoms usually arise from a combination of overexercise and calorie restriction.\n\nFor men, intense exercise has been shown to decrease libido. Possibly due to physical fatigue and lower testosterone levels. For both men and women, overexercise raises the risk of overuse injuries, like tendinitis and stress fractures. These injuries result from repetitive trauma. Your immune system can likewise suffer.\n\nWhile moderate exercise can improve your immune system, excessive exercise can actually suppress it.\n\nThere's up to a 72-hour \"open window\" of impaired immunity after intense exercise. This basically means viruses and bacteria might have an easier time invading and infecting the body. And athletes who overexercised also experienced more upper respiratory tract infections.\n\nSo, we know excessive exercise can wreak havoc on your body \u2014 particularly your heart, tendons, ligaments, and immune system. And for around 1 million people in the US, exercise addiction is wreaking havoc on their brains.\n\nSymptoms of exercise addiction include withdrawal \u2014 that's when you feel anxious or exhausted when you miss a workout. Or feeling a lack of control and unable to cut down on exercise. Even when you know it's hurting you.\n\nNow, it's important to understand that you shouldn't just give up on exercising. The key is to get the right amount.\n\nSo, feel free to go forth and run.

It stops my heart. It's like, oh, it's great,\" Musk told Recode.\n\nWhile Tesla may make an electric bike, it will not make an electric scooter, Musk said. According to Musk, some Tesla employees wanted the automaker to make an electric scooter, but he denied their request.\n\n\"There was some people in the studio who wanted to make a scooter, but I was like, 'Uh, no,'\" Musk said.\n\n\"It lacks dignity,\" he added.\n\nRead Recode's full interview here.\n\nMore from Elon Musk's Recode appearance:\n\nHave a Tesla news tip?

But most economic and trade analysts say it's unlikely that any deal with China is on the horizon.\n\nIsaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at the research and trading firm Compass Point, told Business Insider that the complexity of the issues the US and China are discussing \u2014 intellectual property rights, Chinese laws restricting how US companies can operate in the country, and more \u2014 make a deal difficult.\n\n\"The issues driving the China-US trade tensions are complicated and contentious, which makes it incredibly difficult to believe that substantive progress was made during this phone call,\" Boltansky said.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and Trump has suggested that tariffs could be coming for all other Chinese imports, worth as much as $267 billion, not currently subject to duties.\n\nGiven that tariffs are generally inflationary and bad for economic growth, investors have not been particularly pleased with the idea of a drawn-out trade war \u2014 or the possibility of more tariffs. So talking about ending the battle could help Trump boost the market, which the president has made a key barometer of his success.\n\nRead more: Trump's trade war took a stunning bite out of the US economy, and it's the strongest evidence yet that he's shooting himself in the foot\u00bb\n\n\"We view the positive statements as political cover that could lay the ground work for further tariffs if the G20 meeting is not fruitful/timed for near-term market and political benefit,\" said Ed Mills, a policy analyst at Raymond James. \"Ultimately, actions speak louder than words and all of the actions of the Administration indicate a continued fight, making it harder for a near-term resolution.\"\n\n\"This is pre-election hype designed to make the markets happy; there is no imminent deal with China,\" Greg Valliere, the chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, told Business Insider.\n\nGiving credence to the idea that the thaw in relations may be a short-term stunt are the actions of nearly every other part of Trump's administration. The Department of Justice in recent weeks has indicted multiple Chinese firms for attempted intellectual property theft, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced an initiative to curtail Chinese economic espionage.\n\nAny possibility of a deal would also appear to be news to Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who told CNBC that no deal was imminent during an interview on Friday.\n\n\"There's no massive movement to deal with China,\" he said.\n\nAnd Trump himself has repeatedly said the Chinese were \"not ready\" to make a deal yet and none was likely in the near future.\n\n\"They want to make a deal so badly. And I said, 'You're not ready yet. No, you're not ready. No,'\" Trump said at the White House on October 26. \"I told him, 'You're not ready yet.'\"\n\nGiven the speed of Trump's turnaround, Boltansky said he also believed the sudden surge in Trump's optimism was possibly a political play.\n\n\"At best, the parties are negotiating about negotiating and we are still miles from a deal,\" Boltansky said. \"At worst, this was a maneuver to goose the market a few days before the midterms.\"", "The latest hero to join the cast of \"Overwatch\" is Ashe, the leader of the Deadlock Gang. Ashe was revealed during BlizzCon, Activision-Blizzard's annual fan conference.\n\nShe is the 29th \"Overwatch\" hero and the first damage hero added to the game since \"Doomfist\" arrived in July 2017.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of Ashe's abilities\n\nThe Viper is Ashe's main weapon, a semi-automatic rifle. The gun is capable of quick shots, but does more damage when she aims down the sights.\n\nDynamite explodes in an area after a short delay, dealing damage over time. Ashe can shoot the dynamite to trigger the explosion early.\n\nCoach Gun is a short range shotgun that knocks enemies away and can be used to propel Ashe in different directions.\n\nB.O.B is Ashe's ultimate, calling in an omnic member of her gang for additional fire support.\n\nA new animated short released during BlizzCon shows a bit of Ashe's history with McCree, one of the original \"Overwatch\" heroes. The two gunslingers find themselves in a stand-off over a valuable payload on the familiar Route 66 map.\n\nAshe will be playable on the PC test server before arriving for free on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the coming weeks.", "A federal judge on Friday di missed President Donald Trump's request to stay a lawsuit alleging he's profiting from foreign governments via his Washington, DC, hotel in violation of the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution.\n\nUS District Judge Peter J. Messitte in Greenbelt, Maryland, rejected a request from the Justice Department to put the case on hold in order to allow a higher court to step in. This paves the way for the plaintiffs to gain financial records from Trump's hotel.\n\nThe emoluments clause bars public officials from receiving gifts or cash from foreign or state governments without congressional approval.\n\nTrump has argued the emoluments clause was intended to prevent officials from receiving bribes - not from doing business. The president maintains ownership of his business empire, though he's claimed to avoid day-to-day operations as to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nMessitte in his decision wrote Trump's interpretation of the definition of emolument is \"dubious.\"\n\n\"The President's ownership interest in the Trump International Hotel and his apparent receipt of benefits from at least some foreign and state governments, as well as from the Federal Government itself, suggest that he has received 'emoluments' in violation of the Constitution, giving rise to plausible causes of action against him brought by parties with standing,\" Messitte wrote.\n\nMessitte had already rejected previous attempts from Trump to dismiss the case and has repeatedly concluded the attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia have standing to sue the president on the basis he's accepted payments from foreign government through the Trump International Hotel in the capital.\n\nRead more: A federal judge just ruled against Trump in one of the biggest cases involving his business\n\nAs Business Insider reported in relation to this case in July:\n\nThe attorneys general, Democrats Brian Frosh of Maryland and Karl Racine of Washington, DC, allege that Trump is violating the emoluments clause through his Washington, DC hotel, which engages in business with both foreign and state governments.\n\nThe two attorneys general previously proved they had standing to make such a claim by arguing that businesses within their jurisdictions were losing business as a result of government officials opting to go to Trump's hotel.\n\nFrosh celebrated the Friday's ruling in a tweet: \"The President's latest attempt to block our emoluments lawsuit has failed.\"\n\nSimilarly, Racine tweeted, \"Our case is still moving forward and we will continue to work to stop Pres. Trump from violating the Constitution and profiting from the presidency.\"\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.", "Anthony Davis has the chance to become the NBA's biggest free agent since LeBron James in 2010 and Kevin Durant in 2014.\n\nThe 25-year-old New Orleans Pelicans big man has ascended among the elite NBA players, putting up eye-popping nightly figures over the past five years while becoming a perennial all-star. Nothing has changed for Davis this year, as he's averaging 25 points on 49% shooting, 45% from three, with 13 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 3 blocks per game for the 4-4 Pelicans.\n\nWhile Davis' contract doesn't expire until after the 2019-20 season, chatter has started about where he could land. That's in part because Davis could be in line for the \"supermax\" contract extension this summer, and it's unclear if he'll take it to commit to the Pelicans.\n\nIf he doesn't, the Pelicans may need to begin shopping him, as he could hit free agency and walk.\n\nWhile Davis hasn't given any indications that he wants to leave New Orleans, there have been signs that may concern the Pelicans. Davis recently told Yahoo's Chris Haynes, for instance, that for the Pelicans to win, he has to be nearly perfect.\n\n\"Of course, I know that in order to win games, a lot of pressure is going to be on me,\" Davis said. \"If we lose, it's on me. If we win, they give my team the credit and I'm fine with that ... I don't have a good game and we lose. So, I got to play almost perfect every night to give us a chance to win.\"\n\nIn a league of superteams, it's not a great sign when a player feels he has to do it all to keep his team competitive.\n\nLikewise, this season, Davis signed with Klutch, the agency that represents LeBron James and is run by James' childhood friend Rich Paul. James' Los Angeles Lakers will have cap space this summer and are expected to pursue star players aggressively.\n\nDavis told Haynes that he knew the move would naturally draw speculation.\n\n\"Any time you do anything like that [the noise is coming],\" Davis said. \"'[Paul] represents LeBron, so A.D. is going there,' and all of that. I knew it was coming. That's why it took me a while to do it because I had to get mentally prepared for it. I knew it was coming.\"\n\nMost importantly, the basketball fit might force Davis to move on. The Pelicans have made the playoffs just twice in Davis' career, with last year being the first time they advanced past the first round. Though sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers was an accomplishment, they looked far inferior to the Golden State Warriors, who Davis says the Pelicans are now chasing.\n\nBut the Pelicans have few paths to improve. They're unlikely to land a top draft pick to add talent to play alongside Davis, and they may have a tough time creating the cap space to land another star in free agency. Players like Jrue Holiday, Nikola Mirotic, and Julius Randle who surround Davis now are good players who keep the Pelicans in the playoff race, but realistically, they're not enough to compete for a championship.\n\nDavis will be 27 at the end of the 2019-20 season. If he is still with the Pelicans, and they haven't made major moves to contend for a championship, he may decide to take his talents to a bigger market and a better team.\n\nThe question is where that might be. The Boston Celtics are a frequently mentioned destination because they're close to championship contention and have the assets to trade for Davis. The Lakers are in a somewhat similar position. Haynes reported that teams like the New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers would also monitor the situation in New Orleans.\n\nThe biggest curveball of all will be if the Warriors get involved. It may sound like overkill for the three-time champions to add a player of Davis' caliber, but it's not out of the picture. The Athletic has reported that the Warriors have their eyes on Davis, mainly if Kevin Durant looks likely to leave the team. Davis is the type of game-changing star who could extend their title run as their main stars age into their 30s.\n\nIt's rare for true superstars to hit free agency in their prime, with a real chance at moving elsewhere.

Businesses can get in the action with some top cards for cash back and travel rewards.\n\nThe Ink Business Cash Credit Card from Chase offers a $500 cash-back bonus for new cardholders and up to 5% back on bonus categories.\n\nWith no annual fee, this is a card any small business owner should consider.\n\nEarning rewards with Chase Ink Business Cash\n\nThe Ink Business Cash Credit Card offers a valuable rewards program for cash back or travel rewards. New cardholders start with $500 in bonus cash back after spending $3,000 on new purchases in the first three months after opening a new account. With no annual fee, it is easy to see how this card can pay you.\n\nFor regular purchases, you can earn 5% cash back on up to $25,000 in combined purchases per year at office supply stores and with cable, phone, and internet service providers. Depending on your spending habits, that's worth as much as $1,250 in annual rewards if you hit the maximum $25,000 limit.\n\nThis card offers another bonus, 2% cash back, on the first $25,000 per year in purchases at gas stations and restaurants. That's worth up to $500 per year. Earn 1% on all other purchases with no limit to what you can earn.\n\nGetting more value from your rewards with Chase Ink Business Cash\n\nRegular cardholders may be happy with those cash-back rates, but power users and travel enthusiasts can get even more value from a Chase cash-back credit card when paired with an Ultimate Rewards-earning card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Chase Sapphire Preferred Card.\n\nIf you hold one of these cards, you can transfer your cash-back rewards into your Ultimate Rewards account at a rate of 1 cent = 1 point. But as Chase points are easily worth 2 cents each, your 5% cash back may be worth as much as 10 cents per dollar spent, depending on how you redeem your points.\n\nTo get the best value, transfer points to a linked Chase Ultimate Rewards account. Depending on the card, you can get 1.25 cents or 1.5 cents per point in value when booking flights, hotels, and other travel through the Ultimate Rewards portal.\n\nFor even better value, however, consider transferring points to travel partners like United, Southwest, and Marriott. Using points for premium travel tends to give you the best value per point of any redemption option, and a lot more than you would earn redeeming for cash back.\n\nChase Ink Business Cash benefits\n\nWhen signing up for any new credit card, it is important to review the benefits to see if they have what's most valuable to you. The top benefits today generally include rental car insurance, travel insurance, and purchase protections.\n\nThis card comes with auto rental insurance, travel and emergency assistance (not insurance), and free access to a roadside dispatch service (you pay for services rendered). At the checkout counter, this card offers purchase protection and an automatic extended warranty.\n\nWhile these are not the best benefits out there, they are top-notch for a card with no annual fee.\n\nCosts and fees from the Chase Ink Business Cash\n\nWhile there is no annual fee, there are some potential costs and charges from this card. However, if you always pay on time and in full and avoid some fee-incurring transaction types, you can use this card with no out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe card offers a 12-month introductory period with 0% APR for purchases and balance transfers. After the introductory period ends, the card charges a variable interest rate, from 15.24% to 21.24% based on your credit history. Rates can change at any time with market rates. Cash-advance transactions charge a higher 26.99% variable APR. Don't miss a payment, or you'll get hit with a higher 29.99% penalty APR.\n\nBalance transfers charge 5% of the transaction value ($5 minimum) and cash advances cost the same 5%, though with a higher $15 minimum. Foreign transactions incur a 3% fee. Late and returned payments cost up to $39 each.\n\nIs Chase Ink Business Cash right for your business?\n\nWhile cards like the Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express OPEN offer even more valuable rewards and benefits, the high annual fee of $450 might scare you off. Ink Business Cash offers the right balance between low fees and high rewards that it emerges as a top card for small business owners.", "At the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said his 11-year-old son was using the family's home PC to mine ether.\n\nPichai had been asked about how he thinks about screen time for his children.

So we set up an Ethereum miner on there, and we've made a few pennies, a few dollars since.\"\n\nThe interview with Pichai came on the same day as thousands of Google employees around the world walked out in protest of the company's handling of sexual-misconduct allegations.\n\n\"This anger and frustration within the company, we all feel it,\" Pichai said when asked about the protests. \"I feel it too.\"", "Elon Musk and his rocket company, SpaceX, want to send people to the surface of Mars and eventually colonize the red planet.\n\nToday that goal seems much closer to reality than when Musk founded SpaceX in 2002.

The breach would reportedly lead to dozens of deaths around the globe and a cascade of consequences that spanned years.\n\n'It was working well for too long'\n\nFormer officials say they believe the breach originated with an Iranian double agent that was hired by the CIA \u2014 what they claim would be a result of lax vetting. Despite a warning from Israel that Iran had identified certain CIA assets, Iran was then able to penetrate a CIA communications system through a series of Google searches.\n\nAccording to one former official, the Iranian double agent showed Iranian intelligence the website that the CIA was using for their communications. By using Boolean search operators like \"AND\" and \"OR\", stringing together characteristics of the communications and websites, Iranian intelligence was reportedly able to locate multiple other websites that the CIA was using for its communications. From there, Iran could track who was visiting the sites and from where \u2014 eventually exposing a large swath of the CIA's network in Iran.\n\n'There was a cascade of effects that flowed outward'\n\nThe consequences of the breach were large and catastrophic.

Obama, who is due to campaign for African-American gubernatorial candidates in two Southern states, has decried the \"politics of division.\"\n\nObama appears first, in Miami with gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who faces former congressman Ron DeSantis, a strong Trump backer, and U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, who is being challenged by the outgoing governor, Rick Scott. A Reuters/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics poll this week showed both Democrats leading with voter enthusiasm for Gillum, the young and liberal Tallahassee mayor, appearing to help Nelson and other Democratic candidates on the ballot.\n\nTrump is set to back Republican challengers to incumbent Democratic U.S. senators in West Virginia and Indiana, states he won in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOpinion polls and non-partisan forecasters generally show Democrats as having strong chances of winning 23 additional seats and taking a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, which they could use to launch investigations into Trump's administration and block his legislative agenda.\n\nRepublicans are generally expected to retain control of the U.S. Senate, whose powers include confirming Trump's nominations to lifetime seats on the Supreme Court.\n\nInterest in the vote has been unusually high for a year when Congress but not the White House is at stake, according to early voting tallies. More than 27 states have recorded more early votes at this point in the campaign than they did in all of 2014, according to The Election Project at the University of Florida, which tracks early turnout.\n\nTexas had already recorded more votes than it did in all of 2014, including Election Day, the group said.\n\nAfter Miami, Obama will head to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator aiming to become the United State's first black female governor.\n\nObama's challenge will be motivating the diverse coalition of voters who elected him in 2008 and 2012 but failed to turn out in as large numbers in 2016, said Patrick Hickey, a professor of political science at West Virginia University.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton lost because the Obama coalition didn't show up at the polls - he's trying to mobilize folks who like him and trust him in Georgia and Florida,\" Hickey said.\n\nIn West Virginia, Trump will campaign for a third time with Patrick Morrisey, who aims to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.\n\nTwo new polls this week showed Manchin's once-comfortable lead over Morrisey dwindling to 5 percentage points, which the Democrat's supporters blame in part on Trump's repeated visits.\n\n\"I know Trump coming so often is making an impact,\" said Jim Hoyt, chairman of the Morgan County Democratic Party in northeast West Virginia. Like other Democrats in the state, he still expects Manchin to win.\n\nTrump also will go to Indiana to appear on behalf of Mike Braun, who is trying to replace Joe Donnelly in the Senate.\n\nFor all Reuters election coverage, click: https://www.reuters.com/politics/election2018\n\n(Reporting by Joe Skipper in Miami and Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, California, additional reporting by Amy Tennery in New York; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Bill Trott)", "When Gen. Stanley McChrystal began working on his memoir after retiring as a four-star general in 2010, he realized that his perception of himself as a leader was different from reality. In the past eight years, he's had time to reflect on his career and the notion of leadership itself.\n\nDuring that long career, McChrystal led America and its allies in the Afghanistan War before retiring as a four-star general in 2010. He revolutionized the Joint Special Operations Command. And he's best known for taking out the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nHe's now the managing partner of the leadership-consulting firm the McChrystal Group, and he's the lead author of \"Leaders: Myth and Reality.\"\n\nIn an interview for Business Insider's podcast \"This Is Success,\" he breaks down what he learned from key points in his life, including how recently revisiting the legacy of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee helped him realize it was time to redefine leadership.\n\nListen to the full episode here:\n\nSubscribe to \"This is Success\" on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, or your favorite podcast app. Check out previous episodes with:\n\nTranscript edited for clarity.\n\nStanley McChrystal: By the time we finished this book, we really arrived at this conclusion that leadership isn't what we think it is, and it never has been. It's much more complex. It's not two-dimensional. And for me, one of the representative incidents is my relationship with Robert E. Lee. I grew up, figuratively speaking, with Robert E. Lee.\n\nRich Feloni: You grew up in Virginia.\n\nMcChrystal: I grew up in Northern Virginia, not far from his boyhood home, and I went to Washington-Lee High School. And when I turned 17, I went to West Point, as Robert E. Lee had done, and when you go to West Point, you don't escape Robert E. Lee. I lived in Lee Barracks. There were paintings of Robert E. Lee. And while every other leader at West Point is famous, he's special.\n\nWhen McChrystal attended West Point in the '70s, Confederate general Robert E. Lee had transcended his connection to the Confederate cause, and had become a symbol of military discipline and honor. The Library of Congress\n\nAnd then when I got older and I was retired and I had this picture that my wife had given me 40 years before. My wife had paid $25 for it when I was a second lieutenant, and I hung it proudly at every set of quarters we ever had, because for me it represented \"This is what I believe in.\" When someone came into my quarters, they'd see, \"Oh, Robert E. Lee. Those are the values that he believes in.\" And I was proud of that.\n\nThen, after Charlottesville, in late spring of 2017, my wife, Annie \u2014 we'd been married 40 years at the time \u2014 she goes, \"I think you ought to get rid of that picture.\" And my first response was, \"You gave it to me, honey. I could never get rid of that?\" And she says, \"No.\" And I said, \"Well, why?\" And she says, \"I think it's communicating something you don't think it is.\" And I said, \"What do you mean? He was a general officer. He just did his thing. He was a military guy, not a politician or something.\" She said, \"You may think that, but people in our home may not think that, and they may think you're trying to communicate something deeper, white supremacy and all those things. So one morning, I took it down and literally threw it away. And it was a pretty emotional moment for me.\n\nAnd then as we started writing this book, and we had already begun the initial work, I realized I couldn't write a book about leadership unless I wrote about Robert E. Lee. And I knew that was dangerous, because Robert E. Lee had become a controversial character. There's a part of American society that is just passionate in his defense, part of it that is passionate against him, and everybody's going to weigh in. But you know, I'd grown up with Robert E. Lee, both as a person in my mind, but also as an ideal. And just recently, I walked down, just to walk the distance between his childhood home and the slave-trading house in Alexandria, Virginia, which was the second-busiest slave-trading house in the United States. And this is where northern African-Americans were bought. Some freed men were captured, but others were bought from farms that weren't profitable and shipped to the deep South, where cotton was so profitable. And so it was right in front of him. It was 10 blocks from his home. You don't hide from the fact that this very ugly thing is a reality. And he spent the next four years defending it. And so there's this contradiction. Here's a guy who in some ways, is so admirable. His soldiers loved him\n\nMcChrystal coauthored \"Leaders\" with Jeff Eggers, the head of the McChrystal Group's Leadership Institute, and Jason Mangone, the director of the Franklin Project at the Aspen Institute. portfolio Feloni: From a military perspective.\n\nMcChrystal: Exactly.\n\nFeloni: Yeah, but it would have to be removing from the context of basically a traitor to his country, ignoring that and kind of replacing it with a myth.\n\nMcChrystal: That's right, and I couldn't.\n\nFeloni: And were you not aware of that link that people could make when you had that painting in your quarters?\n\nMcChrystal: Here's the point. On one level, yes I was. On another level, what I did was I just said, \"Yeah, but.\" And I think a lot of people, with Robert E. Lee, go, \"Yeah, but.\" And the real point of the book is, everybody is a complex person like that. Every memory of every leader that we profiled and everyone we could think, may not have that clear a contradiction, but they all have them. And we as followers, we as observers, we have to make a decision on how we look at those, how we process that, because if we're looking for the perfect person, woman or man, we can wait forever. They're not coming.\n\nThe 'Great Man Theory' of leadership is a myth\n\nFeloni: Yeah. Well, when you're looking at that and kind of leading into your thesis here, what is the way that we define leaders and leadership, and what is wrong with that, and what were you looking to correct?\n\nMcChrystal: I wrote my memoirs starting in 2010, and I thought that it would be fairly straightforward, because I was there, so I knew what happened. And I'd be the star of the show. The spotlight would be on me. And yet, when we went to do ... I had a young person helping me that was brilliant. We went to do the research. We did a whole bunch of interviews, and we went to things that I had been very much a part of and given credit for. We found that I would make a decision and issue some order and there would be an outcome. And I thought, \"OK, my order produced that outcome.\" And in reality, we found that there's a myriad of actions that other people are doing, or factors impinging on it, that actually affected the outcome much more than I did.\n\nFeloni: So you didn't realize this until you were writing your memoirs?\n\nMcChrystal: No, I mean, you get to this point in life because you sort of believe the Great Man Theory. You sort of believe that the leader is central to everything. And then when I get this, it's very humbling, and I realize, leaders matter, just not like we think they do. And as we put in the book, it's also the way we study leadership. We study biographies, which puts the person at the center. And so the spotlight tends to stay on them, and everything else tends to be a bit in shadows. You very rarely see a statue of a team. You see a few, but usually there's a person on the pedestal. But in reality, a team, and sometimes a very large team, made it happen or didn't make it happen. And yet, it's hard to explain that.\n\nFeloni: In this book, you picked a very interesting collection of profiles, and you even included the al-Qaeda leader that you defeated in Iraq, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi. So what can you learn about leadership from studying someone that you morally oppose, even on an extreme example. This was your enemy. What do you gain from studying that?\n\nMcChrystal: Well, we didn't just oppose him \u2014 we killed him.\n\nFeloni: Yeah.\n\nAs the head of Joint Special Operations Command, McChrystal hunted down and assassinated al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. McChrystal got inside Zarqawi's head during the hunt. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi#mediaviewer/File:Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi_%281966-2006%29.jpg\n\nMcChrystal: I stood over his body right after we killed him. So for about two and a half years, we fought a bitter fight against this guy. And Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had come from a tough town in Jordan, very little education, got involved in crime and things like that in his youth. But then what happened was he realized that if he showed self-discipline to exhibit the conviction of his Islamic beliefs, if he did that overtly, if he became a zealot other people were attracted to him. He was living up to what he said and was demanding that they do. Later, when he became the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, he led the same way; he wore all black, looked like a terrorist leader. He actually killed himself \u2014 he was the person who held the knife when they beheaded Nicholas Berg. A gruesome thing to do, but what he's showing people is our cause is so important, I'm willing to do something that we all know is horrific. And so he would lead around the battlefield courageously. And so what he did was he was able to bring forth people to follow his very extreme part of Islam, when most of them really didn't. The Iraqi Sunni population were not naturally adherents to al-Qaeda, but he was able to produce such a sense of leadership and zealous beliefs that they followed. He became the godfather of ISIS.\n\nFeloni: Yeah, and so by looking at this was, are you saying that to benefit your own leadership you had to get in the mind of him and understand that?\n\nMcChrystal: Well, the first thing you have to do is understand him. Your first desire is to demonize him, but the reality is, I had to respect him. He led very effectively, very, and if you really get down and put the lens another way, he believed and he fought for what he believed in. And who's to say we were right and he was wrong?\n\nFeloni: And that was something that you were thinking when you were in Iraq?\n\nMcChrystal: Not initially. Initially, you just say, \"We're just gonna get this guy.\" And then after a while you watch him lead and you realize not only is he a worthy opponent \u2014 he's making me better \u2014 but you're also going after someone who truly believes. Who do you want to hang out with, who do you want to go to dinner with? You want somebody who believes what they're doing. Now, his techniques I didn't agree with. In many ways he was a psychopath. But I know a lot of people for whom I have less respect than I do for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nFeloni: Interesting. When you were having the collection of people in this book, what were you looking for? Because in some ways you were saying that taking a look at profiles of individuals is the opposite of what you wanted to do. Because if you elevate someone above the context that they're in, it's counterproductive, but you're proving that through elevating people so how do you navigate that?\n\nMcChrystal: Yeah, that's an absolutely great point, and we actually didn't realize that at the beginning of the book. We started writing and we said, \"Hey, we are almost running in absolutely opposite directions of what we're proposing.\" You can write a theoretical book on leadership, and there will be a small community of people who read it. We learn through stories, all of us do, and we learn through stories of people. We picked these 13 diverse people and we had these six genres, we had founders, we had geniuses, we had power brokers, we had Coco Chanel, we had Boss Tweed, we have Martin Luther, we have Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we have Harriet Tubman. We wanted something that would be universal, give us a wide look at different kinds of leaders and context. We wanted diversity in sex, we wanted diversity in nationality, we have a Chinese admiral from the 15th century. And so we thought that if you could bring it wide like that you can draw the universal lessons out, that we couldn't do if we just took politicians or soldiers or something.\n\nLessons from success and failure in war\n\nFeloni: Yeah, now I want to talk about these lessons with the lens of your career as well. You became known for the approach that you took to join Special Operations Command, re-imaging the approach to Special Operations, particularly in Iraq, which led to the death of Zarqawi. And so when you had such transformations at JSOC, what was that like coming into a role where you had to adapt on the fly but every change, every risk that you took had lives in the balance?\n\nMcChrystal: Well, it was frightening, but it was very, very important. I had grown up essentially in joint Special Operations Command and the Rangers and then on the staff. I was very familiar with this very elite counterterrorist force. And this force was, you've seen it in movies, bearded guys with big knuckles and fancy weapons and these surly arrogant attitudes and that's pretty accurate but the hearts of lions. But we very insular, we were designed to do counter-hijacking, hostage rescue, precise raids, and so we were almost in an insular part of the military and no one else interacted much with us. We would be directed to do certain missions and we loved that because we didn't have to be affected by the big military bureaucracy. And then in Iraq what happened is, starting in 2003, really after the invasion, we ran into a problem that was bigger and more complex than we'd ever faced before, and that was al-Qaeda in Iraq. And we found that very narrow insulated way of operating before, tribal way, it didn't work because you had to have this synergy of a real team and at first we almost were in denial because we're so good at what we do.\n\nWe said, \"Well, we'll just do what we do and everybody else will figure everything else out.\" But that wasn't going to work. Really starting in early 2004 we came to a collective understanding that we were losing, and we were likely to lose if we didn't change. Now we had no idea how to change, there wasn't a road map, I wasn't the visionary leader to provide that. And so what we said was, \"Well, we will do anything but this. Now we'll change.\" And because I didn't have this vision or clear blueprint to put in front of the organization, I essentially put it out to the team. I said, \"We're going to start changing to whatever works, so what we do that works we'll do more of, what we do that doesn't work we'll stop.\" And that freed the organization to constantly adapt. We're able to modify, adapt ourselves and constantly change without the limitations of a doctrine that says, \"You can't do that.\"\n\nMcChrystal was known for being unusually close to the action for a four-star general. Paula Bronstein/Getty\n\nOur doctrine became, \"If it's stupid and it works, it ain't stupid and we'll push it.\" And as it came it started to change the way we thought about leadership. When I took over I was approving every mission because I'm the commander and I found there's no way you can be fast enough, so my role changed. I went from being the micro-manager, the centralized director, to being a commander who creates this ecosystem in which this group of really talented people figure it out. And my goal was to keep the ecosystem going, grow it with new participants and keep everyone supported and inspired.\n\nFeloni: When you're saying that when you had to take big risks with these changes, that there was a level of fear involved. Were you mitigating that fear by learning to trust the people that you were working with?\n\nMcChrystal: Yeah, and you have to \u2014 sometimes you can't completely mitigate it. In an organization like JSOC, when you take casualties it's deeply emotional because it's not like new privates coming in, you get a new private. It takes about a decade to build an operator, everybody's the godparent of other operator's kids, you know. And so when you lose people, you lose people who've been around a long time, it took a long time, so it's very emotional. T.E. Lawrence talked about the ripples in a pond.\n\nFeloni: That's \"Lawrence of Arabia.\"\n\nMcChrystal: That's right, \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" He talked about when you lost one of the better ones, it was like ripples because it went out into their families and whatnot. Every casualty was much more costly and therefore you had to try to minimize them. And so as we went into this risk period there was a lot of uncertainty and I couldn't, I don't have the wisdom or courage or any of that to bear all that together, so we had a team and we supported each other.\n\nFeloni: Distribute that.\n\nMcChrystal: Yeah, exactly.\n\nFeloni: Yeah, and in terms of looking at something continuing after you leave, so you led the US-led coalition in the war in Afghanistan. That was eight years ago when you left; the war is still going. How does that look to you, because, for example, I could speak to a CEO who left a company and they can comment and be, like, \"Oh, here's what worked and what didn't.\" But as we were talking about, the stakes are just so much different in war. How do you process that?\n\nMcChrystal: You can process it in a lot of ways. You could take a strict business sense you could say, \"Well, it hasn't succeeded thus far, so it's a bad investment.\" And then I can also look and see that as of 2001 when we entered Afghanistan there were no females in school under the Taliban. There weren't that many young males in school and now we've had almost 17 years of young ladies going to school, young men and so we've got a different young generation in Afghanistan. And 4.4 million Afghans voted this week and it wasn't a presidential election. Is the glass half full, is it half empty, is there a hole in it? The answer is yes to all of those. There's deep corruption, there's huge problems inside the country, but in many ways I think that rather than say, \"OK, it's a failure,\" I'd say it's a complex problem, one of which you work on over a long period. I know I would not subscribe now to thousands of American troops or unlimited amounts of money, but I wouldn't recommend walking away. I think our partnership with the Afghan people and the signal we send to other countries in the region is important. And if we think about the world as a completely connected place now, not just by information technology but culturally, I think the ability to have relationships, to demonstrate our willingness to be a part of things is more important than ever. It was critical really right after the Second World War, we gave both Asia through Japan and Europe enough cohesion to grow back. It doesn't feel as easy or as good in Afghanistan but I would tell you, I look at the world through that lens is how I come at it.\n\nFeloni: In \"Leaders,\" your memoir, it's giving you a chance to be introspective of your own career. And on the nature of leaving the military when it came in this much publicized, there was a Rolling Stone article that reporter Michael Hastings portrayed you as a renegade general and that ended up leaving your position. How do you process that now, looking back at your role since it's been eight years?\n\nMcChrystal: Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of ways that maybe I could or should. The first thing is it happened, and I didn't think that the article was truly reflective of my team. It was about me and my team and the runaway general and that is obviously not a good title. And so on the one hand I thought that that wasn't fair; on the other hand I'm responsible and we have this negative article about a senior general shows up on the president of the United States' desk. And it's my job not to put articles like that on the president's desk, so I offered my resignation. President Obama accepted it, and I don't have any problem with it because I'm responsible whether I did something wrong or not. I'm responsible, and as I told the president that day, \"I'm happy to stay in command or resign, whatever is best for the mission.\"\n\nNow that's phase one, and I feel very good about that decision. I'm not happy it happened, but I feel good about that. Then you have a moment when you have a failure like that in your life and you get to make a decision. You're either going to relitigate that for the rest of your life and I could be a retired bitter general, I could be whatever, the CEO got fired or whatever or not. And my wife helped me through this more than anything, because as I tell people, \"She lives like she drives, without using the rear-view mirror.\" And so we made the decision, she helped me. \"We're going to focus completely on the future.\" We made the decision, she helped me. \"We're going to focus completely on the future. There is no point in being bitter because nobody cares but you.\" So I decided to look forward, I decided to think about, \"What can I do now?\" Now, that's easier said than done. Every day there's some hurt.\n\nFeloni: Even now?\n\nMcChrystal: Occasionally. Not every day, but occasionally something will come up. Last week, Rolling Stone queried if I wanted to do another interview. The answer was no.\n\nFeloni: That seems like ... yeah.\n\nMcChrystal: Yeah. I kind of went, \"Really?\" But the reality is, it always kind of comes back up, and you have to remake that decision on a constant basis. But it gets easier over time because you start to see how healthy that is. I would argue that every one or your listeners is going to fail. They're going to fail in a marriage, they're going to fail in a business, they're going to fail at something for which they are responsible. And they've got to make the decision, \"OK, what's the rest of your life going to be like?\" Because you can't change what's already happened. The only thing you can change is what happens in the future. So I tell people, \"For God's sakes, don't screw up the rest of your life because of something that happened there.\" And if you make the right decision, to lean forward, I've been extraordinarily satisfied and happy with that.\n\nMcChrystal in Afghanistan. U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Francisco V. Govea II via Wikimedia Commons\n\nFeloni: And if you were to write a biographical profile for yourself in \"Leaders,\" what would the theme of your leadership style be, and what would be the reality versus the myth of it?\n\nMcChrystal: It would be evolution. One of the things we see in some of these leaders is they didn't evolve. Walt Disney was this extraordinary animator, and with a small team he was exceptional. When the team got big, he didn't adapt well, and his brother basically had to run it, and he focused on projects. Mine was a journey ... I was a very different leader as a lieutenant colonel than I was as a company commander captain. I was very centralized when I was young. I started to loosen up, by the time I was a general officer I was, I think, completely different. I was much more decentralized. So I think the theme of a profile of me would be the evolution of that.\n\nNow, the myth is the opposite; the myth is the counterterrorist leader who killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. I went out, wrestled him to the ground, buried to the waist, and that's total B.S. At times do I like the myth because people go, \"Wow, look at him!\"? Yeah, it's kind of cool, you never want to go, \"No, that's not true.\" But it's not true. The reality is that I built a team. Ultimately I'm more proud of enabling the team that I would be of wrestling to his death. But it still feels kind of cool when people say that. [laughs]\n\nFeloni: So it's the evolution of you as someone who is a very centralized commander to decentralizing.\n\nMcChrystal: Yeah, and thinking about it entirely differently.\n\nApplying these lessons to the workplace\n\nFeloni: And we've been talking about leadership on a grand scale, but you're also the head of the McChrystal Group, which works with businesses on leadership development. So after having worked with a bunch of different industries, often on much smaller scales, what would you say are some of the most common mistakes a new leader makes?\n\nMcChrystal: I think often a new leader comes in and wants to prove themselves, because they've been hired, typically they've been given a role and a fair amount of money, and so they think they've got to prove themselves. There's a reticence to say, \"I don't know.\" There's a reticence to look at the team and say \"What should we do?\" and to have the team do it. Because you're worried about your own credibility. I think leaders actually, if they're willing to, I'm not saying take a subordinate role, they're responsible, but take a much more inclusive role, a much more role in which you ask people to help lead, actually works much better. Some of the best I've ever seen that have particularly been in jobs awhile have reached that, and it's magic to see.\n\nFeloni: And on the flip side of that, should people who are followers, should they see leadership in a new light, maybe their relationship to their boss, their boss' boss?\n\nMcChrystal: Yeah, think about it \u2014 how many times have we sat back and you've got either a new leader or your leader in the auditorium, in the room, and they're saying, \"OK, here's what we're going to do,\" and you're sitting back kind of the smart-ass, going, \"This is stupid, that won't work, boom, boom, boom.\" Rear up on your hind legs and bark, and maybe we'll think about doing it. Leaders have a role, but the followers have a huge role, huge responsibility. Huge responsibility in doing their part, but also shaping the leader. You see the leader making a mistake and you don't say something to them? You fail in your job. And then when you see them fail and you get smug and you go, \"Yeah, I thought that she was never that good, he was never that good,\" shame on you. Because you own part of that, and in reality when it's firing time they had to fire all of you.\n\nFeloni: So not only should we not put figures of the past on pedestals. We shouldn't do that with our own bosses.\n\nMcChrystal: Absolutely, and bosses shouldn't put themselves on pedestals either. There are a few who keep wanting to step up there, and then ... I think it's much better for the leader to stay away from the pedestal.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said McChrystal was \"perhaps the finest warrior and leader of men in combat I've ever met.\" Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images\n\nFeloni: And at this point, how do you personally define success?\n\nMcChrystal: It's the team I'm part of. I've got this company that's now 100 people, it's grown, and I'm not critical to the business, except my name's on the door. I show up occasionally, and they're very nice to me and whatnot, but the reality is the work gets done by the team, and I take the greatest pride in the world when I sit in one of our meetings and I'm not saying much, and it's happening. They're just doing things, they're pulling, they're saying we're going to go in this direction, and nobody looks to me to say, \"Can we go in that direction or should we?\" And they're not being discourteous. They know that that's not the best thing to do. If they turn to me or somebody else to let the old gray beard do it, it's too slow. It's often not the right answer. So I am really happiest when I see that, and it gives you great pride.\n\nFeloni: So success to you, would it be having a non-integral role among your team?\n\nMcChrystal: No \u2014 I want to be integral to it, I want to feel like a part of it, but I don't want to feel like the critical cog. I don't want to feel like the keystone to the arch. I want the company, the organization, to be confident in themselves. If I got hit by a car, they'd say, \"We're going to miss Stan, but guess what? In his honor, we're going to move forward and we are going to do X, X, X.\" That's when I really feel best about things. Or they don't even tell me about things they're doing, and suddenly we're doing very well on a project and I hear about it, and I go, \"Wow, that's good \u2014 when did we do that?\" They say so and so, I say, \"Well, why didn't I know?\" They say, \"Well, you didn't need to know. It's not important.\" And they're right.\n\nFeloni: Is there a piece of advice that you would give to someone who wants to have a career like yours? It doesn't necessarily have to be military \u2014 it could be a sense of leadership.\n\nMcChrystal: When I think about the two things that I hope leaders have, first is empathy. Understanding that if you're sitting on the other side of the table you have a different perspective, and they might be right. So just being able to put yourself in their shoes. Doesn't mean you agree with them, doesn't mean you approve, but being able to see it is really important. And then the second part is self-discipline. Because most of us know what we ought to do as leaders. We know what we shouldn't do. It's having the self-discipline to do those things, because you're leading all the time. You're leading by example all the time \u2014 it's a good example or a bad example. It's not just the leadership in your job; it's an extraordinary responsibility. I had a battalion commander whose battalion I joined, and he had just left when I got there. But all the lieutenants are wearing their T-shirts backwards. And I'm going, \"All right, what's going on here? Did they get up after drinking all night or something?\" And the battalion commander had done that because it showed less skin when you're out there in the field and the enemy couldn't see the white skin and shoot you. I didn't think that was that smart an idea, but the fact that just because he wore his T-shirts backwards, his whole cohort of young lieutenants was doing it.\n\nFeloni: He didn't tell them to.\n\nMcChrystal: I don't think he told them to. I got there right after he'd left, so it was kind of like this clinical thing. I got there ' \"Why have they got their T-shirts backwards?\" And this guy had done that. Just the power you find that if you are charismatic and whatnot, anything you do, how you treat people, how you think about things, the little things, you'll start to see it mimicked by people through your organization, and there's great power in that. And you've got to be careful with it.\n\nFeloni: Thank you, general.\n\nMcChrystal: It's been my honor. Thank you.", "Tesla CEO Elon Musk participated in a lengthy Recode/Decode podcast interview with Kara Swisher this week. In over an hour, he covered a lot of ground. It's worth a listen.\n\nI got through the whole thing, hearing all about how painful it was for Musk to work the 100-plus-hour weeks that were required to address the numerous problems with the fraught ramp-up for production of Tesla's Model 3 sedan.\n\nI shared Musk's pain \u2014 because, honestly, it's agonizing to listen to him endlessly repeat the same tales of woe about how difficult it is to assemble an automobile while working with modern supply chains. I feel as if he's hit this talking point dozens of times at this juncture. He typically notes that whatever slowdown develops in Tesla's manufacturing process can be blamed on the company's most sluggish supplier.\n\nThat's certainly true, but it isn't anything new. Swisher didn't press him on this, and I didn't expect her to. She probably doesn't have a detailed understanding of the auto industry, and she doesn't need to. She's a technology journalist. But she could certainly say something like, \"Great, sounds like a challenge \u2014 but isn't everybody else who makes cars also grappling with this? Or not.\"\n\nShe was just the lastest audience for this Muskian lecture. Don't get me wrong; Musk's lectures can be fascinating and important. They have genuine value. But his \"Carmaking 101\" spiel often gets trotted out for the more seasoned automotive media and for investment-bank analysts who have spent years covering major global automakers that wrestle with supply-chain management every single day.\n\nMusk is telling us something that everybody already knows\n\nTesla's factory. Tesla\n\nThe bottom line is that when Musk launches into this lecture, my reaction has generally been to ask, \"Why are you being so strenuous in telling me something I already know?\" It would be like if I spent 10 minutes informing him that gravity is a fundamental consideration in the design of rockets intended to deliver payloads to orbit.\n\nThe way that cars are now built is the result of widespread adoption of something called the Toyota Production System, developed by Toyota in the 1970s and 1980s. (Musk, by the way, has critiqued TPS, not without justification.) Essentially, TPS strived for \"just in time\" inventory management: a part is supposed to arrive at the vehicle-assembly point at the moment it's needed. Deft supply-chain management means that large and costly inventories don't have to be stockpiled.\n\nEverybody in the car business is aware of this. It's a given. In fact, nobody except Musk ever talks about it. In more than a decade of covering the auto industry, I've enjoyed a few conversations with experts in \"lean manufacturing,\" but supply chain is a background thing, the endless low hum of machine running around the globe.\n\nRead more: Tesla isn't disrupting the auto industry, according to the expert who created the theory of disruptive innovation\n\nSerious issues do arise every so often. Ford had to dial back some crucial F-150 pickup-truck production this year due to a fire at a supplier. A number of carmakers have had to deal with the massive recall of airbags manufactured by Takata. And after the 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan, Toyota and Honda saw their supply chain disrupted for months.\n\nWhy does Musk keep coming back to this?\n\nMisdirection or distraction? Mark Brake/Getty Images\n\nSo why does Musk so frequently revisit this rap?\n\nPart of it is because Tesla hasn't always had access to the best suppliers, nor the top teams at supplier. That was simply a consequence of Tesla's scale. The situation has improved.\n\nYou might suggest that Musk is engaged in misdirection or blame-shifting. But I don't think he is. Rather, I think he dislikes expressing severe frustration and uses various flavors of lecture-y wonk speak as a way to avoid it. He adores technical detail. It calms him down.\n\nShould I begrudge Musk his coping mechanism? No. But it's getting a bit old, and what Musk likes to call \"production hell\" is starting to look like something Tesla is having a hard time either avoiding or learning from. It's actually important that Tesla improve its ability to make cars, so that it can address impressive demand for its vehicles and achieve Musk's objective of accelerating sustainable transportation.\n\nSo it doesn't entirely matter if the lecture about supply chains is actually misdirection. It's turned into an annoyance at best and a distraction at worst.", "Truck transportation is a $1.45 trillion industry worldwide.

The Reaper is one of America's top hunter-killer drones and a key weapon that can stalk and strike militants in the war on terror.\n\nThe CH-5 \"can perform whatever operations the MQ-9 Reaper can and is even better than the US vehicle when it comes to flight duration and operational efficiency,\" Shi Wen, a chief CH series drone designer at the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics, told the China Daily two years ago.\n\nBut, while the CH-5 and the MQ-9 may look a lot alike, it is technological similarity, not parity. The Reaper's payload, for instance, is roughly double that of China's CH-5. And, while China's drone may excel in endurance, its American counterpart has a greater maximum take-off weight and a much higher service ceiling.\n\nThe sensors and communications equipment on the Chinese drone are also suspected to be inferior to those on the MQ-9, which last year achieved the ability to not only wipe out ground targets but eliminate air assets as well.\n\nNonetheless, these systems can get the job done. The CH-4, the predecessor to the latest CH series drone, has been deployed in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nChina has exported numerous drones to countries across the Middle East, presenting them as comparable to US products with less restrictions and for a lower price.", "Former intelligence officials have revealed a previously unreported breach of a CIA communications system by Iran.\n\nYahoo News reported that in a breach that occurred around 2010, Iranian agents used simple Google searches to identify and then infiltrate the websites that the CIA was using to communicate with agents, according to two former US intelligence officials. The breach would reportedly lead to dozens of deaths around the globe and a cascade of consequences that spanned years.\n\n'It was working well for too long'\n\nFormer officials say they believe the breach originated with an Iranian double agent that was hired by the CIA \u2014 what they claim would be a result of lax vetting. Despite a warning from Israel that Iran had identified certain CIA assets, Iran was then able to penetrate a CIA communications system through a series of Google searches.\n\nAccording to one former official, the Iranian double agent showed Iranian intelligence the website that the CIA was using for their communications. By using Boolean search operators like \"AND\" and \"OR\", stringing together characteristics of the communications and websites, Iranian intelligence was reportedly able to locate multiple other websites that the CIA was using for its communications. From there, Iran could track who was visiting the sites and from where \u2014 eventually exposing a large swath of the CIA's network in Iran.\n\n'There was a cascade of effects that flowed outward'\n\nThe consequences of the breach were large and catastrophic. In Iran, multiple informants were imprisoned and executed and the network was reportedly nearly destroyed.\n\nUS officials reportedly believe that through information sharing, the breach also led to China's penetration of the CIA network in that country, which in 2011 and 2012 led to the execution of approximately 30 agents there.\n\nIn 2013, Iran reportedly penetrated the CIA's communications system in Yemen \"that had nothing to do with them.\" To agents, the breach in Yemen indicated a desire to use the information they had gathered offensively.\n\n'CIA is aware of this'\n\nThe breach itself is disturbing enough when considering the stakes of America's most tightly held secrets, but perhaps even more shocking than the breach itself is the fact that the CIA was warned.\n\nIn 2008, defense contractor John Reidy, who worked with Iranian sources, blew the whistle on a \"massive intelligence failure\" in the CIA, and in 2010 said the \"nightmare scenario\" had occurred, Yahoo reported. Reidy was moved off his assignment and eventually fired.\n\nReidy claims that \"upwards of 70 percent of our operations had been compromised.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Iran has been a notable alleged perpetrator of high-profile hacks and cyber attacks. In March, a US grand jury indicted nine Iranians for allegedly hacking the computers of 7,998 professors at 320 universities. Numerous cyberattacks on Saudi Arabian oil have been attributed to Iran, including one that is thought to have been devised to trigger an explosion.", "Tiffany Haddish says that she once asked her celebrity crushes, Michael B.

It contained far more facts and information than is required to prosecute the case.\n\nIt goes into painstaking detail, describing point-by-point how the alleged hackers targeted and successfully obtained emails and records from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, falsified their identities, and laundered money via cryptocurrency networks to carry out their scheme.\n\nThe special counsel employed the same tactic when he indicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates last year.\n\nPaul Manafort.

It would be an unlawful order.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n'A wasteful deployment'\n\nTrump's decision to deploy troops to the border has also faced backlash. Critics have described it as a political stunt, though Defense Secretary Jim Mattis rejected this characterization.\n\nBut retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday described Trump's decision as \"wasteful.\" He also seemed to condemn Trump's remarks on shooting rock-throwing migrants by stating the situation would be made \"much worse\" if troops use disproportionate force.\n\nRead more: Trump says 'I hope not' when asked if US troops will shoot at migrant caravan headed to border\n\n\"Our men and women in uniform are better trained, better equipped, and better led so they meet any threat with confidence,\" Dempsey said in a tweet. \"A wasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines would be made much worse if they use force disproportional to the threat they face. They won't.\"\n\nOver 7,000 US troops will reportedly be involved in the operation at the border, though Trump earlier this week suggested that number could rise to as many as 15,000.", "As the November midterms come around the corner, Democrats have gone from being optimistic to confident that they will take the House of Representatives.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi said as much when she appeared on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" earlier this week.\n\n\"Up until today, I would've said, 'If the election were held today, we would win,'\" she told the host. \"What now I'm saying is, 'We will win.'\"\n\nAs Democrats gear up to regain control of the House, it has stirred speculation about whether the party will move to impeach President Donald Trump. Indeed, Republican lawmakers and candidates have made that a bedrock of their campaigns leading up to the midterms, warning that they're the only ones standing between the president and vengeful Democrats.\n\nBut few Democrats want to actively talk about impeaching President Donald Trump. For many, whether in the Capitol or on the campaign trail, the issue is a nuisance and a distraction from more serious issues. Senior leadership has also repeatedly cautioned against impeachment, warning that it would only deepen partisan squabbling in Congress.\n\nThe House previously tabled attempts by Rep. Al Green of Texas, a Democrat, to impeach Trump. The most recent instance occurred in January, when only 66 Democrats voted to keep the impeachment resolution, compared with 121 who sided with all House Republicans. Three Democrats voted \"present.\"\n\nRead more:More Americans are calling for Trump's impeachment than ever \u2014 here's how that would play out\n\nDemocratic operatives have also been irked by the billionaire megadonor Tom Steyer and his \"Need to Impeach\" campaign.\n\nSteyer has launched high-dollar campaigns calling for Trump to be impeached, in which he tells voters, \"People in Congress and his own administration know this president is a clear and present danger who is mentally unstable and armed with nuclear weapons ... and they do nothing.\"\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the current chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told Business Insider in May that Democrats needed to navigate their campaigns the way they see fit.\n\nBut regarding Steyer's impeachment effort, he said, \"I would use my resources a little differently.\"", "In August, Lockheed Martin finished 17 years of upgrades to the Air Force's C-5M Super Galaxy, delivering the 52nd aircraft to the service under the Reliability and Re-engineering Program, which began in 2001.\n\nAt 65 feet tall, 247 feet long, and with a wingspan of 223 feet, the C-5 is the largest transport plane in use by the US Air Force.\n\nIt can haul 120,000 pounds of cargo more than 5,500 miles \u2014 the distance from Dover Air Force base in Delaware to Incirlik airbase in Turkey \u2014 without refueling. Without cargo, that range is more than 8,000 miles.\n\nThe upgrade program involved 70 modifications to improve the plane's reliability, efficiency, maintainability, and availability. Among them were changes to the airframe; to its environmental, pneumatic, and hydraulic systems; and to the landing gear and flight controls.\n\nAn Air Force C-5M Super Galaxy taking off. Lockheed Martin\n\nThe main addition was more powerful engines\u2014 an upgrade from four General Electric TF-39 engines to GE F-138 engines, which are quieter and will allow the Super Galaxy to haul more cargo with less room needed for takeoff.\n\nAll together, RERP upgrades yielded \"a 22 percent increase in thrust, a shorter takeoff roll; [and] a 58 percent improvement in climb rate,\" according to a Lockheed release, which said the modifications also gave the C-5M greater fuel efficiency and reduced its need for tanker support.\n\nThose upgrades extend the Super Galaxy's service life in the 2040s. But they didn't make the Air Force's largest plane any more comfortable to fly.

Paul Gonzalez, the officer-in-charge of the C-5M refurbishment program team at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York, told Air Force Magazine.\n\nGonzalez said his team overhauled the C-5Ms' interiors, re-doing many of the features that make using the aircraft bearable for the crews who fly them.\n\nThey revamped or replaced interior panels, cleaned up crew and passenger seating, and added decals, according to Air Force Magazine. They also reapplied non-skid materials the cargo area for safety purposes.\n\nA Georgia Army National Guard helicopter crew load a UH-60 Black Hawk on an US Air Force Reserve C-5M Super Galaxy at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Marietta, Georgia, July 24, 2018.

US Air Force/Yasuo Osakabe\n\nThe C-5 modernization push began in 1998. The first upgraded one was delivered in 2009 and the final arrived earlier this year \u2014 two decades later. But now the Air Force is planning more changes for its airlift fleet.\n\nIn September, the service detailed its goal to build the \"Air Force We Need\" by adding another 74 squadrons by 2030, bringing the total to 386 squadrons. The proposal called for 14 more tanker squadrons and one additional airlift squadron.\n\nAir Mobility Command chief Gen. Maryanne Miller said at the end of October that analysis in the plan supported the addition of three new C-17 Globemaster III squadrons and the elimination of two C-130J Hercules squadrons.\n\nA C-17 Globemaster III at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, April 26, 2015. US Air Force photo\n\nThe Air Force is in the process of returning to service eight C-5Ms put in reserve due to the sequester, but those will go to existing squadrons rather than to starting new ones.\n\nDozens of older C-5s were retired earlier this decade, but there are no plans to pull them out of the boneyard \u2014 where the Air Force previously got parts to repair other C-5s\u2014 and upgrade them to augment the airlift fleet.\n\nAir Force studies found that the newer C-17, a strategic airlifter, is in higher demand than the much older C-130, a tactical aircraft put to use in transport, airborne assault, search and rescue, aerial refueling, and other roles.\n\nThe rejiggering described by Miller, first reported by Defense News, would give the service 54 airlift squadrons \u2014 one more than it has now.\n\nAn Army M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System is unloaded from a C-17 Globemaster III, at Hurlburt Field, Florida.

The firm produced its last Globemaster in 2015, according to Defense News.\n\nRestarting it would be an expensive proposition, and Miller said it's one the service has not discussed with Boeing, stressing that discussions of the airlift fleet's future composition will also be shaped by a study that is underway.\n\n\"Those are the details that we have not looked at,\" Miller said of restarting the production line. \"That will be the next discussion as we proceed, talking with Congress and working with Congress, because the same would apply for the tanker fleet. An additional 14 squadrons by 2030 \u2014 what would be the path to get there?\"", "Michelle Alphe's French classes in Franklin High School, about 40 miles southwest of New York City, begin the same way most days: with a Chromebook.\n\n\"Before class, I'll post their assignments [on Google Classroom] and the students get right on the computers, log into Classroom, and can start working right away,\" Alphe told Business Insider.\n\nAdvanced classes might read an article in French, then record a video in which they discuss what's different between the US and the country they read about. They then post the video on Google Classroom, and their peers watch and comment on the video.\n\n\"At first I was resistant to it \u2014 I'm a technophobe,\" Alphe told Business Insider. \"Now, I really like it. It's made my life a lot easier. I think it has made students' work easier too.\"\n\nThis scene is repeated in classrooms around the US, where education is increasingly starting to revolve around Google for Education apps and Google's Chromebook laptops.\n\nGoogle says there are 80 million educators and students globally using G Suite for Education, which allows users to access Gmail, Google Cloud, Google Docs, and other productivity tools. There are 40 million global users of Google Classroom specifically.\n\nWorldwide, there are 30 million Chromebooks in classrooms, the majority of which are in the US. Fifty-eight percent of the classroom laptops ordered in the US last year were Chromebooks. These laptops, which cost from $179 to $999 for typical customers, are manufactured by brands like Lenovo, Acer, and HP.\n\nGoogle is not alone in trying to making inroads on the hardware and software sides of the classroom. There are software tools like Canvas, where students can access documents and information for their classes, or Safari Montage, a repository for textbooks and other class materials.\n\nThe average cost for learning management software is $5 to $8 per student annually, according to Ben Davis, a senior educator analyst at the market-research firm Futuresource Consulting. For a district such as Baltimore, which has over 113,000 students, that could cost nearly $1 million a year.\n\nBut Google Classroom and G Suite for Education are totally free. Google has tens of millions of users for its education software, but it chooses not to make a cent off of them.\n\nAs for the laptops, they're deeply discounted. Institutional pricing for an iPad, once the standby education hardware nationwide, is $299 while Microsoft devices start at $189. Google said a single Chromebook starts at $149 per unit for classrooms.\n\nAndy Kiersz/Business Insider; Google, Apple, and Windows education pricing\n\nGoogle has created teaching courses and certifications, engages in educator outreach nationwide, and creates tools like a closed-captioning function for students giving presentations on Google Slides.\n\n\"You could argue that part of it is philanthropic,\" Jonathan Rochelle, a product management director for G Suite for Education, told Business Insider. \"But for us, having educators and students experience our products is important.\"\n\nHe added: \"Our motivation is to make sure people have an option to work better.\"\n\nBut Google for Education has raised suspicions for ed-tech analysts and educators.\n\n\"They are still selling their Google products to kids, who are being taught to trust them,\" Keith Chiappone, an eighth-grade English teacher at Conackamack Middle School in Piscataway Township, New Jersey. \"Then, when they are of age where they can legally make decisions, that's going to be their default.\"\n\nThe first push for educational tech came from state legislatures, not Silicon Valley\n\nClassrooms like Alphe's, where students have their own laptops, may seem over the top to those who managed to learn to read and write without computers or with occasional visits to the school computer lab.\n\nBut districts that furnish each student with a laptop aren't doing so by their own choice alone. Since the late 2000s, legislatures in states such as Florida, Virginia, and California began passing laws to call for digital classrooms and textbooks.\n\n\"There's an increasing push to have our students become digitally literate and move into the workforce seamlessly through the use of digital tools,\" said Elita Driskill, the director of technology for Arlington Independent School District in Arlington, Texas, which serves 61,000 students. \"The state recognizes the need for students to be ready for the workplace.\"\n\nInitiatives for \"digital content\" initially put undue pressure on district administrators, said Dwayne Alton, who is in charge of information technology for the School District of Lee County in Fort Myers, Florida, the 33rd-largest in the US with 93,000 students.\n\nRead more: Here's how technology is shaping the future of education\n\n\"The legislature thought, 'Hey, we're going to be super modern,'\" Alton told Business Insider. \"'We think that books are old-fashioned. Kids should be learning with technology and school districts should be required to transition from paper to digital content.'\"\n\nAround 20 to 30% of US school districts have one laptop for every child, according to Futuresource Consulting. Kevin Jarrett/Flickr\n\nAt first, digital content meant PDFs of textbooks. Now teachers can track students' progress through in-class activities in real time and assess where a student is excelling or needs help. It's allowed for individual learning beyond separating kids into slow and fast reading groups.\n\n\"We know that students move at different paces,\" Alton said. \"We want to make sure we're not just teaching to the middle, but providing enrichment for the higher levels and remediation for the lower levels.\"\n\nTech companies have taken advantage of the shift to digital classrooms\n\nThat shift to digital has fueled fast growth in the US ed-tech market, which has been growing by 8.8% since 2014. Ed tech is expected to hit $43 billion in value by 2019, just under half of which is based in K-12.\n\n\"The market is right at the beginning of digital transformation with devices coming into student hands, and so lots of companies across the education ecosystem are investing in digital,\" Davis of Futuresource told Business Insider.\n\nEducation-only companies such as Blackboard, which was founded in 1997, and corporations like Microsoft and Apple had been long positioned in the classroom, and they looked poised to benefit from this growth.\n\nBut then Google entered the fray, and in a big way.\n\nRead more: Microsoft buys a classroom video startup with 20 million users as it pushes against Google\n\nDanny Wagner was a middle-school science teacher in his native Kentucky for nine years before he moved to the Bay Area to become a tech lead at San Francisco Unified School District. He was a teacher as Google Classroom first made its big push into the ed-tech market in the early 2010s, when state legislatures were pushing for digital classrooms.\n\n\"Going paperless was a big deal, and Google Classroom was the first tool that solved that problem,\" Wagner, who is now an editor of ed-tech reviews at Common Sense Media, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Google Classroom took off like grass on fire,\" Gartner Research vice president Kelly Calhoun Williams, who focuses on K-12 education and was in public education for 25 years, added. \"Just crazy growth.\"\n\nChromebooks and other Google devices made up 58% of all devices purchased for US classrooms in 2017, according to Futuresource data, up from 5% in 2012. Not every Chromebook-enabled school uses Google Classroom, and many classrooms without Chromebooks use Google Classroom or G Suite for Education.\n\nFuturesource Consulting, Andy Kiersz/Business Insider\n\nIn contrast, Apple's market share in mobile devices for education sank by 33 percentage points from 2012 to 2017, while Microsoft's decreased by 21 percentage points, according to Futuresource.\n\nTeacher-tested, administrator-approved\n\nFranklin High School has had G Suite for Education for only about four years, but Maggie Muir, who teaches Spanish at Franklin, has been using Google products in her classroom for a decade.\n\nMuir is enthusiastic about Google Classroom's features. She can quickly see how her students are performing on certain tasks. Absent students can keep up with assignments and activities by simply checking the Google Classroom homepage. It's easier for clubs to organize and for teachers to share learning resources with each other, she said.\n\nAs for the Chromebook, Muir said she's happy her students, many of whom are low income, have access to the technology. All Franklin students have Chromebooks thanks to a one-to-one initiative, in which each student has his or her own Chromebook starting in middle school. Davis of Futuresource said between 20% and 30% of US classrooms have similar one-to-one programs.\n\nMuir has used Angel, Blackboard, Canvas, and other education apps, but says Google is just better.\n\n\"I can edit a Google Doc on my phone,\" Muir went on. \"I can connect with Google Classroom on my phone no matter where I am. There are a lot of options and accessibility. It makes it so easy. Everything is there.\"\n\nAccording to Rochelle, the G Suite for Education product manager, Google created Google Classroom as a response to educators using Google Docs as a collaboration tool among other teachers and for their students.\n\nGoogle Classroom doesn't address every classroom need. Muir still uses Genesis to record grades, attendance, and higher-level demographic and conduct information. Its simplicity is part of why it's won over so many teachers, Williams of Gartner Research said.\n\n\"It was hugely popular because it was just so darn simple,\" Williams said. \"Anybody could pick it up and understand what it was for and use it.\"\n\nBUF Simrishamn/Flickr\n\nJennifer Guzio, a teacher at Parsons Elementary School in North Brunswick, New Jersey, said Google Classroom is incredibly easy to use, particularly because she already had a Gmail account. That familiarity with Google products is good for tech-averse educators, she said.\n\n\"I know a lot of teachers who are overwhelmed by the technology and feel a little lost,\" Guzio told Business Insider.\n\nBut one benefit overshadowed all the rest, Wagner of Education Reviews said. \"It was free. You cannot [overstate] how important that was for Google Classroom's success.\"\n\nDigitizing classrooms is expensive. Driskell said that Arlington purchased Chromebook carts, allowing one laptop for every student, because it was \"an affordable option.\"\n\nAlton said the Lee County School District is using more free content, such as Khan Academy, and that its spending on technology has increased over the years. It has 70,000 Chromebooks in the district.\n\nGoogle's motives are 'clear,' but teachers use it anyway\n\nJoanna Petrone, a middle-school English teacher in the Bay Area, uses Google Classroom every day, but finds the tool \"a little creepy.\"\n\nShe said she feels that with Google's teacher-certification programs and suggested curriculum plans, the company is overstepping certain legal boundaries. While including corporate messaging in schools is typically met with resistance, Google for Education liberally includes its branding in digital citizenship courses that several teachers told Business Insider they had their students take.\n\nSo through Classroom, Google can acclimatize millions of children to its products.\n\n\"It's pretty clear what motive Google has,\" Williams at Gartner Research said. \"This is not a product they're selling; this is not a commercial product. It's getting lots of people very used to working in a Google environment.\"\n\nNearly 60% of devices shipped to US classrooms in 2017 were Chromebooks, according to Futuresource Consulting. BUF Simrishamn/Flickr\n\nEven teachers who feel squeamish about the product don't have an option but to use it. Chromebooks are the technology furnished in Petrone's district, while Chiappone of Piscataway said he was required to use Google Classroom in his previous district.\n\n\"It's not our choice what software we use,\" Chiappone said. \"Every school district will purchase a license for specific software. We can't really go and say, 'I'm going to go use this other software,' because just about everything has a subscription fee.\"\n\nAbove all, teachers said they were already strapped for time and energy. There simply aren't enough hours in the day to ponder how their district-provided software might be affecting them and their students.\n\n\"There is a bit of a mistrust to Google in some way from the teacher standpoint because it is such a large corporation offering everything for free,\" Wagner said. \"They know there's a manipulation at work, they are aware that there's a manipulation, but no one really knows to what end.\"\n\nHe added, \"But while we ponder these overarching questions, teachers still have to get things done.\"'\n\nAre you an educator or a student who uses Google products in the classroom?

Nadella's goal was to transform the company's culture, and so at his first executive meeting, he passed out copies of the 2003 book \"Nonviolent Communication\" by psychologist Marshall B.

Although the book has nothing to do with business, it provides a critical lesson in leadership and teamwork.\n\nRead more: How Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella did what Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates couldn't\n\nAccording to the book, communication between people often breaks down when we fail to accurately convey how we feel.\n\nOften, when we try to express a feeling, it comes out as a judgment or criticism of someone else. For example, if you say, \"I feel like I'm being misunderstood,\" you're not actually expressing a feeling \u2014 you're just assessing someone else's ability to understand you. Perhaps the underlying feeling is anxiety, annoyance, or something else.\n\nLikewise, a thought like \"I feel unimportant to the people with whom I work\" also doesn't express an actual feeling; it simply describes how you think other people are evaluating you. The underlying feeling might be sadness, discouragement, or frustration.\n\nRosenberg goes on to list several words we often use to describe how we feel that are actually just interpretations of other people's actions. If you catch yourself using any of these words to describe your feelings, he suggests taking a moment to reevaluate the underlying feeling prompting those thoughts.\n\nWords we use to express what other people are doing to us, rather than how we actually feel:\n\nabandoned\n\nabused\n\nattacked\n\nbetrayed\n\nbullied\n\ncheated\n\ndiminished\n\nintimidated\n\nlet down\n\nmanipulated\n\nmisunderstood\n\nneglected\n\noverworked\n\npatronized\n\npressured\n\nrejected\n\ntaken for granted\n\nthreatened\n\nunappreciated\n\nunheard\n\nunsupported\n\nunwanted\n\nused\n\nOn the other hand, here are some of the words that could describe how we actually feel when we evaluate people with those words:\n\nalarmed\n\nangry\n\nanxious\n\nashamed\n\nconfused\n\ndisgusted\n\ndispleased\n\nembarrassed\n\nexhausted\n\nfurious\n\nguilty\n\njealous\n\nmiserable\n\nnervous\n\nresentful\n\nsad\n\nshocked\n\nsurprised\n\nsuspicious\n\nterrified\n\nuncomfortable\n\nuneasy\n\nworried\n\nArming yourself with a better vocabulary for expressing your feelings is key to getting your needs met in any situation, Rosenberg writes.\n\n\"When we express our needs indirectly through the use of evaluations, interpretations, and images, others are likely to hear criticism,\" he writes. \"And when people hear anything that sounds like criticism, they tend to invest their energy in self-defense or counterattack.\"\n\nFor example, imagine the response you might get if you accuse a coworker of insulting you or say something like \"I feel so insulted.\" Now, Rosenberg writes, imagine the response if you clearly articulated your feelings, like in the sentence \"I feel angry when you say that, because I am wanting respect and I hear your words as an insult.\"\n\n\"If we wish for a compassionate response from others, it is self-defeating to express our needs by interpreting or diagnosing their behavior,\" he writes. \"Instead, the more directly we can connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond to us compassionately.\"", "The Los Angeles Lakers have had a slow, up-and-down start to the season, and at 3-5, pressure is already mounting on head coach Luke Walton.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, team president Magic Johnson met with Walton and \"admonished\" him for the Lakers' slow start, sending the message to turn things around.\n\nWojnarowski described Johnson's feedback as \"cutting,\" leaving the feeling that Walton and the coaching staff are under pressure to win now.\n\nThe Lakers start to the season has been rocky, but not totally unexpected. Much of the roster is new, and they're adjusting to the presence of LeBron James, who changes the way an entire franchise operates.

Though Johnson landed James in free agency, the rest of the Lakers' plan baffled the NBA world. In blending James with the Lakers young, promising core, Johnson and the front office signed journeymen and role players to make up the rest of the roster.\n\nIn doing so, they also added players who lack the type of shooting and defense that have proven effective around James throughout his career, opting instead for ball-handlers and long, athletic players.\n\nMost of the NBA world wasn't impressed with the Lakers' offseason, but some thought they could still make the playoffs, mostly because of James' greatness.\n\nRead more: LeBron James is so good the NBA world thinks he alone is enough to drag a head-scratching Lakers squad to the playoffs\n\nThrough eight games, the Lakers have been an efficient offensive team but a weak defensive team, ranking 23rd in defensive rating.

According to Wojnarowski, Walton has the \"unwavering\" support of team owner Jeannie Buss, but Walton had already been hired when Buss brought on Johnson and Pelinka.

But he did respond to Republican Sen. Bob Corker's remark that Trump had \"publicly castrated\" him with tweets apparently undermining his diplomatic efforts, quipping to CNN's Jake Tapper, \"I've checked.

The original FOIA request was filed in October 2017, and the group filed a lawsuit in March 2018 after the government declined to release any responsive records. The emails were released to Democracy Forward late last month.\n\nA complicated relationship\n\nNauert's emails illustrate the difficult relationship she had with Tillerson, who excluded his spokeswoman from meetings, rarely afforded her one-on-one time, and did not invite her on his international trips.\n\nA senior State Department official, who requested anonymity to avoid jeopardizing relations with coworkers, recently told Business Insider that Tillerson \"completely shut [Nauert] out,\" adding that she was viewed \"as a spy for the White House.\" Nauert, who maintained the trust of the White House throughout, reportedly considered resigning on multiple occasions.\n\nNauert appears to have a close working relationship with Tillerson's replacement, former CIA director Mike Pompeo, with whom she travels extensively.\n\nRead more: How Heather Nauert's unlikely rise at the State Department has made her a top contender for White House press secretary\n\nSenior administration officials told multiple news outlets on Thursday that Trump has asked Nauert to replace UN ambassador Nikki Haley, who announced last month that she'll leave her post by the end of the year.\n\n\"She's under very serious consideration.

You've got to go 3-D.\"\n\nBy 3-D, Musk means making more tunnels \u2014 tunnels that go deeper into the earth's crust, where they can crisscross, overlap, and do things traditional tunnels haven't done because of how expensive they are to bore.\n\n\"The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive,\" said Musk. \"And they've also been incredibly slow.\"\n\nHis solution? A cheaper tunneling solution.\n\n\"You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels,\" Musk said, \"but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don't do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to, you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other \u2026 the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology.

That follows Musk deleting his personal Instagram account in August.\n\nThen there's the question of capacity. Musk told Recode that he has never met a single person who uses the subway, a statement that echoes his previously-aired fears of public transport. This is likely behind Musk's vision for traveling \"skates\" or mini pods that will transport far fewer people per vehicle than a traditional subway train car. As many transportation experts have pointed out, this greatly reduces total capacity for the system.\n\nOf course, hundreds of layers of tunnels could help with that capacity issue.\n\n\"Tunnels are really so underappreciated,\" Musk said.\n\nRead Recode's full interview here.\n\nMore from Elon Musk's Recode appearance:", "Starbucks is doubling down on drive-thrus.

After falling to 2-5-1 this year, the team decided to let go of the coach, all while reports of infighting between Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley swirled. Haley was also fired on Monday.\n\nIn an interview with Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot following the firing, Jackson discussed his time in Cleveland, saying he didn't feel as though he was able to do things his way because of the team's roster.\n\nIn his first two seasons, Jackson went just 1-31, as the team cycled through mediocre and backup quarterbacks. Jackson said that this lack of talent prevented him from running his offense.\n\n\"What everybody saw the first two years was not a Hue Jackson offense,\" Jackson said. \"And the people, players, and coaches that know me know that was the case. I had to do on offense what was necessary to be competitive each week. And we were.\"\n\nJackson served as offensive coordinator with the Cincinnati Bengals before taking the Browns job. Jackson told Cabot that heading into Year 3, the team asked him to bring in an offensive coordinator, a request he followed but disagreed with.\n\n\"People for some reason thought that I couldn't run an offense and that I needed to hire an OC. But I was never able to actually run my offense the first two years because we didn't have the players ... But it was recommended I bring in an OC to allow me to focus on leading the organization. In hindsight, it would've been in our best interest for me to continue doing what got me the job, and that was to run the offense with more talent on board.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Jackson alluded to getting more involved in the offense, though he stopped short of saying he'd take back play-calling duties. That supposedly fueled the rift between him and Haley, leading to internal discord. Jackson denied any internal strife to Cabot.\n\nJackson told Cabot that he loved quarterbacks like Carson Wentz, Patrick Mahomes, and Deshaun Watson, young stars in the league that the Browns all passed over in the draft. Jackson said the team wasn't interested in drafting a quarterback and referred to \"street free agents\" that played with the Browns.\n\nRead more: The Browns traded away the pick that became Carson Wentz, and it looks like more of a disaster each day\n\n\"We played with a QB room with zero wins in the league,\" Jackson said. \"We played with street free agents and practice squad players in [wide receivers].

Everest.\"\n\n\"The competitor in us, who thrives off and runs toward challenges \u2014 you're always looking for the next Mount Everest.

In the \"floating city\" of Venice, famous tourist attractions like St. Mark's Basilica and the Piazza San Marco were partially submerged in water, with the city's tourism hotspots being evacuated.\n\nThough the flooding is the worst the city has seen in a decade, it isn't entirely unexpected: Autumn to spring marks flooding season in Venice, or \"acqua alta\" \u2014 a period of exceptionally high tides in the Adriatic Sea.\n\nIn 2003, Italy began building a massive flood barrier designed to isolate the Venetian Lagoon, the enclosed bay where Venice is located. The project, known as Mose, is one of the largest civil engineering endeavors in the world.\n\nAround three-quarters of the city is underwater. Marco Secchi/Getty Images\n\nThe design consists of 78 mobile gates stationed at three different inlets. When the tide reaches 43 inches (which happens around four times a year), the gates will rise above the water's surface and protect the lagoon from flooding. When the tide dips, the gates fill with water and lower back in place.\n\nThe total barrier spans one mile and weighs around 300 tons. Though many see it as necessary to the city's immediate safety, the project has been shrouded in controversy and criticism.\n\nWhile citizens have long worried about the high cost of construction, which recently climbed to around $6.3 billion, the municipality of Venice has questioned the barrier's stability in the face of rising sea levels. Both environmental groups and the EU Commission have also expressed concern that construction would pollute the local habitat.\n\nMose is being held up in its final leg of construction. Marco Secchi/Getty Images\n\nThe biggest obstacle arrived in 2014, when then Mayor Giorgio Orsoni was arrested alongside 35 other people on corruption charges related to the project. Orsoni was accused of accepting bribes in exchange for awarding contracts, but he was absolved three years later.\n\nNow, Mose is being held up in its final leg of construction. The flood gates were originally set to open around 2011, but some officials don't expect them to be ready until 2022. As the project continues to stall, many have warned that mold and marine life are eroding the underwater structure.\n\nEarlier this week, Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said the destruction in Venice could have been prevented if Mose had been completed on time.", "Rapper Post Malone's Crocs collaboration has sold out less than a day after it launched.\n\nOn Thursday, Crocs announced a collaboration with Post Malone and debuted the new Dimitri Clog, along with six custom-designed Jibbitz charms.

Those are all useful tools for companies that want to streamline their operations and ensure their apps, software, and services stay up and available 24/7.\n\nAlong with these changes comes a rebranding for Opsgenie \u2014 including a new logo and a refreshed color scheme heavy on the blue \u2014 to better match the aesthetic of its new corporate parent.

Election experts have warned that aging voting equipment can result in failures and other issues.\n\nPolling places:\n\nA group of students from a historically black university in Prairie View, Texas, filed a lawsuit over a lack of early voting locations on campus or anywhere in the city during the first week of early voting. After the lawsuit was filed by five Prairie View A&M University students, Waller County elections officials added a day of early voting in Prairie View, which is predominantly black, for the first week and expanded hours during the second week.\n\nWhen voters in Dodge City, Kansas, head to their polling place this year, they will have to leave the city. Election officials have moved the lone polling place outside city limits, citing construction at the previous polling site. Voting rights groups already were upset that there was only one polling place for the city's 13,000 registered voters. They also worry about low turnout among Hispanics, who represent 60% of Dodge City's population.\n\nSEE ALSO: Tensions are running high in Texas, and people are reporting cases of voter intimidation at polling places\n\nSome voters in Barton County, Kansas, will have to travel 18 miles to get to their nearest polling site after officials cut the number of voting locations from 23 during the state primary to 11 for Tuesday's general election. County Clerk Donna Zimmerman says the polling places were consolidated to save money.\n\nAfter facing national criticism, election officials in a majority black county in rural south Georgia reversed course and withdrew a plan to eliminate seven of the county's nine voting locations.\n\nAn independent consultant had recommended the consolidations in Randolph County, noting the seven polling places did not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The consultant was later fired. County officials say they lack the money to make the necessary changes to comply with the ADA.\n\nAbsentee ballots\n\nA federal judge has ruled that Georgia election officials must provide time for voters to fix their absentee ballots when the signature on the ballot does not match the one on file with their local election office.\n\nThe ACLU and other civil rights group had sued the state after reports that a suburban Atlanta county had rejected a high rate of absentee ballots compared to other large counties in the metro area. Under the judge's order, voters would have almost a week to verify their identity and have their ballot counted.\n\nThe RNC plans to send new mailers and call voters to provide clarification that ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Mario Tama/Getty Some 10,000 voters received mailers from the Missouri Republican Party with incorrect information about when their absentee ballots are due. GOP officials blamed the issue on a miscommunication between the party and the vendor that printed the postcards. Absentee ballots are due on Election Day.\n\nIn Montana, an undetermined number of voters received a mailer from the Republican National Committee that included an error about the state's absentee ballot deadline. The RNC plans to send new mailers and call voters to provide clarification that ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nVoter registration\n\nA judge has ordered Tennessee's largest county to allow people with incomplete voter registration applications to fix any problems and vote on Election Day.\n\nGroups including the Tennessee Black Voter Project had submitted more than 36,000 registrations to the commission, but officials said about 55% were invalid because they were incomplete, were duplicates from previously registered voters or had come from convicted felons.\n\nIn Georgia, some 53,000 voter registration applications \u2014 the vast majority of which were submitted by black residents \u2014 are considered pending by the secretary of state's office because they ran afoul of the state's \"exact match\" law.\n\nVoters line up to cast their ballots on Super Tuesday March 1, 2016 in Fort Worth, Texas. 13 states and American Samoa are holding presidential primary elections, with over 1400 delegates at stake. Ron Jenkins/Getty Images The law requires information on the forms to precisely match records with either the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. Those flagged on the list, however, can still vote if they bring a valid photo ID that substantially matches the information on file. A photo ID is required of all voters in Georgia.\n\nIn St. Louis, Missouri, 600 people who recently registered to vote were mistakenly sent letters telling them they were ineligible. Election director Rick Stream said the error was the result of confusion by election workers processing forms that arrived after the state's October 10 deadline. Forms postmarked or signed by October 10 should have counted, regardless of when they arrived. Officials say they are working to notify those affected.\n\nVoter ID\n\nVoters in Arkansas will have to show a photo ID after the Arkansas Supreme Court on October 11 upheld a state law approved last year. Voters who come to the polls without a photo ID will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot if the voter signs a sworn affidavit or returns to the election office by noon the following Monday with his or her ID.\n\nThe provisional ballot will be counted as long as the county election commission doesn't invalidate it on other grounds.\n\nVoters in Missouri who do not bring a valid photo ID to the polls will not have to sign a sworn statement after a state judge set aside that requirement.\n\nThe October 9 ruling by Judge Richard Callahan also prevents the state from advertising that a photo ID is required to vote. Instead, voters who do not have a proper photo ID can cast a regular ballot if they show some other form of identification, such as a student ID card, utility bill, bank statement or paycheck that contains a home address.\n\nEarlier this year, a federal judge issued an injunction that would have allowed voters to use identification with a post office box, but that was later blocked on appeal. Matthew Cavanaugh/Getty Images Voters in North Dakota will be required to provide a photo ID with a street address in order to vote on Election Day. Members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians had sued over the requirement, arguing that street addresses aren't always assigned on reservations and the requirements discriminate against Native Americans.\n\nEarlier this year, a federal judge issued an injunction that would have allowed voters to use identification with a post office box, but that was later blocked on appeal. The Spirit Lake Sioux tribe has since filed another lawsuit challenging the street address requirement.\n\nVoter requirements\n\nA panel of federal judges has ruled that people in Ohio who had been removed from the list of registered voters for not casting ballots over a six-year period will be able to participate in Tuesday's election. A divided 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals panel granted an emergency motion sought by voting-rights groups.\n\nVoters who recently moved to New Hampshire will have to submit additional documentation after the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had placed the requirement on hold. The law requires voters who had moved to the state within 30 days of an election to provide proof they intend to stay.\n\nHow to get help\n\nVoters who encounter problems at the polls can seek assistance from the US Department of Justice at (800) 253-3931 or the nonpartisan Election Protection coalition at (866) OUR-VOTE.\n\nCompiled by Associated Press writer Christina A.

Others who only shop at stores when items are discounted also risk losing points because they are not seen as very valuable customers.\n\nThe resulting number then determines the prices you pay, the products and ads you see, and the perks you receive, Journal reporter Khadeeja Safdar wrote.\n\nSafdar outlined various examples of this across the retail sector. Higher-scoring customers might be given priority on calls to customer service and won't have to wait on hold for so long, they could get better deals if they threaten to leave their cellphone carrier, or they even get preferential treatment when their car breaks down and they need a replacement.\n\nOther companies are using the data to target their marketing.\n\nIt \"allows us to see beyond the day-to-day to ensure we're focused on the quality of the new customers we're acquiring, not just the quantity,\" Ed Boyle, senior director of performance marketing at Bonobos, told the Journal.\n\nOnline clothing store ASOS, which offers free delivery and returns, uses the CLV number to track customers who are making frequent returns and are ultimately costly to the business.\n\n\"Free shipping is vital in online clothing retail because customers need to try on items without being charged. Since ASOS do not recoup delivery costs for returned items, customers can easily have a negative lifetime value,\" the company wrote in a research note published in 2017.\n\nBy tracking these customers, it is able to \"rapidly identify and nurture high-value customers, who will go on to have high frequency, high-order size,\" it said.\n\nRead more: Amazon isn't alone in punishing shoppers for too many returns \u2014 these are all the companies that track your returns\n\nThe scoring works both ways, however. At some retailers, the higher the number, the less likely you are to receive bigger discounts.\n\nAccording to Jerry Jao, chief executive of Retention Science, which works with companies such as Target and Proctor & Gamble, some stores hold back discounts from higher-value customers until they are at risk of losing them.\n\n\"Why waste a 25% offer when the person is going to buy anyway?\" he told the Journal.\n\nThis isn't the only underground customer-tracking system that takes place in retail. Many stores such as Victoria's Secret, Best Buy, and Home Depot are also using third-party companies to track how many returns people make and, in some cases, punishing those who are suspected of abusing store return policies.", "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with Recode published on Friday that he \"probably\" wouldn't take an investment from Saudi Arabia in the wake of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death.\n\n\"Would you take their money now?\" Recode executive editor Kara Swisher asked.\n\n\"I think we probably would not, yes,\" Musk replied.\n\nSaudi Arabia's government has been under intense scrutiny since Khashoggi, a journalist who had written critically about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in early October.\n\nThe Saudi government has given multiple, inconsistent accounts of the events that led to Khashoggi's death that have been met with skepticism. While the Saudi government has denied that bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's death, a Reuters report from October suggested one of bin Salman's top aides directed Khashoggi's killing via Skype.\n\nRead more: Here's everything we know about the troubling disappearance and death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nKhashoggi's death has prompted questions about the role Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has played in financing American businesses and the ethics of taking investments from governments with reputations for violating human rights.\n\nBefore Khashoggi's death, Musk said in August that he had secured the funding necessary to convert Tesla into a private company, later saying he had met with the managing director of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund in July. Musk said he \"left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving.\"\n\nTesla ultimately remained a public company, and Musk's statements about potentially taking Tesla private led to an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a reported investigation from the Department of Justice.

Didriks/flickr\n\nThe holidays are a wonderful time of year, especially when it means getting together with family and friends you haven't seen in a while.\n\nDespite even the best intentions, catching up on the latest goings-on in people's lives can take a turn for the worse when awkward topics come up.\n\nFrom \"When are you going to have kids?\" and \"Are you in a relationship yet?\" to what will surely become classics this year, \"Who did you vote for?\" and \"This country's going to hell in a handbasket!\", certain topics should really remain off the table during this time together. But you try telling that to your 95-year-old grandma who says whatever she damn-well pleases.\n\nIf you're looking to keep things civil this holiday season, try these tips for navigating potentially awkward conversations:\n\n1. Set some ground rules\n\n\"You can set expectations before the meal even begins by saying something like, 'It has been a really interesting year for everyone, and I would like to ask that we not talk politics. We all have a lot to catch up on and connect over,'\" suggests Lizzie Post, co-author of several Emily Post etiquette books.\n\n2. Try starting with popular topics\n\nIf you know that a healthy dialogue about controversial topics is not possible at your holiday celebration, avoid the hot-button issues and stick to more popular and socially acceptable topics like sports. You could try throwing out something general like, \"How about them Cubs?\" and see who bites.\n\n\"Do not invest your time in a discussion where there is no chance of being heard,\" Dr. Michael McNulty, a master trainer from The Gottman Institute and founder of the Chicago Relationship Center, tells Business Insider. \"People have to be able to listen to and respect one another before a healthy dialogue can occur.\"\n\nRelated: 15 difficult etiquette questions your parents never had to ask\n\n3. Redirect the conversation to something personal and positive\n\n\"If there are still contentious conversations happening, it's important to redirect, not correct, so everyone feels comfortable,\" Post says.\n\nShe recommends saying something like, \"Sam, I'd love to get away from politics (or finances, religion, romantic drama, etc.) and hear about your vacation to Florida.\"\n\n\"By turning the conversation to more personal topics and encouraging discussion, you can be sure not to offend any of the guests while also maintaining a positive atmosphere at the table,\" Post says.\n\n4. Be firm but polite\n\nIf you try to redirect the conversation a few times and it's not working, Post says it's completely appropriate for you to say with a smile and a friendly, firm tone, \"We are finished talking about this at the table.\" And then once again, begin a new, positive conversation.\n\nRelated: 10 old-fashioned manners kids aren't taught anymore\n\n5. If debate is unavoidable, make it a dialogue\n\nIt's expected that families have diverse opinions, but if you have to keep talking about politics or other potentially contentious topics, it's best to change the debate into a dialogue in which everyone feels respected and understood, McNulty says.\n\n\"Dialogues are a way to understand and support one another, even when people have significantly different points of view,\" he explains.\n\nTo have a dialogue, McNulty suggests talking about your positions one at a time, telling the stories behind them that explain why they are important to you, and as you listen to others, summarizing and reflecting back what you are hearing.\n\n\"Do not attempt to changes people's minds. Show respect for each person. This is healthy for all involved,\" he says. \"In fact, people who are able to dialogue feel more connected to the ones they love, even with their differences.

After dancing with New York City Ballet for 10 years, she took a break to go back to school. After graduating from Columbia, she worked with Natalie Portman on \"Black Swan,\" and subsequently created her ballet-integrated exercise regimen. Since launching, she has gained a strong celebrity following, including several Victoria's Secret Angels.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nMary Helen Bowers: I'm Mary Helen Bowers, founder of Ballet Beautiful Fitness. I danced with New York City Ballet for 10 years. Ballet Beautiful is really born from my experience as a professional dancer and that whole life experience of being a dancer, which is so incredibly physical, where you are using your body to express your art. And I had to learn, and it took a lot of trial and error for me to figure out the best system to take care of my body, to prevent injury, to feel my strongest, my leanest, and my best.\n\nOnce I left the company, I took a break from dancing. I needed time where I wasn't in a dance studio, where I didn't have that pressure to look a certain way, to perform a certain way. And when I wanted to start working out I had gained weight, my body had changed. I also didn't want to go back into a ballet studio, I felt self-conscious. So I started picking up with my old exercises. I would do 45 minutes a day. And my body started to change. I got leaner and really all of my ballet muscles kind of came back into use. And with that process, my whole body began to change.\n\nI started sharing my workout with friends. All of our clients have really been built through word of mouth. One of the first Victoria's Secret Angels that I worked with was Miranda Kerr, who is a long-time client and a very dear friend of mine. We're still working together today. And it's been fun to train with people like Miranda and like Lily Aldridge. Through having a baby, through, maybe, a second pregnancy.\n\nFor some people it's through multiple seasons of doing a show like Victoria's Secret, or a big film, or runway moment. But it's been really exciting, too, for me, to take these women through some really momentous moments in their careers. And be there to support them, to help them feel strong, to help them feel confident, and perform at their best level as well.\n\nWith the Angels, they're training really, really, hard. I'm using ballet inside the workout, but I'm thinking of it as a really, really focused, crazy, I want the deepest burn. I want to give them the biggest impact. We're trying to make their abs as toned as possible, to make their butts as lifted and toned as possible, to give them sleek definition through their legs. And beautiful posture and strength to hold, those wings for example, which really weigh a lot.\n\nSo it's not that I'm giving them a workout that someone else couldn't do. But certainly we are doing a really intensified version of the program.\n\nA mutual friend that I had danced with, with New York City Ballet, connected me with Natalie. She was in town. She was looking for a new trainer and for somebody to help prepare her for \"Black Swan.\" She danced really seriously until she was about 12 or 13, when her acting career took off. So we had to kind of bring her up to speed with her dancing.\n\n\"Black Swan,\" I think, played a huge role in bringing ballet into the spotlight, making it cool, making it hip and relevant in pop culture. And of course, Natalie's role in that was huge. And I was so fortunate to have been such a big part of that film. And it also brought ballet fitness into the press, into I think, the sort of lexicon of the everyday woman.\n\nYou don't have to be a professional dancer or to have trained your body for a dozen years to experience ballet, to bring it into your home. You feel better, you have more energy. Your body feels stronger. You start to see results. It's really, really motivating. And as you get going, you can build that momentum to make fitness a more regular part of your life, a larger part of your life. You can prioritize.\n\nAnd it takes some work to say, \"I'm gonna carve this time out just for me.\" Don't wait for life to be perfect because it's busy and it's messy, and you just have to start where you are.", "When it comes to the best internship programs, it's a given that you won't just be fetching coffee.

Match.com owns the market. No one's ever going to be able to break into it.\"\n\nThis was more than seven years ago, back before dating apps had taken off (Tinder launched in 2012). But McLeod, Hinge's CEO, was relatively certain that the app \u2014 which initially matched users with people they were connected to through mutual Facebook friends \u2014 would be a hit.\n\nToday, Hinge has raised more than $20 million, according to Crunchbase, and is one of the most popular dating apps in the US.\n\nRelated: An entrepreneur who dropped out of Harvard Business School to launch his startup made a key hiring mistake that stalled the company's progress for years\n\nWhen McLeod advises early stage entrepreneurs, he mentions his own determination to make Hinge work, even in the face of resistance. But he also cautions those founders to listen to their critics and to be willing to change course if necessary.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, McLeod said, you must have \"this naivet\u00e9 and belief that you're going to make this succeed no matter what. But, on the other hand, if you hold too closely to your vision, and you're not flexible, and you're not willing to change it, and you're not willing to evolve over time, then you can just hold onto some vision that's not working.\"\n\nMcLeod knows firsthand about the importance of flexibility. In 2016, he made the decision to \"reboot\" Hinge, most notably removing the swiping feature so the app could appeal more to users interested in serious relationships.\n\nThis decision, McLeod said, was based partly on the publication of a Vanity Fair article about the dating \"apocalypse,\" and partly on McLeod's observation that Hinge had become too similar to other dating apps on the market.\n\n\"If you always listen to everyone else, then you'll never do anything new,\" McLeod said. \"And if you never listen to anyone else, then you'll get to the point where you might do something crazy, or you're just banging your head against the wall.\"\n\nHe added that at Hinge, \"Doing things the same way we've always done as the company continues to grow and the market continues to change is just a recipe for disaster.\"", "Hackers stole the private Facebook messages of over 81,000 accounts, a BBC investigation has revealed.\n\nThe hackers posted ads, one of which was spotted by the BBC on an English language web forum, offering to sell access to people's accounts for 10 cents each.\n\nThe BBC discovered the ad in September, which claimed: \"We sell personal information of Facebook users.

When the team's starting quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, suffered an ACL tear in September, San Francisco brought the 23-year-old onto the team's active roster.\n\nBut before Mullens began to prove himself worthy of the starting role Thursday night, virtually no one had taken notice of the Hoover, Alabama, native. In fact, he was so unknown that Twitter first verified his account only midway through Thursday night's contest:\n\nMullens certainly earned that blue checkmark next to his name. He completed 16 of 22 passing attempts for 262 yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions en route to a 34-3 trouncing of the Oakland Raiders in the final \"Battle of the Bay\" before the Raiders are due to move to Las Vegas. Mullens' whopping 151.9 passer rating comes within 6.4 of the perfect 158.3 score \u2014 a feat achieved just twice since the young quarterback first signed with San Francisco. His passer rating was also the best among debuting quarterbacks with at least 20 passing attempts since 1970, according to ESPN's Nick Wagoner.\n\n\"He's a machine in there and I was happy for him,\" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said, per Wagoner. \"He didn't surprise us in terms of, the game's not too big for Nick.

By nature, Hudson Yards has a relatively small reach. But by allowing customers to test new payment types, the firm could help form habits among residents or regular visitors while encouraging new users to familiarize themselves with these options. That could boost two offerings in particular:\n\nContactless cards: Contactless physical cards are becoming increasingly popular outside of the US. Payments on these cards, which use NFC technology, comprise 40% of non-US Visa transactions, according to the firm, and are approaching ubiquity in some international markets like the UK. However, they haven't yet caught on in the US. But that's beginning to change as more contactless cards are being issued \u2014 Visa's US partners are expected to issue 100 million by the end of 2019 \u2014 and a wider variety of merchants are accepting and promoting NFC-enabled card payments, according to Visa. Spreading awareness and encouraging usage in such an environment could help the firm boost those efforts.\n\nMobile payments: In-store mobile payments, like those using Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay, have also seen tepid support in the US. But there's some movementin the space at long last, which means opportunities to normalize contactless payments and encourage usage could be fruitful. Physical contactless card usage is a proven driver of mobile payment adoption, so promoting these experiences could help Visa push emerging payments across the board.", "A San Francisco 49ers cheerleader took a knee during the national anthem at Thursday night's home game against the Oakland Raiders, in what is believed to be the first case of an NFL cheerleader joining the national protest.\n\nFormer 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the movement more than two years ago, when he decided to stay seated during the national anthem to protest racial inequality. He left the team in 2017 to become a free agent and has not been rehired since, which he believes is due to his decision to make a political statement.\n\nThe identity of the Gold Rush Squad member who kneeled is still a mystery.

AP/Mike McCarn\n\nMost owners appear to agree with Trump, and in May, they passed a new policy whereby teams would be fined for any players who didn't stand for the anthem (players would be allowed to opt out of attending the pregame song by staying in the locker room if they wish).

The addition of 250,000 jobs in October \u2014 well above economists' expectations of 200,000 \u2014 also came with the strongest wage growth since April 2009, with average hourly earnings increasing at a 3.1% pace year over year.\n\nRepublicans pointed to the strong wage and job growth numbers as evidence that the party's tax law and economic policies had helped grow the economy.\n\n\"While Democrats again this week pledged to raise taxes on hardworking Americans and take more money away from Main Street businesses, Republicans know our workers deserve a pro-growth economy like the one we're seeing that truly works for them,\" said Rep.

Even Jason Furman, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, acknowledged that some of the growth was most likely attributable to the tax law.\n\n\"The 213k jobs per month in 2018 (to date) is a marked upshift from the 182K last year,\" Furman tweeted. \"The combination of tax cuts and spending increases have probably added about 50K jobs per month this year.

This would be a 14.8% year-over-year (YoY) increase, representing a slight acceleration from the 14.7% YoY growth seen during last year's holiday season.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThe forecast also predicts that e-commerce's growth will significantly outpace that of total retail, which is projected to grow between 4.3% YoY and 4.8% YoY by the National Retail Federation.\n\nThanksgiving Weekend, which runs from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday and includes Black Friday, is expected to account for 19% of the season's online sales. That means the five-day period would rack up $23.4 billion in US e-commerce sales, making it incredibly important for retailers to capitalize on if they want to secure a strong online performance for the holidays.\n\nBecause of the extreme increases in traffic and purchases \u2014 Adobe expects the period of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. PT on Cyber Monday to bring in more online revenue than an average full day in 2018 \u2014 retailers must make sure their websites are able to handle such volume and avoid malfunctions and downtime, or they'll risk alienating customers and losing out on sales.\n\nOmnichannel is set to be key for the holidays, as retailers with both an online and physical presence are projected to have better conversion rates online than e-commerce pureplays. Adobe expects retailers that have footprints in both channels to have a 28% higher conversion rate than retailers that don't have a \"traditional storefront.\" This may be the case because shoppers can see products in-person before buying them online. And the opportunity to pick up online orders in-store may also contribute to this, as it gives consumers more control over their order delivery.\n\nThe increased number of returns during the holidays may further emphasize the value of brick-and-mortar. Adobe predicts that 18% of online orders will be shipped and returned over the holidays, a significant bump from the 5% rate seen year-round.\n\nHandling returns can be expensive for retailers, but facilitating them through a physical location offers them more control of the process. And many consumers prefer to make returns in-store, with some making additional purchases while they're there, so retailers would do well to make sure their physical locations are prepared to handle the high volume of returns for the holidays.", "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with Recode published on Friday there's a \"good chance\" Ford doesn't survive the next recession.\n\nMusk was discussing the difficulty of creating a successful auto company and how Tesla, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler (now Fiat Chrysler) struggled during the 2008 recession.\n\n\"There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed, even the ones that have had a strong base of customers, thousands of dealers, thousands of service centers, they've already spent the capital for the factories, like GM and Chrysler, still went bankrupt in the last recession.

The service \u2014 which is currently live at 350 CVS stores in Boston \u2014 looks similar to what Amazon's expected to eventually offer through its purchase of online pharmacy PillPack for $1 billion in June.\n\nCVS and Amazon have been preparing for a standoff in the prescription drug market.Amazon's expanding role in healthcare was likely a factor in CVS' move to spend $69 billion on acquiring insurer Aetna in December 2017. CVS also launched same-day delivery for medications in June, a nod to the convenient delivery services Amazon offers for consumer goods.\n\nAmazon, in addition to purchasing PillPack, sent a shot across the bow of CVS and other retail pharmacies last week with an announcement that it's selling an exclusive brand of consumer medical devices to help customers manage chronic disease. Amazon indicated the new brand will offer \"exceptional value versus what is available at traditional retail pharmacy outlets.\"\n\nConsumers have indicated they could be enticed to leave CVS for an Amazon pharmacy.

Many states will see small increases, and some will even experience decreases in premiums.\n\nWhy exactly we aren't seeing the sky-high premium increases of previous years is a matter of some political debate, but many experts say that the improving costs are simply a function of time.\n\nThe map\n\nFor the 39 states that use the federally facilitated Healthcare.gov platform, open enrollment runs from November 1 until December 15 (other states may have longer enrollment periods).\n\nThis is half the length of open enrollment periods under former President Barack Obama. But consumers in most states should be getting some relief from the skyrocketing premiums of recent years. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health-policy think tank, crunched the numbers on premiums for every state and found a more favorable environment for consumers compared to previous years.\n\nTo determine a benchmark for premiums, Kaiser used the second-lowest cost silver-level plan for a 40-year-old male. (While the Department of Health and Human Services uses a 27-year-old male for its benchmark, the actual pool of enrollees is typically a bit older.)\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nOverall, the United States saw an average premium decrease of 0.83% from 2018 to 2019 plans:\n\n19 states posted premiums declines.\n\n13 states saw increases of between 0% and 5%.\n\nFor states that use the federal Healthcare.gov platform, the decline will be even better, with premiums dropping 1.5% on average.\n\nOn the other end, there were only six states to post double-digit increases for benchmark premiums: Vermont, North Dakota, Delaware, Washington, Hawaii, and New York. Washington, DC, also posted a 16.13% jump.\n\nThe premium increases for 2019 are a far cry from just two years ago, when some states were facing jumps as high as 116% in Arizona. Trump, then a candidate, and the GOP used the premium jumps as an effective weapon against Hillary Clinton and many Democratic candidates.\n\nDuring that election, Republicans promised to repeal and replace the ACA, a promise they failed to keep. The Trump administration and the GOP have made major changes to the healthcare system, but whether those are the reason for the easing of increases is up for debate.\n\nWhy are premiums going down?\n\nSeema Verma, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, took credit for the drop.\n\n\"President Trump's Administration took action to address the skyrocketing price of health insurance, and now we are starting to see the results,\" Verma said.\n\nThe administration took a series of actions to shake up the ACA marketplaces, including the expansion of short-term, limited-duration health plans. In addition, the GOP repealed the individual mandate \u2014 the requirement every American have insurance or face a financial penalty \u2014 as part of the tax reform law.\n\nWhile Republicans pointed to those actions as examples of policies that reduced premiums, health-policy analysts have argued they have weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions and could eventually drive up costs for sicker people who remain in the Obamacare markets.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBut even in terms of 2019's cost, recent studies showed that premiums are coming down in spite of Trump's changes \u2014 not because of them:\n\nResearchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation went through insurer filings and various data to model just how much the Trump administration's actions influenced premiums and found that the meddling actually made premiums higher than they would have been otherwise.\n\nThe main reason for 2019's premium drop is that profit margins on many insurers' Obamacare products grew after the large price jumps in previous years.\n\nThose companies could now correct back in the other direction by lowering premiums.\n\nBut the Trump administration's actions forced the insurers to keep the premiums 16% higher than they would be otherwise, Kaiser said.\n\n\"Instead of 2019 benchmark silver premiums on healthcare.gov averaging $495 per month for a 40-year-old, as was recently reported by HHS, we estimate the premium would be approximately $427 in the absence of individual mandate penalty repeal, expansion of more loosely regulated plans, and the loss of cost-sharing subsidy payments,\" the report said.\n\nAnother study by Matthew Fiedler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, found a smaller potential plunge.\n\n\"Indeed, under my base assumptions, I estimate that the nationwide average per member per month premium in the individual market would fall by 4.3% in 2019 in a stable policy environment,\" Fiedler wrote.\n\nPrices are still much higher than just a few years ago\n\nBreaking down the last five years of premium jumps, the large shifts in cost across the US are obvious:\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nSince 2014, three states have seen premiums for benchmark plans increase by more than 200% \u2014 Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Iowa \u2014 while 20 states have seen an increase of at least 100%.\n\nAdditionally, only two states have seen premiums go up by only single digits: Indiana (the lowest increase at 3.35%) and New Jersey (8.98%).", "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is having a particularly hard year.\n\n\"This year felt like five years of aging, frankly. The worst year of my entire career,\" Musk said in a new interview with Recode's Kara Swisher.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for that, but prime among them is the absurd hours he puts in at Tesla: upwards of 120 hours per week, and an average of 100-hours per week throughout the year.\n\n\"I haven't counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week,\" he said. \"Some of those must have been 120 hours, or something nutty.

When pushed, Musk reiterated: \"There wasn't some other way to do this, Kara.\"\n\nThat said, it sounds like those kinds of hours have shrunk back to slightly more reasonable levels as Model 3 production has reached internal targets. \"Now we're down to 80 or 90.

Currently, every company has to track transactions individually to identify fraudulent activity. This means a cybercriminal that is already flagged by one company may not be on another's radar. By sharing fraudulent activity information as it gets discovered, financial institutions (FIs) could prevent future fraudulent attacks.\n\nShared platforms can enhance the customer experience by standardizing processes. Developing a standard for KYC processes that can be shared across the industry would significantly reduce onboarding times, as well as administrative costs for FIs. Additionally, this would enable customers to switch between different providers more easily, increasing competition.\n\nThey would make it easier for FIs to understand regulatory changes. Reporting regulatory changes on a shared platform would allow FIs to see all applicable amendments in one place, making it easier to generate best practices for regulatory reporting. This would help FIs to remain compliant.", "Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and celebrity entrepreneur, recently took some time out of his busy schedule boosting Model 3 production and running SpaceX to sit down with Recode's Kara Swisher for an hourlong interview.\n\nThough he didn't smoke weed this time, he did blow some figurative smoke at Apple, Tesla's Silicon Valley neighbor and a company that Tesla is frequently compared to, even if their financial situations are worlds apart.\n\nAfter explaining that Tesla aims to make a car that makes people really happy, Musk said: \"There's not many products you can buy that really make you happier. And so Apple did that for a long time. I still think, obviously, that Apple makes great phones.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I still use an iPhone and everything. But Apple used to really bring out products that would blow people's minds, you know?

But employees go back and forth between the companies all the time. In August, Doug Field, a former Tesla engineering executive who oversaw Model 3 production, ended up back at Apple.\n\nMusk may be tapping into a growing view of Apple products.

When the less expensive iPhone XR \u2014 the \"Model 3\" to the iPhone XS's \"Model S\" \u2014 was released a month later, there were no lines at all.\n\nStill, Apple would probably argue that \"running to the store\" doesn't accurately capture consumer interest for the iPhone; on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday, the company pointed to a smaller survey that found customer satisfaction with the iPhone was 98%.\n\nBut that criticism may sting a little bit more coming from a Silicon Valley legend making cars that Apple's own employees love.\n\nYou can listen to the entire interview over at Recode.", "Sally Boyle attributes much of her career success to having some \"fantastic\" managers. \"They knew to spend time with me, understanding what would really light my fire and what would make me succeed.\"\n\nBoyle is now the international head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, and she shared this observation recently during a discussion on inclusion and diversity, part of the company's global speaker series.\n\nBoyle's best advice for managers is based on her own experience.\n\n\"The best way to be inclusive is to really know your people,\" she said, \"to know every single person that works for you and know what makes them tick, what opportunities they might want, what they need to get better at, what feedback they need to have.\"\n\nTo be sure, this is much harder than it sounds.

The story of a young woman dealing with the unexpected death of her husband moved critics, with The Atlantic calling it \"funny and candid and wrenching right from the start.\"\n\nAnd even before the show launched, its trailer had already inspired Facebook users to post their own stories of grief and loss, an element of social sharing that demonstrated the unique position of Facebook as a TV platform.\n\nThese early signs of success were no doubt a relief for the show's star Elizabeth Olsen, who had spent over three years deeply involved in the project and was paid $250,000 an episode, according to Variety. She had starred in movies, but it was was her first TV show, and it had taken a leap from Showtime (at one point in development) to a largely untested Facebook.\n\nThe first episode got 4 million views, according to Facebook's count, which, despite Facebook \"views\" registering after only three seconds, is impressive.\n\nBut since its debut, \"Sorry for Your Loss\" has so far proved another flop for Watch, which hasn't scored a scripted breakout hit similar to \"House of Cards\" (Netflix), \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (Hulu), or even \"Cobra Kai\" (YouTube's \"Karate Kid\" series reboot).\n\nA nosedive from 4 million to 82,000\n\nFacebook had an atypical release strategy for \"Sorry for Your Loss,\" dropping four of its 30-minute episodes on September 18 and the rest in pairs. Though this is not the norm for either traditional TV or streamers like Netflix, Facebook plans to experiment with similarly irregular blocks of episode releases for coming shows.\n\nConsisting of 10 episodes, the first season of \"Sorry for Your Loss\" ended October 9 (though all episodes are still available to watch on the platform).\n\nThe second episode saw a stark decline in views from the first, falling to under 200,000 (from 4 million). The episode with the fewest views was episode six, which has received about 82,000. But generally, the distribution of viewing has been choppy, suggesting some of these episodes either made their way into people's feeds or got better placement from Facebook some other way.\n\nYou can see each episode's performance in this chart:\n\nBusiness Insider / Olivia Reaney\n\nIn its Watch shows, Facebook has been looking for ones that build a repeat audience. One Watch partner told Business Insider that Facebook would prefer lower view counts if they were stable. The irregularity and nosedive in viewership for \"Sorry for Your Loss\" means that by Facebook's standards, the show appears to have been a flop so far.\n\nFacebook pushed back on that narrative, however.\n\n\"It is still early, but we are excited about the momentum around the series after its short four-week season run and are encouraged by the loyal fan base and community engagement around the show \u2014 as well as within the official Facebook Group,\" a Facebook representative said.\n\nBut while the Facebook group around the show has prompted meaningful discussion about loss, it has fewer than 8,000 members. And the distribution of the views does not suggest the show is gaining momentum.\n\nSo you have a movie star, incredible reviews, prerelease buzz, and then \u2014 a fizzle?\n\nFacebook doesn't even have a Roku app\n\nHollywood is tricky, and some TV series that seem to have all the right parts just fail to build an audience. That's show business.\n\nBut Facebook also doesn't seem to understand some pieces of making a hit TV show in 2018.\n\nHere's a personal anecdote. The day it was released, I was excited to check out \"Sorry for Your Loss.\" I fired up my Roku-powered smart TV to try to watch episode one. Then it turned out there was no Roku app for Facebook (or Facebook Watch). Facebook has ignored the leading streaming player. I spent 20 minutes poking around the internet trying to figure out a workaround but eventually gave up trying to get it on my TV.\n\nI watched episode one on my phone and liked it, but I didn't want to watch a second \u2014 primarily because of the annoyance of having to watch a show on my phone for an extended period. I never came back to it.\n\nIf Facebook wants to force me to watch TV-length shows on my phone, that's fine. But Facebook does have Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV apps, so it doesn't seem as if that's part of a coherent strategy. Facebook didn't provide a specific explanation of why a Roku app was unavailable over a year after the launch of Watch.\n\nCelebs and a 'unique people-centric experience'\n\nFacebook has switched up its Watch strategy a few times since launch.\n\nIn June, Facebook Watch rolled out news programming (which Business Insider is a partner on). The Watch team has also begun leaning in to shows featuring high-profile celebrities with baked-in followings, a Watch partner told Business Insider. Digiday reported Wednesday that Facebook had referred to these celeb vehicles as \"hot start\" shows, using the example of Jada Pinkett Smith's \"Red Table Talk.\"\n\nOn Facebook's earnings call Tuesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said \"while Watch is now growing very quickly, we're well behind YouTube and still working to make this a unique people-centric experience.\"\n\nIt sounds as if Zuckerberg is acknowledging Watch hasn't found its groove. And a lean-back experience on a TV may have always been a tough sell for Facebook, which Zuckerberg noted wants \"people-centric\" viewing.\n\n\"Sorry for Your Loss\" may simply be caught in an awkward spot. While Facebook could have been intrigued by its social aspects \u2014 such as its users supporting one another and sharing stories of loss \u2014 it's fundamentally a TV show.

The tech giant said it sold 46.9 million iPhones, which was up 0.4% versus a year ago but shy of the 48.4 million that Wall Street analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting. Apple also said it would no longer reveal unit sales for its hardware. Apple said it expected to generate revenue of $89 billion to $93 billion during the holiday quarter, a number on the low end of the $92.74 billion that analysts were hoping for. The company reported earnings of $2.91 a share, easily beating the $2.78 that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting. Revenue rose 19.6% year-over-year to $62.9 billion, outpacing the $61.44 billion that was anticipated. Shares plunged more than 7% in after-hours trading to $206.30 apiece. Any print below $207.45 during Friday's session would cost Apple its $1 trillion valuation. While Wall Street analysts were disappointed about Apple's decision to withhold unit sales for hardware, they remained mostly bullish on the tech giant. Here is what Wall Street analysts are saying about the quarter:\n\nJefferies - 'We believe AAPL intends to tell a compelling Services story' AP Price target: $265 Rating: Buy \"AAPL will stop disclosing unit sales figures next qtr, fueling fears the company has something to hide,\" the Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea said in a note. \"But AAPL will disclose Services gross margin for the first time ever, a potential catalyst for the stock. We believe AAPL intends to tell a compelling Services story, which we believe has 2x higher gross margin than hardware and improving.\"\n\nRBC Capital Markets - 'The bull thesis is more diluted' YouTube/MKBHD Price target: $240 (from $250) Rating: Outperform \"AAPL reported modest upside to Sept-qtr results with no notable slowdown from China as better iPhone ASP's and stable GM's enabled revenue and EPS upside vs. expectations,\" RBC's Amit Daryanani said. \"The disappointment from this print will be A) their decision to stop providing iPhone units/ASP information going forward and B) Dec-qtr gross-margin guide was underwhelming vs. expectations given memory tailwinds.\" Daryanani added: \"We are sticking with our OP rating, but concede the bull thesis is more diluted given risk that AAPL's desire to stop providing iPhone unit disclosures is an attempt to hide unit declines going forward (will take a while to prove/disprove this).\"\n\nWedbush - A 'Houdini-like metrics move' Jeff Zelevansky/Reuters Price target: $310 Rating: Outperform \"Last night Apple delivered FY4Q (Sept.) results which beat the Street from a headline number but slightly missed iPhone unit shipments which was the focus of investors,\" the Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote. \"However the quarter itself took a back seat to the modestly softer December guidance that Cook & Co. gave on the heels of its much anticipated XS/XR iPhone product cycle which remains the linchpin of the Apple story for FY19. That said, the 'jaw dropper' last night was when Apple announced it will stop providing units/ASPs for iPhones, Macs and its other product lines. The Street will find this a tough pill to swallow this morning as the transparency of the Cupertino story takes a major dent given that tracking iPhone units has become habitual to any investor that has closely followed the Apple story for the last decade+ and is critical to the thesis.\" He added: \"While last night's 'Houdini-like metrics move' was a stunner, our core bullish thesis on Apple remains unchanged despite the noise this morning. We maintain our OUTPERFORM rating and $310 price target.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs - 'Apple is seeing better price elasticity at higher price points' Kif Leswing Price target: $222 Rating: Neutral \"The midpoint of FQ1'19 (Dec'18 QTR) revenue guidance at $91bn (range: $89bn-$93bn) missed our estimate by 4.3% and FactSet consensus by 2.1%, gross margin at 38.3% (range: 38.0%-38.5%) came in 0.1pp below our estimate and 0.3pp below consensus,\" the Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall said in a note. \"The implied FQ1'19 EPS at $4.54 (range: $4.36-$4.72) missed our estimate by 10.1% and cons by 7.7%. We believe consumer weakness in markets such as Turkey, Russia, India, Brazil and possibly China is driving the weaker guidance. Turkey, Russia, India and Brazil alone contributed 6% of total iPhone units in FQ1'18.\" He added: \"We believe Apple is seeing better price elasticity at higher price points as its sticky base of users are willing to pay up for more features. Should Apple find even more expensive features to add to its devices that it believes add value for users we think they would not hesitate to increase high end device prices further.\"", "Hackers stole the private Facebook messages of over 81,000 accounts, a BBC investigation has revealed.\n\nThe hackers posted ads, one of which was spotted by the BBC on an English language web forum, offering to sell access to people's accounts for 10 cents each.\n\nThe BBC discovered the ad in September, which claimed: \"We sell personal information of Facebook users.

For Republicans, Mueller is entirely absent, with their preferred issues centering on topics such as immigration.\n\nThe special counsel investigation is not a high priority for voters\n\nThe reality, according to one Republican operative, is that most average American voters that campaigns are looking to court do not particularly care about the investigation that has consumed Washington for the past year and a half.\n\n\"I think you'd be really surprised as how little of what we get caught up in actually registers with these voters in these states and the numbers,\" the GOP operative, who requested anonymity to talk about internal deliberations, told Business Insider.\n\nThe operative noted that broader themes like the economy or localized issues are more effective targets.\n\n\"The things we generally find that resonate with voters are not like 24-hour issues,\" the operative said.\n\nFor Democrats, too, one campaign operative described the Mueller probe as \"distracting\" from issues that voters actually care about. The status of a secretive investigation involving a large set of government figures is \"not a primary concern\" among average families, they added.\n\nAnd the idea that voters care more about kitchen table issues is reflected in polling as well.

Hospital care cost about $1.1 trillion in 2016 \u2014 that's 32% of health spending in the US.\n\n\"We do a lot of very expensive things,\" Corwin told Business Insider. \"We have to figure out how to reduce our costs.\"\n\nSeemingly every day, there are new headlines about unexpected hospital bills charging anywhere from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Often, it's hard to know what you might be on the hook for paying, and hospitals aren't always able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to give you an estimate. Numerous variables contribute to a hospital bill, including the type of health plan a person has.\n\nIdeally, one way to bring down spending on hospital care would be to prevent trips to the hospital in the first place, with preventive care like check-ups and screenings. But to make that happen, people need to be covered by health insurance, Corwin said.\n\n\"We have to have universal coverage,\" Corwin said. \"Let's forget the mechanism of getting universal coverage, but I think everybody's gotta be insured.\"\n\nOn the national stage, Democrats have been embracing \"Medicare for All,\" a form of universal healthcare that would expand the federally funded Medicare program, which today covers healthcare for seniors 65 and older, to all Americans.\n\nWhile Corwin doesn't support Medicare for All, it's a concept he has on his mind, in part because of how much simpler what is known as a single-payer system would be on the administrative side of the hospital. Instead of worrying about the variability in different plans, hospitals would have only one plan to keep in mind.\n\nBut to him, there are two big questions around Medicare for All:\n\nLogistically, what's the tax structure the US would need to support that?\n\nDoes Medicare for All makes sense for the US as a country?\n\n\"I think we should have that debate,\" Corwin said.", "Armed police are responding to a stabbing at Sony's office in London which has injured two people.\n\nOne person has been arrested, the Metropolitan Police said.

He even posted a statement on Instagram claiming the fight could attract 100,000 spectators to the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and generate \"a world record for the sale of paid broadcasts.\"\n\nBut a boxing-rules contest is something White has refused to entertain. White has already sent one of his athletes to the boxing ring for a fight against Mayweather, when McGregor lost a 10th-round stoppage in 2017. Because of this, he wants to bring Mayweather into the UFC, for a fight using mixed-martial-arts rules.\n\nWhite said earlier in the week that if Mayweather wanted to fight, he had to fight a \"real fight\"\u2014 a real fight meaning a UFC bout, not one in which combatants are barred from kicking, wrestling, or choking each other.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to happen,\" he told ESPN. \"I don't think the fight would happen in the UFC, but they didn't say no.\"\n\nHe added: \"We went over there, we boxed him, and if he wants to do it again, he's gotta come fight in the UFC.

Speaking on Friday, the MP for Hastings & Rye said she regretted that the report was \"sat on\" for nearly 6 months.\n\nHere is the report's executive summary in full:\n\nSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report has been produced in response to Sir Philip Rutnam's request to undertake a fact finding review into the circumstances surrounding the former Home Secretary's evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on 25 April 2018.\n\nPreparations before the hearing\n\nThe written and oral briefing sessions before the hearing did not cover the issue of removals targets. I do not find that surprising given the focus was on Windrush children and the issue of removals targets had not been raised in previous statements and questions. Nonetheless, as events showed, officials should have been better prepared to answer questions when the issue was raised.\n\nSupport during the hearing\n\nIn preparations immediately before the hearing, the Home Secretary asked \"are there removals targets\" and was told \"no\". That led to her firm denial (\"we do not have targets for removals\") in the hearing. I cannot establish how she was given this reply: the most likely explanation is crossed wires between her special adviser and her private office. During the session before hers, an official sitting in on that hearing spotted the questioning about removals targets and emailed the team with the Home Secretary. The import of this was missed due to misunderstandings amid the pressures of dealing with other urgent issues. The opportunity to alert the Home Secretary was therefore missed. After the Home Secretary had given her answer in the hearing, there were confused email exchanges trying to establish the position on targets. The initial line that there were indeed no targets was undermined when it emerged that there had been a target until a few weeks previously. It proved impossible to establish a clear answer on whether targets had been allocated out regionally. The Home Secretary (and Glyn Williams who was appearing with her) were never provided with briefing that might have allowed them to put the correct position on the record.\n\nThe Home Secretary was not, therefore, supported as she should have been during the hearing.\n\nAfter the hearing\n\nThe Home Secretary returned to her room in the House of Commons after the hearing. Hugh Ind was put on speaker-phone to explain the position. He initially repeated the line that there were currently no targets, but, when pressed, was not able to bring clarity to the issues being raised. The Home Secretary became frustrated at not getting clear answers.\n\nFollowing further email exchanges that failed to clear up the position, the Immigration Enforcement team was tasked with producing chapter and verse on targets and the history. They worked through the night, and produced a note which took the position forward but left several questions unanswered.\n\nThe Urgent Question\n\nBy now, the Home Secretary and her special advisers had lost confidence in the official advice coming forward. An Urgent Question had been put down for that morning, and she and her advisers worked on her answer without officials present. This was dangerous, and though the UQ session went well in the House, the answer did not deal with the issues around targets as clearly as it could have done. For the first time, she said she had not been aware of targets.\n\nThe leak to the Guardian and the Home Secretary's tweets\n\nAfter a quieter 24 hours, the press office was told that the Guardian had a leaked submission, copied to the Home Secretary, which referred to targets for enforced removals. The special advisers discussed with the Home Secretary how to deal with this. She was adamant that she had not seen the document and had not been aware of targets. The special advisers drafted tweets to say this, which were shown to her private secretary. He agreed them on the basis that standard private office practice made it most unlikely she would have seen the document. He felt the question whether she was aware of targets was a question for her - though there had not, at that stage, been a full trawl of documents she might have seen and which would have cast doubt on her assertion. This was risky, but I accept that, given her earlier public statements and assertions, there was little alternative to the line in the tweets.\n\nPossible misconduct\n\nI was asked to make recommendations as to whether investigations into potential misconduct by specific employees should be undertaken. For reasons set out in the report, I do not recommend any such investigations. I do, however, criticise Hugh Ind for less than satisfactory performance in his role as Director General for Immigration Enforcement. And I would have expected Patsy Wilkinson, as a permanent secretary, and the line manager of someone who was clearly in an exposed position, to play a more proactive role.", "Apple announced Thursday night that it would no longer be reporting iPhone sales numbers\u2014 or sales numbers for any of its products \u2014 on future earnings calls. Investors hated it: AAPL stock tanked 7% on the news in after-hours trading and was still down 5% in premarket trading before the New York exchanges opened Friday.\n\nThe disclosure can only be interpreted negatively. The Citi analyst Jim Suva summed it up perfectly on the earnings call Thursday night. He told CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri:\n\n\"Some people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are going to start going negative year-over-year because it's easier to talk about great things and not show the details of things that aren't so great.\"\n\nIn a later note to clients, Suva said that the move \"left investors speechless\" and that \"some investors will view this as a negative that the company is trying to hide information that in the past was so important to assess the company's strength.\"\n\nFriday morning, Walt Piecyk, the respected tech analyst at BTIG Research, agreed. He told the Financial Times, \"It's certainly not a good look for Apple in the eyes of consumers when analysts are quoting ASPs,\" the average sales prices, \"that are rising by double digits.\"\n\n\"By not reporting units,\" he added, \"it effectively removes the discussion of rising prices from mainstream media stories.\"\n\nRead more: Tim Cook admitted Tuesday night that smartphone sales might shrink and, significantly, that he's OK with it\n\nIf Apple is worried the iPhone is entering a decline, then not reporting its sales numbers helps it avoid that negative PR. On Friday, many analysts openly worried in notes to clients that the move was an indicator that iPhone growth was over and that negative unit sales growth lay ahead.\n\nThere is almost no other way to interpret the move\n\nOn the call, Cook and Maestri tried to explain that they believed unit sales had become less important than total dollar revenue. There is some logic to this. In recent years, especially since the iPhone X was introduced, Apple has increased its revenue largely by raising the price of the iPhone, not by selling more phones. Actual sales have barely moved. This set of numbers from Thursday night's earnings tells the tale: dollars are going up but actual products are flat or in decline:\n\nApple said Thursday night that it would no longer be reporting these numbers. Apple\n\nCook and Maestri tried to convince analysts that Apple's other lines of business were increasingly important. Sales of \"Services\" \u2014 the App Store and other paid software downloads \u2014 increased by 17%, for instance. And, Cook said, the \"installed base\" of existing iPhones had become so big that it was more important for sales than the much smaller number of new units they sell every 90 days. The installed base is what is driving Services sales. People own an iPhone for years, and they continually pay to download music and apps. That is Apple's growth business now.\n\n\"Our installed base is growing at double digits,\" Cook said. \"And that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and the customer loyalty, etc.\"\n\nNotably, Cook did not promise to replace the unit-sales stat with a new stat on the size of the total installed base.\n\nSo, that's Apple's case.\n\nCook has all but acknowledged the iPhone is in decline\n\nBut here is the grim reality Cook did not talk about: The iPhone is most likely entering a decline. We know this because Cook came close to saying it on his previous earnings call, when he said of the smartphone market: \"It's an enormous sized market and whether it grows, from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. And so that's kind of the way that I view that.\"\n\nMore objectively, smartphone sales data has been signalling the decline of the iPhone for years. The global context is that the iPhone rarely gets better sales than the smartphone market as a whole, and the smartphone market as whole is slowing down \u2014 implying that the iPhone will too.\n\niPhone sales growth generally underperforms the market as a whole. Deutsche Bank / IDC\n\nAnalysts hate it\n\nAnalysts will hate this. Like it or not, the iPhone accounts for 59% of Apple's revenue. Apple is the iPhone company, by definition. So when the company moves to conceal how the iPhone is doing, that's bad.\n\nOn Friday morning, the Wedbush analysts Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe called the pullback a \"jaw dropper\" and \"frustrating.\" \"The Street will find this a tough pill to swallow this morning as the transparency of the Cupertino story takes a major dent,\" they said, adding, \"The skeptics will point to Apple doing this right at the critical juncture where higher ASPs are making up for slower unit sales.\"\n\nSimilarly, Nomura's Jeffrey Kvaal and his team stuck the knife in. \"We do not find Apple's rationale for the reduced disclosure well considered,\" they said. \"We disagree with Apple's view that a unit of sale is less relevant; on the contrary, we consider it an indicator of the health and growth of the ecosystem.\"\n\nThey added: \"Consumers are not choosing a range of different iPhones at different price points like items in a shopping cart. Consumers are choosing only one iPhone; we care how much they pay.\"\n\nGuggenheim's Robert Cihra and Amil Patel said, \"We think investors will dislike it as it could foreshadow trying to hide unit declines.\"\n\nAnd Ben Schachter of Macquarie added, \"Long time AAPL watchers will clearly be disappointed by this and the assumption is that units are very likely to turn negative for the near-mid-term and that is why AAPL is making the disclosure change.\"\n\nAlthough Apple is getting increased revenue from iPhone, its unit sales are flat. Statista\n\nSome analysts have already hinted they no longer trust Apple\n\nSome analysts have signaled in the past that they no longer trust Apple's numbers. In 2016, Ben Thompson of Stratechery and the Pacific Crest analysts Andy Hargreaves and Evan Wingren all said they thought Apple's description of some iPhone sales metrics were misleading.\n\nAnd in 2014, Barclays' Ben Reitzes had the temerity to ask Cook, \"Are you still a growth company?\" \u2014 implying that Apple had lost the ability to increase the market for iPhone.\n\nNow we may have an answer to that question. The iPhone has reached a peak, and Apple wants to leave it at that.", "Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nTrump is reportedly ready to back down in his trade war with China.

It's one that, unsurprisingly, involves leaning into the negative trend seen across the market during much of October.\n\nGoldman's strategy is as follows: An investor buys the closest out-of-the-money, one-month listed put contract on a stock five days before earnings. Then, one day after the report, the investor closes the trade. (Note: A put contract is a wager that a stock will fall.)\n\nOn an average basis, the trade has returned a whopping 107%.

Four soldiers were also killed.\n\nThe violence represented a \"tremendous shock\" and a \"key moment\" for France, French historian Isabelle Merle said. \"This is the first time a carefully thought-through peaceful decolonization process has been considered,\" she said.\n\nThe Ouvea events prompted a peace deal that year between rival loyalist and pro-independence factions that laid the ground for the referendum.\n\nVisiting the territory in May, French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged the \"pain of colonization\" and paid tribute to the courage of those involved in the peace process.\n\nHe also handed the Caledonian government a document that stated the archipelago became a French possession in 1853 \u2014 a gesture intended to symbolize the final chapter in the period of colonization.\n\n\"We are no longer in a time of possession, but a time of choice\", he said.\n\nUnder French colonial rule, the Kanaks were forced to live on reserves in remote areas, pay specific taxes and do mandatory work for very low wages. They had to respect curfews and were not allowed into some places reserved for European settlers.\n\nMerle, whose researches focus on France's decolonization process, said this led to \"a big gap between the local communities.\"\n\n\"In the whole French colonial emprise, the Kanaks have probably been those who have been despised the most, in the sense that they were seen as savages,\" she said.\n\nToday the Kanaks represent about 40 percent of New Caledonia's population, while people of European descent make up about 27 percent. Others include those who emigrated from Asia and other Pacific islands.\n\nLong used as a prison colony, New Caledonia remains an important part of France's overseas holdings that stretch from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean and the northeast coast of Canada.\n\nTogether, they enable France to lay claim to the world's second largest maritime domain \u2014 the area within 200 nautical miles from the coast in which each country is sovereign and can exploit natural resources \u2014 almost equivalent to that of the United States.\n\nNew Caledonia's turquoise lagoons are a tourism magnet, and its mines contain a quarter of the world's known nickel supplies, a metal used in electronics manufacturing and many other industries.\n\nBut like other French overseas territories, the territory suffers from much higher unemployment and poverty than in the mainland, and many residents share a feeling of being neglected by Paris.\n\nFrench overseas economies are largely dependent on the French state. France's global budget for overseas amounts to 17 billion euros ($19,3 billion) this year, including 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for New Caledonia, according to a Senate report.\n\nOnce the second largest colonial empire in the world after Britain, French power had extended to west and north Africa, southeast Asia and islands in the Caribbean, Indian and Pacific Ocean, reaching its height between the World Wars. In 1939, five percent of the world's population was living under French rule.\n\nMost of France's African and Asian colonies broke free in the 1950s and 1960s. The vote in New Caledonia is the first time a self-determination referendum is being held on a French territory since Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, voted for independence in 1977.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe will travel to New Caledonia the day after the vote to discuss the archipelago's future with local politicians.\n\nWhatever the referendum's result, Merle said pro-independence Kanaks will keep pushing for New Caledonia to be its own country.", "LONDON \u2014 Boris Johnson has told friends he has \"given up hope\" of becoming Conservative leader due to fears that he would come a humiliating fourth or fifth place.\n\nThe former foreign secretary was earlier this year the clear bookies' favourite to succeed Theresa May as party leader and prime minister.\n\nHowever, his support among Conservative MPs has plummeted following his resignation as foreign secretary and subsequent attacks on May, including the suggestions that she had put a \"suicide vest\" around Britain and should be prosecuted for betraying the country in Brexit negotiations.\n\nNow friends of Johnson have told The Sun that he may not even enter the next race for Conservative leader.\n\n\"If Boris think the chances are against him, he won't go for it.

Let's call it 'the Chinese Alternative,'\" Rudd said.\n\nSpeaking at the Hudson Institute earlier this month, Pence directly accused China of 'meddling in America's democracy,' through a sophisticated and elaborately planned whole-of-government approach to interfere in US domestic politics.\n\nIn a no-holds-barred speech, Pence accused China of stealing American intellectual property, of trying to dominate 90% of the world's most \u00adadvanced industries, eroding US military positions, and driving the US out of the Western Pacific.\n\nPence surprised many observers by slamming China's militarization of the contested areas in the South and East China Sea, its practice of what he described as \"debt diplomacy\" in developing countries, as well as its ongoing and relentless pursuit of isolating its \"rogue province,\" Taiwan.\n\nPence said China had betrayed US hopes that it would open up and liberalize. And that was that.\n\n\"In terms of the harshness of the language, I think, again, it will cause Beijing to sit up and take notice, and it will confirm in the minds of many that the impending unfolding period of US containment of China is now entrenched,\" Rudd said.\n\nEveryone agrees: That's a dead policy walking\n\nOr in other, less-Ruddesque language: the US has made its decision to confront and no longer condone Chinese assertiveness around the world.\n\nRudd, who first rose to power in 2007 on Australia's China-driven trade tsunami and the memorable Kevin'07 campaign slogan said that, since December 2017, the decades-long US policy of strategic engagement, most recently vigorously championed by the former US president Barack Obama, has been well and truly \"interred\" and been replaced with a direct strategic competition \u2014 and no one has even blinked.\n\n\"What I've noticed is that no one from the Democratic side has opposed it,\" he said.\n\nNot Democrats, not Congress, not large American corporations or think tanks or policy wonks or academics.\n\n\"By and large there hasn't been much blowback against that direction and that caught Beijing's attention.\"\n\nA tale of two presidents\n\nIn between throwing out the diplomatic dictionary and shaking up bilateral ties, Trump has repeatedly made a point of referring to China's Xi Jinping as a \"friend.\"\n\nAnd while they are far apart in many ways, these leaders share certain qualities. They see themselves in history, they see their countries as exceptional, they see themselves surrounded, and they see themselves as agents of change and they see their countries as direct competitors.\n\nBoth have invested enormous national pride in themselves and will have difficulty stepping back from conflict, if it means losing national face.\n\nXi is a meticulous planner, removing obstacles and enemies before they see him coming. Trump is a master of improvisation and misdirection, sometimes it feels like he doesn't even see himself coming.\n\nOn Thursday, he wrote on Twitter, as he does, to announce a \"very good\" conversation with Xi, suggesting friendly progress had been made across several of the issues the US has taken up, including the ongoing trade dispute and North Korean talks.\n\n\"Just had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade,\" Trump wrote. \"Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina. Also had good discussion on North Korea!\"\n\nThe positive, sparky tone brings into stark relief the escalating trade realities on the ground that have shaved billions off both economies and has been overshadowing a planned sit-down at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Argentina later in November.\n\nA few hours after the president's tweet, US prosecutors began executing a series of charges against Chinese nationals and a Chinese tech firm for allegedly stealing US corporate secrets.\n\nThe message, to anyone hopelessly trying to read the tea leaves, are either very complex and nuanced or perhaps this is just what the new diplomacy in an age where the rules have not yet been written, and there is an absence of any meaning at all.\n\nA new world disorder\n\nRudd says that if 40 years of strategic engagement are done and dusted, so then are all the complex rules, protocols, habits, the cultures, the diplomatic intimations that have evolved and been taken on by participants, \"through a process of osmosis.\"\n\n\"2018's a big year, the US has proclaimed that era is over,\" Rudd said.\n\nThe common language of Sino-US diplomacy, spoken by luminaries from Zhou Enlai to Henry Kissinger has been thrown out.\n\n\"And in this new period of strategic competition what are the rules? And in the absence of rules are we now going to watch this relationship career in multiple directions? How is it going to run in the absence of automatic, as it were, assumptions about how far can you push the trade war? How far can you push economic relations?\"\n\n\"How far can we now push incidents and near misses in the South China Sea ... etcetera.\"\n\nIn this period both for China and the US, is it now a free-for-all or are we now ... on more of a gradual gliding path from competition to confrontation to conflict?\"\n\nCertainly, in the face of a passive West, brow-beaten by economic failures and political stalemates, the Chinese model of authoritarian capitalism is being emboldened.\n\nConcealing one's strength and biding one's time\n\nAnd for the first time since Mao Zedong, many observers from within and without see China helmed by a virtuoso leader, who has ruthlessly and efficiently shored up power and removed many of its previous checks and balances, including two-term limitations on the office of the president.\n\nRudd became prime minister the year that Xi Jinping was anointed as Hu Jintao's successor in Beijing, 2007.\n\nXi, he says \u2014 calling it political intuition \u2014 is a man with a sense of a historic mission and the party, sharing his accumulation of strength, is and will behave on the world stage with ever-increasing assertiveness.\n\n\"Given the power consolidation process of first term Xi Jinping has been achieved with comprehensive success \u2014 it hasn't turned out well for those who opposed him \u2014 its fair to conclude \u2026 that Xi Jinping's worldview and that of the party more broadly is synchronous.\"\n\nRudd describes the historic turnaround in foreign policy under Xi as ditching China's favourite fallback position first articulated under Deng Xiaoping: \"conceal one's strengths and bide one's time\" (\u97ec\u5149\u517b\u6666 tao guang yang hua) to an approach that seizes the initiative when the opportunity arises: \"rouse oneself and press on\" (\u594b\u53d1\u6709\u4e3a fen fa you wei), a strategy that has seen China more willing to act outside the global forums that the US is itself apparently dismantling.\n\n\"I think the one thing I probably got right about Xi Jinping was an estimation of his character and personality. That he would not be content with being primus inter pares (first among equals).\"\n\nXi has a sense of historical mission, Rudd says. Something that might also be said of his US counterpart.\n\nAnd history, China is starting to believe, is on its side.\n\n\"The Western condition generally at present \u2014 for which Trump is not particularly to blame \u2014 is in a bad state ... China's response to that over the last decade-plus has been a state of heightening encouragement ... that their own authoritarian capitalist project can prevail not just at home, but also possibly as a model to emulate from abroad as well.\"\n\nSo, actually, it's pretty desperate days already\n\nRudd says for the liberal world order to survive, nations currently anesthetized by the comforts of free speech, a cracking press and the warm embrace of democratic norms are going to have to rouse themselves off the couch.\n\n\"I think the other member states of the international community, if they want the current rules-based order based on its established pillars to survive, they're going to have to argue for it and argue strongly for it and argue with passion and commitment for it.\n\n\"Otherwise, it will disappear beneath the waves of an economically dominant China over the long term.\"\n\n\"If nation-states around the world think an authoritarian capitalist model is better and people are passive to the international challenge to those norms ... then the Chinese way may well prevail,\" Rudd warned.\n\nSo, its time to wake up and smell the communism, Kevin?\n\n\"The sooner people are aware of that the better.\"", "Hello!

Troy Wolverton/Business Insider Thousands of Google employees at offices around the globe walked out of their offices on Thursday morning to protest the company's treatment of women and its handling of sexual harassment allegations. Among those who joined in the protest were hundreds of employees at the company's headquarters here.\n\nOn a bright and sunny day here, Googlers crowded a main plaza on campus and heard from numerous colleagues who talked about their experiences with sexual harassment and called for change. Many of those present wore teal ribbons in solidarity with those who had experienced sexual harassment. \"Time's up,\" some shouted. \"Enough is enough!\"\n\n\"There are so many of these stories we've heard for so long,\" said Celie O'Neil-Heart, who helped organize the walkout. \"It's time for action and change \u2014 real change.\"\n\nIn an appearance at a conference in New York, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he shared protesters anger and frustration and echoed their call for change.\n\n\"Words alone aren't enough, you have to follow up with actions,\" he said.\n\nRevelations about Andy Rubin's severance sparked the protest\n\nMany Googlers brought signs to the Mountain View walkout protesting the company's handling of sexual misconduct allegations. Troy Wolverton/Business Insider The protests were sparked by a New York Times article last week that detailed the company's handling of sexual misconduct allegations against three prominent men. The report revealed that Google paid Andy Rubin, who helped invent the Android operating system, a $90 million severance package when he left the company, despite the fact that a sexual misconduct allegation had been made against him that the company found \"credible.\"\n\nThe revelation of the payout to Rubin was \"the $90 million straw that broke the camel's back,\" O'Neil-Heart said.\n\nOrganizers of the protest have been collecting stories from employees about sexual harassment and other issues they've faced at the company, some of which they shared during the protest here. They've also made a list of demands for company management. Among them: that Google should put together a report on sexual harassment at the company and publicly disclose its findings, and that it should end its policy of requiring employees in disputes over sexual harassment and discrimination to pursue them through binding arbitration rather than through the courts.\n\nThe demands aren't just coming from a core group of agitators, O'Neil-Heart said. Instead, they represent longstanding desires by \"hundreds\" of employees.\n\nRead more: Google's recent behavior shows the troubling reality of an internet superpower that abandoned its vow to not 'be evil'\n\n\"We're all here representing movements that have been at Google for a long time, asking for these demands for a long time,\" she said.\n\nEmployees shared stories about their experiences with harassment\n\nGoogle employees streamed in by the hundreds to the main plaza on its Mountain View campus to take part in the walkout. Troy Wolverton/Business Insider The protest officially got underway at 11:10 a.m., but employees started showing up well before then and continued to stream into the plaza to take part for even 30 minutes after it started. Some carried signs saying things such as, \"Hey Google, WTF?\" \"Stand Tall, Stand Together, Stand For Change\" and \"Not OK, Google.\"\n\nEmployees generally avoided the press. The company's policy generally requires employees to go through its public relations department before talking to the media. But some did share their thoughts anonymously as they left the protest.\n\n\"It was great,\" said one female Googler. \"It was the start of the movement.\"\n\nThe employees who came forward to share their stories touched a chord with many who were there. O'Neil-Heart, for one said she got \"very emotional\" listening to colleagues tell their stories.\n\n\"I'm proud of all the women who got up there to tell their stories,\" said a another female Googler, who declined to give her name. \"It was moving.\"\n\nFollowing the main protest in the plaza, several dozen organizers and employees marched from there to the public park area just off the company's campus where members of the press were standing. The protestors chanted slogans such as \"Stand up! Fight back!\" and \"What's Googley? This is Googley!\"\n\nOrganizers are demanding \"urgency\"\n\nThe walkout is the latest development in the movement to highlight and combat sexual discrimination in the tech industry and elsewhere.

Not only does the card offer a number of tangible benefits \u2014 including an outstanding 40,000 point sign-up bonus \u2014 but allows for a number of tiered perks based on spending amount.\n\nPerks and rewards of the Southwest Priority Card\n\nThe benefits of the Priority card come in two main forms: tangible monetary rewards and perks.\n\nIn terms of monetary and points-based rewards, there are three main advantages of the card:\n\n40,000 sign-up bonus \u2014 Requiring just $1,000 of spending within the first three months, the Southwest Priority card has one of the best sign-up bonuses of any travel card. Estimates place the value of each Southwest rewards point at between 1.5 and 2 cents each, making this sign-up bonus worth between $600-$800.\n\n$75 in travel credit each year \u2014 This is credited automatically every 12-month billing cycle to the cardholder's account. These points can be used for Southwest flights, but not toward upgrades or in-flight purchases.\n\n7,500 bonus points every year \u2014 On the account anniversary (12 months after the account opens), you get 7,500 rewards points, valued at $125 dollars.\n\nBased just on these bonuses, the Southwest Priority card is worth at minimum roughly $900 in its first year, and $200 each year thereafter. Well worth the $149 sign-up bonus.\n\nThe value only increases as you spend. While you will not get the 2x points on dining that has made the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card hugely popular, you will earn 2x point for every Southwest purchase. This not only includes flights but also Rapid Rewards hotel and car rental partners\u2014 which include Marriott, Best Western, and virtually every major car rental agency. You also earn 20% back on in-flight purchases, including WiFi and meals.\n\nWhen it comes to benefits, there are a few as well:\n\n4 upgraded boardings a year \u2014 Subject to availability, upgraded boardings may be purchased at the departure gate or ticket counter on the day of travel only. While the cost of these upgrades amounts to $120-160, Southwest's budget airline nature means these upgrades are more related to the order of boarding then they are the size of the seat itself.\n\nTravel protections \u2014 As a Visa Signature card, Southwest's Priority card offers auto rental collision damage waiver, baggage delay insurance, lost luggage reimbursement, roadside dispatch, and travel accident insurance.\n\nAs a Visa Signature card, Southwest's Priority card offers auto rental collision damage waiver, baggage delay insurance, lost luggage reimbursement, roadside dispatch, and travel accident insurance. Retail protections \u2014 Extends the time period of the US manufacturer's warranty by an additional year, on eligible warranties of three years or less and covers new purchases for 120 days against damage, or theft up to $500 per claim.\n\nA-list and Companion Pass status\n\nFor those who foresee themselves flying dozens of times a year, the additional benefits of the Southwest Priority card can be tremendously maximized when qualifying for the A-List and Companion Pass statuses.\n\nQualifying for A-List and Companion Pass status are earned through either what's known as \"tier qualifying points,\" or purchase of one-way qualifying Southwest flights.\n\nA-List status requires 35,000 tier-qualifying points, or 25 one-way qualified flights annually, and includes:\n\nPriority boarding\n\nPriority check-in and security lane access (TSA PreCheck)\n\n25% more Rapid Rewards points earned on each flight\n\nFree same-day standby\n\nDedicated A-List member phone line (customer service)\n\nA List isn't hard to earn, as you get tier-qualifying points for all Southwest flights booked and points you earned through purchases with your Priority card (the sign-up bonus doesn't count). You also earn 1,500 tier-qualifying points for every $10,000 spent, up to $100,000 or 15,000 points. If you prefer to earn it through flights, with the average one-way flight price of $250 last year you would qualify for A-List after $6,250 booked in travel.\n\nHowever, for those who are big flyers, and particularly those able to expense flights to their company, it's worth trying to shoot beyond A-List and get Companion Pass, which requires 110,000 qualifying points, or 100 one-way flights in a calendar year. Companion Pass status is a little bit less strict about how you earn points, plus you will be on an earning boost after reaching A-list status.\n\nWhile it's a bit of spending to get the Companion Pass, it's largely worth it as it has the HUGE benefit of letting you fly an additional person with you for free on every Southwest flight. This is arguably the best airline deal out there, and is valued in the thousands of dollars. When Companion Pass status is reached, it's active not just for the remainder of the calendar year, but an additional 12 months after. Which means if you achieve it in January you get 23 months of free flights for a spouse or child.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf your singular focus in a credit card is to earn travel miles, then the Southwest Priority card is one of the best cards available. If you fly frequently (over 50 times a year) and Southwest is your preferred airline, this is with little doubt the best travel card for your money. If you do not fly Southwest, be mindful of where you fly, as they are a smaller, largely domestic airline.\n\nThe 40,000 sign-up bonus is one of the best we've seen, and the annual point bonus and travel credit covers the $149 annual fee. There are no lavish perks or lounge accesses, but with the robust protections of a Visa Signature card, and a very generous earning structure \u2014 including the ability the earn A-List and Companion Pass status \u2014 the Southwest Priority card could save you literally thousands of dollars annually in travel expenses.", "Consider Starbucks' rumored \"war on Christmas\" officially over.\n\nOn Thursday, the coffee giant announced it would be doubling down on festive cheer in 2018, after holiday sales slumped in 2017.\n\n\"Last year, our stores didn't sufficiently reflect the festive environment,\" Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said on a call with investors on Thursday.\n\nStarbucks' US same-store sales fell 2% in the quarter that ended on December 31, 2017, due in large part to the chain's disappointing sales on holiday beverages, merchandise and gift cards.\n\nStarbucks is doubling down on holiday festivities.

In their book \"The Dichotomy of Leadership,\" Willink and Babin describe what it takes to be a good leader, both in the military and in business.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nLeif Babin: Contingency plans, the likely things that might go wrong, those are critical. There's situations where some leaders don't even come up with contingency plans for likely things that are going to happen, and that's a disaster. You can't do that, 'cause then that's gonna set your team up for failure and it's going to certainly impede your ability to accomplish the mission. So what you have to do is balance that, not overplan but have some planning, and what that generally looked like for us in combat was come up with the most likely three or four contingencies that might happen for each phase of an operation.\n\nSo if I'm about to kick off a major operation I'm gonna look at what the first- the one, two, or three things that are likely to go wrong. I'm gonna focus on those things, and then I might plan for that and then I might also plan for that worst case scenario as well. So you think through those things so the team knows how to react to those things, they're prepared to prevent those things from happening or prepared to react to them when they do go wrong. And yet you absolutely can take that too far in the other direction and overplan.\n\nJocko Willink: So let's say a business has a project that they're planning for next quarter. And it's a complicated project. Now they have to do some planning, there's no doubt about it. But we see businesses sometimes where they invest so much time and so much effort into their planning that they actually never make any progress on getting the project done. Or at least they take away from their effort to actually execute the project. So what you have to do is you have to be sensible. What you have to do is you have to find the balance. You certainly have to plan but you can't spend so much time doing your planning that you never get anything actually done.\n\nBabin: One of the first patrols I went out with, with the Marine Corps in a really dangerous area of downtown Ramadi, and when we were going out on this operation we knew we were going to be out there for at least 24 hours, and we knew it could be even longer. So I loaded out for World War III.\n\nI packed extra grenades and extra magazines with rounds and extra water and extra food and batteries and radios and everything that you could possibly imagine to try to cover all these contingencies in the event that we got extended out there, in the event that we were about to be overrun by a larger enemy force. And what that did to me was burden me down to a point where I was so heavy, the weight that I was carrying on my back, in my rucksack that I could barely keep up with the patrol and I certainly couldn't lead that patrol. And that actually put me in a much more dangerous situation because I tried to plan for every single contingency.\n\nSo you can take any of these things too far. You've gotta plan but you can't overplan. Once a decision gets made, you've got to be able to get behind that plan and execute the plan as if it were your own plan. It doesn't matter if you came up with it or if someone else came up with it. If you're a good leader and you see, \"Hey, this person came up with a great idea. Let's give that idea a shot.\" They're in a better position to actually run with that idea. I'm gonna follow and I'm gonna let them lead, because I don't care who gets the credit. I just want the team to win. And the best leaders are going to be able to do that.", "NOW WATCH: How Hollywood makes fake blood for TV and movies", "When traveling during the holiday season, there's always a risk for weather disruptions and flight cancellations.

Throughout the first season, the characters are unable to open a red door when living in the haunted Hill house as children. When they return to the house as adults, they finally discover that they had each actually been in the room countless times, and it acted as their own personal spaces that nobody else could unlock.\n\nFlanagan told The Wrap that to conceal what the Red Room was from viewers, the set was \"constantly refined.\"\n\n\"But we needed one element to be constant so that once the reveal occurred, a second viewing would feel like it was always obvious,\" Flanagan said. \"We chose that distinct vertical window. We also made sure to shoot the room from the same angle in all of the episodes leading up to it, so that even the camera framing was familiar. We really just hoped that Hill House was so sprawling, people would assume there were just a lot of rooms they hadn't seen.

He is in charge of the physical work being done to it, and that gives him a sense of security, comfort, and order. To put him in a position where he is incapable of something as simple as opening a door strikes to the very heart of his confidence as a character. Between that and the mold, I think it erodes his sense of competence, and everything else tumbles for him as a result.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean that Flanagan didn't envision what the room would be like for Hugh, saying that it would have been \"full of tools and other things from his work.\"", "Apple has finally added group video chats to its iPhones and iPads, thanks to an iOS update released Tuesday to devices.\n\nThe group video calling feature is a highly anticipated addition to Apple devices.

Revenue was also up 20% from last year.\n\nApple also highlighted its services revenue, which reached $10 billion. That segment is comprised of fees from companies like Google, revenue from the App Store, and services like iCloud and Apple Music. Apple also noted that it shipped its 2 billionth device running iOS in the past quarter.\n\n\"We are heading in to the holiday quarter with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish on Apple's future,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nAccording to Apple's CFO Luca Maestri, the company spent over $23 billion on dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, bringing Apple's total capital return for its fiscal 2018 to \"almost $90 billion.\"\n\nAnother factor in Apple's slide was that the company announced that it would no longer reveal unit sales for its hardware, which are metrics that investors use to see if Apple's business is growing.\n\nWhile Apple will still report revenue by product line, investors and analysts will now need to estimate total unit sales and average selling price.\n\n\"As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives, and to provide an unparalleled customer experience, so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal, and engaged,\" Maestri said.\n\n\"As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow. As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business,\" he continued.\n\n\"Our installed base is growing at double digits, that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and customer loyalty, et cetera,\" Cook explained.\n\nAt first, investors appeared to be unenthusiastic about yet another quarter where Apple seemed to be wringing more money out of flat sales, with Apple's share price down about 4% after earnings were released.\n\nBut investors seem to have strongly disliked that Apple will limit its unit sales disclosure, and the stock tumbled farther, trading down 7% in after-hours trading.\n\nNotes from Apple's conference call with investors:\n\n6:01: Thanks for tuning in, we're done here!\n\n5:58: Apple won't announce unit sales going forward, bringing the possibility that unit sales are going to go negative. Maestri is taking all unit-oriented questions. \"One of the things we are doing and it's in addition to the information we're going to provide to investor, is starting with December quarter, we're going to be providing information for revenue and cost of sales for both products and services. First time gross margin for services ... We can assure you it's our objective to grow unit sales for every product category we have ... Unit sales for iPhone at top end of line have been very strong for September quarter, we're attracting customers to most recent ... you don't see that in the number that's reported ... we'll provide qualitative commentary when it's relevant ... we make decisions to optimize revenue and gross margin dollars.\"\n\nTim Cook added: Our installed base is growing at double digits, that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and customer loyalty, etc. This is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to cashier, she says, how many units do you have in there.

We are in early days, and it will keep on getting better and better, but happy with where things are at the moment.\n\n5:49: We want to double services from 2016 by 2020, and Apple is still on pace to achieve that, Maestri said.\n\n5:48: We have a very large and growing install base, Luca Maestri says, all product categories is at all-time high. We've added new services to our portfolio, we've added advertising business on App Store, and would want to continue to offer new services over time.\n\n5:46: \"Our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level, and gross margin in the other categories, our guidance isn't changing, it's our report that's changing,\" Cook said.\n\n5:43: Here's the full reasoning why Apple is not providing hardware unit sales going forward:\n\n5:41: Maestri gave an answer about headwinds, providing no insight into why guidance for the next quarter is soft.\n\n5:39: Apple on health. \"Non-monetized services so far, don't want to talk about the future, but this an area of major interest to us.\"\n\n5:38: Tim Cook: Subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is. And that's the value proposition, the vast majority of people are very happy with it, including the most important people, which are the user.\n\n5:36: Tim Cook:\"Slowdown or moratorium on new game approvals...new regulatory setup in China, things are not moving the way they were moving previously, we did see a few games approved recently, but it's very far below the historic case.\"\n\n5:31: Questions have started. BAML asking about deceleration in App Store in emerging markets. Certain markets \"are not growing the way we'd like to see,\" Cook said.\n\n5:29: Other products, which includes products like HomePod and Apple Watch, will be renamed to \"Wearables, Home, and Accessories.\"\n\n5:29: No more unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac starting next quarter. This takes away one of the biggest signals investors look for. Maestri said that sales don't properly reflect the breadth of Apple's value proposition.\n\n5:27: Apple will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for total products and total services starting next quarter, Maestri says.\n\n5:25: Apple's net cash position is $122.6 billion, once you subtract debt from its cash pile, Maestri says.

Take a look at what the capital could look like when it's finished.", "In the 2015-16 season, Stephen Curry rose to new heights with one of the greatest individual seasons in NBA history, for a Golden State Warriors team that had the best regular season in NBA history in going 73-9.\n\nCurry averaged 30 points per game on 52% shooting, 44% from three, with 5 rebounds and nearly 7 assists per game, taking home his second straight MVP award and the first-ever unanimous MVP.\n\nCurry stamped in a new era of basketball, changing the way both offenses and defenses around the league behaved with his unrivaled marksmanship.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, in the first nine games of the 2018-19 season, Curry is on pace to shatter that campaign.\n\nCurry is averaging 33 points, 5 rebounds, and 6 assists per game while shooting a hair under 55% from the field and 53% from three. Those numbers exceed his start to the 2015-16 season when he came blazing out of the gates and made the NBA world gasp a collective, \"Whoa.\"\n\nCurry's star has dulled (if only slightly) the last two seasons, as he gave up the ball more to Kevin Durant while the Warriors adjusted to their newest star. Last year, Curry showed hints of his 2015-16 self, but also had one of his more injury-riddled seasons, playing just 51 games of a possible 82.\n\nNow Curry seems to be sending a message.\n\nPerhaps the NBA world should have taken notice this year when the Warriors spoke candidly about how Curry and Durant were both left out of preseason MVP talk. Head coach Steve Kerr said Curry was aware of such chatter, while Durant said the award seems to be for up-and-comers, rather than the league's most consistent and established dominant forces. Curry is proving he's still the player from the 2015-16 season.\n\nThis season, Curry seems to have a better grasp on where he stands with the 8-1 Warriors. Three years ago, he was the central focus of the offense, the clear No. 1 option, even on a team that prioritized getting everyone involved. The past two years were a feeling-out process where it was rare to see Curry and Durant dominate at the same time while the team played in its trademark, unselfish way.\n\nThis year, there are both tangible and intangible ways to tell Curry is more in control. His shot attempts are up, which is notable for a player sharing the ball with a player like Durant. Curry's efficiency is also through the roof, suggesting he's found ways to benefit from the weapons that surround him \u2014 i.e., he's picking his spots better and thinking less than he might have the last two years.\n\nHis efficient field goal percentage (which accounts for three-pointers vs. two-pointers) is a ridiculous 70.1%, a number typically reserved for big men who only hover near the basket.\n\nThe intangible qualities are harder to pinpoint. Curry's game has an overall mastery to it that seems slightly different than in years past.\n\nCurry rose to prominence because of an outrageous shot selection that made the entire sport of basketball reconsider what should happen in an offensive possession. Curry's list of greatest hits is long, but some of these attempts are audacious, even by his standards.\n\nPreseason predictions that left Curry and Durant out of the conversation were not slights; it's just hard to imagine voters choosing one of the two players when they have each other. In some ways, they almost cancel each other out.\n\nWhat makes Curry's start to the season even more impressive is that it has hardly been a one-person show. After Curry dropped 51 points on the Washington Wizards, Kevin Durant took over the next game, scoring 41 points, with 25 in the fourth quarter. Two games later, Klay Thompson scored 52 points and hit a record-breaking (Curry's record, mind you) 14 three-pointers in three quarters.\n\nRead more: Two plays from Klay Thompson's explosion showed off a unique skill he shares with Stephen Curry that helps make the Warriors impossible to guard\n\nOn Wednesday, the Warriors took down the New Orleans Pelicans, with Curry scoring 37 points on a tidy 12-of-20 shooting, 7-of-11 from downtown. People hardly batted an eye, and such has been the Warriors' theatrics of late.\n\nAs ESPN's Brian Windhorst noted, the list of players in NBA history to win two MVPs and three championships is slim and Curry is on it. The list of players to win three MVPs and four championships is even smaller, and Curry has a good shot at it this year if his pace continues.\n\nSteve Nash told Windhorst that talks about Curry's place among the league's all-time best players should already be underway.\n\n\"I hate to break it to you, but he's already an all-time great,\" Nash said. \"He's the ultimate one-off. He's the evolution of basketball. It evolved before our eyes.\"\n\nThis season, Curry has somehow seemed to raise his ceiling, and if it continues, he'll somehow raise the ceiling on a team that has been dominating the league for years. If Curry and the Warriors keep this up, talk about possible challengers to the reigning champions may as well be shelved.", "Hershey on Thursday released the first photo of its upcoming Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that's 40% thinner than the traditional version \u2014 and its first defense of the lower-calorie treat.\n\nThe sweets company revealed what Reese's Thins would look like compared with other Reese's Cups. The ad is already defending the Thins from criticism, with the tagline \"No wrong way ... just more ways. #NotSorry.\"\n\nHershey announced on a call with investors last week that it planned to launch a new product called Reese's Thins in March.\n\n\"This product is about 40% thinner than the original cup, and it appeals to those consumers who want something sweet with more permissibility,\" Michele Buck, Hershey North America's president, said on the call.\n\nHershey said it would not stop selling the original Reese's Cups.

Taliban control and influence sits at 12.5 percent, and roughly a third of Afghanistan is contested.\n\nTerritorial losses come as the Afghan security forces suffer heavy casualties in the fight against terrorist and militant forces.\n\nSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis revealed just how serious Afghan security force casualties have been in recent months during a discussion at the United States Institute of Peace Tuesday.\n\n\"The Afghan lads are doing the fighting, just look at the casualties,\" he explained. \"Over 1,000 dead and wounded in August and September.\"\n\nSIGAR reports that Afghan National Defense and Security Forces casualties between May and October were the highest they have ever been over the same period in previous years. During a Taliban assault on Ghazni in August, the insurgents killed at least 100 Afghan security forces.\n\nAfghan security forces totaled 312,328 in July, the lowest figure since at least 2012, the report revealed, noting that the total strength of the security forces is down 8,827 from last year.

He had completed 175 races in a six-year span, becoming an IRONMAN All World Athlete in two consecutive years and gracing the cover of Runner's World magazine for their body issue along the way.\n\nBut all of that changed in June of 2014.\n\nHartrick had just competed at the Memorial Hermann IRONMAN North American Championship in The Woodlands, Texas and was out on a routine training bike ride when a car made an illegal U-turn and hit him.\n\nHe was instantly paralyzed from the chest down.\n\nHartrick spent 30 days in the hospital and two months at the Kessler Rehab Institute healing nine broken ribs, two collapsed lungs, a broken jaw, broken scapula, and blood clots in both of his legs.\n\n\"I had the mentality of the overused cliche 'life is a marathon, not a sprint,' and I really took that to heart,\" Hartrick said. \"It seemed like an insurmountable mountain to climb at the moment and then all of a sudden I'm making progress [in my recovery], and that gave me motivation, just like it did when I ran my first marathons. I really tried to use that mentality that I had as an athlete to get me better both mentally and physically.\"\n\nBut even before Hartrick completed his inpatient rehabilitation and returned home, he was focused on finding his way back across finish lines.\n\n\"I said 'I'm sitting in the hospital right now but I'm going to come back and I'm going to do the 2015 New York City Marathon right where my journey started,'\" Hartrick said. \"I knew that was going to be my recovery and help me prove to myself that I'm back and I'm still me.\"\n\nThere was a handcycle in the outpatient unit at the hospital, and as soon as he had the necessary strength, Hartrick was doing laps down in the parking lot. Soon enough, he was ready to return home and resume training on his own.\n\n\"I got my handcycle in March of 2015 from the Challenged Athletes Foundation,\" Hartrick said. \"It was really difficult, but once I got focused that same fire came back and came back instantly. It was amazing.\" Wayne Stephens\n\nSixteen months after the accident, Hartrick finished the TCS New York City Marathon in 1:37, good for 10th overall in the handcycle category. He went on to finish third overall in the handcycle category at both the Philadelphia and Los Angeles Marathons later that year.\n\nThe following year, he was the fifth overall and first American finisher in the handcycle category at the New York City Marathon. In 2017, he finished first at both the Philadelphia and New Jersey Marathons before making his IRONMAN return. He finished first in the physically challenged open division at the 2017 IRONMAN Florida with a time of 13:11:07.\n\n\"When I did my first IRONMAN, I did it in 13 hours and 48 minutes,\" Hartrick said. \"When I came back and did it again as a physically challenged athlete for the first time, I was faster than when I first did it as an able-bodied athlete.\"\n\nHartrick dreamed of attending the IRONMAN World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii since he first became a competitive triathlete. He came close in 2012, finishing less than two minutes too late at the IRONMAN U.S. Championship in New York City, but he never managed to qualify before his accident. Hartrick was selected to attend the IRONMAN World Championship this year and was the sixth overall and third American in his division to cross the finish line.\n\n\"There are a lot of things in life that don't meet expectations because they're hyped up so much, but I can tell you this met every single expectation that I ever had,\" Hartrick said. \"It was harder, it was faster, and it was hotter, but it was more rewarding than I ever could have imagined.\"\n\nNow, Hartrick is quickly shifting gears to the 2018 TCS New York City Marathon November 4, where he will race in the pushchair category for the first time.\n\n\"There is not a better day in New York than marathon Sunday,\" Hartrick said. \"It's the best marathon in the world for a reason. It was my first marathon back in 2006, and it was my first comeback race back in 2015. Now to be able to do it in a racing chair knowing how far I've come, I really think I'm helping to prove that anything is possible.\"\n\n\"The first goal is to beat the time I did it in as a runner the first time,\" Hartrick said. \"I know that there's some potential significant upside after that, so anything else would just be the icing on the cake.\" Wayne Stephens\n\nNot only will the race be a personal milestone for Hartrick, but he will also find his way into the history books when he crosses the iconic finish line. He will become the first person to ever finish the race in the open, handcycle, and push rim divisions.\n\n\"It's an exclusive club that I belong to, and I don't encourage it for everybody else. If they can just stick to running I think they'll be better off,\" Hartrick joked. \"But it gives me some credibility when I'm speaking to kid with paralysis, or I go back to Mt. Sinai or Kessler and can speak to some newly-injured individuals or kids. I can say 'four years ago, I was you. I was sitting in a hospital bed, and this was what I was faced with. Of course, your life is turned upside-down, but it gets better, and it gets easier, and look, this is what you can do.'\n\n\"To me, that's the most important piece of being able to cross the finish line in all three categories.\"", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

In the days that followed, some US conservatives attempted to label him an extremist due to an interview he conducted with late Al Qaeda head Osama bin Laden early in his career as well as his expressed sympathies for political Islam.\n\nBut those who knew Khashoggi, including his family and former colleagues, have completely rejected the notion he had ties to extremism.\n\nIn a statement, his family said, \"Jamal Khashoggi was not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.

His campaign continued to seize on anti-immigrant sentiments, as he riled supporters up with a promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and the assertion that Mexico would pay for it.\n\nSince entering the White House, Trump has only escalated this trend.\n\nIn August, for example, Trump used the killing of Mollie Tibbetts, a 20-year-old University of Iowa student, to renew calls for funding for his border wall. The suspect in the killing is a Mexican national who was reportedly living in the US illegally.\n\nResponding to the news of Tibbetts' death, Trump said, \"A person came in from Mexico, illegally, and killed her. We need the wall, we need our immigration laws changed, we need our border laws changed.\"\n\nMore recently, ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Trump released an ad falsely linking Democrats to an undocumented immigrant who killed two police officers in California.\n\nBeyond the fact that experts say a border wall would do little to stop undocumented immigration, Trump's rhetoric on this issue has completely ignored statistics that show native-born Americans commit crimes at a higher rate than undocumented immigrants.\n\nRead more: Trump invited 'permanently separated' families to speak about loved ones allegedly killed by unauthorized immigrants \u2014 and he autographed posters of the victims' faces\n\nAs David Mosher of Business Insider reported in August:\n\nMultiple studies using federal and state data have found no suggestion that rising immigration rates leads to more violent crime.\n\nThe charts below come from a December 2016 study published in the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice. They show that US saw a 118% increase in its immigrant population (documented and undocumented) from 1980 through 2016.\n\nYet during this same period, the rate of violent crime \u2014 homicides, rapes, robberies, and assaults, according to the FBI \u2014 fell by 36% to about 386 incidents per 100,000 residents.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nA more recent peer-reviewed study, published in March 2017 by The Sociological Quarterly, compared all forms of immigration and violence in rural versus urban communities from 1990 through 2010. The number of foreign-born residents \u2014 accounting for many other factors \u2014 appeared to reduce violent crime rates in rural areas, though not at statistically significant levels. But in cities, immigration was significantly associated with reduced rates of violent crimes.\n\nThere's also a study published in February by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, which further rejects the idea that illegal immigration is tied to increases in rates of violent crime.\n\nThe study looked at conviction data in Texas \u2014 the state with the second-largest population of foreign-born residents \u2014 for native-born, unauthorized immigrant, and legal immigrant residents.\n\nThe research found that native-born residents were most likely to commit and be convicted of crimes, while unauthorized immigrants saw a conviction rate that was about 50% lower. Legal immigrants appeared to be the most law-abiding, with 86% fewer convictions than native-born Texans.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nThere's also a Criminology journal study from March that examined states' reported rates of violent crime and illegal immigration. From 1990 through 2014, that data found a negative correlation \u2014 meaning that the more a population was made up of unauthorized immigrants, the lower the violent crime rate seemed to be.\n\nIn short, there's a broad set of data showing Trump's cherry-picked examples of violent undocumented immigrants don't paint an accurate picture of crime in the US, or of undocumented immigrants in general.", "In New York, a city where the average apartment rent is $3,600 a month, many residents don't mind living in a tiny space to save extra cash.

NBC shuttered its comedy streaming service Seeso last year, and couldn't get the app Watchable off the ground.\n\nWhat about Now TV?\n\nThe timing of Comcast's aversion to streaming is interesting. A highlight of the third quarter earnings call was a separate presentation on Sky, which Comcast recently acquired. Sky already has an OTT service called Now TV, and with 23 million satellite subscribers in Europe, Comcast now has a large customer base to convert over to OTT subscribers.\n\nThat option is so attractive that some analysts predicted Comcast might focus on a global Netflix challenger, building out Now TV, which already has a strong content portfolio with exclusive rights to run HBO shows like \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Westworld\" across Europe, as well as the majority of Premier League TV rights and exclusive rights to the German Bundesliga. Comcast also has a 30% stake in Hulu, with majority ownership from Disney, which would directly compete with Comcast's newly-acquired Now TV, Sky's OTT platform. That has led some analysts to predict Comcast will sell its Hulu stake.\n\n\"Comcast may divest its stake in Hulu given it will now have its own Now TV platform and would likely have no interest in feeding its content to a direct competitor to both sides of its business,\" according to a research note by Cowen analysts.\n\nIn the US, Comcast's recent attention has been on the OTT integrations on its X1 set-top box.\n\nX1 is the number one platform for Netflix in its footprint, according to Strauss, and Comcast has integrated YouTube service into its platform, with Amazon Prime Video coming soon. Comcast's goal is to offer to customers a seamless way to access all of its content in one place.\n\n\"We really see X1 as the premium destination for allowing customers to get access to all of their TV choices in one place,\" Strauss said. \"Some say the future of TV is apps, we really believe it is more and more around aggregation.\"", "Apple's new iPad Pros were revealed this Tuesday, but analysts are already speculating about what next year's models could have.\n\nAccording to Ming-Chi Kuo, a well-respected analyst for TF International Securities, next year's iPad Pro could have an advanced 3D camera using a technology called \"time of flight.\" Kuo is well-known for accurately predicting future Apple products.\n\nA high-quality 3D camera is needed for augmented reality applications, a kind of technology that displays computer graphics in the real world.

Just a few weeks earlier, Krappe was onstage at the company's annual user conference delivering one of his trademark \"free-form\" speeches. These often began with an abstract history lesson (topics included human evolution and Turkish archaeology) and eventually segued into Quote-to-Cash, a sales software, Apttus' signature product.\n\nIt didn't take long before rumors about Krappe's disappearance were swirling through the company's offices. There had been a booze-filled sales retreat in Cabo. There were allegations of sexual assault. Had Krappe been forced out, people wondered?\n\nThe story about Cabo was just one of many worrisome allegations involving Krappe that were coming to a head around the time, and which ultimately would suggest that the tech entrepreneur's old-world charm and erudite air might be concealing a pattern of questionable behavior.\n\nWith promises of an eventual IPO, Krappe sold employees, customers, and investors on a Silicon Valley dream that in hindsight appeared to have been only loosely based in reality.\n\nInstead of a hot IPO-bound startup, the company Krappe created was by a number of accounts a lawless place where sexual harassment and inappropriate relationships were rampant at the highest levels, according to several former employees and insiders Business Insider spoke with and according to legal documents.\n\nMisdeeds such as padding expense reports and promising clients nonexistent products were encouraged, the people said, and any voices of dissent were swiftly silenced.\n\nAt a time when reports of inappropriate behavior among executives at high-profile tech companies from Google to Uber have come to light, the story of Apttus is more than just another disturbing example of alleged sexual misconduct in the male-dominated technology business.\n\nThe startup's still unfolding drama, if the allegations are true, shows how pervasively a company can be infected by toxic behavior once it's taken root at the top of the organization, and how easily it is allowed to happen in Silicon Valley.\n\nBig-name backers from Salesforce Ventures to ICONiQ Capital to IBM's venture arm invested in Apttus during Krappe's tenure, even as his behavior \u2014 including having a child outside of his marriage with a manager at the company \u2014 raised eyebrows throughout the organization.\n\nApttus' last venture round in September 2017 valued the company at $1.86 billion. Salesforce, whose founder, Marc Benioff, is an outspoken advocate for stamping out sexism in the workplace, declined to comment, as did IBM. ICONiQ Capital, which is closely associated with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, both prominent supporters of the #MeToo movement, did not return requests for comment. Zuckerberg and Sandberg declined to comment.\n\nTwo months after Krappe's departure, Apttus sold a majority stake to Thoma Bravo, a Chicago private-equity firm with offices in San Francisco.\n\nMultiple lawsuits\n\nIt's unclear whether Thoma Bravo was aware of the allegations surrounding Krappe during the time of the acquisition. But while the problematic CEO was gone by the time Thoma Bravo announced the deal, some of the problems created during Krappe's reign are likely to live on.\n\nSeveral claims involving allegations of harassment or a hostile work environment are in various stages of negotiations, Business Insider has learned, and there are three lawsuits from former employees who claim that Krappe had misled them about the health and size of Apttus' business.\n\nAnd in a recent letter sent to David Murphy, the Apttus executive chairman installed by Thoma Bravo, in October, a former Apttus employee hinted at more forthcoming legal claims.\n\nThe private-equity firm has not disclosed how much it paid to acquire its majority stake in Apttus, which has raised about $400 million in funding over the years. In a news release announcing the deal, Thoma Bravo touted the \"operational excellence\" it would bring to Apttus, which makes software to helps businesses manage revenues and customer relationships.\n\nRepresentatives from Apttus declined to comment. Thoma Bravo did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA night of heavy drinking at the hotel bar\n\nThe claim that preceded Krappe's departure was made by a 26-year-old rising star on Apttus' business-development team who, along with her aunt, attended a February retreat in Mexico that Apttus hosted for high-performing sales personnel.\n\nThe Presidents Club event, as Apttus called the company getaway, took place at the One&Only Palmilla resort near Cabo San Lucas, a coastal property that to many is the epitome of paradise. Located 30 minutes from downtown Cabo, the beachfront is lined with palm trees and beach chairs. Its bright-blue infinity pool is an Instagram influencer's dream with its dramatic views of where the Gulf of California meets the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt was there, after a night of heavy drinking at the hotel bar, that Krappe allegedly followed the business-development employee back to her hotel room and sexually assaulted her.\n\nThe claim against Krappe, which was described to Business Insider by multiple people familiar with the events, was settled outside of court in early June. A large sum of money changed hands, and both Krappe and the plaintiff left the company at the time of the settlement. Gloria Allred, who represented the plaintiffs on the case, declined to comment.\n\nKrappe did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nBikinis, massages, and 'sexulence'\n\nFor some employees, signs of dysfunction and unprofessional conduct were routine at Apttus.\n\nIn early 2015, people at the company noticed that one of their colleagues was pregnant. The late-20s blonde, who managed the global partnerships and business-development teams at Apttus, had started showing. Though she was tight-lipped about her relationship with Krappe, most people at the company thought it was his child, sources told Business Insider.\n\nKrappe, who was in his mid-50s at the time, was still legally married to the mother of his four oldest children. But the newly minted couple got engaged and started raising their newborn daughter as a family.\n\nPeople felt scandalized, but it wasn't just because of the affair. Krappe's fianc\u00e9e moved up quickly at Apttus, and eventually managed a team called the Salesforce Excellence Team, known by some internally as the \"sexulence team\" because it was made up exclusively of \"very pretty girls.\"\n\nIt was that team's job to fly around the country to host social events with salespeople at Salesforce, a crucial Apttus partner at the time and an investor in the startup.\n\nThat team, multiple sources said, was liberal with its expenses. Sources told Business Insider that manicures and massages would be documented as team-bonding expenses. Luxurious dinners between two Apttus employees would be documented as four-person client dinners with nonexistent Salesforce employees. In at least one instance, bikinis and beach chairs got expensed on a trip to Florida.\n\n\"We were encouraged to spend money on anything, and it would be approved,\" one former team employee said.\n\nEmployees on other teams took note of the spending, and of the fianc\u00e9e's special status at the company. One employee on the fianc\u00e9e's team went to HR and blew the whistle about the spending. Not long after, that employee was asked to leave the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Krappe's fianc\u00e9e did not return requests for comment.\n\n\"It's like a zoo, and you either bite or you'll get bitten,\" another former employee said. \"I've never worked at a company like this ever. It's strange.\"\n\nA meeting at the fish market\n\nBut the alleged misdeeds at Apttus went a lot deeper than just expense reports.\n\nIn mid-2017, Apttus was hit with two lawsuits from former employees who both alleged that executives at Apttus, including Krappe, lied about the company's sales pipeline, product readiness, and command structure to get them to join the company. A third suit, on behalf of a former general manager and vice president William Veiga, is pending.\n\nThe first two suits were filed on behalf of Elizabeth Baker and Marco De La Cuesta, high flyers in the enterprise-sales world. Baker had previously worked for Oracle and both spent time at SAP. They took managerial roles on the sales team at Apttus in late 2015, and were terminated by the board in June 2016.\n\nBoth complaints allege that they were fired over their refusal \"to engage in the requested illegal and unethical conduct, and otherwise engage in a culture of dishonesty and corruption.\"\n\nIn her complaint, Baker describes meeting Krappe for lunch at the Fish Market in San Mateo before she took the job, and being told by Krappe that Apttus was experiencing \"unprecedented growth in large enterprise companies.\"\n\nIn their respective lawsuits, both Baker and De La Cuesta allege that Krappe sold them on Apttus as a company with a $400 million sales pipeline, but that pipeline didn't exist. He also sold them on key customers, including Intel, Clorox, GE, HPE/HPI, and McKesson, and both allege that parts of the customer base were fictionalized or misrepresented.\n\nIn the case of Intel, the Silicon Valley chip giant, both suits allege that Apttus sought to sell a product that didn't yet exist. Intel grew concerned that something was wrong \"after extensive suspicious delays and excuses from Apttus,\" according to the complaints.\n\nIt all came to a head in a meeting with the team, when Intel asked directly if the products it had \"purchased had actually been developed, and if other Apttus customers were currently using the products today, in an actual production environment,\" according to the complaints.\n\nOne team member deferred to another, who told Intel they had nothing to worry about. Later, the first team member said that he refused to answer their question because \"his wife worked at Intel and 'he did not want to lie,'\" the complaint said.\n\nIntel declined to comment.\n\n'Devalued, bullied, and treated like dirt'\n\nKrappe's credibility among some employees began to suffer as his long-promised IPO never materialized.\n\nFor two years, Krappe had told employees and the public that Apttus would IPO imminently. A $55 million funding round in late September 2017 meant Apttus was flush with cash, but employees were starting to lose hope that they would ever see a big payout on the equity that many were offered as part of their pay packages.\n\nKrappe told TechCrunch that Apttus would IPO in 2016 if it didn't get bought, and, later that year, he told MarketWatch that the company intended to go public in 2017. In October 2017, Bloomberg reported that Apttus hired Goldman Sachs to manage the offering.\n\nWith so much compensation wrapped up in equity, the IPO was highly personal to employees. But when staff members inquired into the delay, one person said, management would claim that the company just wasn't ready, and would invoke the IPO quiet period as a reason they couldn't explain the situation more in depth.\n\n\"We'd go to all-hands meetings where he'd speak and try to be inspirational,\" one former employee said of Krappe. \"He always talked about being a team and being on a rocket. When you hear something repetitively, you're, like, 'This is something I've heard over and over.'\"\n\nThe poor employee morale has outlived Krappe within Apttus.\n\nIn a recent letter to David Murphy, the Apttus executive chairman installed by Thoma Bravo, a former Apttus employee describes a place overrun by fear, bullying, and discrimination, and hints at more forthcoming legal claims. The author of the letter, Kyle Bouchard, was employee 33 at the startup and had moved up to vice president of strategic accounts. He resigned from the company soon after its acquisition in September.\n\n\"As a human being, you only can take so much of this brutality and for me, I chose not to be a part of a company where employees are devalued, bullied, and treated like dirt,\" Bouchard wrote in the letter obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe letter singled out Krappe's handpicked chief strategy officer, Raj Verma, who is now COO, for many of the ongoing problems. According to insiders, Verma and Krappe worked closely together until the spring, when things came to a head. Bouchard declined to comment.\n\nVerma did not return a request for comment.\n\n'Never give up'\n\nWhether Krappe will attempt to return to the business world is unclear. Business Insider is not aware of any criminal charges filed against him as a result of the alleged assault.\n\nOn the February night of the Presidents Club award ceremony in Cabo, just hours after the alleged sexual assault, Krappe and the rest of Apttus team headed to a farmhouse restaurant called Flora Farms, known for frequent celebrity guests such as Jennifer Aniston.\n\nDuring the dinner, Krappe took the stage to pass out trophies to his star employees, according to people who were present. In the background, a video projected on the wall played Krappe's biography, tracing his life from his roots in Africa to the founding of Apttus. The video ends with Krappe's youngest daughter, now a toddler, running up and jumping into his arms during a staff photo in San Mateo.\n\nIn Swahili, and then English, words flash across the screen: \"Never give up.\"\n\nAs the video played, the audience could see Krappe well up with tears.\n\nGot a tip about Apttus?

In battle rap, nothing is off limits. You can talk about the person's race, looks, medical condition, sexual preference, their dead mom. Nothing is taboo.\n\n\"Bodied\" (opening in theaters Friday and available on YouTube November 28) is basically \"8 Mile\" if it wasn't made in Hollywood. We follow Adam (Calum Worthy), a white graduate student who is fascinated by the art of battle rapping and befriends one of Oakland's best, Behn Grymm (Jackie Long), to be his guide in the battle rap culture so he can write a thesis paper on it. But it turns out Adam has some skills, and he quickly finds himself on the circuit with Behn battle rapping. Eventually Adam gets so engrossed in the rush of the culture that he's willing to alienate his family, friends, and even Behn to rise in the battle rap ranks.\n\nThe movie, which Eminem is a producer on, isn't just a satirical exploration of woke culture and the echo chamber that is social media. Kahn uses his talents to tell two stories: one vocally through the storytelling of the raps (penned masterfully by real battle rapper Kid Twist) and the other visually, as Kahn scatters the movie with special effects to heighten the prose.\n\nBusiness Insider sat down with Kahn in New York City to talk about why the only way he could make the movie was to self-finance it, how he passed on a major Hollywood blockbuster to make \"Bodied,\" how he put the actors through battle rap boot camp, and why the movie makes you feel less racist because it's so racist.\n\nJason Guerrasio: Would this have been made without you self-financing it?\n\nJoseph Kahn: Absolutely not. Can you imagine taking this script with two hours of racist, misogynist, homophobic jokes?\n\nGuerrasio: It would be watered down to the point of being unwatchable.\n\n\"Bodied\" director Joseph Kahn. Getty Kahn: Right. And here's the thing, battle rap does exist in the popular culture in things like roasts and \"Drop the Mic\" and all that stuff, but that's not really battle rap. That's saying someone who gets into a pity-pat slap fight is boxing. No, in boxing you're supposed to get hurt. The entire agenda is that your opponent is knocked out. In battle rap, you're supposed to hurt the opponent to the point they are dead.\n\nGuerrasio: In the early days, did you ever think that someone out there might get what you wanted to do and write you a check instead of you using your own money?\n\nKahn: The story behind this is I made this short \"Power/Rangers,\" which is this thing I put online that I made in secret for a year. I wanted to make a commentary on grim, dark superheroes and how Hollywood markets the stuff. Doing a satire by making the most serious version of the silliest kids property. After that came out, literally every studio knocked at my door. And I looked at every project floating around and I couldn't find one property I was interested in doing.\n\nGuerrasio: You were even being offered the major IPs?\n\nKahn: They were there, and I had the opportunity and nothing interested me. So I was talking to Adi Shankar, my producing partner on \"Power/Rangers\" and he said, \"What do you want to do next?\" And I said, \"Well, I have choice one, which is this big property, or choice two is I want to make a battle rap movie.\" And he said, \"Do choice two.\"\n\n\"Bodied.\" Neon Guerrasio: So what kind of check did you have to write yourself for this?\n\nKahn: I did it for under $2 million.\n\nGuerrasio: It looks amazing for what you put in.\n\nKahn: That includes soundtrack, by the way. And we shot it over 23 days with a SAG crew. If anyone knows anything about film business, that's extraordinarily hard what we did. Which shows me that if I ever wanted to do one of these big Hollywood movies, I'll know how to do it.Guerrasio: But the thing is you won't be able to do it your way. You'll have to collaborate with the executives.\n\nKahn: And by the way, I'm not opposed to that. I just need to make sure I'm in a position where I believe in the project. I mean, I do Lexus commercials, I think I can work with others.\n\nGuerrasio: Here's the irony of what you did with \"Bodied.\" You self-finance the movie, do it how you want to, but now you have to sell it to a distributor or streaming service so audiences can see it. You have to play the game. Before going into that process, did you consider self-distribution?\n\nKahn: It was a serious thought at one point. And I'll tell you exactly when it was, it was when I was submitting to film festivals and getting turned down by every one of them. Sundance, SXSW, Tribeca, New York Film Festival.\n\nGuerrasio: Then Sundance showed it this year.\n\nKahn: Yeah, the year after I submitted it. What happened was everyone was very uncomfortable with the film because it didn't fall into a very specific category. I do feel that the movies that are on the indie film circuit, and I'm a liberal person, these are just movies that have liberals clapping themselves on the back. Like showing, \"I'm so woke.\" This movie says murder is bad. Well, of course murder is bad. This movie had this amazing message that slavery is bad. Yes, it's bad. What exactly are you saying that you don't already know? I find these weak, quite frankly. Something like \"Bodied\" is a morality tale, but a satiric morality tale. With satire you don't have to state your moral. You can criticize a moral without having an answer, and that's what we did. We are criticizing today's world. I don't think filmmakers should be giving answers, because who are these guys and girls? Just because they were able to finance a movie they suddenly are philosopher kings that have all the answers to life? This is a ridiculous thing.\n\nRead more: Oliver Stone says comparing 'disaster' of Bush's presidency to Trump is ridiculous and 'trivializes the situation,' as he reflects on his biopic 'W.' 10 years later\n\nGuerrasio: What made you not go the self-distribution route?\n\nKahn: The last major film festival we did, Toronto. We were in the Midnight section and from what I understand we were right on the fence. Specifically the young people, the millennials, were like, \"This is so racist you can't program this,\" and they voted against the movie being in the festival. The young people voted against this movie! Which is crazy! But it played at Toronto and won the Midnight audience award. Then it played at AFI and it won the audience award, and at Fantastic Fest it won the audience award. It turns out people are not offended by this movie, people are enjoying themselves. This whole concept that woke culture has of the completely not-racist person that sees no stereotypes that lives a perfectly amazing life, this person does not exist. The reality is differences in people are funny. It's a movie that makes you feel less racist by being more racist.\n\nGuerrasio: You should put that on the poster.\n\nKahn: [laughs] And the movie changes depending on what the national politics are at that point. Look what's happened this week, bombs being sent out to the left, a synagogue being shot up, and then we have Megyn Kelly being fired over blackface comments. This is the context of how this movie is being released this week.\n\nGuerrasio: Who knows what will happen two weeks from now.\n\nKahn: It might be some completely different context.\n\nAdam (Calum Worthy) reaching for racist lyrics during a battle rap. One of the many visual effects used in \"Bodied\" that director Joseph Kahn calls \"inter-subjective camera work.\" Neon/YouTube Guerrasio: What's great about this movie is the camera work. The cutaways you do to show reaction shots of battle rap lyrics is as funny as the lyrics themselves. The creative over-the-shoulder shots. The visual effects that pop up in the middle of raps. Were all of these things in your head for a while and \"Bodied\" was the vessel to use them?\n\nKahn: In my off time I often think on a quantum mechanical level of how films work. I'm not talking about just story or act structure, I'm talking about how to edit work. I have really been getting into subjective filmmaking, how to isolate the camera to go into someone's perspective for subjectivity. So the visual effects are intersubjective camera work where you're blending in watching the person and experiencing what that person is saying, all at once.\n\nGuerrasio: Outside of the visuals, there are the performances. How did you get these actors to give a naturalistic feel of being battle rappers?\n\nKahn: There was a huge rehearsal beforehand. They went to battle rap school. There's this battle rapper Rone who taught Adam to be more racist, to put it frankly. Like the line about cutting the bonsai tree, he told him, \"But say it with an Asian accent.\" [laughs] So there was a two-month battle rap school they went to and that was still happening on set. It was so critical that they get all the lines exactly right. It was, no joke, like Shakespeare. Most films you can screw up the lines, with this, for the structure to work, you must hit exactly the word at the point you're supposed to hit it.\n\nGuerrasio: What did Eminem think of the \"8 Mile\" insults in the movie?\n\nKahn: He loved it. He watched it and was into it. His whole camp was like, \"This is stuff we hear every day, so we love this.\" This is the thing about Eminem, he's incredibly self-deprecating. He knows who he is, he knows how he plays in the culture. The reason why he's successful as opposed to other white rappers is that he gets it. He's always referencing himself as a fraud or fake Elvis, and I think the self-deprecation serves him well.\n\nGuerrasio: I'm curious, do music video directors root for one another when you guys go out and make a feature? Like, did you drop Director X a line and wish him luck on the release of \"Superfly\"?\n\nKahn: I am the worst person to ask about this because I am the most antisocial person. It's surprising that I have a healthy career in music videos because I am the last person that should be hanging out with any celebrity. On my daily basis, when I'm not shooting, I'm literally just surfing the internet or reading a book. That's all I do.\n\nGuerrasio: So it's not like the music video director community hang out a lot.\n\nKahn: I really don't know any other filmmakers. I just don't hang out.\n\nGuerrasio: Is this breaking news to you that a music video director made \"Superfly.\"\n\nKahn: I actually didn't even know there was a movie called \"Superfly.\"\n\nGuerrasio: [laughs] You should see it.\n\nKahn: And here is the other thing, it's very hard to get me in a movie theater. For me it's not a financial issue, though for most it is. I think that's why most go see a Marvel movie because it's a safe bet. It's a low risk.\n\nGuerrasio: You're not doing a good job selling \"Bodied\" right now.\n\nKahn: [laughs] I would like people to picture \"Bodied\" as Amazon back in 1998. We are a $5 stock. We seem risky as hell, but I feel if you invest in us, we'll rock your world.", "The final roster for the launch of \"Super Smash Bros.

JUUL responded that it planned to work with the FDA, and that its \"mission is to improve the lives of adult smokers by providing them with a true alternative to combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nBut evidence has been mounting that Juul's products have significant appeal to young people.\n\nThe latest comes in a Morgan Stanley research report published Thursday. It found that about 15% of Juul users weren't smokers before they started vaping, and that group tended to be younger than other vapers.\n\nOn Tuesday, a different survey found that a higher portion of young people aged 15-17 are using the Juul at least once a month compared to those aged 25-34.\n\nMorgan Stanley surveyed 402 Juul users above age 18, so the bank's survey doesn't provide information about users younger than that. Among the youngest group in the survey, those 18-24, a third hadn't smoked before starting to use Juul.\n\nThere were some positive findings for Juul in the survey, according to the research report. Juul helped almost half of its users who also smoke cigarettes cut down on their cigarette consumption. About 16 percent stopped smoking entirely.\n\nSome moved in the other direction. Of the nonsmokers, 20% became smokers after using Juul.

Twitter/Alvin Lie/Business Insider\n\nA viral post claims that Lion Air had been ranked with the lowest possible safety record, but is an untrue forgery which emerged in the wake of a fatal crash this week.\n\nLion Air flight JT 610 crashed into the sea on Monday and killed everyone on board. It has a history of occasional safety issues, but was widely considered safe to use before Monday's crash.\n\nHowever, a faked screenshot purporting to be from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) website says otherwise.\n\nIt listed Lion Air among a number of other Indonesian airlines, claiming that they all have a one-star rating and the \"lowest safety performance\". The post has been spreading on social media, particularly in Indonesia itself.\n\nBut the IATA told Business Insider that the ranking was not from them, and that it does not even publish airline safety ratings.\n\nAn IATA spokesperson told Business Insider: \"We would like to clarify that it is not an IATA document.\"\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, t he IATA said that \"does not consider airline safety ratings or rankings to be a valid measure of an individual organization's safety performance.\"\n\nIt also says that there \"no objective criteria or metrics exist by which it is possible to do this\" and questioned the validity of rankings produced elsewhere.\n\nRead more: What we know about the victims of the Lion Air plane crash off Indonesia, where there were 'likely no survivors'\n\nIt says that \"airline safety rankings are inherently flawed\" and instead it considers the overall safety of the commercial airline industry.\n\nTwitter user Alvin Lie drew attention to the hoax, sharing an image of the screenshot which lists the airlines as \"non recommended.\" The tweet, which is in Indonesian, urged people to not spread hoaxes.\n\nIt also included a statement from the IATA's office in Indonesia that says the organization \"has never made this kind of statements [sic] especially for public consumption.\"\n\nLion Air performs well in other airline safety rankings. It gets six out of seven stars by AirlineRatings.com, which considers things like its fatality record and whether the airline is endorsed by the US Federal Aviation Authority.\n\nIt is not clear whether this rating has been updated since Monday's crash.\n\nBut the safety record of Lion Air and of Indonesian airlines generally has come under increased scrutiny since the flight plunged into the Java sea en route from Jakarta to Bangka Island in what was the worst airliner accident of 2018.\n\nFamilies of passengers on the crashed Lion Air flight look at the belongings of passengers in Jakarta's Tanjung Priok port.

Alabama is different than Nebraska,\" Kudlow said. \"That's why the federal minimum wage doesn't work for me.\"\n\nThe federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour (which comes out to roughly $15,000 a year), where it has been since 2009, but the buying power of that wage has eroded over the past nine years. While 29 states have increased their minimum wage above the federal minimum, Democrats and labor groups have argued that the current minimum wage does not provide a living wage and should be increased to $15 an hour.\n\nKudlow said at the event that he would oppose any deal to raise the federal minimum wage and said the best way to boost average worker pay was to cut corporate taxes.\n\nThe GOP did include a large corporate tax cut in the massive tax reform law passed in 2017. But while wage growth is continuing on the post-financial crisis upward trend, there has been little evidence that wages have suddenly jumped above that long-run growth trend due to the cut.\n\nKudlow also addressed a series of other topics ranging from the trade war to Social Security cuts.

Posters for the film released in September showed people contorted into disturbing positions, including actress Uma Thurman, who also stars as one of Jack's many victims.\n\nSome critics called the movie \"unpleasant\" and \"torturous,\" while others actually liked it.

By Halloween, it had more than 11,000 signatures in support of the tower getting a \"Lord of the Rings\" makeover.\n\nWith 11,000 LED lights making up the screen atop the tower, the glowing eye could be seen clearly against the dark sky in San Francisco on Wednesday.\n\nBut the stunt originally didn't seem likely to happen, as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff quickly shot down the idea early in October.\n\nRead more: Over 1,300 people are asking CEO Marc Benioff to turn Salesforce Tower into the 'Eye of Sauron' on Halloween night \u2014 but he's not into it\n\nThough the 1,070-foot-tall tower serves as the software company's headquarters, the building and the display on top are owned by Boston Properties.

It's a mission called RemoveDEBRIS, and if all goes according to plan, it could save the future of space travel as we know it.\n\nThe objective of RemoveDEBRIS is just that. Demonstrate how we could remove space debris that's cluttering up Earth's orbit, including pieces of used up rockets and retired satellites. Even though you can't see it from the ground, there are more than half a million chunks of space trash flying around our planet, and most of it is concentrated in low earth orbit, where it whips around at 28,000 kilometers an hour. Fast enough to fly from LA to London, in just 19 minutes, but here's the trouble with that. Low earth orbit is our front door to the universe. To get anywhere in space, whether it's the International Space Station, Mars, or beyond, we have to cross that threshold first, but if you have a bunch of garbage blocking your path, it's gonna be difficult. Even worse, experts, like astrophysicist Donald Kessler, fear that just one collision between two large objects, could seal up that opening forever, because it would set off a chain reaction. One collision after another, after another, which could produce thousands of additional pieces of debris. This domino effect is called the \"Kessler Syndrome,\" after Donald Kessler himself, and it predicts that low earth orbit could become littered with space trash, making it too dangerous for spacecraft to fly through, or also reduce their life spans because of collisions.\n\nThat's where Europe's RemoveDEBRIS mission comes in. In 2018, it successfully tested the first of four stages of its trash clean up technology, and it looked like this. This is not an illustration. This is actually happening in space. That's a net about the size of a large dining room tablecloth, ensnaring a small spacecraft that the mission team planted for the experiment. Now, this was just the first of what will, hopefully, be many more tests, because in the future, we're gonna need a bigger net.\n\nGuglielmo S. Aglietti: At the end of the day, the final goal is to be able to capture very large targets, so, possibly what one of the targets that has been mentioned, as a potential one, is an old satellite, Envisat, and it is maybe the size of a bus.\n\nNarrator: Scientists have been proposing ways to clean up space junk since the early 90s. They've thought of everything, from lasers, to robotic claws. But this is the first time any concept has actually been tested in space. The team hopes to test its other three technologies, as well, which involve a harpoon, for spearing the trash, a navigation system for analyzing the trash's size, distance, and rotation, and a sail for slowing the trash down, so it can reenter, and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. But all this technology isn't the reason this mission has come closer than any before it.\n\nAglietti: Everybody agrees, that to remove some of this debris, is the right thing to do, but, clearly, the issue is going to be, you know, the cost.\n\nNarrator: The RemoveDEBRIS project has cost 15 million euro, or, about 17 million US dollars.\n\nAglietti: The current mission was sponsored by the European community, and, again, we had, you know, ten partners, working on this project, and, overall, the cost of this project was about, you know, \u20ac15 [million]. When you are going to do this kind of mission, for real, the cost will be higher, and, so, I think the various stakeholders around the world, have to get together, and decide how such mission could be funded. We are talking about not just, you know, the UK, or, maybe, NASA, but also, China, you know, Russia, and so on. The problem is, again, who is going to pay for it?\n\nNarrator: So, Europe has taken the lead.

And the overwhelming concern within the sector appears to be rising protectionism.\n\n\"For the consumer, the tariffs are for the most part still an abstract idea, but for manufacturers they are real, and a big problem,\" said Ian Sheperdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said Thursday that its index of national factory activity dropped 2.1 percentage points to 57.7 in October from a month earlier. The decline was largely thanks to uncertainty related to tariffs, according to survey respondents.\n\n\"Mounting pressure due to pending tariffs,\" observed one respondent in the ISM survey. \"Bracing for delays in material from China \u2014 a rush of orders trying to race tariff implementation is flooding shipping and customs.\"\n\n\"Higher costs related to trade tariffs are starting to be passed on to the cost of goods sold,\" another said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has clashed with several countries on trade, including the US's biggest business partners. His administration has placed import taxes on $300 billion worth of products so far, prompting retaliatory measures from major economies.\n\nIt may be just the beginning of price pressures within the manufacturing sector. Jeffries economist Thomas Simons said some of the effects may have been masked as businesses try to rush orders ahead of anticipated price increases.\n\n\"According to comments by survey respondents, backlogs are starting to fall, so we may start to see more of the negative effects of the tariffs put downward pressure on the ISM PMI heading into the end of the year,\" Simons said.\n\nEven as an anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month eases some of the most high-profile concerns, the trade outlook remains far from certain.\n\n\"We also need to see significant progress with our European trade partners before the tariff clouds begin to lift,\" Simons added.\n\nTrump, however, asserts tariffs will ultimately help defend the US against trade practices perceived as unfair.

And the overwhelming concern within the sector appears to be rising protectionism.\n\n\"For the consumer, the tariffs are for the most part still an abstract idea, but for manufacturers they are real, and a big problem,\" said Ian Sheperdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said Thursday that its index of national factory activity dropped 2.1 percentage points to 57.7 in October from a month earlier. The decline was largely thanks to uncertainty related to tariffs, according to survey respondents.\n\n\"Mounting pressure due to pending tariffs,\" observed one respondent in the ISM survey. \"Bracing for delays in material from China \u2014 a rush of orders trying to race tariff implementation is flooding shipping and customs.\"\n\n\"Higher costs related to trade tariffs are starting to be passed on to the cost of goods sold,\" another said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has clashed with several countries on trade, including the US's biggest business partners. His administration has placed import taxes on $300 billion worth of products so far, prompting retaliatory measures from major economies.\n\nIt may be just the beginning of price pressures within the manufacturing sector. Jeffries economist Thomas Simons said some of the effects may have been masked as businesses try to rush orders ahead of anticipated price increases.\n\n\"According to comments by survey respondents, backlogs are starting to fall, so we may start to see more of the negative effects of the tariffs put downward pressure on the ISM PMI heading into the end of the year,\" Simons said.\n\nEven as an anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month eases some of the most high-profile concerns, the trade outlook remains far from certain.\n\n\"We also need to see significant progress with our European trade partners before the tariff clouds begin to lift,\" Simons added.\n\nTrump, however, asserts tariffs will ultimately help defend the US against trade practices perceived as unfair.

The ad depicts Bracamontes as the poster child for unauthorized immigration and falsely claims \"Democrats let him into our country ... Democrats let him stay.\"\n\nBracamontes was deported twice for entering the country illegally. When he committed the killings in 2014, he was also not authorized to be in the US.\n\nThe first time Bracamontes was deported was in 1997 under the Clinton administration. A year later, Bracamontes was back in the US and got arrested on a drug charge in Phoenix. He was released for \"unknown reasons\" under Sheriff Joe Arpaio's custody and continued to live in the US for several more years, Yahoo News reports.\n\nArpaio, 85, is a controversial figure with close ties to the president. Trump pardoned Arpaio earlier this year after he was found guilty of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. The former sheriff has often come under fire for his incendiary views on undocumented immigration and gained notoriety for his \"tent city jail,\" which was described by some as a \"concentration camp.\"\n\nBracamontes' second deportation occurred in 2001, during the first year of the Bush administration. Bracamontes managed to enter the country illegally again in 2002, while former President George W. Bush was still in office, and somehow avoided deportation until his eventual arrest for killing the two California police officers.\n\nTrump's new ad also includes clips of unidentified people rioting in unspecified locations, seemingly portraying a migrant caravan heading toward the US border as inherently violent and anarchic.\n\nThe president has repeatedly claimed, without providing evidence, that the caravan is full of dangerous criminals and possibly people from the Middle East.\n\nThe ad ends with the question, \"Who else would Democrats let in? President Donald Trump and Republicans are making America safe again.\"\n\nRead more: Poll suggests Trump voters are more loyal to him than they are to the Republican Party\n\nCritics and other observers, including some conservatives, decried the ad as blatantly \"racist.\" Republican Sen. Jeff Flake called the ad \"sickening\" and \"a new low in campaigning.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Trump has used Bracamontes' story in an ad. A January ad also featured him and accused Democrats of being \"complicit in all murders\" by unauthorized immigrants.\n\nMany drew comparisons to the infamous \"Willie Horton\" ads that ran in support of former President George H.W. Bush against then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in 1988.\n\nWilliam Horton, who was dubbed \"Willie Horton,\" was a convicted murderer serving a life sentence who was permitted to leave prison in June 1986 via a weekend furlough program in Massachusetts. Horton absconded during furlough and in April 1987 raped a white woman and stabbed her white fianc\u00e9e, according to The Washington Post. As governor, Dukakis supported the furlough program.\n\nAt the time, crime was at the forefront of American voter's minds, as brutal drug-related violence was a common occurrence in major American cities like New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC.\n\nSupporters of Bush seized on these sentiments by creating ads that either alluded to or directly referenced Horton's story. One of the ads featured Horton's mugshot, while another portrayed Dukakis as someone who favors prisons with revolving doors. The latter was produced by Roger Ailes, who founded Fox News. However, the Bush campaign did not directly produce the ads.", "In the world of early retirement, money loses its significance \u2014 so say at least four of the early retirees I've talked to.\n\nBut if money doesn't really matter during early retirement and becomes \"unimportant,\" as Brandon of the blog Mad Fientist, who retired early at age 34, previously told Business Insider, how do early retirees decide when money is worth spending?\n\nThe answer is consistent among many: Early retirees prefer to spend money on experiences, not things.\n\n\"Things lose value, but early retirees understand that experiences tend to appreciate within our heads,\" Steve Adcock, the blogger behind Think Save Retire, who retired early at the age of 35, previously wrote in a post published on Business Insider.\n\nHe added: \"Today, I would much rather take an inexpensive vacation to somewhere I love (like Sedona, Arizona, for example) than get stuff wrapped up as gifts. Early retirees are over 'stuff' and have often found that the less stuff they have, the more simple life becomes.\"\n\nHe and his wife give each other \"the gift of experiences,\" traveling everywhere from Key West to Glacier National Park and visiting the Albuquerque Hot Air Balloon Fiesta in between.\n\nFor many early retirees, experiences provide more value for the money\n\nThis is an example of what blogger Mr. Crazy Kicks, who retired at age 34, calls an early retirement lifestyle. The key, he previously said, is maximizing happiness per dollar \u2014 put your money where your heart is, but get the most bang for your buck.\n\n\"Having an early retirement lifestyle doesn't mean depriving yourself, it just means leading a more exciting and fulfilling life that is not dependent on spending large sums of cash,\" he wrote, adding that happiness is often drawn from doing fulfilling things that involve passions, like caring for family, enjoying good food, or pursuing hobbies. It's what he calls the most important part of defining your early retirement lifestyle.\n\nRead more:People retire early for 2 reasons, and neither of them is money\n\n\"Too often we throw money at things because they are important to us without weighing our return on investment,\" he wrote.\n\nHe used holiday gifts as an example. The excitement they elicit is short-lived and burdens loved ones with material junk; making memories through a home-cooked meal or activities can have a more meaningful impact on relationships, he said.\n\nIt's a similar train of thought that helps Emmy-nominated Hollywood producer Travis Shakespeare, who spent a year directing the documentary \"Playing with FIRE,\" in which he interviewed more than a dozen early retirees, decide what's worth \u2014 or not worth \u2014 spending money on. He asks himself one question: \"If I were going to die tomorrow, where will this land on my value scale?\"\n\nWhen it comes down to it, experiences outweigh material items for Shakespeare. He rented a tuxedo for the Emmy's because he doesn't own one, but he splurged on his dream trip to celebrate his 50th birthday on a luxury safari in Tanzania.\n\n\"I was like, 'There's no way I want to walk off this planet without spending three weeks on the Savannah in Tanzania' because that's an incredible experience for a human being to be able to encounter,\" he said.

CBC reports \"Marketplace\" spoke to multiple flight attendants and customer service representatives who acknowledged their responsibility in cleaning these planes but contended there \"simply wasn't enough time to properly disinfect an entire aircraft.\"\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to Air Canada, Porter, and WestJet for comment. WestJet did not respond.\n\nAir Canada had no comment on the story, but did attach in their response to Business Insider an environmental microbiology scientific study that, in-part, concluded, \"In summary, the airplane cabin microbiome has immense airplane to airplane variability. The vast majority of airplane-associated microbes are human commensals or non-pathogenic...there is no more risk from 4 to 5 hours spent in an airplane cabin than 4-5 hours spent in an office, all other exposures being the same.\"\n\nIn their response to Business Insider, Porter said they regularly groom their aircraft to correspond with Canadian Public Health Agency and World Health Organization guidelines, adding that, \"Past Public Health audits of Porter have shown no findings.

The 19-year-old led Real Madrid to its 34th Liga ACB title and 10th EuroLeague title, earning the EuroLeague Final Four MVP award and season MVP honors in both leagues.\n\nOne month after securing the EuroLeague title, Doncic was selected with the third overall pick of the 2018 NBA Draft by the Atlanta Hawks, but he was immediately traded to the Dallas Mavericks for sharpshooter Trae Young. In August, ESPN predicted that he would be the 2018-19 NBA Rookie of the Year, and two months later he began proving himself in the best basketball league in the world.\n\nBut ever since he first dreamed of taking his talents to the NBA, Doncic had one goal in mind: playing against his idol, NBA superstar and newly-minted Los Angeles Laker LeBron James.\n\nHe did that and more in Dallas' heartbreaking one-point to the purple and gold Wednesday night. And after the game, Doncic walked straight to the home locker room and waited outside for a gift from King James himself.\n\nA rep for James brought out a signed number 23 jersey that read \"To: Luka D, God Bless and continue to #StriveForGreatness.\"\n\nHe then posted a photo to his Instagram story:\n\n\"I always wanted his jersey,\" Doncic told the media postgame, per ESPN. \"It was something special to me.\"\n\nDoncic has proven himself more than worthy of his high draft pick through eight games of play in the NBA.

With a 31 point, eight rebound performance against the San Antonio Spurs Monday, Doncic became the third-youngest player to score at least 30 points and eight rebounds in a single game. James and nine-time NBA All-Star Kevin Durant were the only two players to complete the feat at a younger age.\n\nDespite his demonstrated success, Doncic struggled through the beginning of Wednesday night's contest in Los Angeles. He scored just five points through the first three quarters, but a nine-point fourth-quarter performance helped spark a late comeback for the Mavericks. With his team trailing by two and 7.2 seconds left in the game, Doncic sank a baseline floater to tie the game.\n\nDallas ultimately dropped its fifth-straight contest thanks to a foul from Wesley Matthews that sent James to the free-throw line, but Doncic wouldn't let his team's woes dull the memorable moment.\n\n\"It's very special,\" Doncic said. \"I was waiting for this game, and it was very special to me.\"", "After a plateau in the US, subscriptions to streaming services are growing again thanks to a boom in Netflix and Hulu subscribers this year, a report from Ampere Analysis found.\n\nThe report found that subscriptions to SVOD \u2014 streaming video on demand \u2014 services had steadily increased from the third quarter of 2015 until the first quarter of 2017, when numbers began to stagnate.

Meanwhile, AT&T recently announced it would roll out a service next year that would include HBO.\n\nThat could lead to a new form of SVOD bundle \u2014 but Holleran urged caution, saying that the best course of action for streamers is to give users as many options as possible for the best price.\n\n\"I think forcing bundles upon people might not be the best move,\" Holleran said. \"It depends on the price point.

The space capsule carrying the two men ripped away from the damaged rocket, then plunged back to Earth.\n\nThankfully, the two men on board, Nick Hague and Alexey Ovchinin, survived without injury and landed on the ground in Kazakhstan.\n\n\"We knew that if we wanted to be successful, we needed to stay calm, and we needed to execute the procedures in front of us as smoothly and efficiently as we could,\" Hague told The Associated Press.\n\nAfter investigating the incident, Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, determined that one of the rocket's boosters failed and stuck to the main rocket body instead of peeling off. That failure was filmed from a camera attached to the rocket, looking down its body.\n\nAbout one minute and 24 seconds into the video, you can see one of the side boosters stick to the rocket, sending it careening back to the ground because it was too heavy.\n\nRoscosmos has said that a faulty sensor caused the failure and that it believes Soyuz rockets will resume launching in December, when a three-person crew at the International Space Station must return to Earth.\n\nBut the failure is worrisome, since Soyuz is the only human-rated spacecraft used to get people to and from the space station. It's relied upon by NASA, Europe, Russia, and other partners.\n\nSpaceX and Boeing are building new commercial spaceships designed to reach the space station, but they may not launch until mid-2019.\n\nWatch the video of the rocket failure below:", "The organizers of the worldwide Google walkout have now made their demands clear.\n\nIn response to Google's handling of sexual-misconduct claims, employees at more than 60% of worldwide Google offices are participating in a protest walkout on November 1.

Shortly after she turned down his proposal, he met his future wife, Nan Cornell, whom he married in 1953.\n\nThe fact that Rehnquist tried to marry O'Connor came as a surprise to her children.\n\nSon Jay O'Connor told NPR that he and his siblings were \"surprised\" by the fact, but noted that it was \"a different era.\"\n\n\"Dating was pretty innocent in the '50s,\" he said, adding that \"Multiple men proposed to my mom when she was in college and law school, and ultimately my dad was the one who was the real deal.\"\n\nAnd a friend of Rehnquist's said that on his death bed in 2005, he said that Nan was the only woman he ever loved.\n\nO'Connor, 88, announced in October that she was retiring from public life because she was diagnosed with dementia.

Those particles will gladly travel up to six feet away to reach new hosts. Flu viruses can also linger on hard surfaces for as long as 24 hours, just waiting for their next victim.\n\nMaking matters worse, flu viruses spread more easily in the dry, cold air that circulates at this time of year.\n\nVeteran flu expert Richard Webby, an infectious disease expert at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who's part of the elite World Health Organization team that develops the annual flu vaccine, shared his best advice on how to keep the flu at arm's length this year.\n\n\"So, that's an easy one,\" Webby told Business Insider. \"The number one tip is the vaccine.\"\n\n[Read More: How to avoid the flu when your partner or roommate gets sick: 9 simple tips]\n\nWe have lots of hard evidence that vaccines are the best line of defense against the flu\n\nWhile it may not be surprising that an infectious disease pro who helps decide what goes in the vaccine might think his creation is the best prevention strategy, hard evidence suggests he's right.\n\nStudies show that the flu vaccine reduces the risk of death from the flu by more than 50% for kids, and saves anywhere from 200 to nearly 10,000 lives every year, depending on how bad the flu season shakes out.\n\nThe vaccine is more effective some years than others. \"We know the flu vaccine is not the best vaccine that we have,\" Webby said.\n\nLast year's dose was a particularly poignant example of that: it was only about 25% effective against some of the worst strains of the flu, leading to the worst death toll the US has seen in over four decades.\n\n\"But it is effective,\" Webby said, \"and it still is the single most important thing that we can all do.\"\n\nThe flu season this year isn't expected to be as bad as last year's, and the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control suggests circulating flu levels are very low, though it's still too early in the season to say for sure that this will be a mild year. Vaccine experts also agree that the viruses in the air this year are probably better matched to the flu shots being given out. That's another reason it's likely that we won't see a season as deadly as 2017-18, when 80,000 people died.\n\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n\"We lost more children last year from flu deaths than any year before, since we started recording,\" CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield recently told CBS News. \"And a majority of those children were not vaccinated.\"\n\nGetting a flu shot can make you feel a little weird in the hours and days after you get pricked: common side effects include headache, fever, nausea, and achiness. But far from being a bad thing, those mild symptoms are a signal your body is likely developing immunity to new strains of the flu. Think of them as an immune system dress rehearsal for the real fight against the dangerous viruses you may come in contact with later in the season.\n\nYou can create a healthier workspace by staying home when you're sick, and encouraging others to do the same\n\nAside from getting your flu vaccine, another important thing you can do to keep the population healthy this winter is stay home when you feel sick.\n\n\"If you can just reduce the number of infected people you can come into contact with during a flu season, you do clearly reduce your likelihood of getting infected,\" Webby said.\n\nStill, it is nearly impossible to avoid exposure to the flu entirely. Certain people can carry around flu germs while displaying no symptoms, and others have developed immunity to the flu bugs that circulate this year from their previous exposures. This means not every flu virus will get everyone sick, and not every case of the flu will be easy to spot.\n\nWhile there's no way to zero out your risk of getting sick, you can help keep yourself and others healthy by avoiding colleagues when you're sick, telling them to stay home when they're sick, and getting a shot or flu mist to avoid illness in the first place.", "Introducing the Rising Stars of Wall Street.\n\nWhether closing multibillion-dollar investments, making huge trades, or leading the future of crypto, this crop of young finance leaders are making an impact.\n\nIt was hard to pick just 25 people.

He was 68.\n\n\"I basically sat there and bawled my eyes out,\" Lupo told me on the phone, recalling that morning.\n\nLupo said he sat in his chair for over two hours before he did the only thing he knew how to do in that moment.\n\n\"I kicked the stream on, with no alerts, no webcam, no nothing,\" he said. \"I just sat and I played 'Fortnite,' and I talked. I talked for a little bit, and I cried for a little bit. It was the only thing I knew to do to escape from my own mental black hole.\"\n\nLupo, 31, is one of the most popular broadcasters on Twitch, the Amazon-owned service that lets people livestream themselves playing video games, where he is known as DrLupo. Lupo, a native of Omaha, Nebraska, has over 2.5 million followers on Twitch; thousands of people are watching his channel at any given moment.\n\nLupo says he plays video games on Twitch for about 80 hours a week \u2014 a little over 11 hours a day.\n\nLupo is also popular among other Twitch streamers, who showed their support on the morning of his father's death amid the thousands of other messages from fans and viewers.\n\nTwitch is full of smaller, tight-knit communities focused on specific games, but many people watch Lupo regardless of what he's playing, whether it's \"Destiny 2\" or \"Fortnite\" or \"Call of Duty.\" Perhaps that's because so many people, through watching his daily game streams, have come to know Lupo as a person and not just as an entertainer in front of the camera.\n\nOne of Lupo's biggest supporters is Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, the most popular streamer on Twitch and one of the biggest names in the world of gaming.\n\nRead more: Meet Jessica Blevins, the 26-year-old wife and manager of the most popular video-game player in the world right now\n\nLupo and Blevins met while playing each other in \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.\" Lupo perfectly lobbed a grenade that killed Blevins, who messaged him afterward offering to play \"duos\" together.

He's the youngest of four \u2014 all boys \u2014 and his three older brothers turned him onto tabletop games like \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and \"Warhammer 40,000.\" Lupo even remembers his mother, Regina, playing \"Tetris\" with him on his NES every morning before taking him to kindergarten.\n\nBut their father rarely joined in on the fun. He was more into solo activities, like playing Solitaire or reading one of the hundreds of science-fiction and fantasy books he collected over the years. And even when he played games, Lupo said, he chose single-player titles like \"The Sims.\"\n\n\"He always kind of watched from afar,\" Lupo said. \"He didn't like fast-paced stuff because his brain just wasn't wired that way. Gaming was never a thing for him when he was younger.\"\n\nLupo said his father grew to appreciate games, though, especially in his later years and as his son pursued a career on Twitch. On one occasion, Lupo, his father, and a handful of family members all played a game called \"Starbound\" together \u2014 and his father had a blast.\n\n\"I stood up a server, and we all had fun playing it,\" Lupo said. \"It took my dad until he was in his 60s to ever play something with us like that. It was silly and fun, and I do desperately miss that.\"\n\nLupo said his father didn't understand Twitch at first, but he gradually came to appreciate it when he saw how many people were watching his son play games like \"Fortnite.\" The day before his father's death, Lupo called him from a Target store and told him he'd planned on streaming a phone game that weekend. \"Where was this when I was your age?\" Lupo recalled his father asking him. \"How did you get so lucky?\"\n\n\"I could tell he was super proud of me, and that meant a lot,\" Lupo said. \"There's a big portion of my career where I would've loved to hear what his thoughts about it were.\"\n\nJamie Olsen Photography\n\nIn 2007, Lupo was heading over to his friend's duplex to watch a movie, the \"Star Trek\" film \"The Wrath of Khan,\" but the RiffTrax version, where audio commentary (from the people who made \"Mystery Science Theatre 3000\") is played over the movie for comedic effect.\n\nBut when Lupo arrived, he spotted a woman outside yelling at her car because it wouldn't start.\n\nIt was Samantha.\n\nOne brief meeting and 11 years later, Samantha and Ben are happily married \u2014 for eight years now, since 2010.\n\n\"We still make the same jokes, still act the same way \u2014 we're still the same people, and I'd be frustrated actually if that ever changed,\" he said. \"Being married to my best friend is still being married to my best friend. But now she gets to watch the stream, and she's part of the business.\"\n\nIn addition to her work as a photographer, Samantha manages her husband's Twitch channel, fielding inquiries and overseeing the entire DrLupo operation. The two also have a son, Charlie, 3.\n\nTwitch\n\nCharlie has already appeared on Lupo's Twitch stream numerous times, in cameos and as an occasional participant in games like \"Fortnite,\" and Lupo said he was excited to get his son more into video games when he's old enough to appreciate them.\n\n\"I'm making him play through my generations,\" Lupo said. \"If you stick a kid in front of all of these super-high-resolution games with tons of polygons \u2014 put him front of 'Fortnite' \u2014 he won't appreciate back when it was 8-bit and all the audio was done on MIDI.

If he's not an idiot, it's easy,\" Lupo said. \"If he's serious about it and wanted to give it a try once he was of age, and he actually had intent to do it and do something positive with it, then it would be ridiculous of me to say no.

Its marketplace's gross merchandise volume (GMV) for the quarter totaled almost $21.5 billion, growing 5% YoY.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nHowever, this is a steep drop from the 11% YoY increase seen last quarter, marking consecutive quarters of slowing growth in the metric. Prior to this trend, eBay's marketplace GMV growth rose or held steady for four straight quarters, peaking at 13% YoY.\n\nThe e-tailer's marketplace growth has been hurt by existing eBay users who are slow to adapt to changes to its shopping experience. eBay is making changes to its marketplace to bolster its long-term performance, namely emphasizing products more than individual listings.\n\nBut, because existing shoppers aren't adjusting to these changes quickly, it hindered some of eBay's plans to scale features in Q3, CEO Devin Wenig said on the company's earnings call.\n\nNew users aren't having issues with the changes because they have no prior familiarity with eBay or associated expectations, but the changes are making eBay different from what long-time shoppers are used to. eBay is planning to roll out changes faster for new users and slower for existing ones going forward to account for this.\n\neBay intends to focus on customer acquisition through marketing to combat this issue. Since new users are responding better to eBay's new tactics, they have the potential to boost its marketplace GMV growth faster than existing users, and the company plans to target its marketing toward these users to attract them specifically.\n\nThis could pay off since eBay is \"well recognized, but not always well understood,\" according to Wenig, and it may be easier to educate new customers about what eBay is and what it wants to be, rather than changing the perspectives of existing shoppers.\n\nAt the same time, eBay expects significant growth to come from segments other than marketplace transactions, just like Amazon, suggesting that these top e-tailers' future growth may lie outside of retail. Wenig pointed toward payments and advertising as notable growth opportunities for eBay, and it's possible they could help supplement eBay's slowing marketplace growth.\n\nAmazon has also seen its growth decelerate in its online store sales segment, with segments like AWS and \"Other,\" which includes advertising, growing much faster. These e-tailers have tremendous revenue from their marketplaces, making it hard to consistently improve their performances. As a result, they may be looking to invest elsewhere to propel their growth in the future, but they still won't be walking away from their huge retail businesses.", "If you're looking for a prestigious internship, you'll want to consider working at Google, Apple, or Facebook \u2014 at least, that is, according to the 2019 Vault Internship Rankings.\n\nCareer-intelligence platform Vault asked more than 120 companies with internship programs to distribute their internship survey to past and present interns.

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nGoogle and robotics company iRobot have announced a partnership aimed at improving smart home technology using data generated by iRobot's smart vacuums, according to The Verge. The new collaborative effort will give Google access to data on the layout of consumers' homes that's collected by devices like iRobot's Roomba.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nFrom this data, Google will be able to more easily automate in-home actions and group devices by room, which will enable simpler voice-based control and help boost smart home adoption overall.\n\nSmart vacuums already make their own maps of the home in order to navigate the space more easily. A device like a Roomba uses a combination of measurements based on wheel rotations as well as low-resolution camera images to build a composite map of the inside of an owner's home.\n\nThis map lets the device track where it's been when operating autonomously, while also allowing the user to mark the different rooms in an app and send the vacuum to a specific room.\n\nAccess to this data will help Google improve its smart home management products. In particular, such information will allow Google to automate the addition of new smart home devices to a home network \u2014 if a consumer sets up a smart light bulb, for example, Google's home management system will be able to identify where it's located and automatically add it to a group for that room.\n\nThis could also help the company to personalize the Google Home Hub screened smart speaker by giving the device information to visualize for consumers where their various smart home devices are situated in the home and what their current status is.\n\nThe partnership with iRobot is just one way that Google or competitors can achieve this end; Wi-Fi signals can be used to a similar effect, so these companies can also turn to router vendors or third parties, though they don't have permission to map out homes the way smart vacuums do, which provides an obstacle.\n\nBut it's unclear if consumers want companies like Google and Amazon, its chief competitor in the US smart speaker space, to have detailed maps of the inside of their homes. Consumers share huge amounts of data with these sorts of companies already, but a lack of trust in these vendors to maintain privacy is the top reason why consumers who don't own a smart speaker haven't purchased one as of yet.\n\nBuilding up services based on having even more data isn't likely to convince more people to adopt the devices, though Google won't use data from this partnership with iRobot to target ads, according to Michelle Turner, the director of its smart home ecosystem. Google is stressing the voluntary nature of this mapping tie-in, which will help deliver greater value to those who want to opt in, but will also mean that the impact will be muted.", "A woman spent six days in the Arizona desert after her car veered off a highway, surviving injuries from the crash and getting rescued after someone noticed a broken fence, authorities said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Department of Public Safety said two state transportation workers and a rancher were corralling a cow along a highway on October 18 when they saw a break in a fence outside the historic Western town of Wickenburg, about an hour's drive northwest of Phoenix.\n\nThey noticed that car tracks went off the edge of the road and through the fence on the edge of the hill. As they inspected the damaged fence, they spotted a mangled car, 50 feet (15 meters) down, entangled in a mesquite tree.\n\n\"We got down there as quick as we could, hollering out if anyone could hear us,\" Arizona transportation worker Zach Moralez told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"No response.\"\n\nA DPS trooper responded but did not find anyone in the vehicle. The group followed human tracks to a riverbed for about 500 yards (457 meters) and found a 53-year-old woman, who has not been publicly named, severely dehydrated and with serious injuries.\n\n\"She was in the fetal position, and there was no movement,\" Moralez said. \"We started asking her a bunch of questions: 'How long have you been here? Do you have any pain?'\"\n\nMoralez's brother, a rancher named David Moralez who was also part of the rescue, told NBC News that the woman was wearing a T-shirt, shorts, and flip flops, and that she was suffering from broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, and a head injury.\n\n\"I don't know if she could have made it there another night,\" he said.\n\nDavid Moralez said the woman asked the group for help, saying she had been screaming but no one heard her.\n\nDespite being somewhat lethargic and in pain, she was alert enough to open her eyes and answer questions. Zach Moralez said she was dirty from sleeping on the ground and had facial trauma \u2014 likely from the crash.\n\nShe was airlifted to a hospital about 15 minutes later, ending her six-day ordeal in a rural area. It's not clear how she survived, but temperatures were relatively mild \u2014 dropping to the mid-50s at night and reaching the low 80s during that time period.\n\nAccording to the trooper, the woman recounted how she was driving on US 60 on October 12 when she lost control of her car.\n\nThe vehicle went through the fence and dropped 50 feet (15 meters), landing in the tree, where it remained suspended above the ground, DPS said.\n\nShe stayed inside her car for several days before trying to walk toward some railroad tracks to find help, but she was too weak to make it, authorities said. She was airlifted to a hospital.\n\nDPS spokesman Quentin Mehr said the woman is declining all media requests and did not give any details about her current condition.\n\nDPS Director Col. Frank Milstead commended the transportation workers and the rancher.\n\n\"The diligence of the ADOT crew and teamwork of everyone involved is exemplary and to be commended,\" he said in a statement to NBC. \"Due to their outstanding efforts, this woman's life was saved.\"\n\nMoralez said it's a good feeling to know that he helped make the difference between life and death for someone.\n\n\"I believe people are put in the right place in the right time,\" he said.", "Slumping global equity markets in October have surprised investors. The biggest puzzle is what caused the sell-off. What do markets know now that they didn't know a few months ago?\n\nTrade wars and their potential escalation? Uncertainty about US mid-term elections? China slowing? Fed hikes? Italy's fiscal rule-breaking? Angela Merkel's political woes? A strong dollar? Higher oil prices? Hard Brexit?\n\nNope, nothing new there.\n\nAbout the only 'new news' in October is the Saudi Arabia imbroglio. Yet few investors ascribe the global equity meltdown to Saudi Arabia alone.\n\nWhile it is fashionable to blame large market sell-offs on 'technicals' \u2014 algorithmic trading or index trackers dumping ETFs \u2014 that can't be the whole story. If the market decline isn't fundamental, then opportunity exists to buy at knock down prices. Yet the reluctance of stock pickers to move in suggests they sense something is awry.\n\nMore likely, we've entered 'post-peak.' The best of growth and earnings is over. If so, then the litany of troublesome policies and politics begins to matter.\n\nPut differently, when things are good and getting better, it's easy to climb the wall of worry. When things stop getting better, the metaphor becomes Wiley Coyote in thin air a few feet from the edge of another wall \u2014 the face of the Grand Canyon.\n\nBut is it true that we've passed peak growth and peak earnings?\n\nIt looks that way. Consider first global growth.\n\nIn the US, economic activity peaked mid-year. Softness is now showing up in housing and autos. Real short rates are edging back toward positive territory (deflated by core inflation). The boost to corporate spending from tax cuts and deregulation is happening now. It will fade next year. Corporate taxes won't be cut again and the low hanging fruit of deregulation by executive order has been picked.\n\nMost important, the US economy is at full employment, with trend growth around 2.5%, not 4.2% (the Q2 rate of GDP growth), nor 3.5% (the Q3 rate of GDP growth). From here, either growth slows or inflation accelerates. And if the latter happens, the Fed will hike rates even faster to ensure growth slows.\n\nCan China replace the US as the world's growth locomotive? That's unlikely for two reasons. First, China gets less bang for an additional buck (renminbi) of easing. Second, China is now relaxing credit policy to offset the risk that exports will shrivel as trade conflict with the US intensifies. That's hardly reassuring. China is girding itself for the worst, not preparing for compromise.\n\nAs for Europe, Japan or the rest of the emerging economies the lesson is age-old. They follow, not lead, the global business cycle. Investors could spend less time waiting for Godot.\n\nStill, the bulls might counter, what about profits? Aren't we in a golden age of profitability? Surely that will lure investors back into equities.\n\nTrue, for the US and Japan the past decade has seen profit share in GDP, return on capital and a host of other earnings metrics scale heights never before seen in the post-war period.\n\nUnfortunately, the best is past in the US. The share of corporate profits in US GDP peaked at 12.6% in Q2 2012, where it then hovered for a few years. Over the last two years, however, it has been falling and is now nearly two percentage points below its cyclical peak.\n\nWhy? Largely because firms have already squeezed as much as they can out of labour \u2014 capturing the bulk of productivity gains for the bottom line. Wages are beginning to rise, while productivity lags. Energy costs are also rising, as is the cost of debt finance. Lastly, as various companies have recently noted, tariffs are pushing up prices for selected inputs.\n\nPost-peak US profits is unnerving because in 2018 US equities have been the only game in town. So will any equity market replace the US?\n\nJapan is quietly enjoying a remarkable decade-long rise in corporate profits \u2014 but can anyone imagine Japan, alone, leading global equity markets higher? Europe and emerging markets have consistently failed to deliver on earnings and without an (unlikely) acceleration of economic growth that won't change.\n\nIn sum, when times were good and getting better, markets could tolerate shabby politics and dubious economic policy, as well as Fed tightening. Post-peak, that's proving too much to ask.\n\nSo while it would be nice to think that the rest of the world can grab the market leadership baton from the US, or that value can replace growth as the driver of equity returns, that's unlikely so long as Washington, London, Rome, and a few other places don't start putting wrongs to right.", "Thomas Peter/Getty\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said tariffs on another $257 billion worth of imports from China are ready to go.\n\nThat round will be more easily felt by the average American household, analysts say.\n\nAt the same time, lower oil prices and planned general tariff cuts in China may help mitigate inflationary pressures there.\n\nAfter months of trade escalations between Washington and Beijing, headlines about incoming tariffs on Chinese products may seem almost routine.

There's nothing worse than trying to scale Dubrovnik's breathtaking city walls on a day when four or five cruise ships-full of people are trying to do the same thing.\n\nUsing CruiseTT helped me avoid crowds as I visited Split, Dubrovnik, and Hvar Island in Croatia and Kotor, Montenegro, all top cruise ship stopping points. I simply booked my dates for each place based on the days when less ships would be in port. It made all the difference.\n\nUnfortunately, I forgot to consult a cruise ship calendar this past summer when I was visiting Mykonos, the Greek island best known as a glamorous destination for the world's wealthy.\n\nIt looked a little something like this:\n\nMykonos Town, overrun with tourists at sunset. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nWhile it would likely have been impossible to avoid every cruise ship, I had the distinct misfortune of spending two days on the island when there were five cruise ships in port. You could barely move in the Old Town it was so crowded.\n\nIf I had come two days later, there would have been one or even zero cruise ships in port.", "Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nOctober was a rough month for billionaires in the tech sector, who saw their net worth plummet as stocks took a hammering.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, the CEOs and founders of the most popular tech companies \"FAANG+BAT\" lost $61 billion in October.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index plunged 9.2%, posting its worst month since the financial crisis.\n\nAnd among the hardest hit were the \"FAANG+BAT\" stocks - Facebook (-7.7%), Apple (-3.1%), Amazon (-20.2%) Netflix (-19.3%), Google (-9.8%), Baidu (-16.9%), Alibaba (-13.6%) and Tencent (-14.1% in Hong Kong).\n\nThe list below provides details of the estimated net worth of some of tech's richest CEOs and founders:", "This Thanksgiving, more dinner guests than ever will be dipping under the table, looking for online shopping deals on their phones.\n\nSmartphones are predicted to drive 35% of all purchases on Thanksgiving, according to a holiday forecast by Adobe Analytics.

The startup has said the service, which begins with an online questionnaire about a client's finances, will not be restricted to its existing investors.\n\nThe move highlights customers' demand for a human touch in digital wealth management. A substantial number of potential clients reach up to a point on the online registration to invest in Nutmeg, but then abandon the process, Lisa Caplan, the startup's head of financial advice, told This is Money. This, according to Caplan, is because potential clients want a knowledgeable voice to get them over the fear of investing.\n\nNutmeg is not the only automated investment platform to have discovered that customers want human interaction when it comes to managing their money. In January, Scalable Capital, the BlackRock-backed robo-advisor, launched phone and face-to-face consultation services following high demand from clients. The launch of these services is a move away from the strictly automated robo-advisory propositions championed at the outset by these startups.\n\nIn addition to reducing signup friction for Nutmeg, the hybrid model will add a new revenue stream.

Since then, Tata has done a marvelous job of keeping Jaguar relevant. That's meant stunningly high-performance cars like the F-Type, but also Jag's first-ever SUV, the F-Pace, which arrive for the 2017 model year.\n\nDesigned by Ian Callum, that vehicle was a stunner. But the insatiable market for luxury crossovers wouldn't be sated by a single SUV with a Jaguar badge on the grille. Thus, the smaller E-Pace arrived for 2018. Now Jaguar has the crossovers it needs to compete head-to-head, segment-by-segment, with BMW, Mercedes, Audi, and Lexus.\n\nThe big issue for Jaguar isn't that the company can't do SUVs. With the F-Pace, it showed it can. The question is whether it can consistently translate Jag's storied DNA \u2014 Enzo Ferrari named the classic E-Type as the most beautiful car he'd ever seen \u2014 to the more awkward genre of the crossover. Because let's face it, these are basically just large hatchbacks, or lifted station wagons. You aren't supposed to drool over them.\n\nYou are supposed to drool over Jags, however. All Jags. And that extends beyond the aesthetics. You're also meant to relish the driving part. Speed and beauty have always found themselves conjoined \u2014 such is the destiny of all leaping cats.\n\nWe were intrigued to see if Jaguar could pull off a repeat performance with the E-Pace, after the F-Pace blew us away.

It made only $300 per screen on average. That's one of the worst box-office takes of all time for a movie opening wide on 600 screens or more.\n\nAccording to Variety, the movie has had a bumpy road to theaters amidst a wave of legal battles.

A handful of advertising players including Brian Sheth and Robert Smith (Vista Equity cofounders) and WGI Group (founded by Jonah Goodhart, Noah Goodhart, and Michael Walrath) also participated in the round.\n\nThe actor and filmmaker Edward Norton and Daniel Nadler founded Edo in 2015 to match up granular TV ratings with purchase-intent data through machine learning.\n\n\"We had seen that the legacy media companies were getting disrupted by Netflix and Amazon who were using organic data capabilities as significant advantages,\" Norton said. \"At the same time networks were facing the assertion by Google and Facebook that digital advertising was more effective, and none of the legacy measurement players were really helping them challenge that with sophisticated data.\"\n\nEdo's goal is to amass a huge library of data pulled from TV networks to help determine how likely someone is to buy a product after watching an ad, based on data about how similar ads have performed in the past.\n\nThe company claims to have a database with access to 47 million TV airings across 80 categories of advertising and 2,100 brands. Edo's clients include ESPN, Turner, NBCUniversal, Paramount, and Lionsgate.\n\nRead more: Ad execs are deeply skeptical that TV measurement will ever catch up to digital \u2014 putting comScore and Nielsen on notice and billions on the line\n\n\"Our ultimate goal is to be an alternative currency to the way that TV advertising is bought and sold,\" Edo CEO Kevin Krim said. \"We can run very advanced data-science models to develop expected norms of responses,\" Krim said. In other words, Edo can construct a baseline estimate to compare an ad's performance with.\n\nAccording to Krim, after marketers run a few dozen airings of an ad, Edo can analyze how that piece of creative compares against its database and can determine whether it is overperforming or underperforming.\n\nMovie marketers run lots of ads without a lot of data behind them\n\nFilm studios are an example of an entity that could benefit from measurement like Edo's. Movie marketers spend millions of dollars blasting commercials across multiple networks leading up to a film premiere.\n\n\"A Star Is Born\" had a massive ad campaign behind it. Warner Bros\n\nAccording to Krim, a movie marketer can run 4,000 to 6,000 TV ads weeks before a film premieres with dozens of creatives. Edo scores each of those ads to determine which creative and networks are most likely to increase the chance that a person will buy a movie ticket.\n\n\"They're a real crucible of invention because they have to deliver millions of consumers [to a movie theater] on a single weekend or their product will be an economic failure,\" Krim said.\n\nOr take the example of an automaker launching a campaign for an SUV for the first time. Edo can dig through data to understand what types of creative and placements have worked well in the past for other automakers.\n\nThe TV measurement industry is rapidly changing\n\nEdo is one of a handful of tech companies eyeing the $70 billion TV industry. As more ad budgets get funneled to digital, marketers are increasingly looking to plug data and technology into their ad buys to serve targeted TV ads and then measure how effective they are in getting people to take an actions like buying something or visiting a website.\n\nFirms like VideoAmp, iSpot, and Simulmedia are also all working to innovate in TV advertising. VideoAmp, for example, uses software to help brands determine how they should divvy up ad budgets between TV and digital. And Simulmedia rolled out a marketplace this week aimed at helping small, digital-first brands buy TV placements through automated software.\n\nFor Edo, the company wants to work with both buyers and sellers.\n\n\"We've done a ton of research that allows us to give very high-fidelity views into how every creative that a TV marketer has on-air is effective at driving consumers to be more likely to buy the products that are being advertised,\" Krim said.", "The new iPad Pro is definitely the best tablet Apple has ever made, but it's still not perfect.\n\nIn 2010, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs demonstrated the iPad's capabilities by sitting down on a big comfy chair with it, on stage in front of hundreds of people, and showing what it was like to read a book or browse the web on the iPad.\n\nRecently, though, Apple has pushed the idea of using the iPad for doing work.

It complements the areas Hims has gotten into for men, including selling generic Viagra and hair-loss medications.\n\nHealthcare startups like Hims are increasingly expanding into new treatment areas. Simple Contacts, whose first business provides eye exams and ships contact lenses, is moving into birth control. Ro, the startup behind men's health company Roman now wants to help you quit smoking through a new business called Zero. And the company behind hair-loss brand Keeps in October expanded into migraine treatments.\n\nRead more: Investors are betting $660 million that companies that ship Viagra and hair loss pills to your door is the future of medicine \u2014but some doctors are worried\n\nInvestors are wagering that consumers will be increasingly willing to shop for healthcare the same way they buy mattresses or fancy wool sneakers online. To date, Hims has raised $97 million in funding, including a $50 million series B raised in June.\n\nHow it works\n\nAn ad for Hers at Wall Street. Lydia Ramsey/Business Insider Through the new service, Hers will link up consumers to doctors who can prescribe the medications online.\n\nBut the company won't take insurance for any of its products. While insurance often doesn't cover drugs for hair loss or sexual desire, health insurers are required to cover birth control under the Affordable Care Act. Through Hers' service, birth control pills will cost about $30 a month, including a doctor's visit, getting the prescription through the mail, and additional follow-up services.\n\nThe Hers service will be going up against companies that do take insurance, including Nurx and Simple Health, When Business Insider's Erin Brodwin tested out Nurx, the entire experience was free when using her insurance.\n\n\"One of the things we learned pretty early on is that insurance is exceptionally complicated,\" Hims CEO Dudum said. He hopes that by providing drugs at a price patients will be able to afford, it will increase access to the prescriptions.\n\nA 'more refined' sister brand\n\nThere's at least one big difference between Hims and Hers. Instead of the tongue-in-cheek advertisements that the Hims brand is known for, Hers will take a different direction.\n\nHers brand lead Hilary Coles told Business Insider that within the company, they've been calling it \"Hims' more refined, badass older sister.\"\n\nAddyi was the first treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Marketed as a drug that could increase the libidos of women who struggle with chronically low sex drives, Addyi quickly earned a predictable nickname: the \"female Viagra.\"\n\nInitially approved in 2015, the drug re-launched in June, at which point Sprout, the company behind Addyi, decided to offer it directly to consumers.\n\nThat is, while women can still go to their doctor's office if they choose, they also have the option to speak with a physician virtually to get the drug prescribed. The prescription can then be shipped by pharmacies including PillPack, a pharmacy startup that mails prescriptions and is now owned by Amazon, or sent to the woman's local pharmacy.\n\nThe medication will still be available that way, and women can also visit doctors in person for the prescription. Addyi will be available for $99 a month, in line with the cash pay maximum the company set when it relaunched the drug.\n\nWhile the women's health and wellness markets may look over-saturated, Dudum said that as the team looked into it there weren't as many options on the medical side.\n\n\"The ability to get actual prescription medicine just did not exist,\" Dudum said.\n\nGoing directly to consumers\n\nStartups like Hims have attracted $662 million in venture funding in the past 12 months, by Business Insider's calculations.\n\nOlivia Reany/Business Insider\n\nThe healthcare industry as a whole has been jockeying to stay competitive as companies realize that patients, used to the consumer experience they're getting from Amazon and Netflix, have higher expectations for their doctor's visit.\n\nThat's been a driving force behind mega-deals like Amazon's acquisition of PillPack and CVS Health's merger with Aetna. On-demand healthcare options like urgent care have gained in popularity too.\n\n\"There are other ways of actually reaching these people and having their demand be met by a new healthcare or consumer offering,\" Ambar Bhattacharyya, the managing director of Maverick Ventures who leads the firm's healthcare investments, including a stake in Hims, told Business Insider.\n\nSee also:", "If you're wondering which companies have the most attractive internship programs, it's probably best to ask interns themselves.\n\nVault, a website that provides employer rankings and reviews, asked more than 12,000 current and former interns to rate companies based on how desirable they are to land an internship with.

Plus, he knew she was working on the issue.\n\nIn \"Imagine It Forward,\" Comstock writes that she also made a point of coming to Immelt's meetings with strongly articulated arguments.

They are looking instead for key hallmarks of diseases that may reside across larger networks of brain activity and cause everything from the forgetfulness of schizophrenia to the seizures common in epilepsy.\n\n\"The traditional target-based drug discovery approach is broken,\" Sean Escola, the co-founder and CEO of System1, told Business Insider. At the same time, \"people are hungry for innovation.\"\n\nThe idea that sick systems \u2014 rather than simply sick molecules or sick cells \u2014 cause psychiatric disease has only recently begun to yield new research efforts. It may also be one of the reasons why some drug giants are returning to neuroscience despite previous failed attempts to create new drugs for diseases like depression. In October, drug giant Pfizer resurrected its brain division by launching the company Cerevel Therapeutics. Allergan and Johnson & Johnson have also made recent rebounds into the area with investments in depression drugs inspired by the club drug ketamine.\n\nSeveral big-name investors are betting that System1's system-level approach could work, having poured a total of $25 million into the startup.\n\nThey include Pfizer's venture arm, as well as bi-coastal venture firm CRV and the Longevity Fund, the first VC firm dedicated entirely to anti-aging startups. Frederic Kerrest, the COO and co-founder of the enterprise identity software company Okta, serves on System1's board of directors and was joined by CRV's George Zachary and Pfizer's Margi McLoughlin.\n\nCurrent attempts at creating drugs could be missing the forest for the trees\n\nA close-up of one of System1's cerebral organoids showing the cortical structures (green). The cortex is involved in higher-order brain functions like perception, behavior, and cognition. System1\n\nFor decades, researchers who study psychiatric diseases have been coming up with new drugs by homing in on what they believe are broken or sick molecules or cells that may be causing the symptoms of the disease. But in about 90% of cases, some part of their thesis about those molecules was wrong in the first place, and large amounts of time and billions of dollars have been wasted.\n\nStill, most of our current drugs are a product of this model.\n\nThe most popular drugs for schizophrenia, for example, target dopamine \u2014 a molecule that's thought to play a key role in memory and pleasure. But these drugs fail to help many people. One reason is that many schizophrenia symptoms, from hallucinations to memory loss, could be the result of a much more fundamental set of cross-brain issues.\n\nBut current drug development approaches in neuroscience don't probe these system-level problems. Instead, they focus on one or two isolated components of the disease. Escola, who's also an assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, believes that's a tragic oversight. He thinks it could also explain why so many medications fail to help patients.\n\n\"It is very possible that for some psychiatric disorders, you don't have any sick molecules or cells, you just have sick wiring diagrams,\" Escola said.\n\nPut another way, that could mean that many of our previous attempts at creating drugs for psychiatric diseases like epilepsy and schizophrenia have been missing the forest for the trees.\n\nTo address that problem, Escola and his co-founder Saul Kato, a professor of neurology at the University of California in San Francisco, aim to mine the activity across their mini brains for signs of disease that could be happening at a much more foundational level of the illness.\n\n\"We're not measuring one thing,\" said Escola. \"We're measuring many interactive features across many different levels of biology.\"\n\nIf they make a promising discovery in their work with mini brains, Escola and Kato's researchers will need to further test their idea and eventually run clinical trials in people. Escola wouldn't provide Business Insider with a timeline on that work, however.\n\nRows of little tiny brains\n\nA System1 researcher examines an organoid sample. System1\n\nSystem1 is using its fresh funding to grow as many three-dimensional mini brains as possible.\n\nFor now, the stem cells used in the process come from nearby banked stem-cell lines designed for research, but Escola said they've already exhausted all of the global suppliers. Their next sources will likely come from research institutions and universities where they've developed close relationships.\n\nThe researchers then spend months studying the organoids using software powered by machine learning. They hope to end up with several of what Escola calls \"deep phenotypes,\" or characteristics of diseases that can be seen across entire systems of activity as opposed to just inside specific molecules or cells.\n\n\"It may be the case that the pathology is most clear at a complex, network level rather than at the level of individual molecules,\" Escola said.\n\nSeveral startups in the drug development field are using a similar approach to System1's data analysis component. Silicon Valley-based startup Numerate is using machine learning to optimize small-molecule drug discovery and better predict toxic side effects.\n\nInsilico, a startup out of Baltimore, is using what's known as \"deep learning\" to assess data on the genome, epigenome, and microbiome-level. And London-based startup BenevolentBio feeds data from clinical trials and research papers into an AI-powered algorithm that helps reveal deeper relationships between diseases and drug candidates.\n\nBut System1 is the only company doing it with their own source of biological data \u2014 the cerebral organoids.\n\n\"One way you could conceptualize our company is we've got our own data-generating process wrapped inside of a machine learning team,\" said Escola.", "Getty Images News\n\nSpotify beat on profits and sales.\n\nSubscriber growth was in line with its own expectations.\n\nThe company's fourth-quarter revenue guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates.\n\nShares dropped more than 8%.\n\nWatch Spotify trade live.\n\nSpotify was sinking Thursday, down more than 8%, after giving disappointing revenue guidance and subscriber growth that was in line with its own expectations.\n\nThe world's biggest paid-music service on Thursday said it earned \u20ac0.23 per share, well above the \u20ac0.24 loss that was expected by the Bloomberg consensus.

I've been writing about healthcare for years, and I'm married to a doctor.\n\nYet I found the choices confusing, and had a tough time figuring out which plan would be the best one for me. So I asked a couple experts (and the internet) to help me pick the right plan.\n\nHere's what I learned.\n\nThe standard advice for picking a health-insurance plan goes something like this: choose one with a monthly cost (known as a premium) that you can afford and that covers the drugs and doctors that you need.\n\nIf you're relatively healthy and don't expect to go to the doctor much, pick a plan with higher out-of-pocket costs and lower monthly premiums. If you need to see a doctor more or take prescriptions regularly, you might want a more expensive insurance plan that costs more each month.\n\nComparing insurance plans \u2014 it's complicated\n\nIt turns out, though, that actually picking the right plan is a lot more complicated.\n\nI asked David Anderson, a researcher at Duke who used to work at a health-insurance company, to take a look at my options. (He also wrote up a blog post on how he picks his own family's insurance \u2014 I found it really helpful, and it inspired the picture at the top of this article.)\n\nI'm thankfully pretty healthy, so I don't really go to the doctor or take prescriptions much at all.\n\nAnderson ran a couple simple scenarios for me: one in which I have to go to the emergency room for something relatively simple, at a cost of $1,000. And one where something terrible happens (getting hit by a bus, let's say), and I end up needing $50,000 of medical care.\n\nAnderson found something surprising. In either case, the plan where my total costs would be lowest was my company's \"high deductible\" plan. That might not always be the case, depending on the specific medical care that I needed. But it's worth digging in to understand why \u2014 and why I still didn't choose my company's cheapest plan.\n\nHere's part of the analysis that Anderson did. I've rounded some of the figures because Insider asked me not to reveal too many details of our plans. All of these costs are for a single individual who gets all of his or her care from doctors and hospitals that accept Insider's health insurance (what's known as being \"in-network\").\n\nOlivia Reaney/Business Insider\n\nYou'll often hear people talking about insurance \"deductibles.\" A deductible is the amount of money you have to spend out of your own pocket on medical care, before your health insurance kicks in at all. But you'll notice that in the chart above, I don't mention deductibles at all.\n\nInstead, I'm focusing on another feature that's just as important. That's the out-of-pocket maximum, which is a term for the total amount your insurance plan will require you to spend on medical care in a single year. Once you spend more than that amount, the health insurance will cover the rest of your care.\n\nRead more: The former CEO of GE pinpoints the moment he realized healthcare was his problem\n\n(When your spending is higher than your deductible, but below your out-of-pocket maximum limit, you'll still be required to pay some of the costs of seeing a doctor or picking up a prescription. This can be a flat rate of $25 or $50 to go to a clinic, known as a copayment, or it can be calculated as a percentage of the cost of a visit, in which case it's called coinsurance.)\n\nA note: If you don't have access to a health-policy researcher to run this analysis, one quick trick is to add up your total annual premium and the maximum out-of-pocket limit of your insurance choices. That'll give you a quick sense for how much you could wind up paying, in total, if something really bad happens.\n\nWhat does a deductible do, anyhow?\n\nYour health-insurance company should also do a similar analysis for you, though it's typically buried in the middle of a document that you get from HR or from the insurance company, called the Summary of Benefits and Coverage.\n\nAbove, you can see that the high-deductible plan (called an HSA plan, which refers to a kind of savings account that goes along with it) has a big financial head start on the other options, because Insider offers it to employees for free \u2014 there's no annual premium. And the company will give you a few hundred dollars to spend toward your medical care, too. The next-cheapest plan costs nearly a thousand dollars a year.\n\nI should note that our high-deductible plan is actually pretty generous. It limits the total amount that you could end up spending on healthcare in a given year to about $3,000.\n\nAbove that, all your care is free. The main caveat is that the limit only applies to care that you get from doctors who are in-network with the insurance.\n\nAll in all, it's a really good choice for a lot of people. Margaret Bowani, who oversees the health insurance here, told me that she picked it for her own family and that it's also popular with a lot of the company's younger employees.\n\nAshish Jha, a physician and health-policy researcher at Harvard, has written about his own experience using a high deductible plan for his family. I'd definitely recommend reading his article before going with a high-deductible plan.\n\nAvoiding a financial catastrophe\n\nI didn't end up picking the high-deductible plan. One big reason to have insurance is to reduce the chance of a financial catastrophe. And on that score, I was worried the HSA plan would come up short.\n\nThere are three other plans listed.\n\nI'm pretty much ignoring the EPO plan \u2014 it might be a good option for someone who needs to see a doctor regularly and is willing to stay within a more limited network of clinicians. The plan doesn't offer any coverage if you go to a doctor or hospital that isn't included in its network. It's a lot more expensive than the HSA plan and wouldn't make sense for me because I don't need much care.\n\nThe two PPO plans offer a broader selection of doctors than their less expensive counterparts. The \"High PPO\" plan has a lower deductible and out-of-pocket spending limit, but its upfront cost is much higher. Since I'm hoping I won't end up needing much medical care, that's not a good option for me, either.\n\nThat leaves the \"Low PPO\" plan, which is the one I ended up picking.\n\nThe PPO plans, in addition to their broader networks, will also pay for out-of-network care, though it would be really expensive. The HSA and EPO plans don't cover any care provided by doctors or hospitals that aren't in their network, except in an emergency.\n\nWhy I chose a more expensive plan\n\nIt's tough to tell which doctors are being left out of the smaller network \u2014 you can look up individual clinicians or facilities, but it's impossible to get a more holistic view of who's in and who's out.\n\nI've heard enough horror stories about people getting five- and six-figure bills for care their insurance didn't cover, and the data backed up my concern that it's a really big problem. While nothing short of a change in federal law can stop that from happening entirely, I figured that picking a plan with some out-of-network coverage could help (New York has some state laws that protect me, too).\n\nDahlia Remler, a health economist at the City University of New York's Baruch College, has also written about why out-of-network coverage can be important if you're sick, based on her own experience trying to find a neurosurgeon to treat a rare kind of tumor.\n\nFor what it's worth, both Anderson and Tom Loach, the director of carrier relations at the insurance-shopping site eHealth, told me I'd probably be fine with the more limited coverage.\n\n\"You really can't make a bad decision because you're not going to use it anyway,\" Loach said.\n\nStill, I figured I'd opt for better protection. So I'm spending about $1000 a year for the \"Low PPO\" plan.\n\nHopefully, when next year comes around, I still won't be going to the doctor much, and that thousand dollars will have been money wasted.\n\nBut I know there's a small chance it'll have been well worthwhile.

At the time of the UK sandbox debut, the country's Financial Conduct Authority said the purpose was to provide firms with:\n\nThe ability to test products and services in a controlled environment;\n\nReduced time-to-market at potentially lower cost;\n\nSupport in identifying appropriate consumer protection safeguards to build into new products and services;\n\nBetter access to finance;\n\nHong Kong Securities and Futures Commission chief Ashley Alder floated the plan on Thursday, according to Reuters. It's a shift in stance after the Asian financial hub's regulator in February said it would crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges that operate without a license or violate local securities laws.\n\nHong Kong can look to the UK for inspiration. This year, the FCA took its sandbox idea a step further, starting a sandbox especially for the fintech industry after the success of the 2016 program.\n\nFCA board member and Director of Strategy and Competition Christopher Woolard said in March that the agency has worked with some 500 firms, of which 70 has been in depth via the fintech sandbox, according to Trustnodes.\n\nHe said he saw an \"aspiration for global standards\" in terms of regulations. Some 90% of the companies that participated in the first round of applications for the UK sandbox, including Blockchain companies and startups, have \"gone on to market,\" while many firms also find it easier to get access to funding, Woolard said.\n\nIn February of this year, the FCA granted a London-based blockchain startup a Small Electronic Money Institution (EMI) registration, allowing it to create a blockchain-based currency within the existing regulatory framework, Cointelegraph reported.\n\nThe FCA in March gave crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase an e-money license, allowing Coinbase to issue e-money and provide payment services in the UK, Cointelegraph said.\n\nCharlotte Crosswell, CEO of Innovate Finance, said it is important to dispel the myth of regulation being a hurdle for young firms to overcome, according to Crowdfund Insider.\n\nShe said earlier this year: \"Regulators can, on the contrary, play an active and positive role in encouraging innovation by giving unique business models 'permission to play' in the highly competitive financial services sector.\"", "The Bank of England left interest rates on hold for another month on Thursday, as had been widely expected, but cut the UK's growth forecast for the next two years.\n\nIts nine-member Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to leave rates on hold at 0.75%.\n\nAny outcome other than no change from the meeting would have been a significant surprise to markets.\n\nRates are widely expected to increase further in the coming years, but the timing of any rate hikes remains unclear, and the next move in rates will almost certainly not happen until next year. Any moves are going to be dependent on the progress of Brexit, the bank said.\n\n\"Were the economy to continue to develop broadly in line with the November Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate,\" the MPC's summary of its meeting said.\n\nAlongside the decision on Thursday, the bank released its quarterly Inflation Report, which provides an update of its forecasts for overall economic growth and inflation.\n\nThose forecasts included downgraded GDP growth for both 2018 and 2019, with 2018 growth now expected at 1.3% compared to 1.4% at its previous forecast, and 1.7% in 2019 compared to 1.8% previously.\n\nBritain faces an uncertain economic future as Brexit looms. The British government remains adamant that it will strike a deal, and says one is 95% complete, but the exact shape of that deal isn't entirely clear.\n\nShould Britain fall out of the EU without a deal, the Bank of England would likely be forced into extraordinary measures \u2014 similar to those taken after the initial Brexit vote \u2014 as a means of protecting the UK from any negative shocked.\n\nThe bank has repeatedly said that it could either increase or decrease interest rates in the event of a no deal Brexit, and Carney reemphasised that on Thursday.\n\n\"The monetary policy response will not be automatic and can move in either direction,\" he said during a press conference.\n\n\"There are scenarios where policy would need to be tightened in a no deal,\" he added.\n\nCarney continued, however, by saying that there is \"little monetary policy can do to offset\" the worst impacts of a no deal Brexit.\n\n\"The economic outlook will depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular the form of new trading arrangements, the smoothness of the transition to them and the responses of households, businesses and financial markets,\" the summary of the MPC's meeting said.", "Even President Donald Trump isn't prepared to say the Republican Party will hold the House of Representatives in Tuesday's midterm election.\n\nIn an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Air Force One on Wednesday, Trump expressed confidence that his party would keep control of the Senate but stopped short of saying the same for the House.\n\n\"I think we'll win the Senate, and I think we're gonna do well on the House,\" Trump said.\n\nYou can watch the interview segment below:\n\nPolls have indicated that Democrats have a strong chance of taking control of the House but that Republicans are likely to keep the Senate.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday seemed certain that Democrats would retake the House.\n\n\"Let me say this: Up until today, I would've said, 'If the election were held today, we would win,'\" Pelosi said on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\n\n\"What now I'm saying is, 'We will win.'\"\n\nWhen asked about Pelosi's comments by CBN, Trump said Pelosi had \"been losing for a long time.\"\n\n\"She's been saying she's gonna win for a long time, she hasn't been doing too well,\" Trump said. \"We'll see what happens.

On Thursday, the Silicon Valley database startup announced that it raised $80 million in Series E financing, led by One Peak Partners and Morgan Stanley Expansion Capital. This doubles Neo4j's total funding to $160 million in all.\n\nWhen Neo4j was founded 11 years ago, it introduced a relatively novel concept: graph databases, something that Emil Eifrem, Neo4j's CEO and co-founder, has been evangelizing his entire career. Now graph databases are growing in use, and even Amazon Web Services has entered the space with its own AWS Neptune.\n\n\"Amazon doesn't go into markets that aren't real,\" Eifrem told Business Insider. \"They only choose to invest if it's there. Their customers have told them loudly and clearly they want a graph database. That by and large is a good thing.\"\n\nSo what, exactly, is a graph database?\n\nFor context, today's widely-used databases are relational databases, which have been around since Oracle pioneered them in the 1970s. Relational databases organize information into tables by category, much like a spreadsheet.\n\n\"I grew up as a professional programmer in the 90s,\" Eifrem said. \"When you put an architecture together, the only database choice was Microsoft, IBM, Oracle. For all these years, we reflexively put any data in a relational database.\"\n\nBut these aren't really built for finding links between two data points among massive databases \u2014 the system basically has to comb every single entry looking for commonalities, which takes up time and computer memory.\n\nOn the other hand, graph databases are built so that one can easily find the connections. While relational databases look like spreadsheet tables, a graph database looks a little bit more like connect-the-dots. Graph databases are especially effective for uses like fraud detection and automatic recommendations, where the information doesn't fit neatly into a traditional database.\n\nWhen detecting fraud, graph databases make it easier systems to detect when, for instance, someone's credit card was used simultaneously in both New York and Los Angeles. Likewise, with recommendations, people can see recommendations based on previous activity, like products they previously bought or phrases they recently searched.\n\nA simple example of a graph database. It's all about the relationships between data points. Neo4j\n\nIt's like how children learn, Eifrem says. His youngest daughter just turned one year old and is starting to learn new words, like \"mom\" and \"dad.\"\n\n\"Every new thing she learns, she learns by relating it to stuff she already learns,\" Eifrem said. \"'Dad' is sort of like 'mom.' Machines are the same way. The context is how things are related to each other. There's a lot of applications where graphs are critical for AI.\"\n\nThe future of graph databases lies in artificial intelligence, Eifrem believes, and that's how Neo4j plans to spend its new cash influx. Neo4j has been working with eBay on a shopping bot to recommend products to customers based on what they've bought in the past. Research organizations are even using Neo4j's databases to study cancer.\n\n\"We help the world, but we don't do it ourselves,\" Eifrem said. \"We're tool builders. We enable the world to do it.\"\n\nAnd Neo4j has been able to help with some compelling, world-changing projects already in its existence.\n\nWhen NASA engineers were working on the the Orion spacecraft, which could take astronauts to Mars in the future, they struggled with figuring out why the returning capsule wasn't flipping correctly when it lands on the water. But using Neo4j's databases to scope the problem, they finally solved the problem within hours. Relational databases are certainly useful, Eifrem said, but in many cases, graph databases are more powerful.\n\nRead more: A new way to search for data is helping NASA's biggest brains save millions and get to space faster\n\nNeo4j even helped journalists crack the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers, which showed how the world's elite hid away their massive wealth in offshore bank accounts. The graph databases helped reporters and researchers map out all the connections between various offshore bank accounts. After the Panama Papers went public, former Iceland prime minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson stepped down.\n\n\"That's a pretty massive political impact we had,\" Eifrem said. \"They say for investigative journalism, there's a pre-graph database era and a post-graph database era.\"\n\nBy making these kinds of connections, too, it's easier to make predictions. You can learn more about something based on what it's connected to. For example, if your friends on Facebook lean politically to the left or to the right, then it's likely you do as well. Similarly, if lots of people click on a new TV after adding a video game console to their shopping cart, then a shopping website can assume that you will, as well.\n\nWith more companies like Amazon entering the graph database space, Neo4j might have a bit more competition, but the idea that Eifrem has been trying to evangelize all these years will also be louder and clearer.\n\n\"I will never say that relational bases are dead, and go away,\" Eifrem said. \"Graph is for when there's connections. We're frequently a thousand times faster.\"\n\nSee more: How a nerdy Swedish database startup with $80m in funding cracked the Paradise Papers", "Introducing the Rising Stars of Wall Street.\n\nWhether closing multibillion-dollar investments, making huge trades, or leading the future of crypto, this crop of young finance leaders are making an impact.\n\nIt was hard to pick just 25 people.

Britain currently relies on a system of so-called \"passporting,\" but will likely need a new framework for its relationship after Brexit.\n\nPassporting rules allow EU finance companies to sell their services across the 28-member bloc with a local license, rather than getting a license to operate in each member country where it does business. Its use is tied to membership of the European Single Market. Britain is likely to leave the Single Market as part of Brexit and will no longer be able to do business using these rules once it has left the EU.\n\nRead More: Europe is closing a trading loophole that banks were relying on to cope with Brexit\n\nThe Times reports that the new relationship will be based around the principle of equivalence.\n\nUnder the equivalence framework, the EU acknowledges that the legal, regulatory, and supervisory regime of a non-EU country is as good as its own and allows that state access to the financial services sector within the bloc. Countries like Singapore and the USA use a similar system to trade financial services with the EU.\n\nThe UK government has consistently maintained that it will seek to improve on existing requirements for equivalence of rules between the EU and outside countries.\n\nThe EU was initially sceptical of these plans\u2014 claiming it did not allow the bloc complete autonomy \u2014 but has softened in recent months, and now appears to have conceded that this system is the best way forward.\n\nUnder the proposed system, The Times says equivalence rules will be tweaked, meaning that current system, whereby \"market access can be withdrawn unilaterally with only a month's notice\" will be removed, with the time period extended, and the enforcement of the equivalence principles falling under the governance of the main EU-UK trade deal.\n\nSenior EU officials, however, poured water on reports of a breakthrough, with chief negotiator Michel Barnier describing media reports on the subject \"misleading.\"\n\n\"Misleading press articles today on #Brexit & financial services.

Phillip Dengler, head of editorial and content marketing for BestBlackFriday.com, told USA Today that this was the most confirmed closures it has had at this point in the year compared to previous years.\n\nWhile some retailers are still hoping to capitalize on Black Friday sales early by opening during Thanksgiving, some have likely pulled back because the famous shopping day doesn't carry the same weight it once did.

Former President Jimmy Carter, an Abrams supporter and former Georgia governor, garnered significant attention already this week with a personal plea that Kemp resign as secretary of state, Georgia's chief elections official, to ensure public confidence in the results of what's expected to be a close race.\n\nThe blitz underscores the high stakes in one of the defining contests of next week's midterms, as Abrams vies to become the first black female governor in American history, while Kemp tries to maintain the GOP's dominance in a state Democrats believe is on the cusp of becoming a presidential battleground.\n\nThe appearance by Winfrey, among the world's wealthiest and most well-known black women, is a significant coup for Abrams, who needs to maximize her support from nonwhite voters but also from liberal white women. All of those demographics overlap with Winfrey's fan base, and she will hit them all with events in Republican-leaning Cobb County and heavily Democratic DeKalb County, both within miles of downtown Atlanta.\n\nThough sometimes mentioned as a 2020 presidential candidate, Winfrey has demurred on her intentions. Her most visible foray into electoral politics was as an outspoken supporter of Obama, her fellow Chicagoan, when he first won the White House in 2008.\n\nTrump's scheduled appearance Sunday sidelined the last debate scheduled between Kemp and Abrams. Atlanta's WSB-TV confirmed late Wednesday that a long-planned matchup at 5 p.m. Sunday had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled before polls open Tuesday.\n\nThe two campaigns agreed weeks ago to debate in WSB-TV studios. But Kemp's campaign said the president's schedule takes precedence \u2014 and he's coming to Macon, about 100 miles south of Atlanta, to hold a campaign rally with Kemp at 4 p.m.\n\nKemp's campaign attempted to blame the cancellation on Abrams, saying the Republican nominee was willing to find a new time but Abrams refused.\n\nWSB-TV released a lengthy statement detailing its efforts to find a new time slot, but making clear that it was Kemp's withdrawal from the original plan that set the cancellation in motion.", "A Pentagon official is urging Taiwan to boost its defense spending and \"modernize its military\" in the face of Beijing's growing military prowess.\n\nDavid Helvey, the US principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs said at a conference in Anapolis, Maryland, that the island \"must have resources to modernize its military and provide the critical material, manning and training needed to deter, or if necessary defeat, a cross-strait invasion,\" the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nThe official also took a shot at China for what they said was an attempt to \"erode Taiwan's diplomatic space in the international arena while increasing the frequency and scale of [The People's Liberation Army] activity.\"\n\n\"Taiwan's current efforts will falter,\" he warned, unless Taipei increases its military spending and improves its readiness for direct confrontation.\n\nHelvey's comments will be seen by many as a direct response to China's President and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Xi Jinping who only last week told the command which oversees the tense South China Sea to \"concentrate preparations for fighting a war.\"\n\nRead more: China's commander-in-chief has ordered the military command overseeing the South China Sea to prepare for war\n\nChina's Minister of Defense Wei Fenghe also warned that China will not give up \"one single piece\" of its territorial holdings, adding that \"challenges\" to its sovereignty over Taiwan could lead China to use military force.\n\nChina's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang responded on Wednesday to enhanced exchanges between the US and Taiwan.\n\n\"China is firmly opposed to any forms of official exchanges and military contacts between the US and Taiwan,\" he said, calling on the US to \"stop its official exchanges and military contacts with Taiwan, and stop selling arms to Taiwan.\"\n\nBeijing has taken a strong stance against official US contact and arms sales to Taiwan.

He ended the season with another knee injury.\n\nRose told The Athletic's Shams Charania that he didn't have any contract offers going into the 2017-18 season before LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers called him, offering a deal. Rose took the contract, but had an up-and-down year that included an extended absence away from the team to evaluate his future. He was eventually traded to the Utah Jazz, who cut him, then signed with the Wolves, where he provided some good minutes for former Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau. He re-signed with the team this past summer.\n\nAll of which is to say, Rose's NBA career seemed very much in doubt in recent years. After a stunning breakthrough game on Wednesday, Rose was emotional.\n\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, his teammates mobbed him, as Rose fought back tears.\n\nThen, during his postgame interview, Rose got choked up, saying he had \"worked his ass off\" to keep his career alive.\n\nAfter the game, Thibodeau alluded to Rose's tough path back, saying it was the first summer in five years that Rose didn't have to go through rehab.\n\nThe NBA has already seen four 50-point games in less than a month. But at the onset of the season, few could have predicted that Rose, who was nearly out of the league at various points in recent years, would be a candidate to go for the rare achievement in the NBA.", "The top cyber and communications spy in Australia has explained why Huawei and ZTE have been barred from the country's 5G network and China is unimpressed.\n\nMike Burgess, the director-general of the Australian Signals Directorate, said in Canberra on Monday that the ban on Chinese telecom firms like Huawei Technologies and ZTE was in Australia's national interest and would protect the country's critical infrastructure.\n\nIt is the first time the nation's chief cyber spook has publicly explained the move since August when Australia made the call to block the Chinese telecom giants from supplying equipment to the nascent Australian 5G network.\n\nBurgess said that the stakes \"could not be higher\" and that if Australia used \"high-risk vendor\" supplies then everything from the country's water supply and electricity grid to its health systems and even its autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles would be compromised.\n\nIn response, a miffed, but totally unsurprised China on Tuesday again called on Australia to drop \"ideological prejudice\" and \"create a level playing field for Chinese companies doing business in the country.\"\n\nAustralia is a member of the so-called \"Five Eyes\" intelligence-sharing alliance alongside Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US, and while Australia is also a close trading partner, there is certainly an understanding to follow the US on sensitive intelligence issues that can compromise the alliance.\n\nSo that obviously puts the kibosh on allowing any access to critical infrastructure for any companies aligned with the Chinese state.\n\nAnd since the Chinese government has been leveraging the state's position, role and function within its growing portfolio of world-beating mega-tech companies, the decision out of Canberra to err on the side of caution \u2014 and Washington \u2014 would have surprised precisely no one.\n\nBut that didn't stop China from responding the way it did.\n\nIn a restrained retort from the English language tabloid, The Global Times, China accused Canberra of being part of a US-led global conspiracy to leave Chinese tech companies behind.\n\n\"Australian officials and think tanks in recent days continued to raise security concerns over Chinese companies' operations in the country and have made accusations about China stealing its technologies, in what Chinese analysts say is an attempt to, in collaboration with other Western powers, derail China's steady rise in telecom and other technologies,\" the Global Times noted.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a press briefing on Tuesday, that \"the Australian side should facilitate the cooperation among companies from the two countries, instead of using various excuses to artificially set up obstacles and adopt discriminatory practices.\"\n\nRead more: China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system \u2014 here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you\n\nBack in August Marise Payne, the Australian foreign affairs minister, said the move was not targeted specifically at Huawei and ZTE, but applied to any company that had obligations clashing with Australia's national security.\n\nIn response, China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement chilling in its brevity: \"The Australian government has made the wrong decision and it will have a negative impact to the business interests of China and Australia companies.\"\n\nChina is Australia's largest trading partner and 30% of Australian exports end up in the Middle Kingdom, it's a bit of a fraught relationship when the US is also the isolated Pacific nation's most important and closest military ally.\n\nHuawei is the largest maker of telecom equipment worldwide, and in Australia for that matter too. But its sales here are still a fraction of the broader economic ties between the two countries, and it is China that has historically been unwilling to open much of its own telecom markets to foreign companies.\n\nDescribing Australia's ban on Chinese telecommunication companies as \"discriminatory\" and based on manufactured \"excuses,\" China on Tuesday called on Australia to drop its \"ideological prejudice\" and \"create a level playing field for Chinese companies doing business in the country.\"\n\nIn the annals of majestic propaganda, it's low-key bluster coming as it does from the world's first digital dictatorship, as Business Insider UK's Alexandra Ma describes here.\n\nIt's just that not getting your tech-giants invited to global infrastructure parties is one of the unforeseen costs of setting up the greatest, most powerful intelligence-collection systems ever devised.\n\nThat success makes it hard for the Chinese government and its state-owned media to credibly look surprised, hurt, or bewildered when such a decision is made.\n\nRead more: Australia's former foreign minister let slip how casually easy it is for China to tell another country what to do\n\nChina's vast data-collection platforms \u2014 WeChat alone has more than a billion users \u2014 are harvesting ever-deeper and more granular material on behalf of the state.\n\nThat's great news for China's state machinery when it comes to monitoring the population, but it's a double-edged sword too, and wielding it has its price.\n\nAccording to Danielle Cave, a senior analyst at the Australian Security Policy Institute's International Cyber Policy Centre, requiring Chinese citizens, organisations and companies to support, cooperate with and collaborate in intelligence activities, of course, comes at a cost to China.\n\n\"And that cost will be the international expansion plans of Chinese companies\u2014state-owned and private\u2014 which have been well and truly boxed into a corner.\n\n\"The CCP has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion. The suspicion will be deeper in countries that invest in countering foreign interference and intelligence activities, Cave wrote earlier this year in The Strategist.\n\nMost developed countries, including Australia, fall into that group and will come to fear the potential application and reach of China's technical successes.\n\nBut then again, there are a good few states out there that could be willing to risk being watched by China, if they can use China's tech to watch their own populations.\n\nFor now the Global Times insists that \"such accusations are baseless.\"\n\n\"They are in line with the Australian government's overall approach toward China \u2014 a tougher approach that (is) derived from suspicion about China rise's (sp) that they perceive as threat, a fantasy to contain China's further development and ideological prejudice against China.\"\n\nIt might be infuriating, but taken from this perspective it is a mark of sheer awe and respect for China's technocratic achievements that Australia has balked at letting Huawei loose inside its critical networks.", "It's big, it's bronze, and it's brand new.

Of that amount, about 20% will be spent online, according to the report. That's up from about 18% last year and just 12% in 2014.\n\nBut e-commerce's share will be even higher next year, hitting 22.4% of retail sales, according to Morgan Stanley. Overall core retail sales are only expected to grow only about 1% next year, much slower than e-commerce is expected to grow. That means online retail's gains will largely come at the expense of brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nThe pace is increasing\n\nThat's bad enough, but the bigger problem for brick-and-mortar retailers is that the pace at which online stores are gaining share in the retail market has been increasing in recent years.\n\nRead more: Amazon has spooked its investors \u2014 these 4 charts show why its growth is slowing\n\nEarlier this decade, e-commerce was gaining about one percentage point of market share each year.

In 2014, it rose another 1.1 percentage points.\n\nBut in 2016, it gained about 2 percentage points of market share. This year, Morgan Stanley expects it to gain 2.3 percentage points and then to add another 2.4 percentage points next year.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nPerhaps most worrisome for retailers, e-commerce sales tend to spike in the fourth quarter. The holiday period tends to be the most important time of year for retailers, because it's when they typically see the lion's share of their sales. The fourth quarter can often be the key factor in whether a retailer posts a profit or a loss for the year.\n\nOnline sales saw a big boom in the fourth quarter last year.

The woman claimed she met Weinstein at an event, and then three days later, went to his apartment in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan for what she believed was a business lunch.\n\nThe woman claimed she informed Weinstein she was only 16-years-old before entering his apartment.\n\nWeinstein allegedly promised he would acquire a role for the woman in a movie, but never delivered after she rejected his sexual advances, BuzzFeed News said, citing the complaint.\n\nThe court filing went on to allege that Weinstein \"threatened and pressured\" the woman.

He was 80.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants announced McCovey's death, saying the fearsome hitter passed \"peacefully\" in the afternoon \"after losing his battle with ongoing health issues.\"\n\nA former first baseman and left fielder, McCovey was a career .270 hitter with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs in 22 major league seasons, 19 of them with the Giants. He also played for the Athletics and Padres.\n\nMcCovey made his major league debut at age 21 on July 30, 1959, after dominating the Pacific Coast League that year. He played alongside the other Willie \u2014 Hall of Famer Willie Mays \u2014 into the 1972 season before Mays was traded to the New York Mets that May.\n\nIn his debut, McCovey went 4 for 4 with two triples, two RBIs and three runs scored in a 7-2 win against Philadelphia \u2014 and that began a stretch of the Giants winning 10 out of 12 games.\n\nMcCovey batted .354 with 13 homers, 38 RBIs, five triples and nine doubles on the way to winning NL Rookie of the Year.\n\n\"You knew right away he wasn't an ordinary ballplayer,\" Hall of Famer Hank Aaron said, courtesy of the Hall of Fame. \"He was so strong, and he had the gift of knowing the strike zone. There's no telling how many home runs he would have hit if those knees weren't bothering him all the time and if he played in a park other than Candlestick.\"\n\nHe had attended games at AT&T Park as recently as the final game of the season.\n\nFormer San Francisco Giant Willie McCovey smiles before the team's baseball game against the San Diego Padres in San Francisco. Ben Margot/AP\n\n\"For more than six decades, he gave his heart and soul to the Giants,\" Giants President and CEO Larry Baer said. \"As one of the greatest players of all time, as a quiet leader in the clubhouse, as a mentor to the Giants who followed in his footsteps, as an inspiration to our Junior Giants, and as a fan cheering on the team from his booth.\"\n\nMcCovey had been getting around in a wheelchair in recent years because he could no longer rely on his once-dependable legs, yet was still regularly seen at the ballpark in his private suite.\n\nWhile the Giants captured their third World Series of the decade in 2014, McCovey returned to watch them play while still recovering from an infection that hospitalized him in September '14 for about a month.\n\n\"It was touch and go for a while,\" McCovey said at the time. \"They pulled me through, and I've come a long way.\"\n\nEven four-plus decades later, it still stung for the left-handed slugging McCovey that he never won a World Series after coming so close. He lined out to end the Giants' 1962 World Series loss to the Yankees.\n\n\"I still think about it all the time, I still think, 'If I could have hit it a little more,'\" he said Oct. 31, 2014.\n\nIn 2012, he said: \"I think about the line drive, yes. Can't get away from it.\"\n\nMcCovey was born on Jan. 10, 1938, in Mobile, Ala. He had spent the last 18 years in a senior advisory role for the Giants.\n\n\"Every moment he will be terribly missed,\" said McCovey's wife, Estella. \"He was my best friend and husband. Living life without him will never be the same.\"\n\nMcCovey had a daughter, Allison, and three grandchildren, Raven, Philip, and Marissa. McCovey also is survived by sister Frances and brothers Clauzell and Cleon.\n\nThe Giants said a public celebration of McCovey's life would be held at a later date.", "Steve West, the Republican candidate vying for a House seat in his state's 15th Congressional District, lost the support of two of his three adult children, who are urging Missourians not to vote for their father.\n\nEmily and Adam West pointed to what they called their father's \"racist\" and \"homophobic\" views, The Kansas City Star reported Tuesday.\n\nWest is best known throughout the state as a right-wing political commentator on his radio show, YouTube channel, and website.\n\n\"I can't imagine him being in any level of government,\" West's daughter, Emily, told The Star on Monday. \"He's made multiple comments that are racist and homophobic and how he doesn't like the Jews.\"\n\nWest's son, Andy, backed up his sister's assertion on Tuesday, telling The Star that \"his ideology is pure hate.\"\n\nAfter West claimed a decisive victory during the state's Republican primaries in August, The Star put together a list of what it said were several bigoted remarks West has discussed on his shows.\n\nRead more: 6 siblings of an Arizona Republican congressman endorsed his Democratic opponent in a scathing campaign ad\n\n\"Looking back in history, unfortunately, Hitler was right about what was taking place in Germany.
