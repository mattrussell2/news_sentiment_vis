And for years, employees bought in.\n\nOn Thursday, however, workers of the Alphabet Inc. unit who took part in a walkout at the company\u2019s offices around the world signaled a crisis in faith\u2014one that, if widespread, could cause reputational harm, potentially affecting Google\u2019s standing as an aspirational workplace, risk experts and analysts said.\n\n\u201cI definitely thought Google was a company that was holding itself to a higher moral standard,\u201d said Jon Cohen, a 28-year-old Google software engineer in New York, who took part in Thursday\u2019s protest. \u201cThe last year or so, it\u2019s just been shown to be untrue.\u201d\n\nRecent employee activism at Google has been in response to a New York Times article last week, which detailed how the company protected three senior executives over the past decade after they were accused of sexual misconduct, including one who received a $90 million exit package in 2014. Google declined to comment on details in the Times story.\n\nEmployees said they were protesting a workplace culture they felt protected perpetrators of sexual misconduct. Many voiced anger and disappointment in a company they once thought was different from other big corporations.\n\nMr. Cohen and others also have taken issue with the company\u2019s efforts to work with the Chinese government to build a censored search engine.\n\nThat has added to his anger, he said. Suddenly, Google was \u201cnot being the kind of company that I thought it was when I joined it,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\n\nOrganizers asked the company to improve transparency in the reporting and handling of sexual misconduct, \u201cend pay and opportunity inequity,\u201d and elevate the role of the chief diversity officer.\n\nHow Google responds is critical for a company \u201cbuilt on human capital and nothing else,\u201d said John Wilson, Cornerstone Capital Group\u2019s head of research and corporate governance.\n\n\u201cGoogle hires people who can work anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if employees don\u2019t trust the company will have their backs, it will impact Google\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate employees.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for comment, Google sent a video of an interview with Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai.\n\n\u201cAt Google we set a very, very high bar and we clearly didn\u2019t live up to our expectations,\u201d he said in the interview, which was conducted Thursday at a New York Times conference. \u201cAnd which is why we felt it was important to express our support for the employees today.\n\n\u201cAnd the first step you take in these things is to acknowledge and apologize for past actions, for the pain they caused,\u201d he added.\n\nThe spotlight on Google is particularly bright because the company has made its culture such a significant part of its allure, said Anthony Johndrow, chief executive of consultancy Reputation Economy Advisors.\n\n\u201cThey built this mythology as being this great place to work and used that to build their external reputation,\u201d Mr. Johndrow said. \u201cYou need to get it right in-house first, and that is coming home to bite them pretty hard.\u201d\n\nThe situation highlights how crucial internal reputation can be to a company. A recent study by management consulting company Accenture PLC calculated a perceived material loss of trust from stakeholders, including employees, had cost more than half of the companies analyzed as much as $180 billion in revenue.\n\n\u201cIf you want a high performance culture, you need a high trust culture,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cUltimately, there has to be trust in the people you work with every day with and that starts at the top.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAny sign that the company is mistreating its employees will impact that trust. Consumers are buying an image as much as a product. We\u2019re talking about a company whose motto is: \u2018Don\u2019t be evil.\u2019\u201d\n\nThomas Kneeland, a Google software engineer, said there is a sense among employees that they work at a special place with a mission to change the world.

The ads on Stories grab attention because they take over the entire screen of the phone, offering marketers a large, interactive canvas for their photos and videos, ad buyers say.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe flip side is an ad format that is uncommon outside of Snapchat, which pioneered the Stories format.\n\nThe \u201cfirst thing to get push back on in production meetings\u201d is shooting ads vertically, to fit the way users hold their mobile phones, said Mark Sytsma, associate director of paid social at Huge, a digital ad agency.\n\nThere are other considerations particular to Stories ads, such as the need to create photos and videos that instantly attract users\u2019 attention and prevent them from tapping the screen to skip ahead. \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of a users\u2019 thumb clicking through the story very quickly,\u201d said Wesley MacLaggan, senior vice president of marketing at Marin Software , an ad-management platform.\n\nFacebook declined to comment for this article, pointing to executives\u2019 comments on the earnings call and elsewhere.\n\nThe more time users spend in interacting with Stories, the more opportunity there is for Facebook to serve ads. Yet advertiser demand for new formats can lag user engagement as they attempt to figure out how to drive the best results from them, which can initially lead to lower prices in the auction-based ad environment.\n\nThe cost of 1,000 user impressions on Facebook Stories, which only rolled out globally to all advertisers in September, is around $4, compared with $5 on the news feed, according to marketing technology company 4C Insights.\n\nThe experience of Instagram, where Stories arrived earlier, suggests that the price of Facebook Stories advertising will eventually catch up to feed ads. The CPM\u2014advertising parlance for the cost per thousand ad impressions\u2014for an Instagram ad in either Stories or the feed was roughly $4 over the past month, a 4C spokeswoman said.\n\nDepending on the specific audiences that brands are looking to target, the CPMs on Instagram Stories can run into the $20 range, said Huge\u2019s Mr. Sytsma.\n\nAnd Marin Software clients\u2019 spending on Instagram Stories grew to 25% of their Instagram outlay in the third quarter of this year from 8% a year earlier, Mr. MacLaggan said.\n\nThe percentage of Facebook spend directed toward Facebook Stories remains a \u201cfraction of a percent,\u201d he said.\n\nTo help close the gap between consumers and advertisers, Facebook is offering clients so-called Stories School education sessions to marketers and their agencies.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Ad Manager tool may also benefit Stories ads in the long run. It lets marketers easily buy inventory across its products, including the main app, Instagram and its Audience Network, which runs ads across outside apps and websites. Buyers can tick boxes to send their creative work across Facebook\u2019s entire portfolio, without having to buy each separately. As the Stories ad format continues to gain popularity on Instagram, the Ad Manager tool may encourage more buyers to purchase Stories ads on Facebook\u2019s other platforms.\n\nStill, the news feed isn\u2019t going away, with 1.5 billion users logging into Facebook every day.\n\nFor some clients, Stories ads are driving more engagement, such as swiping up to learn more about a product, than ads in the feed, according to Courtney Blount, group director at MDC Partners media planning and buying agency the Media Kitchen. But the feed still offers the chance to reach more people.\n\nWe \u201ccontinue to use both and keep both within our mix,\u201d Ms. Blount said.\n\nWrite to Lara O\u2019Reilly at lara.o'reilly@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nMore than 1 billion Stories are shared daily on Facebook.
