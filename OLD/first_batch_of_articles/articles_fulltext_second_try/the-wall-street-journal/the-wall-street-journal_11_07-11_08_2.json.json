PG -0.75% , General Motors Co. and Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nThe ANA study, which was conducted by corporate investigative firm K2 Intelligence, found rebates and other nontransparent practices were \u201cpervasive\u201d in the U.S.\n\nNow, in an industry white paper released Thursday, the ANA said if these practices are found to be fraudulent, \u201ccriminal charges can be brought against the media buying agencies and those executives and employees who were involved.\u201d\n\nThe report laid out federal crimes that it said are likely at the center of the investigation, such as mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and racketeering. The \u201cprimary\u201d offenses likely to be at issue are mail and wire fraud, the report said.\n\nThe 2016 ANA study found that ad agencies used the buying power of their clients for their own benefit. It found agencies\u2019 suspect practices included receiving cash rebates from media sellers for reaching spending thresholds and not returning those funds to clients.\n\nThe white paper said, \u201cIf two or more employees agreed to hide, divert or conceal earned rebates and cause a false report to be sent to an advertiser, a conspiracy may have taken place.\u201d\n\nA call to the American Association of Advertising Agencies wasn\u2019t immediately returned.

Still, the white paper said, \u201cNo one has been accused or charged with any crimes and no one is accusing anyone of criminal behavior.\u201d\n\nThe FBI is seeking to talk to marketers that have already investigated their media-buying firms and have found indications of fraud, the white paper said.\n\nMr. Wood is urging advertisers to review their agency contracts and to conduct an investigation to determine if they have been victimized. Only after that process is complete should a marketer consider cooperating with the FBI, he said.\u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t know they were a victim of the fraud, they are not in a position to help them collect restitution,\u201d he said\n\nWhile the news of the investigation is worrisome for the ad business, the ANA white paper said that there could be some benefits for marketers if they cooperate, such as more transparency in the industry and possibly financial restitution for advertisers that have been harmed.\n\n\u201cIf advertisers sit on the sidelines and don\u2019t engage in self-help to determine if they were defrauded, they may lose out on restitution down the road, if charges are brought,\u201d said Steven A.
