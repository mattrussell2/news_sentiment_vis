Now the 52-year-old says he pulls steady 40-hour workweeks for a taxpayer-financed housing program that repairs damaged residences.\n\nHis wages have nearly doubled, too, thanks to a new minimum-wage law enacted last summer by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, coupled with a surge in demand for construction labor across this struggling U.S. territory. Mr. C\u00f3rdoba spent his summer days fixing roofs and windows and installing toilets, wash basins and cabinets in houses mostly in eastern Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria first made landfall.\n\nThe construction workforce, estimated at roughly 33,000 before Hurricane Maria, will need to double to keep up with demand to rebuild roads, houses and other infrastructure damaged in last year\u2019s storm season, said Emilio Colon-Zavala, president of the Puerto Rico Builders Association. Cement sales, a proxy for construction activity, increased for eight months straight after Hurricane Maria to 33% above prestorm levels.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s building industry is booming, fueled by federal disaster-relief dollars and insurance proceeds together projected to total $82 billion over time. The influx has turned construction into a bright spot for an island economy racked by population loss, a declining manufacturing base and the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\nSince the hurricane, federal agencies have obligated $4.8 billion for recovery work in Puerto Rico through last August, according to the Center for a New Economy, a San Juan-based think tank. While financial planners don\u2019t know the exact scale of federal assistance over the next decade, the U.S. government has made some firm commitments already, including an $18.5 billion grant for rebuilding housing and other infrastructure.\n\nMeantime, the construction industry is reckoning with rising costs. Not only have wages increased, but material costs have risen since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union and on Chinese products like home appliances, electrical equipment and other materials critical to Puerto Rico\u2019s rebuilding efforts.\n\nPuerto Rico relies heavily on Chinese imports, and 72% of those products are subject to new or additional tariffs implemented this year, according to KPMG LLP, a trade and customs consultancy.\n\nCostlier labor and supplies are upending financial projections and potentially shrinking the number and size of feasible projects, said Stephen Spears, president of the Associated General Contractors of America\u2019s Puerto Rico chapter.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 argued that raising construction workers\u2019 wages would coax laborers into the building industry at a time when it badly needed them. Photo: Carlos Giusti/Associated Press\n\n\u201cIf you have a $100 million project, you now have a $135 million project,\u201d Mr. Spears said. \u201cAll of a sudden, those dollars that were estimated and delegated to us for the reconstruction of the island are going to have much less impact.\u201d\n\nGov. Rossell\u00f3, through an executive order in late July, raised the minimum hourly wage on government-funded construction to $15 an hour from $8.25. He argued the move would coax laborers into the building industry and persuade workers to stay in Puerto Rico rather than migrate to the mainland U.S.\n\nIn August Puerto Rico\u2019s oversight board said the new minimum wage could \u201cleak into the broader economy\u201d and apply to work that isn\u2019t covered by federal taxpayers, \u201cmaking it more costly to undertake the vast amount of private reconstruction required on the island and likely reducing employment of construction workers for private projects.\u201d\n\nContractors and developers say the new wage level also risks slowing the completion of vital repairs. The governor\u2019s order will raise overall construction costs by between 8% and 20.5% and contribute between 0.5% and 1.2% to overall inflation, according to San-Juan based economic consultancy Estudios T\u00e9nicos. Puerto Rico\u2019s oversight board expects inflation to stay below 1.6% through the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nHigher costs mean fewer projects completed each year and a \u201csmaller and weaker private construction sector when the federal funds eventually run out,\u201d according to an Estudios T\u00e9nicos study commissioned by Puerto Rico business groups and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. One government project to improve roads in western Puerto Rico will cost 24.75% more because of the new wage mandate, Estudios T\u00e9nicos found.\n\nWhile Puerto Rico\u2019s $15 hourly floor applies only to public construction, both supporters and critics say the effects could extend to the private sector, forcing small businesses\u2019 to raise wages to retain workers and potentially compelling some to consolidate.\n\nYet raising the minimum wage enjoys significant popular support in a territory where construction laborers earned a median hourly wage of $8.69 last year compared with $13.79 in Florida, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEdison Severino, an organizer for the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, or Liuna, said a higher minimum wage was necessary to encourage people who work in the large underground economy or have given up looking for employment to rejoin the formal labor force.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s labor participation rate hovers around 40%, lower than the Dominican Republic\u2019s and the overall U.S. rate of 63%.\n\n\u201cYou need to motivate people to work,\u201d Mr. Severino said. \u201cYou\u2019re not incentivizing people to get up and work if what they make is so minimal.\u201d\n\nWrite to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Julie Wernau at Julie.Wernau@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nKPMG LLP is a trade and customs consultancy.

Immigration, an issue President Trump has pushed in the last leg of the midterm elections, came in at No. 2, with 23%. The economy and jobs rounded out the early results at the No. 3 spot.\n\nIn many areas, voters had to wait more than an hour to cast their ballots. In Apex, N.C., a suburb southwest of Raleigh, voters said the numbers were unusually high, even though there was no high-level race such as governor or U.S. Senate to drive turnout.\n\nKaty Haile, a 39 year-old Web developer, said the line had never been out the door before.

Local media reports said hundreds of people were waiting in line at some sites. Mr. Sorenson said emergency paper ballots were available if voters wanted to use them. Some voters opted to wait, and others left and said they would come back later, he said.\n\nDemocratic lawyers in Washington were closely monitoring Georgia\u2019s election-system problems. The state is drawing particular attention given the backdrop of a high-profile race for governor in which voting issues have been an issue and the Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp is on the ballot.\n\nMr. Kemp on Sunday asked for an investigation into possible tampering with the state\u2019s election system. Democrats dismissed it as a stunt and distraction from security flaws. Mr. Kemp\u2019s opponent, Stacey Abrams, who is seeking to become the first female African-American governor in the U.S., has leveled charges of voter suppression.\n\nThe Republican National Committee didn\u2019t report election issues Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn New York City, broken scanners added to delays in some places. At one Brooklyn site, all four scanners went down for two hours on Tuesday morning.\n\nSusannah Meadows, 45 years old, said she waited an hour and 45 minutes to vote. Her husband waited in line and left before voting. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait two hours to vote,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, a large swath of the South and East had to contended with bad weather. Steady rain fell Tuesday across Virginia and Pennsylvania, home to several key congressional battles, as well as New York, and was expected to intensify, possibly affecting turnout.\n\nMany voters said Tuesday that their views of Mr. Trump drove their decisions at the polls. In Missouri\u2019s St. Charles County, outside St. Louis, retiree Bill Craig and his wife, Marilyn, said they cast ballots specifically to add to the momentum behind Mr. Trump and the Republican party.\n\nAs the 2018 midterms heat up, both Democratic and Republican candidates are positioning themselves as outsiders who will change the status quo. But what does it mean to be a political outsider?

Ms. Labby, who is 72 and retired from a vocational tech school, cited health care and immigration policies.\n\nHer voting Tuesday, she said, was \u201ctotal Democrat, total anti-Trump.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has been his party\u2019s highest-profile campaigner even though he is not on the ballot, hosting a string of boisterous rallies.\n\nAt the White House on Tuesday, aides nervously awaited the election results while President Trump kept out of public view.

Mr. Trump has made several trips to the Sunshine State hoping to bolster Republicans and taking particular aim at gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, who got a visit from former President Obama last week.\n\nFrom the moment polls opened at 7 a.m., a steady stream of voters arrived at the Aquilina C. Howell Center in Tallahassee. They were a diverse demographic mix\u2014black and white, young and old.\n\nHarold Ford, a 76-year-old African-American retired counselor, said he voted for Mr. Gillum. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to say he\u2019s liberal,\u201d said Mr. Ford, a registered Democrat. But \u201che\u2019s not penned in by his politics. He will reach across the aisle to get things done.\u201d\n\nOther voters in Florida had mixed feelings. Neil McAdorey, 54, is a lacrosse coach at Parkland High School in Florida, where a gunman opened fire on students in February, killing 17 people. Mr. McAdorey said he traditionally leans Republican, and voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. He declined to say whom he favored this year but lamented the country\u2019s increased political polarization.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring back what was great about America, which was that we were united,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been strongly united in the last year and a half and really even before that.\u201d\n\nAnd despite low unemployment and an uptick in growth, Mr. McAdorey said the economy also weighs heavily into his thinking. \u201cI have two sons who are entering the workforce and I am very concerned about the opportunities available for them and concerned about jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Ohio, another battleground state Mr. Trump visited Monday in his final campaign swing, there is a heated governor\u2019s race after 2016 GOP presidential candidate John Kasich is leaving due to term limits. Republican Mike DeWine faces Democrat Richard Cordray in the race to follow Mr. Kasich.\n\nBrian McBurney, 61, said he traditionally votes Democratic in his hometown of Massillon, Ohio, but has grown more conservative with age\u2014motivated by issues including tax cuts, health care and immigration. He said he plans to vote Tuesday for Mr. DeWine and Republican incumbent Rep. Bob Gibbs in Ohio\u2019s Seventh Congressional District.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re better off\u201d with Mr. Trump as president,\u201d Mr. McBurney said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything he does, but I think we\u2019re better off with him than we would have been with (Hillary) Clinton.\u201d\n\nOther contests to watch include races in Indiana and Kentucky, the states where the first returns are expected at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nAmerica Speaks: Why Voters Went to the Polls The Wall Street Journal asked voters around the country one question: \u201cWhy did you come out to vote today?\u201d Here is what they said.

Here\u2019s your guide to watching the results roll in on Election Day, based on East Coast times.\n\nThe first polls begin closing at 6 p.m. Eastern in Kentucky and Indiana.\n\nKentucky and Indiana: Indiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern. But the key race to watch is in Kentucky: the state\u2019s sixth congressional district in Lexington. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Andy Barr, who represents an area where the GOP typically does well, but he is facing a well-financed opponent in retired Marine pilot Amy McGrath, a Democrat.\n\n7 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in four key states: Virginia, Georgia, Florida and also Indiana, where a last batch of polls close in a state that is in two time zones. Polls also close in South Carolina.\n\nFlorida: Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, has attracted a grassroots following of young people and minorities. The party hopes Mr. Gillum\u2019s campaign for governor against the GOP\u2019s Ron DeSantis can bring more Democrats to the polls, all the while lifting the fortunes of incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who is being challenged for his Senate seat by outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nOn the House side, the four most competitive races to watch are all prime pick opportunities for the Democrats: FL-26 and FL-27, two GOP-held districts that encompass part of the Miami-Dade region; FL-15 outside Tampa; and FL-16 in Sarasota County.\n\nIndiana: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, one of the party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents, is being challenged by businessman Mike Braun. Republicans are looking to capture this seat to expand their 51-49 Senate majority or to create a buffer to offset loses elsewhere.\n\nGeorgia: The governor\u2019s race between progressive former state lawmaker Stacey Abrams and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, is one of the most watched in the country. She could make history by becoming the first black female governor in the U.S.\n\nThe WSJ's Gerald F. Seib talks about the numbers that are important to determine control of the House and Senate. Photo: Getty\n\nThere are also two key House races to watch: Georgia\u2019s sixth congressional district, home of a special election last year that launched this year\u2019s fierce fight for control of the chamber, where Rep. Karen Handel is facing Democrat Lucy McBath. The race illustrates how both parties this year have battled over suburban, educated women. The other is Georgia\u2019s seventh congressional district, where GOP Rep. Rob Woodall faces a tight race with Democratic challenger Carolyn Bourdeaux.\n\nVirginia: There are several opportunities for House Democrats to pick up seats. Rep. Barbara Comstock, an incumbent in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, is considered among the most vulnerable Republicans as she squares off against Democrat Jennifer Wexton.\n\nA more significant bellwether could be in Virginia\u2019s second congressional district, where GOP Rep. Scott Taylor faces a stiff challenge from Democratic businesswoman Elaine Luria. And Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who ousted Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary, is now in danger of losing his seat to Democrat Abigail Spanberger.\n\n7:30 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in three states: North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nOhio: The governor\u2019s race in Ohio is nationally watched because 2016 GOP presidential candidate John Kasich is leaving the governor\u2019s mansion due to term limits. Republican Mike DeWine faces Democrat Richard Cordray in the race to follow Mr. Kasich.\n\nA rematch in Ohio\u2019s 12th congressional district in suburban Columbus could also be telling. Rep. Troy Balderson won a special election there this year\u2014but just barely beating Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor\u2014signaling the GOP\u2019s weakening grip in suburbia.\n\nWest Virginia: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s state voted for President Trump in 2016 by 42 percentage points. Yet, Mr. Manchin is leading attorney general Patrick Morrisey in public polling, and a victory would demonstrate that a candidate\u2019s personal brand can outweigh party affiliation.\n\nWhat to Watch: 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nAt 8 p.m. Eastern, the largest set of states will close, including eight states with competitive Senate races. Statewide competitive races 8 p.m.: Senate S TN MI PA MO MS TX ND IL CT NJ G Governor KS OK MD RI SD Other states closing: DE AL MA ME AR Competitive House races closing Democrat-held Republican-held Tossup Likely Democrat Lean Republican Likely Republican Lean Democrat\n\n8 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nKansas: The governor\u2019s race is a tossup between Republican Kris Kobach and Democrat Laura Kelly, and there are two potential House upsets. GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder\u2019s seat in the third House district is at risk of falling into the Democratic column, as the race now leans in favor of challenger Sharice Davids. There is also a tossup race for an open seat in the state\u2019s second congressional district, where Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a Republican, is retiring.\n\nMichigan: GOP Rep. Mike Bishop, whose eighth district includes a swath of the Detroit suburbs, faces a tough challenger in Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA case officer, creating a key pick-up opportunity for Democrats.\n\nMississippi: There are two Senate races in the state, but one of them is unlikely to be decided Tuesday night. That\u2019s because GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith isn\u2019t the only Republican vying for the seat: Republican Chris McDaniel is running against her, as is Democrat Mike Espy, creating a three-way race. The top two vote-getters advance to a Nov. 27 runoff if none of them can claim an outright majority of the vote on Election Day, under Mississippi election rules.\n\nMissouri: Sen. Claire McCaskill is another endangered Democrat in the Senate. She faces state Attorney General Josh Hawley. President Trump made two trips to the state in the final days to try to knock off Ms. McCaskill.\n\nNew Jersey: Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, plagued by questions over his ethics despite escaping conviction in a corruption trial last year, is unpopular in a state that leans Democratic. He faces GOP businessman Bob Hugin. If Republicans can defeat Mr. Menendez, it would bode well for their ability to maintain control of the Senate.\n\nVoters across the country will head to the polls Tuesday to cast their votes in the general election. The WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains five areas that are worth watching as results come in. Photo: Getty\n\nPennsylvania: There are four competitive U.S. House races in Pennsylvania, all of them pick-up opportunities for the Democrats, and they are looking here to make a strong down payment on their path toward a majority. Republicans have called this \u201cground zero\u201d in the battle for House control. Several districts moved further out of reach for Republicans due to court-issued redistricting in the state.\n\nTennessee: The open Senate seat in Tennessee\u2014Republican Sen. Bob Corker is retiring\u2014is critical to Democrats if they have any hope of gaining ground in the chamber. Former Gov. Phil Bredesen, who was endorsed by singer Taylor Swift, is challenging Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who benefited from a Trump endorsement.\n\nTexas: Can Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke topple GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in a deep-red state? It would be one of the biggest political upsets in the history of the Senate, and a signal that the Lone Star state could be in play during the 2020 presidential race.\n\nAlso in Texas, Democrats are targeting Republican Reps. Pete Sessions in a district outside Dallas and John Culberson of Houston, both in tossup races. A defeat of Rep. Will Hurd, who is facing Democrat Gina Ortiz-Jones, would signal a difficult night for Republicans.\n\nWhat to Watch: 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.\n\nAt 9 p.m., polls start closing in Minnesota, which includes the only toss up and lean Republican seats held by Democrats.

Kyrsten Sinema to gain a seat for her party, but her fight against Rep. Martha McSally has been extremely tight. The seat is open because Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican, is retiring.\n\nMinnesota: Four races in Minnesota are a bellwether for control of the House. Both parties agree that if Democrats win in three of these four districts, it would be a bad sign for the GOP elsewhere in the country. The four races are:\n\nMN-01: Democrats currently hold this seat in rural Minnesota. If they can hang on, it may mean they are faring better in rural areas than they often get credit for. Democrat Dan Feehan faces Republican Jim Hagedorn in that open-seat race.\n\nMN-02: GOP Rep. Jason Lewis faces a stiff challenge from Democrat Angie Craig in outskirts of the Twin Cities.\n\nMN-03: Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen faces Democrat Dean Phillips, presenting another test for the GOP in the suburbs.\n\nMN-08: This is a seat the GOP is supposed to flip and create a small buffer against any other losses. Republican Pete Stauber is matched up with Democrat Joe Radinovich.\n\nWhat to Watch: 10 p.m. and Later\n\nThe last 10 states start closing polls at 10 p.m. Eastern.

Democratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota are hoping to win in states President Trump took in 2016. Mr. Tester\u2019s race is a tossup against Republican Matt Rosendale; Ms. Heitkamp\u2019s race is leaning in favor of her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer.\n\nIn Nevada, Republican Sen. Dean Heller, the chamber\u2019s most vulnerable GOP incumbent, battles Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen.\n\n11 p.m. Eastern\n\nPolls start to close in California, Oregon and Washington state.

Republican Knute Buehler is campaigning for voters unhappy with Democratic Gov. Kate Brown\u2014and President Trump. Mr. Buehler said he wrote in Ohio\u2019s moderate Republican Gov. Kasich in the 2016 presidential election rather than back Mr. Trump.\n\nWashington: The state\u2019s southwestern corner has seen an influx of nearly $2 million in new spending from both parties, indicating that the seat held for four terms by GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler is in jeopardy. Her opponent is Democrat Carolyn Long.\n\n12 a.m. Eastern\n\nPolls close in Alaska.\n\nAlaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, suspended his re-election bid less than three weeks before the election. The move came three days after the sudden resignation of Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott over what Mr. Walker described as an inappropriate overture toward a woman. The three-way governor\u2019s race is leaning in favor of Republican candidate Mike Dunleavy over Democrat Mark Begich but after such a recent scandal, the outcome is hard to call.\n\nAmplification:\n\nIndiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern.

They include marquee names such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. and smaller firms such as tire-maker Amerityre Corp.\n\nThe SEC questioned nearly one-third of early adopters over their compliance with the revenue recognition standard. Seventy percent of the letters included questions about how companies arrived at their decisions for performance obligations measurements.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson is that as long as you can justify your reasoning for whatever performance obligation measurement you came up with, I think the SEC will initially allow them some leeway or provide guidance,\u201d said Rob Peters, senior director of customer experience and knowledge at Intelligize.\n\nThe regulator engaged in protracted conversations with three companies\u2014Alphabet, General Dynamics Corp. and Commvault Systems Inc.\u2014as the agency sought to clarify the judgements and analysis the companies used to reach their decisions.\n\n\u201cThe questions they asked were focused on many of the areas we spent the most time assessing as part of our adoption,\u201d Jay Whalen, corporate controller at Commvault, said in an email. \u201cIn the end, we made some minor modifications to disclosures that were beneficial for the users of our financial statements.\u201d\n\nAn Alphabet spokeswoman declined to comment. Representatives of General Dynamics did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cJust because there\u2019s a lot of comments doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s something wrong,\u201d said Chris Bolash, a partner in the financial accounting advisory services practice at Ernst & Young LLP. \u201cIt just means the staff may require additional disclosures to clarify how a company made those judgements.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolash said he has used these comment-letter exchanges to help inform his clients about how tackle applying the standard to certain fact patterns or tricky areas of the rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very instructive to other companies to see that process and the resulting documentation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be a guide for them.\u201d\n\nSeveral SEC officials last year said that the regulator would give companies some time to adopt the new revenue standard before deploying comment letters to review compliance.
