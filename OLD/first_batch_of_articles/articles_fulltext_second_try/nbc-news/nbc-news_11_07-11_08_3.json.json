If that holds it would be the highest rate since 1966, when 48.7 percent of voters participated.\n\nThe numbers are still subject to change as states continue to report final vote counts, especially places like California, where voters can mail in their choices all the way up to Election Day and large numbers of ballots have yet to be counted.\n\nThe high turnout, which was presaged by a surge in early votes, as well as primary and special election votes, comes after voters participated at historically low rates just four years ago in the 2014 midterms. Just 36.7 percent of voters cast ballots that year, the lowest percentage since World War II.\n\nMcDonald attributed the increase to a variety of factors, including more high-profile and competitive Senate and governor races in key states. The House, which flipped to Democrats, was also much more hotly contested this year in comparison to 2014, when Republicans were considered prohibitive favorites to maintain control.\n\nTexas, which had the lowest turnout in 2014 amid mostly non-competitive state races, saw its turnout rate spike as voters went to polls in the closely watched Senate race between Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O\u2019Rourke. But the effect also extended to states like North Carolina, which saw high turnout despite an off-year for both senate and gubernatorial elections.\n\nBut the biggest factor seems to be President Donald Trump. Unlike previous midterms, where one party's voters showed up in high numbers and the other remained depressed, the high turnout rates suggest voters across the board were eager to participate. Exit polls found two-thirds of voters identified Trump as important to their vote, either to show their support or register their opposition.\n\n\"Let's give Trump some credit: He inflames passions for both Democrats and Republicans,\" McDonald said.", "By Variety\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Diego Luna will star in a new \"Star Wars\" series for Disney's upcoming streaming service. The show will be a prequel to \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\"\n\nLuna will reprise his role as rebel spy Cassian Andor, the cocky daredevil who helped Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso steal the Death Star plans in the hit 2016 movie. Given that film's high mortality rate, a sequel would have been a difficult proposition.\n\n\"Going back to the 'Star Wars' universe is very special for me,\" Luna said in a statement. \"I have so many memories of the great work we did together and the relationships I made throughout the journey. We have a fantastic adventure ahead of us, and this new exciting format will give us the chance to explore this character more deeply.\"\n\nThe show is one of several ambitious series coming to Disney's Netflix challenger, which it has christened Disney+. As Variety first reported, Disney is developing a number of limited series centered on popular characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (or the MCU, as it's commonly known). These shows may have actors such as Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen reprising their big screen roles as Loki and the Scarlet Witch in programming that debuts on the streaming service. The company has also tapped Jon Favreau to write and executive produce another \"Star Wars\" TV series titled \"The Mandalorian,\" which centers on a \"lone gunfighter\" and his adventures in the far reaches of the galaxy.\n\nThe \"Rogue One\" prequel will unfold in the early years of the Rebellion and is described as a \"rousing spy thriller.\" A release date for the series has not yet been announced, but production will begin in 2019. Disney expects to launch its new direct-to-consumer service late next year. The company believes that customers are moving more deeply into the world of subscription streaming and it needs to be there to vacuum up their dollars. Even though companies such as Amazon and Netflix have a head start, Disney hopes that its suite of brands, which include not just Lucasfilm, but also Pixar and Marvel, will give it an advantage.\n\n\"In this era of unprecedented consumer choice, brands matter more than ever,\" Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger said on an earnings call with investors as the \"Star Wars\" news broke on Thursday.\n\n\"We always believed we had the brands and content to be extremely competitive and to thrive alongside Netflix, Amazon, and anyone else in the market,\" he added.\n\nLuna's credits include the very un-Disney erotic drama \"Y Tu Mama Tambien,\" as well as \"Milk\" and \"Flatliners.\" He will next appear in \"If Beale Street Could Talk\" and also stars in Woody Allen's \"A Rainy Day in New York,\" which Amazon would probably be happy to sell to Disney's new streaming service...or any company that would have it.\n\nLuna will start shooting the \"Rogue One\" spinoff after he completes work on the next season of Netflix's \"Narcos.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

We hope that the courts will step in to remedy this injustice,\" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project.\n\nSenior administration officials told reporters on a conference call Thursday that the president has the legal authority to do so because of sections of immigration law that allow the president discretion over who is admitted into the United States \u2014 the same language the administration used to support its travel ban in court.\n\nThe officials said the goal is to force more immigrants who wish to claim asylum to do so at designated ports of entry. Recently, many asylum-seekers have chosen to cross illegally because they are kept waiting for days in Mexico due to backlogs at ports of entry.\n\nThe new restrictions will apply for 90 days, but could end earlier, officials said.\n\nUnder international law, however, asylum-seekers are permitted to make a claim regardless of where they enter.\n\nThe administration was expecting lawsuits to be filed, which could keep the new policy from going into effect, but officials told NBC News that they expect the Supreme Court will eventually uphold their right to block asylum seekers with Justice Brett Kavanaugh now on the bench.\n\nImmigrants crossing between ports of entry will still be allowed to claim asylum, but will have to prove that they meet a higher bar than a \"credible fear\" of returning to their home country, the current preliminary test. Under the new rule, the officials said, asylum-seekers will only be permitted to remain at large in the U.S. as they await a court hearing if they can prove \"reasonable fear\" or that they are protected under the U.N.'s Convention against Torture.\n\nThe full text of the new regulation can be found here.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

At least according to Sir Martin Rees, one of Britain's most esteemed astronomers.\n\nIn his new book, \"On the Future,\" Rees turns his focus closer to home, examining the existential threats that face humanity over the next century. From cyberattacks to advances in biotechnology to artificial intelligence to climate change, Rees, Britain's astronomer royal, says we are living at a critical juncture \u2014 one that could define how the human species fares.\n\nTo learn more about which technologies worry him most, his prospects for humanity's survival and why he thinks we'll eventually enter a period of \"post-human evolution,\" MACH recently sat down with Rees in New York City. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nMACH: Why did you write this book now?\n\nRees: Over the last few years, I've had an opportunity to interact with different technologies and more science policy people. I was concerned that they weren't worrying enough about some potential threats and some potential opportunities. I thought it was good to try and tie together my various thoughts, which I'd expressed in lectures and articles, in a book which I hope is fairly small and readable.\n\nIn your 2003 book, \u201cOur Final Hour,\u201d you gave humanity about a 50-50 chance of surviving the 21st century. Where do you think we stand today?\n\nWell, we survived 18 years so far, but I do think we will have a bumpy ride through the century. I think it's unlikely we'll wipe ourselves out, but I do feel that there are all kinds of threats which we are in denial about and aren't doing enough about. I'm thinking about climate change and the associated loss of biodiversity. We are not urgently dealing with that. Also, we need to contend with the fact that the world population is getting larger. It will be at least 9 billion by midcentury. It is going to be a big stress on resources as well as on food production.\n\nApart from those two predictable trends \u2014 a warming world and a more crowded world \u2014 there are also other concerns. We have new technologies, which are wonderful and powerful, but which involve risks as well. I'm thinking of biotechnology, cybertechnology and artificial intelligence. Biotechnology is wonderful. It's allowed us to grow more food. It's improved health. It's allowed us to eliminate some diseases, but it also has a downside. It allows us to modify viruses like the influenza virus to make it more virulent and more transmissible. It allows us to change human beings and animals in ways that might be ethically unacceptable. All these new technologies are developing so fast that we are not sure that we can really cope with them well.\n\nIt's important to get a wider audience to take these seriously. Although these are scientific questions, the way science is applied is really a matter for all the public. Scientists shouldn't be the only people to decide how science is used.\n\nWhat technologies worry you most right now?\n\nI think at the moment the main worries are cybertechnology and biotechnology. The problem of both cyberthreats and misuse of biotechnology is that this can be done by just a few people. It doesn't need huge specialist facilities, like making an atomic bomb.\n\nThere was a report by the United States Defense Department in 2012 which said that a cyberattack on the electricity grid on the East Coast of the U.S. was so serious that it might, I quote, \"demand a nuclear response.\" That's the level of threat that we are under from cyberattacks.\n\nThese two kinds of technologies enable just a few people to have a hugely wide-ranging and maybe even global cascading effect. This leads to big problems of governance because you'd like to regulate the use of these things, but enforcing regulations worldwide is very, very difficult. Think how hopeless it is to enforce the drug laws globally or the tax laws globally. To actually ensure that no one misuses these new technologies is just as difficult. I worry that we are going to have to minimize this risk by actions which lead to a great tension between privacy, liberty and security.\n\nDo you see ways that we can use and develop these technologies in a responsible way?\n\nWe've got to try. We can't put the genie back in the bottle. We've just got to make sure that we can derive benefits and minimize risks. When I say we have a bumpy ride, I think it is hard to imagine that there won't be occasions when there are quite serious disruptions caused by either error or by design using these new powerful technologies.\n\nYou identified climate change as one of your big worries. What do you make of the idea that we should colonize another planet as an insurance policy against global warming?\n\nThere is the idea that we should despair and evacuate this planet and go somewhere else. That's a dangerous delusion. I know it's been promoted by Elon Musk and also by my late colleague Stephen Hawking, but I think there's no Planet B. The world's problems can't be solved by escaping from the world. They've got to be tackled here.\n\nAlthough a few pioneers are going to live on Mars [in the future], I think we are going to have to ensure that the bulk of humanity is able to live safely and comfortably here on this planet. It's a dangerous delusion to think otherwise, because terraforming Mars is much, much harder than ensuring we have a sustainable situation here and avoid massive climate change.\n\nBut you think we\u2019ll eventually have humans living on Mars?\n\nI think there is a likelihood that by the end of the century there will be a community of people living on Mars. I think they will be people who are thrill-seeking adventurers rather than normal people. I think they will go there, not through a NASA program, but through one of these private space endeavors, like Elon Musk's SpaceX or Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. I don't think they'll be followed by large numbers.\n\nThese people on Mars \u2014 I think they will be important for the far future of the 22nd century and beyond, because they will be in an environment to which they're ill adapted. They will have every incentive to use bio-modification and maybe cyborg techniques \u2014 linking to electronic machines \u2014 to adapt to their alien environment. They will quite quickly become like a new species.\n\nYou talk about this prospect of \u201cpost-human evolution\u201d in your book. What does that mean?\n\nIt's a fundamentally new development in that it's a kind of evolution [that] is not the Darwinian natural selection, which over three-and-a-half billion years have led simple life to us human beings. It will be a version of secular intelligent design [where] we design entities which may have greater capacity than humans. This could happen in a few centuries rather than a few thousand centuries, which Darwinian selection requires in order to produce a new species. The key question is to what extent it will be flesh-and-blood, organic intelligence and to what extent it will be electronic.\n\nIf that happens, would we still be considered human?\n\nThis, of course, raises all kinds of philosophical questions. People imagine that we can download human brains one day into electronic machines. The question is: Is that really still you? If you were told your brain had been downloaded, would you be happy to be destroyed? What would happen if, for instance, many copies were made of you? Which would be your personal identity?\n\nAlso, the question of consciousness. We know that what\u2019s special about us is not only that we can do all kinds of things that demand intelligence, but we are self aware. We have feelings and emotions. It's a big uncertainty whether an electronic intelligence, which manifests the same capabilities as us, will necessarily have self-awareness. It could be that self-awareness emerges in any entity that's especially complex and is plugged into the external world. It could be [that] it's something which is peculiar to hardware made of flesh and blood, like we are, and would not be replicated by electronic machines.\n\nWhat\u2019s your overall message for humanity?\n\nThis century is crucial because if you're very pessimistic, you can imagine that we will misuse powerful technology and snuff ourselves out or foreclose a bright, longer-term future. On the other hand, if we use technology wisely, then it allows us to perhaps jump-start an even more exciting kind of civilization here on Earth and far beyond. That's why even though the Earth has existed for 45 million centuries, and will go on existing for many million more centuries, this century is special because it's the one which is seeing the transition from natural evolution to maybe artificial evolution \u2014 whether biological or cyborg \u2014 and also the era when, for the first time, we can escape from this planet and perhaps start exploring others.\n\nWant more stories about technology?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Among those in the video is Chris Harrison, host of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d series, who moved to the area after growing up in Texas.\n\n\u201cThis is a little piece of heaven,\u201d he said of Thousand Oaks.\n\nAt the Borderline Bar and Grill, Wednesday is the weekly \u201ccollege country night\u201d for students; while there is just one small university, California Lutheran University, in Thousand Oaks itself, there are more than a dozen within a 30-mile radius of the city center, including Moorpark College 8 miles away, Pepperdine University 14 miles away and California State University Northridge 20 miles away.\n\nCalifornia Lutheran students described the Borderline as a favorite haunt, where they could kick back midweek or on weekends.\n\nOn Wednesdays, patrons listen to country music and take line-dancing lessons from a DJ, they said.

Ron Helus of the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office pulled up at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, where a former Marine had burst in and began shooting patrons.\n\nHelus, a 29-year veteran on the overnight shift, met up with a pair of California Highway Patrol officers who had raced to the scene from a traffic stop, authorities said. They could hear gunshots. There was no time to wait for backup.\n\nHelus and one of the officers went in the front door \u2014 exactly what American police officers are trained to do when they encounter \u201cactive shooters.\u201d\n\nThe strategy, the result of changes in police tactics made after the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, puts the first officers to arrive at the scene in enormous peril. The fewer the officers, the less protection they have.\n\nStudents are escorted out of Columbine High School by police after a shooting on April 20, 1999.

Shot several times in a firefight with the gunman, Helus was pulled from the bar by the highway patrol officer he had gone in with and died hours later at a hospital, authorities said. Eleven others were killed inside the bar before the shooter killed himself, the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\n\n\u201cWhat you saw last night with the sergeant and California Highway Patrol officer, that is an expectation we have, that they are going to make entry and do their best to stop the threat and prevent further loss of life,\u201d said Travis Walker, the chief of police in Cathedral City, California, and a former member of the San Bernardino Police Department, where he led the tactical response to a 2015 terror attack at a government office. \u201cIn the time the suspect engaged with the officers, he wasn\u2019t engaged in killing innocent victims.\u201d\n\nThat approach was also taken at last month\u2019s shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead and seven wounded, including two city police officers and two SWAT team members.\n\n\u201cIn almost every active shooter situation in recent times where police get there while the shooting is still going on, police go in at high risk to themselves, following a national training model, which is immediate intervention,\u201d said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research and training organization.\n\nThe new model is the result of lessons police have learned since Columbine, when two students killed 13 people and themselves while police took 45 minutes to surround the school and prepare a tactical unit to enter.\n\nSince then, with many more mass shootings to study, police have emphasized faster response by arriving officers and less reliance on specialized teams. Research showed them that active shootings typically last four to six minutes. So they started training patrol officers \u2014 typically the first to arrive at an active shooting \u2014 in more tactical maneuvers. Those officers are now often equipped with military-style body armor, helmets, rifles and trauma-care kits, including tourniquets.\n\nEarly on in the change in tactics, officers were advised to wait until there were four or five of them at the scene before entering together.\n\n\u201cThen we started to realize that waiting for four or five people could mean waiting several minutes, so we started authorizing smaller teams to enter,\u201d said Peter Blair, executive director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University. \u201cFrom four to three to two, and now we are in an era where departments authorize a single officer to make entry.\u201d\n\nAn FBI agent outside of the Tree of Life Synagogue, where 11 people were killed by a gunman in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27, 2018.

But there are also other considerations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the amount of damage a person can cause within a few seconds, much less a few minutes,\u201d Blair said. \u201cSo the judgment by an officer is: \u2018Can I intervene now? Is my backup behind me or a few minutes out? Should I wait a few seconds?'\u201d\n\nAn FBI study of 160 active shooter incidents from 2000 to 2013 found that law enforcement officers in 45 of the incidents \"engaged\" the attacker. Nine officers in those incidents were killed and 28 were wounded.\n\nThe difficult decisions facing the first officer at the scene fueled controversy after the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Didi Martinez\n\nA Houston district court judge who lost a re-election bid on Tuesday is facing criticism for releasing a majority of the juvenile defendants who appeared before him Wednesday after allegedly asking them whether they planned to kill anyone.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Glenn Devlin, a Republican, lost his seat Tuesday to Democratic opponent Natalia Oakes \u2014 in a wave of 59 conservative jurists who had been ousted by Harris County voters, NBC Houston affiliate KPRC reported.\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, Devlin had made a decision that shocked Steve Halpert, juvenile division chief for Harris County's Public Defender's Office.\n\n\"The juveniles were asked whether they were going to, if released, whether they would kill somebody,\" Halpert told KPRC. \"It was a little bit shocking because that's not a question Judge Devlin would ever ask. Or any judge.\"\n\nThe judge\u2019s actions were especially incongruous given his track record of incarcerating juvenile defendants, according to local media. A Houston Chronicle investigation in October revealed that Devlin and Judge John Phillips accounted for more than one-fifth of all children sent to Texas juvenile prisons last year, sending them \u201cyounger and for less-serious offenses than the county\u2019s third juvenile court.\"\n\nJudge Glenn Devlin is facing criticism for releasing nearly all defendants who appeared before him after asking if they planned to kill anyone in Harris County District Court in Houston. via glenndevlin.com\n\nAnd even the people who are tasked with helping young men and women fight their charges were alarmed.\n\n\"I am baffled by why he did it,\" Harris County Chief Public Defender Alex Bunin told NBC News on Thursday. \"It's definitely not good for the kids in that they are being released without any conditions.\"\n\nBunin said he was worried about the kids released Wednesday, claiming that some of them had no parents or guardians to take them home at the time of their release and that others need support services like mental health treatment.\n\nThe public defender also said he is sympathetic to the district attorney's concerns saying the judge\u2019s move could \u201cendanger the public,\" according to a statement by Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg.\n\n\"Neither side is happy,\" Bunin said. \"This is different in that it\u2019s across the board. It's just never been done without any consideration of the effect of the release of the child and the community.\"\n\nBut Harris County Juvenile Courts Manager Cindy Milom contested any portrayals of a \"mass release\" of defendants. She said only seven of 13 juvenile defendants who faced the judge Wednesday were released.\n\nMilom, who said the judge was on vacation and couldn't comment on decisions he made, is also pushing back on Bunin's claims expressing concern for the conditions under which the children were released.\n\n\"I really find that hard to believe because the public defender did not represent all the juveniles,\" Milom said.\n\nProsecutors told The Houston Chronicle that four of the kids released were facing aggravated robbery charges. Oakes will be revisiting the cases during a reset scheduled for Jan. 4, the Houston paper reports.\n\nThe ACLU condemned the judge\u2019s actions Wednesday calling it \"improper\" and saying it was \"motivated by partisan interests\" or the \"result of his political loss.\" The organization has since called on the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct to launch an investigation.\n\n\"Judge Devlin\u2019s mass release of children today, without any apparent concern for the children's safety or for ensuring that they are released to their parents, proves his detachment from the needs of each child,\u201d the ACLU said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI mean, the day after the election when he wasn't re-elected, he changed his policy,\u201d Bunin said. \u201cThere doesn't seem to be any intellectual reasoning for it rather than to make a statement.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 State Commission on Judicial Conduct told NBC News Thursday that they cannot \u201cconfirm or deny\u201d the existence of a complaint against the judge due to confidentiality rules in the state, according to Eric Vinson, executive director of the commission.\n\nThough Vinson declined to comment on specific facts involving the incident, the director did clarify that even an outgoing judge could be subject to an investigation.\n\n\u201cA judge is subject to the discipline of the commission,\u201d said Vinson, noting that the commission has the power to look at a former judge\u2019s actions while they were on the bench.\n\nOakes responded to a request for comment on Thursday evening saying, \"I am out of town but from what I've heard I would not expect that from a professional.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Women in this study had up to a 76 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease, while for men the risk was 85 percent higher, compared with peers with normal blood pressure.\n\n\"Elevated blood pressure in early adulthood can result in heart attacks by several mechanisms, and these levels of blood pressure may progress to higher levels over time,\" said Ramachandran Vasan of the Boston University School of Medicine and School of Public Health.\n\nHigh blood pressure is often associated with other risk factors, such as excess weight, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and smoking, that raise the risk of stroke and heart attack, Vasan, author of an accompanying editorial, said by email. These can damage target organs, including heart and arteries, and promote thickening of the arterial walls and the buildup of cholesterol deposits and plaques in arteries, \"thereby creating a substrate (\"soil,\" if you will) for future heart attacks and strokes.\"\n\nFor the studies, both published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers assessed high blood pressure using new, more aggressive target levels recommended by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology in 2017. The new recommendations were based on emerging evidence suggesting that even slightly elevated blood pressure early in life might be a precursor to cardiovascular disease as people age.\n\nPatients were classified as having hypertension when the top number of their reading, or systolic pressure (reflecting the pressure against artery walls when the heart beats), averaged at least 130 millimeters of mercury.\n\nThey were also considered to have hypertension if the bottom number, or diastolic pressure (reflecting pressure against artery walls when the heart rests between beats), averaged at least 80 millimeters of mercury.\n\nBefore the new recommendations in 2017, people were not diagnosed with high blood pressure until they had measurements of 140/90 or higher.\n\nNot all doctors have been treating patients using the new, more aggressive blood pressure target, in part out of concern that long-term use of medications to lower blood pressure might have side effects, such as diarrhea or constipation, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, nausea or vomiting or mood disorders.\n\nWhile young adults with high blood pressure should consider the potential for medication side effects, they may be able to manage their blood pressure with lifestyle changes like eating better or exercising more, and they should discuss these options with their doctor, said the senior author of the Korean study, Dr. Sang-min Park of Seoul National University Hospital.\n\n\"We have shown that hypertension even at a young age may be associated with higher risk for heart attacks or strokes,\" Park said by email. \"Therefore, young adults with hypertension should have their blood pressure monitored on a regular basis and manage their blood pressure levels by lifestyle changes or medications.\"\n\nLifestyle changes are beneficial not only for reducing blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk, but could also lead to improved physical and mental health, Park noted.\n\nNeither study looked at whether aggressive blood pressure treatment might stop people from developing heart disease or dying from it.\n\nBut the results still suggest that treating blood pressure more aggressively at a younger age might help minimize the risk of premature heart problems later in life, said the U.S.-based study's lead author, Dr. Yuichiro Yano of Duke University.\n\n\"Our study is among the first to report that people younger than age 40 who have elevated blood pressure or hypertension are at increased risk of heart failure, strokes and blood vessel blockages as they age,\" Yano said by email.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy David Wasserman\n\nDemocrats swept all of the seats where they were favored and won or are ahead in 17 of the 30 seats the Cook Political Report rated as toss-ups. They also scored impressive upsets along the coast of South Carolina, in Oklahoma City and on Staten Island. With several uncalled races, it will take more time than usual to take stock of Tuesday's powerful, if uneven, wave. But here are a few initial impressions:\n\n1) This was mainly a suburban revolt. Democrats easily swept out most of the Republicans sitting in high-income suburban Hillary Clinton-won districts: Reps. Mike Coffman (CO-06), Peter Roskam (IL-06), Kevin Yoder (KS-03), Erik Paulsen (MN-03), Leonard Lance (NJ-07) and Barbara Comstock (VA-10), all by comfortable margins. Just about the only one in this category who may survive is Rep. Mimi Walters (CA-45).\n\nIn these seats, ads declaring that the Republican incumbent had voted with President Donald Trump \"95 percent of the time\" proved too much for them to overcome. But well-funded Democrats also broke through in outer, middle-class suburbs that Trump carried by single digits: Illinois's 14th District, Iowa's 3rd District, Michigan's 8th and 11th Districts and Virginia's 2nd and 7th Districts. Several were breakthroughs in places Barack Obama had never carried.\n\nHowever, Democrats didn't win a single Republican seat where Trump cracked 55 percent of the vote in 2016. They fell short in Florida's 6th District, Kansas's 2nd District and Kentucky's 6th District, despite multiple polls depicting competitive races. They also failed to hold onto two rural open seats in Minnesota and failed to knock off two indicted Republicans, Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York.\n\n2) Democrats' massive financial advantage helped overcome Republicans' structural geographic edge in the House. At this writing, Democrats lead in total votes cast for House by about 5.3 percent, and are leading Republicans in seats by about 5.7 percent. Democrats' popular vote lead will grow as more ballots are counted in states like California, Massachusetts and New York, perhaps to 7 points.\n\nIn other words, after all the hand-wringing about Republicans' built-in gerrymandering advantage, Democrats' share of votes roughly translated into their share of seats. A closer analysis suggests that's mostly because Democrats performed exceptionally well in the roughly 75 battleground districts they targeted, mostly because their candidates' massive fundraising advantages helped them control the late narrative.\n\n3) In the House, this was the \"Year of the Fired Up Female College Graduate.\" This was the first year in history Americans elected more than 100 women to the House, and it almost entirely driven by Democrats \u2014 a clear reaction to Trump's election. Of the 38 seats Democrats flipped or maintain a lead, women were the Democratic nominees in 21 \u2014 accounting for well over Democrats' margin in the House.\n\n4) This is also going to make it next to impossible for Democrats to ditch Nancy Pelosi, the first female speaker of the House. During the campaign, 37 Democrats on the DCCC's \"Red to Blue\" list publicly opposed Pelosi for speaker. But of those 37, only 10 prevailed and another five are in races that are too close to call. And a few \"no\" votes won with such comfortable enough margins that they are probably flippable.\n\nRepublicans, looking for a silver lining after Tuesday, are gleeful at the prospect of her return and argue it makes Democrats the instant underdogs to keep what may only be a 12-15 seat majority heading into 2020. After all, these Democrats campaigned on changing Washington and challenging both parties' leaders. Instead, their very first vote would be to fall in line behind the San Francisco-led old guard.\n\nIndeed, it's the Democrats who look like the more divided party as they assume power in the House. Their newcomers, mostly hailing from swing suburbs, campaigned on health care and pocketbook issues, not Russia, tweets or Trump. But the incoming committee chairs, almost all from urban and coastal districts, each have their own long lists of executive branch matters they want to investigate.\n\n5) The Republicans who survived in tough seats did so mostly by establishing their own moderate reputations before Trump took office. Reps. David Valadao (CA-21), John Katko (NY-24), Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) and Will Hurd (TX-23) all hung onto their seats by cultivating nonpartisan images a long time ago, much like the few younger, conservative Democrats who hung on in 2010.\n\nIn some respects, this was a mirror image of 2010. Much as the Blue Dogs were decimated in the 2010 wave, moderate \"Tuesday Group\" Republicans suffered large losses from both retirements like Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL-27) and Charlie Dent (PA-07), and defeats like Reps. Carlos Curbelo (FL-27) and Leonard Lance (NJ-07). The congressional GOP is about to become a more Trump-centric party.\n\nBonus takeaway: Democrats' hard pickup count is already at 31, according NBC's count, and their odds look good in many of the uncalled races. Democrats currently hold leads in four of the nine seats where the winner isn't clear: CA-48 (Rohrabacher), NJ-03 (MacArthur) and UT-04 (Love). In addition, Democrats are hopeful additional mail-in ballots will help their candidates overcome deficits in CA-10 (Denham) and CA-39 (Royce).\n\nMaine's 2nd District is the quirkiest nail-biter of all. GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin leads Democrat Jared Golden by less than 1,000 votes, but 22,000 cast ballots for left-leaning independents. Under the state's new \"ranked choice voting\" law, those independent voters' second and third choices will be added to the two contenders' totals sometime next week. Republicans fear Golden is the preferred second choice of most of those 22,000 voters.\n\nRepublicans maintain small leads in CA-45 (Walters), GA-07 (Woodall) and NC-09 (Open), but the counting of provisional ballots in each of these states could take weeks. Typically, late-counted mail-in and provisional ballots in California skew slightly to Democrats. The drama is set to last well beyond this week, and it's not inconceivable Democrats' eventual haul could be closer to 40 seats than 35.\n\nA version of this article was previously published in The Cook Political Report.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Steve Vladeck, Professor, University of Texas School of Law\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s removal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday afternoon, and his announcement that he was naming Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, as acting attorney general, is an alarming development from the perspective of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nUltimately, although the moves have raised a series of legal questions, it\u2019s fairly clear that the president\u2019s appointment was at least within the power that Congress has given him. Nevertheless, these developments ought to reignite concerns over the fate and future of the Mueller probe. They should also push Congress to finally pass the bipartisan legislation protecting Mueller\u2019s investigation that was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee back in April.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment does defy the traditional line of succession at the Department of Justice, however. By default, when the office of the attorney general is vacant, the deputy attorney general becomes the acting attorney general. This default rule is spelled out in the Justice Department\u2019s succession statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 508, and it\u2019s why Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has been supervising Mueller\u2019s investigation from the get-go (then-Attorney General Sessions had already recused himself before Mueller was even appointed.) Because there is currently no Senate-confirmed associate attorney general, the next in line after Rosenstein is the current solicitor general, Noel Francisco. As chief of staff to the attorney general, Whitaker does not appear at any place in the Justice Department\u2019s line of succession.\n\nInstead, Whitaker was named acting attorney general under a different statute, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. That statute allows the president to choose from a broader pool of candidates if a holder of certain executive branch offices \u201cdies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office.\u201d In addition to the \u201cfirst assistant\u201d to the vacant office (here, Rosenstein), the president can choose any other Senate-confirmed officer in the rest of the executive branch (think Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke) or certain non-Senate-confirmed senior officials who have served at least 90 of the last 365 days in a senior position at the same agency as the relevant office. Whitaker falls into this last category, and as the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel explained in a 2007 opinion, even though Congress has also passed a DOJ-specific succession statute, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act can also apply to vacancies in senior DOJ offices.\n\nThe harder legal question is whether Sessions in fact resigned. In his undated letter to the president, Sessions wrote that, \u201cAt your request, I am submitting my resignation.\u201d Taken together with media reports that Sessions had asked if he could remain on through the end of this week and had been rebuffed, the letter\u2019s first clause has led some to argue that Sessions was constructively fired \u2014 because he resigned only at the president\u2019s request.\n\nThis argument has some descriptive allure, but it is legally unpersuasive in the specific context of the Vacancies Reform Act. The question is not whether, as a practical matter, Sessions left of his own volition, but whether, formally, he \u201cresign[ed].\u201d Because Sessions could have refused to resign and forced Trump to fire him, it seems clear that, at least within the contours of the Vacancies Reform Act, he did, in fact, resign. Indeed, as much as any other officer in the federal government, the attorney general could certainly be expected to understand the legal significance of this linguistic distinction.\n\nThere is also a constitutional objection to having someone who has not been confirmed by the Senate serve on even a temporary basis in such a senior position. But as Justice Antonin Scalia explained in 2014, \u201cCongress can authorize \u2018acting\u2019 officers to perform the duties associated with a temporarily vacant office \u2014 and has done that, in one form or another, since 1792.\u201d\n\nAlthough his appointment will surely be challenged in court, it appears that Whitaker is properly appointed as the acting attorney general, which means he can serve in that capacity for approximately seven months, or until a new, permanent attorney general is confirmed by the Senate \u2014 whichever comes first. (The Constitution also allows the office to be filled on a permanent basis through a \u201crecess appointment,\u201d but there is no indication that Congress will take a qualifying recess anytime soon.)\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker supplants Rosenstein as Mueller\u2019s immediate supervisor (unless, like Sessions, he must also recuse from the matter). As such, he inherits the authority, among other things, to control the scope of Mueller\u2019s investigation and, if necessary, to fire him \u201cfor misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause.\u201d\n\nGiven Whitaker\u2019s sustained prior critiques of Mueller\u2019s investigation, the million-dollar question is whether he\u2019ll act on those critiques and take steps to influence the special counsel. He could do this in a variety of ways, whether by reducing his budget, narrowing his jurisdiction, barring him from bringing specific indictments, sitting on his final report, or going for the jugular by simply getting rid of him. Time will tell, but it\u2019s not exactly reassuring that Trump has apparently told advisers that Whitaker was chosen because of his \u201cloyalty.\u201d\n\nWorried about exactly this scenario, Congress has, since the middle of 2017, debated a series of proposals to protect Mueller and his investigation, culminating in a bipartisan bill \u2014 the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act \u2014 that was passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 14-7 vote back in April. Among other things, the bill would empower Congress to obtain any final report filed by Mueller, and it would provide for judicial review of whether, if Mueller is indeed fired, it was with the requisite \u201cgood cause.\u201d But even though four Republicans joined the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee in supporting its passage, the bill has languished ever since, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly insisting that it\u2019s not \u201cnecessary.\u201d\n\nSo long as the Mueller investigation was supervised by Rosenstein, there was at least a whiff of plausibility to that argument, because there was still at least one canary in the proverbial coal mine. As of yesterday afternoon, there isn\u2019t anymore. If passage of the bill isn\u2019t \u201cnecessary\u201d now, it won\u2019t be necessary until the moment after Mueller\u2019s investigation has been denuded, or Mueller himself has been fired. At that point, which may be coming sooner rather than later, it will be too late.", "This Month in History: The Fall of the Berlin Wall (Part 2) copied!\n\nNightly Films looks back at the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, breaking the barrier between socialist East Germany and democratic West Germany.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It quickly filled up with comments from medical professionals and supporters pointing out the effects gun violence has on them and their patients. Emergency professionals also often posted pictures of their bloody scrubs, or puddles of blood on emergency room floors -- the result of treating gunshot victims.\n\nDoctors and medical officials have increasingly taken on gun violence as a public health issue. Last month, the American College of Physicians issued new guidelines for doctors to follow in helping protect patients from firearms dangers, and published several reports on gun violence in its flagship publication, the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n\u201cWe need to ask our patients about firearms, counsel them on safe firearm behaviors, and take further action when an imminent hazard is present,\u201d Dr. Garen Wintemute, of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California Davis Medical Center, wrote in one editorial in the magazine.\n\nOn Wednesday, the NRA took issue with the ACP, which represents more than 150,000 internal medicine specialists. \u201cSomeone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane,\u201d the group tweeted.\n\nDoctors across Twitter piled back on.\n\n\u201cWe are not anti-gun; we are anti-bullet holes in our patients,\u201d retorted emergency medicine specialist Dr. Esther Choo of Oregon Health & Science University in a tweet Thursday morning.\n\nDr. Joseph Sakran, director of emergency general surgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine, tweeted his dismay over the gun advocacy group's \u201cdivisive statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take care of these patients every day. Where are you when I\u2019m having to tell all those families their loved one has died?,\" he wrote.\n\nAnd the Annals of Internal Medicine, the influential journal for the ACP, tweeted a pledge to its 33,000 followers to talk to at-risk patients about gun violence.\n\nDoctors have increasingly fought for more freedom to research gun violence and deaths and to speak to patients about the risks. In Florida, lawmakers sought to prevent doctors from asking about guns in the home but in 2017 a federal appeals court ruled against the law.\n\nAnd Congress had quietly limited CDC research into firearms violence using carefully worded legislation and budget cuts that precisely matched the CDC\u2019s budget for such research.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama directed the CDC to resume gun research.\n\nRise in violent crimes, suicide\n\nThe CDC published new data on Thursday showing that gun deaths rose in 2015-16 after having started to fall in earlier years. The report says the rise in deaths is driven by both violent crime and by suicides.\n\n\u201cDuring 2015\u20132016, homicide was the 16th leading cause of death among persons of all ages in the United States and the third leading cause among youths aged 10\u201319 years; a firearm injury was the underlying cause of death in 74 percent of all homi\u00adcides and in 87 percent of youth homicides,\u201d the CDC team said in the new report.\n\nMore than 27,000 people were killed by guns in 2015-16 and nearly 45,000 people died by suicide using a firearm, the CDC said.\n\n\u201cPreviously observed decreases in firearm homicide rates have not continued, with more recent rates showing an increase both nationally and in large (urban areas),\u201d the CDC team wrote.\n\n\u201cIt is too soon to know whether recent increases in fire\u00adarm homicide rates represent a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a longer-term trend,\u201d the team added.\n\n\u201cFrom 2015 to 2016, violent crime increased 3.8 percent for the nation overall, 6.1 percent in cities with populations of 250,000 and higher, 2.2 percent in suburban areas and 1.6 percent in nonmetropolitan counties.\u201d\n\nThe CDC did not advocate for removing guns from legal gun owners but said the easy availability of guns is one clear factor in the rise. Research shows the decision to die by suicide is often a last-minute thought.\n\n\u201cReducing access to lethal means during an acute suicidal crisis by safely storing firearms or temporarily removing them from the home can help reduce suicide risk, particularly among youths,\u201d the team wrote.\n\n\u201cEfforts to strengthen household financial security; stabilize housing; teach youths coping and problem-solving skills; identify and support persons at risk; and imple\u00adment proactive prevention policies in schools, workplaces, and other organizational settings are associated with reductions in suicide,\u201d the CDC team added.\n\nCareful policing can help reduce homicides, the CDC team said. So can community efforts such as business improvement districts, housing tax credits and cleaning up abandoned buildings and lots. Restraining orders against people with a history of domestic violence can prevent homicides, as can background checks for gun buyers.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The FDA revoked marketing permission because the inhaler was driven by ozone-destroying CFC chemicals.\n\nNow it can come back, using a less-dangerous gas to propel the medication.\n\n\u201cSome may remember the former over-the-counter Primatene Mist that was taken off the market in 2011 because it contained chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants, which are known to deplete the ozone layer,\u201d the FDA said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis new version contains hydrofluoroalkane propellants, which are permitted under current international and U.S. law. Prescription-only inhalers that use different medications, such as albuterol and levalbuterol, also use HFAs as propellants.\u201d\n\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals says the inhaler will cost about $25 and should be on the shelves by the end of the year.\n\nDoctors are worried that people will stop using prescription inhalers to buy the cheaper Primatene product.

But it can cause sometimes dangerous side-effects, including fast heartbeat and raised blood pressure. The danger to patients with asthma is that they won\u2019t have the right medication on hand if they have a severe attack.\n\nThe FDA said the approval is only for people whose doctors have told them it\u2019s all right to use.\n\n\u201cThe new product is only appropriate for those with a diagnosis of mild, intermittent asthma. Patients with more severe asthma should not rely on it. Instead, they should be working with their health care provider to ensure an appropriate treatment plan for their condition,\u201d the FDA said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to note that Primatene Mist is not a replacement for prescription asthma treatments. Patients with asthma should be under the care of a health care professional.\u201d\n\nThe ACAAI says 3,500 people die from asthma every year.\n\nThe FDA notes that the decision to remove Primatene Mist from the market was controversial. Patients with mild asthma liked using it, and some people with no health insurance relied on having an over-the-counter product.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we also heard from practitioners concerned with the product remaining on the market. They believed asthma patients could be harmed by self-medicating with an OTC product and that appropriate asthma care included regular care and supervised care by a health care provider, including the use of inhaled corticosteroids or other controller medications to reduce inflammation and the incidence of exacerbations,\u201d the FDA said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, told The Associated Press on Thursday night.\n\n\"The wind that was predicted came\" and pummeled the city of 27,000 residents in the Sierra Nevada foothills, he said.\n\nThe fire had more than doubled in size to 20,000 acres and was at 0 percent containment, Cal Fire reported Thursday night.\n\nAt a news conference, Chief Darren Read, commander of Cal Fire's Butte County Unit, described \"significant\" losses of structures and multiple injuries, including injuries to two firefighters.\n\nSIGN UP HERE FOR BREAKING NEWS EMAILS\n\nResidents in Pulga and Paradise, about 90 miles north of Sacramento, were told to evacuate on Thursday morning.\n\nBy the afternoon, residents of Magalia, Concow, Butte Creek Canyon and Butte Valley had also been told to leave \u2014 more than 20,000 people in all, including all patients at Adventist Health Feather River Hospital, the hospital confirmed.\n\nThe Camp Fire rages through Paradise, California, on Thursday.

Not one home will be left standing. I'm devastated.\"\n\nBrian Wilson of Magalia was at work when the fire erupted and spent much of Thursday frantically trying to reach his wife, who was at home with their two young children.\n\n\"There's no way to get ahold of anybody up there. The lines are all down,\" Wilson told NBC affiliate KCRA of Sacramento, his voice cracking. \"She's at home with two kids by herself. I can't do anything.\"\n\nWilson's wife later called to say that she and the children had managed to escape safely, KCRA reported.\n\nMeanwhile, in Southern California, a brushfire that ignited Thursday afternoon quickly grew to encompass 10,000 acres only a few miles from the scene of the shooting at a bar where a gunman killed 12 people in Ventura County.\n\nThe Hill Fire sparked in the Santa Rosa Valley jumped U.S. Highway 101 at about 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) and in less than an hour was nearing the boundary of Thousand Oaks, fire officials said. It jumped U.S. Highway 101 within 12 minutes, Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said.\n\nIts progress slowed as it reached areas stripped of fuel by previous fires and was assessed to be burning 5,000 to 7,000 acres by Thursday night, he said.\n\nA police officer directs traffic at a checkpoint in front of an advancing wildfire near Newbury Park, California, on Thursday.

Like the Super Bowl or World Series, elections provide CNN, MSNBC and Fox News with a captive audience of news junkies ready to spend the next six hours looking at color-coded maps.\n\nThe midterm elections do not traditionally attract the same enthusiasm as presidential contests, but the current hyper-partisan atmosphere provided a sense of urgency and a jolt of energy for Tuesday\u2019s midterms. The result was that cable news had a lot more competition than, say, \u201cPBS Newshour.\u201d\n\nEven late-night comedians seemed eager to join in the action. \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers,\u201d \u201cThe Daily Show with Trevor Noah\u201d and \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d all produced live election shows, announcing election returns on the air, some of which broke during the broadcasts themselves. Colbert even had a running ticker at the bottom of the screen with voter tallies updating in real time.\n\nTurns out the people best equipped to cover a political environment lead by a reality-show star are people who have at least one foot rooted in show business themselves.\n\nTheir coverage, both jokey and serious, put some of the more traditional shows to shame in the process. Turns out some of the people best equipped to cover a political environment lead by a reality-show star are people who have at least one foot rooted in show business themselves. Their perspectives provided a timely, relatable frame of reference for viewers looking for clarity on what was happening \u2014 and why it mattered.\n\nSpeaking truth to power using comedy isn\u2019t new, but late-night comedy has not always been so overtly political. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, hosts like David Letterman and Jay Leno may have made the odd joke at the news\u2019 expense, but it wasn\u2019t their focus \u2014 and they certainly didn\u2019t produce live election night specials.\n\nThis began to change with the 2000 election, when Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart\u201d extensively covered the race for the White House. Stewart took over the series from Craig Kilborn a year earlier, and his obsession with politics and news changed the series\u2019 focus from celebrity gossip into the satirical show people think of today. Colbert was already a member of the \u201cDaily Show\u201d cast when Stewart arrived, and his parody of a Republican-leaning correspondent was a career breakthrough. When 2008 rolled around, Colbert anchored \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d as a companion piece to Stewart\u2019s half hour. It was a political parody dream team.\n\nColbert made the jump to CBS in 2015, bringing along these live parody broadcasts. His coverage of the 2016 Republican and Democratic conventions helped push him ahead of long-time rival \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d Naturally, \u201cThe Late Show\u201d also went live on election night, bringing the now-Comedy Central-staple to network. Like in 2008, Colbert anticipated another historic first. But when Trump came out on top, the results were more fascinating than if Hillary won; Colbert had to keep a visibly upset and shaken live audience calm on the air.\n\nIt may have been a rocky night, but the media attention Colbert got for it proved irresistible. CBS discovered that the more the \u201cLate Show\u201d host was openly opinionated about the Trump administration, the better his ratings become. The show shot to number one in the late-night series race the night Trump was inaugurated, and has stayed there ever since. Likewise, over on ABC, their late-night show \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d a relative newcomer to the format, discovered Kimmel\u2019s reviews went through the roof when he came out against the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nMeanwhile, over on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d Jimmy Fallon\u2019s longtime flagship of a show has languished, a slump some people connect to Fallon\u2019s fawning Trump interview during the campaign. \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers,\u201d which follows it at 12:30 a.m., has been on the rise, however. Meyers\u2019 show is perhaps the most hard-hitting of all the broadcast late night shows, often coming off as a broadcast variant of HBO\u2019s lauded \u201cLast Week with John Oliver.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, however, Meyers was part of a crowded field. Colbert and Kimmel both presented live, leaving only Fallon sitting on the sidelines, preempted by the hard news teams. On cable, \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d now hosted by Trevor Noah, also broadcast live, as has been the tradition for a decade.\n\nBut though Colbert now treads softer and sillier than his old \u201cColbert Report\u201d segments, he still has a massive one-up on cable news when it comes to election coverage. Unlike channels like CNN, which strive to be perceived as even-handed, Colbert can call out the political realities of the moment. Indeed, Colbert was the first to savor the idea that at least there\u2019s now one small check in the balance\u2019s column.\n\nKimmel took aim at the more frivolous (yet funny) portions of stereotypical election night bells and whistles, with segments like \u201cThe Night of 1000 Graphs\u201d and \u201cThe Wall of Wolf Blitzers.\u201d Meanwhile Meyers, who airs an hour after everyone else had thus a bit more time to prepare, put together one of his classic ten-minute deep dives (entitled \u201cA Closer Look\u201d), exploring what Democrats retaking the House majority means in context of Trump\u2019s next two years. If anything, the \u201cDaily Show\u201d was left in the proverbial dust, as the broadcast shows recorded above average numbers.\n\nColbert captured the biggest overall audience of the evening, but even Kimmel could boast that his show pulled in an audience not seen since last spring. The numbers weren\u2019t Fox News level, but viewers still tuned in in droves, and that\u2019s not counting the millions of cord-cutters who watched the next morning on YouTube.\n\nUnlike in 2016, liberals had plenty to celebrate on Tuesday \u2014 despite losing some ground in the Senate \u2014 and the election was a historic one for women and minorities, with over 100 women to the 435-seat chamber. But while the experts and pundits on CNN, MSNBC and Fox had plenty of pie charts and exit polls to play with, Colbert and company did an excellent job of ultimately putting the night in perspective.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have taken control of half of one of three branches of the government,\u201d Colbert noted in his opening monologue. \u201cAll the GOP has is the other half of Congress, the Supreme Court and the president who does whatever he wants.\u201d Talk about a mic drop.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Ken Dilanian and Julia Ainsley\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the summer of 2017, when Matthew Whitaker was a conservative legal commentator on CNN, he repeatedly expressed reservations about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, at one point musing about how a clever attorney general could secretly starve it of funds.\n\nTwo years before, Whitaker, a former Iowa federal prosecutor, was the campaign chairman for an Iowa politician who later became an important witness in Mueller's probe of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nNow, Whitaker is the acting attorney general, and one of his jobs is to supervise the Mueller investigation. He has shown no indication that he will heed the advice of Democrats and legal ethicists, who say there is a clear case that he should recuse himself from that role. There is no legal mechanism to force his recusal.\n\n\"Based on what Mr. Whitaker has said in the past about the Mueller investigation, his assumption of responsibility over the investigation certainly raises the appearance of impropriety,\" said Mary McCord, who headed the Justice Department's National Security Division under President Obama from 2016 to 2017. \"I would hope that, at a minimum, he would consult with ethics experts at the Department before assuming that responsibility.\"\n\nWhitaker, a physically imposing man who played tight end for the University of Iowa team that lost the 1991 Rose Bowl, served most recently as chief of staff for Jeff Sessions, who was forced out by President Donald Trump on Wednesday.\n\nIn the Justice Department, Whitaker was viewed as an agent of the White House, one administration official and one former U.S. attorney told NBC News.\n\n\"It's no secret where his loyalties lie \u2014 they're with the White House more than with the Department,\" the official said.\n\nInstead of turning to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to become the acting attorney general, Trump placed Whitaker in that role. Rosenstein, a career public servant, had been supervising the Mueller investigation because Sessions had been recused, due to his prominent role in the Trump presidential campaign. With Sessions gone, the acting attorney general retains the role of overseeing Mueller \u2014 approving budgets, and signing off on new investigative steps or indictments. It is believed the acting attorney general would have to approve the politically fraught move of issuing a subpoena for the president's testimony \u2014 unless Mueller has already secured one with Rosenstein's OK.\n\nAs a commentator, Whitaker expressed opinions on exactly the issues about which he may now have to decide.\n\nFor example, in an Aug. 2017 CNN op-ed, Whitaker wrote that Mueller's investigation was at risk of becoming a \"witch hunt.\" He added, channeling comments, by Trump, that it would be \"dangerously close to crossing [a] red line\" if Mueller looked into Trump's finances.\n\nBefore that, in July, Whitaker brainstormed in a television appearance about how Trump could constrain Mueller.\n\n\"I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment,\" Whitaker said, \"and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\"\n\nThat same month, in another appearance, Whitaker defended Donald Trump Jr.'s decision to take a meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June 2016, after he was promised incriminating information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government.\n\n\"You would always take the meeting,\" he said.\n\nIn an Aug. 17 tweet, Whitaker seemed to criticize the FBI's search of the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has since pleaded guilty and is cooperating with Mueller.\n\n\"Do we want our Gov't to 'intimidate' us? Hmm,\" he tweeted, linking to a Fox News story with the headline \"FBI's Manafort raid included a dozen agents, 'designed to intimidate,' source says.\"\n\nAnd in May 2017, speaking on Fox News host Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show, Whitaker opined that the president did not obstruct justice when he urged then-FBI director James Comey to stop investigating his then-national security adviser, Mike Flynn.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t rise to the level of obstruction of justice, and it doesn\u2019t sound to me based on what\u2019s been reported that Jim Comey, as he sat there, believed that the president was telling him to stop the investigation,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cif all he did was make a mere suggestion and not an outright command, I don\u2019t think that rises to the level of obstruction.\u201d\n\nDo we want our Gov't to \"intimidate\" us? Hmm -FBI's Manafort raid incl. a dozen agents, 'designed to intimidate,' | https://t.co/KAHQq26q2M \u2014 Matt Whitaker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@MattWhitaker46) August 25, 2017\n\nLegal experts say there are two grounds on which Whitaker should remove himself from any involvement in the Mueller investigation: His relationship with Sam Clovis and his past statements criticizing the investigation.\n\nA Justice Department regulation says that no employee should participate in an investigation \"if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation.\"\n\nClovis testified before the Mueller grand jury, and he was listed as an unnamed \"campaign supervisor\" in the indictment of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\n\nClovis was present at a meeting, along with Sessions and Trump, during which Papadopoulos says he broached the idea of Trump meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBoth Clovis and Whitaker ran in a Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in Iowa in 2014, and during that time they became \"great friends,\" Clovis said in a later statement.\n\n\"I respect and admire Dr. Clovis,\" Whitaker was quoted as saying. \"His life is an example of strong service to God and service to country.\n\nKathleen Clark, a law professor and ethics expert at Washington University, says that friendship would appear to be grounds for recusal. But equally problematic, she says, are Whitaker's statements suggesting he is not impartial about the Mueller investigation.\n\nFederal ethics regulations that apply government-wide state that a government employee should consider stepping aside in a matter when \"the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter.\"\n\n\"I believe that there are circumstances that would raise a question in the minds of a reasonable person about Whitaker's impartiality in the Russia investigation,\" Clark said. \"We as the public have a right to be assured that the people who are participating in that investigation are impartial.\"\n\nBut there is no enforcement mechanism. A former Justice Department official said it is up to Whitaker to seek the advice of ethics officials in the Office of Government Ethics or the Justice Department's ethics office.\n\n\"It's incumbent upon the person,\" the official said. \"There is no ethics policeman wandering around the Department.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Karen Handel, the Republican who won a high-profile Georgia special election last year, conceded to challenger Lucy McBath, bringing the party's net gain of seats in Tuesday's midterm elections to 30.\n\nThat number could grow again in coming days as more outstanding races are called. Many analysts have estimated that the number will climb closer to 38 seats by the time all votes are counted, and a dozen competitive House contests remained too close to call by midday Thursday.\n\nFor comparison, Democrats won 31 House seats in their 2006 wave election, which then-Republican President George W. Bush deemed a \u201cthumping,\u201d while Republicans won 63 in 2010. In both cases, however, the out-of-power party also made gains in the Senate, while this year, Democrats lost ground there even while flipping the House.\n\nKaren Handel Drew Angerer / Getty Images\n\nNBC News projected Thursday that McBath is the apparent winner in the race, while Handel told supporters in an email that she had reviewed the data and concluded, \"It is clear that I came up a bit short on Tuesday.\"\n\nHandel congratulated McBath, an African-American Democrat who got involved in political activism after her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was fatally shot by a white man in an incident that drew national attention.\n\nHandel occupied the seat for barely more than a year after winning the most expensive House race in history, the 2017 special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff, who was dissuaded from running again this year.\n\nMcBath will be the first Democrat to represent the district, which includes parts of the North Atlanta suburbs, since the Jimmy Carter administration. Former occupants of the seat include former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tom Price, President Donald Trump's first Health and Human Services secretary, who resigned from that job amid controversy last year.\n\nThe neighboring district, Georgia's 7th, remains surprisingly close, with Republican Rep. Rob Woodall holding a narrow lead over Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux as the final outcome remains unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Steve Knight, R-Calif., conceded a Los Angeles-area congressional district that includes the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to 31-year-old Democratic challenger Katie Hill. She is the apparent winner in that race, NBC News projected Thursday.\n\nIn Orange County, California, Democrat Harley Rouda leads Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, while Democrat Mike Levin is ahead in the neighboring district formerly occupied by retiring Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, though NBC News deems both races too close to call.\n\nRepublicans look likely to hang on to two other contested Southern California districts. It may take days for final results in the Golden State, since voters are allowed to mail their absentee ballots as late as Election Day.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican congressional candidate Dino Rossi conceded to Democrat Kim Schrier in a contest for a Washington state House district that includes both wealthy suburbs and rural farmland.\n\nDemocrats also lead in too-close-to-call races in New Jersey, Maine, New Mexico and Utah, where former Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams is outpacing Rep. Mia Love, the Republican incumbent. Trump trashed her during a news conference Wednesday, saying, \u201cLove gave me no love.\u201d\n\nRepublicans picked up two Democratic-held seats in traditionally blue parts of rural Minnesota, even as Democrats flipped two GOP-held suburb seats there and won big statewide, reflecting the large political realignment evident in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the latest race calls.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Our campaign, along with our attorney Barry Richard, is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount.\"\n\nIt continued, \"Mayor Gillum started his campaign for the people, and we are committed to ensuring every single vote in Florida is counted.\"\n\nNBC News has called DeSantis the \"apparent\" winner in the governor race, while votes are still being counted in places like Broward County and margins appear to be tightening slightly.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida's Senate race featuring Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson against Republican Rick Scott seemed to be heading for a recount, which is automatically triggered when the vote difference is less than 0.5 percent. It is currently .2 percent, fewer than 22,000 votes, according to NBC News.\n\nThe deadline for all 67 Florida counties to submit their first set of unofficial returns is Saturday at noon ET, according to the secretary of state's office.\n\nIn a call with reporters Thursday, Nelson lawyer Marc Elias said that the race currently stands as a \"jump ball\" as counties around the state canvass their votes, but he believes Nelson will remain senator once the recount dust settles.\n\nThe Scott campaign, for its part, released a statement Thursday attacking Nelson for hiring a D.C. lawyer in an attempt to \"steal\" the election. Scott declared victory Tuesday night, but NBC News has not yet called the race.\n\nThe Sunshine State is no stranger to lengthy post-election battles.

Anxiety is fear and those anxious thoughts are trying to protect us from something horrible. So instead of being hard on ourselves about these thoughts, thank them for what they are trying to do and make a decision on how to proceed in a much clearer state of mind.\u201d\n\nDownload a meditation/mindfulness app\n\n\u201cApps like Headspace or Calm are interactive, supportive, and help to hold you accountable,\u201d says Katie Krimer, a licensed clinical social worker. \u201cThey are an active way to productively address your anxious thoughts and increase self-awareness. At best, your anxiety is minimized, at worst, you've taken some time to gently observe how busy your mind is.\u201d\n\nGet grounded in your space\n\nNatalie Finegood Goldberg, a licensed marriage and family therapist recommends practicing physical grounding.\n\n\u201cThis means shifting out of your head and into your body,\u201d Goldberg explains. \u201cThis can be done by throwing a tennis ball against a wall, standing in place and shifting your weight back and forth, or any act that allows you to focus on the connection of your body to anything physical. In doing so, you create a shift in the nervous system that allows your body to slow down so you can return to a healthy equilibrium that allows for rational thought.\u201d\n\nShift your thoughts to your surroundings\n\nAnother way of grounding yourself is by shifting your attention to your physical surroundings.\n\n\u201cWhen we are engaging in a lot of anxious thinking, we are over-identifying with those thoughts and getting caught up in their content,\u201d says Krimer. \u201cThe practice of stepping back and acknowledging objective reality (i.e. labeling items in the room using your five senses), it can help create space from those thoughts.\u201d\n\nWrite it out\n\nJust as journaling can benefit a gratitude, positivity or self-care practice, it can help us get anxious thoughts out of our head and on to paper.\n\n\u201cOne of the main benefits is that journaling helps you work on having a deeper understanding of your triggers so that you are more prepared on how to deal with them,\u201d says Celeste Viciere, a licensed mental health clinicial.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling blocked looking at a blank page, try guided journaling, or google \u201cjournal prompts for anxiety\u201d and you\u2019ll find tons of cues to get you started.\n\nLog (and dispute) the bad thoughts\n\nYou can also use a journal to log and refute anxious thoughts.\n\n\u201cWrite your anxious thought down, e.g. \u2018I am a loser.\u2019 Then refute that thought, e.g. \u2018It is true that I have indeed lost many things before, but I have also won and succeeded at many things,\u2019\u201d says Dr. Nancy Irwin, a psychologist with Seasons in Malibu. \u201cThe more you log these anxious thoughts and respond to them in a logical fashion, the less of those unhelpful thoughts you will have. Your brain starts to short-circuit the unnecessary thoughts, and you begin having fewer and less severe anxious thoughts.\u201d\n\nDo some art: Discipline downshifts the nervous system\n\nOne of licensed professional counselor Essence Cohen Fields\u2019 top recommendations to clients dealing with anxious thoughts is to express themselves through art.\n\n\u201cTake up a new instrument, paint or write poetry,\u201d she says. \u201cFocusing on an activity that requires discipline allows you to channel your anxiety and excessive energy into something more useful.\u201d\n\nYou can even engage in something very simple, like coloring.\n\n\u201cAdult coloring books [and apps] are great for relieving anxiety. Or make some homemade play-doh or a glitter jar,\u201d say Goldberg. The sensory experience is great for downshifting your nervous system.\u201d\n\nCreate positive alternatives to worrying unknowns\n\n\u201cAnxiety tends to make people feel like there is one thought or conscious stream of thoughts that has only one answer to a problem,\u201d notes Cummins. \u201cThe goal with anxious thoughts is to assess the thoughts that are the loudest, and create alternative thoughts that are productive. For example, are you stuck on worry or concern that is negative? If you come up with positive alternatives, you access the ability to link your emotion to positive alternative thoughts.\u201d\n\nCreate a mantra that soothes the anxiety\n\n\u201cWhen we get in our heads, we worry a lot about the \u2018what ifs\u2019,\u201d says Evanye Lawson, licensed professional counselor. \u201cWhen we get in that space it gets harder for us to take action or move forward, so one way to combat this is the tell yourself \u2018when this is over, I will be glad I did it,\u2019 or \u2018it may be hard now, but it will get better or easier over time. I will keep trying.\u2019\u201d\n\nDesignate a friend who will just simply listen\n\n\u201cAsk a friend if they would be willing to sit with you on the phone or in person and let you speak about all the issues you have without trying to offer advice, their opinions or their judgments unless you ask for it,\u201d says Lawson. \u201cIf that friend says yes, then when you are in a moment where you need that friend, reach out to them by first asking if they are free to hold space for you while you tell them about the things making you anxious. Your friend will automatically know what to do since you previously told them how you needed and now you can rest assured that you have support. Remember consent is important in this tip.\u201d\n\nSchedule \u2018worry time\u2019\n\nOne of the trickiest traits of anxiety is the sense of urgency it brings. Remind yourself that you'll have time for thinking later (when you\u2019re in a clearer state of mind), and schedule time to do just that.\n\n\u201cSet aside a time during the day during which you give yourself permission to worry \u2014 you can even have a reminder in your calendar,\u201d says Krimer. \u201cAcknowledge that thinking will happen whether you like it or not, and some of it might be anxious. In the mean time, remember how good it will feel to turn those anxious thoughts into productivity and positive action.

Google will consolidate its channels for reporting misconduct into one site with live support, the company said. It also will provide \u201cextended counseling and career support\u201d for employees making allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nOrganizers of the protests had demanded Google put an end to its policy of forced arbitration for sexual misconduct allegations \u2014 a common practice among technology companies that typically takes place behind closed doors and can involve confidentiality clauses. Critics of the practice said it limits workers from speaking out about their experiences.\n\nMeredith Whittaker, the lead of Google's Open Research group, tweeted on Thursday: \"Collective action works. It will continue working.\"\n\nGoogle said it will also provide more transparency to employees about incidents reported to the company around sexual harassment investigations and outcomes as part of its annual \"Investigations Report\" and dock employees in their performance reviews if they do not complete mandatory sexual harassment training, Pichai said.\n\nThe organizers of the Google walkout wrote in a blog post that the company \"made progress\" in addressing their complaints but noted that some demands had been ignored, including adding an employee representative to the company's board.\n\nThey also said that the company ignored their requests to address issues around \"racism, discrimination and structural inequity.\"\n\n\u201cWe demand a truly equitable culture, and Google leadership can achieve this by putting employee representation on the board and giving full rights and protections to contract workers, our most vulnerable workers, many of whom are Black and Brown women,\" Stephanie Parker, a policy specialist on Google's trust and safety team and one of the walkout organizers, said in the post.\n\nThe move comes a week after an estimated 20,000 employees worldwide, including in London, Singapore and the company\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, California, staged protests following a report by the New York Times detailing how the tech giant protected key male executives and other male workers accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe Times article revealed that the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin, had committed sexual misconduct.

The shooting took place at Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles west of Los Angeles, during a college night for people 18 and older.\n\nThe shooting is said to be the 307th mass shooting in the United States this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nWhere did the shooting happen?\n\nThe shooting happened around 11:20 p.m. (2:20 a.m. ET) at Borderline Bar and Grill, a popular venue for country music lovers. The bar boasts that it was named Ventura County\u2019s Largest Country Dance Hall & Live Music Venue for over 25 years and has a 2,500 square feet of wide-open dance floor.\n\nBig-name stars like The Beach Boys, Mark Chestnutt, Collin Raye and Lee Brice have performed at the venue, which opened in Malibu, California in the late 1980s before relocating to Thousand Oaks in 1993.\n\nThe bar hosts a \"college country night\" every Wednesday for people 18 and older, according to its website. Pepperdine University in Malibu tweeted that several of its students were at the bar at the time of the shooting, but could not confirm if they were among those killed or injured.\n\nWho is the gunman?\n\nVentura County Sheriff Geoff Dean identified the suspected shooter as 28-year-old Ian David Long, who was a machine gunner in the Marines and served from 2008 to 2013.\n\nDuring his time in the military, Long, who was a corporal, was deployed in Afghanistan and received multiple awards including Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, an Afghanistan Campaign Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and a National Defense Service Medal.\n\nSergeant Eric Buschow, with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, said on MSNBC that Long also served in the reserves.\n\nIan David Long, 28, who is a veteran of the Marines, has been identified as the shooter at Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California. via Facebook\n\nLong was found dead inside Borderline Bar and Grill from a gunshot wound, authorities said. Dean said it's believed it self-inflicted, but it's still being investigated.\n\nLong was dressed in all black when he stormed into the venue and several witnesses told authorities that they saw smoke bombs going off inside the bar, but officials have not confirmed this.\n\nDean said the department had several previous interactions with Long for minor events such as a traffic accident. In 2015, Long was the victim of battery at a different bar in Thousand Oaks.\n\nIn April, deputies were called to his home in April by family members who were concerned about the \"behavior that he exhibited,\" Buschow said. Dean said during the news conference that Long was acting erratically and a crisis intervention team was called. Authorities eventually cleared Long and determined that a psychiatric hold was not necessary.\n\nWhat kind of gun was used?\n\nAuthorities said they believe Long used a single .45 caliber Glock 21 handgun to carry out the attack. Dean said the gun is designed to hold 10 rounds and one in the chamber, but it could have held more because it was fitted with an extended magazine.\n\nFormer New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton, an MSNBC contributor, said the extended magazine could have given Long 30 shots and possibly more if he reloaded.\n\n\"We do not know at this time how many rounds were actually in the weapon or how many rounds the magazine could actually hold because it's still being processed as part of the evidence,\" Dean said.\n\nWho are the victims?\n\nThe sheriff's department is still working to identify those killed in the shooting. Several hundred people were inside the venue when gunfire erupted. Dean described the incident as a \"tragic, tragic situation.\"\n\nAuthorities confirmed Thursday that Sgt. Ron Helus, 54, was as a victim of the shooting.\n\nHelus, along with a colleague from the California Highway Patrol, arrived at the bar within three minutes of reports of shots being fired, Dean said. Helus entered the bar to confront the gunman, while the patrol officer watched the perimeter, according to officials.\n\nHelus was struck multiple times, and was dragged out of the line of fire by the patrol officer. Helus, who had a wife and son, died from his injuries in the hospital hours later. Dean said Helus was about a year from retiring from the department. He was hailed a hero for his quick actions.\n\n\u201cRon was a great guy,\" Dean said during Thursday's news conference. \"Hearts are broken all over.\"\n\nCody Coffman, 22, was also identified as another victim by his father, Jason.\n\nJason Coffman told reporters that his son was talking to recruiters about joining the army and was eagerly awaiting the birth of his first sister later this month.\n\nCal Lutheran alumni Justin Meek, 23, also died, school officials confirmed.\n\nThe school said Meek, who graduated in May, \"heroically saved lives in the incident.\" Students at the school said witnesses at the bar told them that Meek jumped in front of his sister and others to shield them from Long.\n\nAlso killed in the shooting was Pepperdine student Alaina Housley, the niece of former Fox News correspondent Adam Housley and his wife, actress Tamera Mowry-Housley.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken. We just learned that our niece Alaina was one of the victims of last night\u2019s shooting at Borderline bar in Thousand Oaks,\" the couple said in a joint statement Thursday. \"Alaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner.\"\n\nTo escape the gunfire, officials said bar-goers hid in bathrooms and in the venue's attic. Witnesses told authorities that some people used bar stools and chairs to smash the windows so they could flee.

Minching, as well as incumbent Tony Avella, who lost the Democratic primary to Liu in September, according to unofficial results.\n\nAvella, whose state Senate district encompasses neighborhoods in the New York City borough of Queens, still ran in the general election, though not as a Democrat.\n\nMeanwhile, unofficial results out on Long Island showed that attorney Kevin Thomas, an immigrant from India, appeared to eke out a victory against Republican incumbent Kemp Hannon, whose district covers parts of Nassau County.\n\nCome January, assuming the results stand, Liu and Thomas will join Democratic assembly members Ron Kim and Yuh-Line Niou as the state legislature\u2019s four Asian-American lawmakers.\n\nAsians make up around 9 percent of the state\u2019s total population, according to census figures.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to inject a voice that had been absent prior,\u201d Liu said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd the goal is also to vigorously represent the needs of this community that I\u2019ve lived in my whole life, and grown up in, and am raising my own family in.\u201d\n\nAs of Thursday morning, unofficial results from the New York City Board of Elections had Liu with around 54 percent of the vote, Paladino at 24 percent, Avella at 21 percent and Minching at 1 percent with close to 97 percent of scanners reporting.\n\nThe race between Thomas and Hannon was much tighter.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Danny Cevallos\n\nSome are calling for the newly-named Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, just as Attorney General Jeff Sessions did before him.\n\nThe Ethics in Government Act of 1978 directs the attorney general to create rules requiring disqualification of Justice Department employees in cases of personal, financial or political conflict of interest, or the appearance thereof. This mandate has been accomplished through regulations, one of which Sessions cited in his own recusal upon: \"Disqualification arising from personal or political relationship.\"\n\nThe regulation provides, among other things, that \"no employee shall participate in a criminal investigation\u2026if he has a personal or political relationship with (a)ny person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution.\" A \"(p)olitical relationship means a close identification with an elected official, a candidate \u2026 a political party, or a campaign organization, arising from service as a principal adviser \u2026 or a principal official \u2026\"\n\nA DOJ employee may not participate in a matter that could affect the financial interests of members of his or her household or where someone is involved with whom the employee is seeking employment or a business, contractual or other financial relationship.\n\nSessions was quick to point out in his opening statement during an appearance before the Senate that he recused himself \"not because of any asserted wrongdoing on my part during the campaign,\" but because the DOJ regulation \"required it.\"\n\nIn the case of Whitaker, parts of Section 45.2 could arguably apply. Critics might argue that Whitaker cannot oversee Mueller's investigation of President Donald Trump because of a prior political or personal relationship with Trump.\n\nReports that Whitaker has ingratiated himself with the White House through his television appearances and his position as Sessions' chief of staff could be cited as a political or personal relationship. A political relationship could be that \"close identification\" developed with the president in his capacity as Sessions' chief of staff.\n\nWhitaker might be said to have a \"personal relationship,\" which means a close and substantial connection that would be considered likely to induce partiality. There's a presumption of a \"personal relationship\" with one\u2019s father, mother, brother, sister, child and spouse. But friendships can be included, and these are evaluated on an individual basis with consideration given to the official's subjective opinion.\n\nThe challenge with claiming that Whitaker has a \"personal\" or \"political\" relationship with Trump is that many people are appointed to positions because they have curried favor with an executive. The fact that Whitaker commented on television about the Mueller investigation might indicate bias, but it's hard to say if that rises to the level of a personal or political relationship, or an improper appearance of partiality.\n\nIn the modern cable era, it might have a chilling effect if potential Justice Department appointees were disqualified for an opinion expressed on television, an op-ed column or an academic journal article. Then again, if that public statement indicates a significant enough bias, recusal could be appropriate.\n\nWhen federal courts have analyzed Section 45.2, they have mainly done so in the context of a criminal defendant seeking to disqualify a federal prosecutor, claiming, for example that the AUSA had it in for him because of some prior unpleasant interaction.\n\nDisqualifying prosecutors implicates separation of powers issues, and is a drastic measure that courts should hesitate to impose unless disqualification is necessary. Not surprisingly, courts disqualify prosecutors only in limited circumstances.\n\nOf course, federal prosecutors are hardly expected to be neutral in all things. By definition, a U.S. Attorney is an adversarial position, an advocate aligned against criminals, civil rights violators and the like. While the Supreme Court has indicated that judicial neutrality is closely guarded, prosecutors need not be as entirely neutral and detached.\n\nWhen a defendant tries to knock out an assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting him, the defendant has to raise a credible allegation of a conflict of interest or the appearance of an improper motivation. Then, a court will carefully balance judicial integrity against the government's right to prosecute. Usually, the defendant loses.\n\nEven if a court could review the application of the recusal regulations to Whitaker in this situation, it might conclude that this personal or political relationship does not warrant disqualification. Then again, normally the alleged bias is against the criminal defendant \u2014 not against the investigation itself.\n\nWhether Whitaker should recuse himself from involvement in the Mueller investigation ultimately appears to be a judgment call \u2014 one that Trump likely vetted in advance of selecting him.\n\nDanny Cevallos is an MSNBC legal analyst.

Nathan Deal, also a Republican. \"That is why effective 11:59 a.m. today, I'm stepping down as secretary of state.\"\n\nKemp holds a narrowing lead over Abrams after Tuesday's vote, but the race remains too close to call, according to NBC News. Kemp leads Abrams, 50.3 percent to 48.7 percent.\n\nKemp said Thursday that even if Abrams received \"100 percent\" of the remaining provisional ballots, he would still come out on top.\n\n\"The votes are not there for her,\" Kemp said. \"I certainly respect the hard fought race that she ran. But that's a decision she's gonna have to make. But we've run the race, it's very clear now and we're moving forward with the transition.\"\n\nAs more ballots are being counted, however, Abrams' deficit nears both the threshold required for a mandatory recount and the level needed to trigger a runoff election. Georgia requires that a candidate get more than 50 percent of the vote to be declared the winner and avoid a runoff.\n\nAbrams' campaign has maintained that there are enough outstanding ballots to force a runoff, which would be held Dec. 4. If Abrams is able to gain slightly more than 23,700 votes on Kemp, the race is pushed into a mandatory recount. If she can gain about 25,600, it is forced into a runoff.\n\nIn a Thursday news conference of its own, her campaign accused the secretary of state's office of providing inaccurate and incomplete information about how many votes are yet to be counted.\n\nCampaign lawyers announced during the press gathering that they would file a lawsuit Thursday over absentee ballots in Dougherty County.\n\nLauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams' campaign manager, said Kemp owes the people of Georgia \"an explanation\" for why accurate and complete information was not being provided.\n\n\"We need to see lists, we need to see names, we need to see counts of every vote,\" she said, later adding that the campaign would not stop pressing forward \"until we are confident that every vote has been counted.\"\n\nIn a statement released later Thursday, the campaign also said it has requested that every county preserve all documents pertaining to the election as it investigates claims from students who believe their absentee ballots were not accepted and works to obtain more information about provisional ballots.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez said he applauded Abrams \"for continuing to ensure that every vote must be counted.\"\n\nIn his role as secretary of state, Kemp oversaw Georgia's elections, something that opponents have pointed to as an inherent conflict of interest. Last month, former President Jimmy Carter, a Georgian, called on Kemp to resign.\n\nNow that he has, Kemp will not oversee a recount, if there is one. Following Kemp's announcement he would resign, Deal appointed Robyn Crittenden as the interim secretary of state. Crittenden served for three years as commissioner of the Georgia Department Human Services.\n\nThe run-up to Election Day in the battle between Abrams and Kemp was rife with controversy surrounding Kemp's oversight of his own election. Abrams and civil rights groups have accused Kemp of suppressing the vote, and federal courts have ruled against some of Kemp's pre-election measures.\n\nKemp has said he is just trying to follow the law.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, is seeking to become the first black woman elected governor in the U.S. Speaking Wednesday, she alluded to the allegations of voter suppression.\n\n\"This election has tested our faith,\" she said Wednesday. \"I'm not going to name names, but some have worked hard to take our voices away.\"\n\nThe Abrams-Kemp race is not the only prominent midterm election battle still undecided. In Florida, vote margins in close contests for governor and Senate tightened.\n\nIn Arizona, votes are still being counted in the Senate race between Republican Rep.

But they took heart that new Democratic control of the U.S. House of Representatives and several governorships could pave the way for future victories against fossil fuels and global warming.\n\nThe biggest loss came in Washington state, where a measure to tax carbon dioxide emissions lost 56 percent to 44 percent, despite backing from a broad coalition of Democratic, environmental, union and Native American groups. The measure's lopsided defeat squashed hopes that the tax would become a model for other states to raise the cost, and reduce the desirability, of fuels that produce Earth-warming greenhouse gases.\n\nThe environmental movement lost on three other ballot measures Tuesday, but there were victories, too. And Democrats are counting on a decided edge in House and gubernatorial contests to increase the pushback against President Donald Trump\u2019s support of oil, gas and coal interests.\n\n\u201cThere was more progress than not,\u201d said National Wildlife Federation President Collin O\u2019Mara. \u201cBut it\u2019s still miles to go before we sleep.\u201d\n\nThe defeats for environmentalists:\n\nArizona voters overwhelmingly defeated a measure that would have required the state to get half its power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar power by 2030. That\u2019s a fairly modest goal, in an era when some states have set 100 percent green energy goals. (California\u2019s deadline for that threshold is 2045.) But the campaign against Proposition 127, funded heavily by a major utility company, said it would force up the cost of electricity and prematurely close coal plants and the state\u2019s lone nuclear plant.\n\nColorado voted 57 percent to 43 percent to reject rules that would have pushed oil and gas drilling substantially farther from homes, businesses, streams and rivers. The \u201cfracking setbacks\u201d measure might have blocked new wells on as much as 95 percent of the land in fossil fuel-rich counties. A major campaign by the industry said it would cost the state jobs and slow the booming economy.\n\nAlaska\u2019s \u201cStand for Salmon\u201d initiative would have toughened the review of mining, oil and other development to protect the state\u2019s favorite game fish. But Measure 1 lost 64 percent to 36 percent. Proponents said the habitat protection would have had the added benefit of controlling greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe victories:\n\nNevada voters approved a measure much like the one Arizona rejected, requiring the state to get 50 percent of its electricity from green sources by 2030. Question 6 got more than 59 percent of the vote, though the measure must be approved again in 2020 to take effect. That double-approval process can be problematic, as proven on Tuesday when the state\u2019s voters reversed their verdict of two years ago and rejected a measure that would have eliminated the monopoly for the state\u2019s lone electric utility, NV Energy.\n\nGeorgia passed Amendment 1, to put 90 percent of sales taxes on sporting goods toward conservation efforts. The estimated $200 million collected over a decade would help create parks and protect wildlife habitat.\n\nIn a phone call Wednesday, a half dozen environmental groups called the midterm election a success, mostly because of the increased focus they expect their issues to get from a House that will now be controlled by Democrats.\n\nThey expect the Democrats to hold hearings and potentially subpoena evidence on Trump administration policies \u2014 particularly at the Interior Department, Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 that have encouraged the burning of coal, oil and gas.\n\n\u201cWe need intensive oversight,\u201d said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cWe have seen the Trump administration try to repeal [President Barack Obama\u2019s] Clean Power Plan, try to repeal the clean car rules... So we need intense oversight of the executive actions at Interior, EPA and other places.\u201d\n\nThe green organizations also said they hoped that Congress moves ahead with long-stalled plans to build new infrastructure and that Democrats insist the work include expansion of forests and clean energy facilities. \u201cAny infrastructure package could have a lot of clean energy attached to it. That would have bipartisan legs,\u201d said the wildlife federation\u2019s O\u2019Mara.\n\nAdvocates also had high hopes for continued progress on the state and local level. Democrats won seven governor\u2019s races in states where Republicans had been in power, while Republicans gained control only in Alaska. And some Republican elected governors \u2014 like Charlie Baker in Massachusetts and Larry Hogan in Maryland \u2014 support policies to combat climate change. Baker in August signed a $2.4 billion package of global warming adaptation measures, and Hogan said Maryland would join states supporting the Paris Climate Accord, which Trump said the U.S. would abandon.\n\nRepublican Gov. Charlie Baker acknowledges applause from supporters on election night in Boston. Winslow Townson / AP\n\nThe election results will accelerate action in the states, said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Brune said that could mean the shutdown of more coal-fired power plants and tougher regulation of the oil, gas and coal industries. \u201cGovernors play a big role in all that,\u201d Brune said.\n\nThe environmental leaders said little about the loss of the Washington carbon tax. Two years ago, the last time Washington voted on a carbon tax, proponents tried to lure conservatives and moderates by promising to give the money back to taxpayers by cutting sales and other taxes. This time, they said they would spend the money on environmental cleanup measures. Neither approach worked.\n\nA supporter of the ballot campaign said that, despite the loss, polls still showed that Washingtonians \u201cagree that we must address global warming by weaning our state off of fossil fuels.\u201d Now that campaign will turn to getting 100 percent of the state\u2019s electricity from green sources and \u201celectrifying\u201d cars and trucks, the No. 1 source of global warming pollution, said Bruce Speight, director of Environment Washington, an environmental research and advocacy group.\n\nThe head of a pro-fossil fuel group praised voters for rejecting the state ballot measures. Robert Dillon of the American Council for Capital Formation acknowledged in a statement that the Democratic House victories could slow permitting of fossil fuel projects.\n\nBut at the state level, he found cause for optimism below the governor\u2019s mansions in the office of attorney general, where four states flipped from Democrat to Republican.

He used a .45 caliber Glock handgun in Wednesday's shooting.\n\nWhen Estron heard a pause in gunfire, he assessed the shooter must be reloading his gun, and took the opportunity to throw barstools at the windows in an effort to escape.\n\nOthers at the bar weren't as clear on what the sound was when the gunman came in and started shooting. And smoke permeating the inside of the popular hangout spot added to the confusion.\n\n\"You start hearing what almost sounds like firecrackers going off because somebody came in through the front door and just started shooting people the second he walked in,\" said Todd Stratton.\n\n\"I didn't really fully recognize that like it's an actual shooting, you know because you are in shock. You're trying to register the situation,\" Stratton said.\n\nOnce those who were able to escape spilled into the parking lot, the priority was finding their friends.\n\nSarah Rose DeSon was celebrating her friend's birthday when she heard the shots. She tried to find safety under a table, but there were too many people there, and \"by the grace of God I got to the front door.\"\n\nWhen she got outside and into a friend's car, she circled the parking lot in an effort to find another friend she had separated from.\n\n\"We weren\u2019t going to leave our friend,\" she said, adding that she was found safe hiding in bushes.\n\nTeylor Whittler said she came to Borderline with 10 other people. \"We still don\u2019t know where two of them are.

It's heartbreaking for me,\" Wennerstrom said.\n\n\"It's a horrific scene in there,\" said Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean during a news conference in the bar's parking lot. \"There's blood everywhere.\"\n\nAmong those killed was responding Ventura County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year police veteran with a wife and son who was looking to retire in the next year.\n\nHelus, 54, arrived at the scene alongside a colleague from the California Highway Patrol within three minutes of reports of shots being fired at around 11:20 p.m. (2:20 a.m. ET Thursday), according to Dean.\n\nAbout 10 to 12 other people were injured, according to police.\n\n\u201cThere were just bodies on top of bodies, men crying and women screaming,\u201d said Matthew Curry, 20, who was at the bar Wednesday night.\n\nHe said he believes a man his friend had introduced him to before the shooter walked in was killed. \u201cHe was some guy I just met \u2026 and then he was gone,\" Curry said.\n\nMany who were at Borderline Bar, especially popular with college students on Wednesday nights, described it as a place where you run into friends you haven't seen in a while, along with people you see there every week.\n\nHolden Harrah, 20, said he saw the woman working the front desk get shot. He assumes she was killed. \"My eyes were directly on the target,\u201d Harrah said. \"Unfortunately I had to see a friend die.\"\n\nHarrah said the bar is a place where students from nearby colleges, including California Lutheran University, Moorpark and Pepperdine University, come to catch up. He said he's made visits there part of his routine for half a year now.\n\n\"The reason why I come, I like running into people I haven\u2019t seen in a very long time,\" said the student. \u201cIt was a good night tonight. It hasn\u2019t been packed recently, but tonight there was a good amount of people.\u201d\n\n\"I\u2019m very very lucky to be here. Very very lucky to be on my two feet,\" Harrah added.\n\nHe said he never expected such violence in his community. Thousand Oaks was ranked the third-safest city in the United States this year, according to the data analysis website Niche.\n\n\"Thousand Oaks, I like to say it\u2019s our safe-haven because this type of stuff doesn\u2019t happen, like ever,\" Harrah said. \"No one would ever think this would happen here, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m in shock.\"\n\nRichie Duchon reported from Thousand Oaks, California.

Consider:\n\nHe fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replaced him with Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, who has been critical of the Mueller probe: \u201cBefore Whitaker came to the Justice Department in 2017, he wrote an op-ed for CNN that said Mueller's investigation was \u2018going too far.\u2019 He supported Trump's claim that the probe would be crossing a red line if it branched into the finances of Trump and his family. As a legal commentator on CNN, Whitaker also said that Sessions could be replaced with someone who would reduce Mueller's budget,\u201d NBC\u2019s Julia Ainsley writes.\n\nHe threatened to investigate Democrats if they investigate him: \u201cIf that happens [Democrats using subpoenas to get his tax returns and other items], then we\u2019re going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt, and I would blame them, because they now are going to be coming up with policy,\u201d Trump said at his news conference yesterday.\n\nHis White House revoked the \u201chard pass\u201d of CNN\u2019s White House correspondent: CNN's Jim Acosta \u201ctweeted Wednesday night that he was denied access when he tried to enter the White House \u2026 press secretary Sarah Sanders later issued a statement that said the reporter's \u2018hard pass\u2019 was suspended as a result of his attempt to keep control of a microphone during Wednesday's news conference with the president,\u201d per NBC News. (In fact, here is the video of a White House intern trying to take away the microphone from Acosta.)\n\nAnd he accused an African-American reporter of asking a \u201cracist\u201d question when she asked him if he was emboldening white nationalists by referring to himself as a nationalist: \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question ... Why do I have among the highest poll numbers with African-Americans? I mean, why do I have my highest poll numbers? That\u2019s such a racist question.\u201d (In fact, the most recent NBC/WSJ poll showed that just 14 percent of likely African-American voters approve of Trump\u2019s job.)\n\nAnother tragic mass shooting \u2014 this time in California\n\nNBC News: \u201cTwelve people including a police officer were killed by a gunman at a crowded bar in Thousand Oaks, California, late Wednesday, officials said. Several hundred people were inside the venue, which was hosting a \u2018college country night\u2019 for students, police said. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean described the incident at the Borderline Bar and Grill as a \u2018tragic, tragic situation.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gunman apparently was not carrying any form of identification and it will take time to take his fingerprints and run them through databases, local and federal officials said. The gunman was described as a white male, armed with a single handgun, a law enforcement source said.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how AZ-SEN is going to play out\n\nNBC's Vaughn Hillyard on the votes that still have to be counted in the very close Martha McSally-vs.-Kyrsten Sinema race for Arizona Senate: \u201cThere are an estimated 652,400 uncounted ballots in Arizona. These are nearly all early ballots that have yet to be counted \u2014 there are a few thousand provisional ballots.\u201d\n\nMore from Hillyard: \u201cMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes has told NBC News that Maricopa County has 492,400 ballots that must still be counted. We will know the results of some of these on Thursday at 7:00 pm ET when the county updates its results. Thursday is expected to provide the results of a significant portion of these votes, but the county says it will incrementally release the results over nine or 10 days. To note: This should give us a pretty good idea if Sinema stands a shot to make up the present 0.9 percent deficit (15,908 votes) she currently has.\n\nAlso: \u201cThere are roughly 160,000 votes outside of Maricopa County that still need to be counted. We say roughly because some of the counties have not reported how many ballots they actually have, and it is tough to project these turnout figures based on past elections compared to what we saw yesterday. But for this process, these numbers are based off of voter turnout projections. The Arizona Republic says Pima County is reporting it has 70,000 to 80,000 uncounted early ballots, plus 18,000 uncounted provisional ballots (currently: Sinema=55.2 percent; McSally=42.8 percent). This is a huge number for Pima County.\u201d\n\nBottom line: This race is far, far from over.\n\nFL-SEN goes to a recount\n\n\u201cThe razor-thin Florida Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and the state\u2019s Republican Gov. Rick Scott is headed to a recount, Nelson\u2019s campaign announced Wednesday morning,\u201d per Politico. \u201cWith more than 8 million votes cast, the two candidates are separated by fewer than 35,000 votes, with Scott holding the slim lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlorida\u2019s 67 counties now must recheck their tallies, a process they initially have until noon on Nov. 10 to complete. In addition, Nelson\u2019s campaign is sending monitors to every county across the state.

As recent polling showed, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis and his running mate, Jeannette Nu\u00f1ez, won 66 percent of the vote in the predominantly Cuban precincts located in the suburbs of western Miami-Dade and Hialeah. DeSantis' 33-percentage point advantage among Cubans over Democrat Andrew Gillum was a 16-point improvement for Republicans from Donald Trump's 57 to 40 percent lead over Hillary Clinton and a key to his success. Had DeSantis merely mirrored Trump's 2016 Cuban performance, the Democrats' lead in Miami-Dade County would have widened by approximately 78,000 votes and left DeSantis with a 0.4 percent statewide deficit.\u201d\n\nThe uncalled House races (12)\n\nCA-10\n\n-- (CA-25) (GOP Rep.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX \u2014 Republicans filed a lawsuit Wednesday night to challenge the way some Arizona counties count mail-in ballots as election officials began to slowly tally more than 600,000 outstanding votes in the narrow U.S. Senate race \u2014 a task that could take days.\n\nRepublican Rep. Martha McSally and Democratic Rep. Kyrstin Sinema were separated by a small fraction of the 1.7 million tabulated votes.\n\nAbout 75 percent of Arizona voters cast ballots by mail, but those ballots have to go through the laborious signature confirmation process, and only then can be opened and tabulated. If county recorders have issues verifying signatures they are allowed to ask voters to verify their identity.\n\nThe suit filed Wednesday by four county Republican parties alleges that the state's 15 county recorders don't follow a uniform standard for allowing voters to adjust problems with their mail-in ballots, and that two counties improperly allow those fixes after Election Day.\n\nThe GOP complained about the issue before Election Day and threatened to sue. Democrats alleged it was attempted voter suppression and that recorders have followed the same procedures for years with no issues. Republicans said it was about following the law and having a timely ballot count.\n\nThe sluggish count is a perennial issue for Arizona, but has rarely received such a high level of attention because the GOP-leaning state generally has had few nationally-watched nail-biting contests.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that signature verification must stop when polls close, and seeks an injunction to stop the counting of such ballots that have been verified after then. It's unclear how many of these votes still remain outstanding, but the suit singles out the state's two biggest urban counties, the center of support for Sinema. It says the two counties allow voters to help clear up signature problems up to five days after the election.\n\nDemocrats believe the uncounted urban ballots dropped off shortly before Election Day favors Sinema.\n\nThe lawsuit is scheduled to be heard Friday, after the next release late Thursday of tallied ballots.\n\nIt's one window into the complexities of mail ballots and the so-called \"late earlies\" that arrive just before Election Day and regularly gum up the state's vote counting system.\n\nThis election featured heavy statewide turnout of about 60 percent, more in line with a presidential election than a midterm \u2014 part of the reason county registrars were overloaded with uncounted ballots.\n\nOne candidate familiar with the long wait is McSally. It took The Associated Press 12 days to name her as the loser of her first congressional race in 2012 because the margin was so narrow and vote counting was slow. McSally's second and successful bid for the seat ended with a recount in December of 2014, more than one month after the election.\n\nMcSally tweeted early Wednesday that she was going \"to bed with a lead of over 14,000 votes.\"\n\nShe added: \"We're confident tomorrow will bring more good news.\"\n\nSinema tweeted that the \"race is about you and we're going to make sure your vote is counted. There are a lot of outstanding ballots \u2014 especially those mailed-in \u2014 and a lot of reasons to feel good!\"\n\nThe cliffhanger Senate race comes in what's otherwise shaping up to be another banner Arizona year for Republicans. The GOP has won every statewide race in Arizona over the past decade, and Democrats were hoping Sinema could break that streak.\n\nRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey was easily re-elected over a challenge from Democrat David Garcia, a professor. The GOP notched victories in the attorney general, treasurer and secretary of state races as well.\n\nThe picture was brighter for the state's Democrats in Congress, where Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick was elected to the Tucson-area swing district seat vacated by McSally and Democrats held all their other four seats, giving them a majority of the state's nine-member U.S. House delegation.\n\nThe Senate contest was the marquee race, featuring two champion fundraisers who are no strangers to tight races. They are battling over the seat vacated by Sen.

Now, with voters giving Democrats control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retaining their Senate majority, fund managers can take opposite sides of various policy bets.\n\nThese might include whether financials will benefit from deregulation even with stricter House oversight, if healthcare will face more policy proposals aimed at restraining costs, and whether military spending will get caught in a tussle between the two parties.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was willing to work with Democrats on some policy priorities.\n\nIssues that could gather bipartisan support include a package to improve infrastructure, protections against prescription drug price increases and a push to rebalance trade with China.\n\nThe October sell-off was driven by macroeconomic concerns tied to the Federal Reserve, tariffs, and inflation \u2014 and hit active fund managers badly. Large-cap active mutual fund managers posted their worst results versus their benchmark since September 2011, according to Bank of America data.\n\nMore conflict in policy decisions could mean those factors drive stocks more than macroeconomic developments.\n\nFor instance, investors are bidding up sand and gravel suppliers Martin Marietta Materials and Vulcan Materials on the hope that bipartisan support for infrastructure spending can move forward. But ValueWorks founder Charles Lemonides said he is trimming his stake in the stocks as they begin to reflect too much optimism.\n\n\"We think there is a lot of opportunity for people who are willing to do the hard work of investing, which is find individual investments that make sense,\" said Lemonides.\n\nMacro forces might be less relevant than assumed in the short run. The meeting expected at the end of the month between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could yield hopeful words but no firm commitments to resolve trade issues.\n\nThe Federal Reserve could raise rates as expected in December while striking a tone that keeps markets calm. So long as markets focus on more parochial issues instead of trade and monetary policy the implications for stocks could be positive going into next year, investors said.\n\nPolicymakers, even those in the same party, could be so at odds that they make no policy changes. Republicans who have controlled the White House and Congress since January 2017 surprised investors by failing to replace the Affordable Care Act even though it was a campaign promise.\n\nThat makes oddsmaking hard now on a range of issues, from repealing a medical device tax to passing a budget or loosening regulations on banks.

Larry Hogan.\n\nOther losing progressives included congressional hopefuls like Randy \"Ironstache\" Bryce, who ran for the Wisconsin seat being vacated by retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, and both progressive insurgents who won upset victories in primaries earlier this year against Democratic establishment-backed candidates, Kara Eastman in Nebraska and Dana Balter in New York.\n\nAnd Elizabeth Warren protege Katie Porter, a progressive who came out on top in a crowded primary in southern California, is trailing in a too-close-to-call House race, while some candidates who beat progressive-backed candidates in Democratic primaries in places like Kansas and Texas won their races.\n\nSean McElwee, the progressive activist who popularized the call to \"abolish ICE,\" acknowledged that Democrats' biggest successes this cycle came in primaries in safe blue seats, where rising stars like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts ousted longtime Democratic incumbents and cruised to victories Tuesday.\n\n\"We should really take seriously the idea that the path forward is contesting for power in (primaries in) the deeper bluer seats,\" said McElwee, who runs the think tank Data for Progress, adding that approach would help progressives form a bulwark in Congress to press their agenda.\n\nModerates can hardly claim to have found a sure-fire recipe for success either after Tuesday night, however.\n\nRep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, D-Texas, who supported impeaching President Donald Trump, came within three percentage points of winning a Senate seat in Texas, which hasn't sent a Democrat to the upper chamber in 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, incumbent Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who both tacked aggressively to the center, lost by wider margins in friendlier states. And Tennessee Democratic Senate challenger Phil Bredesen, who said he would have voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, got trounced by 11 percentage points to an unpopular opponent.\n\nOverall, the results offer mixed signals for Democrats, providing just enough evidence for both sides to continue their low-boil civil war.\n\nAnd they wasted no time doing so.\n\n\"They flipped exactly zero House seats. Zero point zero,\" said Matt Bennett, a senior vice president of the centrist Democratic thank tank Third Way, referring to two prominent progressive groups that emerged from Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential bid \u2014 Our Revolution and Justice Democrats.\n\nOur Revolution did not dispute that figure. Spokesperson Diane May said the group still won at least 67 races overall and noted that two of its endorsed candidates, J.D. Scholten, who challenged Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, and Liuba Grechen Shirley, who took on Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., came \"very close to unseating incumbents.\"\n\nOn the other side, according to the moderate New Democrat Coalition, which cast a wider net in its endorsements, candidates in 23 of the roughly 29 seats Democrats have netted so far were backed by the group.\n\nStill, the incoming class of freshmen Democrats in Congress is likely more liberal than any recent one as the party's center of gravity has shifted decisively to the left.\n\n\"We saw red-state (Democratic) senators sadly go down to dramatic defeat after hedging on economic populist and racial justice issues \u2014 seeming uncomfortable in their own political skin. Yet progressive senators Sherrod Brown and Tammy Baldwin both won re-election by large margins in Trump states by keeping it real,\" said Adam Green, the co-founder of the group Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nWhen asked to name one new winning candidate that best demonstrates the left's theory of the case, Green paused and said, \"That's a good question.\" He then pointed to data his group compiled that shows the \"totality of the actual Democrats who just got elected\" embraced progressive ideas.\n\nThe center of gravity in the party may have shifted left, but whether candidates actually prioritized progressive litmus test issues like Medicare for All in the general election is less clear.\n\nDemocrats did find unity on once-divisive issues like abortion rights. Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, cited as an example Jacky Rosen, who won a Nevada Senate seat Tuesday by ousting Republican incumbent Dean Heller.\n\n\"I don't think anybody thinks of Jacky as a foaming-at-the-mouth liberal, she just holds the values of reproductive freedom, gun safety and expanding access to healthcare and made her case to the people of Nevada in an authentic way,\" Hogue said.\n\nRep.

Turns out the majority of us \u2014 64 percent \u2014 regret our spending on short-term pleasures, including food, clothing, new cars, tech gadgets and vacations, according to a new study by Schwab.\n\nSpecifically, we wish we\u2019d managed our spending better so that we could have put more money away for retirement. In fact, not having enough money for a comfortable retirement was the top source of money stress for those surveyed. With all of that rear-view mirror research, the question is: Why don\u2019t we just stop? The answer, unfortunately, is complicated.\n\nA tight budget seems to bring about more impulse spending.\n\nIt comes down to a failure to delay gratification and an inclination towards impulsivity, which occurs in all humans \u2014 but particularly (and ironically) among those whose budgets are already stretched thin, says psychiatrist Mark Tobak, MD, and author of Anyone Can Be Rich! A Psychiatrist Provides the Mental Tools to Build Your Wealth. A recent study by Bankrate showed that the lowest earning Americans (who earn less than $30,000 a year) spend 13 percent of their income on restaurant food, prepared drinks and lottery tickets \u2014 a higher percentage than any other income bracket.\n\nPeople who live on tight budgets are going to \u201cgrasp at any pleasure they can find, in the hope of securing something for themselves in an unkind world,\u201d Tobak says. Moreover, although you\u2019d think feeling somewhat desperate financially would make people hoard cash, the reaction is often the opposite. \u201cWith greater desperation comes a desire to take greater risk, and a lottery ticket is a greater risk than a savings account,\u201d he says.\n\nBoredom \u2014 or the search for excitement \u2014 does the same.\n\nWhich is not to say that even people with plenty of money don\u2019t play the powerball. \u201cWe\u2019re all after that dopamine rush that comes from taking risks and spending money,\u201d Toback says. \u201cEven if you lose, you have all that excitement building up to the moment you win. Not everyone gambling in Vegas is poor. You have high rollers who drop millions.\u201d\n\nAnd the lottery isn\u2019t the only win we\u2019re after. Social media has also lured many of us down the path of spending money, enticing us to spend for the quick thrill of a \u201clike\u201d that comes when we post vacation pictures or snaps of our latest fashion acquisition. A recent Social Savings Survey from Ally Bank showed that 74 percent of millennials say social media influences their shopping. \u201cThis lavish social media lifestyle is influencing our spending and consumption behavior whether we realize it or not. The need to \u2018keep up with the Joneses\u2019 is a perpetual battle with one\u2019s finances,\u201d says Diane Morais, president of Consumer & Commercial Banking Products for Ally Bank. From a psychological standpoint, social media has \u201cretrained\u201d our brains to be less inclined to seek long-term accomplishments as pleasure. We\u2019ve grown so accustomed to the quick highs of positive online interactions, that the satisfied feeling we get when we save money may pale in comparison.\n\nIf we\u2019re so worried, why don\u2019t we change?\n\nIn some cases, we may not know better. If you never learned how to manage money at home with your parents, and you never learned it in school, the idea of saving money can be something that never clicks. We may also doubt our abilities to make a meaningful difference on a modest budget.\n\n\"Participants in the Schwab study felt like $25 here or there wouldn\u2019t make a difference in the long run,\u201d says Schwab\u2019s Catherine Golladay Senior Vice President of 401(k) Participant Services and Administration. \u201cBut time is your most valuable asset. Putting even small amounts of money away over time can really add up, and the earlier you do it, the more you\u2019ll benefit from compound interest.\u201d\n\nMaking a conscious shift\n\nThe key to getting ahead of our impulses seems to lie in a) recognizing them and b) planning for them. \u201cWe really try to focus our messages on a theme of money-mindfulness, and how important it is to understand the proper balance between saving, spending and budgeting,\u201d says Morais.\n\nFirst, turn off your social media if that\u2019s what gets you to spend impulsively. Or make a deal with yourself that there will be no more online shopping after the first glass of wine. And if you do get to the point of purchase, enforce a pause while you ask yourself these questions, says Morais: Am I on track with my savings goals or will this expenditure derail my plans? Do I really need, and more importantly can I easily afford, this purchase? Am I feeling impulsive? Have I really thought this through?\n\nThen turn your focus to automating savings \u2014 not just into 401(k) and other retirement accounts but into 529s, HSAs and savings accounts for other goals \u2014 as a way to make an end-run around our impulses. If you save first, you can spend knowing you\u2019re already accomplishing your goals (as long as that spending doesn\u2019t drag you into debt.)\n\nFinally, recognize that the sort of stuff we buy on impulse isn\u2019t the only way to use money to bring us joy. Watching your bank account or retirement savings grow can be a gratifying experience, as can unlocking the front door to your new home.\n\nWith Kathryn Tuggle\n\nHOW TO SAVE MORE MONEY\n\nWant more tips like these?

So pervasive that no one seems accountable for it.\n\nShortly after Scott Paul Beierle opened fire at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, Florida, killing two women and wounding four others, police say the motive remains unclear. \u201cInvestigators are working around the clock to\u2026gain clarity as to why this senseless act occurred,\u201d the City of Tallahassee Police Department wrote in a Facebook statement a day after the attack.\n\nWhile, legally, motivation for this specific incident has yet to be determined, the cause couldn\u2019t be clearer, given the shooter\u2019s social media trail and his arrest record.\n\nWhile, legally, motivation for this specific incident has yet to be determined, the cause couldn\u2019t be clearer.\n\nJust as clear is how a culture of permissibility allowed Beierle\u2019s anger at women to grow unfettered over the years, from a series of belligerent YouTube videos filled with sexist and racist diatribes to a criminal record of physically assaulting women. He targeted a predominately female space \u2014 nearly three-quarters of yoga practitioners in the U.S. are women \u2014 reportedly posing as a customer before opening fire.\n\nIt is a culture that condones violence against women. It is a culture that conflates domination with freedom. It is a culture that espouses that men\u2019s \u201crights\u201d include direct and unfettered access to women\u2019s bodies \u2014 consent is an obstacle to overcome. \u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy,\u201d said the man sitting in Oval Office, the person who American citizens elected to serve as leader the of the free world. \u201cYou can do anything you want.\u201d\n\nWhen violence against women is culturally permissible, it means not only that this violence is met with an air of indifference \u2014 the turning of a cheek, or a shushing of conversation at a family dinner\u2014 it also means that this violence is tacitly encouraged through the failure to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions. Thus, violence against women becomes normal, or just what happens when women get out of line.\n\nThere have been countless men like Scott Paul Beierle. We just don\u2019t remember them because there have just been too many to count. \u201cCommon\u201d is, perhaps, the most devastating word that describes both the frequency and seeming mundanity of violence against women.\n\nIn just the past year or so, the #MeToo movement has cracked open this insidious culture: From Roger Ailes to Harvey Weinstein, Andy Rubin to Les Moonves, men violate women with impunity and get away with it. Sometimes, as in the case of former Google exec Rubin, they actually get paid after they are caught.\n\nWhen the system of male supremacy \u2014 what we horrible feminists call the patriarchy \u2014 is exposed, those within the system work overtime to identify the exposed element as an outlier or a lone wolf. All the while fanatical women haters fester online, stroking their own pathology, and transforming the lone wolf into a hero.\n\nFor men like Scott Beierle, murderer Elliot Rodger has become that hero. In 2014, Rodger killed six women and injured 14 others in a homicidal rampage directed specifically toward women, who he blamed for his own sexual insecurities. \u201cFor the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty,\u201d Rodger said in his final YouTube video, \u201cI\u2019ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men, but never to me.\u201d Notice the projection in the inverted syntax: \u201cI\u2019ve been forced to endure.\u201d Rodger held women accountable for his emotional instability. The language places him in a position of powerlessness \u2014 to reassert his supremacy, to exact his revenge, he killed the people who he attributed with his emasculation: women.\n\n\u201c[N]o one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or disdainful, than a man anxious about his own virility,\u201d wrote Simone de Beauvoir about the misogynist consequences of the male inferiority complex in \u201cThe Second Sex.\u201d\n\nAnd Beierle was anxious. And angry. Ample proof of this exists in his series of YouTube videos in which he condemns \u201cthe American whore\u201d and calls out the \u201ctreachery\u201d of the \u201cpit of vipers\u201d who shirked his advances. In explaining the origins of his hatred of women in a video titled, \u201cThe Rebirth of my Misogyny,\u201d Beirele concludes his invective with these foreboding words: \u201cI believe in karma. I believe in what comes around goes around. And those that engage in treachery will ultimately be the victims of it. Hopefully there\u2019s been justice in some comparable regard that they\u2019ve been the recipients of\u2026.\u201d\n\nIn his videos, Beierle speaks repeatedly of women\u2019s treachery and betrayal \u2014 synonyms used to paint women as the abusers and himself as the victim. This paradigm shift, whereby the abuser positions himself as the abused, is a frequently employed patriarchal strategy of inversion. Indeed, it is one we witnessed just last month in Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, whereby Kavanaugh, in his mind and in the minds of other men (like Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham), was the \"victim\u201d of character assassination.\n\n\u201cBullies often conceptualize themselves as being under attack when they are the ones originating the pain,\u201d Sarah Schulman writes in her book \u201cConflict is Not Abuse,\u201d about how abusers externalize and project their trauma as a way to reinforce their supremacy. When abusers feel their dominance being threatened, or questioned, they \u201cinvok[e] the language of abuse\u201d in order to avoid responsibility for their abusive actions.\n\nFrom women being blamed for being raped to black people being blamed for police killing them, the responsibility for the act of violence is rarely shouldered by the person who commits the act itself.\n\nThis disavowal of responsibility enacted through displacement and projection is abundantly apparent in our culture, especially when it comes to violence against women and minorities. From women being blamed for being raped to black people being blamed for police killing them, the responsibility for the act of violence is rarely shouldered by the person who commits the act itself. This abdication of responsibility is how white male supremacy remains in power.\n\nYet we don\u2019t see the violence exacted by those in power because it exists in the very structures of society. This violence has been naturalized, neutralized in a way that renders it invisible, woven into the very fabric of our society. Those in power maintain their moral authority by convincing society that they are never the originators of violence. Instead, capitalizing upon bigoted opinions of women and minorities, they conveniently attribute violence to those people they abuse.\n\nIt is clear that within this mindset, Beierle believed himself to be a man betrayed by women. Like all misogynists, he felt born with an inalienable right to women\u2019s bodies. This right is translated into the language of expectation that Beierle used in his videos; language similarly found in Rodger\u2019s last YouTube video, where he talks about the trials he has \u201cbeen forced to endure.\u201d Beierle\u2019s betrayal amounts to women\u2019s autonomy \u2014 their refusal to consent to this man\u2019s unwanted advances. So consumed by his ego, by the presumption of what was rightly his, he lacked the critical introspection and self-reflection to see the boundaries between his own body and women\u2019s bodies. For those in power, boundaries do not exist that they themselves do not construct. Everything is theirs, and they are in everything.\n\nMisogyny kills. More than 1,800 women were murdered by men in 2016. Men who, more often than not used guns as their murder weapons (like the man who killed more than 10 people Wednesday night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California.) That this is a statistic of seeming inconsequence to our political leaders points to how little significance is given to addressing misogyny in our society. So does the fact that Congress has not yet renewed the Violence Against Women Act, or the fact that at least two men accused of sexual assault sit on the highest court of justice in the land, or the fact that a man accused of both sexual assault and domestic violence currently serves as president of the United States.\n\nThe police continue their investigation in Florida, but Beierle\u2019s motive is already glaringly obvious. This is proof, at the very least, that there is no end in sight to a culture of permissibility that nurtures the hatred of women.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

As recently as April, he said, deputies were called to his house after reports of a disturbance, and they found Long to be \"somewhat irate,\" and \"acting a little irrationally.\"\n\nThere was some discussion about whether Long might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Dean added. But ultimately Long was assessed by a mental health specialist who cleared him and didn't feel he was eligible to be taken in for involuntary psychiatric evaluation.\n\nDean said Long was also the victim of an assault at a bar in 2015, the sheriff said.\n\nThe weapon Long used in Wednesday night's shooting was a legally purchased Glock 21 with an extended magazine, Dean said. Long, who officials had earlier described as a heavily tattooed white man, did not appear to be carrying a driver's license or any other form of IDs, Dean said earlier on \"Today.\"\n\nSergeant 'died a hero'\n\nThe slain police officer was identified as Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran of the department with a wife and son who was looking to retire in the next year.\n\n\"He was hard-working, he was totally committed, he gave his all and, tonight, as I told his wife, he died a hero,\" an emotional Dean said. \"He gave his life to save other people.\"\n\nHelus, 54, spoke to his wife by phone just before he went inside the bar, telling her, \"I gotta go, I love you, call you later,\" according to Dean.\n\nPresident Donald Trump sent two tweets paying tributes to the authorities and victims. He praised the \"great bravery shown by police\" and said, \"God bless all of the victims and families of the victims.\"\n\nAs Helus' body was carried by hearse from Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks to a coroner's facility in the city of Ventura, residents lined the highway and many saluted the passing motorcade.\n\nMeanwhile, the grieving father of 22-year-old victim, Cody Coffman, was mourning his slain son.\n\n\"I talked to him last night before he headed out the door,\" a weeping Jason Coffman told reporters. \"First thing I said was please don't drink and drive. Last thing I said was, 'Son, I love you.' That was the last thing I said.\"\n\nThen, breaking down, Jason Coffman said, \"Oh my God.\"\n\nThe first reports of shots being fired occurred around 11:20 p.m. Wednesday (2:20 a.m. Thursday ET), police said.\n\nThree minutes later, Helus arrived at the bar with a California Highway Patrol officer, Dean said. Hearing more gunfire, Helus raced inside and \"was struck multiple times with gunfire,\" Dean said.\n\nThe patrolman was able to drag Helus out of the line of fire, but he died in the hospital hours later, the sheriff said.\n\nA SWAT team, FBI and others officers arrived soon after. When they entered the bar they found it littered with bodies, shooting survivors huddling in terror, and others desperately trying to get out.\n\n\"They found people hiding in restrooms, people hiding in attics,\" Dean said. Other witnesses described people using bar stools to break windows and escape.\n\nSeveral witnesses reported seeing what they described as smoke bombs going off inside, although police could not confirm that.\n\nSix off-duty, unarmed police officers from various agencies were at the bar when the shooting began, according to Dean.\n\n\"I\u2019ve already spoken to a parent who said, 'They stood in front of my daughter,'\" he said. \"It was amazing.\"\n\nPeople comfort each other near the scene of Wednesday's mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California. Mark J. Terrill / AP\n\nTen to 12 people suffered injuries of varying severity, with others with more minor wounds escaping and taking themselves to the hospital, Dean added.\n\nThe Los Robles Regional Medical Center confirmed later that 10 of the 11 victims they saw were treated for gunshot wounds and lacerations and released. None were admitted and the only patient who did not go home was Helus.\n\nPepperdine University, in nearby Malibu, said that some of its students were believed to have been at the bar and that it was working \"to identify and provide support to those students.\"\n\nThousand Oaks was ranked the third-safest city in the United States this year, according to the data analysis website Niche.\n\n\"I've been a cop for 41 years,\" Dean said. \"But I've learned it doesn't matter what community you're in, it doesn\u2019t matter how safe your community is. It can happen anywhere.\"\n\nSurvivors like John Hedge described in cinematic detail what it was like when the shooting erupted.\n\n\"I was actually about to leave when you start hearing pop, pop, pop. It sounded like fireworks or something,\" he told NBC News. \"My stepdad dove and took cover and yelled at me, 'John, hit the deck! Hide!' So I get down. And the gunman started opening fire on the cashiers, the people working the cash register on the front desk.\"", "Big Question: What happens when there is no one left to tell the president no? 02:39", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Doha Madani\n\nA national student organization on Wednesday claimed that the University of California Los Angeles is attempting to use trademark law to chill the free speech rights of students.\n\nThe university sent a cease-and-desist letter on October 31 to the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) over a promotional flyer the organization used to advertise its national conference, which will be held at the school beginning on November 16.\n\nThe flyer included a bear wearing a keffiyeh scarf reaching up toward a kite colored to resemble the Palestinian flag and three doves.\n\nUCLA, a public university, demanded in its letter that the organization not use renditions of the Bruin Bear, its mascot, in association with the Palestinian-flag kite, which some interpret as an endorsement of violence against Israel.\n\n\"A review of your website discloses use of the 'UCLA' name, and is an attempt to associate NSJP with the mascot of the Bruin Bear in a logo/digital poster for the national conference,\" the letter states. \"Taken as a whole, theses uses claim, suggest, or imply an affiliation with or an endorsement by UCLA of NSJP and/or its national conference, which is simply incorrect.\"\n\nThe original artwork for the National Students of Justice in Palestine Conference include the words \"UCLA 2018\" in large font along the bottom. Courtesy ACLU of Southern California\n\nNSJP, which has a student chapter at the school, called UCLA's commentary on its design a \"racist and gross mischaracterization\" of the kite. The group said the kite is a symbol of freedom for Palestinians and a common past time for children in Gaza. Kites have also been utilized with balloons by Hamas to send incendiary and explosive devices into Israel.\n\nNSJP also denied using the specific UCLA Bruin Bear in its artwork.\n\n\"In accordance with our yearly practice, we adopted a region-specific design for our 2018 conference,\" the group said in a statement Wednesday. \"We chose to honor years of West Coast advocacy efforts calling for respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe grizzly bear was designated California's state animal in 1953 and is prominently displayed on its state flag.\n\nIntellectual property expert Michael N. Cohen, owner of Cohen IP Law Group, told NBC News on Wednesday that the legal standard for trademark infringement is the likelihood of confusion in the mind of the consumer. And use of the university's name is restricted so that it won't imply the school is affiliated with, or is endorsed, favored, or supported by any groups without permission.\n\n\"So even if the [images] \u2014 if you do a side-by-side analysis \u2014 look different the true question is if it will cause confusion with the mind of consumers in the regard to affiliation, endorsement or support,\" Cohen said.\n\nCohen also said that the argument that NSJP was using the state as inspiration does not protect it from the law because of how strongly UCLA is connected in people's mind with its bear mascot.\n\n\"That's a possibility of a defense, which if they haven\u2019t made already they can likely raise, but the counter argument would be that because UCLA is hosting the event that the association will be stronger with the UCLA bear rather than the state of California,\" Cohen said.\n\nComparison of the UCLA Bruin Bear and the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) poster. Courtesy ACLU\n\nThe ACLU of Southern California sent UCLA a letter alleging the university failed to enforce similar rules regarding the use of its name with past student events and that the selective enforcement of the California state rule regarding its name was being used to chill the students free speech.\n\n\"Your emphasis on how 'some' might perceive symbols of Palestinian freedom indicates that the real reason for the University\u2019s unconstitutional censorship of SJP is the group\u2019s support for Palestinian rights,\" the ACLU letter states. \"Your sensationalist mischaracterization of SJP\u2019s viewpoint is further evidence of viewpoint discrimination.\"\n\nTod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for UCLA told NBC News in an email on Wednesday \"it was never about the bear all by itself\" and that it appreciated the groups alteration to remove the UCLA name. The university, which threatened to cancel the conference, also said that the event would go on as scheduled.\n\n\"As you may have heard, some members of the Jewish community have been sharply critical of upcoming conference, demanding that UCLA move to cancel it,\" the school said in statement provided by Tamberg. \"As a public university, UCLA is legally bound to comply with the First Amendment, which protects everyone\u2019s right to express their views, even those that are offensive and hateful or that the university opposes.\"\n\nCORRECTION (6:55 p.m. ET, Nov. 9, 2018): An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to UCLA\u2019s issue with the NJSP poster by leaving out the word \"kite\" after \"Palestinian flag.\" The school specifically objected to the image of the kite because they have been used by some groups to launch incendiary attacks on Israel.", "By Julie Moreau\n\nAs the sun set on Washington on Tuesday evening, a rainbow appeared over the Capitol. LGBTQ candidates and advocates hoped it was an early sign that a figurative \u201crainbow wave\u201d would sweep a historic number of lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer candidates into office.\n\nTheir hopes were arguably fulfilled. With a number of races still too close to call, more than 150 LGBTQ candidates emerged victorious in the midterms as of Friday afternoon. For perspective, there are currently less than 600 openly LGBTQ elected officials in the U.S. \u2014 just 0.1 percent of elected officials nationwide, according to the Victory Institute.\n\n\u201cFrom the U.S. Congress to governors\u2019 mansions to state legislatures and city councils, we are making historic inroads and growing our political power in ways unimaginable even a few years ago,\u201d former Houston Mayor Annise Parker, now the president and CEO of the Victory Institute and Victory Fund, said in a statement sent to NBC News. \u201cWe shattered lavender ceilings, achieved historic firsts and brought more LGBTQ representation to legislative bodies across the nation, which will help push equality forward.\u201d\n\nGOVERNOR\u2019S RACES\n\nFour LGBTQ candidates ran for governor, all Democrats, and two are projected to win.\n\nIn Colorado, with 99 percent of the votes in as of Friday afternoon, NBC News reported that Jared Polis is ahead of his Republican challenger, Walker Stapleton, with more than 52 percent for the vote. Polis is set to become the first openly gay man elected governor in the U.S.\n\nPatrick Egan, a politics professor at New York University, called Polis\u2019 victory a \u201cremarkable turnaround\u201d for the Centennial State, which in 1992 \u201cwas home of Amendment 2,\u201d which prohibited recognition of homosexuals as a protected class. And just over a decade ago, the state also passed Amendment 43, which prohibited same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThat says something about the transformation of that state, and of our country, when it comes to how voters think about LGBTQ candidates and LGBTQ rights,\u201d Egan said.\n\nOregon Gov. Kate Brown, a bisexual Democrat who in 2016 became the first openly LGBTQ person to be elected governor, was also projected to win her race. With 99 percent of the vote in on Wednesday afternoon, Brown was 6 percentage points ahead of Republican Knute Buehler.\n\nLupe Valdez, a lesbian Latina running in Texas, and Christine Hallquist, a transgender woman running in Vermont, were both projected to be defeated by their Republican challengers.\n\n\u201cThe big disappointment of the night is Christine Hallquist,\u201d Egan said, noting that she faced a popular Republican incumbent, Gov. Phil Scott. \u201cBut I don't think it takes anything anyway from her historic candidacy.\u201d\n\nCONGRESSIONAL RACES\n\nThere are currently seven openly LGBTQ members in Congress: Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo.; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I.; Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y.; Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.; Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis.; and Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif.\n\nThe incoming 116th Congress will welcome several new LGBTQ members, though the overall number of out members will only increase slightly, as some members \u2014 like Polis \u2014 have sought higher office.\n\nBaldwin, the first openly LGBTQ person elected to the Senate, was projected to win re-election. Sinema, who is running for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Jeff Flake, is in a tight race with Republican Martha McSally. As of Friday afternoon, the race was still too close to call: With 83 percent of precincts reporting, Sinema was ahead by nearly 10,000 votes. If she wins, she will be the first openly bisexual person elected to the Senate and the first female senator from Arizona.\n\nOf the estimated 20 openly LGBTQ major party candidates running for the House, eight won. The incumbent winners include Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif.; Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y.; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I.; and Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis. The new LGBTQ House members include Democrats Sharice Davids of Kansas, Angie Craig of Minnesota, Chris Pappas of New Hampshire and Katie Hill of California.\n\nWhen all the races are called, the number of LGBTQ members in both houses of Congress will climb slightly to nine.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic night in the fight for equality,\u201d Rep. Cicilline said in a statement. \u201cWe will enter the 116th Congress with an unprecedented number of LGBTQ members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are also celebrating the rise of a Democratic majority,\u201d Cicilline continued. \u201cIssues important to LGBTQ Americans, like the Equality Act\u2019s protection from discrimination and equal and affordable access to health care, will now be top priorities for the People\u2019s House. The LGBTQ members of Congress are ready to lead in the House to ensure equality for all across this country.\u201d\n\nThe wins by LGBTQ challengers helped give control of the House to Democrats. Democrats needed to pick up 23 seats to take control of the House, and as of Thursday, they had a net gain of 31.\n\nPappas won his race by a landslide to hold a Democratic seat and represent New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District, a district Trump won by 2 percentage points. With the win, Pappas becomes the first openly gay person to represent New Hampshire in Congress.\n\nDemocrat Sharice Davids flipped her district in Kansas against four-term incumbent Republican Kevin Yoder to become the first openly LGBTQ member of Congress from Kansas and one of the first two female Native Americans elected to Congress (along with newly elected Debra Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico).\n\n\u201cTonight Kansas voters gave the boot to a Trump ally and replaced him with a groundbreaking LGBTQ leader who spoke her truth throughout the campaign,\u201d former Houston Mayor Annise Parker, now the president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, said in a statement sent to NBC News. \u201cSharice\u2019s victory tonight will become a model for other LGBTQ leaders considering a run for office in red states or districts.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Angie Craig of Minnesota beat incumbent Rep. Jason Lewis, picking up an important seat for the Democrats. She also will be the first openly LGBTQ mother in Congress.\n\n\u201cAngie\u2019s victory is a historic moment that redefines what is possible for an LGBTQ person in Minnesota, and it is made even sweeter given she defeated one of the most homophobic and transphobic incumbents in the U.S. Congress to pull it off,\u201d Parker said.\n\nNBC News declared Katie Hill the apparent winner in her race for California\u2019s 25th District. With nearly all districts reporting, Hill had a nearly 3-point lead over her opponent, incumbent Republican Steve Knight as of Friday afternoon.\n\nSTATE AND LOCAL RACES\n\nState legislatures across the U.S. will elect a record-breaking number of LGBTQ representatives, according to Andrew Reynolds, professor of political science at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. There have never been more than 119 openly LGBTQ state representatives nationwide, but with 32 newly elected legislators as of Wednesday, the total will hit 129, according to Reynolds.\n\nThere were also several notable firsts in statehouses across the country. Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana will welcome the first-ever LGBTQ legislators.\n\nIn Kansas, Susan Ruiz and Brandon Woodard won seats in the Kansas House of Representatives. In Nebraska, Megan Hunt became the first openly LGBTQ candidate ever elected to the state legislature, and J.D. Ford defeated Republican Mike Delph, a staunch opponent of same-sex marriage, to become the first LGBTQ candidate elected to Indiana\u2019s General Assembly.\n\nNeil Rafferty won his race in the Alabama House of Representatives, Mary Washington will become the first only LGBTQ person of color elected to the Maryland Senate, and Malcolm Kenyatta is the first openly gay black man to win a seat in the Pennsylvania legislature.\n\n\u201cThe rainbow wave touched down in state capitals throughout the country on Election Day \u2014 with an astounding number of out LGBTQ candidates shattering long-standing political barriers and becoming historic firsts,\u201d Parker said.\n\n\u201cWhile our attention is often focused on Donald Trump and Congress, it is in our state legislatures where the most horrific attacks on LGBTQ equality are occurring. But personal relationships matter in these legislative chambers, and we know out LGBTQ officials significantly influence the votes of their colleagues on equality issues.\u201d\n\nState-level representation matters because of the number of anti-LGBTQ bills that have been introduced in the past several years. In 2017, 129 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced across 30 states, according to the Human Rights Campaign, 12 of which became law.\n\nTwo transgender women, Lisa Bunker and Gerri Cannon, also won their elections in New Hampshire, effectively tripling the level of transgender representation in statehouses across the U.S. Danica Roem, who in 2017 became the first transgender person elected to a state legislature, congratulated both Bunker and Cannon.\n\nThere are still more transgender candidates running in statehouse races that have yet to be decided, according to researcher Logan Casey, who tracks transgender political candidates nationally. These candidates include Everett Maroon of Washington, Amelia Marquez of Montana, Briana Titone of Colorado and Lasia Casil in Guam. A number of transgender candidates were also successful in local races for city council and school board.\n\nEgan said that candidates\u2019 LGBTQ identities were not a significant issue in any of the races.\n\n\u201cThe dog that didn't bark is definitely something of note, and that\u2019s definitely something good about 2018 and where we stand on these things,\u201d he said.\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

That all changed when Sessions became the first major lawmaker to put on a \"Make American Great Again\" cap in throwing his support behind the real estate developer and first-time political candidate. It wasn't the first time Sessions had appeared with the Queens, New York, native, but it was the first time he gave an official endorsement.\n\nTrump thanked him, saying, \"I am deeply honored to have the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, leader of congressional conservatives.

In September, 20 million people watched Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh testify before a Senate hearing on his nomination.\n\nRobert Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for TV and popular culture at Syracuse University, said the midterms represented one of the few times when the news concentrates on a single, shared story.\n\n\"Society in so many ways used to watch the same TV shows and then became totally fragmented,\" Thompson said. \"This is one story we are all following.\"\n\nThompson added that even the late-night shows on the broadcast networks touched on the midterms.\n\n\"We didn't have a choice,\" Thompson said. \"It was everywhere on all three networks and then into late night.\"\n\nChris Ruddy, chief executive of conservative TV channel Newsmax, said events like the midterms were starting to rival major sporting events.\n\n\"Politics is becoming like a sport,\" Ruddy said, noting that his Uber driver in New York on Tuesday night said traffic was light because everybody was watching the elections. \"The Super Bowl of elections, 2020, begins today, and we're expecting a really engaged audience for the next two years. Buckle up.\"\n\nEven as some viewing migrates online, few internet players were willing to share how many viewers livestreamed coverage online. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube declined to share any data on viewership or audience related to the midterms.\n\nThe major media companies, however, did release some data showing sizable online audiences. Fox News said its politics coverage received 8.8 million unique visitors and 4.9 million video starts, a metric that measures how many videos are watched.\n\nNBC News Digital reported 20 million video starts.\n\nFox News had the top video on social media with \u201cDems retake the house\u201d recording 1.8 million views on Facebook, according to social video analytics company Tubular.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The website also claimed it knew the results of the election, despite having obvious errors such as predicting a win by Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who did not run for re-election.\n\nThe website drew little attention despite efforts to tip journalists to its presence, and a survey by NBC News of social media accounts associated with the website showed that the campaign appeared to have had far less reach than the 2016 campaign that garnered millions of social media interactions and even tricked mainstream news outlets.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s relatively low impact left some experts wondering if Russia\u2019s ability to manipulate social media campaigns is diminishing \u2014 or if the country\u2019s multimillion-dollar influence campaign was bluffing after what appeared to be a failed disinformation operation.\n\nClint Watts, a former FBI agent who is an NBC News contributor, said the website along with the Twitter accounts and YouTube videos associated with it appeared to be the final part of a weekslong strategy aimed at baiting American media outlets into amplifying talking points about Russia\u2019s election hacking threat.\n\nWatts said inflating the impact of operations is \u201cas old as any Soviet disinformation strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re overt and sloppy, they\u2019re trying to convince you of something they didn\u2019t actually do,\u201d Watts said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re covert and they\u2019re found out later, they\u2019re trying to convince you of something they\u2019re actually trying to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also trying to show, \u2018A-ha, these social media companies can\u2019t stop us.\u2019\u201d\n\n55 Savushkina street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, a location used by the Internet Research Agency . Google Street View\n\nThe IRA emerged in the aftermath of the 2016 election as the primary source of Russia\u2019s election meddling efforts. Thirteen IRA employees based in St. Petersburg were indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller in February for meddling in the 2016 election, and another employee of the Kremlin-funded group was indicted last month for meddling in the midterms.\n\nOn Monday, Facebook announced it had taken down dozens of accounts on Instagram after a tip from law enforcement. NBC News flagged the IRA website to Facebook when it posted the names of the accounts on Tuesday.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson confirmed to NBC News that some of the accounts listed on USAIRA.ru were the same ones pulled from Instagram. Other accounts listed on the site, which had evaded detection, were pulled off of Instagram late Tuesday night by Facebook. Facebook cited U.S. government intelligence that had identified some of the accounts in its determination that the accounts were created by the IRA.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Department of Homeland Security said foreign influence campaigns remained active around the election.\n\nThe troll accounts ran the political gamut from fake liberal fan pages that supported CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert to accounts purporting to be run by far-right Infowars fans. Apolitical accounts trying to cast a wide net \u2014 like one called Fit Black Queens, which mostly posted women in workout clothes and had more than 1 million interactions \u2014 and far-right conspiracy accounts appeared to gain the most traction. Many of the new IRA accounts trafficked in the same tropes from the 2016 election, but have had less reach.\n\nOn Election Day, the website flaunted a massive influence campaign it claims went undetected, but did not provide much evidence as to its effectiveness.\n\n\"Whether you vote or not, there is no difference as we control the voting and counting systems. Remember, your vote has zero value,\" read text on the website. \"Facebook and intelligence agencies tried to stop us but they only managed to uncover 1/25 of the whole picture.\"\n\nAlex Stamos, a former Facebook chief security officer and now an MSNBC contributor, said that the midterms influence operation \u201clooks like an effort by the Russian troll factory to try to turn lemons into lemonade,\u201d and drum up fear in the American electorate.\n\n\u201cMost of the posts we observed looked to be aimed at building audiences to be manipulated later, which would be consistent with past Russian Internet Research Agency operations,\u201d Stamos said.\n\nBefore polls closed, the IRA site also posted a spreadsheet claiming to know the results of every Senate contest in advance.\n\n\u201cThe list of projected winners was laughably incorrect,\u201d Stamos said.\n\nThe people behind the website also appeared to try to stir up media coverage for the influence campaign. An NBC News reporter was sent a link to the USAIRA.ru website in a Twitter direct message on Sunday night. ThinkProgress disinformation reporter Casey Michel also received a message.\n\n\u201cDo you still worry about Russians controlling your selection? That is true. We\u2019re still doing it and no one, including Mueller, can stop us,\u201d the direct message read. The Twitter account associated with the direct message was suspended on Monday.\n\nLast week, a Russian troll, who had appeared in several anti-Hillary Clinton videos before the 2016 election, resurfaced in a new YouTube video that was quickly pulled down by the company. In the video, the man said that his name was \u201cWilliams\u201d and that he was trying to flee Russia but wasn\u2019t allowed to defect and feared for his future in the country. A Twitter account claiming to be from \u201cWilliams\u201d sent the video to several disinformation reporters last week before it was suspended by Twitter.\n\nIndependent disinformation researcher Josh Russell, who first identified hundreds of IRA accounts on Twitter and Reddit and who also received a message from \u201cWilliams\u201d last week, said he was grateful that mainstream media didn\u2019t bite on what he considered to be an obvious disinformation trap.\n\nHe also said the fact that foreign agents were able to create dozens of fake Instagram accounts without detection from the company shows that social media platforms are still far too susceptible to foreign disinformation campaigns.\n\n\u201cWhen you take a step back and look at what they were trying to accomplish in the midterms, it wasn\u2019t to really directly sway anyone within these groups,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt was to build a set of accounts they could throw out to the public after the election and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve been here the whole time.\u2019\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Alex Wong / Getty Images\n\nSessions was reviled in the marijuana industry and drug reform movements for his move in January to rescind an Obama-era policy mandating a mostly hands-off stance for federal enforcement of U.S. cannabis law in states that have legalized the drug.\n\nThe former senator also hit the brakes on sentencing reform policy. Sessions directed his federal prosecutors to seek maximum sentences for even low-level drug offenses.\n\nThe lawman's policies came at a time when drug reform groups had gained momentum, with some states legalizing marijuana, others recognizing medical pot, and still more reducing sentences for small-time drug crimes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Michigan became the tenth state to have legalized recreational cannabis. Another 32 have approved medical marijuana.\n\nThe pro-cannabis community never had high hopes for Sessions, who once said \"good people don't smoke marijuana,\" but his policies soon made him the legalization movement's biggest drag.\n\n\"He certainly made negative comments\" about pot, said Mason Tvert, spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project.\n\nHis reversal of Obama's cannabis enforcement policy, Tvert said, sparked an exodus of investment in marijuana at a time when money is being drawn to the sector by state legalization.\n\n\"It certainly had an impact on the market and investments \u2014 and resulted in deals falling through and people pulling money out of companies,\" he said.\n\nBut reality on the street was that Sessions' bark didn't match his bite. For example, his edict to enforce federal pot law \u2014 marijuana is labeled by the Drug Enforcement Agency as a schedule 1 drug alongside heroin and LSD \u2014 didn't inspire his troops to act.\n\nAfter Sessons' Jan. 4 directive, the U.S. Attorney in Seattle, Annette L. Hayes, said in a statement that her prosecutors would continue to \"focus on those who pose the greatest safety risk to the people and communities we serve.\"\n\n\"The Justice Department's marijuana policy in practice hasn\u2019t been that different than that of the previous administration,\" Tvert said.\n\nKevin A. Sabet, president of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, agreed that there's been a certain continuum. He said a personnel change shouldn't affect the law. \"This doesn\u2019t change anything,\" he said via email.\n\n\"Marijuana was against federal law before, during, and now after,\" Sabet said.\n\nStill, drug policy reform advocates would like to see an attorney general who reverses Sessions' pot enforcement mandate and who, like Trump, believes that cannabis legalization is a states' rights issue.\n\n\"Our hope is the next attorney general will recognize that it is not politically popular to escalate the war on drugs,\" said Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\nSessions' exit has already given a boost to marijuana stocks and investments.\n\nMicah Tapman, managing director at cannabis venture capital firm CanopyVentures, said recreational and medical campaign victories on Tuesday in Michigan and Missouri paired with Sessions' resignation Wednesday has had eager investors calling him on the phone.\n\n\"We survived Sessions,\" he said, \"and I think the future looks bright.\"", "Girl Scouts file lawsuit against Boy Scouts over name change copied!\n\nThe Girl Scouts say that by planning to drop \u2018Boy\u2019 from its name and allowing girls to join, the Boy Scouts are causing confusion and misleading some into thinking the groups have been merged.\n\nRead More", "FBI offering $15,000 reward in search for missing North Carolina girl copied!\n\nAn urgent manhunt is underway for 13-year-old Hania Aguilar, who police say was abducted right outside her home on Monday.

You don\u2019t accomplish a whole heck of a lot more in terminating him.\"\n\nBut Sessions' departure, which the president announced on Twitter after declining to do so during a nearly 90-minute press conference earlier in the day, is just the first in what administration observers expect will be a series of changes to Trump's Cabinet and White House lineup in the coming weeks.\n\nAs eager as he is to put any aspersions about Russian interference in the 2016 election behind him as he gears up for his 2020 re-election bid, Trump is equally eager to rid himself of lieutenants he perceives as disloyal, incompetent or simply misplaced in his administration.\n\nThe president frequently speaks disdainfully of members of his team, and he has mused openly about the possible departure of some, such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\n\"He may leave,\" Trump said on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" last month.\n\nIn the same interview, he said Mattis wasn't well informed on the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n\"I think I know more about it than he does,\" the president said.\n\nCloser in than his Cabinet, Trump is expected to make changes on his White House staff.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nIn forcing out Attorney General Jeff Sessions Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump may have signaled the beginning of the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nTrump had heeded the concerns of Republicans who worried that firing Sessions before Tuesday's midterm elections could spark a backlash among voters if they perceived him to be somehow obstructing justice.\n\nNow, with those elections just hours behind him and Sessions already out of the way, Trump's new acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker, will have authority over Mueller's purse strings, the parameters of his investigation, the timeline for the conclusion of his work and even his personal job security.\n\n\"The acting attorney general is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice,\u201d agency spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement.\n\nBut Washington insiders say it's unlikely Trump or his appointees will go so far as to sack Mueller \u2014 because they don't have to.\n\nMatt Schlapp, a close ally of the president and chairman of the American Conservative Union, said it makes sense for the Justice Department to end the probe sooner rather than later, and that there's no need to fire Mueller to get that done.\n\n\"It\u2019s perfectly appropriate for DOJ to decide to close down the investigation, because we just had a nationwide campaign in every corner of America where the Russia collusion theme was not brought up by Democrats,\" Schlapp said. \"If they decide to essentially end his work, he\u2019s still going to be able to testify on the Hill. They can\u2019t keep him quiet. You don\u2019t accomplish a whole heck of a lot more in terminating him.\"\n\nBut Sessions' departure, which the president announced on Twitter after declining to do so during a nearly 90-minute press conference earlier in the day, is just the first in what administration observers expect will be a series of changes to Trump's Cabinet and White House lineup in the coming weeks.\n\nAs eager as he is to put any aspersions about Russian interference in the 2016 election behind him as he gears up for his 2020 re-election bid, Trump is equally eager to rid himself of lieutenants he perceives as disloyal, incompetent or simply misplaced in his administration.\n\nThe president frequently speaks disdainfully of members of his team, and he has mused openly about the possible departure of some, such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\n\"He may leave,\" Trump said on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" last month.\n\nIn the same interview, he said Mattis wasn't well informed on the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n\"I think I know more about it than he does,\" the president said.\n\nCloser in than his Cabinet, Trump is expected to make changes on his White House staff.

The departure of Sessions places the acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trump conspired with Russia. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who previously was in charge, was in that role only because Sessions had recused himself, citing his role in the Trump campaign.\n\nNow, Whitaker, who was Sessions' chief of staff, takes the reins. Before he joined the government, he repeatedly criticized the Mueller probe, saying, for example, that Mueller should not investigate Trump's finances.\n\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee have not explicitly said they would re-open the committee's Russia investigation, which was closed in March by the Republicans in charge of the committee. But they have said there are many additional questions they would like to answer.\n\nRepublicans announced they had found no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia; Democrats proclaimed that a laughable whitewash. They noted that the committee had allowed Steve Bannon to dodge questions, had failed to demand relevant documents from the Trump campaign, and had not heard from key witnesses.\n\n\"We're certainly going to look at the work that we were able to do, we're going to look at the work that the GOP obstructed on our committee,\" Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who will chair the committee in January, said on MSNBC. \"We'll have to see what Bob Mueller has been able to do and what Bob Mueller has been able to say, either via indictment or via report, and that will also guide what we intend to do in our committee.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, after Sessions stepped down, Schiff tweeted that \"the Mueller investigation and the independence of the DOJ must be protected.\"\n\nBut regardless of how aggressively Schiff's committee moves to re-open its own investigation, the committee also plays another important role: Overseeing the executive branch and releasing its findings to the public.\n\nMueller is conducting a criminal investigation, using a grand jury that is bound by secrecy rules. He is supposed to prepare a report on his findings, but there is nothing that says that report must be made public.\n\nThe report would go to Whitaker, who could decide to stick it in a drawer.\n\nBut House Democrats could use their subpoena power to try to force the Trump administration to turn it over. They could also seek to compel witnesses to testify under oath \u2014 including, in theory, Mueller himself \u2014 about what they have found.\n\nHow much of that testimony could unfold in public would depend on how much information was classified. There is also an issue of grand jury secrecy. But there is little doubt that Democrats would seek to expose Mueller's findings, and Tuesday's election results give them the power to do so.\n\n\"We are immediately issuing multiple letters to key officials demanding that they preserve all relevant documents related to this action to make sure that the investigation and any evidence remains safe from improper interference or destruction,\" said Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, has been continuing to conduct its own Russia investigation, despite the House Republican findings. The Senate probe is led by a Republican, Richard Burr of North Carolina. Burr, who has said he will not run for-reelection, has not sought to protect the president at all costs, but he has also expressed skepticism about some lines of inquiry. The ranking Democrat, Virginia's Mark Warner, has been required to compromise on scope and investigative efforts to keep Burr on board, people involved have said.\n\nHouse Democrats will not have to compromise \u2014 they have all the power in their chamber.\n\n\"We will conduct the investigations that Republicans won't,\" Intelligence Committee member Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said on TODAY. \"We'll fill in the gaps on the Russia investigations. The American people will see his tax returns, not because of voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he is corrupt.\"\n\nSchiff hasn't said exactly what more he would like to investigate, but he did detail what he recommended the committee do before Republicans closed the investigation in March.\n\nAmong the steps he said Democrats were blocked from taking:\n\nCompelling testimony from Sessions; Donald Trump Jr.; Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; former communications director Hope Hicks and former bodyguard Keith Schiller.\n\nIssuing subpoenas for documents from the Trump campaign and transition and from George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and other key persons of interest.\n\nReferring to the House a contempt citation for Steve Bannon, to challenge the White House's order to him not to testify about the presidential transition, his tenure at the White House, and his communications with the president since leaving the administration.\n\nAnother witness House Democrats want to talk to is Randy Credico, a longtime friend of Trump adviser Roger Stone, who is alleged to have been Stone's backchannel to WikiLeaks, which released hacked Democratic emails prior to the 2016 election.\n\nCredico is ready, he told NBC News Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm not afraid to talk now and I would probably appear this time,\" Credico said. \"I would be open this time around to speak to the House....

But Republicans\u2019 tightened grip on the Senate means that those hoping for another round of dramatic, progressive reforms may be disappointed.\n\nEmpowered by voters outraged over Republican attempts to chip away at the law\u2019s protections for the sick, Democrats owe much of their midterm takeback to health care issues. And Democratic leaders say they are ready to get back to work, this time training their sights on skyrocketing drug prices, among other policy conundrums, with a majority of House votes and a slate of new committee chairmanships in hand.\n\nIn a few weeks, House Democrats will meet to elect their leaders, including several committee chairmen and women who will be responsible for the nation\u2019s health care policy and spending in the coming years. Hill denizens expect those currently serving as the top Democrat on most House committees to ascend to the chairmanships, with few if any members mounting serious challenges.\n\nThose basking in a post-\u201cblue wave\u201d glow would do well to temper their expectations, recalling that the Republican-controlled House had already voted 54 times to unravel some or all of the Affordable Care Act by its fourth birthday in 2014. In most cases, Democrats in the Senate and White House stopped those efforts in their tracks.\n\nWith the Senate (and the presidency) remaining under Republican control and even fewer moderate Republicans left in the House after this election, Democrats will struggle to move legislation without Republican support. What they can do is hold hearings, launch investigations and generally unnerve the pharmaceutical industry, among other likely adversaries.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a chance they could strike a deal with President Donald Trump, whose administration is moving to crack down on drug companies.\n\nWho are the members most likely to wield the gavels? And what will they do with that power? Here\u2019s a look at some of the major committees that influence health policy \u2014 and the people who may lead them.\n\nThe Committee on Energy and Commerce: Rep. Frank Pallone, New Jersey\n\nPallone, who has served in the House for 30 years, became the top Democrat on this influential committee in 2015. Should he become chairman, he would be responsible for the broadest health portfolio in the House, which includes Medicaid, public health, insurance and drug safety. This is the committee that marked up the Affordable Care Act in 2009 (when Pallone chaired the health subcommittee) and the House Republican repeal effort in 2017.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, Pallone has touted his stewardship of bipartisan legislation reauthorizing the fees charged to manufacturers to review the safety of prescription drugs and medical devices. He has also called for hearings on \u201cmega-mergers\u201d like the proposed merger between CVS and Aetna and worked with other Democrats to counter Republican attempts to undermine the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnsurprisingly, his influence over health care issues has attracted a lot of money from pharmaceutical companies, health professionals, HMOs and other industry players. By mid-October, Pallone had received more than $945,000 in campaign contributions from the health sector for this election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. According to a Kaiser Health News analysis, nearly $170,000 came from political action committees associated with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: Rep. Elijah Cummings, Maryland\n\nCummings could prove the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s biggest headache come next year. Having served as the committee\u2019s ranking member since 2011 \u2014 a post that lacks the chairman\u2019s subpoena power \u2014 he has been champing at the bit to hold drugmakers accountable.\n\nShortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Cummings approached him about working together to lower the cost of prescription drugs (to no immediate avail), and he has partnered with other lawmakers to demand information from pharmaceutical companies about their drug-pricing strategies. Previewing what a Cummings-led committee might look like, he has even launched his own investigations into drug costs, releasing reports with his findings.\n\nDrugmakers have wasted few campaign contributions on Cummings: He has received just $1,000 from their PACs this election, according to data analysis by Kaiser Health News.\n\nIn a statement to Kaiser, Cummings said Democrats would conduct \u201ccredible, responsible oversight\u201d of the Trump administration, adding: \u201cFor health care, that means investigating skyrocketing prescription drug prices, actions that would threaten protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, and efforts to undermine the Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nThe Committee on Ways and Means: Rep. Richard Neal, Massachusetts\n\nWays and Means oversees Medicare and influences health policy through its jurisdiction over taxes. Though Neal became the top Democrat on this committee in 2017, he has been involved in health care much longer, having played a part in the crafting of both the Affordable Care Act and the failed reform effort under the Clinton administration in 1993.\n\nFacing a primary challenger who touted her support for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d in his deep-blue district, Neal denied that he opposes the progressive single-payer proposal. But he also said Democrats should focus on shoring up the Affordable Care Act, particularly its protections for those with pre-existing conditions and caps on out-of-pocket expenses. (He won handily.)\n\nThe health sector was by far one of the top contributors to Neal\u2019s re-election campaign this year, giving more than $765,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Neal\u2019s district includes the headquarters of several health insurers and other medical companies, which makes him a prime target for campaign contributions.\n\nThe Committee on Appropriations: Rep. Nita Lowey, New York\n\nIf chosen, Lowey would become the first woman to chair the powerful House Committee on Appropriations, holding the nation\u2019s purse strings.\n\nLike Neal and Pallone, Lowey was first elected to Congress in 1988, and she became the committee\u2019s top Democrat in 2013. She has been a dedicated and effective advocate for investing in biomedical research into major diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s, as well as public health programs like pandemic preparedness.\n\nShe has also long championed women\u2019s health issues, proving a vocal critic of the Trump administration\u2019s proposed gag rule on Title X funding, among other policies. Watch for her to continue to push back on the administration\u2019s efforts to restrict access to abortion rights.\n\nAnd on the Senate side, the rumor mill favors Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to head the Committee on Finance, replacing the retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. Grassley served most recently as the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nSenate Republican leaders have signaled that entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid could use trimming and, with Republicans emerging from the midterms with a slightly bigger majority, this committee could have its hands full.\n\nHatch proved a friend to the pharmaceutical industry, and his war chest reflected that, taking in more than $850,000 in campaign contributions from drugmaker PACs in the past decade alone, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis. But Grassley has taken a more adversarial approach to the industry, working with a Democratic colleague last summer to pressure drug companies to list their prices in direct-to-consumer ads, for instance.\n\nGrassley held the chairmanship from 2003 to 2006, leaving him two more years at the top, should he want it. (Senate Republican chairmen may serve for only six years.) But he might choose to stay on as head of the Judiciary Committee, in which case the next chairman may be the next-most-senior Republican: Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho.\n\nEmmarie Huetteman: ehuetteman@kff.org, @emmarieDC\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service. It is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Source: Associated Press By Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court debated Wednesday whether to overturn a nearly $315 million judgment against Sudan stemming from the bombing of the USS Cole.\n\nThe question the justices are being asked to answer is where notice of the lawsuit against Sudan should have been mailed, to its embassy in Washington or its foreign ministry in the country's capital, Khartoum. It wasn't clear how the justices would rule.\n\nThe U.S. government has weighed in on the side of Sudan and against victims of the Cole bombing in October 2000 in which 17 American sailors died and dozens of others were injured.\n\nIn the case the justices were reviewing, a group of injured sailors and several of their spouses sued Sudan in a U.S. court, arguing that Sudan had provided support to al-Qaida, which claimed responsibility for the attack in Yemen. Two sailors injured in the bombing and relatives of sailors who died watched the high court arguments Wednesday.\n\nIn order to alert Sudan to the lawsuit, the group mailed the required notice to Sudan's embassy in Washington, a little over a mile from the White House.\n\nBut Sudan never responded and a court entered an approximately $315 million judgment against the country. Sudan wants that judgment thrown out, arguing that notice of the lawsuit should have been sent overseas. The Trump administration agrees.\n\nThe case did not seem to be one that would split the court along typical ideological lines. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Elena Kagan all seemed to approve of sending notice of the lawsuit to the embassy. Roberts said that his \"first thought\" if he wanted to send mail to a foreign official would be: \"Why don't I deliver it to the embassy?\" Kagan, meanwhile, told lawyer Christopher Curran, who was arguing on behalf of Sudan, that \"everybody understands that embassies are supposed to be the point of contact if you want to do anything with respect to a foreign government.\"\n\nBut Erica Ross, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, told the justices that the United States doesn't accept notice of lawsuits at its embassies abroad and that the United States has an interest in seeing foreign countries \"brought into our courts only under the same circumstances that we ask abroad.\"\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh all seemed inclined to side with the United States and Sudan. Sotomayor said it seemed natural to notify a foreign minister of a lawsuit \"where you're likely to find them,\" not at an embassy where they aren't regularly present.\n\nU.S. law doesn't make clear what the right answer is. A 1976 law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act lays out how to properly notify another country of a lawsuit filed in a U.S. court. If other agreements between the countries don't exist, the law says that notice should be \"addressed and dispatched ... to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\"\n\nLawyers for Sudan and for the U.S. government say the best reading of the law is that it requires the notice to be sent to the foreign minister in the foreign country. They also point out that an international treaty called the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which the United States signed, has been interpreted as prohibiting notice of a lawsuit to be mailed to an embassy.\n\nKannon Shanmugam, who was arguing for the USS Cole victims, said ruling for Sudan would force his clients to start their lawsuit over.\n\nAfter the arguments, Rick Harrison, who was injured in the attack, said the case has dragged on long enough and it \"would be ridiculous\" to start over again.\n\nDavid Morales, who also was aboard the Cole when it was struck, attended arguments with a reminder of the bombing, a small piece of the ship's hull that he said he carries with him \"everywhere I go.\"", "By Suzanne Gamboa\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Latinos and other minorities voted heavily for Democratic candidates, helping to drive the party\u2019s capture of the U.S. House in this year's midterm elections, experts said Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats will take control of the House when the next congressional session begins in January after picking up more than the 23 seats needed to reclaim the majority.\n\n\u201cThe net wave of the Democratic pickup is due entirely to strong support from minority communities who voted Democrat,\u201d Latino Decisions pollster Matt Barreto said in a conference call discussing the election eve poll of 9,425 Latino, African American, Asian Pacific Islander (AAPI) and Native American voters.\n\nData for the turnout of Latinos will not be available until later. On the morning of Election Day on Tuesday, the top-trending Google Search in the U.S. was \"d\u00f3nde votar,\" Spanish for where to vote.\n\nIn the Latino Decisions election eve survey, 73 percent of Latinos said they voted for the Democratic candidate, while 90 percent African Americans, 72 percent of AAPIs and 61 percent of Native Americans said they chose the Democrat. Forty-five percent of white voters cast their ballot for Democrats.\n\nNBC\u2019s national exit poll had similar, though slightly lower, results showing 69 percent of Latinos interviewed on Election Day after casting ballots voted for Democrats, while 29 percent supported Republicans.\n\nIn addition to helping Democrats win the House majority, Latinos came out strong for candidates such as Beto O'Rourke, the Texas congressman whose grassroots campaign drew national attention but fell short and put incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, on edge. Cruz ultimately defeated O'Rourke.\n\nThere had been late election angst on whether the Democratic party was doing enough to reach Latino voters. A tracking poll conducted by Latino Decisions showed that about 55 percent to 65 percent of Latinos said they had not been contacted about registering or voting.\n\nAccording to the NBC News Exit Poll, one in four Latino voters said they cast a midterm ballot for the first time this year.\n\nGreater shares of young Latinos, who make up a significant portion of the Latino electorate, voted for Democrats than of their older peers, turning out for candidates such as O\u2019Rourke and gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in Florida, according to the national exit poll.\n\nExit polls showed that 81 percent of the Latinos ages 18 to 29 and another 74 percent who were ages of 30 to 44 voted for Democrats. The next highest share voting for Democrats was Latinos ages 65 and older, 71 percent.\n\nAlthough the Latino Decisions and the national exit poll do not provide turnout numbers, Barreto said Texas counties from El Paso through the Rio Grande Valley that are majority Latino saw increases of Latino turnout of more than 100 percent.\n\nIn Dallas County, Latino turnout rose to 86 percent and helped contribute to Democrat Colin Allred\u2019s upset win over longtime incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions in the Republican-leaning, suburban Dallas district.\n\nThe increased turnout trickled down to the state level.\n\nCesar Blanco, chairman of the Texas House Democratic Campaign Committee, said Democrats gained 10 seats in the state House, including two Latinas who won in Dallas County districts. Voters also turned out state Rep. Matt Rinaldi, the Texas lawmaker who called Immigration and Customs Enforcement on protestors who were mostly Latino.\n\nThe gains are a \u201cgame changer,\u201d because the House partisan divide will now become 83 Republicans and 67 Democrats, from 95-55, Blanco said. Also, the Texas House speaker is elected by a majority of all members, not by the party with the most seats, so Democrats will have a larger vote on the next Speaker, he said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen these kinds of gains in the last three decades for Democrats,\u201d Blanco said, adding that the Latino vote contributed to the gains.\n\nPrecinct analysis from the Latino Politics and Policy Initiative at the University of California at Los Angeles, where Barreto is faculty co-director, showed Harris County had some of the highest vote increases in the county\u2019s majority Latinos precincts.\n\nThe analysis also showed that precincts in the county that were between 80 perecent and 100 percent Latino registered 80 percent to 90 percent support for O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe Harris County data suggests that Cruz captured closer to 20 percent or 23 percent of the Latino vote rather than the 37 percent reported in the national exit poll, Barreto said. The city of Houston is in Harris County.\n\nLina Hidalgo, 27, who was born in Colombia but raised in Peru and Mexico, defeated longtime Harris County Judge Emmett Eastman. In Texas, the chief executive for county government is called the county judge.\n\nIn Florida, Maria Cisneros, 20, was one of the young Latino voters who cast a ballot on Tuesday in Coral Gables, part of Florida House District 27, where Democrat Donna Shalala defeated Cuban American and Republican candidate Maria Elvira Salazar in the seat vacated by outgoing Republican congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.\n\nCisneros said she was compelled to vote because of recent school shootings such as the one in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\u201cIt really affected me,\u201d said Cisneros, who was born and raised in Venezuela before moving to Connecticut and then enrolling at the University of Miami.\n\nThe Latino Decisions poll found 72 percent of those surveyed in battleground districts and 75 percent of Latinos overall agreed that Congress should enact stricter gun laws.\n\nCisneros said that in 2016, she voted for Republican Sen. Marco Rubio because of his tough stance on Venezuela and that she would support other candidates who do the same.\n\nCisneros\u2019 vote demonstrates the swing nature of the some of the Latino vote in Florida where groups like Venezuelans, Cubans, and Nicaraguans, are at times, driven by the political situation in their home country and could favor candidates who campaign on those issues., but may not always vote on that basis.\n\nFor example, Democrats also won in Florida District 26, a district that has a large Cuban American population. In that district, voters rejected incumbent Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Cuban American, and backed Democrat Debbie Murcasel-Powell, who is of Ecuadoran and Lebanese descent.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Senate race between incumbent Democrat Sen.

She said she voted mostly Republican. \u201cThe country is in crisis. Our country is divided. There is no balance,\u201d Armas said.\n\nJanet Murguia, president of UnidosUS, pointed out that Scott spent $4 million on Spanish language television, compared to $1 million spent by Nelson. One of his ads ran during this year's World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to discount that Gov. Scott did do real outreach to Latino voters. I\u2019m not sure we saw the same energy and engagement by Sen. Nelson,\u201d Murguia said.\n\nScott also welcomed and provided assistance for Puerto Ricans who came to Florida to escape the devastation of Hurricane Maria. He made multiple visits to the island during its recovery.\n\n\"I was hearing from the ground ...'Oh, we know Rick Scott. He speaks Spanish. I know he's running for senator and he's been to Puerto Rico,\" said Betsy Franceschini, senior state director in Florida for the Hispanic Federation, a Latino advocacy group.\n\nEven so, 61 percent of Latinos in Florida said they did or would vote for Gillum and Nelson in the election eve poll done by Latino Decisions, Asian American Decisions and the African American Research Collaborative. A number of other minority advocacy and immigration groups helped fund the study.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, responsible for winning enough House elections to put the party in the majority, made Latino and minority turnout a priority this election cycle, getting started soon after President Donald Trump\u2019s election.\n\nAccording to the DCCC, it spent more than $21 million on coordinated and independent expenditures for Latino candidates, including spending on television, digital and radio ads and investment in field operations.\n\nOf the 111 districts it targeted this year, 29 were districts where 10 percent or more of the electorate is Latino. At the end of October, the DCCC - whose chairman and executive director are Latinos \u2014 released an ad in English and Spanish that didn't focus on a single candidate but on getting Latinos out to vote.\n\nThe Democrat Party, led by Tom Perez, also Latino, also devoted funding and staff to Latino and minority outreach and increased the diversity of its own staff.\n\nAdditional reporting from Carmen Sesin in Miami and Nicole Acevedo in New York.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Colorado father who killed pregnant wife, daughters pleads guilty copied!\n\nChristopher Watts pleaded guilty to killing his family on Tuesday, in a deal that will spare him the death penalty.\n\nRead More", "Big Question: What happens when there is no one left to tell the president no? 02:39", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Now, with Whitaker at the helm, Trump has someone leading the Justice Department who has already suggested that Mueller's probe should be reined in.\n\n\"If he was selected because he doesn't think it's an appropriate investigation, then I'm deeply concerned,\" said Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and general counsel at the FBI.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions speaks during a round table discussion at the Justice Department on Aug. 29, 2018. Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP file\n\nBefore Whitaker came to the Justice Department in 2017, he wrote an op-ed for CNN that said Mueller's investigation was \"going too far.\" He supported Trump's claim that the probe would be crossing a red line if it branched into the finances of Trump and his family.\n\nAs a legal commentator on CNN, Whitaker also said that Sessions could be replaced with someone who would reduce Mueller's budget.\n\n\"That attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,\" Whitaker said in July 2017.\n\nNow Whitaker will be in the position to do just that. Previously, whenever Mueller has needed permission to expand his scope or add more resources, he went to Rosenstein. That responsibility will now fall to Whitaker.\n\nRosenstein has also stood up to Republicans in Congress who have sought to publicly disclose documents related to the Russia investigation \u2014 a battle Whitaker may not be willing to fight.\n\nTrump's decision to replace Sessions with Whitaker rather than Rosenstein, the No. 2 at the Justice Department, has led to questions about the president's motives and whether the move strengthens Mueller's hand in pursuing an obstruction of justice case.\n\n\"I think we're watching obstruction of justice play out in plain sight,\" Frank Figliuzzi, the former assistant director of counterintelligence at the FBI, said on MSNBC.\n\nWhitaker, 49, served as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-09. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, he does not need to be sworn in or approved by the Senate to serve as the acting attorney general. He is allowed to serve 210 days before a full-time replacement who has been approved by the Senate must fill his spot.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Giuliani's lawyer, Faith Miller, said he was doing so because of \"a 30-year relationship with Mr. Trump.\"\n\nMiller maintained her client has been generous in supporting his wife, the former Judith Nathan, since their split, paying about $1 million in expenses. And, Miller noted, Giuliani has been working three jobs and is still making millions while the \"much younger\" Judith Giuliani, 63, \"chooses not to\" work.\n\nWhile Giuliani's alleged fountain pen spending was a surprise, his fondness for cigars is well known. He once graced the cover of Cigar Aficionado magazine, which last year hailed him as \"a stalwart defender of cigar rights.\" He's also a regular at the Grand Havana Club, an exclusive cigar smoking club in New York City, where membership costs over $7,500 a year.\n\nGiuliani had an ugly and very public divorce from his second wife, Donna Hanover, during his second term as mayor.

She was then taken to an enclosed area by an officer and told to show her bare breasts, which she did.\n\nJackson said she was then seen by a male nurse at the jail who began to ask her medical questions, including the date of her last menstrual cycle.

Florida now has more felons barred from voting than any other state.\n\n\"The historic significance of this is difficult to overstate,\" said Sean Morales-Doyle, a lawyer in the Democracy Center at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, which has been trying to overturn the Florida law for nearly two decades. \"Just in terms of the number of people impacted by this, there are few parallels in the world of voting-rights advances.\"\n\nFlorida's strict felon disenfranchisement law is a relic of the period of Reconstruction after the Civil War, when black people were given the right to vote. In response, many states, particularly in the South, enacted laws that sought to limit their freedoms, mainly by toughening penalties for crimes and then targeting black people with biased enforcement. With more black people convicted of crimes, limiting felons' ability to vote undermined their political power.\n\nToday all but two states, Maine and Vermont, have some sort of felony disenfranchisement law, with an estimated 6 million Americans unable to vote because of them. Some states have moved to make their felony disenfranchisement laws less strict, but Florida, until this year, resisted. With Tuesday's results, Florida will allow felons to regain their voting rights after completing their sentences, including parole or probation, except for those convicted of murder or sex offenses. Kentucky and Iowa are now the only states that permanently bar all felons from voting. Virginia does as well, but uses an executive clemency program to work around it.\n\n\"I do think hopefully this has an effect on the momentum for felony rights restoration across the country,\" Morales-Doyle said.\n\nHoward Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, which spent more than $5 million on the campaign to eliminate the disenfranchisement provision, said in a statement that Tuesday's vote was \"one of the largest expansions of the franchise in our nation\u2019s history.\"\n\nLouisiana kills law rooted in white supremacy\n\nThe vote to end nonunanimous jury verdicts in felony cases in Louisiana will scrap a system that researchers say was created to boost white supremacy by ensuring convictions of black defendants.\n\nIt was created in 1898, when the drafters of Louisiana's Constitution found a back-door method to put more black people in prison \u2014 and keep them out of the voting booth, researchers say.\n\nThe law allowed nine jurors to vote for conviction, instead of all 12. The law was changed in 1973 to increase the number of votes to 10.\n\nNew Orleans resident Molly Ezell holds a sign on Oct. 29 in New Orleans promoting a Louisiana constitutional amendment that would require unanimous 12-member jury verdicts in serious felony cases. Kevin McGill / AP\n\nEither way, it has been used to disproportionately target black people: An analysis this year by The Advocate newspaper found a wide disparity between the conviction rates of black defendants and of white defendants by nonunanimous juries.\n\n\"It has clearly had a racially adverse impact on black defendants,\" said Lawrence Powell, a Tulane University historian.\n\nIt is also seen by critics as a blatant violation of the right to fair and impartial trials.\n\nJohn Kay Jr., Louisiana state director of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy organization backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, said he didn't realize that Louisiana allowed split verdicts until he learned of the campaign to prevent them. He joined the effort.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think a lot of people even in political circles knew this was on the books in Louisiana,\" Kay said. \"It was one of those things we took for granted.\"\n\nWith Tuesday's vote, Oregon remains the only state that allows split verdicts. Oregon's law was enacted in the 1930s as a response to fears of immigrants and Jews, researchers say. There is a pending legal challenge to the law, and lawmakers have said they\u2019ll bring it up in next year\u2019s legislative session.\n\nKay and others see Tuesday's vote as part of Louisiana's attempt to drop its reliance on mass incarceration. It has enacted reforms that have shrunk the prison population and narrowly approved a bill to restore voting rights to people on parole or probation. The state no longer has the country's highest incarceration rate.\n\n\"This is a defining moment for us about who we are as a people in the state of Louisiana,\" Allen-Bell said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He is expected to make his initial appearance on the new charges Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe FBI says that Yohai had been hard to find because over the past several months he's driven two different Rolls Royces, a Porsche Panamera, a Cadillac Escalade, and a Range Rover \u2014 all likely rented, the bureau says in court documents, in an effort to avoid detection.\n\nYohai, who divorced Jessica Manafort in August 2017, was previously charged by federal prosecutors with conspiracy to commit bank and aggravated identity theft after defaulting on $15 million in real estate loans.\n\nJeffrey Yohai in New York in January 2015. Madison McGaw / BFA/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIn February 2018, Yohai pleaded guilty to misusing construction loan funds and another charge. His sentencing was continued to Jan. 18, 2019.\n\nAccording to the complaint in the original case, in 2015 and 2016 Yohai obtained $15 million in loans to purchase and rehabilitate three properties in the Hollywood Hills, then defaulted on the loans.\n\nFederal prosecutors now say his modus operandi in his \"new crimes\" is \"strikingly like\" that of his original federal offenses, and \"involves some of the same participants.\"\n\nWhile Yohai was out on bond awaiting sentencing for his original offenses, say prosecutors, he and alleged co-conspirators would trick lenders into providing millions of loans based on false and inflated property appraisals of luxury homes that they did not own. They would then promise the actual owners of the luxury homes that they would secure wealthy short-term renters for their properties.\n\nAccording to the 43-page complaint filed Oct. 17 in the Central District of California, Yohai would then use the money to pay pre-existing debts or personal expenses.\n\nWhile he was collecting rent from tenants, including an unidentified NBA basketball player who paid $50,000 in rent for two months, prosecutors say Yohai kept the scam going by supplying the real owners of the properties with worthless checks and falsified wire transfer records.\n\nIf the victim demanded repayment, Yohai would often buy time by sending checks written on accounts with insufficient funds. When those checks bounced, according to the complaint, Yohai would assert he wired the money back to the victim and send fake wire transfer documentation, \"insisting that there must be some banking mistake to explain why the funds never arrive.\"\n\nThe complaint alleges Yohai made false statements to investors during a lunch to the effect that \"he 'turned state's evidence' on \u2026 Manafort\" and \"that he had to go to 'D.C.'\" to meet with staff from special counsel Robert Mueller's office or \"downtown\" to meet with \"the feds.\" But the complaint does not specify whether Yohai ever met with any members of Mueller's team, and makes no further mention of the special counsel, whose investigation led to his ex-father-in-law's conviction and guilty pleas on multiple criminal counts.\n\nFederal prosecutors in California and the special counsel have looked into Manafort's business deals with Yohai, who was Manafort's partner in four California property deals that failed and were placed in bankruptcy. Manafort's holding company, MC Brooklyn Holdings, also bought a brownstone in Brooklyn, New York, in December 2012 for $2,995,000 that was brokered by Yohai, real estate postings online show.\n\nManafort pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller shortly before the start of his second trial in mid-September.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Leigh Ann Caldwell\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans spent plenty of time over the past election year warning their voters that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi would return to the national stage as House speaker if they didn't stop her party from taking control of Congress. Some Democratic candidates running in highly competitive districts even pledged not to support her. And at times over the past year, her own colleagues have agitated against her return to power.\n\nDespite all that, Pelosi, the longtime California congresswoman who made history in 2007 by becoming the first woman to hold the House gavel, is poised to become speaker again after a midterm election that swept Democrats back into the majority.\n\nPelosi has been speaking privately with members, including those just elected, attempting to shore up her support and making the case that she is the best person to move the party forward. Some supporters say her experience is needed to maneuver a party that must confront President Donald Trump and an enhanced Republican Senate majority.\n\nWhile she there is a cohort in the party who doesn't want her to take the reins, no other Democrat has emerged as a credible threat to Pelosi's leadership.\n\nWhen asked by reporters on Wednesday whether she is confident of being elected Speaker, Pelosi said, \"yes I am.\"\n\n\u201cI don't think anyone deserves anything. It's not about what you have done, it's about what you can do,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you have done in the past speaks to your credentials,\u201d she added, \u201cand I think I'm the best person to go forward to unify, to negotiate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think my case is about being the best person for how we go forward.\u201d\n\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who has been one of her most vocal critics, doesn't want to run for the position, according to his spokesman Matt Corridoni. And Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who ran against Pelosi in the last Congress, getting 63 votes compared to Pelosi's 134, has not stepped forward to launch another challenge.\n\nBut her detractors say her path is narrow. She needs a majority of voting members, both Republican and Democrat, on the House floor to vote for her. If all Republicans vote against her, she can only afford to lose about a dozen Democrats, depending on how many seats Democrats end up winning after all the races are totaled.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, is expected to remain in his position, too. \"I'll certainly be running for majority leader,\" not speaker, Hoyer told reporters, officially announcing his intention on Wednesday. The party's third-ranking member, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, plans to run for that spot again, telling reporters that he is sending a letter on Wednesday to his colleagues asking for their support.\n\nPelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn all say that they will be transitional figures, preparing the next generation of leaders. Whether that means Pelosi will pledge to serve just one term is unclear.\n\nDemocrats' dissatisfaction with Pelosi reached a boiling point in the last Congress when a new generation of members, many of whom had only served in the minority, grew frustrated with a lack of upward mobility and a leadership structure where the top two members \u2014 Pelosi and Hoyer \u2014 had served in those positions since 2002.\n\nShortly after the House outcome became clear on Tuesday, Pelosi was asked what her message is to newly elected Democrats who said they wouldn't vote for her as speaker. \"Congratulations on winning,\" she said.\n\nPelosi got a boost of support from an unlikely source on Wednesday \u2014 President Trump, who said, perhaps because she's an easy target for Republicans, the Democrat deserved the speakership. \"In all fairness,\" Trump Tweeted, \"Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!\"\n\nRepublicans, who will be in the minority come January, are facing a leadership shuffle, too.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is retiring, and his second in command, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, is running for minority leader. But one of the most conservative members of the House, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is an aggressive defender of the president, has launched his bid for leader as well. And there's already jockeying for other GOP leadership posts. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming announced her intention to run for House GOP conference chair.\n\nBut while Pelosi's path back to power appears clear, House Democrats face a challenging atmosphere for the next two years.\n\nFor the first time in his presidency, Trump will be forced to deal with congressional Democrats who now have the power to stop his agenda, promote their own and launch a myriad of investigations into his administration.\n\nAn increased Senate majority and the president's veto pen will all but ensure that Democratic legislative priorities go unfulfilled. And both parties will almost certainly busy themselves gearing up for the presidential election in 2020.\n\nWhile there is historical precedent for divided government to reach common ground and address national problems, the current political environment makes the prospects unlikely, some members say.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very tough to govern over the next two years,\u201d retiring Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., told NBC News.\n\nDemocrats believe the midterm elections were a referendum on Trump and Republican policies, a repudiation of GOP effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, construct a $25 billion border wall and push additional tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nThere's little incentive to work together on legislation. The president\u2019s overt appeals to his base, while making him hugely popular among Republicans, has made him deeply unpopular among Democrats and many independents.\n\nAnd Democratic activists are demanding that their congressional leaders do what they can to stop the president in his tracks.\n\n\u201cThe most immediate priority has to be real oversight and accountability that has been shockingly absent over the last two years,\u201d said Ben Wikler, executive director of the progressive group MoveOn.\n\nDavid McIntosh, a former member of Congress and current head of the conservative Club for Growth, said such activists are \"so angry that I don\u2019t see opportunities to work together.\"\n\nPelosi would be in charge of the most diverse caucus in history with a record number of women being elected to the House on Tuesday, including the first two Native American women and the first Muslim woman.\n\nThe number of members who represent districts that supported the presidential candidate of the opposite party has also dwindled in the 2018 midterms.\n\nBut the Congressional Progressive Caucus is likely to have more weight as it is likely to increase its ranks from 78 members, which will pressure Democratic leadership to enact more of its agenda.\n\nShaunna Thomas, executive director of UltraViolet, a progressive feminist activist group, said that the group\u2019s members will immediately put pressure on elected officials.\n\n\u201cWe really get to work the day after the election to ensure that the people who now have the power will be held accountable to an agenda that will ensure that they are serving their constituents in a way that they deserved to be heard,\u201d Thomas said.", "Big Question: What happens when there is no one left to tell the president no? 02:39", "Full video: Trump's heated post-midterm elections press conference copied!\n\nPresident Trump held a press conference following the midterm elections on Wednesday, in which Democrats regained control of the House and Republicans held the Senate.

This has a minimum age of around 40,000 years and is now the earliest known figurative artwork,\u201d Maxime Aubert of Australia\u2019s Griffith University, who led the study team, said in a statement.\n\nHuman figures from East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. This style is dated to at least 13,600 years ago but could possibly date to the height of the last Glacial Maximum 20,000 years ago. Pindi Setiawan\n\nEven if they are not the absolute record holders in terms of age, the images show that people across the world from one another were doing similar artwork in caves at the same time.\n\n\u201cIt is now evident that rock art emerges in Borneo at around the same time as the earliest forms of artistic expression appear in Europe in association with the arrival of modern humans (45,000\u201343,000 years ago),\u201d Aubert and colleagues wrote in their report.\n\nThe limestone caves are in a heavily forested part of Borneo\u2019s Kalimantan province, in Indonesia. Archeologists have been exploring the difficult-to-reach caves, which had been known to be richly decorated by humans.\n\nNew dating methods show they are far older than anyone had thought they were. The team used uranium dating of the calcium carbonate deposits that built up over and around the paintings.\n\nSome of the oldest dating involved a painting of what appears to be a type of cattle, painted in reddish-orange color.\n\nThe world's oldest figurative artwork from Borneo dated to a minimum of 40,000 years Luc-Henri Fage\n\n\u201cThe image is incomplete and the animal depicted is therefore unclear, but it appears to be a large ungulate that possibly has a spear shaft protruding from its flank,\u201d the team wrote. It may depict a banteng, a species that still exists today.\n\nOther art dates back to around 20,000 years ago, and the findings indicate people were using the remote caves for millennia.\n\nMuch of it clearly had meaning, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cMany of these stencils are partly in-filled with painted lines, dashes, dots and small abstract signs that possibly represent tattoos or other marks of social identification, and in some instances hand stencils are linked together by painted mulberry lines that form intricate tree-like motifs, which perhaps symbolize kinship connections,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cSome figures are depicted in narrative scenes as hunting or pursuing small deer or as engaged in enigmatic social or ritual activities (for example, \u2018dancing\u2019),\u201d they added.\n\nModern humans arose in Africa and spread across the world in several waves, reaching Australia across the Asia-Pacific somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000 years ago \u2014 researchers differ on this.\n\nModern-day Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua-New Guinea are believed to have been part of the route they took.\n\nThe same team reported in 2014 that they had discovered 40,000-year-old cave art on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.\n\n\u201cWho the ice age artists of Borneo were and what happened to them is a mystery,\u201d said team co-leader Pindi Setiawan, an archeologist at the Bandung Institute of Technology who worked on the study team.\n\nOlder hominid species also lived in the area, including the \"hobbit\" Homo floresiensis, whose remains date back 700,000 years.\n\nAnd modern humans are not the only known cave artists.

He added in another tweet that he didn't \"blame\" the U.S. Secret Service agent who stopped him.\n\n\"I know he's just doing his job,\" Acosta wrote.\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders later issued a statement that said the reporter's \"hard pass\" was suspended as a result of his attempt to keep control of a microphone during Wednesday's news conference with the president.\n\nShe said Acosta put \"his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern\" during the session, a claim that doesn't appear to be supported by video of the incident.\n\nThe press secretary called Acosta's behavior \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\n\"It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter\u2019s colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question,\" Sanders stated.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, CNN challenged Sanders' account and argued that the suspension of Acosta's credentials \"was done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today's press conference.\"\n\n\"Press Secretary Sarah Sanders lied,\" the cable news network said of the explanation. \"This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better. Jim Acosta has our full support.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night, Acosta said, \"I never thought in this country that I wouldn\u2019t be able to go cover the president of the United States simply because I was trying to ask a question.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said in a statement late Wednesday that it \"strongly objects to the Trump Administration\u2019s decision to use U.S. Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it has a difficult relationship.\"\n\nThe group added, \"We urge the White House to immediately reverse this weak and misguided action.\"\n\nEarlier in the day Trump called Acosta \"a rude, terrible person\" as he tried to ask the president a question.\n\nThe exchange came during a White House press conference on the 2018 midterm elections, in which Trump called out failed Republican candidates who didn't \"embrace\" him.\n\nTrump began taking questions and called on Acosta, who tried to ask about the president's characterization of a migrant caravan of roughly 4,000 Central American immigrants who are walking through Mexico to claim asylum in the U.S.\n\nTrump immediately interrupted Acosta as the journalist began to ask his question. \"Here we go,\" Trump said to Acosta.\n\nAcosta then challenged Trump's use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the caravan and asked the president if he thought he had demonized immigrants. Trump then said he wanted immigrants to \"come in legally.\"\n\nWhen the president tried to go to another journalist, Acosta declined to give up the microphone and asked about possible indictments by special counsel Robert Mueller based on the ongoing investigation into Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nTrump told Acosta to \"put down the mic\" and a White House staffer tried to take the microphone from the CNN correspondent but he wouldn't give it up.\n\nAcosta finally relinquished the mic and sat down, but Trump then began to verbally berate him from the lectern.\n\n\"CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them,\" Trump said. \"You are a rude, terrible person.

Democrats would pick up dozens of House seats in the midterms, and might even take the Senate.\n\nAnd President Donald Trump, said liberals and many in the press, was hastening this wave personally. His message was racist, his speeches fear-mongering and his \u201cnationalism\u201d and \u201cglobalism\u201d were none-too-subtle signals to white supremacists and anti-Semites that a fascist takeover was in the works.\n\nYet, Trump\u2019s message in large part prevailed. In many key states where he campaigned aggressively \u2014 including Florida, Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 Republican statewide candidates prevailed, perhaps due to Trump\u2019s rollicking, improvisational rallies. He certainly didn\u2019t hurt them.\n\nThe expected \u201cthumping\u201d and \u201cshellacking\u201d \u2014 terms deployed respectively by George W. Bush and Barack Obama to describe their party\u2019s major midterm defeats \u2014 didn\u2019t materialize.\n\nSure, Democrats won the House of Representatives. But the expected \u201cthumping\u201d and \u201cshellacking\u201d \u2014 terms deployed respectively by George W. Bush and Barack Obama to describe their party\u2019s major midterm defeats \u2014 didn\u2019t materialize. It was basically an average midterm loss for a sitting president.\n\nThe likely clamoring by Democrats that the \u201cpopular vote\u201d in the House went strongly for Democrats is bunk. Republicans devoted their resources to close races, not to trying to prevent Democrats from running up the score in urban areas. It is impossible to say what the vote count would be if the House was apportioned based on the popular vote.\n\nSo why did the country fail to reject Trumpism?\n\nWhat liberals who believed the president would provoke a tsunami of new House Democrats failed to understand \u2014 as they failed to understand in 2016 \u2014 is that the caricature of Trump and his supporters they revel in is fiction. Trump addresses \u2014 flamboyantly and divisively, to be sure \u2014 the serious concerns of average Americans worried that their country is changing too fast. These voters are concerned that the nation they\u2019ve known, and that has in many ways been remarkably successful, is slipping away from them.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, left, embraces Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, during a campaign rally on Oct. 22, 2018, in Houston. Eric Gay / AP\n\nEven establishment Republicans don\u2019t get it. They begged Trump to emphasize the economy during his rallies. But Trump, who is preternaturally connected to the GOP base \u2014 for a New York businessman, in particular \u2014 understands that many Americans are deeply concerned about events like the migrant caravan. It is not because they are all racists \u2014 though, of course, a small subset of them are. It is because Americans understand that an unceasing influx of people can be complicated to absorb.\n\nSimilarly, many Americans understand that if Trump nastily attacks African Americans like Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., or failed Democratic Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, it does not make him a racist. He is going after them because they are very liberal Democrats. Nor does it make him sexist when he shuts down two female reporters at an October press conference \u2014 as was widely alleged. He also shut down two male reporters during the same event.\n\nTrump is an equal-opportunity insulter. Just ask the white, black and Hispanic males he eviscerated during the 2015-16 Republican primaries.\n\nNeither is fear-mongering a sin \u2014 when there is something to be fearful about. Playing on fears is a tactic used by all politicians. It is employed more ostentatiously by Trump, but Democrats, including Obama, have similarly preyed on the fears of gays, seniors, African Americans and others when warning about the possibility of Republicans winning elections. \u201cThey're going to put y'all back in chains,\u201d Vice President Joe Biden warned a largely black audience during the 2012 campaign. But the press fails to play up Democratic demagoguery the way it does Trump\u2019s.\n\nMany American voters believe that anti-globalism is not akin to buying into a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to control the banking system, or something like that. It reflects a fear that whether talking about the United Nations or international treaties like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the Paris climate change agreement, U.S. sovereignty is threatened by bureaucrats overseas.\n\nThe news is not all good for Trumpism. His failure to maintain GOP control of the House signals problems in suburban areas, where women, moderates and even some Republicans are turned off by the president\u2019s brutally direct, divisive and insulting style. This no doubt helped cost the GOP Virginia\u2019s 10th District \u2014 a Washington suburb where Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock was defeated Tuesday night.\n\nBut Trump has demonstrated time and again that he is not going to change. And having helped increase the Republican majority in the Senate, Trump has shown that he doesn\u2019t have to; the Senate reflects the Electoral College. If anything, the midterms suggest Democrats should be even more concerned about their prospects in the 2020 presidential campaign. Because Trump has demonstrated that despite receiving endlessly negative coverage, and despite Republicans being outspent by Democrats in the midterms, his brand of politics is not \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 still resonates with a significant portion of American voters.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results showed that the 2016 elections were not an aberration. They reflected deep anxieties in the electorate. Fears that may be strong enough to keep Trump in power until January of 2025 \u2014 and maintain the popularity of the policies he advocates.", "Get the Mach newsletter.\n\nBy Tom Metcalfe\n\nThe moon\u2019s appearance changes drastically over the course of each month, from a crescent to a half-disk and then a full disk \u2014 and then back again. What causes these so-called phases of the moon?\n\n\u201cThe moon\u2019s phases are a reflection \u2014 quite literally \u2014 of how much of the lunar surface is illuminated by the sun, as seen from Earth,\u201d says Shoshana Weider, a planetary scientist who has worked with NASA\u2019s Lunar Science Institute. \u201cThis amount changes over the course of a lunar month, which lasts about 29.5 days, according to the relative positions of the Earth, moon and sun in the sky.\u201d\n\nLunar phases explained\n\nExcept for those times when the moon falls into Earth\u2019s shadow to cause a lunar eclipse, half of the moon\u2019s surface is always illuminated by sunlight and half is always shadowed.\n\nSometimes the moon presents its full sunlit side toward Earth; at these times, we see a full disk of reflected sunlight, or a full moon. At other times only a portion of the moon\u2019s sunlit side points our way, so we see a sliver of reflected sunlight \u2014 a crescent moon or gibbous moon. Sometimes the moon presents only its shadowed face \u2014 what we call a new moon \u2014 and we can\u2019t see the moon at all.\n\nEach lunar month begins with a new moon, followed three or four nights later by a waxing crescent (waxing means getting larger). About seven nights after the new moon, we see half of the moon\u2019s disk \u2014 a phase called the first quarter. Then comes a waxing gibbous moon, which is between half-full and full.\n\nThe full moon appears about two weeks after the new moon. Though the moon looks full for three or four days, in reality it\u2019s full for only a few moments on a specific day.\n\nIn the second half of a lunar month, the moon starts to wane. First comes a waning gibbous moon, then a last quarter, then a waning crescent \u2014 and then back again to a new moon.\n\nEclipses of the sun occur only during a new moon, when the moon passes between Earth and the sun. But because the moon orbits Earth at a different angle than Earth orbits the sun, a new moon brings a solar eclipse only occasionally.\n\nIn the same way, lunar eclipses occur only during a full moon, when Earth passes between the moon and the sun, But there's no eclipse unless the moon and the sun line up exactly.\n\nMoon phases in folklore and history\n\nHuman nature and the world around us have often been linked to the phases of the moon.\n\nThe term \u201clunatic,\u201d for example, was coined because odd behavior or mental illness was thought to be triggered by the changing moon, Weider says, adding that farmers once believed that fence posts should be set during the new moon; animals should not be weaned during a waning moon; animals slaughtered during a waxing moon give juicier meat; and the best fishing days occur between the new and full moon.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s earliest calendars, developed in the ancient Middle East by the Babylonians about 2,500 years ago, were based in part on the moon\u2019s phases. And the moon phases are still used to determine many religious observations. Islamic and Hebrew holidays, for example, are tied to dates in lunar months, says Gordon Johnston, a NASA program executive who has worked on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Easter, of course, falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring.\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT THE MOON?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "By Julie Moreau\n\nIn the first statewide referendum on transgender rights, Massachusetts voters on Tuesday said \u201cyes\u201d to maintaining a 2016 law that extended nondiscrimination protections to transgender people, including their use of public bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nWith nearly 50 percent of precincts reporting, the \u201cYes\u201d vote garnered 70 percent of the vote, compared to 30 for the \u201cNo\u201d vote. The results are pending official confirmation.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts voters reaffirmed our Commonwealth as a place that fiercely defends our basic values of dignity and respect for everyone,\u201d Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement shared with NBC News. \u201cAt a time when transgender rights are being threatened nationally, we absolutely must preserve the rights we have secured at the state level.\u201d\n\nThe outcome in Massachusetts was a huge relief to LGBTQ-rights activists across the country, who feared that a vote to repeal the 2016 law would prompt a wave of similar efforts to roll back protections in other states.

We will move forward, developing other strategies to protect the rights of those who are negatively affected by this law.\u201d\n\nThe ballot measure attracted the attention of celebrities and transgender advocates across the U.S., who used the hashtag #YesOn3 to show their support for the anti-discrimination measure.\n\nAccording to data collected by the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank, Massachusetts is one of only 19 states and some 250 municipalities with transgender nondiscrimination protections in public accommodations.\n\nNorth Carolina remains the only state to have successfully passed (and then subsequently repealed) legislation that restricted transgender people\u2019s usage of sex-segregated public facilities, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

And an overwhelming majority of the remaining 2 percent live out their days on farms, working as breeders, he added.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything we can do to make sure that every one of them gets adopted,\u201d Gartland told NBC News on Wednesday.\n\nHumane Society Florida Director Kate MacFall, at the forefront of Amendment 13 campaigning, said her phone has been ringing off the hook on Wednesday with calls from prospective greyhound owners.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re amazing pets, so gentle and sweet,\u201d MacFall said. \u201cThey really are gentle giants.\u201d\n\nBut Brooke Stumpf, president of the adoption group GreytHounds of Eastern Michigan, said she worries about untold thousands of greyhounds now at breeding farms throughout the South and Midwest.\n\nWith a majority of the nation's dog tracks slated to close by the end of 2020, young greyhounds that never make it to the track will need homes too.\n\n\"This will be a burden. We're mobilizing now,\" said Stumpf, whose group arranges 50 to 100 greyhound adoptions a year \u2014 but will now aim for an annual goal of 200. \"We'll do the best we can. Some of these dogs might end up at shelters and they're not all no-kill. That's the scary part.\"\n\nAll of these Florida active-racing greyhounds won\u2019t be cut loose immediately, as dog racing won\u2019t be illegal in the Sunshine State for another 25 \u00bd months. Both sides expect a gradual shutdown of these tracks in the next two years.\n\nThe state is home to 11 of America's 17 dog tracks, with greyhounds also running in West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas and Iowa.\n\nEven before Tuesday's vote, dog racing in Florida has been losing business for years. Back in 1992, there were $1.5 billion in dog-racing bets, adjusted for inflation, compared to just $200 million in 2017, according to state records.\n\n\u201cThis is a crushing blow to this industry,\u201d MacFall said. \u201cThis (vote) shows people care about dogs and people know this (dog racing) is cruel and inhumane.\u201d\n\nMacFall admitted she and other supporters were surprised by the final margin of victory.\n\n\u201cWe thought it\u2019d be close, we didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be that high. It turned out to be a landslide,\u201d MacFall said. \u201cI mean we can\u2019t agree on anything here in Florida. But on this, we had bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nGartland also said Tuesday\u2019s final tally floored him.\n\n\u201cIt was fairly stunning, I was very surprised,\u201d a downcast Gartland said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The first openly gay male governor.\n\nThe 2018 midterms will be remembered as an election of firsts that swept in a class of politicians who better represent the diversity of the country than any before it.\n\nMore than 200 of the candidates running in congressional and statewide races on Tuesday were black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, LGBTQ or intersectional. More than 80 of those candidates won their elections.\n\nAnd diversity matters, said Christina Greer, associate professor of political science at Fordham University. \u201cWomen are the ones that bring up these women\u2019s issues.

In New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur led Democratic challenger Andy Kim by 1 percentage point.\n\nIn California\u2019s 39th Congressional District, Republican Young Kim led Democrat Gil Cisneros by fewer than 3 percentage points in a race that as of Thursday morning had not been called.

We impeached President Clinton. His numbers went up and ours went down, and we underperformed in the next election.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the Democrats in the House will have to decide just how much presidential harassment they think is a good strategy,\u201d McConnell added. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure it\u2019ll work for them.\u201d\n\nDemocrats will make their own governing decisions regardless of his recommendation, said McConnell, who added that he was just making a \u201chistorical observation\u201d that the GOP\u2019s investigations of Clinton \u201cimproved the president\u2019s approval rating and tanked ours.\u201d\n\nThough Democrats did not win control of the House in the 1998 midterm elections, they were able to stave off losses typically experienced by a sitting president's party, instead picking up five House seats.\n\nTwenty years later, as of early Wednesday morning, Democrats had picked up more than two dozen seats in the House, more than the 23 needed to take the majority, with some remaining races still not called.\n\nMcConnell's comments come as Democrats plan to use their new powers to investigate the president and his administration.\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee is one of several House panels that could seek to obtain Trump's tax returns, which he has refused to release since his presidential campaign, saying he is under audit by the IRS. According to a Democratic aide the committee \u2014 along with the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 has the ability to request a person\u2019s tax returns under the tax code.\n\nThe chairman could submit a written request to the IRS to provide the information. If the Treasury Department were to deny it, House Democrats would have to decide whether to pursue the tax returns through a legal route.

At least 300 suspected cases of Ebola have been reported in the DRC, with 265 confirmed. Of those, 151 people have died, the World Health Organization says.\n\n\u201cIn vaccinating frontline health workers against Ebola virus disease even before Uganda detects a single case, health authorities are being cautious having learnt bitter lessons from previous outbreaks,\u201d the World Health Organization said in a statement.\n\nThe vaccine, which is still technically considered experimental, will not be given to the general public, but to people who would likely be the first to examine people suspected to have Ebola infections in areas bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\u201cIt is highly likely that Uganda may import Ebola virus disease from DRC given the closeness of the current epicenter, the high population movements due to trade, social-cultural connections and easy accessibility of health services in Uganda,\u201d the WHO said.\n\nIn the DRC, more than 26,000 people have been vaccinated in a \u201cring vaccination\u201d strategy. Under this approach, all the people who have been in contact with an Ebola patient are vaccinated, and then people who have been in contact with those contacts are also vaccinated. This approach worked to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s.\n\nDespite vaccination efforts, Ebola is still spreading in eastern Congo. It\u2019s a war zone, with militant groups battling the government for control of various regions. The conflict threatens health workers trying to battle the virus.\n\n\u201cI cannot access entire villages. Not because of the unequipped terrain and unpaved dirt roads but because these villages act as front lines between the different armed groups,\u201d Dr. Eric Mukuma, a health zone coordinator for the aid group CARE, wrote in an editorial in the Guardian newspaper.\n\nSome patients have also fled treatment centers, carrying the virus with them. Fighting fear and mistrust has been a big problem for health workers in various Ebola outbreaks.\n\nEbola has popped up multiple times in Central Africa since it was first identified in 1976. The worst outbreak was in Uganda in 2000 and 2001, when 574 people were infected and 261 died. By far the worst epidemic was in West Africa in 2014-2016, when 28,000 people were infected and 11,000 died in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.\n\nEbola kills between 20 percent and 70 percent of victims, depending on the strain. There are four experimental treatments being tried out in DRC: ZMapp, a cocktail of antibodies that fight the virus; a second cocktail of antibodies called REGN-EB3; a single-antibody drug called mAb114; and an antiviral drug called remdesivir.\n\nSupportive care, including replacing fluids and electrolytes lost to diarrhea and vomiting, can also help keep patients alive.\n\nThis is the second outbreak of Ebola in Congo this year. An outbreak in the western part of the country was declared over in July, after infecting 53 people and killing 33.\n\nJust days later, the current outbreak was discovered across the vast Central African nation, in a region that has been at the heart of multiple conflicts.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The measure passed with 59.9 percent of the vote.\n\nWhile the tax is a local issue, it gained national attention after its most vocal billionaire supporter, Marc Benioff, founder and co-chief executive officer of Salesforce, began to spar on social media with other tech titans, including Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square and Twitter.\n\nBenioff, a native San Franciscan who has his name on a children\u2019s hospital in the city, donated more than $7.8 million in personal and corporate money to the campaign to pass Proposition C. He celebrated the win on Tuesday night, tweeting: \u201cThank you, San Francisco.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone involved expressed their support for helping the homeless, Dorsey and other tech titans said they did not believe Proposition C was the right way to do it.\n\nThe city\u2019s complex tax code means that Proposition C will hit financial service companies, such as Dorsey\u2019s Square and competitor Stripe, disproportionately to other large San Francisco companies.\n\nSalesforce, the largest employer in San Francisco, would pay around $10 million per year, according to estimates, while Square, which is one-third the size of Salesforce, would pay more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to pay our taxes. We just want to be treated fairly with respect to our peer companies, many of whom are 2-10x larger than us,\u201d Dorsey wrote on Oct. 19. \u201cOtherwise we don\u2019t know how to practically grow in the city. That\u2019s heartbreaking for us as we love SF and want to continue to help build it.\u201d\n\nWith Proposition C getting the thumbs up from voters, companies with more than $50 million in gross annual receipts will now be taxed on any gross annual receipt revenue in San Francisco. The city already has a gross receipts tax, which is usually calculated by taking a company's global revenue and multiplying it by an \"apportionment percentage,\" which is based on their business category. Depending on their category, businesses could pay an additional tax of between .175 percent to .69 percent.\n\nPatrick Collison, co-founder and CEO of Stripe, called Proposition C \u201cwell intentioned\u201d but said it \u201ccomes with no systemic changes or effective accountability.\u201d\n\nEven the city\u2019s mayor, London Breed, who ran on a platform of solving homelessness, opposed Proposition C due to the lack of accountability and controls available in her office.\n\nFunding for homeless services has \u201cincreased dramatically in recent years with no discernible improvement in conditions,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cBefore we double the tax bill overnight, San Franciscans deserve accountability for the money they are already paying.\u201d", "Get the Better newsletter.\n\nBy Stephanie Mansour\n\nThe holidays are swiftly approaching. And after digging into your kid's Halloween stash and treating yourself to a pumpkin spice latte your taste buds are primed for a season of fun.\n\nAre you hoping to come out the other side of the holiday season without some extra baggage? While we've all heard the scary claims that the the average weight gain this season is upwards of 10 pounds, studies show that it\u2019s more like one pound if you\u2019re not already overweight (and closer to five if you\u2019re already overweight). But what\u2019s more disheartening is how long it takes to lose it: one study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that it can take more than five months, which means we are still haunted by our holiday choices come bathing suit season \u2014 if you lose it at all (which unfortunately, many of us don't.)\n\nWe get it: between holiday parties, cookie trays in the office and less-than-healthy favorites making a frequent appearance on the menu, it feels like we\u2019re set up for failure. What\u2019s more, in addition to all of the tempting treats we have to navigate over the next few months, our schedule becomes increasingly packed with errands, social obligations and end-of-year deadlines at work, meaning fitness is often pushed to the back burner.\n\nLuckily, there are some ways to squeeze in a workout (and burn off some of those extra calories) that don\u2019t require carving a ton of extra time out of your busy schedule. Case in point: this kitchen workout.\n\nMade up of exercises that will help build muscle and burn fat (all while cooking up your favorite holiday dishes), this full-body workout will help get you through the holidays the same weight you entered it.\n\nGliding Side Lunge\n\nEquipment: a paper plate\n\nHow-to: Put your right foot onto a paper plate on a hard surfaced floor. Glide the right foot out to the right, bending the knee and keeping the left leg straight. Press down through the right heel to pull the leg back to center, working the inner thigh. As you glide out, you\u2019re working the right outer hip, glute and thigh. As you glide in, you\u2019re engaging your core and your inner thighs for a full-lower body workout move! Repeat 10 times on each leg.\n\nAb Attack\n\nEquipment: 2 paper plates\n\nHow-to: Drop into a plank position with each foot on top of a paper plate. Pull the abs in and bring the right foot diagonally across your body so that your right knee is coming up towards your left shoulder. Return to the starting position, and bring the left knee and foot across the body diagonally. Repeat 10 times per leg.\n\nSpooning Push Up\n\nEquipment: a spoon\n\nHow-to: Come down into a plank position with a spoon in front of you. Pick up the spoon with the right hand so that you\u2019re in a one-arm plank. Hold for three seconds, then put the spoon down and do a mini push-up. Next, pick up the spoon with the left hand and hold for three seconds. Put the spoon down and do a mini-push up. Repeat 5 times on each side.\n\nCross Body Milk Balance\n\nEquipment: a half-gallon of milk\n\nHow-to: Stand up and grab your milk jug. Go back into the side lunge (this time without the paper plate underneath your foot!) and reach the milk down to the right. Come back through center, bring the right knee up, and lift the milk up overhead. Repeat 10 times to the right, and then switch sides.\n\nCalf Raises\n\nEquipment: none\n\nHow-to: While stirring your gravy or sauce, get ready to work the lower legs and your balance. Standing upright, simply come up onto your tip toes and then lower down. Even doing this 20 times for 3 repetitions will help sculpt the lower legs and build joint stability around the ankles!\n\nOven Squats\n\nEquipment: none\n\nHow-to: When you\u2019re taking things in and out of the oven, turn this into an obstacle course for yourself. Once the timer goes off, do 10 squats before taking the dish out of the oven. Similarly, before you put a pan into the oven, make a deal with yourself to do 10 squats first. On average, if you do 100 squats in about 5 minutes you\u2019ll burn almost 50 calories!\n\nMicrowave Side Raises\n\nEquipment: none\n\nHow-to: While waiting for corn or vegetables to heat up in the microwave, stand up tall and lift one leg out to the side and do some leg raises. This will work your gluteus medius, an important part of your core and a stabilizer for your legs that\u2019s often neglected. You\u2019ll also help to firm your booty on the side of the hip to get a nice, well-rounded glute. Do this 10 times on one side, and then repeat on the other side.\n\nTa-da! In the same amount of time it takes to cook up dinner for your family, you've also checked a workout off your to-do list!\n\nTRY THESE FITNESS ROUTINES\n\nWant more tips like these?

Markus Schreiber / AP\n\n\"What better answer is there than that, in this very city, the students of the Jewish school from Berlin should jointly pray and light candles showing that the answer to darkness and the evil of the past is to create education for the present and the future,\" he said.\n\nEighty years ago this week, on Nov. 9, 1938, the Nazis killed at least 91 people, burned down hundreds of synagogues, vandalized and looted 7,500 Jewish businesses, and arrested up to 30,000 Jewish men, many of whom were taken away to concentration camps.\n\nOn Wednesday, students assembled under a maple tree in front of their school building. They prayed in Hebrew and German and lit six white candles to commemorate the synagogues that were burned down, as well as the 6 million people who perished in the Holocaust.\n\n\"I lost a big part of my family ... my great-grandparents, their siblings, and therefore it is all very special for me,\" said 15-year-old student Clara Eljaschewitsch. \"It is sad ...

Now, he'll be overseeing it, as a Department of Justice spokeswoman essentially confirmed in a Wednesday statement.\n\nUp until now, that oversight role was performed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein because Sessions recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMueller would most likely submit a report upon the completion of the investigation to Whitaker, if he remains in his position. It is not known whether that report will be provided to Congress or made available to the public, and Whitaker could simply decline to provide anyone with the report.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, soon-to-be in Democratic control, could subpoena the report and anyone involved in preparing it, however.\n\nFor much of the past two months prior to Wednesday, Mueller's probe into Russian electoral interference and possible ties between Trump's campaign and Moscow went quiet, as had been expected. Department of Justice guidelines recommend not taking any law enforcement actions within 60 days of an election to avoid influencing voters or even giving the appearance of swaying them.\n\nThe battle most observers were paying attention to prior to the relatively quiet period involved whether Trump will sit for an interview with Mueller. That fight is now almost certain to ratchet up once again.\n\nIn August, Trump's lawyers were already preparing a memo to oppose a subpoena from Mueller, which the special counsel could serve to compel the president to sit down for such an interview.\n\n\"We would move to quash the subpoena,\" Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told The Washington Post at the time. \"And we're pretty much finished with our memorandum opposing a subpoena.\"\n\nSuch a back-and-forth could set off a monumental legal fight in federal court, possibly going all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe discussion of a possible subpoena came as both sides continued an extended back-and-forth over the conditions for an interview. The issue, as Giuliani has made clear in multiple interviews, involves whether Trump will answer any questions on potential obstruction of justice regarding the ongoing Russia probe and if the president will provide Mueller with written answers or will sit for an interview.\n\nTrump's legal team wants the questioning to focus exclusively on possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia and not delve into obstruction. They have also stated their preference for written answers by Trump to Mueller's questions.\n\nTrump's lawyers, however, have long cautioned the president against providing Mueller with any interview whatsoever, saying that the former FBI director may lure him into a perjury trap.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, Trump said he would \"probably\" agree to answer some of Mueller's questions after the election.\n\nLast week, CNN reported that Trump has started to review with his legal team the answers he plans to provide to Mueller's written questions, though no determination has been made about the president sitting with the special counsel for an in-person interview. CNN also noted that Mueller's team has started to write its final report.\n\nAndrew Wright, who was associate counsel to President Barack Obama, told NBC News that it would make sense for a Trump interview to be among the last steps Mueller takes in the investigation before completing a report on his findings.\n\n\"I would expect that to come to pass at the end of the process, if (the interview) happens,\" Wright said, noting that investigators prefer to interview a key figure like Trump after they've completed all of their other investigatory work.\n\nMeanwhile, there were some developments to come out of the Mueller investigation during the two-month quiet period.\n\nIn September, Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort \u2014 a central figure in the investigation \u2014 reached a plea deal with Mueller. Manafort is set to be sentenced in February.\n\nAnd just last week, NBC News and The New York Times reported on how longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and right-wing conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi have found themselves at the center of the investigation. NBC News reported that Mueller's office obtained communications that suggested Corsi, whom Mueller subpoenaed in September, may have had advance knowledge that emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta were stolen and provided to WikiLeaks.\n\nStone says he only passed along information already in the public domain, now insisting he never provided the campaign with inside information about the Podesta emails ahead of their publication.\n\nRenato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told NBC News he expects Mueller to ramp up his efforts regarding Stone following the election.\n\n\"It appears to me that Mueller is closing in on Stone, interviewing witnesses close to him,\" Mariotti said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if Stone is indicted soon. Based on his public statements, Stone wouldn't be surprised either.\"\n\nSince his investigation began last year, Mueller has filed more than 100 criminal charges against 32 individuals. The special counsel has secured guilty pleas or convictions from every U.S. person charged as a result of the probe.\n\nThat includes former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who cooperated with prosecutors and is set to be sentenced next month, and former Trump campaign advisers Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. Mueller has also charged 13 Russian nationals and 12 Russian intelligence officers with crimes including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to commit an offense against the U.S.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Rebecca Shabad\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After eight years in the minority, Democrats are set to regain control of the House in January, bringing divided government \u2014 and ambitious oversight \u2014 back to a deeply polarized Washington.\n\nUnlike the last time they held the levers of power in the lower chamber, they won't have a Democratic Senate or president to help turn their legislative dreams into reality. What they will have: very real subpoena power \u2014 and a long list of potential executive branch targets.\n\nWhen they assume the majority early next year, Democrats are planning to make up for lost time on both fronts \u2014 though some of the most ambitious items on their agenda are likely to run into a few reality-based roadblocks.\n\nThey'll be introducing a wave of policy proposals demonstrating the party's priorities on a range of issues, despite the vanishingly small odds that the GOP-controlled Senate would take up any of the bills \u2014 and even smaller odds that President Donald Trump would sign them into law.\n\nMore concretely, they'll be flexing their new investigative muscles with a focus on ethical questions swirling around the president, his finances, and multiple members of his Cabinet \u2014 even though they're likely to face legal battles and other pushback that may significantly slow or even stop the progress of some of their highest-priority likely probes.\n\nEven so, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is expected to become the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said that he wants to make sure no stone was left unturned in the GOP\u2019s investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nOther committees \u2014 including Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary and Ways and Means \u2014 are also expected to pursue investigations into the administration.\n\nThe expected chairman of Judiciary, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., told MSNBC's Ari Melber Tuesday night that \"all options are on the table\" if Trump tries to \"sabotage\" the Russia probe or fires \"key people\" or abuses the pardon power.\n\n\"We\u2019ll use subpoena power if we have to, when we have to,\" he said.\n\nAnd Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., expected to become chairman of the Oversight panel, plans to look into the administration\u2019s immigration and child separation policies, financial conflicts of interest, possible violations of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, and voter suppression efforts, to name just a few entries on a long list of potential targets.\n\nThe first step in that process: staffing up a new investigative army. In 2011, for example, the number of Republican staff members on the Oversight Committee quickly shot from 40 to 80.\n\n\u201cOur staff doubled overnight,\u201d said Kurt Bardella, who served as deputy communications director and senior adviser to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., when he led the Oversight Committee in 2011. \u201cYou really can\u2019t underestimate the amount of manpower you really get when you\u2019re in the majority for this particular committee, which enables you to conduct five, six, seven, eight investigations simultaneously.\u201d\n\nWays and Means is one of several committees that could seek to obtain President Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has refused to release since his presidential campaign, saying he is under audit by the IRS. According to a Democratic aide the committee \u2014 along with the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 has the ability to request a person\u2019s tax returns under the tax code.\n\nThe chairman could submit a written request to the IRS to provide the information. If the Treasury Department were to deny it, House Democrats would have to decide whether to pursue the tax returns through a legal route. If they are obtained, the chairman would have to designate the panel\u2019s members as \u201cagents\u201d to read the returns. They would then have to vote to make the documents public and report them to the full House.\n\nIt would be far from an easy win: The process, once launched, could drag on for months, or even longer. Publicly, Trump has downplayed any concern over the prospect. \"I don't care. They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want,\" he said Monday of the idea of a drawn-out battle for his tax returns.\n\nHowever that fight plays out, Democratic leadership has pledged its full support for the general idea of aggressive investigations. Impeachment is another story.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, many Democrats avoided discussing the possibility \u2014 which, if it were acted on in the House, would likely be politically dead on arrival in the Senate. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., publicly dismissed it as \u201cnot a priority\u201d for her party.\n\nWhile Pelosi, 78, will have to formally be re-elected as speaker of the House, she has repeatedly expressed confidence that she will retake the gavel despite some dissatisfied members who want a new leader.\n\nRumblings over the last year of a potential challenge to Pelosi for speaker again if Democrats won the House were driven in large part by a relatively small group of Democrats running in predominantly GOP districts. (Asked Tuesday night if she had a message for any candidates in that group who had won election, Pelosi said only: \"Congratulations on winning.\")\n\nHouse Democrats have planned to hold leadership elections for their caucus the week after Thanksgiving, which will be when House Democrats will vote to decide whether to re-elect Pelosi as their leader, paving the way for her to likely win the speakership in January when they hold the formal vote on the floor. And unless there are challenges from other members, the current ranking members on committees will likely become the chairs.\n\nThe dynamic on Capitol Hill between the two parties will in many ways mirror that after the Republican takeover of the House in 2011, which guarantees one thing: even more gridlock. At the time, Democrats controlled both the White House and Senate and there was only so much lawmakers were able to achieve as the GOP took a series of effectively symbolic votes to dismantle Obamacare and cripple more of President Barack Obama\u2019s policy initiatives.\n\nBack then, the new GOP majority came with a new set of headaches: a rebellious group of conservatives who didn\u2019t always stand behind GOP leadership. Democrats are wary of encountering their own internal divisions \u2014 between the more establishment-oriented and more progressive wings of the party \u2014 as they prepare to shape their message ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to be united in the minority than it is to be in the majority,\u201d said Nadeam Elshami, who served as chief of staff and senior communications adviser to Pelosi when she served as speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011.\n\nHouse Democrats waded through internal divisions in 2007 as they debated whether to fund the war in Iraq and the caucus was \u201cabsolutely split,\u201d Elshami recalled, which led to a rift with President George W. Bush early on after the Democratic-controlled congress passed an emergency spending bill saying that the U.S. had to leave Iraq by a certain date.\n\n\u201cThe president vetoed that bill,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, off the bat, it wasn\u2019t a very good relationship.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who chaired the House Financial Services Committee at the time, remembers that while he experienced bipartisanship in the beginning, it didn\u2019t last long. One of the first major bills he shepherded through his committee was a measure to outlaw bad subprime mortgages and the committee\u2019s senior Republican, Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., voted for the bill along with several other GOP members.\n\n\u201cThe reaction of the other Republicans on the committee was fury, and after [Bachus] cooperated with us in passing the bill, he was threatened with the loss of his position as ranking member \u2014 and from then on, I got no cooperation from any of the Republicans,\u201d Frank said.\n\nA similar dynamic is sure to return next year, with some newly-minted members of the Democratic majority unlikely to be in a mood to hand the president any easy political wins \u2014 even in areas where their priorities might appear to have some overlap.\n\nDemocrats, for instance, are expected to reintroduce their Better Deal legislative plan that includes proposals to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, both of which have been policy goals touted by Trump. They'll also be looking to enhance election security and reduce the role of money in politics, which Pelosi recently said would be their first piece of legislation.\n\nWhile they\u2019ll put these proposals forward, there will be only so much they\u2019ll be able to accomplish with President Trump in the White House and a GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 an approach more likely to lend itself to symbolic votes than actual law.\n\nTechnically, leaders from both parties have expressed a willingness to reach bipartisan deals. In reality, the energy to reach them will be limited, especially when Democrats begin to flex their new investigative muscle.\n\nThen there's the baggage of Trump's own history in talks on the Hill, which has been littered with false starts and failed negotiations \u2014 meaning the most concrete action out of the new Congress is likely to come in probes of the Trump White House, not compromise with it.\n\nInfrastructure, which fell by the wayside in the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, has been mentioned as one area with the potential, however remote, for cooperation. House Democrats will likely reintroduce the infrastructure plan that they outlined earlier this year, calling for an investment of $1 trillion to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, transit, rail, schools and water systems. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has already gotten a head start by recently meeting with White House legislative director Shahira Knight to discuss ideas.\n\nBut Republicans \u2014 who retain control of the lower chamber for the next several weeks \u2014 still have a shot at boosting their own agenda, with one last chance next month to provide significant funding for the president\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border during his first term. Of course, Senate Democrats, who have blocked border wall funding so far this term, are likely to do the same late this year.\n\nAnd so the Democratic goal of derailing Trump policies such as hard-line immigration proposals and efforts to further roll back environmental regulations will take center stage. Come January, the new House reality is that concrete policy action is less likely to involve advancing Democratic goals than it is blocking the president's priorities.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

She works out. He makes his own yogurt. And the cherry on top: she tutors disadvantaged 2nd-graders twice a week.\n\nWhat\u2019s her secret? Experts say it might in fact be that time your friend sets aside for volunteering.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of work on the benefits of volunteering, probably because in some ways it\u2019s sort of the perfect activity,\u201d says Nancy Morrow-Howell, MSW, PhD, director of the Harvey A. Friedman Center for Aging and a professor of social policy at Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis, who researches the health benefits of volunteering.\n\n\u201cIt seems to produce health for the volunteer. And it\u2019s contributing to the greater social good, because generally volunteers are working with organizations on some sort of social mission,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\n\nStudies have linked volunteering with better mental health, including more life satisfaction, having a stronger sense of purpose, having greater self-esteem, having a sense of increased personal control, having less social isolation, having slower cognitive decline, and showing fewer depressive symptoms.\n\nAnd evidence suggests volunteering has benefits for physical health, too.\n\nA 2013 study analyzed data from 1,654 individuals who participated in the 2006 and 2010 waves of the national Health and Retirement Study that asked questions about volunteering and measured participants\u2019 blood pressure when the survey was conducted and four years later. Controlling for things like age, gender, ethnicity, education and other factors, the individuals who reported volunteering at least 200 hours in the 12 months leading up to the survey had a 40 percent lower risk of having high blood pressure four years later than those that had volunteered less.\n\n(In these types of studies \u201cvolunteering\u201d is usually defined as some sort of service or helping activity done in a discretionary way outside of the home organized by an agency, Morrow-Howell says.)\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter works with other volunteers on a Habitat for Humanity project. Robert Franklin / South Bend Tribune via AP\n\nTo date, we\u2019re not aware of studies linking volunteering with yogurt-making ability. But the point is that volunteering may increase well-being overall because it usually increases activity across the board, from physical activity to social activity to cognitive activity, Morrow-Howell says.\n\nAnd other evidence suggests that being engaged in all of those different areas promotes both physical and emotional health, she adds.\n\nDifferent roles, of course, are more socially engaging than others. Others are more cognitively challenging or physically stimulating. You\u2019ll get something out of each of those roles. But the theory would suggest that the more the work covers all of those bases (keeping you moving, socially engaged and mentally challenged), the more benefit you might (theoretically) get.\n\nUnfortunately finding such an opportunity that checks all of those boxes and fits into your schedule may not be straightforward to find. But it\u2019s certainly not impossible, Morrow-Howell and others say.\n\nWhen it comes to volunteering, too much choice may be counterproductive\n\nGoogle \u201cvolunteer opportunities\u201d and you\u2019ll likely come across several national and local opportunities or resources that help place volunteers.\n\nThose resources can be great for connecting rising volunteers with projects that fit their schedule and need them, Morrow-Howell says. But for some the sheer volume of choice can be overwhelming.\n\n(In New York City, for example, someone can search volunteer projects by day of the week, time of day, subway line, and type of work, using certain databases. It\u2019s great for finding that project that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re looking for \u2014 as long as you know exactly what you\u2019re looking for to begin with.)\n\nBehavioral economics theory pretty clearly shows that to help people make better choices more easily, don\u2019t overwhelm people with choices, Morrow-Howell explains. \u201cWe do just the opposite in volunteering. We throw a ga-zillion options at people thinking that everybody needs a lot of choice.\u201d\n\nAnd while it\u2019s good to give volunteers choices that make volunteering their time and energy convenient, it\u2019s also important to recognize that that much choice can overwhelm people and make it harder to find something that truly resonates, Morrow-Howell says.\n\n5 tips for finding volunteer work that doesn\u2019t feel anything like work\n\nThe point is \u2014 especially if you find yourself wanting to volunteer your time but having trouble finding something that you can stick with \u2014 maybe changing your tactics could help. Here are a few tips from Morow-Howell and others:\n\n1. Do it with a friend\n\nThat same decision-making theory that says we get overwhelmed by too many choices says that people are much more likely to do something if others around around them are participating, says Morrow-Howell. That means you\u2019ll be much more motivated to actually leave the office early for that youth mentoring program if you\u2019re headed out with a co-worker or meeting a friend there.\n\n2. Start small, go slow and let it grow\n\nDon\u2019t jump into a thrice-a-week commitment right away, Morrow-Howell says. Volunteer a day at a time, going back because you want to. As you develop relationships with the people there, more opportunities to get more involved will likely show up more naturally (and you may find the time commitment doesn\u2019t seem so overwhelming).\n\n3. Find a cause you care about\n\nIf you care about the cause you\u2019re giving back to, you\u2019re much more likely to feel good about the time you\u2019re donating and keep doing it, says Victoria King, Community Outreach Coordinator with Volunteers of America in the Southeast Louisiana region.\n\nFinding something meaningful can be as easy as identifying skills and abilities that you can bring to the table, along with a group or organization that needs those things, King says. \u201cKey is finding someone that needs what you have to offer,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd speaking of what you have to offer\u2026\n\n4. Do something you love\n\nAre you a musician? Is there somewhere you can donate your time and skill (like a local senior center)? Do you love to cook? Is there a local soup kitchen that might need help? \u201cThe extent to which a role is very engaging, fulfilling and purposeful to a person is important,\u201d Morrow-Howell says.\n\n5. Check local websites and national ones\n\nHere\u2019s where those volunteer matching programs and huge databases (like Volunteers of America or VolutneerMatch) may be helpful. If you have an activity in mind, a resource that can connect you to an organization or group of people who might benefit from your skills may be extremely helpful.\n\nBut if you can, try a few different opportunities out to figure out which one is the best fit, Morrow-Howell says.\n\nMORE FROM BETTER\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Source: Kaiser Health News By Julie Rovner, Kaiser Health News\n\nHealth care proved important but apparently not pivotal in the 2018 midterm elections on Tuesday as voters gave Democrats control of the U.S. House, left Republicans in charge in the Senate and appeared to order an expansion of Medicaid in at least three states long controlled by Republicans.\n\nIn taking over the House, Democrats are unlikely to be able to advance many initiatives when it comes to health policy, given the GOP\u2019s control of the Senate and White House. But they will be able to deliver an effective veto to Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, convert the Medicaid health care system for low-income people into a block grant program and make major changes to Medicare.\n\nOne likely development is an expansion of Medicaid in several of the 18 states that had so far not offered coverage made available by the Affordable Care Act. Early returns showed voters in Utah, Nebraska and Idaho easily approving ballot measures calling for expansion.\n\nIn Montana, voters are deciding if the existing expansion should be continued and the state\u2019s expenses covered by raising tobacco taxes. In preliminary results, opponents outnumbered supporters but key counties were not expected to release their tallies until Wednesday.\n\nMedicaid might also be expanded in Kansas, where Democratic candidate for governor Laura Kelly defeated GOP Secretary of State Kris Kobach. The Kansas legislature had previously passed Medicaid expansion, but it was vetoed in 2017 by former GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Kobach had not supported the ACA expansion.\n\nAnd in Maine, where voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017 but GOP Gov. Paul LePage refused to implement it, Democrat Janet Mills was victorious. She has promised to follow the voters\u2019 wishes. LePage was not running.\n\nIn exit polling, as in many earlier surveys in 2018, voters said that health care, particularly preserving protections for people with preexisting conditions, was their top issue. But health care remained more important to Democrats than to Republicans.\n\nThose who urged Democrats to emphasize health care this year took credit for the congressional successes. \u201cThe race for the House was a referendum on the Republican war on health care. You know it, I know it, and the Republican incumbents who shamefully tried to cover up their real record on health care and lost their seats know it,\u201d said Brad Woodhouse of the advocacy group Protect Our Care.\n\nBut the issue was not enough to save some of the Senate Democrats in states won by President Donald Trump in 2016. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., was defeated by GOP Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is a plaintiff in a key lawsuit seeking to declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., who also campaigned hard on health care, were defeated.\n\nNonetheless, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., beat Republican Patrick Morrisey, the state\u2019s attorney general who is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to upend the ACA.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the leader of the House Democrats who is poised to take over as speaker, told supporters gathered in Washington for a victory celebration that her caucus would make health care a key legislative issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about stopping the GOP and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell\u2019s assault on Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and the health care of 130 million Americans living with preexisting medical conditions,\u201d she said.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Alex Seitz-Wald and Benjy Sarlin\n\nDemocrats won the House in a wave, while Republicans outperformed expectations in the Senate, leaving political observers scrambling to figure out what it all means.\n\nBut, as the results came in, some clear implications emerged for the future. Dozens of theories of how to win were tested by both parties. Some worked, some didn't. And the shockingly high turnout offered seeds of hope to both sides that their coalition may be durable for 2020.\n\nHere's what the results tell us so far:\n\n1. The Trump effect is real\n\nThere were two broad schools of thought on 2016: Either Donald Trump was a fluke president who only won by drawing an unpopular opponent, the divine intervention of James Comey and a complacent Democratic base \u2014 or he was a singular figure who had fundamentally reshaped the electorate.\n\nTuesday offered a boost to the latter theory, with some positive results for his party amid a whole lot of negative ones.\n\nNo one could say voters were caught off guard this time. Turnout soared in comparison to prior midterms. And once again, many of the trends that helped elect Trump, even as he lost the popular vote, held true.\n\nJust like in 2016, rural voters in 2018 turned out in droves to elect Senate candidates in states Trump won, like Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and even purple Florida.\n\nBut, in another echo of 2016, Trump did catastrophic damage to Republicans in the suburbs, long a traditional source of strength for the GOP. From Fairfax, Virginia, to Dallas, Texas, these angry voters made it clear early that Democrats would capture the House, even with a map whose gerrymandered lines strongly favored Republicans.\n\nThe wild card for the president is the Rust Belt and Midwest \u2014 the \"blue wall\" that Trump smashed in 2016 \u2014 which sent mixed messages on Tuesday night, with Democratic senators winning easily, House challengers picking up key seats and parties splitting governor races. Expect it to be a major battleground moving forward.\n\n2. It\u2019s not the economy, stupid\n\nWhat may be the most unusual aspect of the midterm cycle is that voters overwhelmingly backed Democrats in the House even with unemployment low and wages growing.\n\nIn exit polls, 41 percent of voters cited health care as the most important issue, which Democrats universally emphasized in races, while 23 percent named immigration, which Trump focused on in the final weeks. Just 21 percent named the economy, the only time in at least a decade that it hasn't topped the list, and a significant 11 percent named gun policies. Two-thirds said the president was important to their vote, either to show their support or opposition.\n\nPrior waves have usually been easy to explain. Either the economy was performing poorly (2010), a major war was going badly (2006), or the White House was laid low by scandal (1974). Trump has seen enough scandals for several presidents, but they played a surprisingly minimal role in Democratic campaigns.\n\nThat suggests other messages matter a lot more for each party, but it also raises a troubling question for Republicans: If they lose the House by a wide margin when the economy is humming, what happens if things hit a speed bump?\n\n3. The blueprint for Democrats is ... \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nDemocrats were hoping Tuesday's results would help them chart a course for the 2020 presidential race by clearly demonstrating that either mobilization (boosting turnout among liberals, minorities and other base Democratic voters) or persuasion (tacking to the center to try to win undecided voters) is the winning strategy in Trump's America.\n\nBut instead of a clear signal, they got noise, with conflicting data that is sure to be cherry-picked by both wings of the party to argue the superiority of their side.\n\nOn one hand, some of the highest-profile progressive candidates in the country \u2014 like Randy \"Ironstache\" Bryce running for Speaker Paul Ryan's empty seat, Beto O'Rouke in Texas and Kara Eastman in Nebraska \u2014 went down to defeat.\n\nOn the other hand, so did some of the highest-profile moderate candidates. Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., who cut TV ads attacking \"the radical left,\u201d got crushed, losing by about 9 points. That's the same margin that Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is on track to lose by. O'Rouke actually came closer to winning than either of them, losing by only about 3 percentage points.\n\nFlorida offers a neat example of the muddled picture: Gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who touted support from Bernie Sanders and campaigned on marijuana legalization, finished with an almost identical losing margin to Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who campaigned as a nice-guy moderate former astronaut.\n\n4. Divided government, get used to it\n\nIt's never too early to start thinking about the next election and 2020 will be about more than just the presidential race.\n\nFirst, there's the Senate. If Democrats had held onto a few more seats this year, even if it wasn't enough to win control of the upper chamber, they would be in a better position to retake the Senate in 2020, when they'll compete in a more favorable set of races. But now, they'll face a much steeper climb.\n\nThen there's redistricting, the once-a-decade process where states redraw the boundaries of legislative and congressional districts, which will happen again following the 2020 census. Republicans have been able to hold the House largely thanks to effective gerrymandering after \"Democrats picked a bad night to have a bad night\" in 2010, as Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez likes to say.\n\nWhile full state-level results remain to be seen, and there's another election before the map-drawing process kicks in, Democrats missed opportunities to install friendly governors in key states Tuesday, such as Ohio and Florida, which will now have Republican governors in 2020.\n\n5. Political gravity still exists\n\nTrump has been a consistently unpopular president since almost the moment he took office, but his upset win in 2016 and the failure of state polls to see it coming created the impression that he'd devised a new formula that defied all past political logic.\n\nSure, things looked bad for his approval ratings, but they sure didn't look great when he was caught on tape boasting about groping women, or when he mocked POWs, or when he made what Speaker Paul Ryan called \"the textbook definition of a racist comment\" about a Hispanic federal judge. These impressions only hardened when his approval rating, however low, seemed to stay stable no matter what chaos was dominating the news or which former aide was pleading guilty to serious crimes.\n\nAll of this led many to throw their arms up with a cry of \"nothing matters\" and assume so-called experts had nothing to offer on how politics works in 2018.\n\nBut polling and conventional wisdom \u2014 that Democrats would win the House, but lose the Senate \u2014 ended up being spot on. It turned out that a president who enters Election Day with a 44 percent approval rating still suffers major losses, just like presidents with similar ratings had before him.\n\nDemocrats lost more Senate seats than many predicted, with Florida being the big surprise, and won some House seats no one saw coming, including shock races in Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Trump-friendly Staten Island.\n\nBut in general, the pundits got this one right and Trump now looks more mortal than his opponents had initially believed.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy David Brock\n\nThe results of this midterm election signaled a rejection of Trump's ugly, intemperate and divisive brand of political warfare. But the repudiation of the president is not a mandate for House Democrats to impeach him \u2014 and acting like it is will imperil both the tenuous majority in the House and the party's hopes of retaking the White House.\n\nHistory shows us as much: I was a proud acolyte of Newt Gingrich in 1994, when he engineered a historic takeover of the House on the basis of the so-called Contract with America, which extolled such policy prescriptions as lower taxes and tort and welfare reform.\n\nShortly after taking control of the House, however, Republicans adopt a scorched-earth strategy of hounding Bill Clinton with empty Congressional investigations and scandal-mongering, including Travelgate, Filegate, Vincent Foster's suicide and, of course, Whitewater.\n\nBut that's not why voters elected Republicans to lead, and Clinton cruised to re-election in 1996. in the 1998 midterms \u2014 widely seen as a referendum on Clinton's impeachment, which had little to do with the scandals Republicans had initially drummed up \u2014 Democrats defied history and actually gained seats. Snarling Senators like Al D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who had become the face of the GOP, ended up losing their seats.\n\nDemocrats and the country cannot afford to let history repeat itself, no matter how much they detest the president. Democrats ran on a winning message of issues front and center in voters lives, like health care \u2014 not impeachment. Pursuing impeachment now, which will necessarily come at the expense of everything else on the agenda for which they won, would allow Trump and his surrogates to credibly portray the entire party as a subpoena-happy and solely interested in obstruction.\n\nIf they follow the path carved out by Republicans after 1994, easily-caricatured Democratic committee chairmen \u2014 who may well hail from the liberal coasts \u2014 would dominate the cable airwaves bashing the president rather than promoting the policies that got them elected, which is not a good look for the independent swing voters that Democrats will need to regain the White House in 2020. And every candidate for the party's presidential nomination would be constantly pushed by the news media to comment on the matter of impeachment, rather than differentiating themselves from Trump on the basis of their policies.\n\nDemocrats can, of course, claim something of a mandate to bring a measure of accountability and transparency to a Trump administration that has brazenly operated for two years with none. Voters have clearly turned on the rubber-stamp yes men, many of whom were decisively defeated.\n\nBut Democrats should focus on policy disagreements and ostentatious malfeasance, not personal peccadilloes, in choosing their investigatory targets. Fruitful areas of inquiry include Trump's botched \"zero tolerance\" border enforcement initiative, conflicts of interest with lobbyists entering the administration and public corruption by Trump's cabinet members.\n\nMeanwhile while continuing to stand up for the Affordable Care Act, Democrats should reach across the aisle to pass an infrastructure bill and move on criminal justice reform; voters want the parties to work together on some things, after all. Then, if they really want to help assure victory in 2020, they should definitively focus on key issues that have come to define this election for many voters, pushing for changes to campaign finance and ethics laws, outlawing the gerrymandering of congressional districts and restoring enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe one caveat to this advice hinges on the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election by special counsel Robert Mueller. If Mueller \u2014 by all accounts a careful prosecutor \u2014 does in fact send a report to Congress identifying slam-dunk impeachable offenses by the president, Congress will be obliged to discharge its constitutional duty. But Democrats should resist the urge to pounce and wait until the facts are in and, if they aren't quite the game-winners some have assumed, not drum up an impeachment trial on minor issues \u2014 which is what Republicans did with Clinton in 1998, thereby losing both the trial and, in many cases, the election.\n\nIf Democrats in Congress, succumbing to pent-up frustration within the base, go down the impeachment road prematurely it will be at all of our political peril. Aping the president's message of radical dissent, disunity and destruction which hardly served him well on Tuesday won't serve the Democrats well going into 2020 \u2014 and Republicans proved that to themselves in the 1990s.", "Tony Evers claims victory over two-term Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker copied!\n\nDemocrat Tony Evers told supporters, \u201cI'm going to be the next governor of the state of Wisconsin,\u201d denying Republican Scott Walker a third term.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

And it was just a taste of what his re-election bid will look like.\n\nThat's because Trump drew a simple lesson from Tuesday's midterms: He's on the right track. Sources close to and inside the White House said Tuesday night that the president felt validated by the results.\n\nEarlier this year, he launched a brash plan to rally his own supporters to the Republican cause by staging a series of high-voltage rallies, mostly in deep-red corners of GOP strongholds with competitive Senate races.\n\nIt was the way in which he could be most useful to GOP candidates at a time when his mere presence in tight House districts could tilt them away from Republican incumbents, but it also fit well with his raw and uncompromising style.\n\n\"Trump disappearing from the scene is literally not a viable option, so you might as well use him and get the best benefit from him,\" said a former Trump White House official.\n\nHe played to voters' fears and anger \u2014 over the prospect of impeachment, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings and caravans of immigrants. He demonized Democrats as a \"party of crime\" and \"evil people.\" And he rejected calls from fellow Republicans to focus on their shared economic record rather than sending troops to the southern border and trying to rewrite the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship.\n\nHis critics in the Republican Party believe his strategy and tactics hurt GOP candidates outside of Trump territory, and may continue to do so for years to come. That may be one of the reasons Democrats seized control of the House for the first time in eight years. But Trump can credibly claim that he'd achieved his goal of safeguarding the Republican majority in the Senate despite the House loss.\n\nIn his mind, he was right and they were wrong. And his loyalists don't see him altering his formula.\n\n\"Trump is who he is,\" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and a close Trump ally.\n\nRepublicans were relieved Tuesday night that they were not swept away by a \"blue wave\" of Democratic victories that his rivals had hoped for. But the Democratic takeover of the House, which was carried out in suburbs and exurbs across the country, held some warning signs for the party.\n\nAfter all, most Americans think the country is on the wrong track and don't approve of the job Trump is doing. Beyond that, some Republican strategists say, the president's dark rhetoric is permanently alienating voters who need to be courted by the GOP.\n\n\"What he\u2019s done with the racist emphasis on immigration and his general conduct, he\u2019s limited any growth among the faster-growing demographic groups in the country,\" said John Weaver, a veteran GOP strategist who advised Ohio Gov. John Kasich's Republican presidential primary campaign in 2016. \"Every day the country gets a little younger and it gets a little less white and you project that to 2020 and the math starts working dangerously against Republicans pulling off an inside straight in a presidential election.\"\n\nIn that way, Trump's base appeal echoes the course taken by Hillary Clinton, his rival for the presidency in 2016. He is focused so narrowly on trying to turn out the people who already agree with him that he may have lost the ability to persuade anyone who doesn't. The only political answer to that is to squeeze more votes out of a narrow base.\n\nBut, having invested little in party politics before he became a politician a few years ago, Trump may not care as much about the state of the GOP a decade from now as others in the party.\n\nHe just has one more election to win, and he's unlikely to change course.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Remember the grand bipartisan confab he hosted at the White House to hash out immigration back in January? \u201cI think my positions are going to be what the people in this room come up with,\u201d he said then. \u201cIf they come to me with things that I\u2019m not in love with, I\u2019m going to do it because I respect them.\u201d He thought wrong, as it turned out, and that promise vanished down a Trumpian \u201cshit hole.\u201d\n\nRemember Trump\u2019s disappearing act during the government shutdown later that month?

Even with a compliant Congress, Trump has pushed an expansive view of his powers \u2014 a personal sense the president is or should be the boss of the government (including Congress), combined with a supporting staff ideologically inclined toward an imperial executive. An example, perhaps most extremely, is his recent declaration that he could single-handedly reinterpret the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of citizenship to anyone born in this country.\n\nNow imagine what he\u2019ll do when faced with intractable gridlock and unending investigations.\n\nWe can tell a little bit of his probable leanings from the way that he and his administration conducted the closing days of the campaign, leaning in on a friendly Senate map while abandoning a House fight which most political observers wrote off. Trump will declare himself the winner of the night and the savior of a Senate that was never in real danger of turning Democratic because he campaigned for winners in states that had voted for him (never mind the Democratic survivor in West Virginia, for example).\n\nAs for the House, we\u2019ll hear from his surrogates, at least, about how hard it is to run against history; presidents\u2019 parties always lose House seats in midterm races after all. But history didn\u2019t cost the GOP control of the House and history neither forced House Republicans to appease an unpopular president. History also did not compel an odious chief executive to campaign as a merchant of fear, whipping up nationalist xenophobia while trying to wreck the health care system and then lying about all of it. (None of that was lost on the suburban voters who repudiated the president and his party.)\n\nThe Democrats simply meeting expectations may not be sexy, but we shouldn\u2019t understate the importance of doing so: One-party rule is over.\n\nThat means two critical things: First the Trump agenda as we\u2019ve known it is dead on Capitol Hill as of January; second, a blizzard of subpoenas will soon issue from the northern side of the Capitol Hill, wafting down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThe tax returns to which \u2014 contrary to tradition and basic norms of ethical government \u2014 Trump has so fiercely clung? That\u2019s \u201cone of the first things we\u2019d do,\u201d House Democratic leader (and presumptive incoming speaker?) Nancy Pelosi said in September. And that\u2019s just for starters: The Russia investigation, Trump obstruction, the intersection of public policy and Trump family finances, the cornucopia of mini-scandals that have dominated Trump\u2019s cabinet and administration \u2014 the entire carnival of corruption which not drained but gilded the swamp \u2014 will be fair game for Democratic investigators.\n\nSo how does the erratic chief executive respond? As presidents tend to do, he\u2019ll likely push the limits of his own executive powers even further.\n\nThe problem is that Trump is a glorified, overpowered version of a low-information Fox News voter with a conservative bumper-sticker grasp of policy and so he is incapable of real political deal-making. When he wanders too far off the reservation, his conservative staffers reel him back.\n\nPlus Democrats can\u2019t have forgotten what trying to deal with President Jell-O was like. They too will have limitations from their own base, and be leery that any deal-making with the president will burnish his bipartisan credentials and bolster his re-election prospects. Besides which, Trump\u2019s famously thin-skin, counter-punching instincts and impulse-control issues (especially on Twitter, where he will probably have colorful nicknames for top Democrats even before they start wielding gavels in January) all figure to make the presidential relationship with the House more, not less, fraught.\n\nThe president may think he\u2019s walking into negotiations with a Democratic-controlled House with the upper hand \u2014 as he inevitably seems to believe in every situation \u2014 but the truth is that he can\u2019t accomplish much of anything that they don\u2019t want him to achieve.

In time, they would make good on that promise, issuing more than 100 subpoenas and holding hundreds of congressional oversight hearings.\n\nFor the better part of the last two years, the House Oversight Committee has gone dormant. Republicans, it seems, abandoned their enthusiasm for oversight. Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., hasn\u2019t sent a single subpoena to the Trump administration. Never mind the fact that, in 2015, House Republicans changed their own rules to expand subpoena authority. Democrats, however, will have no such hesitation when they assume their new House majority status in January.\n\nCongressional Democrats will be under pressure from their own base to show some immediate results.

Congressional Democrats will be under pressure from their own base to show some immediate results. Luckily for them, there is no shortage of low-hanging fruit to choose from. Indeed, Trump would be wise to act now and pre-empt some of the inevitable embarrassment that will result if investigations go forward.\n\nAs it stands now, the five members of the Trump Cabinet most likely to face immediate scrutiny are Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\nFollowing former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s exit, Zinke has taken over as the most overtly corrupt Cabinet member. He is the focal point of multiple investigations regarding his travel, his wife\u2019s travel, his use of his department\u2019s resources for personal gain, a sweetheart land deal with Halliburton, his alleged abuses of power and the reported exertion of improper influence designed to block the opening of a tribe\u2019s casino. It\u2019s tough enough for someone to survive just a single inquiry, never mind surviving multiple ones.\n\nCarson is at the center of a number of controversies including the promotions and salaries of political operatives with no experience in housing policy as well as lavish government spending, which included more than $31,000 spent on a dining room set. Meanwhile, Nielsen has spent months avoiding questions from Oversight Committee Democrats about the administration\u2019s controversial child separation policy at the border. This program will face renewed scrutiny from Congressional Democrats who could force Nielsen to explain why she declared that: \u201cWe do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.\u201d\n\nDeVos has long been dogged by controversies of her own. Back in March, it was reported that White House officials were \u201calarmed\u201d by her interview with Leslie Stahl on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d in which the secretary seemed unable to answer basic questions about the country\u2019s education system. Imagine how she\u2019ll do answering questions in front of a congressional committee? If there\u2019s one thing we know about how Trump evaluates success, it\u2019s that he does so through the lens of performance. If her past performances are any indication, DeVos may not pass the Trump test.\n\nRoss, too, is now in hot water. Over the summer, watchdog groups called for investigations into the commerce secretary's financial activities and how he personally may have benefitted from administration actions he was directly involved in. Than in October it was revealed that Ross lied to Congress about the origins of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Democrats on the Oversight Committee, which has primary jurisdiction of the census, have repeated requested documents related to the census decision and called for Ross to testify before the Committee to explain the discrepancies in his previous congressional testimony.\n\nHonestly, given the many potential targets, the biggest challenge for Democrats will be patience. Democrats must resist the impulse to initiate a blitzkrieg of hearings, subpoenas and investigations. Such a move would be a mistake. The best kind of oversight is conducted in methodical, deliberate and substantive manner \u2014 something Oversight Republicans did not always remember during the Obama years.\n\nZinke, Carson, Nielsen, DeVos and Ross represent the Democrats\u2019 best opportunity to expose incompetence and corruption in the upper levels of Trump\u2019s White House. And politically, it will be important to get some points on the scoreboard, especially since the Senate will remain in Republican control. Shining some light into the darker corners of Trump\u2019s Cabinet will go a long way towards building trust and momentum with the American people.

That what we believe in still holds true today.\"\n\nThe governor\u2019s race was among the most closely followed contests of the midterms, with both Trump and national Democrats heavily invested in the outcome.\n\nSupporters of U.S. Senate candidate Rick Scott react to news of Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis winning his election at Scott's midterm election night party in Naples, Florida, on Nov. 6, 2018. Joe Skipper / Reuters\n\nEach candidate seemed to capture the zeitgeist of their party in 2018, presenting a stark choice for Florida voters that could offer a preview of the next presidential matchup.\n\nGillum, who backed single-payer health care and impeaching Trump, won his primary in an upset over a more conventional Democrat, Gwen Graham. Major Democratic donors like Tom Steyer backed his campaign early on, hoping to prove that a candidate with populist progressive views could win by boosting turnout among young and nonwhite voters to new heights rather than by reassuring moderate swing voters.\n\nRepublicans had held the governor\u2019s seat since the 1998 midterms, repelling a string of relatively centrist Democrats along the way.\n\nDeSantis, who resigned his House seat to run for governor, sought to mimic Trump's appeal in every way. He was a regular fixture on Fox News, the president's favorite source for information and comfort, and earned Trump's endorsement in the primaries and his support at campaign rallies in the general election. In one of the most memorable ads of the cycle, DeSantis was shown teaching his young children how to say Trump slogans like \"Build The Wall\" and \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nHis strategy appeared to work, helping counter Gillum's turnout surge with one of his own among voters still loyal to the president's message.\n\nExit polls showed 92 percent of Trump supporters and 85 percent of conservatives backed DeSantis on Tuesday.\n\nThe general election was notable for its direct clashes over race. Setting the tone early on, DeSantis said in a Fox News that Gillum would \"monkey this up\" if elected, which critics immediately denounced as a racist dog whistle.\n\nDeSantis denied the charge, but was dogged by follow-up reports on his association with far right figures and his refusal to return money from a donor who used the n-word to deride former President Barack Obama. A white supremacist group contacted Florida voters with robo-calls in which an actor performed a racist impression of Gillum, which the DeSantis campaign condemned. In a debate moment that went viral, Gillum said: \"I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I'm simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\"\n\nGillum faced his own vulnerabilities. The FBI is investigating corruption in Tallahassee and while there's no sign that Gillum is a target of the probe himself, he accepted free tickets to the musical Hamilton from an undercover agent and his public explanation was undercut by text messages that emerged during the race.

The number will rise: a handful of races remain undecided, including one between two women in California.\n\nIt is the latest in a year of record-breaking for women, who filed to run for Congress in historic numbers and won their primaries in historic numbers, too. So far, 123 women won their races out of 276 House, Senate, and gubernatorial candidates on the ballot: 13 women won Senate bids and nine women won gubernatorial races.\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate Ilhan Omar is greeted by her mother-in-law after appearing at her election night party in Minneapolis on Nov. 6, 2018.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman elected to the House, while Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are the first Muslim women elected to the House. Sharice Davids, a lesbian, lawyer and former mixed martial arts fighter, defeated a Republican incumbent in Kansas and will join Debra Haaland of New Mexico, another winning Democrat on Tuesday, as the first Native American women elected to Congress. Ayana Pressley became the first black woman to be elected to Congress by Massachusetts, and Jahana Hayes became the first black woman to be elected to Congress by Connecticut. New Mexico elected a woman to succeed another female governor, marking the first time the state has chosen back-to-back female governors.\n\nWomen were responsible for a slew of Democratic gains key to retaking control of the House, as well: Elaine Luria, a Democrat, won in Virginia's 2nd District, and Jennifer Wexton, a Democrat, won in Virginia's 10th. Democrat Abby Finekenaur won in Iowa's 1st Congressional District and Abigail Spanberger did so in Virginia's 7th District. All defeated Republican incumbents.\n\nThere were a handful of surprises \u2014 Democrat Kendra Horn won a safe Republican seat in Oklahoma's 5th Congressional District \u2014 and some notable losses by women. Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot, lost her bid for the House in Kentucky and North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp lost her re-election race.\n\nNine women won governorships, tying a previous record. All four incumbent women governors \u2014 Alabama's Republican Kay Ivey, Iowa's Republican Kim Reynolds, Rhode Island's Democrat Gina Raimondo, and Oregon's Democrat Kate Brown \u2014 held their seats, but governor's mansions around the country will also see fresh faces.\n\nDemocrat Laura Kelly defeated Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach in Kansas, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer won in Michigan, and Democrat Janet Mills won in Maine. The record could still be broken if Georgia's Stacey Abrams \u2014 whose race is too close to call with Republican Brian Kemp in the lead, according to NBC News \u2014 wins the seat.\n\nThe surge of women was fueled almost entirely by Democrats, who put an unheard of number of women on the ballot. Half of all non-incumbent Democratic nominees to the House were women, compared to just 18 percent of non-incumbent Republican House nominees. Of the 276 women on the ballot Tuesday in House, Senate and governor's races, 77 percent were Democrats.\n\nThese women didn\u2019t just break records, they set the political playbook on fire by throwing out the conventional wisdom that women must be twice as qualified, twice as polished and twice as careful as their male counterparts to mount a successful bid. In past years, women ran first for state and local offices, but this year\u2019s contest attracted fighter pilots, teachers, executives, nurses and moms so fed up with politics they decided to run themselves.\n\nSupporters of Democratic House candidate from Kansas Sharice Davids cheer and cry after learning she won at her election night watch party in Olathe, Kansas, on Nov. 6, 2018.

Jerome Coyle.\n\nIn a lengthy statement Tuesday, the diocese said more disclosures of misconduct may be forthcoming. It urged all victims to come forward and vowed to use their reports and other files to create and publish a list of credibly accused priests \u2014 a step the diocese had long resisted.\n\nCoyle admitted to then-Bishop Lawrence Soens in 1986 to having sexually abused 50 boys over a 20-year period. The diocese said that it should have notified parishes and asked victims to come forward back then, and apologized that its former leaders failed to do so. Instead, the diocese sent Coyle to a treatment center for accused priests in New Mexico, where he lived and worked as a civilian for decades.\n\nReuben Ortiz holding a photo of the Rev. Jerome Coyle in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Oct. 30, 2018. Ortiz says he was angered to learn that Coyle, who had been living at his home until recently, admitted in 1986 that he sexually abused 50 Iowa boys and that the church has kept it quiet for decades. Tania Ortiz / Reuben Ortiz via AP\n\nThe diocese said that its current leadership should have notified the public this summer when Coyle was placed at a retirement home near a Catholic school, which he moved out of last week following AP's disclosure of his history. But the statement said that its bishop, R. Walker Nickless, \"inherited many issues from the past,\" including the challenging of finding housing for accused priests who were never charged and aren't listed as sex offenders.\n\n\"What do we do with these men? We know that you do not want them in your community. Many care facilities will not, or cannot, take them. Their families sometimes will take them in, but not always,\" said the statement, issued through diocese spokeswoman Susan O'Brien.\n\nThe diocese indicated that other accused priests were sent for treatment, rather than investigated by police, and \"we know now that is not the way to handle any allegation of sexual misconduct.\"\n\nThe statement noted that the former bishop, Soens, is now 92 and lives in a Catholic retirement home in Sioux City. After retiring in 1998, he was accused of abusing boys when he was a priest and principal in the 1960s in Iowa City, and the Diocese of Davenport paid settlements to his accusers. The statement said that Soens has not faced any misconduct allegations stemming from his tenure in Sioux City.\n\nAs for Coyle, the diocese continues to pay his pension because he is entitled to those benefits by law, the statement said.", "Thank you so much for tuning in to our election night live blog.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Allan Smith\n\nRepublicans retained control of the Senate on Election Day, trouncing at least three Democratic incumbents and building upon their 51-49 majority in Congress' upper chamber.\n\nUnlike the House, where Democrats flipped nearly 30 seats from the GOP to regain control, Republicans fended off Democratic efforts to cut into the slim conservative advantage in the Senate.\n\nDemocratic fortunes quickly went south as NBC News projected that Republican challengers Mike Braun, Kevin Cramer and Josh Hawley defeated incumbent Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp and Claire McCaskill in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri, respectively. While Cramer built a substantial polling lead on Heitkamp in recent weeks, Donnelly and McCaskill were thought to be in much tighter races than the vote total would end up revealing.\n\nDemocrats were also unable to make gains in Texas and Tennessee \u2014 two states where Democratic challengers Beto O'Rourke and Phil Bredesen looked as if they could mount upset victories over Republicans. O'Rourke narrowly lost to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz while Bredesen did not come close to defeating Republican Rep. Martha Blackburn.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats were dealing with a possibility of having a fourth incumbent knocked off in Florida, where Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson trailed Republican Gov. Rick Scott by less than 1 percent with 99 percent of precincts reporting. The race was too close for NBC News to call.\n\nNelson's campaign said Wednesday there would be a recount, but the results are still unofficial and there was no official order for a recount. Overseas military ballots and provisional ballots must still be counted, which Florida election officials have 10 days to do.\n\nFlorida law requires a machine recount if the difference between the candidates is less than 0.5 percent. Currently, the gap is .42 percent.\n\nStill, the night was not a total loss for Democrats, even as Republicans knocked off a series of Democratic incumbents without taking much damage.\n\nAs was the story for much of the 2018 cycle, the Senate map presented Democrats with narrow opportunities to regain the majority. Ten Democrats \u2014 including Donnelly, Heitkamp, McCaskill and Nelson \u2014 were up for re-election in states Trump won, whereas just one Republican was up for re-election in a state that 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won.\n\nThat Republican incumbent, Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, was knocked off early Wednesday by Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen. NBC News projected a Rosen win shortly after Heller called her to concede the race.\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., sings along with John Rich, after addressing supporters in Franklin, Tennessee, on Tuesday. Mark Humphrey / AP\n\nOne race remained contested into Wednesday. In Arizona, Democratic challenger Kyrsten Sinema narrowly trailed Republican Rep. Martha McSally in a battle for Republican Sen. Jeff Flake's seat. The race was deemed too close by NBC News as of Wednesday afternoon as hundreds of thousands of votes remained as of yet uncounted.\n\nA Sinema victory would provide Democrats with a morale boost on the Senate side and improve the outlook from the election.\n\nMeanwhile, in Montana, NBC News called Democratic Sen. Jon Tester the apparent winner Wednesday afternoon, defeating Republican challenger Matt Rosendale.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday evening, NBC News projected that Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia were re-elected. Based on polling of the races, none of those senators' re-election efforts were ever in much doubt. But Trump did win each of those states in 2016, and Democratic losses there would've given Republicans a shot at a 60-vote supermajority.\n\nRepublicans could now begin the new year with anywhere from 52 to 54 Senate seats, gaining between one and three seats, depending on how Arizona and Florida turn out. There is also a runoff election in Mississippi set to take place later this month, with that battle looking likely to end with a GOP victory.\n\nWhile House Democrats, set to regain control of Congress' lower body, prepare for an onslaught of investigatory measures aimed at Trump and his administration, Republican reinforcements in the Senate will provide them with assistance on a few fronts.\n\nMost prominently, more Republican senators will help the party and the president continue to push through conservative judges onto the federal bench. Should another Supreme Court vacancy arise before the 2020 elections, Republicans will have more votes to help them get a nominee through a grueling confirmation battle.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said as much in a tweet after the GOP was projected to retain control of the Senate.\n\nAnd with speculation strong that Attorney General Jeff Sessions will be replaced following the election, more Republicans in the Senate means that a potential replacement may have a slightly easier time being confirmed.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Several West Coast results were still outstanding Wednesday morning.\n\nThe first big pick-up for Democrats came early, when NBC News projected that incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., would lose her House seat in that state's 10th Congressional District to Democrat Jennifer Wexton. The race, in a suburban northern Virginia district Hillary Clinton won by 10 percentage points in 2016, had been regarded by many observers as critical to Republican hopes of maintaining control of the lower chamber.\n\nAlso in Virginia, GOP Rep. Dave Brat, who defeated former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a major upset in a 2014 primary, lost Tuesday to Democrat Abigail Spanberger.\n\n\u201cMr. President, ready or not, here we come,\u201d said Democrat Donna Shalala, former Health and Human Services secretary under President Bill Clinton, who was projected to win Florida's 27th Congressional District.

She is likely to face resistance as she vies for the speakership in the House.\n\nThe House could also be divided on how hard to pursue investigations into President Trump\u2019s business endeavors, the plight for his tax returns and answers on whether or not anyone in the administration colluded with Russia in an effort to influence the 2016 election. Resistance will also come from the Senate, as Republicans remained in control, NBC News projects.\n\nBut Democrats on the House side were projected to defeat other high-profile Texas incumbents.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!,\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe concluded that Tuesday\u2019s results were a \u201cBig Victory,\u201d adding, \u201cTo any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!\u201d\n\nThe president said he would hold a press conference at 11:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nEleven-term GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, who has served as chairman of the powerful Rules Committee since 2013, was projected to lose his Dallas-area seat to Democrat Colin Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney. And Rep. John Culberson, who has served in the House since 2001, was on track to be defeated by Democrat Lizzie Fletcher in a district that Clinton carried by 1 percentage point two years ago.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Conor Lamb, who surprised Washington when he won a special election in the state, beat Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in a new district. Other red districts in Pennsylvania turned blue.\n\nRepublican-held seats in New Jersey also flipped. Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a former navy pilot, was projected to win her suburban Newark seat.\n\nStill, Republicans appeared to hold on in some closely-fought contests, such as Virginia's 5th Congressional District: the seat, which had been held by GOP Rep. Tom Garrett, was projected to go to Republican Denver Riggleman over Democrat Leslie Cockburn.\n\nIn Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, Rep. Andy Barr was projected to hold off a stiff challenge by Democrat Amy McGrath. Republican Bryan Steil will hold onto the seat in Wisconsin held by Speaker Paul Ryan, who is set to retire at the end of the year.\n\nAnd Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who was accused of racism and anti-Semitism, won his northwestern district anyway.\n\nTwo Republican incumbents who were indicted this year \u2014 Duncan Hunter in California and Chris Collins in New York \u2014 also won their races.\n\nIn New York though, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a democratic socialist, handily won the 14th Congressional District, becoming the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at 29.\n\nThe younger, more diverse crop of Democratic candidates seemed to invigorate voters and led to other history-making results. As of Wednesday morning, 99 women had won seats, breaking the current session's record of 84 women. Two of them are the first Native American women elected to the House, and two more are the first Muslim-American women elected.\n\n\"It's just a very robust class of candidates that really reflects who we are as a country,\u201d said Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, co-chair of House Democrats' recruitment efforts.\n\nDemocrats began the evening hoping for a wave election similar to the 2006 midterms when they captured 31 GOP-held seats amid voter discontent with President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, while Republicans had been hopeful the booming economy this year could give their prospects a boost.\n\nExcept for two recent midterm elections \u2014 in 1998, amid President Bill Clinton's impeachment saga, and in 2002, the year after the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 midterm elections have generally been unfavorable to the party in control of the White House. Since President Harry Truman's tenure, the incumbent president's party has averaged a loss of more than 28 House seats in his first midterm election.\n\n\u201cA party in power always faces tough odds in its first midterm election,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an election to know that we are a divided nation, and now we have a divided Washington.\u201d", "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The mood so far: #noregrets.\n\nThe president, according to multiple sources inside and close to the White House, is feeling validated about his closing strategy which focused on immigration. He\u2019s unapologetic and thinks that decision helped inject a shot of enthusiasm into the race, despite concerns from some Republicans that his divisive rhetoric may actually backfire.\n\nTrump is telling aides and allies he didn\u2019t leave anything on the table, and insisted his strategy changed the topic from \u201cthe left\u2019s closing argument, which was all health care,\u201d according to one outside adviser.\n\nHis staff is briefing him regularly on voter turnouts, which has been absolutely gangbusters. But history is not on his side. With just two exceptions, midterms have not gone well for the party controlling the White House. Trump hopes to be the exception \u2014 but already, the forecast from the White House signals more \u201cmixed bag\u201d than \u201cgiant victory lap.\u201d\n\nOn the Senate, the president is extremely interested in Florida, keying in on Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s Senate race and Ron DeSantis\u2019 gubernatorial race, according to multiple people familiar close to the president. He\u2019s also zeroing in on the races in Montana, Indiana and the Kansas governor\u2019s race where his friend Kris Kobach is running.\n\nA source close to the president frames his outlook as having three tiers:\n\nGOP seats to hold: Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee \u2014 with the assumption that GOP Sen. Ted Cruz is re-elected in Texas.\n\nPick-up opportunities, in order of likelihood: North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Florida. If Republicans win all four of those \u2014 which is a big if \u2014 it could put other seats in play.

All of it is grim.\n\nNo one who was willing to speak, even on background, was optimistic about Republicans keeping the House majority. The question now appears to be not whether Republicans will lose, but by how much. Despite the president railing against Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on the campaign trail, two sources says the president is still open to working with her if she ends up House Speaker.\n\nStill, the president is insistent that \u201cTrump Republicans,\u201d are being under-polled, according to one source. Recall that much of the polling in 2016 grossly under-surveyed both the white non-college educated population and rural voters \u2014 a demographic that makes up President Trump\u2019s base.\n\nLater tonight, the president will have dinner ahead of a reception at the White House of more than 100 people, including representation from the GOP donor community, to watch election returns.", "Voters in today's midterm election are more likely to oppose the U.S. Senate\u2019s decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court than they are to support it, according to early NBC News Exit Poll results.

If she wins, Abrams would become the first African-American woman to be elected governor in the country.\n\nThe already heated race entered a new phase Sunday when Kemp's office accused the Georgia Democratic Party of attempting to hack the state's voter registration system.\n\nThe state Democratic Party sharply denied the allegations, calling them \"a reckless and unethical ploy.\"\n\nKemp, the state's top official overseeing the election, has been under increasing scrutiny after the Associated Press reported in October that his office had put on hold 53,000 voter registration applications \u2014 70 percent of them from black applicants \u2014 for failing to clear an \"exact match\" process.\n\nThe protocol requires information on voter registration applications to precisely match information on file with the state's Department of Motor Vehicles or the Social Security Administration.\n\nSeveral civil rights groups sued Kemp seeking relief for roughly 3,100 prospective voters who were flagged by the state as non-citizens.\n\nA federal judge ruled last Friday that Kemp must allow new U.S. citizens to vote if they can show proof of citizenship at the polls.\n\nAbrams, as well as civil rights groups have accused Kemp of voter suppression because of the racial disparity in the pending applications.
