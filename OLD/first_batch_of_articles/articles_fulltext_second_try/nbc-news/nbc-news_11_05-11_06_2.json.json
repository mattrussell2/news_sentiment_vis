The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Doha Madani and Sarah Ford\n\nA Colorado man who publicly begged for the safe return of his missing pregnant wife and their two daughters on Tuesday pleaded guilty to killing them, in a deal the prosecutor said spares him the death penalty.\n\nChristopher Watts, 33, pleaded guilty to all nine counts against him \u2014 including five counts of first-degree murder \u2014 in the deaths of his wife, Shanann Watts, and their daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, whose bodies were found on the property of an oil and gas company where Christopher Watts worked in August, according to a press release from Colorado's 19th Judicial District.\n\nThe plea deal includes a sentencing agreement that Christopher Watts will be sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison, Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke said.\n\nRourke said at a press conference that the plea deal was made with the support of Shanann Watts\u2019 family, and after he explained what he called the \"extraordinary delays that currently exist\" in Colorado in putting prisoners to death.\n\n\"They were very strongly in favor of a resolution in this case short of the death penalty,\" Rourke said. Rourke recounted a conversation with Shanann Watts' mother, Sandra Rzucek, that helped make the decision.\n\n\"Sandy said it very, very poignantly to me. She said, 'he made the choice to take those lives. I do not want to be in a position of making the choice to take his,'\" Rourke said. \"And so that's about as firmly as she could have said it to me, and that was very compelling to all of us as we were talking about how to proceed on this case.\"\n\nChristopher Watts pleaded guilty to five counts of murder in the first degree, three counts of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy.\n\nHe appeared calm but emotional, speaking in a shaky voice as he entered his plea in court. He did not look at member of Shanann Watts\u2019 family.\n\nShanann Watts, 34, and their daughters, Bella and Celeste, were originally reported missing in August. Chris pleaded for their return in interviews held outside the family's home in Frederick, Colorado, telling reporters \"I just want them home so bad.\"\n\nThe Colorado Bureau of Investigations later said Shanann Watts and the girls were murdered inside their home. Shanann Watts' body was later discovered on the property of an oil and natural gas company that Christopher Watts had worked for. The bodies of Bella and Celeste were later found nearby in an oil tank.\n\nShanann Watts was 15 weeks pregnant at the time of her death.\n\nChristopher Watts initially claimed to police after he was arrested that he killed Shanann Watts after she killed their daughters, according to court documents.\n\nRourke called those claims a \"flat out lie\" and said he did not believe Christopher Watts would give authorities a full, accurate and truthful statement.\n\n\"What I can tell you most affirmatively today, by what happened in the courtroom, is the spotlight that he tried to shine on Shanann falsely, incorrectly and frankly a flat out lie has been corrected,\" Rourke said. \"The spotlight shines directly where it belongs \u2014 on him.\"\n\nAsked if a motive has been determined in the case, Rourke said that investigators believe they have a \"partial motive\" and Rourke said he would have more to say about that following the sentencing, which is scheduled for Nov. 19.", "Inside the NBC News Decision Desk copied!\n\nNBC News\u2019 Cynthia McFadden takes us past the velvet rope to the beating heart of NBC\u2019s election coverage.\n\nRead More", "officials detail plea deal in Shanann Watts murder case copied!\n\nofficials provide details to the public on the plea deal in the Shanann Watts murder case.\n\nRead More", "Hotly contested Governors races could give foresight into the 2020 elections copied!\n\nIn Florida, all eye are on Democrat Andrew Gillum, up against Trump-backed Republican Ron DeSantis.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Benjy Sarlin\n\nVoters were highly concerned about health care, according to preliminary exit polls on Tuesday, with more citing it as their top concern than the economy or any other issue \u2014 the first time in at least a decade that has happened.\n\nA plurality of 41 percent identified health care as the issue most important to their vote, which Democrats made the centerpiece of their campaign in races throughout the country.\n\nAsked which party would better address Americans with pre-existing conditions, 58 percent said Democrats versus 34 percent who said Republicans.\n\nThe White House, Republican state officials, Republicans in Congress had repeatedly sought to eliminate or roll back protections for pre-existing conditions via lawsuits and legislation, but many candidates tried to take a softer tone on the issue in the final days of the midterms.\n\nEconomy takes back seat\n\nThe set of issues voters prioritized this year looked very different than exit polls of past elections, where the economy was typically a larger focus.\n\nAnother 23 percent named immigration, which the president aggressively pushed into the national conversation over the last week, at one point producing an ad that networks refused to run for its inflammatory depiction of Hispanic immigrants as violent criminals.\n\nThe president\u2019s handling of the issue divided voters relatively closely, with 48 percent calling them too tough, 16 percent saying they weren\u2019t tough enough, and 32 percent saying they were just right.\n\nIn an unusual break from recent history, only 21 percent naming it as their leading concern. It was the first time in more than a decade that a plurality of voters had not named it their number one issue in exit polling and comes after weeks of positive headlines on job and wage growth.\n\nAnother 11 percent named gun policy, which became a focus of activism after mass shootings at a music festival in Las Vegas last year, a high school in Parkland, Florida in March, and a synagogue in Pittsburgh just last month.\n\nMajority disapproves of Trump\n\nVoters signaled their discontent with President Donald Trump's performance as well as the overall direction of the country.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s approval rating stood at 44 percent versus 54 percent disapproval among respondents, roughly in line with public polling in the lead-up to the midterm.\n\nThere was an intensity gap between his critics and supporters as well, with a full 47 percent reporting they strongly disapproved of his performance versus only 31 percent who said they strongly approved.\n\nVoters reported that Trump played a significant role in their midterm choices as well. About two-thirds said he was a factor in their vote, with 38 percent saying they cast a ballot to oppose his policies, 26 percent saying they did so to support him, and only 33 percent reporting that he played no role in their decision.\n\nCountry on wrong track\n\nVoters appeared to be in a bleak mood about the state of the nation. Fifty-six percent said the country was on the wrong track, versus 41 percent who said things were headed in the right direction. That number was down from the last presidential election, however, when 62 percent said things were on the wrong track, as well as the last midterm election, when 65 percent said the same.\n\nAcross party lines, voters perceived the country\u2019s political culture as harsh and getting harsher. 77 percent said the nation was becoming more divided, versus just 8 percent who thought it was becoming more united and 13 percent who thought it was staying the same.\n\nGender gap, but not a chasm\n\nIn a year that's featured a huge spike in women running for office among Democrats, the gender gap looks to be on par with prior elections. 39 percent of women said they support Republican candidates in exit polls while 50 percent of men reported supporting Republicans. That's a drop in support for Republicans among both groups since 2016, but a similar 11-point distance between them.\n\nThere was a significant gender gap in opinions of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was confirmed after Christine Blasey Ford testified he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, a charge he denied. Voters opposed his confirmation by a 48 to 43 margin in the exit poll overall, but 50 percent of men supported confirmation versus 37 percent of women.", "Senate races to watch as Republicans hope to keep majority copied!\n\nWith ten Senate Democrats up for re-election in red states that President Trump won, Republicans are hoping to maintain control of the Senate.\n\nRead More", "Midterms 2018: Voters battle long lines and malfunctioning machines copied!\n\nIn Indiana, long lines were caused by slow electronic poll books used to check in voters, a machine glitch held up voting in Atlanta, and flashlights came to the rescue after a lack of power hit a polling place in Tennessee.\n\nRead More", "Energized voters hit the polls for what could be record midterm turnout copied!\n\nEnthusiasm ran high among Republican and Democratic voters, as President Trump hinted the election was a referendum on him.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

High concentrations of ammonia can cause irritation of the eyes, nose and throat in both humans and animals,\" the agency said.\n\nThe product will likely be marketed as a benefit to the environment.\n\n\"Additionally, ammonia gases can contribute to a process called eutrophication, in which bodies of water become enriched with excess nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorous,\" the FDA added.\n\n\"This nutrient enrichment in the water causes algae blooms, which block sunlight to aquatic plants, and eventually results in the death of aquatic animals due to a lack of oxygen in the water. Therefore, reduction of ammonia gas reasonably may be expected to provide some benefit to the environment.\"\n\nElanco, the company that makes Experior, indicated the goal is to help farmers sell a product they can label environmentally friendly. So far, it's approved for use in beef cattle, including steers and heifers, in their last days before slaughter.\n\n\"Today\u2019s consumers are increasingly interested in the environmental sustainability of their food,\" a spokesperson for Elanco told NBC News.\n\nTests showed the product was safe for the cattle and for people who eat any beef produced by treated cattle, the FDA said.

The video caught the attention of TV host Ellen Degeneres, who would later have O\u2019Rourke on her show.\n\nThe video, which has since racked up 67.4 million views on social platforms around the globe, according to online video measurement firm Tubular, was the work of NowThis, a social media-focused, youth-oriented news organization started in 2012. Six years since its start, the company is still focused on making video for social platforms \u2014 a proposition that has proven to be challenging territory for media organizations.\n\n\u201cWe live in a scrolling economy,\u201d said Athan Stephanopoulos, president of NowThis. \u201cHow can we get people to stop and engage in an asset and keep them as long as possible?\u201d\n\nNowThis has weathered many of the challenges faced by digital media startups even as companies like Facebook, which account for a large part of the company\u2019s audience, change their priorities. The company has around 125 employees and remains focused on producing social media-friendly video, where it often bests traditional media companies.\n\n\"They understand the social video audience and understand what to create and it all came together in a perfect storm with Beto,\u201d Allison Stern, the co-founder of online video measurement firm Tubular, said of NowThis. \u201cBut this is not an anomaly they're generating video hits all the time.\"\n\nIn September, the company\u2019s politics vertical and its flagship NowThis vertical recorded 274 million views and 268 million views respectively on Facebook, taking the No. 2 and 3 spots in social video in the global news and politics category. Daily Mail was number one with 974 million views, ABC News and CBS News came fourth and fifth, according to Tubular Labs data. The company shares up to 100 videos a day across Facebook, Facebook Watch, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat and collects around 2.5 billion views monthly, according to NowThis.\n\nNowThis has been particularly active in following Democratic politicians in the runup to the 2018 midterm elections, following O\u2019Rourke as well as Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29 year-old who is running for Congress in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District.\n\nThe company has focused particularly hard on first-time candidates with a series called \u201cFirsts\u201d about 30 candidates who could make history if they win their races.\n\n\u201cThere are so many first-time candidates and a record breaking number of women,\u201d Stephanopoulos said.\n\nNowThis is part of Group Nine Media, a company that owns a variety of digital media companies including animal-focused TheDodo, Thrillist and Discovery Digital Networks\u2019 Seeker, a science-themed destination. The company is run by Chief Executive Officer Ben Lerer, the son of Ken Lerer, the former AOL communications chief who went on to become a successful venture capitalist, investing in The Huffington Post and BuzzFeed.\n\nSome digital media companies have struggled in recent years as platforms have shifted priorities making it harder to monetize video. Facebook's changes to its News Feed punished some NowThis competitors such as Little Things, which shuttered earlier this year.\n\nStephanopoulos said Facebook\u2019s changes were more of a risk for outlets that were not as immersed in Facebook as NowThis.\n\n\u201cI think those algorithm changes have a much bigger impact for publishers who play in Facebook a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\nJessica Richards, managing director of North America at marketing agency Socialyse, said NowThis is on her radar as she tracks how young news consumers are using social media.\n\n\u201cTheir stats indicate about 60 percent of the audience is made up of the standard millennial segment of 18-34 year olds,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt speaks to change in consumption patterns for content with current and future generations.\u201d\n\nWhile NowThis may not be a household name, Stephanopoulos said he realized the company was making an impact when a mom stopped the NowThis team after they conducted an interview with former Vice President Joe Biden to ask who they were with.\n\nThe daughters were embarrassed and hung back until Stephanopoulos revealed they were with NowThis.\n\n\u201cThe three daughters came running over, and said, \u2018mom this is where we get our news,\u2019\u201d Stephanopoulos said. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018that\u2019s it.\u2019 It was a solidifying moment.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

A court date was set for Dec. 11.\n\nTreu was charged Tuesday with four counts of homicide while intoxicated; four counts of hit and run involving death and one count of hit and run involving great bodily injury; one count of bail jumping and one count of intentionally abusing a hazardous substance, according to online court records.\n\nTreu and his passenger told investigators they had been huffing from a computer keyboard cleaner they'd purchased that day, the Associated Press reported. The passenger, who has not been arrested or charged, told police he grabbed the steering wheel when he saw that Treu \"looked out of it\" and that the truck was crossing over the road's center line.\n\nTreu told investigators he never passed out and that his passenger \"was huffing a lot more than him,\" according to the complaint. He said he \"lost control of the vehicle and fishtailed\" after his passenger grabbed the steering wheel.\n\nProsecutors said Treu was involved in a similar incident in September when his vehicle rolled over while he was under the influence of drugs.\n\nThe three Girl Scouts killed in Saturday\u2019s crash have been identified by police as Jayna Kelley, 9; Autumn Helgeson, 10; and Haylee Hickle, 10.

The split was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cAmazon extracting highly favorable terms, only to halve its promise and expect those same terms, is an exercise of bargaining power that will be familiar to many of the millions of merchants reliant on Amazon\u2019s platform,\u201d tweeted Lina Khan, a senior fellow with the Open Markets Institute.\n\nAmazon set off a bidding war last year when it announced a quest to find an \u201cequal\u201d to its Seattle campus, with 238 cities vying for Amazon\u2019s \u201cHQ2\u201d by offering tax incentives and staging publicity stunts. One Arizona economic group attempted to send a giant cactus to Seattle, while the mayor of Kansas City reviewed 1,000 items on Amazon\u2019s website.\n\nThe announcement generated countless headlines from technology reporters, examining everything from the case against having Amazon HQ2 coming to town to the most likely contenders on a shortlist of 20 cities that was released in January and the \u201cPR genius\u201d of the guessing game.\n\nThe publicized competition had already caused some to question Amazon\u2019s motives around HQ2, but Monday\u2019s news became a distinct turning point in the broader narrative around \u201cHQ2.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a farce,\u201d wrote David Streitfeld in The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThe real HQ2 was the dignity we lost along the way,\u201d wrote Henry Grabar at Slate.\n\n\u201cThis entire charade was an exercise in corporate leverage,\u201d tweeted Mike Isaac, a technology journalist at The New York Times.\n\nAmazon has not yet publicly announced a decision, but a report from the Times said Amazon had been zeroing in on the New York City area and Northern Virginia.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Liz Szabo, Kaiser Health News\n\nIn the run-up to the midterm elections, the soda industry has poured millions of dollars into fighting taxes on sugary drinks, an increasingly popular approach to combating obesity, which affects 40 percent of American adults.\n\nSoda makers have campaigned against sugary drink taxes in dozens of cities in recent years, mostly successfully. But after a string of recent defeats, the industry is now pushing statewide measures that strip cities and towns of their ability to tax soda. Two of these state initiatives are on the ballot Tuesday in Washington and Oregon.\n\nArizona and Michigan already ban localities from enacting soda taxes. In California, where four cities have soda taxes, the beverage industry pressured lawmakers this summer into accepting a 12-year moratorium on local taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks. Some California lawmakers said they felt held \"hostage\u201d by the soda industry, which spent $7 million on a ballot initiative that would have made it much harder for cities to raise taxes of any kind. The beverage industry dropped the initiative after lawmakers agreed to the moratorium.\n\nSoda makers also have cultivated close relationships with doctors, scientists and professional societies, including the Obesity Society and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Both groups say there is scant evidence that sugar taxes are effective.\n\nPublic health advocates say Big Soda is following a script perfected by the tobacco companies, which denied that their products were harmful and funded research that cast doubt on scientific studies while forcefully resisting taxes and regulations. Tobacco companies used their lobbying clout to persuade state lawmakers to prevent cities and counties from passing smoke-free ordinances. In 2006, 21 states pre-empted local smoke-free laws, according to Americans for Nonsmokers\u2019 Rights. Even today, 13 states have some sort of ban on local smoke-free laws.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely parallels with the tobacco industry,\u201d said Betsy Janes, an activist with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network lobby. Soda makers \u201care happy to take a page from their playbook.\u201d\n\nFollowing recommendations from the World Health Organization, more than 30 countries and seven U.S. cities \u2014 including Seattle, San Francisco and Boulder, Colo. \u2014 now tax sugary drinks. These laws usually exempt diet soda, pure fruit juice and bottled water.\n\nMost public health advocates describe soda taxes as a proven way to reduce Americans\u2019 consumption of added sugars, which have been linked to 40,000 deaths from heart disease every year. A study published last year in PLOS One projects that Mexico\u2019s soda tax will prevent up to 134,000 cases of diabetes by 2030. In Philadelphia, sales of sweetened beverages fell 57 percent in six months after a city tax of 1.5 cents per ounce took effect, according to a 2017 study.\n\nSoda companies used their war chests to fund the Washington and Oregon ballot measures. Coca-Cola has contributed nearly half the $20 million raised in support of the Washington initiative, while the American Beverage Association has contributed about half of the $5.6 million behind the Oregon measure.\n\nPepsiCo, one of the largest soda companies, did not respond to calls or emails. Coca-Cola declined to comment on the issue, referring all questions to the American Beverage Association, which represents the soda industry. William Dermody, a spokesman for the beverage association, declined to comment on the comparison with Big Tobacco. But Dermody said the soda industry supports \u201ckeeping food and beverages affordable\u201d and is \u201cstanding up for small business and working families\u201d by supporting the ballot measures. Taxes on soda and other groceries \u201care harmful; they raise prices and they cost jobs,\u201d he said\n\nBoth the Oregon and Washington measures ask voters to either allow towns and cities to tax groceries or prohibit them from doing so. But health advocates say the ballot measures aren\u2019t really about groceries. The beverage industry\u2019s strong support suggests that the measures are really about protecting soda profits, said Hillary Caron, senior policy associate at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nIn Washington, basic groceries are exempt from sales taxes, said state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, a Seattle Democrat opposed to the initiative. \u201cIn 41 years, there hasn\u2019t been one bill to tax groceries,\u201d Carlyle said. The beverage industry \u201cis retaliating against our state\u201d because of Seattle\u2019s soda tax.\n\nMatthew Myers, of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the tobacco industry has long allied itself with anti-tax and pro-business groups, which have helped it fend off cigarette taxes. The tobacco industry fought smoke-free laws by warning that they would drive customers away from restaurants and bars. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that smoking bans increase business at bars and restaurants because customers enjoy clean air. Similarly, research shows that Philadelphia\u2019s sugary drink tax hasn\u2019t hurt business, Myers said. Although sales of sugary drinks have fallen, overall business at chain stores hasn\u2019t suffered, according to a 2017 study. A study of a soda tax in Berkeley, California, found similar results, with residents buying less soda but more bottled water.\n\nPublic health groups said they aren\u2019t giving up on soda taxes. In California, the state dental and medical associations have filed a ballot measure for 2020 to create a statewide tax on sugary drinks.\n\nA Show of Force\n\nSoda makers have plenty of money for a fight. The food and beverage industry spends $22.4 million a year on lobbying, including $5.4 million by Coca-Cola. That\u2019s more than the tobacco industry, which spends $16.7 million on lobbying, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nThe tobacco industry spent decades funneling money into research that made cigarettes look less harmful than they really were, Myers said. Beverage companies have also tried to win over scientists and medical societies by funding research, said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University and author of \u201cUnsavory Truth: How Food Companies Skew the Science of What We Eat.\u201d\n\nSoda industry funding of medical meetings, journals and researchers is ubiquitous. Coca-Cola acknowledges spending $146 million on \u201cwell-being-related scientific research, partnership and health professional activities\u201d from 2010 through 2017. A 2016 study found that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo funded 95 national medical organizations from 2011 to 2015, while lobbying against 29 public health bills that aimed to reduce soda consumption or improve diet. Coca-Cola funded the publication of 389 articles in 169 journals from 2008 to 2016, according to a study published this year in Public Health Nutrition.\n\nNestle said no one should be surprised that industry-funded research tends to absolve soda from any role in causing obesity. Beverage industry research typically shifts the blame for obesity onto inactivity and \u201cenergy balance,\u201d suggesting that exercise is far more important to weight loss than cutting back on sugar and calories, she said.\n\nYet independent researchers have found \u201cquite compelling\u201d evidence linking sugary drinks to obesity, heart disease and diabetes, said Dr. Frank Hu, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The CDC notes that sodas are among the largest sources of added sugar in the American diet. A 12-ounce can of Coke contains 9 \u2153 teaspoons of sugar; the American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than six teaspoons of sugar a day, and that men limit themselves to nine.\n\nDermody questioned the link between sugary drinks and obesity. Obesity has increased steadily over the past three decades. Yet in 2015, sales of carbonated soft drinks fell to their lowest level in 30 years, suggesting that the obesity epidemic is being driven by something other than soda, Dermody said. He noted that half the soft drinks sold today have no calories. That shows that voluntary industry efforts to reduce sugar and calories in soft drinks are working, and that taxes aren\u2019t needed, he maintained.\n\nA number of medical groups and universities stopped accepting soda industry funding in 2015, after extensive publicity of Coca-Cola\u2019s attempts to influence science. Most health groups \u2014 including the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society and American Diabetes Association \u2014 now support soda taxes.\n\nTwo medical groups have defied this trend.\n\nIn July, just after California lawmakers approved the moratorium on soda taxes, the Obesity Society, which represents doctors who treat overweight patients, issued a statement saying there\u2019s no proof that such measures will save lives. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, which includes dietitians, has taken a \u201cneutral\u201d stand on soda taxes, noting that \u201cscientific evidence is insufficiently clear.\u201d In a statement similar to positions taken by the beverage industry, the nutrition academy said, \u201cNo single food or beverage leads to overweight or obesity when consumed in moderate amounts and within the context of the total diet.\u201d\n\nBoth the obesity and nutrition groups have had close relationships with the soda industry. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were \u201cpremier sponsors\u201d of the nutrition academy in 2016, according to the group\u2019s annual report. PepsiCo and Ocean Spray paid for \u201cpremium\u201d exhibit booths at the nutrition academy\u2019s national conference in October. Booths that size were priced at nearly $40,000 to $50,000 each.\n\nAt Ocean Spray's booth at the October meeting of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in Washington, dietitians could don waterproof overalls and pose for selfies in an artificial cranberry bog. Liz Szabo / Kaiser Health News\n\nIn October, PepsiCo underwrote a special issue of the Obesity Society\u2019s journal, which was devoted entirely to the science of artificial sweeteners, at a cost of $26,880. Although PepsiCo paid the journal\u2019s publisher for the special issue, part of the money also went to the Obesity Society, said Dr. Steven Heymsfield, the group\u2019s president-elect. The Obesity Society has also nurtured close ties with soda makers through a \u201cfood industry engagement council.\u201d Past meetings were chaired by executives of PepsiCo and attended by employees of the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, now known as Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nAnthony Comuzzie, the Obesity Society\u2019s executive director, said the society has disbanded the food industry council. In an email, Comuzzie denied that the society\u2019s ties to industry have influenced its position on soda taxes. \u201cTo imply that the group or society collectively is biased by food companies has no basis in reality,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nThe nutrition academy notes that sponsorships make up less than 5 percent of its budget. \u201cRevenue generated from sponsorships has no impact on the academy\u2019s policy making or any stance on issues,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nNestle said the soda industry appears to have bought the nutrition academy\u2019s silence.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that the academy is not strongly supporting public health measures to prevent obesity,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cThe academy\u2019s position puts it squarely on the side of the food industry and against public health.\u201d\n\nLiz Szabo: lszabo@kff.org, @LizSzabo\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.

But the two Democrats will be closely monitoring tonight\u2019s results, eager to see their party rebound \u2014 and in Biden\u2019s case, with a possible future White House run in mind.\n\nA senior Obama official said the mood within their ranks was good after a closing campaign blitz by the 44th president. \u201cBut everyone has PTSD from 2016,\u201d the official added, when most were confident Hillary Clinton would succeed Obama.\n\nBiden was more optimistic about the outlook Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI'll be dumbfounded if we lose the House, dumbfounded,\u201d he told NBC News after casting his own ballot near his home in Wilmington, Delaware. \u201cI think we'll pick up to six governor seats in critical states in the upper Midwest and out west,\" he said, adding, \"I still think there's a shot of us winning the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe Obama and Biden teams remained in close contact this fall as each sketched out a busy fall campaign itinerary.\n\nFor Obama's team, the goal was to get the \u201cmost bang for the buck\u201d in a trimmed down campaign schedule \u2014 stumping in areas where he could affect the most races at once, with a special focus on races that could help Democrats heading into the post-2020 redistricting as well as races where he could help promising Democrats get across the finish line and build a new bench of talent in the party.\n\nThe Obama aide pointed to gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Andrew Gillum in Florida and Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, as well as Texas Senate hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke, as among the rising stars who caught Obama\u2019s attention.\n\nObama made nearly a dozen public appearances after Labor Day, mostly at rallies targeting new and young voters. He also recorded 50 robocalls, radio ads and digital messages helping Democratic candidates. He took his cues, in part, from congressional leaders.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Obama personally and asked him to stump for Joe Donnelly in Indiana, for instance. Obama won the state in 2008.\n\nObama\u2019s NowThis video op-ed generated 17 million views, and the ATTN GOTV video reached 16 million people \u2014 driving nearly 700,000 viewers to vote.org to register, vote early, and find their polling place, Obama\u2019s team says.\n\n\u201cCampaign travel is the most visible sign of our political support but is not necessarily the impactful,\u201d senior Obama adviser Eric Schultz told NBC News. \u201cWe are acutely aware that Democrats have a mixed record of success when President Obama is not on the ballot, and that he can galvanize opponents. That\u2019s why we focused this year on tailored, GOTV strategies designed to move the needle for candidates.\u201d\n\nBiden has been among the most active national Democrats this cycle, visiting 24 states for public appearances and appearing at fundraisers for 65 candidates on the ballot Tuesday. He has held 18 public rallies just since Labor Day, including 13 in the last week.\n\nBiden said Tuesday morning he had already called 25 candidates he\u2019s endorsed this cycle. And he was planning to watch election returns at home in Delaware in close coordination with his political war room in Washington.\n\nBiden\u2019s political moves will attract greater scrutiny as he reiterated Tuesday that he is still considering a run for president in 2020. The final campaign event Biden held Sunday seemed specifically designed to send a message about what the former vice president thinks he can uniquely bring to the ticket.\n\nIt was in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, not far from Biden\u2019s home town of Scranton. The county was among those with the biggest swing from blue to red in 2016 \u2014 from a 5 point Obama-Biden victory in 2012 to a 20-point Trump-Pence win, as the GOP also carried the state as a whole.\n\nAnd in his campaign appearances Biden has been not shy about criticizing Democrats for, in his view, not doing enough to communicate to voters what they stand for, beyond opposition to Trump.\n\n\u201cAmericans already know who Donald Trump is. The question is, who are we?\u201d he told voters last week. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been clear the last year and a half.\u201d\n\nBiden has crystalized the case this way: Democrats need to restore dignity to the public discourse, and help restore what he calls the \u201cbasic bargain\u201d for the middle class, that they will share in the overall prosperity of the nation.\n\nBiden\u2019s team is already considering what campaigning he might do after Tuesday if any races go into overtime, like the Mississippi Senate race or Georgia governor\u2019s race. And as he prepares for what he calls a \u201cfamily decision\u201d about his political future in December, Biden will also travel to promote the new paperback release of his 2017 book, \u201cPromise Me, Dad,\u201d about the death of his eldest son, Beau.\n\nSo far, three stops are scheduled in Montana, Texas and Vermont.\n\nMike Memoli reported from Wilmington, Del.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nAs they weighed in on the Republican-vs.-Democrat power struggle, voters in many states also were considering an array of intriguing ballot measures \u2014 ranging from marijuana legalization to boosting the minimum wage to civil rights protections for transgender people.\n\nIn all, 155 statewide initiatives are on the ballot Tuesday in 37 states. Most were drafted by state legislatures, but 64 resulted from citizen-initiated campaigns, including many of the most eye-catching proposals.\n\nIn North Dakota and Michigan, for example, voters had a chance to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, a step already taken by nine other states. The ballots in Missouri and Utah included proposals to legalize the medical use of pot.\n\nA minimum wage increase was up for a vote in two states. An Arkansas measure would raise the wage from $8.50 an hour to $11 by 2021; Missouri's would gradually raise the $7.85 minimum wage to $12 an hour.\n\nMedicaid expansion was another multistate topic, on the ballot because Republican-led legislatures refused to take advantage of expanded coverage offered under President Barack Obama's health care law. Measures in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah would expand Medicaid coverage to tens of thousands more residents; a Montana measure would to raise tobacco taxes to extend an existing expansion.\n\nProposals to change the redistricting process so it's potentially less partisan were on the ballot in Missouri, Michigan, Utah and Colorado.\n\nThe goal is \"giving citizens, not politicians, a greater voice in the drawing of their voting district lines,\" said Sam Mar of the Action Now Initiative, which provided more than $7 million in support of the measures.\n\nAnother measure that could influence future election outcomes was on the ballot in Florida, the most populous swing state. It would restore the right to vote for most people with felony convictions upon completion of their sentences, potentially adding more than 1 million Floridians to the voting rolls.\n\nThe Democrats in Florida's two highest-profile election contests supported the amendment \u2014 Andrew Gillum, who is running for governor, and Bill Nelson, who is seeking a fourth term in the U.S. Senate. Nelson's GOP opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, opposed the amendment, as did Ron DeSantis, the Republican seeking to succeed Scott as governor.\n\nOhio's ballot included an ambitious proposal to make drug possession a misdemeanor in an effort to reduce the state prison population and divert any savings to drug treatment.\n\nWhile liberal-leaning groups succeeded in getting some of their favored policy proposals on the ballot in Republican-controlled states, the partisan pattern was reversed in Democratic-leaning Oregon and Massachusetts. In both states, conservatives used the initiative process in a bid to overturn existing policies.\n\nThe target in Massachusetts was a 2016 law extending nondiscrimination protections to transgender people in their use of public accommodations. It was the first-ever statewide vote on this question, occurring as President Donald Trump's administration moves to weaken civil rights protections for transgender Americans.\n\nConservatives in Oregon targeted two policies \u2014 one allowing use of state money to pay for low-income women to have abortions, the other forbidding law enforcement agencies from using state resources or personnel to arrest people whose only crime is being in the U.S. illegally. Oregon adopted its \"sanctuary state\" law in 1987, becoming the first state to do so.\n\nOregon and its northern neighbor, Washington, each had measures that would prohibit local governments from imposing new taxes on soda or grocery items.\n\nWashington voters also had a chance to toughen background checks for people buying semi-automatic rifles and to make their state the first to charge a direct fee on carbon pollution to fight climate change.\n\nClimate change also was an issue in Arizona and Nevada, where voters considered measures requiring that 50 percent of electricity come from renewable sources by 2030. A measure in Colorado could sharply reduce oil and gas drilling, including the method known as fracking, by requiring new oil and gas wells to be further from occupied buildings than allowed under current law.\n\nCuriously, slavery also was on the Colorado ballot. A proposed amendment would remove language in the state Constitution allowing slavery and involuntary servitude to be used to punish a crime.\n\nThe two most expensive ballot-measure campaigns \u2014 each generating more than $100 million in contributions \u2014 were in California.

These aren\u2019t always the races with the biggest drama or the most compelling candidates (although some are!), but they\u2019re the ones we\u2019ve identified as being the most informative about the political landscape.\n\nKeep in mind: Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to gain back control of the United States House, while they need a net gain of two to gain the majority in the Senate. Democrats are favored by most analysts, including NBC News, to reach their goal in the House; Republicans have the advantage to maintain their dominance in the Senate.\n\n6 p.m. ET poll close\n\nKentucky 06: The first competitive race to see polls close on Election Night is also one of the country\u2019s most closely watched. Democrats believe they have one of their best candidates of the cycle in this Lexington-area district in Amy McGrath, a retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel who was the first female Marine to fly in an F-18 on a combat mission. She\u2019s running against incumbent GOP Rep. Andy Barr in a district that picked Donald Trump by 16 points in 2016.\n\nThe vote will give an early indication of whether voters in GOP-leaning districts are looking for change or sticking with the GOP. But there\u2019s a caveat: McGrath\u2019s personal story has gotten so much press \u2014 and the attack ads against both candidates have been so overwhelming \u2014 that this race could end up illustrating national trends OR bucking them.\n\n7 p.m. ET poll close\n\nGeorgia Governor: In one of the most closely-watched gubernatorial races of the cycle, Democrat Stacey Abrams faces conservative Republican Brian Kemp in her attempt to become the first female African-American governor in U.S. history. It\u2019s a stark contrast. Abrams has celebrated her history-making candidacy, campaigned with Oprah Winfrey and emphasized education and criminal justice issues.\n\nKemp won his contested GOP primary largely by embracing President Donald Trump and highlighting his positions on gun rights and illegal immigration. Abrams\u2019 path to victory will require huge turnout of African-American voters who often aren\u2019t engaged in midterms \u2014 as well as big numbers with more affluent and well-educated white voters in the state who are fed up with Trump. A win for her could also mean House pickups for Democrats in two seats in the Atlanta suburbs.\n\nIndiana Senate: Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly and Republican Mike Braun aren\u2019t the most charismatic of the 2018 candidates, which makes this race a good barometer of how a relatively generic Democratic incumbent fares against a generic Republican in a red-leaning state. Donnelly is still fairly popular in the state, but he\u2019s still running neck-and-neck with Braun. If he looks poised for defeat early in the night, Democrats can probably wave goodbye to their slim hopes of winning back the Senate.\n\nVirginia 07: Republican Rep. Dave Brat may be too conservative for this Richmond-area district, which is home to the kind of affluent suburban voter who\u2019s not pleased with Trump. He faces former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger. Early returns could be an indication of whether suburbanites want to use their vote to protest the things they don\u2019t like about Trump or to reward Republicans for a booming economy.\n\nVirginia 10: Republicans looking for a sign that they\u2019ve got a prayer of keeping the House have to hope that Rep. Barbara Comstock \u2014 who\u2019s known as a good candidate in a very bad district for a Republican in the Trump era \u2014 holds on to her seat. Comstock has tried to distance herself from Trump in this quickly diversifying and well-heeled area. If she\u2019s able to even keep it close, Republicans will breathe a sigh of relief. If it\u2019s a blowout, Democrats will feel like they\u2019re starting the night right where they need to be.\n\n8 p.m. ET poll close\n\nFlorida Governor: Democrat Andrew Gillum wasn\u2019t the Democratic establishment\u2019s first choice as a gubernatorial nominee, so it\u2019s ironic that his candidacy could be what pulls Senate incumbent Bill Nelson over the finish line instead of the other way around. If Gillum, who is black, wins over Trump-aligned Ron DeSantis, it\u2019ll be a huge coup for Democrats in a swing state, and it\u2019ll send a message about diversity and resistance to Trump in a state that\u2019s must-win for him in 2020. If he struggles, that\u2019s bad news for Nelson and for Democrats in the state\u2019s eight competitive House races.\n\nMaine 02: Democrats have tried to defeat incumbent GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin in the last two cycles to no avail, but \u2014 as in other competitive seats \u2014 they feel more confident about their candidate this cycle. Jared Golden (D), a 35 year-old state representative who enlisted in the Marines after 9/11, is a bit in the mold of Conor Lamb \u2014 he\u2019s said he won\u2019t back Pelosi, he touts his bipartisan cred as a onetime aide to Republican Sen. Susan Collins, and he\u2019s used a firearm as a prop in several ads. Both Republicans and Democrats point to this race as a bellwether\n\nNew Jersey 03: Health care has been a defining issue of the midterms, and the center of the debate may be in south central New Jersey. This retiree-rich part of the state voted for Trump 51 percent to 45 percent in 2016. Incumbent Rep. Tom MacArthur (R), who was first elected in 2014, was a player during the Obamacare repeal negotiations, when he brokered a compromise between his own moderate GOP wing and conservatives to pass a repeal bill that ultimately failed in the Senate.\n\nMacArthur\u2019s work to dismantle Obamacare \u2014 even if his efforts favored a compromise bill that wasn\u2019t as harsh as conservatives wanted \u2014 has haunted him during his campaign against Democratic challenger Andy Kim, a national security adviser in the Obama White House. If Kim wins, it\u2019s hard to see how Democrats don\u2019t win back the House.\n\nTennessee Senate: If Democrats have a prayer of winning back the Senate, they\u2019ll almost definitely need to win in three GOP-held states: Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee. (That assumes that North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp loses her re-election bid.) Democratic candidate Phil Bredesen is a well-liked former governor who enjoys more popularity \u2014 but lower head-to-head poll numbers \u2014 than GOP opponent Marsha Blackburn. An early loss for Bredesen wouldn\u2019t completely seal Democrats\u2019 fate, but it would leave only two highly unlikely paths to Democratic victory: An unexpected win for Heitkamp or a long shot loss for Ted Cruz in Texas.\n\n9 p.m. ET poll close\n\nArizona Senate: Arizona\u2019s Senate contest between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally isn\u2019t just a must-win for Dems \u2014 it\u2019s a good barometer of how Latino turnout may look in other key states. High participation for Latinos may be great news for Democrats in neighboring Nevada as well as California\u2019s competitive House districts.\n\nMinnesota 01: Republicans are hoping for a rare pickup opportunity in this southern Minnesota district, which went for Trump by a whopping 53 to 38 percent. Republican Jim Hagedorn, the son of a former congressman, has run for the seat three times before. He faces former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Dan Feehan.\n\nOutside groups have hammered Feehan relentlessly, including with TV ads featuring Colin Kaepernick and George Soros. If Republicans don\u2019t win here, they\u2019re probably having a rough night. This is one of four competitive seats in the state \u2014 two held by Republicans and two by Democrats; a net gain of one seat for either side out of Minnesota probably signals how the race is going nationwide.\n\nMinnesota 02: Incumbent Republican Rep. Jason Lewis barely beat Democratic rival Angie Craig (D) in 2016, and the two are back for a rematch this cycle. Lewis took heat this year when journalists unearthed controversial comments he made about women and LGBT people (Craig is gay) on his conservative radio show. Between those comments, Lewis\u2019s pro-Trump voting record and the president\u2019s sinking approval in the state, Craig has a good shot here. The gender gap here could be a headline.\n\nNew York 19: This Catskills-area district swung hard for Trump in 2016 after going for Barack Obama by six points in 2012. Democrats nominated Rhodes Scholar and Harvard law graduate Antonio Delgado to face Republican John Faso. Republican attacks on Delgado from outside groups have almost exclusively focused on rap lyrics Delgado, who is black, wrote a decade ago. Polling in the race hasn\u2019t been conclusive, but this is the kind of district where Democrats could start building a substantial majority if Delgado wins.\n\nTexas Senate: Plenty of ink has been spilled about race between Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke and Republican Ted Cruz, so we won\u2019t relive it here. We\u2019ll be very surprised if O\u2019Rourke gets within 2-3 points of Cruz, but there are two things to watch here: How much O\u2019Rourke\u2019s star power in urban areas boosts Democrats in competitive Houston and Dallas-area House races, and how much of the electorate is made up of Latinos. (In 2014, it was just 17 percent, compared to 24 percent in 2016.)\n\n11 p.m. ET poll close\n\nCalifornia 45: There are more than 10 House races to watch in California \u2014 many in the Orange County area and several that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Maybe the most revealing one is Rep. Mimi Walters\u2019 seat in the inland O.C. Republicans early on thought Walters was doing all the right things to stay safe despite the district\u2019s recent blue tinge, but Democrat Katie Porter has relentlessly messaged on Walter\u2019s health care and tax bill votes. California is slow to count votes, but this may be the race that launched a thousand think pieces on Nov. 7.\n\nWashington 08: Republican candidate Dino Rossi is hoping that this is finally his year. A failed candidate for two statewide offices in the last decade, Rossi has been well-funded in his attempt to fill the open seat of retiring Dave Reichert. But this is still a district that voted for Clinton by three points, and Democrats have tried to paint Rossi as a de facto incumbent. That\u2019s a contrast to their candidate, newcomer and pediatrician Kim Schrier, who\u2019s posted huge fundraising numbers. This is another race where voters in a largely suburban area will choose between a familiar Republican and a newcomer Democrat.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Ullah planned to die in a failed Dec. 11 pipe bombing intended to maim or kill commuters. Ullah's attack occurred in a pathway underneath Times Square linking the subway to Manhattan's Port Authority bus terminal.\n\n\"I was angry with Donald Trump because he says he will bomb the Middle East and then he will protect his nation,\" Ullah told the judge after the verdict was announced and the jury left the room.\n\nJudge Richard Sullivan told him: \"Right now is not the time for a statement.\"\n\nUllah was found guilty on six charges, which included provision of material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, use of a weapon of mass destruction, and a terrorist attack against mass transportation systems.\n\nEmergency service workers load Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old Bangladeshi man suspecting of setting off a bomb at New York City's Port Authority Bus Terminal, into an ambulance on Dec. 11, 2017.\n\n\u201cLate last year, Akayed Ullah detonated a bomb during the bustle of morning rush hour under the Port Authority Bus Terminal,\" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said Tuesday. \"Ullah\u2019s sinister purpose was to harm and terrorize as many innocent people in his path as possible, by using deadly violence to make a political statement.\"\n\nBerman said Ullah\u2019s conviction was a unanimous jury decision and that the timing of the verdict, the day of midterms elections, \"fittingly underscores the core principles of American democracy.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Rebekah Donaleski said that Ullah's bomb was strapped to this chest, loaded with metal screws to serve as shrapnel and triggered by a nine-volt battery in his pocket.\n\n\"He designed it. He built it. ... He picked the time. He picked the location,\" Donaleski said. His goal, she added, was \"to terrorize Americans in the name of ISIS.\"\n\nThe crude pipe bomb \u2014 which also contained Christmas lights according to a criminal complaint \u2014 did not go off as planned but seriously burned Ullah in the process. No one else was injured.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney George Turner said Ullah pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group prior to the attack, although Ullah's defense attorneys denied that in his trial. Ullah's attorney Julia Gatto said in her opening statements that there was no evidence Ullah took direction from the Islamic State and claimed prosecutors were overreaching in their charges.\n\nUllah, who has a green card, came to the United States in 2011 after his uncle won a visa lottery program and sponsored his nephew. He was \"a deeply troubled young man who wanted to take his own life\" to send a message about the mistreatment of Muslims, Gatto said.\n\nEvidence against Ullah presented by the government included a Facebook posting he made while riding in the subway to Manhattan from Brooklyn on the morning of the attack that read, \"Trump you failed to protect your nation.\"\n\nUllah also posted a statement that he believed would be understood by members and supporters of ISIS to convey that he carried out the attack in their name, according to a criminal complaint from January.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Govin had been on death row for the murder of four people.\n\nBoth inmates were housed in single cells at San Quentin State Prison, and the deaths are being investigated as suicides, officials said.\n\nUrdiales was sentenced to death on Oct. 5 for the murders of 23-year-old Robbin Brandley, 31-year-old Maryann Wells, 29-year-old Julie McGhee, 20-year-old Tammie Erwin and 32-year-old Denise Maney.\n\nAuthorities said Urdiales killed the women while he was stationed at various military facilities in Southern California.\n\nThe 54-year-old was previously convicted for the murders of three Illinois women, 21-year-old Cassie Corum, 25-year-old Lori Uylaki, 22-year-old Lynn Huber.\n\nUrdiales was sentenced to death in Illinois in 2004, but the sentence was commuted in 2011 to life in prison.

In New York City, where lines were out the door, election officials said rain had wet ballots and caused scanners to jam.\n\nPolling times in parts of North Carolina and Georgia were extended after voting issues and delays.\n\nHomeland Security officials said they detected no successful hacking attempts.\n\nVoting hours were extended at several locations in Georgia, a battleground state where Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic leader in the state House, was neck and neck with Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp in the race for governor. Georgia has been roiled by claims of attempted voter hacking and the purging of tens of thousands of voters, most of them black, from its rolls.\n\nIn Fulton County, home to Atlanta, the capital, a judge extended voting by two hours, until 9 p.m., at Pittman Park Recreational Center because the site had too few voting machines. Voting was extended by three hours, until 10 p.m., at the Archer and Booker T. Washington polling places on the campus of Morehouse College because of significant delays.\n\nThe machines at Anderson-Livsey Elementary School in Snellville stopped running after their batteries died. A spokesman for Gwinnett County said that the appropriate power cords had to be retrieved and that the machines were working again around 9:15 a.m.\n\nAlexander said that only a couple of poll workers were checking IDs and that the line \"moved at a snail's pace.\" A judge ordered that the polling station stay open a half-hour late, until 7:30 p.m.\n\nThat wasn't the only issue in Snellville, a small city in suburban Atlanta: At Annistown Elementary School, faulty polling machines caused a 25-minute delay after the site opened, and people weren't given paper ballots, as is protocol.\n\nThe issue was fixed, a Gwinnett County spokesman told NBC News. A judge later ordered that the Annistown polls remain open until 7:25 p.m.\n\nAt a news conference outside a polling site in Snellville, former Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter said people waited in line for 4\u00bd hours in some cases. But he was hopeful \u2014 even if some voters were visibly annoyed.\n\n\"If they had to leave, they're all coming back,\" said Carter, a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nSheer record turnout also caused some of the problems as voters in many areas showed up to find too few voting machines, poll workers or ballots.\n\nLong lines hundreds of students deep waited to vote at the Palo Verde West voting center at Arizona State University in Tempe as officials scrambled to set up more voting booths outside to meet the demand.

Congress this year approved $380 million to help safeguard voting systems.

But they said they assume that foreign influence efforts will continue with the same kind of disinformation that's been widespread in recent months.\n\nEarlier, DHS officials said problems caused by severe weather in the Deep South and along the East Coast had been minimal.\n\nStill, technical difficulties and voter confusion abounded in some states.\n\nIn Geauga County, Ohio, east of Cleveland, some people reported that when they went vote, they were incorrectly told that they had already filed for absentee ballots.\n\nDebbie Reiter, director of the Board of Elections in Geauga County, said that staff was being sent to the county's 35 voting locations to fix the issue and that all precincts in Chardon, the county seat, had already been fixed.\n\nSign up for Breaking News Alerts from NBC News\n\nThe problem occurred because of a miscommunication with the county's vendors \u2014 specifically, \"the voter registration system did not talk with the electronic poll pads,\" Reiter said.\n\nVoters in five of the seven Indiana counties served by the voting technology company Elections Systems & Software, or ES&S, experienced difficulties checking in to vote.\n\nBrown, Carroll, Elkhart, Hancock and Johnson counties, which have a combined population of more than 450,000 people, all experienced problems.

By about 8 a.m., a worker came carrying the right key, Parris said, and she was able to vote a half-hour later.\n\nShe remained upset, however, that it took over two hours for her to cast a ballot.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense that one person had one key to open up this community center,\" she said.\n\nChristopher Thomas Queen is accused of threatening to shoot workers at a western Pennsylvania polling place after they told him he wasn't registered to vote on Tuesday.

He responded with an emailed statement Tuesday morning.\n\n\"The fact that this story and others have been brought to the public is incredibly painful but will become a catalyst for me seeking the right help for myself,\" Goldwasser stated in an email. \"It is sad that despite the fact that I have been able to help many people over the years who have suffered from the effects of child sexual abuse and sexual addiction, I obviously was unable to help myself. There is no justification for my personal behavior and I deeply regret the pain I have caused people in my personal life.\"\n\nGoldwasser did not immediately respond to NBC News' follow-up questions regarding his current stance on so-called conversion therapy, whether the gay dating profiles unearthed by Truth Wins Out were his and his response to Besen's public claims that Goldwasser is misleading and defrauding patients.\n\nIn a message posted to Truth Wins Out\u2019s website, Besen explained that the organization \u201cdoes not engage in the outing of people participating in ex-gay programs unless there is overwhelming hypocrisy, exchange of commerce, and the threat of harm to LGBT youth.\u201d Goldwasser\u2019s outing \u201cpasses all three tests,\u201d the post stated.\n\n\u201cGoldwasser can\u2019t claim his personal life is none of our business when trying to \u2018cure\u2019 LGBT people is his business,\u201d Besen continued in the online message. \u201cHere is a case where a charlatan is committing consumer fraud by misleading clients and adversely affecting their mental health.\u201d\n\nSo-called gay conversion therapy, also known as \"ex-gay therapy\" or \"reparative therapy,\" attempts to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. It has widely been discredited by medical and mental-health associations, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association. The American Psychiatric Association stated that the \"potential risks\" of this type of therapy \"are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient.\"\n\nAccording to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, approximately 700,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults have undergone conversion therapy at some point in their lives, including about 350,000 who received this treatment as adolescents. Since 2012, 14 states and Washington, D.C., passed laws banning the practice for minors, according to the LGBTQ think tank Movement Advancement Project.\n\nGoldwasser, however, has been a proponent of this controversial practice for more than a decade. In 2006, he co-authored a paper titled \u201cHolistic Therapy: A Comprehensive, Clinical Approach to the Treatment of SSA,\u201d where SSA stands for same-sex attraction. In it, he pathologizes homosexuality, comparing it to obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nIn 2010, he wrote an article for conservative website Free Republic where he promoted the now-defunct organization Jews Offering New Alternatives to Homosexuality (JONAH), which Quartz recently described as \u201cthe biggest Jewish gay \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 organization.\u201d\n\nA profile on Psychology Today that claims to be Goldwasser states that he has \u201cextensively worked with a variety of trauma-related challenges such as personality disorders, especially narcissism, OCD and other anxiety disorders, mood disorders, relationship difficulties, and unwanted bisexuality.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Get the Better newsletter.\n\nBy Vivian Manning-Schaffel\n\nSomehow, we are now under the impression that how busy we are is supposed to equate how successful we are.

They found people tend to perceive they have less time than they actually do, get less done as a result and are less likely to take on \u2018extended time tasks\u2019 during those unscheduled pockets that could potentially make them more money.\n\nBerger described always feeling behind the 8-ball, and that her calendar was controlling her, instead of the other way around. That\u2019s why preparation is a big part of Berger\u2019s prescriptive M.O. In \u201cGet it Together,\u201d she helps readers consider how attending to small details, like picking out your clothes, packing your gym bag and making to-do lists the night before, can improve their lives and routines. \u201cI think being hyper-aware of the small wins the things that make you feel like you have it together,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing prepared gives you confidence.\u201d\n\nReclaiming wasted time\n\nAn integral part of this is figuring out how to schedule your day in a way that allows for your humanity. \u201cCorporate culture tells us that we need to be avail 24/7,\u201d says Berger. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the employers to change their mentality, because people are too stressed and they\u2019re cracking. And employees are going to have to set boundaries and not put up with it.\u201d\n\nPart of this is unplugging and when it comes to unplugging, Berger practices what she preaches. She recently took her work email off of her phone and enacted a hard stop to her work day. \u201cMy friends give me guilt about being a CEO and not being connected all the time. I hope to give people the confidence to say \u2018no\u2019 and not be on the phone and eat dinner,\u201d she says.\n\nBerger says her methods have enabled her to be more engaged and present when she is working, and the benefits have trickled down in unexpected ways. \u201cThere\u2019s something very beneficial about handling emails when you\u2019re in the mindset of working, and not when you\u2019re trying to relax,\u201d she explains. \u201cI got a rejection email the other day \u2014 as CEO, I get them every day. Because I took my email off of my phone and saw the email during my workday, I was able to respond in a sophisticated, professional way. Two months ago, when I still had everything connected, I would\u2019ve seen the email before I went to bed and wouldn\u2019t have slept.\u201d\n\nKnowing when to disconnect can improve efficiency \u2014 both in and out of the office. For this reason, Berger insists her employees unplug during their weekly planning meetings. \u201cWe used to have meetings that would go on for hours, and people would go off on tangents. Now, we have a closed computer policy and it\u2019s cut our meetings down to 20 minutes,\u201d she says.\n\nShe also insists employees draft agendas before meetings. \u201cJust the simple act of planning for the conversation can help you take control of your time,\u201d she says. This also extends to goal-setting, which is the focus of a chapter in her book and another part of Berger\u2019s success strategy. \u201cYou should have your top three goals memorized and shout them from the rooftops,\u201d she says. \u201cBreaking them down into an actionable plan is just as important.\u201d\n\nWhen planning for success, one must also consider the possibility of failure. Berger says the most constructive way to deal with failure is to know how you\u2019re likely to cope, and figure out how to stay productive while coping. \u201cWhen things go wrong, the show must go on. This extends to the workplace. It\u2019s so important to know what works for you, and activate that solution. If I let a failure derail my entire day, I\u2019ve created seven more problems. If I go on to the next thing on my list, I can circle back and cope when I\u2019m in a clear head space,\u201d says Berger.\n\nHow to be productive instead of busy\n\nTo be more productive during your workday, Berger recommends you:\n\nFind your focus. With so many notifications and alarms going off, workdays are filled with distractions that can derail our productivity. Berger recommends committing to whatever it takes to stay on task. \u201cIf you have to throw your phone across the room or put on headphones to tune out distractions, so be it,\u201d she says. Don\u2019t work blindly. When you set about doing a task, do so with specific intention, says Berger. Don\u2019t just sit down to answer emails \u2014 five hours can pass. Instead, Berger recommends approaching emails or other tasks with an action plan considering a desired outcome. Align your to-do list with your calendar. By blocking out time on your calendar to tackle to-dos, you won\u2019t be derailed by meetings and lingering action items.\n\nThough some of these solutions seem like common sense, sometimes it helps to be reminded that the devil can be in the details. Unless you plan for that, of course.\n\nMORE TIPS FOR A BETTER DAY\n\nWant more tips like these? NBC News BETTER is obsessed with finding easier, healthier and smarter ways to live.

Those funds would then be used to help address the city\u2019s housing crisis and provide aid for the estimated 7,000 homeless people living on the streets of San Francisco.\n\nThe proposition gained national attention after its most vocal billionaire supporter, Marc Benioff, the Salesforce founder and co-chief executive officer, began to spar on social media with other tech titans, including Jack Dorsey, chief executive officer of Square and Twitter.\n\nBenioff, who helms San Francisco\u2019s largest employer and already has his name on a hospital in the city, has donated more than $7.8 million in personal and corporate money to the campaign to pass the proposition. He also tweeted about it and even set up a phone bank for volunteers in the newly opened Salesforce Tower.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco has never had a homeless crisis as big as this and it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Benioff recently tweeted.\n\nIn another, he wrote: \u201cUnfortunately, some C.E.O.s still are myopic & believe that they have a fiduciary duty to shareholders alone, with little or no responsibility to the communities in which they do business.\u201d\n\nOne of the things about being the largest employer in San Francisco is my customers are coming here, my employees are here, & I have never seen as huge an impact on my business as it is with homelessness. Prop C: Big businesses like mine pay, you don\u2019t. https://t.co/PY625wvzxP \u2014 Marc Benioff (@Benioff) November 4, 2018\n\nIf Proposition C passes, companies with more than $50 million in gross annual receipts will be taxed on any gross annual receipt revenue in San Francisco. The city already has a gross receipts tax, which is usually calculated by taking a company's global revenue and multiplying it by an \"apportionment percentage,\" which is based on their business category. Depending on their category, businesses could pay an additional tax between .175 percent to .69 percent.\n\nSalesforce, the largest employer in San Francisco, would pay around $10 million per year, according to estimates, while Square, a financial services company one-third the size of Salesforce, would pay more.\n\nThat\u2019s just the beginning of the problem with Proposition C, according to other billionaires, who have sparred with Benioff on Twitter about it over the past few weeks.\n\nDorsey personally donated $125,000 to oppose Proposition C, according to the San Francisco Ethics Commission disclosures posted online. Stripe, a payments processor, donated $419,999 to defeat Proposition C, according to online records. Lyft dropped $100,000 to oppose it. Mark Pincus, the billionaire founder of Zynga, a mobile gaming company, has also been vocal about voting no.\n\nTwitter has not taken a public stance on the issue. However, Dorsey shared his thoughts on the platform, speaking of the \u201cunfairness\u201d in the proposition.\n\nHypothetically Square could pay over $20m more in 2019, while Salesforce (4x bigger than Sq) pays less than $10m. Taxes would grow at rates multiple times our adj. revenue, which no company can sustain. Not an issue for Salesforce/Twitter, but unfair to Sq and fintech startups. \u2014 jack (@jack) October 19, 2018\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to pay our taxes. We just want to be treated fairly with respect to our peer companies, many of whom are 2-10x larger than us,\u201d Dorsey wrote on October 19. \u201cOtherwise we don\u2019t know how to practically grow in the city. That\u2019s heartbreaking for us as we love SF and want to continue to help build it.\u201d\n\nPatrick Collison, co-founder and CEO of Stripe, said voting on Proposition C isn\u2019t a matter of \u201cbeing for the homeless or against them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile well-intentioned, it is San Francisco\u2019s largest-ever tax increase, and comes with no systemic changes or effective accountability,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nEven San Francisco\u2019s new mayor, London Breed, opposed the proposition.\n\nBreed ran on a platform of solving the homeless crisis but said she does not support Proposition C because the city already needs to audit the more than $300 million it is spending on homelessness.\n\nFunding has \u201cincreased dramatically in recent years with no discernible improvement in conditions,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cBefore we double the tax bill overnight, San Franciscans deserve accountability for the money they are already paying.\u201d\n\nBreed also cited a report from the city economist\u2019s office, which estimated that Proposition C would shave $240 million off of San Francisco\u2019s gross domestic product every year and potentially risk companies leave San Francisco, taking their headquarters and jobs to other cities.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco can\u2019t solve homelessness simply by writing even-larger checks to itself,\u201d she said.", "FBI joins search for abducted North Carolina Girl copied!\n\nFederal law enforcement authorities have been called in to help find a Lumberton, North Carolina girl whose kidnapping from the front yard of her family's mobile home Monday morning prompted an Amber Alert.

Amazon opened its first store with checkout-free shopping and automatic billing almost two years ago, and self-checkout at Walmart, Target, grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and some department stores is further reducing the need for people manning registers.\n\nTechnology continues to race ahead. The question is whether artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, and other developments will cut job opportunities for people who may have few alternatives.\n\nCashier jobs are hardly the only ones eyed for replacement. Short squat robots in Washington, D.C. roam the city, delivering take-out food to customers. Self-driving cars could eventually replace cab drivers and people moonlighting for Uber or Lyft.\n\n\"Walmart is embracing the technology of a company called Bossa Nova Robotics,\" said Howie Choset, a professor at The Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. The company, started by a former graduate student of Choset, makes inventory robots. \"It's a tall, skinny robot with lots of cameras and bright lights,\" Choset said. The device roams up and down the aisles late at night, taking count of products on the shelves. Inventory counts at retail stores have long been a staple activity of regular employees or temp workers.\n\nThose who support various forms of automation point to historical patterns back to the Industrial Revolution. \"I do think there are going to be jobs that are going to be created that are net new,\" said Todd Lohr, a KPMG principal in the consulting firm's digital enablement practice. \"I think there's opportunity for organization to do right by the workforce.\"\n\nThe theory is that people will shift into new types of work. Drones that make deliveries will need specialized maintenance personnel. Computerized manufacturing equipment requires people to run, program, and monitor it.\n\nPeople need training\n\nThe problem is a \"misconception\" about whether the U.S. labor force is dynamic, said Fordham University Senior Lecturer of Economics Giacomo Santangelo. There may be new jobs, but displaced workers likely lack the training and education to smoothly move into them.\n\n\"You can't just keep saying new work is created where old work goes away,\" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of HFS Research. \"It becomes an issue of when these lower-end jobs go away. Where do these people go? We don't know.\"\n\nTiming is also a problem. Although it will likely take \"10 to 20 years\" for companies to fully embrace new technologies, according to MIT Sloan School Professor Erik Brynjolfsson, change has been proceeding at a pace never before seen. He points to the need for entrepreneurship that can reinvent ideas of work and jobs for everyone.\n\nHowever, the results are still far off. Short-term suggestions that some make, like having people become entrepreneurs who create handmade crafts, can be unrealistic.\n\n\"The solution is not to slow down technology but to speed up our response.\"\n\n\"It takes people years to learn [how to do the work],\" Santangelo said.\n\nAs Brynjolfsson says, the country needs a public discussion on the issues and policies that can help transition people from dying occupations to ones that hold future promise. \"Society as a whole has to address education, training, and the disruption of jobs,\" he said. \"The solution is not to slow down technology but to speed up our response. Government, companies, and individuals can all make a difference.\"\n\nBut even though President Donald Trump's administration this year started to look at the question of AI and automation with a task force, progress remains far outpaced by the changes happening today.\n\nThe next economic calamity\n\nWhat worries Fersht is that while companies have become \"less obsessed with slashing head count\" at the moment, that could change with another financial disaster.\n\n\"When we get another downturn and the mentality shifts, there are a lot more tools at the disposal of companies to drive out costs,\" Fersht said. \"The capability is there like never before.\"\n\nThen the issue becomes social, and not just economic, said Arne Kalleberg, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Extensive job losses in communities could drive long-time residents out, put pressure on families, and lead to poverty and economic upheaval.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Miles Howard\n\nToday, a portion of Americans will vote in the most contested and emotionally charged midterm elections that many of us have witnessed. But the crucial word there is \u201cportion,\u201d because statistically speaking, Americans don\u2019t usually vote en masse. And there\u2019s one demographic in particular that has routinely underperformed at the ballot box on Election Day: millennials.\n\nVoting-eligible young adults (of which I am one) have been profiled and pilloried for their reluctance to take part in elections. Last month, an NBC News/GenForward survey found that just over one third of Millennials said they probably or definitely will vote in this year\u2019s midterms. And what\u2019s wild is that this underwhelming estimate is actually a slight uptick from the 2016 presidential race and the 2014 midterms, when millennial turnout didn\u2019t get close to 30 percent, according to the Census.\n\nScores of young people sitting out elections isn\u2019t exactly a new thing. (Baby boomers won\u2019t admit it, but even they were less reliable voters during their youth.) But what is unique about millennials is the fact that in 2019, we will become the largest living generation in America. This grants us sizable political power that could decide elections. If we show up.\n\nVoting-eligible young adults (of which I am one) have been profiled and pilloried for their reluctance to take part in elections.\n\nThe problem is that when it comes to persuading ambivalent millennials to vote, most people are doing it wrong. Since the day after Trump clinched the presidency in 2016, the question I\u2019ve heard many boomers, Gen-Xers, and even some of my contemporaries ask is, \u201cHow we get all these lazy millennials to wake up and vote?\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s the absolute worst way to approach this challenge.\n\nAs the author of a book about my generation, I\u2019ve interviewed hundreds of millennial voters and non-voters. And what I\u2019ve learned is you have to prove to young people that you understand where they're coming from. Quite often, millennials don\u2019t vote because they don\u2019t believe that our political system can be a vehicle for change and progress and they don\u2019t think their vote will make a difference. This is especially true for young people who volunteered for President Barack Obama, for example, and then watched in disbelief as Wall Street was given a slap on the wrist following the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn other words, when disillusioned millennials say that \u201cthe system\u201d is controlled by the worst kind of elites, they\u2019ve got a point. But when they claim that voting won\u2019t make a difference, they\u2019re incorrect. That\u2019s the window through which you can begin to turn them.\n\nHere\u2019s how you do it. The first and hardest step to engage a millennial non-voter involves putting your anger aside. Shaming millennials into voting almost never works. Getting mad might satisfy your ego, but it won\u2019t bring you closer to reaching your goal, which is persuading a new millennial voter to cast a ballot on November 6. You can (and should) still ask them, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you voting?\u201d But tone is everything. Ask sincerely, not with sarcasm or indignation.\n\nIf you do this right, you\u2019ll likely be rewarded with a grim monologue about how all politicians are corrupt because our electoral system forces them to spend so much time fundraising for their next race. The second step is conceding that some of these things are true. Most politicians are beholden to the donor class and often have to be pushed by voters to honor campaign promises and fight for their constituents. This is the nature of our politics today and feeling disgusted by it is entirely understandable. It\u2019s not how democracy is supposed to work.\n\nNow comes the most important trick of the conversation \u2014 you have to re-frame voting. Millennials are used to hearing that if they just vote, all the problems plaguing their generation would vanish. This, of course, is not true and millennials know that. Voting today is more like a choice between having a chipmunk or a wolverine attached to your neck. And that\u2019s how you should start your sell \u2014 not as the end-all, be-all of resistance, but as an essential act of harm reduction. Fixing America\u2019s electoral system in a broader sense will take years if not decades, but that fight will be much more possible if our elected officials aren\u2019t railroading destructive policies through Congress.\n\nThe coup de grace of your argument is simply reminding your millennial audience of what those policies can look like. Democrats, for instance, are not looking to erase the legal definition of what it means to be transgender. They\u2019re not blowing racist dog-whistles about migrant caravans and fanning the flames of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

Jeff Overs / BBC/Reuters\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office said Tuesday that it would impose fines of $78,370 each on Leave.EU and Banks\u2019 company, Eldon Insurance Services, for sending insurance marketing to Leave.EU subscribers without their consent. It said the mistake was a \u201cserious\u201d breach of U.K. data laws.\n\nBanks, who was pictured with Trump and leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage soon after Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, issued a typically blunt response on Twitter.\n\n\"Gosh we communicated with our supporters and offered them a 10 percent Brexit discount after the vote!

White\n\nNo matter which political party takes the wheel in Congress, American drivers are getting a win this Election Day. In spite of new sanctions curtailing Iran\u2019s oil exports, prices at the pump are plummeting. According to one expert, drivers in certain parts of the country could see gas prices drop below $2 a gallon this fall.\n\n\u201cThere are a few stations in the South where the price of gasoline is under $2 and a couple of thousand points where the price is below $2.25 already,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. The lowest prices currently can be found in Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas.\n\nAccording to AAA, the national gas price average on Monday was the lowest it\u2019s been in six months. The state with the cheapest average price was Delaware at $2.44, and seven other states were below the $2.50 mark. In the continental U.S., the state with the highest average price was California, at $3.75. Even drivers in Hawaii, where gas is almost always the most expensive, were getting a bit of a break with an average price of $3.91.\n\n\u201cMotorists likely have seen the worst in terms of retail prices for the year,\u201d said AAA spokeswoman Jeanette Casselano. \u201cIf the crude oil market remains steady, gas prices are likely to continue to fall as much as 10 cents in the near-term.\u201d AAA data shows that the average price of gas this year is still higher than it was at the same point in the calendar for the last three years, but some analysts predict it could touch levels last seen in the final months of 2017.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a big downturn,\u201d said Patrick DeHaan, chief petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. At $2.73, the current national average has fallen nearly 20 cents in the last month, he said. \u201cI think prices may inch lower for the next couple of weeks,\u201d he said. DeHaan predicted that the run of lower prices could last through Thanksgiving or early December, and estimated that prices could drop another 10 or even 20 cents from their current level.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of why we\u2019re in the current environment has to do with some of the jitters we\u2019ve seen on Wall Street in the past month \u2014 the overall sentiment has been a bit of anxiousness, and of course, uncertainty over lingering trade issues with China have really pushed the market down,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the longer term, the Iran sanctions could push the price of oil higher, DeHaan said, but he noted that waivers granted to China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Greece and Italy would keep at least some Iranian oil flowing into the global market. \"It\u2019s fairly clear to me as an analyst that in issuing waivers on Iran, President Donald Trump is basically trying to soften the blow on fallout from the deal. He wants cheaper oil prices,\u201d DeHaan said.\n\nKloza suggested gas prices could remain in a trough through the end of the year \u2014 giving Americans more money in their wallets around the holidays. \u201cIt means they\u2019ll have a little bit more money to spend inside the stores, to go to the movies or to spend at restaurants,\u201d he said.\n\nIf nothing else, this gives politicians one less thing to bicker about. \u201cGasoline is not going to be a topic for the election and perhaps six weeks ago, we thought it might be,\u201d Kloza said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Two images side by side show an actor, pop culture figure or animal looking chipper, young or fresh in the first image. In the second, the same entity looks gruff, tough or worn.\n\nIn one example, journalist Whitney Friedlander tweeted an image of actress Elisabeth Moss as Margaret \"Peggy\" Olson in the AMC show \"Mad Men,\" strolling down a hallway with a cigarette in her mouth as her 2016 representation. Her 2018 comparison showed Moss as Offred, the subservient handmaid in Hulu's \"The Handmaid's Tale.\"\n\nAnother compared actress Charlize Theron looking glamorous on a red carpet as a 2016 depiction with her dystopian character from the film \"Mad Max\" as the 2018 portrayal.\n\nIt's unclear who started the meme or when the first one was posted to Twitter, but the format was being used as early as Sunday.\n\nWhile some put different side-by-sides, others simply posted the same image twice, showing that even though a lot can change in two years, many people were still feeling the same as they did in 2016.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Instead she refused to let that devastating personal tragedy \u2014 and a national flashpoint on racial violence \u2014 destroy her.\n\nEmboldened and unbowed, McSpadden is making her voice heard by running for the Ferguson City Council in 2019. In doing so, McSpadden joins other black mothers striving to make a big impact on racial justice by taking matters into their own hands, politically and spiritually.\n\nShe is joined in her political aspirations by, among others, Lucia \u201cLucy\u201d McBath, whose son was fatally shot in 2012; she was moved to run after her teenage son Jordan Davis, who is black, was shot and killed in Jacksonville, Florida, by a white man who said the teen\u2019s music was too loud.. She handily won the Democratic nomination in Georgia\u2019s 6th congressional district in July and is now neck-and-neck with Rep. Karen Hendel, who only took the seat after the most expensive House race in history (against Jon Ossoff) in June 2017. The district is considered 14.7 percent more Republican than the national average.\n\nAnd, though she is not runnings for office, Sybrina Fulton \u2014 whose son, Trayvon Martin, was confronted, shot and killed while walking home \u2014 has dedicated her life to social change after her son became a powerful symbol for the Black Lives Matter movement. Her work includes advocacy for gun control and a retreat for other mothers whose lives have been touched by the violent deaths of their children.\n\nAt the Million Hoodie March on March 21, 2012, in New York City, I held the microphone up to Sybrina as she spoke from the heart, as only a mother can. \u201cOur son was not committing any crime. Our son is your son. I want you guys to stand up for justice and stand up for what\u2019s right,\u2019\u2019 she told the crowd.\n\nWomen like Sybrina, Lucy and Lesley endured with dignity and poise, despite being thrust into the glare of a national spotlight while grieving for their devastating losses. They are truly the unsung heroes in the struggle against racial violence and police brutality. They are determined to make sure no other black mothers and children suffer the same sorrowful fate.\n\nAnd even as they are speaking truth to power, they are also ready to be in power. They want to change the dynamics of government by taking their rightful seats at the table where laws are hammered out and critical decisions affecting their underrepresented communities are debated.\n\nIf Lesley wins a seat on the Ferguson City Council, she will become another recent member of color on a formerly majority-white council, helping to oversee the police department responsible for her son\u2019s death four years ago this month.\n\nA win for either would be a real, and not just a symbolic, win for all black members of their communities, giving them hope that their voices are heard and their lives do matter. What could be more effective, more gut-wrenchingly honest, than the wise, experienced thoughts of a City Council member whose young son died at the hands of the law? What could be more symbolic than a woman whose son was killed by a racist taking a seat in a newly-Democratic House to provide a strong, passionate voice for gun control on Capitol Hill and a leader on racial equity issues?\n\nI\u2019ve stood with McSpadden and Fulton \u2014 as well as too many other moms and grandmothers \u2014 as they told the world what it was like to have their young sons shot dead. I\u2019ve seen both Lesley and Sybrina behind closed doors in their personal anguish.\n\nThey have already overcome so much. After her son\u2019s death, McSpadden got her high school diploma, wrote a book (\u201cTell the Truth & Shame the Devil: The Life, Legacy, and Love of My Son Michael Brown\u201d) and testified in support of a police body camera bill in Missouri. On April 23 this year, she spoke at a panel discussion on police violence at Harvard University, saying, \u201cWe have to get behind people who look like us and get them in these elected seats so that they can really do what\u2019s right by the community, and I\u2019m going to start with me by running for the Ferguson City Council.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn the years after her son\u2019s death, McBath turned her pain into power and her struggle into activism by joining the Mississippi chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and becoming a strong-voiced advocate for gun reform.\n\nWe need more people like McSpadden and McBath who, in working to right wrongs where they live, can do right by all of us.\n\nChildren are often told to listen to their mothers. There\u2019s a reason for that: Moms often know what\u2019s best for their kids and will do anything to protect them.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nAll of the attention on control of Congress, the individual races, and President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign activity has obscured a much bigger story at play in American politics \u2014 we\u2019re on the cusp of the House changing hands for a third time in the last 12 years (2006, 2010, 2018?).\n\nAnother way to look at it: This could very well be the fourth-straight change midterm election, where at least one chamber of Congress flips (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018?).\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen this level of volatility since after World War II, when control of the House changed hands several times in the 1940s and 1950s. And like after World War II and the Great Depression, this country is in the midst of a political realignment that has created this volatility. The contested 2000 presidential election. 9/11. The Iraq War. The Great Recession. Obama. Trump.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Democrats will win control of Congress in tonight\u2019s election, although they\u2019re the strong favorites to regain the House. But we do know how volatile \u2014 and divided \u2014 our politics have become.\n\nAnd whichever party wins tonight will have just won a battle and not the war in these politically volatile times.\n\nWho made the better bet: Democrats, with independents? Or the GOP, with the base?\n\nFor all of tonight\u2019s central questions (Which party controls Congress? Does Trump get rebuked or rewarded? Just how big is that gender gap?), this might be the most fascinating one of all: What was the better political bet in 2018 \u2014 playing to the base or to the middle?\n\nTrump and GOP strategists made it all about that base; just see Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh at last night\u2019s rally with Trump in Missouri. But Democrats \u2014 especially in the Senate races in red/purple states like Arizona, Indiana, Missouri, Montana and Tennessee \u2014 focused their messages on the middle of the electorate.\n\nMaybe the best example of this base-versus-middle divide is the 50-50 Senate race in Arizona between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema (whose message was aimed at the middle) and Republican Martha McSally (who was playing more to the Trump base in this traditional GOP state).\n\nBe sure to see how independents break in Arizona and nationally. If Democrats are winning them by more than 10 points \u2014 our NBC/Marist poll of Arizona had Sinema up more than 20 points among indies \u2014 it\u2019s hard to see how they aren\u2019t going to win across the country.\n\nOn the other hand, if those independent margins are smaller and if GOP turnout and enthusiasm are through the roof, then that base approach will have been the smarter play\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Trump\u2019s two years in office is how he\u2019s focused almost exclusively on his base \u2014 the 40 percent to 45 percent of voters who approve of his job \u2014 at the expense of the rest of the electorate, including the middle.\n\nDoes the middle still exist in American politics? Or is it all about that base? We\u2019ll find out tonight.\n\nWhich Democrats have more success: The ones who played to the middle? Or the ones who boldly played to the base?\n\nHere\u2019s a related question on our mind: Which Democrats will have more success \u2014 the Dems in red/purple states who played more to the middle like Sinema in Arizona, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Phil Bredesen in Tennessee?\n\nOr the Dems in red/purple states who made bolder appeals to their base \u2014 Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Andrew Gillum in Florida and Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas?\n\nRace by race, here\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 path to winning back the House\n\nAs for the battle for the House, we\u2019re re-upping our road map how Democrats get to the net 23 seats they need to win control of Congress:\n\nThe Democratic Defense (6)\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: Democrats aren\u2019t playing defense very many places, and they can probably afford to (and expect to) lose a few seats.

Years before Crimea was annexed by Moscow in 2014,high-ranking Ukrainian officials alleged that Russian passports were being given out to local residents.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin sees Moscow\u2019s hand behind the alleged Hungarian meddling, which he believes is aiming to \u201cdestabilize the region and Ukraine in general.\u201d While Hungary is in the European Union and a NATO member, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has an amicable relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nUkraine is due to go to the polls in March. It has been trying to strengthen ties with the West since its pro-Russian government was toppled in 2014.\n\nKlimkin didn\u2019t provide any evidence of Russia\u2019s alleged involvement.

Michaela Rehle / Reuters file\n\n\u201cThe changing nature of Hungarian government with Orban being more aligned with autocracy and having links or a kind of common understanding with the Kremlin and Putin, suddenly makes Ukraine very nervous about Hungarian policy in Zakarpattia,\u201d Lutsevych said.\n\nBut that policy goes back decades, according to Balazs Jarabik, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nAfter losing much of its territory in the aftermath of World War I, Hungary has long tried to engage with and protect its ethnic communities abroad.\n\nJozsef Antall, the first democratically elected Hungarian prime minister, famously stated in 1990 that he considered himself the leader of 15 million Hungarians \u2014 not only the 10 million living within its borders.\n\nIn 2011, Hungary passed a law to make it easier for ethnic Hungarians living abroad to obtain citizenship. To date, more than one million Hungarian passports have been handed out to ethnic Hungarians in a handful of neighboring states \u2014 including Ukraine.\n\nBut despite Hungary\u2019s cornerstone policy of building symbolic ties with its communities abroad, the video that emerged from Berehove doesn\u2019t come across as a \u201ckosher\u201d practice to the government in Kyiv, according to Jarabik.\n\nEven though Hungary maintains that the granting of passports in Berehove was legal, he says the political climate means it is being seen as a potential threat in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFor Ukrainians, this reminds them of Russian practices and anything that reminds Ukrainians of Russian practices is obviously a security challenge,\u201d Jarabik said.\n\nHungarian officials have previously called suggestions that their policy in Zakarpattia is serving Russian interests \"an abject lie.\"\n\nJarabik said Ukraine might be using the footage and diplomatic spat as a way to \"mobilize patriotic voters.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cHungary has kind of become a sparring partner in this. And Hungary is not Russia ... Kyiv knows that there is no real threat from Hungary.\u201d\n\nLutsevych says instead of engaging in a blame game with Budapest, Kyiv needs to build meaningful dialogue with ethnic Hungarians in Zakarpattia.\n\n\u201cHungarian communities there are not willing to engage with Kyiv to discuss their problems,\u201d Lutsevych said. \u201cThey are more willing to engage with Budapest and that\u2019s not normal.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

And his top messaging strategist, Brendan Buck, tweeted just four days before Election Day, \u201cwe\u2019re going to spend all day and weekend talking about the strong economy, right?\u201d\n\nThe economy has continued to add jobs through the first 21 months of Trump\u2019s term at a similar pace as the last two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s term. Republicans point to their tax cuts and reduction of regulations as proof that their policies have helped to keep the economy growing.\n\nIt\u2019s a message that they say appeals to a broader swath of voters who might stay in the Republican fold despite unease over Trump's often divisive and combative rhetoric.\n\nBut Trump has stepped all over that message in an attempt to help Republicans running for Senate in states he won in 2016, including Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee, Montana and Texas.\n\nRyan and Trump spoke on the phone Sunday about the election. On the call, Ryan asked Trump to talk up the economy, according to a Politico report, a topic Trump has sidelined in favor of his focus on immigration.\n\nRyan downplayed the friction, telling Fox News on Monday night that his message is that Republicans can campaign on \u201cboth\u201d issues simultaneously.\n\nOn Monday, FoxNews.com published an op-ed from the president, who pointed to the economy as his closing argument for the elections. Touting the positive economic news, he wrote that \"these things didn\u2019t happen by accident. They happened because Republicans are putting American workers and families first.\"\n\nBut it might be too little, too late. One Republican strategist said that Rep. John Culberson, who is in a tough re-election bid in a solidly Republican district in the Houston area, was polling four points ahead of his opponent, Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, in the days after the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter Trump escalated his anti-immigrant rhetoric and visited Houston, internal polling showed Culberson down three points.\n\nIn some races, including Culberson's, \u201cthe certain tone and the certain issues he\u2019s chosen to focus on is not helpful\u201d the Republican strategist said.\n\nTrump\u2019s harsh immigration rhetoric could affect Republicans in tight House races in Florida\u2019s heavily agricultural 15th District, where migrant farm labor is an economic necessity, and its heavily Hispanic 26th District \u2014 both of which are in play on Tuesday. And Republicans are worried that it won\u2019t just affect districts with such particular demographic and economic ties to immigration issues.\n\n\u201cTrump going Trump on this prevented us from talking about the economy,\u201d said Florida-based Republican strategist Rick Wilson, who is a frequent critic of the president. \u201cThis is not a message that says \u2018hey, suburban women come back and vote Republican again.\u2019 If there\u2019s an exact opposite of that message, it\u2019s this stuff.\"\n\nOther vulnerable Republicans are trying to counter Trump by focusing their campaign on local issues. Rep. Jeff Denham, who represents an agriculture district with a large Hispanic population in central California, has ignored Trump's national messaging on immigration and instead focused largely on water, a crucial issue there.\n\nBut if Republicans lose a large number of seats, someone will be blamed.

But whether or not Democrats succeed, Trump will likely escalate his efforts to smash limits to his power.\n\nMy service with the Central Intelligence Agency taught me that leaders committed to self-preservation through authoritarianism do not curtail their efforts to dismantle checks on their power under the threat of accountability. They hasten them.\n\nIf Republicans hold the House and Senate, Trump will see evidence of national vulnerability. Emboldened, he will act more aggressively against threats to his presidency, including the special counsel\u2019s investigation and Congressional consideration of its findings.\n\nIf Republicans hold the House and Senate, Trump will see evidence of national vulnerability. Emboldened, he will act more aggressively.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the Democrats prevail in at least one chamber, Trump will not stand idly as oversight committees and the law encircle him. He will fear the consequences of his inaction more than those of any potential action.\n\nI sincerely hope that I\u2019m wrong, but Trump has given us no reason to expect otherwise. He is prepared for this moment and we are not \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nIn the months ahead, Trump and his far-right media allies will more thoroughly flood the country with conspiracies, lies and other disinformation to impede our ability to discern the truth about his corruption. Many well-intentioned Americans will probably succumb, resolving to refocus on matters closer to home, including family, work and friendships.\n\nHe will continue to allow and even normalize foreign disinformation in his favor, which will become more sophisticated, effective and increasingly encouraged and mimicked by his loyalists.\n\nHe will more brazenly pursue nationalist, illiberal policies to energize the far-right in order to maintain control over the GOP and provoke a more radical response from the far-left, which he will in turn use to justify additional anti-democratic measures.\n\nIf the Democrats win the House, Trump will frame their appropriate oversight as treason, sheer partisanship and personal hostility, exploiting any overreaches or missteps as evidence of his false narrative. This in turn will encourage his followers\u2019 utter contempt for evidence of his wrongdoing.\n\nHe will promote the idea that the midterm election was rigged and allege the illegitimacy of our democratic processes more regularly to inspire the public apathy will help suppress opposition voting in the future.\n\nHe will likely remove Attorney General Jeff Sessions to gain influence over Department of Justice investigations, which the president\u2019s Democratic opposition will tolerate due to their unwillingness to bear Session\u2019s flaws long enough to protect relevant probes.\n\nHe will more frequently claim a national security rationale for his actions and may, possibly with a new set of less independent defense advisors, exploit real crises to suspend basic freedoms and silence dissent.\n\nMost importantly, he will do whatever he can to use our greatest fears, frustrations and ambitions to turn us against each other, because uniting on higher ground in defense of the nation presents the greatest threat to him.\n\nTrump\u2019s hostility to our values and institutions is not a partisan problem; it is an American problem. We must recognize it as such and act accordingly.\n\nConservatives must begin to measure everything Trump does first by its impact on the health of the republic, not by partisan priorities. No party goal is more important than the protection of our liberty. Not one. Democrats must realize that a conservative\u2019s agreement with Trump on some policy matters does not indicate that they are part of the far-right, white nationalist movement; many still harbor serious concerns about the president.\n\nThough our political parties are increasingly divided, America as a whole is not. Most of us are still united by our commitment to liberty, equality and truth. In the next chapter of this presidency, our willingness to put these values first will define our future, whether it be free or otherwise.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nMUENSTER, Germany \u2014 A former enlisted SS man, 94, went on trial Tuesday in German juvenile court, charged with being an accessory to murder for crimes committed when he was worked as a guard at the Nazis' Stutthof concentration camp.\n\nJohann Rehbogen, who was under 21 at the time he served as a guard at the camp, is accused of working as a guard at the camp east of Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk, from June 1942 to about the beginning of September 1944.\n\nBecause he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.\n\nThere is no evidence linking him to a specific crime, but more than 60,000 people were killed at Stutthof and prosecutors argue that as a guard, he was an accessory to at least hundreds of those deaths.\n\nThe former German Nazi concentration camp Stutthof in Sztutowo, northern Poland. Mateusz Ochocki / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nStutthof prisoners were killed in a gas chamber, with deadly injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts or shot, starved and even forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, prosecutor Andreas Brendel said.\n\nThe former SS Sturmmann, roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist, does not deny serving in the camp during the war but has told investigators he was not aware of the killings and did not participate in them, Brendel said.\n\nRehbogen's attorney, Andreas Tinkl, has said his client will make a statement in the trial at the Muenster state court, which is scheduled to last until January, but it was not immediately clear when he would speak.\n\nRehbogen lives in the western municipality of Borken near the Dutch border. In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\"The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\" said the center's head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nMany survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor's office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the \"Einsatzgruppen.\"\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany's top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nFrom about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called \"work education camp\" where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nFrom mid-1944, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, which was overflowing, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Rich Schapiro, Andrew Blankstein and Tom Winter\n\nBefore he was transferred to a notoriously violent prison in West Virginia, Boston gangster and FBI snitch James \"Whitey\" Bulger was locked up at a Florida penitentiary known as a safe haven for marked men like him.\n\nDespite being in his late 80s and confined to a wheelchair, prison staffers said Bulger had little to worry about while living among the general population at the Coleman II penitentiary\u2013a mix of informants, gang dropouts, and others with targets on their back.\n\n\"We have a lot of snitches there,\" said Joe Rojas, who worked as a GED teacher at Coleman II until this August. \"But they're safe. Like that old saying, they're among thieves.\"\n\nBulger had it particularly good. \"He was in a wheelchair but he had money so he paid off a couple of the younger guys,\" Rojas said. \"They used to bring him his lunch. They used to bring him his breakfast. And they protected him.\"\n\nWhy Bulger was relocated to West Virginia remains an open question.\n\nInterviews with multiple current and former federal prison staffers\u2013wardens, investigators and medical personnel\u2013as well as a review of several internal prison documents revealed that several aspects of Bulger's transfer stand out as unusual and perplexing.\n\nThe current and former prison staffers believe that moving Bulger to the Hazelton penitentiary may have been the result of a series of bureaucratic failures that all added up to a \"death sentence,\" as one former prison investigator put it, or it may have been about unloading a troublesome inmate with little regard for where he ended up.\n\nThe official reason given for Bulger's transfer from Coleman was medical in nature \u2013 that the 89-year-old's health had improved enough to allow his relocation, according to prison files obtained by NBC News. Prison officials specified on his transfer paperwork that he completed treatment at a medical facility and was in good enough health to return to the general population.\n\nBut other prison records tell a different story. Bulger wasn't at a prison hospital receiving treatment before heading off to Hazelton. He was in fact locked up in solitary confinement.\n\nInstead of staying at Coleman, where prison workers said he was safe, Bulger was inexplicably shipped off to a general population unit at Hazelton, where he was beaten to death less than 12 hours after he arrived.\n\nCameron Lindsay, a retired warden at three federal facilities, called the case \"a shocking failure on multiple levels.\"\n\n\"There's absolutely no way Bulger should have been sent to Hazelton, and he sure as heck should never have been released to the compound at Hazelton,\" Lindsay told NBC News.\n\n\"It's difficult to imagine how and why so many people dropped the ball on this thing.\"\n\nVito Maraviglia, a retired federal prison special investigative agent, put it in even starker terms.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it looks like they gave him the death sentence,\" said Maraviglia, who spent 27 years monitoring high-risk inmates and evaluating security threats in arriving prisoners.\n\n\"And for people to say, I didn't know he'd get hurt there, it's an outright lie. Either they were extremely negligent or just a complete idiot and there had to be 10 idiots because a lot of people signed off on that.\"\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons, presented with a detailed list of questions, declined comment.\n\n\"For safety and security reasons, we do not discuss specific conditions of confinement or whether an inmate has had a disciplinary history,\" the agency said in a statement. \"We cannot comment further due to an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nMoving inmates between prisons is a common practice in the federal system. The transfers are done for multiple reasons \u2013 including serious disciplinary violations, a change in health status, a sudden security risk \u2013 and signed off on by a centralized unit in Texas and the two regional offices involved in the move.\n\nMoving an inmate like Whitey Bulger from one prison to another would not be business as usual, according to the current and former prison staffers.\n\nBulger, a notorious South Boston mobster who served as the inspiration for several books and Hollywood films, was among the most high-profile of federal prisoners. With his reputation as a mob turncoat and killer of women, he also would have had no shortage of enemies in a system that comprised 122 institutions and more than 150,000 inmates.\n\n\"He ratted out a lot of people,\" said Rojas, the prison teacher who also runs the local prison workers union near Coleman. \"You cannot put that person in, not just Hazelton, but any open yard. It's a death sentence.\"\n\nThe transfer process would have been started by Coleman II warden Charles Lockett, according to the current and former prison staffers.\n\nThe request, after passing through layers of federal prison bureaucracy and ultimately getting the approval from the regional offices, would have generated paperwork that would eventually cross the desk of Hazelton warden Joe Coakley, the current and former prison staffers said.\n\nBulger's dark past was not covered up on his intake screening form. It described him as a \"Boston mobster involved in numerous murders and acts of violence\u2026High Profile Case.\" His severity level was marked off as \"greatest.\"\n\nStill, Bulger was placed into the general population in a prison considered among the system's most violent.\n\n\"The Hazelton warden and his staff were ultimately responsible, unless, of course, ordered by a higher authority, for deciding whether or not Bulger would be released to their general population,\" said Lindsay.\n\n\"The prudent move would have been to safeguard Bulger by isolating him in the facility's Special Housing Unit while determining how and why he was transferred to Hazelton.\"\n\nBob Hood, a former federal Bureau of Prisons chief of internal affairs and warden at the ADX Florence supermax prison in Colorado, agreed.\n\n\"Personally, I would have placed an inmate like Bulger on protective custody status on any of the federal prisons where I served as warden,\" Hood said. \"He would always be considered a target because of his criminal background, status as informant, and age. Never, ever, to be placed in general population status.\"\n\nThe official code listed on Bulger's transfer papers was 332 for \"medical treatment completed.\" The description of 332 is as follows: \"Return from medical referral center to general population after treatment for medical/physical treatment.\"\n\nBut the classification is baffling \u2013 none of Bulger's paperwork indicates that he spent time at a treatment facility in recent months. In April, Coleman II officials did try to transfer Bulger to a prison hospital but the request was denied. All the while, Bulger remained in solitary confinement for reasons unknown, prison records show.\n\n\"They're saying it's medical, but there has to be something else behind it,\" said Maraviglia, the prison investigator. \"Why would they transfer him to Hazelton because of a medical thing? All of a sudden all his past security concerns aren't a concern anymore? It makes absolutely no sense.\"\n\nBulger's internal records contain another detail that stands out as unusual, according to current and former federal prison workers. He was listed as a medical care level two out of four, with four representing the most serious health concerns, despite the documents indicating that he had aortic stenosis, high blood pressure, and prostate-bladder issues.\n\nSandy Parr, a federal prison staffer who worked on a nursing unit for 15 years, said an 89-year-old inmate with a history of heart problems would \"automatically be a care level three.\" Parr noted that dropping an inmate's care level to a two might have served a specific purpose: making it easier for prison officials to approve his transfer to another penitentiary.\n\n\"It's not uncommon for them to lower a person's care level to get an easy transfer,\" said Parr, who is also the local union president at Federal Medical Center in Minnesota.\n\nWhile the current and former prison staffers interviewed by NBC News don't have direct evidence, they suspect that the real reason for Bulger's transfer lies in his disciplinary history. As NBC News previously reported, Bulger was sanctioned for threatening a nursing supervisor this February, according to prisoner records.\n\n\"Your day of reckoning is coming,\" he allegedly told the worker on Feb. 23, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nSince it was a verbal threat rather than a physical assault, the infraction wasn't severe enough to justify a transfer. But starting on that day, Bulger, then 88, was placed in solitary confinement and kept there for the next eight months.\n\n\"That's a huge red flag,\" said Maraviglia, the prison investigator. \"There was no reason for him to be locked up that long.\"\n\nA Boston Police booking image dated March 16, 1953 of James 'Whitey' Bulger. Boston Police Department via EPA file\n\nSome of the current and former prison staffers said Bulger belonged, if not at Coleman II, at a federal prison hospital.\n\n\u201cThey should have put him in a medical facility and let him live out the rest of his life in a wheelchair,\" said Hood, the former warden and internal affairs chief. \"That didn\u2019t happen and for the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d\n\nIf Bulger was in fact still in good health and needed to be transferred over a disciplinary problem or security risk, the obvious place to send him would have been to the federal prisons in Terre Haute or Tucson, the current and former federal prison staffers said. Like Coleman II, those facilities are also considered \"safe haven\" units for informants and high-profile inmates, the current and former federal prison staffers said.\n\nTucson would have been out of the question, however, because Bulger was placed there in early 2014. He was shipped off to Coleman II that August after being accused of engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a female psychologist, according to the Boston Globe.\n\n\"It appears they were playing hot potato with him,\" said Hood. \"No one wanted Bulger because he's such a high-profile inmate and you know that if anything happens to him, it will get attention around the world.\"\n\nBulger arrived at the Hazelton prison on the night of Oct. 29. The geriatric mobster agreed to be placed in a general population unit, law enforcement sources told NBC News.\n\nBulger was wheeled into his cell just before 10 p.m. At 8:20 a.m., three hours after the cells in his unit were unlocked, he was found murdered.\n\nLaw enforcement sources said inmates assaulted him with a padlock stuffed inside a sock before placing his bloodied body in bed to make it look like he was sleeping.\n\nFor Maraviglia, it wasn't entirely surprising that Bulger would have been asked to be in general population. But the Hazelton higher-ups should have known better than to grant his wish, he said.\n\n\"He may have felt that he was too powerful to be messed with,\" said Maraviglia. \"We see that with major organized crime figures sometimes. But you're an 89-year-old man now. Nobody's scared of you.\"\n\nMaraviglia said if he were handling the case, he would have spelled out his grave concerns, as well as Bulger's wishes, in a letter to the warden and other top brass.\n\n\"I would have said he wanted to go but I don't think he should and this is why,\" said Maraviglia.\n\nThe FBI and the The U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of West Virginia are conducting an investigation into Bulger's killing.\n\nAmong the inmates under suspicion is a former Mafia hitman with a disdain for snitches, according to law enforcement sources and the man's lawyer. But there have been no arrests.\n\nHood said the probe into the murder represents the easy part. Surveillance cameras likely caught the killer or killers entering Bulger's cell.\n\nIt's the investigation that will come after, led by the Justice Department inspector general's office and focused on the federal Bureau of Prison staffers involved in the transfer, that has the potential to shake up the system.\n\n\"The public will soon know which inmates murdered Bulger, but may never understand why the prison system presented the opportunity,\" Hood said. \"The real story will be, how was the ball dropped.\"", "Dignified transfer of Utah mayor, National Guard Major Brent Taylor, at Dover AFB, Delaware. copied!\n\nJennie Taylor spoke as her husband\u2019s remains were flown back to U.S. soil: \u201cThe value of freedom is immeasurable.\u201d\n\nRead More", "By Suzanne Gamboa\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Latinos are heading to the polls Tuesday to cast ballots in a midterm election that in many ways has a lot to do with them.\n\nHealth care and immigration have been front and center in the 2018 midterms and there has been high interest in whether the election would feature a Latino backlash against President Donald Trump.\n\nAlso, the outcome in several races in battleground U.S. House and Senate races, such as in Texas and Nevada, can be influenced by Latino turnout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a more concerted effort at mobilizing Latinos\u201d this election, said Victoria DeFrancesco Soto, a political scientist and lecturer at the Lyndon B.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Reuters\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates unveiled a futuristic toilet Tuesday that doesn't need water or sewers and uses chemicals to turn human waste into fertilizer.\n\nIt is the brainchild of research projects funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's biggest private philanthropy organization. There are multiple designs of the toilet but all work by separating liquid and solid waste.\n\n\"The current toilet simply sends the waste away in the water, whereas these toilets don't have the sewer,\" Gates said. \"They take both the liquids and solids and do chemical work on it, including burning it in most cases.\"\n\nHe compared the change from traditional toilets to waterless models as similar to development in computing around the time he founded Microsoft in the mid-1970s.\n\n\"In the way that a personal computer is sort of self contained, not a gigantic thing, we can do this chemical processing at the household level,\" he said.\n\nPoor sanitation kills half a million children under the age of five annually and costs $200 billion a year in healthcare costs and lost income worldwide, according to the foundation.\n\nGates' foundation has committed roughly $200 million to the toilet project and expects to spend the same amount again before the toilets are viable for widespread distribution.\n\nDuring a speech at an event in Beijing, Gates held up a clear jar of human feces to illustrate the importance of improving sanitation.\n\n\"It's a good reminder that in (the jar) there could be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 20 billion Shigella bacteria, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs,\" he said.\n\nGates said the next step for the project is to pitch the concept to manufacturers, saying he expects the market for the toilets to be over $6 billion by 2030.\n\nThe billionaire also lauded the globalized and free trade systems that made the toilet technology possible.\n\n\"I honestly believe trade allows every country to do what it's best at,\" he told Reuters in an interview. \"So when I talk about components of this toilet being made in China, others in Thailand, others in the United States \u2014 you really want to be bringing together all of that IQ so that you're getting that combination.\"", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Lux Alptraum\n\nFor all the benefits secured by women who deftly wield a makeup brush or wig or shapewear, there\u2019s a danger that comes with being too good at transforming one\u2019s self into the ideal image of female beauty.\n\nIn January 2015, makeup artist Andreigha Wazny posted two photos of her friend Ashley VanPevenage, one showing VanPevenage without makeup, the next showing her with a fully made\u2011up, high-glamour face. The transformation is stark: VanPevenage\u2019s skin goes from blemished to flawless, her nose appears to change shape, her eyebrows darken and fill out, and her eyes \u2014 now framed by dark, smoky eye shadow and lustrous black lashes \u2014 seem brighter and more radiant.\n\nTo anyone familiar with the transformative power of makeup, there was nothing particularly surprising about these before and after shots. But when they went viral, launching out of the orbit of makeup social media and into the mainstream internet, things took a dark turn.\n\nLux Alptraum's \"Faking It: The Lies Women Tell about Sex -\u2014 And the Truths They Reveal\" Courtesy Seal Press\n\nA few weeks after Wazny posted the photos, a Twitter user reposted them with the caption \u201cThe reason why you gotta take a bitch swimming on the first date,\u201d an outing that would presumably wash away a woman\u2019s makeup and reveal her \u201ctrue\u201d face. (The phrase, it should be noted, did not originate with this user, but seemed to explode in popularity subsequent to this exchange.)\n\nThe implication of the phrase, which eventually turned into a meme itself, was clear: Women are trying to deceive men, using the various tricks of the beauty industry to lure unsuspecting paramours into relationships. A man who isn\u2019t careful \u2014 who takes the object of his affection at face value, so to speak \u2014 can easily wind up saddled to a woman who\u2019s merely faking the attractive exterior that drew him to her in the first place. Women, it\u2019s implied, are inherently deceitful, and those who manage to secure through makeup what they were denied by nature deserve to be revealed.\n\nFor women, the world of beauty often presents a difficult, if not outright impossible, situation to navigate. Eschew cosmetics entirely, and you\u2019ll likely be scorned for not caring enough about your appearance; put too much faith in the power of physical transformation, and suddenly you\u2019re a grotesque caricature of vanity as well as a portrait of deceit.\n\nThere is, in theory, an optimal amount of effort that deftly balances looking attractive with not caring too much about your appearance, but where that perfect mix is can be pretty hard to pinpoint \u2014 and where, exactly, it lies depends a lot on what sort of looks you were born with.\n\n\u201cTake a bitch swimming on the first date\u201d may be one of the more vicious male commentaries on female makeup use, but it\u2019s hardly the only one. Men have long declared themselves the arbiters of acceptable application of makeup, and the internet is filled with anti-makeup screeds that use photos to illustrate the argument that women who are unadorned and au naturel look far better than \u201ccakefaces\u201d who bury their skin under layers of product.\n\nWhy the animosity toward makeup? Some of it is undoubtedly due to a suspicion that women who wear makeup are trying to hide something (presumably a hideous appearance), but there\u2019s also a vague sense that women who eschew cosmetics are of an entirely different \u2014 and more desirable \u2014 breed than their bedecked peers. A \"Men\u2019s Health\" piece offering itself up as \u201can ode to natural beauty\u201d presents a collection of reasons why bare faces are better; for readers of \"Men\u2019s Health\" it\u2019s clear that makeup isn\u2019t just makeup.\n\nAccording to the experts cited in the piece, going makeup-free makes women seem more confident, more innocent, and more \u201cprimal\u201d and sexy (how a lack of makeup simultaneously makes women seem less sexually experienced and more \u201cprimal\u201d is a mystery to me), as well as suggesting that they\u2019re outdoorsy, approachable, and down\u2011to\u2011earth. The general sentiment \u2014 which pervades virtually all arguments against makeup \u2014 seems to be that women who eschew beauty culture are more authentic and, as a result, inherently better partners.\n\nWhich, I suppose, makes it that much more ironic that the photos chosen to illustrate this celebration of going makeup-free are all stock images secured from Thinkstock \u2014 photos that, unsurprisingly, are definitely showcasing women who are wearing makeup. This isn\u2019t just a mistake on the part of \"Men\u2019s Health\"; it\u2019s a common trait of articles claiming to celebrate going makeup-free.\n\nIf anything, men who try to use photos to \u201cprove\u201d they hate makeup are more likely to offer up a demonstration of how little they know about how makeup works and what role it plays in many women\u2019s daily routines. The \u201cmakeup-free\u201d women celebrated by men are rarely truly makeup-free; rather, they\u2019re either wearing sparse amounts of carefully applied product or employing the oxymoronic cosmetic strategy known as \u201cnatural makeup.\u201d\n\nFor those not steeped in the lingo of fashion magazines, practitioners of the natural makeup look use cosmetics to create a visage perhaps best described as \u201cyou, but better.\u201d There\u2019s a great deal of emphasis placed on making the skin look flawless; blush, subtle eye shadow, muted lipstick, and mascara all come into play to help make facial features pop and add depth and definition to features that might not stand out without cosmetic assistance. It\u2019s a look that\u2019s supposed to suggest effortless beauty, but as anyone who\u2019s actually put it into practice can tell you, it often takes more effort than a heavier, obviously made\u2011up look.\n\nDevoting the better part of an hour to making yourself look as if you\u2019re not wearing makeup at all may seem like a counterproductive task, but for women with acne scars or eye bags or unwanted facial hair, it can be a way to feel pretty without looking overly made\u2011up. When I ask Baze Mpinja, a former beauty editor for \"Glamour,\" for her thoughts on the look, she offers another possibility for its popularity. Natural makeup, she tells me, allows women to conform to conventional beauty standards without advertising the fact that they\u2019re trying.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to hide the work that goes into looking pretty,\u201d Mpinja notes. \u201cIf you admit how much effort you\u2019re putting in, it begs the question why.\u201d Specifically it suggests that you\u2019re vain or desperate for male attention, undesirable qualities even within a society that teaches women to measure their worth by the amount of attention men give them for their appearances.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear about something: Looking pretty, by American beauty standards, takes a lot of effort \u2014 no matter how genetically gifted you may be. Even if you\u2019re blessed with clear skin and an even complexion, thick, healthy hair, long, dark eyelashes a stunning bone structure and enviably pouty lips, to be considered truly beautiful requires adherence to all manner of painful, time-consuming rituals designed to remake the female body into an artificially soft, smooth, and hairless \u201cideal.\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not white, it\u2019s that much harder: The faces and features most readily celebrated in our culture all hew to a Eurocentric beauty standard.\n\nWhat kind of work goes into being pretty? The first episode of the CW\u2019s \"Crazy Ex\u2011Girlfriend\" offers a glimpse into some of the complicated, and at times grotesque, practices that have been normalized by American beauty culture. As Rachel Bloom performs \u201cThe Sexy Getting Ready Song,\u201d an R & B tribute to the work women put into physically prepping themselves for a romantic encounter, a variety of ablutions are depicted on-screen. Among those that make an appearance are eyebrow plucking, nose hair plucking, heel buffing, donning Spanx, exfoliating facial skin, curling eyelashes, curling hair, bleaching facial hair, and \u2014 in a scene that ends with a shot of blood spattered on the bathroom wall \u2014self-administered waxing of the hair inside her buttocks.\n\nThough the beauty rituals are played for comic effect, they\u2019re very much rooted in reality; indeed, some women\u2019s cosmetic routines are far more punishing than what makes it into the song.\n\nSo much about the ideal women are taught to aspire to \u2014 the gravity-defying yet ample breasts, the silky smooth skin, the muscular yet buxom body \u2014 is an artificial construct, effortlessly available to only a tiny minority of women (if to any of us at all); for the rest of us, achieving the look takes a staggering amount of work. Any woman who\u2019s tried to be pretty knows exactly how much time, effort, and pain are required to adhere to beauty standards.\n\nYet even as we all know what goes on behind the scenes, we\u2019re still playing a perverse little game that asks us to obscure the work, to publicly be in denial about the effort it takes to be an attractive woman. (And, to some degree, to obscure the work it takes to be a woman, period. An essay penned by Jessica Leigh Hester for the Atlantic argues that concealer, foundation and other makeup tricks used to make women look less tired are, in effect, preventing the rest of the world from seeing how tiring it is to live in this world as a woman.)\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to convincingly present a flawlessly attractive exterior; we must do all that while professing to the world that it was all effortless, and that \u2014 to paraphrase Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 we simply woke up this way.\n\nBut to deny the labor that goes into female beauty is to prop up the lie that it\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d to have a body that is anything but, that the aggressive beauty standards we\u2019re judged by are not just acceptable but potentially even fair. When body hair is treated as an invading army to be battled and defeated rather than a simple secondary sex characteristic, the phrase \u201cnatural beauty\u201d ceases to have meaning.\n\nWe\u2019ve bought into the notion that it\u2019s not merely desirable but downright mandatory to invest time and money and effort into maintaining this charade of what \u201creal women\u201d look like \u2014 even as that charade reinforces some of the most noxious aspects of American society.\n\nExcerpted from \"Faking It: The Lies Women Tell about Sex \u2014 And the Truths They Reveal\" by Lux Alptraum.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is of two minds about Tuesday's midterm elections: They could be the end of the world \u2014 or they might not be that big a deal at all.\n\nAs he's criss-crossed the country, barnstorming for Republican candidates and his own 2020 re-election prospects, Trump has told prospective voters that a Democratic takeover of the House would be followed by a breakdown of the economy, open borders, rampant crime, the destruction of Social Security and Medicare, and massive tax hikes.\n\nNone of that is true \u2014 House Democrats won't be able to change any laws at all without the Senate and the president on board \u2014 and even Trump has long suggested that this election isn't as significant as the last one or the next one.\n\n\u201cSo, your vote in 2018 is every bit as important as your vote in 2016 \u2014 although I\u2019m not sure I really believe that,\" he told a conservative crowd this spring. \"But you know ... I don\u2019t know who the hell wrote that line. But it\u2019s still important, remember.\u201d\n\nThat assessment has gotten a bit of an upgrade in the race's final days \u2014 though it is still far short of the shopworn political mantra that each impending election is \"the most important\" ever. \"This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime,\" he said at a rally in Columbia, Missouri, Thursday night.\n\nBut as voters stream to the polls Tuesday, following record numbers who already have availed themselves of early voting in many states, the rest of the political world, including Trump's team, sees this midterm test of his political standing as a potentially cataclysmic political moment.\n\n\"When we say that this midterm is the most important midterm ever, that is not an overstatement,\" Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., said. Voters \"have a choice as to whether or not to vote for hope and a future of equality and living up to American values or they have the alternative choice of voting for fear and division and hate.\"\n\nAt the very least, they will collectively decide whether to apply a foot to the gas or the brake of Trump's turbo-charged bandwagon.\n\nIf Republicans keep control of the House and Senate, Trump will be emboldened to move forward with his policy agenda, which he has said includes new rounds of tax cuts, full funding for his border wall and new limits on legal immigration. And his party will be able to tailor debates in Congress to help his 2020 re-election campaign and divide his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf Democrats win the House \u2014 they need to net a 23-seat gain to do that \u2014 they will have the power to kill his legislative agenda, investigate him and members of his administration, and use the floor to set up fights that they believe are advantageous to their hopes of recapturing the White House.\n\nIf they win the House, \"the smartest thing Democrats could do is break his base by actually trying to play ball on some different bipartisan issues, especially issues that his base won\u2019t like,\" said a former Trump White House official. \"To me, that would be the sharpest strategy.... The stupidest strategy would be to go all in on investigations and try to impeach him and be unwilling to find common ground.\"\n\nBut, the former official added, \"I think it\u2019s going to be complete open warfare and Trump is at his best in complete open warfare.\"\n\nOn Monday, the website FiveThirtyEight put Democrats' chances of winning control of the House at 87.5 percent \u2014 meaning that the site thinks there's a one-in-eight probability of Republicans holding onto their majority. Conversely, with most of the competitive Senate races on the map playing out in heavily Republican states, Republicans have a five-in-six chance of retaining power in that chamber.\n\nThere was a time in American history when divided government produced big, bipartisan deal-making. But in recent decades, presidents have had difficulty negotiating with the House and Senate when they are controlled by the opposite party. President Barack Obama's signature laws \u2014 Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial services regulations \u2014 were both enacted when Democrats controlled both chambers.\n\nIn 2014, after four years of failing to make progress with Republicans in Congress, he rolled out a \"pen\" and \"phone\" strategy designed to use the powers of the executive office to make policy without the legislative branch. Trump has used both an accommodating Republican-controlled Congress and the authority of the executive branch to make policy.\n\nAs Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., noted: \"A Republican majority makes it a lot easier\" for a Republican president to legislate.\n\n\"If the House flips ... basically, the only things you can do are things you can compromise with a Democratic majority,\" he said. \"And that\u2019s going to be hard to do.\"\n\nSome have posited there might be some small room for negotiation between a president and a newly Democratic House. Both sides might have some vested interest in showing the American public that they can govern.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Democrats are willing to work with Trump on three items he's said he's interested in: lowering prescription drug prices, funding infrastructure projects and eliminating corruption in government.\n\n\"On all three issue areas, the president has talked the talk,\" Jeffries said. \"If Democrats are elected in the majority, we are going to try to work with him so that he walks the walk.\"\n\nTrump said Thursday that he'd have to \"work a little bit differently\" if he's dealing with a Democratic House. \"It'll all work out, but I don't think that's going to happen.\"\n\nIn a few hours, the next two years of his presidency will start to come into focus.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Both were vying to be their state's first African-American chief executives.\n\n\"We recognize that we didn't win it tonight,\" Gillum told supporters. Abrams is trailing, though her race remains too close to call.\n\nWith polls now closed in all states, Democrats' hopes for a tidal wave to rebuke President Donald Trump have been tempered by early returns that delivered some surprises in both directions for the out-of-power party.\n\n\"This is not going to be the wave election that people like me hoped for, but it could still be a good election,\" Democratic strategist James Carville said on MSNBC.\n\nIn addition to Texas, Republicans won key Senate contests in Indiana, North Dakota and Tennessee, suggesting the GOP may be on its way to ousting other vulnerable Democratic incumbents in red states, such as Missouri, where Sen. Claire McCaskill was defeated by Republican Josh Hawley, according to an NBC News projection.\n\nStill, the Democrats will find plenty of bright spots after a campaign that often seemed to be playing in two different universes, one for the House, where Trump was a liability for Republicans, and one for the Senate, where he was an asset.\n\nPowered by a suburban revolt against Trump, Democrats flipped more than two dozen congressional seats, a victory sweetened by out-of-the-blue victories in Oklahoma and Staten Island, New York, according to NBC News projections.\n\nDemocratic activists are also likely to cheer the defeat in the Kansas governors race of Republican Kris Kobach, who has a national profile for cracking down on undocumented immigrants and allegations of voting fraud, and the passage of a referendum in Florida to restore voting rights to 1.5 million felons, according to NBC News projections.\n\nGovernor races also presented a mixed decision, with Republicans winning Ohio and Florida, both crucial to Democrats' 2020 plans, while Democrats won in Illinois, Minnesota, Colorado, and several others, and hold narrow leads in too-close-to-call races in Wisconsin and Iowa, two states Trump won.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Ben Popken\n\nAmericans who want to be ready for the next Russian attack can just read an old newspaper.\n\nDuring the Cold War, hundreds of bogus headlines around the world appeared: The U.S. invented AIDS. Wealthy Americans were adopting children to harvest their organs. If these sound like the kind of conspiracies pushed by Russian trolls during the 2016 election, there\u2019s a good reason: They were once promulgated by Russian or Soviet agents.\n\nRussia has a century-old playbook for \u201cdisinformation,\u201d historians and former intelligence officers say, recycling tactics and narratives, and giving clues to detect their next information-warfare attack on our elections.\n\n\u201cI believe in Russia they do have their own manual that essentially prescribes what to do,\u201d said Clint Watts, a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and a former FBI agent.\n\n\u201cThe main difference is the technology available to them,\u201d said Todd Leventhal, a retired senior counter-disinformation officer at the State Department. \u201cThe methodology is the same.\u201d\n\nAnd whether or not you believe the campaign changed a single vote in 2016, \u201cnobody likes to be manipulated,\u201d he said.\n\nPast is prologue\n\nGovernments across the ages have used \u201cdisinformation,\u201d deliberately spreading false stories to deceive, often as part of military feints and maneuvers.\n\n\u201cDisinformation is just lies,\u201d said Kara Swisher, editor of Recode, a tech-news website. \u201cIt's putting out false information to confuse, really, and distract and to make you question real information.\u201d\n\nBut the Soviets under Joseph Stalin elevated \u201cdezinformatsiya\u201d to its own government agency, aggressively spreading lies against their political opponents and misleading citizens with bogus propaganda on a mass scale. The practice in Russia dates at least back to the 1880\u2019s, when it was deployed by the Tsarist secret police, the KGB\u2019s predecessor.\n\n\u201cThe Soviets were notorious... for featuring any kind of tension between races in the United States to suggest that this is a highly discriminatory society,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania communications professor.\n\n\u201cDon't look to the United States as this \u2018shining city sitting on a hill,\u2019\u201d she said, describing the Soviet attitude, \u201cbut actually as this bunch of hypocrites who are pretending they're a shining city sitting on a hill but actually what they have is a facade.\u201d\n\nMethods and sources\n\nA successful disinformation campaign, then and now, requires three elements, said Watts. The first is a state-sponsored news outlet to provide a baseline of communications, such as RT (Russia Today) or Sputnik.\n\nThe second are alternative media sources willing to run stories that fall short of traditional fact-checking standards.\n\nThe third are covert personas and agents of influence who will help advance stories into the media, either as trolls, front organizations and cutouts, or compromised or willing \u201cfellow travelers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat essentially is a spectrum,\u201d said Watts. \u201cIt's from overt, what they're very clearly saying that they support, to covert, that which they plausibly deny to have any involvement with.\u201d\n\nTechniques include forging documents, faking or engineering compromising materials, and undeclared front groups to help advance storylines into the media stream.\n\nA preferred tactic was then to seed a story in a newspaper that was susceptible to Russian influence, because it was run by the KGB, a journalist was paid off, or intermediaries were sympathetic to the Russian cause. Once there, it could take off worldwide.\n\nIn the 80\u2019s the Russians planted a story in an Indian newspaper that the U.S. had invented AIDS, a KGB disinformation campaign known as \"Operation Infektion,\" according to reports, former intelligence officers, and notes taken on the intelligence agency\u2019s documents by a defector and former KGB archivist, Vasili Mitrokhin, reported on by intelligence historian Christopher Andrew in his book, \u201cThe Sword and the Shield.\u201d\n\nIt was later picked up by a Russian magazine and TASS, the Russian state-owned news service.\n\nFrom there it went worldwide, appearing in hundreds of newspapers, and, in 1987, anchor Dan Rather read a news item on it on the CBS Evening News.\n\nThe entire basis was the printing of a purported anonymous letter to the editor of the Indian paper. Later, a doctor with a Russian connection appeared, offering various caveated explanations that suggested details for how the virus may have been created in a U.S. government laboratory, based on some shaky suppositions and using lots of qualifiers.\n\nRussian disinformation agents during the Cold War seeded baseless hoaxes like these in newspapers worldwide to undermine the United States. NBC News\n\nIn the modern era, a bogus story may get its start on 4chan, the extreme message board, or fringe areas of Twitter before being picked up by partisans with more followers and start making its way up the social media and media food chain. In some cases it ends up getting rehashed by Fox News or even making its way in some form to President Trump's tweets and speeches.\n\nIn many cases, the Russians didn\u2019t invent the story but they found one already out there, selectively reframing it to highlight the worst parts and mitigating any qualifying information, and promoting it.\n\nIn 1986, a Honduran adoption official relayed to reporters how his workers were hearing the false local legend of children being adopted to be butchered and used for organ transplant, according to a 1994 State Department report authored by Leventhal. But the Honduran official\u2019s phrasing made it appear as if the story was true and it was reported in local newspapers. He forcefully denied it and issued corrective statements and it disappeared from local press.\n\nMonths later, Soviet newspapers picked it up, stripping out the denial, and repeated it as fact, according to the Mitrokhin archive. Versions of it went on to appear in hundreds of newspapers worldwide, along with new details.\n\nThe hoaxes are almost impossible to eradicate. Versions of the \u201cbaby parts\u201d story, with no ties to Russia, have since spurred mob lynchings in Mexico, India and other places, preceded by false reports circulating virally on WhatsApp and other messaging platforms.\n\nDuring the 2016 election attack campaign by Russia, the same story appeared on a Tumblr page controlled by the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked online disinformation firm.\n\nThe page posted a meme to Tumblr featuring the faces of smiling black children next to a Jet magazine cover story on 800,000 missing black children. \"Look up black organ harvesting,\" the post read. \"Some one or some thing is stealing and consuming our children.\"\n\nIt was the same story from Honduras in the 80\u2019s, recycled by the Russia and given a new twist to stoke modern racial divisions.\n\nKiller lies\n\nDisinformation can also have serious repercussions.\n\nThe \"baby parts\" story led to foreign countries making it harder for American parents to adopt children. In May of 1991, Turkey suspended intercountry adoptions because of the rumor, the State Department reported. In Bulgaria, at one point adoptive parents had to certify they would not allow their adopted children to be an organ donor or be a part of medical experiments, archival adoption papers show.\n\nIt also spurred and several documented physical attacks on American travelers. The AIDS story undercut support for America in target countries, according to a 1987 State Department report, and fueled hysteria during a time when HIV positive patients were dying who could have benefited from clear-headed allocation of funds for research and treatment.\n\n\u201cThe core concept is erosion of trust,\u201d said Renee DiResta, director of research at New Knowledge, an organization that studies disinformation campaigns.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m constantly living in a state of heightened suspicion, that really breaks down relationships between people,\u201d DiResta said. \u201cYou assume that everyone is acting in bad faith and it\u2019s hard to have a conversation. You assume that your media is lying to you then it\u2019s hard to know what to trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you look at where we are as a society today,\u201d she added, \u201cI would argue that they knew what to target very effectively.\u201d\n\nThe other goal, experts say, is to weaken America in a zero-sum game of geopolitics and force the country to accept Russia on its own terms.\n\n\"Russia wants to reach an equilibrium,\" said William Wohlforth a professor of government at Dartmouth College. \"They want to have a dialogue about cyberspace, have us to lay off them, and reach a deal where we accept a moral equivalence between our information space getting into theirs and ours into theirs.\"\n\n\"Most Americans would not want to make that deal that equates authoritarian regimes with democracy,\" he said.\n\nAmerica's technologies, free speech, privacy protections and regulatory approach have made attacking that democracy easier than ever.\n\n\"Twenty years ago the Russians had to recruit journalists to find people to disseminate something,\" said John Schindler, a former NSA analyst.\n\n\"Nowadays they just have to start a meme.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It has previously said DiGaudio \"was simply trying to get to the truth\" and wasn't trying to influence the investigation.\n\nThree of the five remaining criminal charges against Weinstein stem from allegations that he raped a woman in a hotel room in March 2013. They are also tainted by allegations that DiGaudio behaved improperly. The two other charges allege that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on the woman in 2006 at his apartment in Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors last month dropped a sixth charge, alleging that Weinstein forced Lucia Evans to perform oral sex in 2004 when she was a college student and a fledgling actress, after evidence surfaced that DiGaudio told her friend to keep quiet when she raised doubts about the veracity of the allegations.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in a letter to Benjamin Brafman, an attorney for Weinstein, that was unsealed on Oct. 11 that DiGaudio had advised the witness that \"less is more.\"\n\nDays later, Illuzzi-Orbon disclosed an allegation that DiGaudio urged Weinstein's 2013 rape accuser to delete material from her cellphones before handing them over to prosecutors. She said that the material didn't pertain to Weinstein and that the woman wound up not deleting anything.\n\nWeinstein, 66, denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\nHis attorneys, in their filing on Monday, also again knocked prosecutors for failing to show the grand jury that indicted him evidence that they contend undermined the remaining allegations.\n\nRepeating an earlier argument, Weinstein's attorneys cited warm emails that they said the 2013 accuser sent after the date of the alleged attack in which she welcomed plans to get together with Weinstein, sought advice and told him that no one \"understands me quite like you.\"\n\nIn a new revelation, Weinstein's attorneys said the 2006 accuser had also been in contact with him after the date on which she later told authorities that she was assaulted. That accuser sent a text message about seven months later seeking to meet with Weinstein, the lawyers said.\n\nThe accusers \"had the temerity to reach out to [Weinstein] and try to engage him in social relationships \u2014 'after' they now claim he viciously sexually assaulted them,\" the lawyers wrote. \"The sheer hypocrisy of the indictment is simply stunning.\"\n\nGloria Allred, an attorney for the 2006 accuser, said by email that the filing was \"replete with unjustified speculation\" that is \"completely contradicted by the facts.\"\n\n\"If they are engaging in speculation as to my client, I believe that they are lacking in facts which would exculpate their client Mr. Weinstein,\" Allred said. \"Their defense of Mr. Weinstein as to my client appears to be built on quicksand rather than on a strong factual foundation.\"\n\nAfter Allred's client, a former film production assistant, went public with her allegations, she said she wanted to maintain her privacy and preferred that her name not be used.\n\nIn another wrinkle, Weinstein's attorneys argued that by dropping the Evans-related charge, prosecutors washed away the legal foundation for another charge, predatory sexual assault, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction.", "Viral video shows mighty bear cub aiming to reach parent atop snowy mountain copied!\n\nIn a captivating video, a bear and its cub are seen making their way up a snowy mountain.

Nelson, author and journalist\n\nJust hours before the 2018 midterm elections, my mind is focused on the 11 Jewish brothers and sisters who were murdered at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27. It was a horrific tragedy, and one that reinforces just how far the U.S. has strayed from our core values. And so as Americans across the country get ready to head to the polls on Tuesday, I think it is time for those of us who call ourselves Christians to stand up. And most importantly, to speak up against the hate being spewed by the president of the United States, a man who was wholeheartedly endorsed by white evangelical Christians in 2016.\n\nThe disturbing reality is that many of the people enthusiastically engaging in divisive rhetoric right now are people who also call themselves followers of Christ. This rhetoric is often cloaked in a desire to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d or to \u201cprotect Christian values\u201d or \u201cChristian heritage.\u201d But all of these are code words, sadly, for protecting whiteness in America. And an honest review of the \u201cChristians\u201d espousing such division, or worse justifying it, are almost all white, male and over 40. They invariably fear that, like Justice Brett Kavanaugh, their sons are under attack from radical feminists, leftists, dangerous immigrants and people of color.\n\nFact: In 2016, white evangelicals (some 81 percent, according to Pew) lined up squarely behind President Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign. That support has not changed much in the past two years, with leaders like Franklin Graham and Jerry Falwell, Jr., defending Trump and attacking those who speak out against him.\n\nThese evangelical leaders were equally vocal during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, showing no empathy or compassion for the woman who testified that she had been sexually assaulted by the judge as a teenager. As a Christian woman, I have watched Trump's increasingly cruel attacks on migrant families with disgust. He suggested that soldiers deployed to the border would be authorized to shoot children throwing rocks. My social media feed now sickens me, as I watch so-called Christians defend the indefensible.\n\nThrough it all, established white female evangelicals have been largely silent, with some exceptions. Beth Moore, a bold Texan with a loyal following of millions of Christian women across the globe, has been unafraid to challenge the evangelical church's good ol' boys' club. Other powerful women like Joyce Meyers, Lisa Bevere, Sheilah Walsh and Christine Caine have been less outspoken.\n\nThe younger generation gives me hope, however. I was heartened by reports that some white, female Christian voters in Texas, the bastion of white Christian evangelical power, are now supporting Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u201cWhen I look at [Ted] Cruz, I think he sees Republican politics. When I look at Beto, I think he sees vulnerable people who need to be supported,\u201d one woman told The New York Times\u2019 Elizabeth Dias.\n\nIt\u2019s great that this segment of the church community is pushing back. But middle-aged white men are still the power brokers in southern Baptist and evangelical movements. They hold the power and they preach in the pulpits (as is the case in the black church). And, just as importantly, the women who are married to these men and who fill their churches sit quietly in their pews.\n\nWhat modern day evangelicals like Falwell and others have done is to legitimize the white, male patriarchy as the status quo.\n\nThis dynamic makes no sense to me as a lifelong Christian, someone who believes that you cannot say you love Jesus but hate his people. You cannot say you love America, but not love your fellow Americans. What modern day evangelicals like Falwell and others have done is legitimize the patriarchy as the status quo: In this system, white men can break the rules, they can cheat, lie, evade taxes, have affairs and still be deemed God\u2019s chosen one.\n\nThat\u2019s bogus. And it\u2019s not at all what these same Christian leaders said about President Barack Obama, who was a devoted family man and who attended church services every week.\n\nTrump knows this. That\u2019s why he feels so comfortable railing against refugees and black football players, or openly aligning himself with a Congressman who assaulted a reporter. Trump knows that these attacks will resonate with his base; he also knows that Christian leaders will not condemn them. They are complicit in his chorus of hate, willfully ignoring Christ\u2019s core admonitions to \u201clove thy neighbor as thyself\u201d and to \u201cfeed the poor, care for the sick and least among you.\u201d\n\nThis hypocrisy mirrors the hypocrisy of many colonial Christians in the 17th and 18th centuries. These men and women originally called themselves puritans, but their children and grandchildren would build a nation on the backs of slaves. Despite a national creed that spoke of equality and freedom, men were the masters of this burgeoning universe. And we can still see vestiges of this philosophy in the evangelical movement today.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the bottom line? Polls leading up to election day this past week show a gender gap in favor of the Democrats. It looks like educated and independent white women, some of whom who doubtlessly voted for Republicans in 2016, may be turning back towards the Democrats. I believe this phenomenon has little to do with economics, or healthcare \u2014 it has to do with women being sick and tired of men like Trump.\n\nNot all evangelical Christians are alike, and luckily it seems like younger women in particular are starting to see the light. Candidates like Beto O\u2019Rourke, politicians who sincerely try to follow the teachings of Jesus, may be able to appeal to these conservatives. And if they can do this, we may be witnessing the beginning of an important demographic shift. Older, white evangelicals are living in the past. If conservative Christians can\u2019t figure out a way to return to their biblical roots, their time at the top may be coming to an end \u2014 and with it the candidates they have unquestioningly supported.", "Georgia GOP candidate asks FBI to investigate Democrats for hacking voter database copied!\n\nRepublican nominee Brian Kemp has offered no evidence publicly to back up the hacking allegations against the Democrats, and has rejected calls he should resign from his post as Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State.\n\nRead More", "Women hold massive power on ballot and in voting booth in this year\u2019s midterms copied!\n\nArizona\u2019s Senate race could help determine who controls the Senate and Washington, and no matter who wins, the state will make history by electing its first female senator in its 106 year history.\n\nRead More", "Democrats\u2019 closing message: Health Care, Not Impeachment copied!\n\nThe stakes are huge for Democrats: if they win the House, they gain control of committees and subpoena power, enabling them to investigate President Trump.\n\nRead More", "NBC, Fox News pull Trump immigration ad copied!\n\nThe ad tries to link a mexican immigrant convicted of murder four years ago to the current group of Central American migrants.

Two years ago, the company did little to police misinformation and allowed a Russian influence campaign and politically motivated trolls to thrive.\n\nA screenshot from a private chat in which a social media troll described getting blocked by Twitter from spreading misinformation\n\nBut the trolls are also learning from their mistakes and developing new strategies to sidestep Twitter\u2019s rules \u2014 sometimes with new technology available on other apps \u2014 highlighting the arms race between these groups and social media companies that are developing systems to stop them.\n\nWhile much of its focus has been on foreign operations, Twitter has ramped up preventative measures against domestic troll networks that organize in private chats to push coordinated disinformation on their platform. On Friday, Twitter revealed it took down 10,000 accounts that discouraged voting, mostly accounts posing as Democrats.\n\nNBC News saw some of those accounts in action when an NBC reporter was mistakenly invited to private chats on Twitter and in the gaming chat room service Discord, where some of those talking points and strategies for spreading disinformation were workshopped in the last month.\n\nMany of those strategies, including encouraging Democrats to vote one day after election day, were stopped by an algorithm before they reached users on Twitter.\n\nA spokesperson for Twitter pointed NBC News to a series of company blog posts from last month describing updates about rules surrounding fake accounts on Twitter, including plans to ban the \u201cuse of stock or stolen avatar photos\u201d and the \u201cuse of intentionally misleading profile information.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs platform manipulation tactics continue to evolve, we are updating and expanding our rules to better reflect how we identify fake accounts, and what types of inauthentic activity violate our guidelines,\u201d Del Harvey, vice president for trust and safety at Twitter, and Yoel Roth, head of site integrity, wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe now may remove fake accounts engaged in a variety of emergent, malicious behaviors.\u201d\n\nNina Jankowicz, a global fellow who specializes in disinformation at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, a research center that studies Russia, called Twitter\u2019s automated troll enforcement \u201cthe type of proactive behavior we need to see more of\u201d from social media companies.\n\n\u201cParticularly, it\u2019s interesting to see they\u2019re looking to see efforts around voter suppression \u2014 something we\u2019ve seen a lot in the past on social media platforms before election day,\u201d Jankowicz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good use of [artificial intelligence], and I wish Facebook would do more about it.\u201d\n\nBoth Twitter and Facebook have devoted \u201cwar rooms\u201d to fighting back against election-related disinformation and false conspiracy theories in the run-up to the 2018 midterms. Facebook has publicly struggled with the problem in the last week, as multiple reports have surfaced of viral troll accounts spreading conspiracy theories and false or racist memes.\n\nMany of those memes are created or weaponized in small groups then pushed on Facebook pages or public Twitter accounts to achieve maximum virality.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where disinformation is thriving now, where there\u2019s no content moderation and no ability to search or see what\u2019s trending,\u201d Jankowicz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real problem.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, Twitter\u2019s algorithm could not catch up with persistent trolls working together in private chats. NBC News witnessed trolls developing new strategies on the fly to circumvent the bans. Several were successful in creating unique identities that appeared to be middle-aged women who posted anti-Trump rhetoric as part of a long-term effort to build up followings that could later be used to seed disinformation to hundreds or thousands of followers.\n\nOne troll who stole a woman\u2019s identity came up with a plan to skirt reverse image search programs that would show users the real identity of the woman in its stolen profile picture.\n\n\u201cIf you want a Twitter pic that is a completely unique photo and not an actual person, use the Snapchat filter where you can layer another face,\u201d said one user. \u201cIt will be a completely unique face.\u201d\n\nA screenshot from a private chat room in which social media trolls discuss how to get around Twitter's security.\n\nOther users passed around tutorials, mostly screenshots from the fringe internet message board 4chan, showing techniques that allowed them to evade bans on Twitter and Facebook.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., whom alt-right trolls referred to as \u201cSpartacus,\u201d with a disinformation campaign last month.\n\nSome of the trolls' coordinated campaigns remain on Twitter under the hashtags \"#nomenmidterm\" and \"#letwomendecide,\" where users posing as Democrats implore liberal men not to vote.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Pete Williams\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to take up the legal battle over the future of DACA quickly, asking the justices to consider the issue even before a federal appeals court has ruled on the program's legality.\n\nIf the justices don't act soon, the Justice Department said, it will probably be too late to get the case on this year's docket. In that event, the government would likely be required to keep the program going at least another year.\n\nShort for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA allows children of illegal immigrants to remain here if they were under 16 when their parents brought them to the U.S. and if they arrived by 2007. The Obama-era initiative has allowed 700,000 young people, known as Dreamers, to avoid deportation.\n\nThe Trump administration moved to end the program a year ago, but federal courts have blocked that attempt. Following a brief hiatus, the government began accepting renewal applications from DACA participants, which must be filed every two years. But the Trump administration is hoping to overturn the rulings that said DACA must be allowed to continue.\n\nA federal court in San Francisco was the first to say that the government acted illegally in trying to shut it down. The government appealed that ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral argument May 15. In mid-October, the Justice Department notified the appeals court that if it did not rule on the dispute by the end of October, the government would ask the Supreme Court to take up the case anyway.\n\nThe Trump administration tried earlier this year to get the case before the Supreme Court while it was pending in the 9th Circuit. The justices declined that invitation in late February but said they assumed the appeals court would \"proceed expeditiously to decide this case.\"\n\nBut in a legal brief filed in the Supreme Court late Monday, Solicitor General Noel Francisco said, \"That has not happened.\"\n\nThe court should take the case away from the 9th Circuit and decide it now, Francisco said. \"Absent prompt intervention from this court, there is little chance the court would resolve this dispute for at least another year.\"\n\nSupporters of DACA have been largely successful in their legal fight to keep the program going. Courts in Washington and New York have also blocked the government from shutting it down. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to take up those cases now, too, on the fast track.\n\nIt normally takes at least two months to get a case to the Supreme Court, ready for the justices to consider whether to hear the appeal. But by mid-January, the court typically has filled up the argument calendar for the term, which ends in late June. So if the California appeals court doesn't rule on the DACA issue soon, there would be little chance of getting the case on the Supreme Court's docket in the current term.\n\nThe Supreme Court rarely agrees to hear cases before the appeals courts have ruled. But the government's chances might be better this time, given that the justices said they expected the appeals court to act more quickly than it usually does. The 9th Circuit takes an average of nearly 23 months to issue a final ruling, and only about six months have elapsed since the DACA case was argued. A ruling by the end of the year might be considered expeditious.\n\nCivil rights advocates condemned the Justice Department's action.\n\n\"It is clear that Trump will stop at nothing to get what he and extremists have wanted all along \u2014 to deport as many people in our communities, including Dreamers, as possible. And to do it as quickly as possible,\" said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, of the NILC Immigrant Justice Fund, an immigrant rights group.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

This attention was not unwarranted: In 2016, a coalition of Russian organizations, from private troll farms to uniformed intelligence officers of the Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, waged a three-pronged attack against our democracy. This included pushing divisive narratives on social media, hacking and releasing private emails to manipulate the media and forays into hacking our election infrastructure.\n\nWhile Russian campaigns have continued to operate since 2016, a collaboration between government agencies, tech companies and independent research groups have done much to roll back the disinformation networks Russian actors built over years. In this cycle we have yet to see the activity you would expect if these networks were fully rebuilt, and the relative quiet going into the midterms has many observers asking: \u201cWhere are the Russians?\u201d\n\nThe relative quiet going into the midterms has many observers asking: \u201cWhere are the Russians?\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of interpretations for this silence. The first possibility is that most of Russia\u2019s information warfare assets are sitting the 2018 midterms out. There are several reasons why this would make sense: With 435 House, 35 Senate and 36 gubernatorial races on the ballot Tuesday, the ability to shape an overall outcome beneficial to Russia\u2019s geostrategic interests is limited. Building disinformation capabilities takes an investment of time and resources, and it would be reasonable to reserve most of those resources for what promises to be a contentious Democratic primary (which unofficially starts Wednesday) and a divisive 2020 election.\n\nThe second possibility is that Russian interference will be more subtle and deniable this time around. There was a certain air of impunity to Russia\u2019s 2016 activity, with both government and non-governmental actors often operating without sufficiently covering their tracks. This is not wholly unlike the successful and attempted assassinations that have been traced back to Russian agents, a link made obvious by the use of exotic nerve agents and radioactive materials and the obvious parading of intelligence assets on state TV. This time around, the oligarchs and intelligence officers behind these groups could very well have decided to pursue the same goals in a much less blatant fashion.\n\nAn overarching theme of Russia\u2019s efforts has emphasizing the risks of free and fair elections, at least compared to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s brand of rigged democracy.\n\nIf so, what goal could they have? An overarching theme of Russia\u2019s efforts has emphasizing the risks of free and fair elections, at least compared to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s brand of rigged democracy. Even in a highly distributed election such as the midterms, attacking the certainty Americans have in our democratic processes is still possible.\n\nAs a country, we have already created ripe conditions for casting doubt on our democratic legitimacy. Many states continue to use insecure electronic voting machines, and five states use systems with no paper trails at all. Building on their exploratory attacks in 2016, it would not necessarily be difficult for Russian attackers to crash or demonstrate control of Internet-connected systems in the 10,000 local election authorities. Most of these attacks would not be able to influence the final vote totals, but the propaganda value would still be great.\n\nAnother option for foreign groups would be to create the impression of continued Russian influence. Anybody can create a handful of fake social media accounts to push aggressive memes or misleading stories; the goal of the social media platforms should be to reduce the spread and influence of these accounts before they create large followings. We should be wary of anybody who claims the existence of a vast network of influential accounts without hard evidence, and we should be especially wary of any claims that specific candidates were assisted by said network.\n\nThere are some hints that this tactic might already be in the works. Last week, a known member of the Russian trolling ecosystem who goes by \u201cWilliam\u201d posted a video claiming that he is now a whistleblower and in fear for his life. In the video, which is shot in what looks like a small apartment with carefully arranged Russian-language product labels, William shows off a purported internal document that instructs trolls to support prominent candidates like Texas senate hopeful Beto O\u2019Rouke. The video sets up the argument that any surprise win by O\u2019Rouke was achieved with Russian help. There is no need to do the hard work of actually building and operating a disinfo network if one can convince the American people it exists and was effective in changing election outcomes.\n\nWhat should we do about any attempts to make these claims? First off, we need to resist the temptation to grant credence to unsupported theories that happen to correspond with our prior beliefs. Unlike in 2016, the major tech platforms and several federal agencies have dedicated election security teams monitoring and investigating any attempts to hack election systems or influence our national discourse. We should, of course, feel free to discuss allegations of vote tampering or influence operations, but we need to be cautious and skeptical about any attempts to imply that our democratic system is rigged.\n\nIn the end, the ability to defeat this enemy lies not with any government agency or Silicon Valley giant, but with our citizenry. We can choose to not be manipulated. As with all bullies, Russia\u2019s greatest fear is not being defeated, but being ignored.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

One, I\u2019d never covered President Barack Obama on the trail before. In fact, I\u2019d never been to a campaign rally without Donald Trump. And two, I spent 510 days covering Donald Trump on the trail in 2015 and 2016, but hadn\u2019t been to one of his rallies since the transition.\n\nObama in Atlanta\n\nFirst up was Obama. On Friday, he stumped for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at Morehouse College in Atlanta, a historically black liberal arts institution. It was packed, a sold-out crowd of 6,000 that didn't look like any other crowd I had seen at a political event before. The room was almost entirely African-American \u2014 the exact opposite of Trump\u2019s crowds. But the differences were more than skin deep.\n\nNearly everything about this rally was new to me. The mood, the message, the attitude, the stagecraft, even the clothes the supporters wore were different. Up until Friday, every rally I\u2019d been to looked more like a pageant of red, white and blue, festooned with American flag scarfs, eagles on shirts, patriotic sequins, and the deeper we got into 2016, MAGA Hats, \"Lock Her Up\" tees, and Donald Trump\u2019s face anywhere you could fit it.\n\nObama supporters came in everyday street clothes. A few had \"Hope and Change\" on their chests. One woman wore a \"Still My President\" T-shirt and some wore \"Abrams for Governor\" gear. Almost none had signs and most kept their support to a sticker or a pin.\n\nAnd they were happy to speak to reporters, happy to share their views and argue for their candidate.\n\nThey talked about healthcare, the economy, and finding someone who will represent them. They worried about a political divide that looks like an unbridgeable chasm and a sitting president who they say is only making things worse. Some of them had waited in line all night to hear Obama speak.\n\nJavien Moore, an 18-year-old student at Morehouse who showed up in a matching maroon college sweatsuit, told me that he and his friend Charles came out to see Obama because they wanted to feel inspired again.\n\n\u201cThe morals of our country need to be rekindled,\u201d Moore told me matter of factly. Both young men say they voted for the first time this year \u2014 and they voted early.\n\n\u201cI feel like no matter who's going to be in charge there's going to be an issue with them,\u201d Charles said. \u201cBut I feel like having the right people in the right place will do us better as a community rather than tear us apart.\u201d\n\nOutside, in front of an oversize hand-painted portrait of Obama, Cheryl Scales counted all the reasons she was supporting Abrams: \u201cShe's qualified. She's talented. She's inclusive. She has incredible policies.\u201d Scales, who owns a construction development firm and hands out business cards with her portrait on the front, didn\u2019t get into specifics but said race and gender were absolutely a factor in her decision.\n\n\u201cSelfishly? I'm a black woman. I want to see the first black governor who is a female in this country.\u201d She said there was nothing she liked about Abrams' GOP opponent, Brian Kemp.\n\nBack inside, Obama came into the gym from a side door and bounded up a small flight of stairs to the stage. At Trump rallies, the screams of the crowd could drown out a jet plane. Obama\u2019s supporters screamed too but it sounded different \u2014 an unbridled joy that I can only compare to what I\u2019ve seen on old newsreels during Beatlemania, which is probably why both John McCain and Mitt Romney portrayed him as a pop star.\n\nOn stage, his voice raspy from recent campaigning, Obama talked about health care, reminding the crowd that the Republicans have voted multiple times to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\"So now it's election season and suddenly, magically, Republicans are out there running ads saying we're going to protect you if you've got pre-existing conditions,\" Obama said as a man in the crowd chanted \u201clies, lies, lies.\u201d\n\nHe accused Kemp of trying to \u201cdisenfranchise people\u201d and told folks the \u201ccharacter of our country is on the ballot.\u201d\n\nAt one point, with a less-than-perfect sound system and Obama\u2019s voice growing increasingly hoarse, the crowd shushed itself to try and hear him better. Obama leaned into the microphone. Unlike Trump had done at times in 2016, Obama didn\u2019t yell at his advance man or declare that he wouldn\u2019t pay the sound guy.\n\nBut more than anything else, Obama had one real message for the evening: Vote, vote, vote.\n\n\u201cWhen words stop meaning anything, when people can just make stuff up and there\u2019s no consequences, democracy can\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only guardian of truth is you. You and your vote.\"\n\nTrump in Macon\n\nOn Sunday, I was 90 miles away in Macon to see Trump campaign for Brian Kemp, Georgia's Secretary of State.\n\nIt was my first Trump rally in two years but nothing had changed \u2014 the same adoring crowds, same MAGA gear and same \u201cWomen For Trump\u201d signs. There were socks stamped with Trump\u2019s face and shirts emblazoned with some new slogans, including: \u201cTRUMP 2020 the Sequel: Make the Liberals Cry Again.\u201d\n\nOne of the more creative T-shirts, if a bit muddled in its message, said \u201cKeg Stand Kavanaugh,\u201d featuring an image of the newest Supreme Court justice\u2019s face surrounded by red, white and blue beer kegs.\n\nMax Colvin told me his number-one issue was the economy and jobs. \u201cI think the president has done a terrific job and even though I\u2019m still unemployed that\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. Colvin, who said he used to read the weather on a local radio station in Macon, thinks the president just needs more time to help him find a job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even been two years yet,\" he said. \"All the signs are pointing to a better economy every day and more jobs. Everyone is saying we\u2019re going to have inflation but if you have a job and you\u2019re making good money do you care what a loaf of bread costs?\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s honesty didn\u2019t matter. No one batted at an eye when I asked them about Trump\u2019s difficulty with the truth, instead arguing that \u201che tries his best.\u201d Some parroted him by blaming the media. No one I spoke with at the airport tarmac rally trusted a mainstream outlet beyond Fox News. More than a few people wore INFOWARS shirts.\n\n\u201cNot CNN. I don\u2019t want to say Facebook but I do read a lot of statistics,\u201d explained Phil Slowther, who was wearing socks decorated with cartoons of Trump\u2019s face. Asked where he gets his statistics, Slowther told me they come from \u201clittle side organizations.\u201d He says he decides what to trust by using his common sense and praying on it.\n\nMeredith Koehler was wearing a red MAGA hat, dark sunglasses, and a chunky rhinestone necklace.

Only this time, the plane wasn\u2019t the black one with his name on it in big gold block letters, as it was two years ago. It was blue and white with The United States of America in an understated Caslon typeface. I\u2019ll admit that was a first for me. I\u2019d never seen Air Force One in person. Most of the folks around me hadn\u2019t either. They were understandably awed.\n\nAs Trump took the stage slowly clapping and soaking in the affirmation, the crowd let out an earsplitting cheer that sounded like one long guttural roar. \u201cWe won\u2019t go back,\u201d they chanted, followed later by \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump\u201d and \u201cwin, win, win.\u201d\n\nIt took less than five minutes before the president mentioned Hillary Clinton. The crowd bit and launched into a resounding rendition of \u201clock her up.\u201d A little later on they repurposed it for a Kavanaugh accuser, who Trump said totally recanted her story.\n\nHe told attendees that Democrats want to eliminate borders, they want to let in criminals who will hurt their family, and would allow \u201cillegals\u201d to vote. And, he said, Democrats want to take away their guns.\n\nHe called Abrams \u201cone of the most extreme, far-left politicians in the entire country\u201d and warned Georgians she wants to turn their state into Venezuela. Unlike Obama, who kept bringing his message back to Abrams, the candidate he was there support, Trump only mentioned Kemp sparingly. In Macon, he made it clear who the headliner was.\n\nIn all, the weekend could be summed up in two simple appeals to the base.

Mosman issued a preliminary injunction on Friday that stops the Bureau of Land Management from moving forward with its plan to surgically remove the ovaries of wild mares in the Warm Springs Management Area of Hines, Oregon, according to court records.\n\n\u201cWe thank the court for preventing the BLM from proceeding with a reckless and inhumane surgical sterilization experiment that would endanger the welfare and lives of federally protected wild horses,\u201d Joanna Grossman, equine program manager for the Animal Welfare Institute, said in a statement.\n\n\"Today\u2019s ruling is a decisive victory for animal welfare and for the American people, who not only cherish wild horses but have a First Amendment right to understand how the federal government is treating and managing these herds on public lands,\" Grossman added.\n\nThe judge's decision means the agency cannot proceed with the experiment until a final decision is made in the case. No date has been set for that yet.\n\nSign up for Breaking News Alerts from NBC News\n\nThe Animal Welfare Institute, American Wild Horse Campaign, The Cloud Foundation and other animal welfare groups had sued in September, claiming the government project was in violation of the First Amendment for not letting groups observe and document the experiment while also being in violation of a number of laws including the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act, National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nA Bureau of Land Management spokesperson said Tuesday that they cannot comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe bureau has struggled with managing herd populations and in 2016 issued a report to Congress saying since receiving federal protection in 1971, \u201cwild horse and burro populations on public lands have dramatically increased, far exceeding what is healthy for the land and the animals.\u201d\n\nIn June, the bureau put forward a proposal aimed at herd size management, saying it was seeking to evaluate the safety, complication rate and feasibility of using the sterilization surgery, called an ovariectmony via colpotomy, on wild horse mares in conjunction with Colorado State University.The experiment was looking to assess the impacts of the procedure on those horses and their behavior compared to horses without the surgery.\n\nThe study would look at 200 horses from the Warm Springs Herd Management Area, in southeastern Oregon, with 100 horses receiving the procedures and 100 serving as a control for the experiment, according to the proposal.\n\nIn August, following a public comment period, CSU withdrew from the project, but the bureau decided to move forward with its plan anyway, according to the bureau\u2019s website. The bureau issued its final assessment on the proposal in September.\n\nGrossman told NBC News on Monday that the decision to \u201cmove forward regardless without an academic institution to provide expertise on equine welfare\u201d greatly raised concerns for animal rights groups.\n\nWith the university out of the picture, the bureau was going to greatly restrict \u201cpublic access to monitor, observe and document the mares as they were going through this procedure,\u201d she added.\n\nThe animal welfare groups then decided to file suit claiming the experiment violates their First Amendment rights as well as the environmental laws, Grossman said.\n\nThe surgical procedure involves a veterinarian removing both of a mare's ovaries by making an incision and putting their hand inside the horse\u2019s abdominal cavity and \u201clooking for the ovaries blindly\u201d and then severing them using a tool, she said.\n\nThat surgery can result in complications, trauma and even death for the mares especially once they\u2019re returned to the wild and not having follow up treatment, she said.\n\nThe animal welfare group believes such a procedure is \u201cwidely viewed as being out of date\u201d and inhumane and that there are other methods that can help successfully control populations without being so invasive, she said.\n\nGrossman added that the surgical procedure \u201cwas not common at all\u201d for wild mares and in domesticated horses would usually only be performed if the mare needed it for medical reasons, such as to remove a malignant growth.\n\nGrossman said she and other animal rights groups have been advocating for immunocontraceptive vaccines or pellets that prevent the horses from being fertile as more humane.\n\n\"It\u2019s a far more humane way of managing wild horse populations that doesn\u2019t involve a risky invasive surgery that puts the lives of these animals on the line,\" she said.", "By Saleah Blancaflor\n\nElection Day could be history-making for Asian Americans, with the chance to elect the first Korean-American person to Congress in 20 years, and the first Korean-American woman and the first Filipino-American woman ever to Congress.\n\nAsian-American voters can also make a difference in numerous races: While the group makes up 4.1 percent of voting-age citizens in the U.S., they are the fastest growing racial group in the country, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nResearchers expect the voting bloc to double by 2040, and Asian-American voters could end up swinging 27 congressional races this year, according to AAPI Data, a research program at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nThough the 2018 Asian American Voter Survey, published in October, found that many Asian Americans were not contacted by political parties, it also found that voter enthusiasm was up compared to the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nAhead of Election Day, NBC Asian America profiled a number of Asian-American candidates running for office and looked at trends among Asian-American voters:\n\nDespite making up about 1 percent of the U.S. population, only one person of Filipino descent is currently a member of Congress.\n\nGina Ortiz Jones, the Democratic nominee for a House seat in West Texas in San Antonio, Texas, on Aug. 10, 2018.

Timm\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke at length about health care during his weekend blitz of rallies before the midterm elections on Tuesday, pitching Republicans as leaders and defenders on health care and Democrats as avowed socialists who want to cannibalize Medicare.\n\n\"We're doing a good job,\" Trump said while touting his party's leadership on the issue on Sunday night.\n\nWhat has Trump claimed, and what are the facts?\n\nClaim: Average premiums\n\n\"Average premiums in Georgia this year are coming down, we\u2019re bringing them down,\" Trump said on Sunday in Macon, Georgia. \"We\u2019re running it properly.\"\n\nExperts believe Obamacare premiums are dropping or only rising slightly because the exchanges are stabilizing after two years of sharp rate increases \u2014 not because Trump somehow quietly fixed the program while trying to repeal it.\n\nAnd some experts argue premiums would have dropped far more if Trump hadn\u2019t tried to undercut the law by spending most of the year trying to repeal it and eventually destabilizing it by eliminating the individual mandate that helped force healthy people into the marketplace.\n\nClaim: Better, cheaper health care plans\n\n\"We've just introduced new affordable health care plans for Georgia, new individual markets that only cost about half the price of Obamacare, and it\u2019s frankly better insurance,\" he said in Georgia.\n\nTrump appears to be describing the barebones insurance plans his administration has championed after loosening the Obamacare restrictions on such cheaper plans. Obamacare largely eliminated those plans because the coverage was so limited, and only allowed them to be sold as brief stopgaps for those in transition after changing jobs, for instance.\n\nCritics call these \"junk\" insurance plans and note the benefits are not equivalent, let alone better, than the more expensive, but more comprehensive plans offered through Obamacare. Democrats introduced legislation to overturn the Trump regulation that allowed these plans, forcing a Senate vote that failed along party lines.\n\n\u201cThese plans are cheap for a reason,\u201d Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., said last month. \u201cThey do not have to provide essential health benefits like hospitalization, prescription drugs and maternity care.\u201d\n\nClaim: Access to private care for veterans\n\n\"We passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor rather than waiting on line for 10 days, for 20 days, for 3 months,\" Trump said in Georgia.\n\nThe Veterans Choice Program was created in 2014 \u2014 years before Trump took office. It allowed veterans who did not live within 40 miles of a department hospital or faced wait times of over a month to seek private care.\n\nTrump signed a law that reformed and consolidated that program and others into something called the Veterans Community Care Program, expanding the circumstances under which a veteran can get private medical care. His reforms will not be enacted until 2019, and wait times may still be a problem. The national average wait time to see a private doctor under the program now is 51 days, the Government Accountability Office reported in June.\n\nClaim: The Democratic Party will 'obliterate' Medicare, hurting seniors\n\n\"The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 360,000 Indiana seniors who totally depend on it,\u201d Trump said in Indianapolis.\n\nWhile some Democrats support moving toward a single-payer health care system, the party does not agree on it: Medicare for All legislation introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has support from less than half of all Democratic senators.\n\nThough the Sanders plan is short on revenue details, Democrats are proposing to insure more people with a system built from the foundation of Medicare, not kick a bunch of senior citizens off their plans. For instance, the legislation proposes phasing out Medicare Advantage plans \u2014 the Medicare plans administered by private companies \u2014 and phasing in plans with similar benefits and stronger financial protections, too.\n\nClaim: Republicans will protect Medicare\n\n\"Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors \u2014 who earned it and frankly, have paid for it,\" Trump said in Indianapolis.\n\nTrump has long vowed to protect Medicare in rallies like this one, but his administration's budget proposals and his party don\u2019t always agree with him. The Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voiced support for cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security in an interview last month, and Trump\u2019s budget this year included a $236 billion cut to Medicare over the next ten years. The White House defended the cut by saying such savings would come through reforms, not benefit cuts.\n\nClaim: Republicans protecting people with pre-existing conditions\n\n\"Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions,\" Trump said in Indianapolis.\n\nWe\u2019ve checked this before at length. Republicans are suing to end these protections, they've voted repeatedly to repeal the legislation that first instituted them, and the alternatives they've suggested do not protect people with pre-existing conditions the way Obamacare does.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Scientist raised the alarm and ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out worldwide.\n\nAs a result, the upper ozone layer above the Northern Hemisphere should be completely repaired in the 2030s and the gaping Antarctic ozone hole should disappear in the 2060s, according to a scientific assessment released Monday at a conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Southern Hemisphere lags a bit and its ozone layer should be healed by mid-century.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good news,\u201d said report co-chairman Paul Newman, chief Earth scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. \u201cIf ozone-depleting substances had continued to increase, we would have seen huge effects. We stopped that.\u201d\n\nHigh in the atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer, crop damage and other problems. Use of man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which release chlorine and bromine, began eating away at the ozone. In 1987, countries around the world agreed in the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and businesses came up with replacements for spray cans and other uses.\n\nAt its worst in the late 1990s, about 10 percent of the upper ozone layer was depleted, said Newman. Since 2000, it has increased by about 1 to 3 percent per decade, the report said.\n\nThis year, the ozone hole over the South Pole peaked at nearly 9.6 million square miles (24.8 million square kilometers). That\u2019s about 16 percent smaller than the biggest hole recorded \u2014 11.4 million square miles (29.6 million square kilometers) in 2006.\n\nThe hole reaches its peak in September and October and disappears by late December until the next Southern Hemisphere spring, Newman said.\n\nThe ozone layer starts at about 6 miles (10 kilometers) above Earth and stretches for nearly 25 miles (40 kilometers); ozone is a colorless combination of three oxygen atoms.\n\nIf nothing had been done to stop the thinning, the world would have destroyed two-thirds of its ozone layer by 2065, Newman said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a complete success yet, said University of Colorado\u2019s Brian Toon, who wasn\u2019t part of the report.\n\n\u201cWe are only at a point where recovery may have started,\u201d Toon said, pointing to some ozone measurements that haven\u2019t increased yet.\n\nAnother problem is that new technology has found an increase in emissions of a banned CFC out of East Asia, the report noted.\n\nOn its own, the ozone hole has slightly shielded Antarctica from the much larger effects of global warming \u2014 it has heated up but not as much as it likely would without ozone depletion, said Ross Salawitch, a University of Maryland atmospheric scientist who co-authored the report.\n\nSo a healed ozone layer will worsen man-made climate change there a bit, Newman said.\n\nScientists don\u2019t know how much a healed ozone hole will further warm Antarctica, but they do know the immediate effects of ozone depletion on the world and human health, so \u201cit would be incredibly irresponsible not to do this,\u201d Salawitch said.\n\nAnd the replacements now being used to cool cars and refrigerators need to be replaced themselves with chemicals that don\u2019t worsen global warming, Newman said. An amendment to the Montreal Protocol that goes into effect next year would cut use of some of those gases.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can do a victory lap until 2060,\u201d Newman said. \u201cThat will be for our grandchildren to do.\u201d\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The judge set his bail at $200,000 cash or $400,000 bond.

The boys allegedly offered Cheema $70 to allow two of them to ride on the roof of the vehicle as it was moving, while the third recorded a video to post on social media.\n\nThe teens withdrew their offer after deciding $70 was too much, prosecutors said. But after getting into the vehicle and traveling some distance, they later made Cheema a $40 offer to car surf that he accepted, Sini said.\n\nMullen and another teen mounted the vehicle, while the third recorded video on Snapchat, authorities said. Mullen fell from the Highlander as it drove away, striking his head on the pavement, Sini said. Cheema drove the teens to their destination.

On Oct. 23, in perhaps the surest sign yet that right-wing leaders are concerned with Medicare for All\u2019s growing popularity, the White House released a 70-page report denouncing socialist policies \u2014 with particular focus given to single-payer healthcare.\n\nWhat\u2019s provoking the flurry of attacks on Medicare for All? Perhaps it\u2019s multiple recent polls showing 52 percent of Republicans support the policy \u2014 as do 70 percent of people overall. The crisis of market-driven healthcare is felt by the vast working majority, whether a district is red or blue. Everyone but the rich is getting squeezed by claim denials and rising premiums, copays and deductibles \u2014 all while wages remain mostly stagnant.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the demand to improve and expand Medicare is going to be a major battle leading into 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the demand to improve and expand Medicare is going to be a major battle leading into 2020. But while right-wing leaders are united against the policy, we shouldn\u2019t expect corporate Democrats to fight for it either.\n\nRight now, private insurers \u2014 who donate to both parties \u2014 profit off our sickness by cutting corners and passing the costs along to us at every opportunity. The top four health insurance companies made $60 billion in profits between 2009-15, while their executives took home between $20-$66 million each year. Medicare for All would redirect that money toward its intended purpose: the provision of healthcare.\n\nBut despite saving trillions, funding Medicare for All will still require taxing the rich to guarantee care for workers, who typically spend 10 to 15 percent of theirs. It will also put an end to the $260 billion in tax giveaways we currently hand to corporations so they can \u201cafford\u201d to insure their workers.\n\nThis is why the ruling class in America, including businesses and the medical establishment, has long held a special distaste for the idea of universal healthcare. And it\u2019s why they\u2019re now setting their sights on Medicare for All.\n\nBut while they\u2019d never admit it, Trump has an ally in centrist politicians of both parties who depend on the private insurance industry\u2019s support. To these politicians, liberal and conservative, the demand for Medicare for All represents an existential threat. Trump\u2019s attack has forced Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer into the uncomfortable position of cagily defending a policy that they and their donors refuse to endorse or outright oppose, but their voters demand.\n\nThis is significant. After all, it\u2019s these same Democrats who kept single-payer off the table when passing the Affordable Care Act. And with the healthcare crisis worsening, the party establishment has focused its efforts on reforming the ACA or pushing watered-down legislation. But band-aid solutions do nothing to erase the profit motive that drives our healthcare woes, and it\u2019s evident that Republicans aren\u2019t looking to compromise anyway.\n\nFor centrist Democrats, expanding a popular social program that is cheaper than the private sector has always been something that will \u201cnever, ever\u201d \u2014 in the words of Hillary Clinton \u2014 happen. The reason for this is simple: they don\u2019t want to upset the donor class that keeps them in office.\n\nThe truth is that the fight for Medicare for All isn\u2019t between Democrats and Republicans. By framing it as such, Trump and his administration are distracting us from the real fight between the corporate class \u2014 whose interests are tied to those of insurance companies and the pharmaceutical lobby \u2014 and the rest of us, who are desperate for healthcare security.\n\nMedicare for All represents a new kind of politics \u2014 and the best alternative to the Trump administration\u2019s self-serving austerity. As the first truly universal program in U.S. history, it would set a new precedent for what working people ought to expect from the government. Winning Medicare for All would be a major step in transforming how we organize society \u2014 on the principle of solidarity, not profit.\n\nThis November, Trump wants to use fear \u2014 fear of immigrants, taxes, losing your plans \u2014 to drive turnout against democratic socialist candidates across the country who are running on single-payer.

The CDC has reports from 25 states of AFM.\n\nThe CDC and outside researchers say 2018 appears to be a year with more cases. Since a surge of cases was reported in 2014, there has been an every-other-year pattern of outbreaks. In 2014, the CDC confirmed 120 cases, but just 22 in 2015. Then case counts rose to 149 in 2016 and fell to 33 in 2017.\n\nThe CDC says it\u2019s still not clear what\u2019s causing all the cases. Some patients have been infected with a usually harmless common cold virus called enterovirus D68, or EV-D68. But not all patients have tested positive for EV-D68.\n\nOutside researchers and doctors who have treated patients say it\u2019s clear to them that viruses, including EV-D68, are causing the cases. But the CDC says the case is not so certain.\n\n\u201cCDC has tested many different specimens from AFM patients for a wide range of pathogens (germs) that can cause AFM,\u201d the agency says on its website.\n\n\u201cTo date, no pathogen (germ) has been consistently detected in the patients\u2019 spinal fluid; a pathogen detected in the spinal fluid would be good evidence to indicate the cause of AFM since this condition affects the spinal cord.\u201d\n\nSome researchers say testing spinal fluid is not the best way to find out if a respiratory virus is causing the muscle weakness and paralysis that marks AFM. They say doctors should be taking respiratory swabs, as well as blood and stool samples, as soon as a patient comes in showing symptoms.\n\nWhat researchers and the CDC do agree on is the need for quick testing and for doctors and ER staff to be aware of the symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what caused the increase in AFM cases starting in 2014,\u201d the CDC says. \u201cWe have not yet determined who is at higher risk for developing AFM, or the reasons why they may be at higher risk,\u201d it adds.\n\nA team of researchers across the country are pooling efforts to try to find out why a select few kids out of the many infected with viruses develop AFM.\n\n\u201cWe do not yet know the long-term effects of AFM. We know that some patients diagnosed with AFM have recovered quickly, and some continue to have paralysis and require ongoing care,\u201d the CDC added.\n\nNone of the patients has tested positive for polio, the CDC stresses.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for AFM, the CDC says. Once a virus has attacked the nervous system, there\u2019s no known medical intervention that can reverse the effects. Rehabilitation therapy can help patients regain function.\n\nThe CDC takes reports from each state health department and then examines the medical findings. To confirm a case requires not only that a child have symptoms of limb weakness or paralysis, but a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that shows specific damage in the spinal cord.\n\nDepending on which part of the spine is damaged, different muscles can become weak or paralyzed. This can cause a range of symptoms, from difficulty lifting an arm to severe weakening of the muscles used in breathing. That can require use of a ventilator to help the patient breathe.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

They try and play it down like its not that many people,\u201d Trump said of Democrats to rally-goers, sparking a chant of \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d\n\nAt Trump's first two campaign events on Monday, he warned, without evidence, that Democrats were encouraging illegal immigrants to vote.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and overrun our country,\" Trump said in Fort Wayne, Indiana. \"And they want to sign them up for free welfare, free healthcare, free education and most importantly the right to vote. They want them to vote.\u201d\n\nAt his final stop, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Trump repeated the crowd-pleasing lines and implored voters to pick Republicans at the polls.\n\n\"I am asking every citizen, from every party, every background, every race, color and creed to reject the Democrat politics of anger, division, destruction and to unite behind our proud, noble and righteous destiny as Americans,\" he said.\n\nHe was joined on stage at that event by conservative talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh and Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Jeannine Pirro. Hannity, who interviewed Trump before the rally, had said on Twitter that he would not participate in campaign activities.\n\nBut when Trump invited him to the stage, Hannity praised the president and repeated one of his slogans: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"\n\nHannity also slammed the press.\n\n\"By the way, all those people in the back are fake news,\" he said.\n\nPirro used her short remarks to encourage rally-goers to take friends and family to the polls to \"vote for Donald Trump and all the people who are running for the Republican Party\" \u2014 though Trump is not actually on the ballot this year.\n\nWhile many Republican strategists have fretted over Trump's focus on immigration in the closing days of the campaign \u2014 and have urged him to stick to his message on the economy \u2014 he has declined their advice. It's an issue that motivates his political base, but also one that he talks about outside of his rallies.\n\n\"All you've got to do is go around, take a look what's happened over the years and you'll see,\" Trump told reporters before departing Joint Base Andrews for Ohio. \"There are a lot of people ... that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally, so we just want to let them know that there will be prosecution at the highest level.\"\n\nExperts have repeatedly concluded that voter fraud is extremely rare. Even the president's own defunct voter fraud commission uncovered no evidence to back up his claim that millions voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election, according to an analysis of commission documents released in August by a former member.\n\nThe president again engaged in electoral expectations-setting, saying in Ohio that Tuesday could be a difficult day for Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a disadvantage,\u201d Trump said pointing to history as an indication that presidents have often lost power in Congress during their first midterm election. \"But let's see what happens.\"\n\nLater Monday, Trump downplayed any concern about the potential political and legal perils of a Democratic Congress.\n\n\"No, I don't care,\" Trump told reporters when leaving Ohio for Indiana when asked if he was at all worried about a Democratic House going after his tax returns, which he has yet to release. \"They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want.\"\n\nHe told the Fort Wayne crowd he would one day bring the country together \u2014 but not quite yet. \"I do want to eventually unite, but the fact is we are driving [Democrats] crazy,\" Trump said. \"Hopefully it is all going to come together one day, like a beautiful puzzle.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

We plan to continue to evaluate all businesses and elements of our portfolio annually,\" the company told Reuters.\n\nWhile Lowe's is far smaller and less exposed to the presence of Amazon and other online sellers, the closures follow a wave of similar moves by traditional U.S. retailers in the face of greater online competition.\n\nNew Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison began a restructuring after taking over in July and has said he was reviewing its real estate portfolio, promising to remove slow-selling products and end unsuccessful ventures.\n\nUnder Ellison, the company has also eliminated four senior positions, while creating two new senior roles for stores and supply chain.\n\n\"New blood in the upper ranks was clearly a catalyst for this decision, as we believe there is a greater willingness on behalf of the leadership team to examine the root causes of underperformance,\" Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski, said in a note.\n\nThe wind down of the Orchard Supply chain cost the company between $390 million and $475 million in write-downs. Lowe's said Monday's announcement would result in charges of 28 cents per share to 34 cents per share or $300 million to $365 million in pre-tax expenses.\n\nThe company, which operates about 1,800 U.S. stores and 300 in Canada, said it expects the closures to be completed by February, with the exception of some U.S. stores that are closing immediately.\n\nThe 20 U.S. closures are spread across states including New York, Texas and California, with 31 locations including two plants in a handful of Canadian provinces also shutting.\n\nThe majority of the impacted U.S. stores are located within 10 miles of another store.\n\nShares in the company were flat.", "Get the Better newsletter.\n\nBy Julie Compton\n\nIn October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a leading international body on climate change researchers, released an alarming report. The study found that countries around the world have just 12 years to reduce global warming before it reaches catastrophic levels.\n\nNow that we know time may be running out, the question is: What can we do about it?\n\nUnderstand how climate change will impact you\n\nIf current global temperatures rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius, as the report suggests, the warming atmosphere will create more extreme weather patterns across the U.S., according to Ben Strauss, chief scientist of Climate Central, an organization that reports on climate change. He says people across the country can expect hotter summers and milder winters, which will have a direct impact on food crops and the survival of wildlife.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting hotter, so we can expect many more days above 90 degrees or 95 degrees, depending on where you live,\u201d says Strauss.\n\nIn the West, continued wildfires will have a direct impact on air quality and human health, according to Strauss. In the Southwest, he says droughts will lead to water scarcity, while the East and Midwest will experience more torrential rainstorms. Strauss says people in eastern coastal areas, especially in low-lying communities, will see more flooding due to heavier and longer-lasting hurricanes, which will have an impact on the value of their homes. In the Northeast, he says, warmer weather will bring more tick and mosquito-born illnesses. The region will see fewer snowstorms, but the storms will become more intense due to increased moisture in the air.\n\nOne thing will surely impact people equally across the country, according to the scientist: intensifying summer heat. \u201cMany more days that are danger days in terms of human health and that are \u2018black flag\u2019 days \u2014 you get to a certain combination of heat and humidity,\u201d Strauss says.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nFocus on solutions, according to Crystal Chissell, a vice president for Project Drawdown, a coalition of researchers and scientists who are working on climate change solutions.\n\nChissell says reports of impending doom tend to cause ordinary people to feel hopeless and to shut down.\n\n\u201cWe will get a lot further toward solving the problem if we focus on solutions rather than continuing to highlight the problem,\u201d Chissell says.\n\nProject Drawdown recently put together a report highlighting 30 behavioral solutions ordinary people can take to combat climate change. The top three include wasting less food, adopting a plant-rich diet and consuming less energy and water.\n\n6 things you can do to combat climate change, according to advocacy groups\n\n1) Waste less food\n\nMethane from agricultural actives, waste management, and energy use is the second largest cause of climate change behind fossil fuels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nReducing food waste is the number-one thing consumers can do to significantly lessen their climate impact, according to the Project Drawdown report.\n\n\u201cFood that is disposed of and spoiled creates methane, and that\u2019s why it has an impact on greenhouse gases, because methane is such a strong greenhouse gas,\u201d Chissell says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why reducing food waste has such a large impact.\u201d\n\nFood waste occurs when we don\u2019t buy produce because it has blemishes or is misshapen, when we discard food because it is a day past the expiration date, or because we simply never get around to eating it, she says.\n\n2) Eat less factory-farmed red meat\n\nFactory farms feed cows grains, which cause them to release methane into the air through their gases, says Chissell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually natural to their digestive system so it creates more methane,\u201d Chissell explains.\n\nChissell says adopting a plant-rich diet, and eating more meat from organic farms where animals are fed natural diets, can help reduce methane. \u201cIt\u2019s not even necessary to be a vegan or a vegetarian,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s just reducing the amount of meat that we consume and eating plant-based [foods].\u201d\n\n3) Consume less energy and water\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely imperative to also reduce energy usage,\u201d says Chissell. \u201cFor instance, switching to LED light bulbs \u2014 that has a very large impact, as does any measure that can reduce household water use.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of actions you can take to reduce water consumption, according to Chissell, including purchasing low-flow shower heads and sink faucets, taking shorter showers and washing full loads of laundry.\n\n4) Call and meet with your representatives\n\nConstituents who do the extra legwork of calling and meeting with their representatives have a huge influence, according to Flannery Winchester, communications coordinator at Citizens' Climate Lobby, a non-partisan advocacy organization that focuses on national policies that address climate change.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not communicating with the people who are elected to represent them, then those people are not going to be prioritizing those issues,\u201d Winchester says.\n\nMany people believe their elected officials won\u2019t be swayed by their concerns, says Winchester. But when people actively lobby their representatives, she says, change does happen.\n\nFor example, Winchester says voters influenced both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives to come together to create the the Climate Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan group focused on climate change solutions.\n\n\u201cThings really are moving,\u201d says Winchester, \u201cand it\u2019s because people are taking the time to talk to their members of Congress.\u201d\n\n5) Open a dialogue and find common ground\n\nWhile there is major consensus among scientists that climate change is happening, some people may still doubt it\u2019s real, or see climate change policies as \u201cjob killers,\u201d according to Winchester.\n\nHow people talk to others about climate change is important to solving the problem, Winchester says. She says it\u2019s imperative to avoid arguing about climate change as if it is a partisan issue.\n\n\u201cReally listen, ask open-ended questions and focus on finding common ground,\u201d Winchester advises. For instance, if someone fears climate change policy will hurt coal industry jobs, re-focus the conversation on how climate change policies can create jobs, she says.\n\n\u201cFocusing on the common ground is the main thing that\u2019s going to make it possible for you to introduce new information into the conversation, because they don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re fighting with them,\u201d Winchester says.\n\n6) Volunteer\n\nA big way to be a part of the solution is to join a nonprofit organization where you live that focuses on helping the environment. Many of these organizations have membership opportunities in states and congressional districts across the country.\n\nWant more tips like these?

Given its high speed and its unusual trajectory, the reddish, stadium-sized whatever-it-is had clearly come from outside our solar system. But its flattened, elongated shape and the way it accelerated on its way through the solar system set it apart from conventional asteroids and comets.\n\nNow a pair of Harvard researchers are raising the possibility that Oumuamua is an alien spacecraft. As they say in a paper to be published Nov. 12 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the object \"may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.\"\n\nThe researchers aren't claiming outright that aliens sent Oumuamua. But after a careful mathematical analysis of the way the interstellar object sped up as it shot past the sun, they say Oumuamua could be a spacecraft pushed through space by light falling on its surface \u2014 or, as they put it in the paper, a \"lightsail of artificial origin.\"\n\nWho would have sent such a spacecraft our way \u2014 and why?\n\n\"It is impossible to guess the purpose behind Oumuamua without more data,\" Avi Loeb, chairman of Harvard's astronomy department and a co-author of the paper, told NBC News MACH in an email. If Oumuamua is a lightsail, he added, one possibility is that it was floating in interstellar space when our solar system ran into it, \"like a ship bumping into a buoy on the surface of the ocean.\"\n\nEarthlings have launched simple solar-powered lightsails of our own, and Loeb is an adviser to Breakthrough Starshot, an initiative that plans to send a fleet of tiny laser-powered lightsail craft to the nearest star system. But the technology is in its infancy \u2014 at least here on Earth.\n\nArtist's concept of a lightsail above Earth. Josh Spradling / The Planetary Society\n\nLoeb and his collaborator, Shmuel Bialy, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, acknowledge that the alien spacecraft scenario is an \"exotic\" one. And perhaps not surprisingly, other space scientists have strong doubts about it.\n\n\"It's certainly ingenious to show that an object the size of Oumuamua might be sent by aliens to another star system with nothing but a solar sail for power,\" Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, said in an email. \"But one should not blindly accept this clever hypothesis when there is also a mundane (and a priori more likely) explanation for Oumuamua \u2014 namely that it's a comet or asteroid from afar.\"\n\nCoryn Bailer-Jones, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, voiced similar objections. \"In science,\" he said in an email, \"we must ask ourselves, \"Where is the evidence?, not \"Where is the lack of evidence so that I can fit in any hypothesis that I like?\"\n\nBailer-Jones, who earlier this year led a group of scientists who identified four dwarf stars as likely origin points for Oumuamua, raised questions in particular about the object's tumbling motion.\n\n\"Why send a spacecraft which is doing this?\" he said. \"If it were a spacecraft, this tumbling would make it impossible to keep any instruments pointed at the Earth. Of course, one could now say it was an accident, or the aliens did this to deceive us. One can always come up with increasingly implausible suggestions that have no evidence in order to maintain an idea.\"\n\nBut Loeb called the conjecture \"purely scientific and evidence-based,\" adding, \"I follow the maxim of Sherlock Holmes: When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"\n\nThe truth may be hard to establish, as Oumuamua has left the solar system and is no longer visible even with telescopes. In any case, Loeb said, the fact that we've observed one interstellar object like Oumuama suggests that others may be out there \u2014 and astronomers should begin a search for them.\n\n\"A survey for lightsails as technosignatures [of extraterrestrial civilizations] in the solar system is warranted,\" he said, \"irrespective of whether Oumuamua is one of them.\"\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Circuit in favor of net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to offer equal access to all web content.\n\nThose rules were put in place by the Federal Communications Commission under President Barack Obama, but have since been rolled back under the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision leaves in place the previous Circuit Court ruling that found the FCC acted legally in passing its net neutrality rules.\n\nGigi Sohn, a former lawyer at the FCC who is now a fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology, Law and Policy, said the ruling was significant because the Circuit Court ruling helped form the basis of a variety of legal challenges leveled at the FCC's repeal of the rules.\n\n\"The FCC and industry had argued that because the Trump FCC has repealed the 2015 rules, the 2016 decision was moot, and the Supreme Court should wipe it from the books,\" Sohn said in an email. \"Now that the Supreme Court has refused to do so, parties challenging the 2017 net neutrality repeal order can continue to rely on that 2016 decision, which provides strong support for their argument that the 2017 repeal is contrary to law.\"\n\nJessica Rosenworcel, the lone Democratic FCC Commissioner who has been a vocal advocate of net neutrality rules,\u200f tweeted Monday that the decision was \"interesting.\"\n\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai called the previous regulations \"micromanaging\" of the internet.\n\nUnder the current rules, the Federal Trade Commission is tasked with policing how internet service providers handle web traffic in order to prevent \"anti-competitive\" behavior. Critics of the law believe this opens the door for service providers to charge additional fees or censor certain content.\n\nMany U.S. states have sought to establish their own net neutrality rules, and 21 states and D.C. sued the FCC over its repeal of the regulations.\n\nIn late September, shortly after California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law to restore the state's net neutrality laws, the U.S. Justice Department filed a federal action to block the law.

The children say they were kidnapped late Sunday by the armed men and they don't know where they are being held.\n\nThe men who identify themselves on the video as the kidnappers say they will only release the children when they achieve what they want.\n\n\"We shall only release you after the struggle. You will be going to school now here,\" say the men. The video could not be independently verified, but parents have said on social media that they recognize their children in the video.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Amnesty International Deputy Regional Director for West and Central Africa Samira Daoud called the abduction \"appalling\" and said they exemplify the price the general public is paying as violence escalates in the region.\n\n\"The abduction of schoolchildren and teachers can never be justified. Whoever is responsible must release and return the victims immediately,\" Daoud said.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe express solidarity with the families of these children and demand that the Cameroon authorities do everything in their power to ensure all the pupils and school staff are freed unharmed. In a case with a chilling echo of the 2014 kidnappings of the Chibok schoolgirls in Nigeria, it is vital that Cameroon\u2019s government act swiftly and decisively to reunite these children with their loved ones.\"\n\nHundreds have been killed in Cameroon's Anglophone regions in the past year, where violence between armed separatists and the military has increased since a government crackdown against protesters in the northwest and southwest regions. The demonstrators claim that as the English-speaking minority they are marginalized by the French-speaking government.\n\nViolent separatists have since taken up arms to destabilize the Anglophone regions to win independence for the areas they want to declare a separate state, which they call Ambazonia. They have mounted attacks against civilians who do not support their cause.\n\nThere have been other kidnappings from schools in the region, but this is the largest number kidnapped at once. Armed separatists have even killed teachers who defied instructions to keep schools closed. They have torched at least a hundred schools and chased students and teachers from schools which they then take over as training grounds.\n\nLast week separatist militants attacked workers on a state-run rubber plantation in southwestern Cameroon, chopping off their fingers because the men had defied an order to stay away from the farms.\n\nAn American missionary also died in the northwest region around Bamenda when he was shot in the head amid fighting between armed separatists and soldiers.\n\nThe turmoil in Cameroon comes as President Paul Biya, who has led since 1982, easily won a seventh term last month in an election that the United States says was marked by irregularities. The government did away with presidential term limits several years ago, part of a trend in Africa that has dismayed many.

These days more and more people, particularly millennials like me, are going the way of social impact entrepreneurship. Social enterprises are being called \u201cthe new black,\u201d \u201ca new paradigm for business,\u201d even \u201ca possible future for global capitalism.\u201d It\u2019s little surprise, given that one survey found 94 percent of millennials want to use their skills to benefit a cause.\n\nBut the rosy picture this can create \u2014 getting scrappy, living a pared-down life with more meaning \u2014 leaves out some of the big pitfalls social entrepreneurs face. There\u2019s a lot that I didn\u2019t know before making the jump from investment banking to launching Givz. These are lessons I\u2019ve learned along the way.\n\n1. You will question your decision, often\n\nI\u2019ve often gone to bed filled with worries. And I\u2019ve had nightmares \u2014 recurring dreams that everything fell apart, or a big contract fell through. Of course, I\u2019ve had these worries during the day, too.\n\nI\u2019ve learned to counteract these fears by asking myself one question: If I still had my old job, and was offered the chance to leave it and take over Givz today, would I say yes? My answer has always been yes. That\u2019s how I know I\u2019m on the right path.\n\n2. You will fall into the \u201cgrass is greener\u201d trap\n\nIt\u2019s easy to daydream about having no financial worries. I\u2019m fortunate that my wife has steady work, which has allowed us to take this risk. Then again, we have our first child on the way, which of course increases stress.\n\nI\u2019ve taken on a new mindset about money: that it\u2019s like blood. You need enough, and a little extra in case you need a transfusion. But in general, having boxes of stored blood is not necessary right now. We have enough.\n\nMore importantly, because of the nature of my work, I get to see every day how incredibly fortunate we are. I\u2019m constantly interacting with charities that serve people in awful conditions \u2014 people in real dire straits. When you see pure gratitude and joy on someone\u2019s face because of what you've created, it\u2019s the most powerful reward. Always keep in mind the people you\u2019re aiming to help. It restores perspective.\n\n3. People will think it\u2019s going better than you feel it is\n\nAnytime you\u2019re able to announce a step forward \u2014 some funding raised, for example \u2014 you\u2019ll get lots of congratulations from people you know. They won\u2019t know all the blood, sweat and tears that went into it. And they won\u2019t know about your constant anxiety and exhaustion.\n\nI\u2019ve learned to play along, and tell people that things are, indeed, awesome. To share the highs, but not the lows. You want people in general to be excited about what you\u2019re doing \u2014 and for that to happen, you need to project that excitement yourself. If you talk too much about the lows, pointing out how many startups fail for example, people think that you don\u2019t fully believe in what you\u2019re doing. To grow your enterprise, highlight the highs \u2014 and save the struggles for the people closest to you.\n\n4. Celebrate your successes\n\nFor all these reasons and more, it\u2019s important to pause and appreciate all the achievements along the way, both big and small. The first time we sent along a check to a charity that was donated through our platform, we took a moment to enjoy it. And recently, we signed a very exciting contract that can help millions of people donate to all sorts of causes. We could have immediately started worrying about the next steps \u2014 how to maximize the opportunity and get the work done \u2014 but we took a moment to congratulate each other on the accomplishment.\n\nAs a social entrepreneur, you have a different relationship to the work. No one\u2019s telling you what to do, and there may be no one to tell you when you\u2019ve done something good. So you have to make sure to own each achievement, and use it to energize you to tackle the next mountain of work.\n\nTo grow your enterprise, highlight the highs \u2014 and save the struggles for the people closest to you.\n\nUltimately, building a career around social impact is a win-win. Our metrics for success \u2014 growing the business; helping more and more charities; facilitating more donations, bringing more attention to social causes and more \u2014 involve doing good for everyone involved. It\u2019s something I\u2019d never get being a cog in a wheel at a company.\n\nAs my future child grows up, I want him or her to see that. That you can live by purpose. You can create something aimed at doing good in the world. It takes a leap of faith. But it\u2019s worth it.\n\nMore Stories About Taking Chances\n\nWant more tips like these?

[Science Fact or Fiction? The Plausibility of 10 Sci-Fi Concepts]\n\nBut SpiNNaker doesn't just \"think\" like a brain. It creates models of the neurons in human brains, and it simulates more neurons in real time than any other computer on Earth, according to the statement.\n\n\"Its primary task is to support partial brain models: \u00adfor example, models of cortex, of basal ganglia, or multiple regions \u00adexpressed typically as networks of spiking [or firing] neurons,\" Furber told Live Science in an email.\n\nDouble the processors\n\nSince April 2016, SpiNNaker has been simulating neuron activity using 500,000 core processors, but the upgraded machine has twice that capacity, Furber explained. With the support of the European Union's Human Brain Project \u2014 an effort to construct a virtual human brain \u2014 SpiNNaker will continue to enable scientists to create detailed brain models. But now it has the capacity to perform 200 quadrillion actions simultaneously, university representatives reported in the statement.\n\nWhile some other computers may rival SpiNNaker in the number of processors they contain, what sets this platform apart is the infrastructure connecting those processors. In the human brain, 100 billion neurons simultaneously fire and transmit signals to thousands of destinations. SpiNNaker's architecture supports an exceptional level of communication among its processors, behaving much like a brain's neural network does, Furber explained.\n\n\"Conventional supercomputers have connectivity mechanisms that are much less well\u00adsuited to real\u00adtime brain modeling,\" he said. \"SpiNNaker is, I believe, capable of modeling larger spiking neural networks in biological real time than any other machine.\"\n\nMind over matter\n\nPreviously, when SpiNNaker was operating with only 500,000 processors, it modeled 80,000 neurons in the cortex, the brain region that moderates data from the senses. Another SpiNNaker simulation of the basal ganglia, a brain area affected by Parkinson's disease, hints at the computer's potential as a tool for studying brain disorders, according to the statement.\n\nSpiNNaker can also control a mobile robot called SpOmnibot, which uses the computer to interpret data from the robot's vision sensors and make navigation choices in real time, university representatives said.\n\nWith all its computing power and brain-like capabilities, how close is SpiNNaker to behaving like a real human brain? For now, exactly simulating a human brain is simply not possible, Furber said. An advanced machine such as SpiNNaker can still manage only a fraction of the communication performed by a human brain, and supercomputers have a long way to go before they can think for themselves, Furber wrote in the email.\n\n\"Even with a million processors, we can only approach 1 percent of the scale of the human brain, and that's with a lot of simplifying assumptions,\" he said.\n\nHowever, SpiNNaker could mimic the function of a mouse brain, which is 1,000 times smaller than a human brain, Furber added.\n\n\"If a mouse thinks mouse-\u00adsized thoughts and all that is required is enough neurons wired together in the right structure (which is itself a debatable point), then maybe we can now reach that level of thinking in a model running on SpiNNaker,\" he said.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.\n\nWant more stories about technology?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By John Lapinski, Katie Primm and Stephanie Perry\n\nNBC News is a member of the National Election Pool, a consortium formed by NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN. The NEP consortium, along with Edison Research, conducts exit and absentee polls, provides precinct votes in selected sample precincts and runs models for the analysis of the election information. The NEP also delivers statewide vote counts, as well as county by county results, for general elections and district votes in House races.\n\nNBC News election unit analysts will first examine exit polls, any absentee polls and statistical estimates based upon this data in a given race to determine if the race can be called. As election night goes on, analysts also examine vote results from selected sample precincts, county-by-county model results, the actual raw votes (both statewide and county by county) and additional statistical information. In order to make a race call, all senior election unit analysts must agree, the NBC News director of elections must agree and the senior news division management representative must agree. If everyone agrees, a call is made.\n\nNBC News will not project a winner in a race until after the last scheduled poll closing time in that race. If the race appears to be close in any state, an abundance of caution will be used before calling a race in that state.\n\nThe large number of absentee and early voting has required that our election projection methods ensure that absentee voters are properly accounted for. Absentee ballot polls and analysis of early-voting data will be conducted when appropriate and statistical models account for this trend.\n\nThe director of NBC News' decision desk, the decision analysts and the quality-control desk operate independently from NBC News editorial teams and outside election reporting.\n\nUnderstanding election night calls\n\nNBC News will be clear about its nomenclature during the entire election process. In addition, NBC News will explain methodology for collecting data it presents. Here are some terms you will hear on NBC and MSNBC and read on NBCNews.com on election night:\n\nProjected winner: NBC has made a projection that a candidate will win the race, but the vote count is not complete. This call is made only after all the polls are scheduled to have closed in that race.\n\nApparent winner: NBC has tallied enough votes to indicate that a candidate has won the race, but the results may well depend upon a potential recount or final official tallies.\n\nWinner: A candidate who has clearly won the race, beyond the normal margin for a recount. \"Winner\" will not be used unless returns make the outcome a virtual certainty.\n\nNote that none of these terms refers to the \"official\" winner, since most states take weeks to officially certify a winner in an election.\n\nToo early to call: There is not enough data to allow analysts to make a call.\n\nToo close to call: While there is data on the race, the numbers are too close to allow analysts to make a call.\n\nSenate Composition: The Decision Desk tracks individual Senate races. This is not a projection of the entire Senate but reported results \u201cat this hour\u201d as individual races are called. The composition will show the totals in the new Senate by party, showing the new called races added in with seats that are not up for re-election this year.\n\nHouse Estimate: This is a projection of the House as a whole. For each of the 435 individual House races, the Decision Desk calculates the probability of a Democratic, Republican or independent victory in that House seat, based on pre-election research. During the night, election analysts examine all the available vote data and adjust the probabilities for each House seat that changes from its pre-election probability. The model then calculates the most probable outcome of the election in the House and also calculates an estimate of the probability of error expressed as a number of seats plus or minus. Based on the House Estimate, there is also a probability of a certain party winning control of the House.\n\nIn addition, individual House calls are made and tracked throughout the night. Like the Senate composition, the individual House races will be tallied as races are called and may not add to 435 called races on election night.\n\nUnderstanding results on NBCNews.com\n\nNBCNews.com.com receives data from the NEP, which gathers three sets of data on Election Day: 1) Exit polls, conducted by the NEP 2) Projection information that is used by NBC to \"call,\" or project, a race once all the polls have closed 3) Unofficial vote tallies, as reported by election officials.\n\nFor exit polls, voters leaving the polling place in selected voting districts are handed a questionnaire with both demographic (sex, race, age) and attitudinal questions (Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?). They are also asked to indicate how they voted. Those responses are collected and then transmitted to the NEP, so the results are tabulated and reported.\n\nNBC News, along with the NEP, is conducting exit polls of voters as they exit their polling place on Election Day. This is the only in-person poll on Election Day. The data is valuable because its a true measure of voters. We know that the respondents have just voted because they exit their polling place and are handed a survey.\n\nThe in-person exit poll is also supplemented with a telephone poll in states with high absentee and early voting to get an accurate picture of who voters are and what motivated them to vote on Election Day.\n\nFor vote tallies, results are gathered from election officials in each state as the vote is reported. These are \"unofficial\" returns because the tallies have not been rechecked and certified by state election authorities.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Critics said it was aimed at stirring up anger toward immigrants before Election Day.\n\nBrad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, tweeted that NBC, CNN and Facebook \"have chosen to stand\" with undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"The #FakeNewsMedia and #PaloAltoMafia are trying to control what you see and how you think,\" Parscale tweet. \"STOP THE CARAVAN!\"\n\nAs he boarded Air Force One on Monday, Trump was asked by a reporter about claims that the ad is offensive.\n\n\"Well, a lot of things are offensive,\" Trump said. \"Your questions are offensive a lot of times.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy David Wasserman\n\nA day before the midterms, Democrats appear poised for a suburban wave.\n\nThanks to President Donald Trump's terrible approval ratings among college-educated women, a historic number of GOP open seats and staggering Democratic fundraising, Democrats remain favorites to pick up the 23 seats they need for House control.\n\nBut it's still not a done deal.\n\nRepublicans point to rising overall approval numbers for Trump (46 percent in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal survey), strong jobs numbers and a narrowing Democratic voting enthusiasm advantage as evidence that they could still hang on. But at the district level, their list of problems has continued to grow.\n\nIn the final stretch, Republican polling numbers haven't gotten any better in upscale suburban \"Whole Foods\" districts where members like Rep. Barbara Comstock of Northern Virginia, Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado and Rep. Kevin Yoder of Kansas continue to trail.\n\nAt the same time, there is some evidence that GOP fortunes have marginally improved in \"Trump Zone\" districts where the president won by double digits in 2016 \u2014 places like downstate Illinois, upstate New York and the Iron Range of Minnesota.\n\nHowever, the most noticeable pattern in the last three weeks has been a shift toward Democrats in middle-income outer suburbs that voted for Trump by single digits in 2016, including districts represented by Rep. Randy Hultgren of Illinois, Rep. Mike Bishop of Michigan and Rep. Mia Love of Utah.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I identified nine types of races that will decide the House's fate. The battleground has expanded slightly since then and spans many different slices of America \u2014 from Alaska to the professional suburbs of Atlanta. Here's a breakdown of what we estimate Democrats need in each of these nine categories to prevail on Tuesday:\n\n1. Vulnerable Dem Open Seats\n\nIf Republicans are going to hold their majority, they'll need to succeed on offense. Most Democratic incumbents are in excellent shape, but the party holds five at-risk open seats. Of those, they're sure to lose Pennsylvania's 14th District, which Rep. Conor Lamb is leaving to run in a nearby seat after the state's map was redrawn. The next two most vulnerable open seats are in rural Minnesota. Democrats probably need: to hold two of five.\n\n2. Republicans in White-Collar Suburbs Won by Clinton in '16\n\nDemocrats' \"blue wave\" is most super-charged in elite, professional suburbs where Trump is woefully unpopular with college-educated voters, particularly women. Ten GOP incumbents are at risk in Clinton-won districts, including areas such as Orange County, California, and the suburbs of Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City. Rep. Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia is the single most likely to lose. Democrats probably need: to flip seven of 10.\n\n3. GOP Open Seats Won by Clinton in '16\n\nIt's not just a \"blue wave,\" it's a \"red exodus\": There are 41 open or vacant Republican seats, the most since at least 1930. Of those, the most problematic for the GOP are the eight districts Clinton carried in 2016. History is working against the GOP: Since 1992, in situations when a president's party was stuck defending an open seat two years after the president failed to carry it, that party has batted zero for 23 keeping it in their column.\n\nDemocrats are almost guaranteed to pick up Pennsylvania's 5th and 6th Districts after the state's Supreme Court redrew them in February to be much more heavily Democratic. One of Republicans' better opportunities to hang on to one of these seats is in Florida's 27th District, a 76 percent Hispanic district where Democrats nominated former HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, who doesn't speak Spanish. Democrats probably need: to flip seven of eight.\n\n4. GOP Open Seats Won by Trump in '16\n\nThere are 11 more highly vulnerable Republican open seats that Trump carried, ranging from a seat he won by a point (New Jersey's 11th District) to one he carried by 50 points (West Virginia's 3rd District). They include Speaker Paul Ryan's seat in Wisconsin, and two districts where Republican incumbents lost primaries: Rep. Robert Pittenger's seat in North Carolina and Rep. Mark Sanford's seat in South Carolina.\n\nDemocrats are virtually guaranteed to pick up New Jersey's 2nd District, where popular moderate Rep. Frank LoBiondo is retiring and national Republicans withdrew support for their nominee upon learning of his comments critical of racial diversity. They're also well-positioned to pick up New Jersey's 11th District, where Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen chose not to seek re-election. Democrats probably need: to flip four of 12.\n\n5. Republicans in Bellwether Suburbs\n\nTen vulnerable GOP incumbents represent suburban districts Trump carried by a single-digit margin in 2016, and most represent a mix of professional and middle-class voters. Several, like Georgia's 6th District, Illinois' 14th District, Michigan's 8th District and Ohio's 1st District, were gerrymandered to protect Republicans, but political trends have caused the GOP's advantage to unravel. Democrats probably need: to flip three of 12.\n\n6. Republicans in Majority Nonwhite Districts\n\nAnother six Republicans represent districts where majorities of their constituents are nonwhite. All but Georgia's 7th District voted for Clinton in 2016. Democrats' challenge is that some of these incumbents are personally popular and Latino turnout typically plummets in midterms. Rep. Will Hurd in Texas's 23rd District is probably in the best shape, in part thanks to his vocal criticism of the president on immigration. Democrats probably need: to flip two of eight.\n\n7. Republicans Representing 'Trump Surge Zones'\n\nSix vulnerable Republicans represent heavily white, working-class districts that previously voted for Barack Obama but swung hard to Trump in 2016. Rep. Rod Blum in northeastern Iowa is the most vulnerable, but Rep. Mike Bost in Illinois and Rep. Bruce Poliquin in Maine are also in serious jeopardy. These are places where the Kavanaugh fight may have boosted the GOP, especially in upstate New York. Democrats probably need: to flip two of six.\n\n8. Republicans in Districts with Urban/Rural Divides\n\nDemocrats have pickup chances in 12 districts that combine midsize cities and large rural components. In a big wave, the risk for Republicans is that energized Democrats in cities like Des Moines, Iowa; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Spokane, Washington, turn out at sky-high rates while voters in red, rural surrounding areas stay home. Rep. David Young in Iowa is probably at the greatest risk. Democrats probably need: to flip one of 12.\n\n9. Republicans with Self-Inflicted Wounds\n\nFinally, there are seven Republicans who have no one to blame but themselves for their political woes in Trump-won districts. They include Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York, whose ruby-red seats wouldn't otherwise be in play if it weren't for the fact they are running for re-election under indictment.\n\nNew on this list: Rep. Steve King of Iowa, whose comments on race and travels to Europe to meet with far-right political figures have drawn condemnations from members of both parties. Still, in this polarized political era, Democrats would need a tsunami to beat any of them. Democrats probably need: None; any of these seats would be icing on their cake.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

White\n\nWith control of Congress coming down to the wire in a nail-biter of a midterm election cycle, the economy has become a political football.\n\n\u201cThese are incredible numbers. Keep it going, Vote Republican!\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday in response to Labor Department data showing an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent and 250,000 jobs created in October.\n\nEven in the unlikely instance that Democrats regain control of both houses of Congress, economists dismiss Trump\u2019s warnings of economic apocalypse, and discount the notion that a GOP-led government is a silver bullet against an economic downturn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a Democratic Congress will be able to implement an anti-business agenda. It\u2019s not clear the Democrats have an anti-business agenda,\u201d said said Nicolas Veron, senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels, and at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\u201cI think if the Democrats win the House, or win the House and the Senate, there will be no substantive economic policy done in the next two years. I think it\u2019ll be a gridlocked government,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nStock market\n\nTrump has frequently touted soaring stock prices, but recent volatility \u2014 primarily over profit worries \u2014 has injected a note of uncertainty into the narrative. \u201cThe market was already jittery before the election,\u201d Veron said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get a clear sense of what drives the markets,\u201d he said.\n\nOne big reason for the current volatility stems from worry that Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies will cut into earnings and stifle economic growth. In this case, having a legislative branch that seeks to thwart Trump could be viewed as a positive. \u201cIf one believes the recent wobbles of the market are linked to the trade war, then a Democratic victory should reassure the market,\u201d Veron said.\n\nRecession\n\nA recent survey by the National Association for Business Economics found that 56 percent of experts think the next recession will begin in 2020. \u201cTrade issues are clearly influencing panelists' views,\" NABE survey chair David Altig wrote in the report accompanying the survey.\n\n\u201cHalf of survey respondents have moderately increased their inflation forecasts as a result of trade policy changes,\u201d Altig said, pointing out that nearly 80 percent of respondents lowered their expectations for GDP growth next year.\n\nJobs\n\nIn endorsements for lawmakers around the country, Trump made the case that Republican candidates will \u201cprotect your jobs.\u201d But a buoyant labor market depends on consumers being able \u2014 and willing \u2014 to continue spending.\n\n\u201cThe jobs market has gotten all juiced up by the [tax-cut] stimulus,\u201d Zandi said.\u201d That\u2019s supported a lot of job growth\u2026 Once the stimulus fades \u2014 and it will \u2014 the job market will also suffer.\u201d\n\nAnd with wages slow to recover, some warn this leaves many households ill prepared for the next economic slump. A Bankrate survey conducted last month found only 38 percent of Americans said their finances had improved since Trump\u2019s election in 2016, while 17 percent said their situations had worsened, and 45 percent said there had been no change.\n\n\u201cUltimately, a rising economic tide lifts many boats. It does not lift all of them,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.\n\nInflation\n\nIn the long term, Zandi predicted that another two years of a GOP-led Congress could lead to more financial pain for Americans. As the stimulative impact of the tax cuts wear off, lawmakers would face political pressure to extend expiring provisions, or create additional tax incentives altogether, even if that means taking on more debt. \u201cClearly there would be another deficit-funded tax cut, which would raise the odds of recession down the road,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think gridlock is better than the policy we\u2019d get if Republicans remain in control of government. Doing nothing is better than that alternative,\u201d he said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nParents who hit their kids may believe that a swat \u201cjust gets their attention\u201d or imposes old-fashioned discipline, but spanking in fact makes behavior worse than it was before and can cause long-term harm, pediatricians said Monday.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics strengthened its advice against corporal punishment in update guidelines, saying it makes kids more aggressive and raises the risk of mental health issues.\n\n\u201cExperiencing corporal punishment makes it more, not less, likely that children will be defiant and aggressive in the future,\u201d the group says in its new guidelines to pediatricians.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no benefit to spanking,\u201d said Dr. Robert Sege of Tufts Medical Center in Boston, who helped write the guidelines.\n\n\u201cWe know that children grow and develop better with positive role modeling and by setting healthy limits. We can do better.\u201d\n\nVerbal abuse and humiliation is also counterproductive, the pediatrics group said.\n\n\u201cParents, other caregivers, and adults interacting with children and adolescents should not use corporal punishment (including hitting and spanking), either in anger or as a punishment for or consequence of misbehavior, nor should they use any disciplinary strategy, including verbal abuse, that causes shame or humiliation,\u201d the group says in the updated guidelines.\n\n\"Within a few minutes, children are often back to their original behavior. It certainly doesn\u2019t teach children self-regulation,\" Sege told NBC News.\n\n\"Techniques such as time out and other effective forms of punishment, the goal is to teach the child to regulate herself, so that she will have the ability to control and manage her own behavior. And that\u2019s what it really is all about.\"\n\nAmericans still strongly believe in beating, spanking or paddling children, both at home and in school.\n\n\u201cAccording to a 2004 survey, approximately two-thirds of parents of young children reported using some sort of physical punishment,\u201d the pediatrics group said.\n\n\u201cThese parents reported that by fifth grade, 80 percent of children had been physically punished, and 85 percent of teenagers reported exposure to physical punishment, with 51 percent having been hit with a belt or similar object.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2013, a Harris Interactive poll found that 70 percent of parents agreed with the statement that \u201cgood, hard spanking is sometimes necessary to discipline a child,\u201d although that\u2019s down from 84 percent of parents in 1986.\n\nBut things are changing, Sege said.\n\n\"If you limit your surveys to people who have a child aged 5 years and younger in their homes, who are a new generation of parents, most of them don\u2019t like to spank their children and often don\u2019t spank their children,\" he said. \"We think there\u2019s a generational shift where today\u2019s parents are much less likely to spank their children than their parents were.\"\n\nOne group studied parents in their home and found most parents did give kids a verbal warning before physically striking out. But they did not wait long. \u201cCorporal punishment then occurred at a mean of 30 seconds later, suggesting that parents may have been \u2018responding either impulsively or emotionally rather than instrumentally and intentionally,\u2019\u201d the pediatrics group said.\n\nIt did little good.\n\n\u201cThe effects of corporal punishment were transient: within 10 minutes, most children (73 percent) had resumed the same behavior for which they had been punished.\u201d\n\nNot only does hitting kids do little good; it can worsen their long-term behavior.\n\n\u201cChildren who experience repeated use of corporal punishment tend to develop more aggressive behaviors, increased aggression in school, and an increased risk of mental health disorders and cognitive problems,\u201d Sege said in a statement.\n\nThat held even when parents were otherwise warm and loving.\n\nParents who hit their children often have serious problems of their own. \u201cParents who suffer from depression tended to use corporal punishment more frequently. In addition, family economic challenges, mental health problems, intimate partner violence and substance abuse all are associated with increased reliance on corporal punishment,\u201d Sege said.\n\n\u201cOne small report suggested that parents who themselves have a history of trauma are more likely to use corporal punishment than other parents.\u201d\n\nSo what can parents do instead?\n\n\u201cFirst, establish a positive, supporting and loving relationship with your child. Without this foundation, your child has no reason, other than fear, to demonstrate good behavior,\u201d the AAP advises.\n\n\u201cSecond, use positive reinforcement to increase the behavior you want from your child.\u201d\n\nTime outs work very well for younger children, the group said. \u201cDiscipline older children by temporarily removing favorite privileges, such as sports activities or playing with friends. If you have questions about disciplining your children, talk with your pediatrician,\u201d it advises.\n\nPediatricians will almost always recommend discipline that does not include hitting children, or forcing them to eat spices, washing their mouths out with soap or other abusive punishments. Only 6 percent of the 787 US pediatricians surveyed in 2016 approved of spanking, and only 2.5 percent actually expected it to do any good.\n\nThe American Psychological Association says positive reinforcement is more effective than spanking.\n\n\u201cPositive reinforcement for alternative behaviors is extremely effective,\u201d it says.", "As the week closes out in the Florida recount legal battle for the Senate and governor's races, most of the filings in federal court have been ruled on and there remains one more in state court that we are watching closely from Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson's team, which is attempting to argue that all 588,000-plus ballots in Palm Beach County for the Senate race should be hand recounted. It's unclear how that ruling will come down, but it\u2019s being heard today.\n\nHere are the week\u2019s top cases, how they were ruled on and why it matters. These may change and more cases could be added but here is the current state of play:\n\nDemocratic Executive Committee of Florida vs. FL Secretary of State Ken Detzner\n\nThe issue: Signature matching on vote-by-mail, absentee, and provisional ballots.\n\nThe ruling: In favor of Democrats \u2014 signature matching deadline is extended until Saturday at 5 p.m. Republican lawyers filed an appeal in circuit court, which was then denied.\n\nWhat does it mean? About 4,000 voters whose ballots were rejected due to signature matching issues now have an opportunity to \u201ccure\u201d or rectify those issues so that their vote may be counted.\n\nVote Vets, DNC, DSCC vs. Detzner\n\nThe issue: Deadlines for vote-by mail ballots and whether they should be counted based on when they are received by counties OR when they are postmarked (current rule says when they are received).\n\nThe ruling: None yet.\n\nWhat does it mean? If a judge were to rule that ballots should be counted based on when they are post-marked, not when they are received, it would put thousands more votes into play statewide.\n\nDSCC v. Detzner\n\nThe issue: How voter intent is judged during a hand recount.\n\nThe ruling: Judge Mark Walker said rules about voter intent \u2014 consistency and \u201cmagic words\u201d \u2014 are Constitutional, a decision that went against the Democratic side.\n\nWhat does it mean? For voters who didn\u2019t fill out the ballot correctly, consistent use of X\u2019s, O\u2019s, stars, etc. throughout a ballot shows a clear voter intent, as does explicitly writing \u201cVote for [Candidate]\u201d.\n\nDSCC v. Detzner\n\nThe issue: Extending deadlines for counties to complete their machine recounts\n\nThe ruling: The judge denied Democrats' request for counties to get more time for their machine recounts. This case was filed and decided on before Thursday\u2019s 3 p.m. deadline for counties to finish their machine recounts.\n\nWhat does it mean? Counties, like Palm Beach, and others who didn\u2019t finish their machine recount by the 3 p.m. Thursday deadline were not given more time to do so by the court.\n\nLeague of Women Voters and Common Cause vs. Rick Scott\n\nThe issue: That GOP Gov. Rick Scott should recuse himself in his capacity as governor from anything having to do with the recount process. (Reminder: Scott did recuse himself on Wednesday, as he had done in his previous 2014 election, kind of rendering this case moot).\n\nThe ruling: Request rejected \u2014 but with some choice words for how Rick Scott has conducted himself during this process. Judge Walker described the governor as \u201ccareening perilously close to a due process violation\u201d because of his press conference held in front of the FL Gov\u2019s mansion on Nov.8th.\n\nWhat does it mean? Not much. Scott is an elected official who is running for office, so he can\u2019t do much about the fact that he\u2019s governor while running for Senate. And he already recused himself before this case was heard, so tangible action was kind of impossible from the court.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

All sides have been accused of violating international law and committing war crimes.\n\nA girl suffering from severe malnutrition is weighed at a hospital in Yemen on Oct. 25.

It also refuels their jets mid-air, provides training and shares intelligence. So if the U.S. wants to try to force the Saudis' hands, it has leverage.\n\nThe best way to force the Saudis to change their ways is to stop sending weapons, according to Human Rights Watch\u2019s Yemen researcher Kristine Beckerle.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so many violations already over the past three and a half years, so what Pompeo and Mattis should be doing is saying, \u2018These are the benchmarks.

The U.S. government agreed to sell more than $79 billion in arms to Riyadh over that period.\n\nIn a May 2017 stop in Saudi Arabia \u2014 his first trip abroad as president \u2014 Donald Trump announced $110 billion in immediate sales of U.S. arms and equipment, with $350 billion in additional deals over the next 10 years.\n\nWhile it is unclear how much of Trump's announcement covered deals that had already been unveiled, the president has touted such arms sales to the Saudis in an effort to explain the importance of the relationship with the kingdom. American officials have also been keen to focus on what they say is the country's key role on combating terrorism and fighting Iranian influence throughout the region.\n\nAndrew Smith of the Campaign Against Arms Trade said last week's calls for a cease-fire by Mattis and Pompeo were long overdue.\n\n\"Over the last three and a half years Saudi-led forces have inflicted a terrible humanitarian catastrophe on Yemen,\" he said. \"We hope that the current pressure can serve as a turning point.

Independent computer scientists told The Associated Press that it enables anyone with access to an individual voter's personal information to alter that voter's record.\n\nIn response, Kemp asked the FBI on Sunday to investigate the Democratic Party for trying to hack the system.\n\nKemp's office did not detail any Democratic acts, offering no evidence for beginning a probe of his partisan opposition days before an election.\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams told ABCNEWS on Monday that she believes her opponent \"cooked up the charge, because he realizes, once again, he left the personal information of six million voters vulnerable. This has happened twice before.\"\n\n\"This is another failure of his leadership, and he recognizes that if he got caught two days before the election having exposed so many Georgians, he would lose, so he did what he always does always, blame someone else for his mistakes,\" she said.\n\nPolls suggest Kemp and Abrams are locked in a tight race that already evolved into a bitter back-and-forth over voting rights and ballot security.\n\nThe state Democratic Party called Kemp's accusation \"a reckless and unethical ploy\" and said he was using the FBI to support \"false accusations.\"\n\nAccording to AP interviews and records released by the Georgia Democratic Party, the lawyer for the election-security advocates, David Cross, notified both the FBI and Kemp's counsel Saturday morning that a citizen had alerted him to the flaw. But the citizen had separately informed the Georgia Democratic Party, whose voter protection director then sent an email to two computer security officials.\n\n\"If this report is accurate, it is a massive vulnerability,\" wrote the director, Sara Tindall Ghazal. Party officials provided the AP with the email, its recipients' names redacted.\n\nNeither Cross nor the state party went public.\n\nBut reporters for the online news outlet WhoWhatWhy obtained a copy of the Ghazal email and the email that Democratic Party officials received from the private citizen who discovered the flaw, Richard Wright.\n\nThey published a story Sunday just as Kemp's office released its statement accusing Democrats of attempted hacking.\n\n\"While we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cybercrimes,\" said Candice Broce, who works for Kemp.\n\nRebecca DeHart, executive director at the state Democratic Party, said no one from Kemp's office notified the Democratic Party or asked any question about the correspondence before issuing its public announcement of an investigation.\n\nWhoWhatWhy's story said five security experts had reviewed the Wright complaint and independently confirmed that the database is vulnerable to hacking.\n\nOne of those experts, University of Michigan computer scientist Matthew Bernhard, told the AP that anyone with access to an individual voter's personal information could alter that voter's record in the system.\n\nAnother computer security professional who reviewed the vulnerability \u2014 without attempting to probe it for fear of prosecution \u2014 is Kris Constable of PrivaSecTech in Vancouver, Canada. \"Anyone with security chops would have detected this problem,\" he said, \"so (the system) clearly has never been audited by any computer security professional.\"\n\nThe FBI declined to comment. A representative for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the agency had been notified, but it deferred to Georgia officials for details.\n\nCross said Wright, a businessman with \"some background in software,\" doesn't wish to speak publicly.\n\nThe Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff in the voting integrity lawsuit against Kemp, issued a statement decrying his outsourcing of the voter registration database and electronic poll book voter check-in system to a third party, PCC Technologies.\n\n\"There are still immediate steps that Secretary Kemp and the State Election Board can take to mitigate some, but not all, of the risk for Tuesday's vote,\" the group said.\n\nEfforts to reach PCC for comment have not been successful.\n\nThe drama played out on a day Kemp campaigned alongside President Donald Trump in Macon. Trump made no mention of the issue at the rally, and earlier, as he left the White House for Georgia, said he didn't know anything about it.\n\nThe finger-pointing is the latest turn in a campaign whose final weeks have been dominated by charges of voter suppression and countercharges of attempted voter fraud.\n\nIn the voting integrity case, a federal judge last month endorsed the plaintiff's arguments that Kemp has been derelict in his management of the state election system and that it violates voters' constitutional rights with its lack of verifiability and reliability.\n\nAbrams, who would be the nation's first black female governor, has called Kemp \"an architect of voter suppression\" and says he's used his current post to make it harder for certain voters to cast ballots. Kemp counters that he's following state and federal law and that it's Abrams and her affiliated voting advocacy groups trying to help people, including noncitizens, cast ballots illegally.\n\nThe atmosphere has left partisans and good-government advocates alike worrying about the possibility that the losing side will not accept Tuesday's results as legitimate.\n\nThe accusation is not the first from Kemp accusing outsiders of trying to penetrate his office. Immediately after the 2016 general election, Kemp declared that DHS tried to hack his office's network, an accusation dismissed as unfounded in mid-2017 by the DHS inspector general.\n\nEven before he was running for governor, Kemp faced criticism over Georgia's election system.\n\nGeorgia's centrally managed elections system lacks a verifiable paper trail that can be audited in case of problems. The state is one of just five nationwide that continues to rely exclusively on aged electronic voting machines that computer scientists have long criticized as untrustworthy because they are easily hacked and don't leave a paper trail.\n\nIn 2015, Kemp's office inadvertently released the Social Security numbers and other identifying information of millions of Georgia voters. His office blamed a clerical error.\n\nHis office made headlines again last year after security experts disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed until six months after it was first reported to election authorities. Personal data was again exposed for Georgia voters \u2014 6.7 million at the time \u2014 as were passwords used by county officials to access files.\n\nKemp's office blamed that breach on Kennesaw State University, which managed the system on Kemp's behalf.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Phil Bredesen, a popular moderate Democrat with an independent streak, and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a conservative Republican representing a largely rural district who has aligned herself wholeheartedly with President Donald Trump, running neck and neck in the race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker.\n\nIn an election cycle where many contests have been about Trump, this one has been squarely about the candidates. And Bredesen, a known quantity across the state \u2014 and a well-liked one among many Republicans and independents to boot \u2014 strongly benefits from that, according to experts.\n\n\"It's tight because Phil Bredesen is a singularly popular Democrat in this state. I think any other Democrat would be behind by 15 to 20 points,\" Anthony Nownes, a professor at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, told NBC News. \"Few voters associate Bredesen with the national Democratic Party, and he has worked hard to present himself to voters as a competent problem-solver rather than a partisan. He has bona fides because as governor he was very centrist.\"\n\nExperts and strategists who have watched the race say it shouldn't be this close. Trump won the state by 26 points in 2016 and remains popular among Tennesseans (56 percent of likely voters gave him a thumbs-up in a recent NBC/Marist poll). Blackburn has fully embraced him in her messaging and at her rallies.\n\nAt a Sunday night rally in Chattanooga \u2014 his third in Tennessee in recent weeks \u2014 Trump told the crowd, \"We have to get Senator Marsha Blackburn in office as soon as we can.\" Blackburn, in turn, thanked the crowd for sending Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to the White House and praised them for having \"had quite a 21 months.\"\n\nDespite that, Blackburn, 66, a 15-year veteran of Congress who appears frequently on Fox News, barely edged Bredesen in two recent polls, including the NBC/Marist poll on Tuesday, which had her beating him among likely voters 51 percent to 46 percent, within the margin of error. The Cook Political Report listed the race a toss-up.\n\n\"Bredesen has a history of attracting Republican and independent voters. People know he's a moderate to conservative Democrat, and they really like that about him,\" said Bruce Oppenheimer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. \"He's said he'll work with Trump when he thinks he's right and will oppose him when he thinks he's wrong.\"\n\n\"He's just not a polarizing figure, which is the opposite of Blackburn,\" Oppenheimer added.\n\nThe campaigns have reflected those perceptions, with issues like tariffs, health care and the opioid epidemic \u2014 which were prominent earlier in the race \u2014 taking a backseat down the home stretch.\n\n\"This race is distinctive because of the candidates ... and the tone of the campaigns has been very different,\u201d Tom Ingram, a Tennessee Republican strategist, told NBC News. \"Hers has been more akin to a base campaign or a district congressional campaign. It is a Fox (News)-based campaign.\"\n\n\"Bredesen's campaign is (about) what he is known for running. A not very partisan, tonally moderate and conciliatory and 'let's get things done' approach,\" Ingram added. \"He has walked the Trump line well and he has walked the nonpartisan line well.\"\n\nRep.

He also distanced himself from national Democrats, saying in September that he wouldn't support Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for majority leader if Democrats took back the Senate \u2014 countering attacks from Blackburn that he would act in lockstep with his party's leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, Blackburn has in recent weeks has echoed much of the president\u2019s harsh rhetoric on immigration, in what race-watchers have said is a bet that the border security issue will motivate Tennessee voters.\n\nTV ads have bombarded Tennessee voters, with outside groups spending millions.

Bredesen had raised more than $16 million and spent more than $15 million as of Oct. 17, according to FEC filings, while Blackburn had raised nearly $13 million and spent about $12 million.\n\nExperts expect that Blackburn will no doubt win over her base, but risks losing valuable moderate GOP and independent voters to Bredesen. As an example, many pointed to Corker's own lukewarm support of Blackburn. The departing Republican senator told CNN in April that while he would endorse her, Bredesen was \"my friend\" and that he was \"not going to campaign against him.\"\n\n\"Bredesen wants to make it about him, and has made it about him,\u201d said Josh Clinton, a political science at Vanderbilt University and a senior election analyst at NBC News. \"And because of that, he has a real shot.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 As Democratic pollster Peter Hart put it, maybe the best way to view our final national NBC News/WSJ poll of the 2018 election cycle is as a kaleidoscope.\n\n\u201cIt is a political kaleidoscope,\u201d said Hart, whose firm conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. \u201cYou turn the poll one way, and it looks [good for Democrats].\u201d But if you turn it another way, he adds, \u201cyou can see how the GOP squeaks through.\u201d\n\nConsider:\n\nDemocrats lead nationally among likely voters by a larger margin (7 points) than among registered voters (6 points), suggesting they have the voting intensity on their side. But that 7-point margin among likely voters is down from 9 points in October;\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s job rating \u2014 46 percent among likely voters \u2014 is in the danger zone for a sitting president facing his first midterm, but it\u2019s also higher than it was earlier in his presidency;\n\n59 percent of registered voters say they want significant change in the direction Trump has been leading the country, but 68 percent say they\u2019re satisfied with the state of the economy;\n\nAnd Democrats have more enthusiasm (85 percent say they have a high level of interest in the midterms), but Republicans have nearly caught up here (82 percent).\n\nSo one set of numbers suggest that Democrats are in store for a big night; the other set of numbers indicate that it could be a better-than-expected performance for Republicans.\n\nAll things considered \u2014 when you look at Democratic advantages with independents, with women and more enthusiastic Latino and millennial voters \u2014 you probably have to give Democrats the advantage heading into tomorrow night\u2019s election, says McInturff, the GOP pollster.\n\n\u201cIt has closed. It is a more competitive race,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for Republicans, it feels slightly short of where you\u2019d want to be for a national election.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll find out tomorrow night.\n\nNBC/Marist polls show tight races in Florida and Missouri\n\nSpeaking of turning the political kaleidoscope, our final NBC/Marist polls of Florida and Missouri paint a rosier Senate outlook for Democrats than the conventional wisdom and map suggests.\n\nOne of us on the slight lead for Dems in Florida: \u201cAt the top of the ticket, Democrat Andrew Gillum is up among likely voters against Republican Ron DeSantis, 50 percent to 46 percent, within the poll\u2019s margin of error. That\u2019s a similar margin to the five-point lead NBC News and Marist found in September, when Gillum led 48 percent to 43 percent... The margin is identical for Democrats in the closely watched Senate contest between incumbent Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson and outgoing GOP Gov. Rick Scott. Nelson leads Scott 50 percent to 46 percent among likely voters. Among the larger pool of all registered voters, Nelson leads 50 percent to 45 percent.\u201d\n\nAnd another of us on the margin-of-error contest in Missouri: \u201cMcCaskill, the state\u2019s incumbent senator, gets support from 50 percent of likely voters in a head-to-head matchup, while Hawley, the state\u2019s attorney general, gets 47 percent. Just 3 percent of likely voters say they\u2019re undecided. In September\u2019s NBC/Marist poll of the state, McCaskill and Hawley were tied at 47 percent each. When the ballot expands to include the Libertarian and Green Party candidates, McCaskill\u2019s lead remains at 3 points, 47 percent to 44 percent. The results are all within the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus-minus 5.2 percentage points. Other recent polls of Missouri show the race tied.\u201d\n\nTwo different polls and two different likely-voter models\n\nSo our two NBC polls paint two slightly different pictures here at the end \u2014 the national NBC/WSJ shows a closer horserace than a month ago (though the difference is within the margin of error), and the state NBC/Marist polls of Florida and Missouri have Democrats ahead (though within the margin of error)\n\nSo how do you explain the contradiction \u2014 outside of the margin of error?\n\nWell, the polls are different, with different likely-voter models. The national NBC/WSJ poll is taken from a voter-file list, and likely voters are determined by past participation and/or current interest. The Marist polls, meanwhile, are taken from random-digit-dialing, and likely voters are determined by a probability model\n\nBy and large, the NBC/WSJ poll is a more cautious poll, while Marist might be capturing more new voters. Which better shows the current direction and momentum? We don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re glad we have these (different) products, because there\u2019s no perfect way to do this, especially in an environment where turnout will be unprecedented.\n\nMore from the NBC/Marist poll of Florida\n\nRick Scott popularity dips: Our NBC/Marist poll of Florida also finds this: \u201cGillum\u2019s favorability stands at 48 percent favorable/40 percent unfavorable among likely voters. For his GOP rival, DeSantis, 43 percent of likely voters have a favorable impression of him, while 45 percent disagree.\u201d\n\n\u201cNelson, who has served in the Senate since 2000, gets a favorable rating from 45 percent of likely voters, with 42 percent giving him a thumbs down. That\u2019s compared with rival Scott\u2019s 42 percent favorable/50 percent unfavorability. That net negative rating of -8 percent for Scott is a drop from a net positive rating of +1 percent in September.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking: If the dip in Scott\u2019s popularity is real, is it because he\u2019s embraced being with Trump in the final days? Remember, he had been keeping his distance for most of this 2018 season\u2026\n\nIf Scott loses, we will look back on the last 10 days and ask: Why did he forego all the effort to distance himself from Trump and party to campaign with Trump twice in the last 10 days?\n\nWill 2018 be 2016 all over again? Or will it be more like Virginia and the special elections of 2017-2018?\n\nDespite a rough overall political environment for the GOP, we still have detected quiet confidence from Republican strategists and pollsters. And if you experienced 2016, it\u2019s hard not be confident that 2018 could be 2016 all over again \u2014 or close to it.\n\nBut also don\u2019t forget what happened in Virginia and Alabama in 2017, or the special elections of 2017-2018.\n\nTrump hits three rallies on last day of campaigning\n\nPresident Trump holds rallies today in Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45 pm ET, in Fort Wayne, Ind., at 6:05 pm ET, and in Cape Girardeau, Mo. at 10:00 pm ET\n\nWithout evidence, Kemp accuses Georgia Democrats of attempted hacking\n\n\u201cGeorgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, said Sunday that he was investigating the state Democratic Party for an attempted hack of the voter registration system \u2014 a claim met with a swift response from Democrats charging him with a shameless \"political stunt\" two days before Election Day,\u201d per NBC News.\n\n\u201cKemp, who is in a neck-and-neck race with Stacey Abrams, alleged that the state Democratic Party made a \u2018failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system\u2019 and announced that his office was opening an investigation into the party. Kemp said his office alerted the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, but he offered no evidence to back up his allegation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of the inherent conflicts of interest when a sitting secretary of state \u2014 heading up elections in a state \u2014 runs for higher office in that same state\u2026", "By Agnes Constante\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Congressional candidate Gina Ortiz Jones was deployed in Iraq when her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer.

But despite making up 1 percent of the U.S. population and the community's centuries-long history in the U.S., the group's representation in Congress has been sparse.\n\nPrior to Scott, Congress saw at least one other voting member of Filipino descent in former Republican Rep. Steve Austria from Ohio, according to Krystal Ka'ai, executive director of CAPAC. Former Republican Sen. John Ensign from Nevada also claimed Filipino heritage, though he is not documented by the U.S. Congress\u2019 Office of the Historian as having AAPI ancestry, Ka'ai added.\n\nRep.

Authors of the study also wrote that some survey respondents suggested that the community may prioritize spending money on their families in the United States and overseas as opposed to politics.\n\nImmigrants in general, especially low-income immigrants, can also face a lack of knowledge of how the U.S. government works, financial networks and financial stability \u2013 all of which are necessary when running for office, according to Sayu Bhojwani, founder and president of New American Leaders, an organization that works to get immigrants and underrepresented Americans into politics.\n\nBut while the community hasn't historically been elected to office or donated to campaigns, it is active in other ways, Lien noted.\n\nThe August study found that Filipino Americans primarily participate in politics by voting. According to research firm AAPI Data, 59 percent of Filipinos were registered to vote and 50 percent of them voted in the 2016 election, ranking third among other Asian-American groups.\n\nApart from voting, Lien said Filipino Americans' strength tends to be in labor-based activism dating back to the '60s, the decade when Filipino labor leaders joined forces with Mexican farmworkers in the Delano Grape Strike to protest poor wages and working conditions.\n\n\u201cI think \u2026 this is a group that has been neglected, and this is actually a group that has a lot of potential,\u201d Lien said. \u201cThey could do a lot more in terms of visibility in mainstream politics, but you need some role models, you need some cases of success.\u201d\n\nThe Candidates\n\nThe five Filipino-Americans Congressional candidates running this election all said they were motivated to step into the political sphere to create change and give back to their respective communities. They also believe the range of their experiences, including as immigrants or members of immigrant families, will allow them to better serve their districts.\n\nCox, a Democrat hoping to win a seat in California's 21st Congressional District, said he drew on experiences including being called racial slurs as a student. \u201cYou get called that on a bus when you\u2019re 6 years old, you remember that for the rest of your life,\u201d he said, referring to anti-Asian slurs. \u201cIt makes you want to stand up to bullies.\u201d\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate TJ Cox speaks at a 2018 mid-term elections rally on Oct. 4, 2018 in Fullerton, California.

What we don\u2019t know, really, is how someone in the privacy of their polling booth or in their home, they can always change their mind at the last minute.\u201d\n\nArnel Dino, chair of the Filipino American Democratic Caucus of the California Democratic Party, said he believes the election of any of the five candidates into Congress would spark greater interest in politics in the community and would give members a direct voice in the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of allies nationally and within different communities, Democrat and Republican.

Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.\n\nMahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital's emergency department March 1, said he didn't see evil in Bowers' eyes but \"a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.\" He said he couldn't go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him \"for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.\"\n\nHe noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who \"instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.\"\n\nMahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism \"a lot\" as a kid, said he acted out of love.\n\n\"Love. That's why I did it,\" he said. \"Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we're all here. ...

That\u2019s a similar margin to the five-point lead NBC News and Marist found in September, when Gillum led 48 percent to 43 percent.\n\nAmong all registered voters, Gillum\u2019s lead increases slightly to five points, 50 percent to 45 percent.\n\nThe margin is identical for Democrats in the closely watched Senate contest between incumbent Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson and outgoing GOP Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nNelson leads Scott 50 percent to 46 percent among likely voters. Among the larger pool of all registered voters, Nelson leads 50 percent to 45 percent.\n\nIn September, Nelson got 48 percent support to Scott\u2019s 45 percent among likely voters.\n\nBoth Democratic candidates also enjoy net-positive favorability ratings, while both Republicans are more disliked than liked.\n\nGillum\u2019s favorability stands at 48 percent favorable/40 percent unfavorable among likely voters. For his GOP rival, DeSantis, 43 percent of likely voters have a favorable impression of him, while 45 percent disagree.\n\nNelson, who has served in the Senate since 2000, gets a favorable rating from 45 percent of likely voters, with 42 percent giving him a thumbs down. That\u2019s compared with rival Scott\u2019s 42 percent favorable/50 percent unfavorable rating. That net negative rating of -8 percent for Scott is a drop from a net positive rating of +1 percent in September.\n\nAsked which party they want in control of Congress after November\u2019s elections, 49 percent of likely voters choose Democrats, while 45 percent choose Republicans.\n\nThe positive news for Democrats comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s job approval rating in the state is upside-down, with 44 percent of likely voters approving and 51 percent disapproving. That\u2019s down from September, which put Trump\u2019s approval rating in the state at 46 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove among likely voters.\n\nTrump has not shied away from urging Florida voters to vote for both Scott and DeSantis, stopping five times in the state this midterm cycle for Make America Great Again campaign rallies.\n\nDemocrats win with independents, minorities; GOP leads with whites\n\nDemocrats in both races are performing better than their Republican counterparts with likely voters who are independents, minorities and women.\n\nGillum leads DeSantis with likely voters who are independents (57 percent to 37 percent), African-Americans (91 percent to 7 percent), Latinos (51 percent to 44 percent) and women ( 58 percent to 40 percent). DeSantis leads with white voters (56 percent to 41 percent), men (54 percent to 42 percent) and seniors (52 percent to 46 percent).\n\nSimilarly, Nelson leads Scott with independents (55 percent to 37 percent), African-Americans (82 percent to 8 percent), Latinos (56 percent to 41) and women (56 percent to 39 percent). Scott is ahead with white likely voters (56 percent to 42 percent), men (54 percent to 43 percent), and seniors (51 percent to 47 percent).\n\nScott, who worked to woo Latino voters during both his tenure as governor and his Senate campaign, does not seem to have built significant goodwill statewide among a group that makes up 15 percent of the likely voter sample in the poll.\n\nScott\u2019s favorability rating among Latinos is 39 percent favorable, 49 percent unfavorable. That\u2019s a more negative net rating than the 42 percent favorable, 45 percent unfavorable rating that Latinos give DeSantis, Scott\u2019s fellow Republican.\n\nVoter enthusiasm high for both parties\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats express a high level of enthusiasm for voting. Among both Democratic and Republican registered voters, 82 percent say the midterm election is very important.\n\nThat\u2019s a level of intensity that has been reflected in early voting in the Sunshine State. More than 4.3 million ballots have already been cast in Florida via early or absentee ballots, more than any other state in the country, according to data provided by TargetSmart.\n\nIn the poll\u2019s sample, 45 percent of likely voters said that they have already voted.\n\nOf that 45 percent, 54 percent said they had voted for Gillum compared with 46 percent for DeSantis.

It did not say when the shootout took place or explain how it had determined that the perpetrators of Friday's attack were among the 19 killed.\n\nThe ministry published photographs purporting to show the bodies of the slain militants, as well as rifles, shotguns and pistols.

Dave Brat against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA undercover operative and first-time candidate. Brat, who ousted House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary upset by using anti-immigration attacks, was an early adopter of the brand of identity politics that now define the GOP in the Trump era.\n\nSpanberger, who began her career as a federal law enforcement officer working narcotics and money laundering cases, is emphasizing her national security credentials and vowing to focus on health care and prescription drug costs, student loan debt and modern infrastructure.\n\nShe may also become part of a \u201cpink wave\u201d of women who have laced up their running shoes after President Donald Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, as we saw some of the rhetoric increase and we saw the division in our community, the divides, for me it was an incredibly motivating time because there are so many challenges facing our country,\u201d Spanberger told supporters at a luncheon last Thursday in Louisa, northwest of Richmond.\n\nThe race is seen as a bellwether for whether college-educated suburban voters \u2014 especially \u201cPanera moms\u201d who traditionally vote Republican \u2014 will repudiate Trump and his brand of politics by voting Democratic or staying home.\n\nDavid Wasserman, House race analyst for the Cook Political Report, says it will be among the first races he\u2019ll be watching on election night, with polls closing in the state at 7 p.m. EST.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good early test of how far the \u2018suburban revolt\u2019 will take Democrats,\u201d said Wasserman.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who campaigned with Spanberger this week, told NBC News: \u201cI want a wave of compassion and decency in this country. If there's going to be that kind of wave, the people all over the country and the world want to see, I think Virginia will be the start of it.\u201d\n\nThree forces need to converge to push Spanberger over the finish line, said Quentin Kidd, dean of Christopher Newport University's College of Social Sciences in Virginia.\n\nThe first is Democratic women who\u2019ve been organizing for two years. \u201cI give them credit for putting this race where it is,\u201d said Kidd, referring to the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County, which began organizing two days after the 2016 election.\n\nThe second is Brat\u2019s personal profile. \u201cHe\u2019s operated really like Trump has. He cares only about his base,\u201d said Kidd.\n\nAnd finally, there are the \u201cCantor Republicans,\u201d especially women in suburban Richmond who voted for Brat\u2019s predecessor and are now turned off by Trump. \u201cThey are pushing this to being a tied race,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Woman Factor\n\nA poll released last Monday by Christopher Newport University showed the race statistically tied, with 46 percent of likely voters favoring Spanberger and 45 percent supporting Brat. That\u2019s a significant shift from two years ago, when Brat beat Democrat Eileen Bedell by 15 points.\n\nThe poll found a gender gap in the 7th, comparable to other districts across the country, with men favoring Brat by 13 points, and Spanberger leading among women by 16 points.\n\nIn interviews, longtime Republican voters said Trump\u2019s focus on culturally divisive issues is driving them further from the party.\n\n\u201cI would feel a greater sense of loyalty to the Republican Party if anyone would break ranks and have the strength of character to say \u2018I really will not tolerate this in our country,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Vogt, a Republican who worked in the George H.W. Bush administration.\n\nAnd some GOP men planning to support Spanberger also cited cultural division as well as national security concerns for their decision. Mike Walworth, who previously supported Brat, said GOP attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia was \u201cthe first straw.\u201d Said Walworth, \u201cIt is a national tragedy what they are trying to do to Bob Mueller.\u201d\n\nDemocratic enthusiasm and activism is adding to the mix.\n\nTwo days after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump, Kim Wright, 47, a stay-at-home mother of three, founded the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County in a once-reliable Republican stronghold that is now an epicenter for potential swing votes.\n\n\u201cThe election happened and it became a full-time job for me to be dealing with all of this,\u201d she said. The group now has more than 3,600 members who have been instrumental in organizing grassroots actions including canvassing and organizing candidate forums.\n\nThe group\u2019s first target was the 2017 gubernatorial election. Trump carried Chesterfield, a traditionally Republican neighborhood, by about 4,000 votes in 2016. But Gov. Ralph Northam carried it last year, the first time a Democrat did so since 1961.\n\n\u201cTrump is the original sin. That\u2019s who got these women energized and mobilized in the beginning,\" Kidd said. \"Those women started this. Trump ultimately is the headwind for Brat.\"\n\nWright\u2019s members have been so disciplined about showing up at Brat\u2019s public events that he just stopped doing them, according to Kidd. \u201cThe women are in my grill no matter where I go,\u201d Brat lamented in January 2017 \u2014 an observation that may foreshadow his fate on Tuesday.\n\nBrat as a Candidate\n\nMore than many other GOP incumbents, Brat is a reflection of Trump\u2019s politics. He emphasizes border security, crime, the military and protecting gun laws in his platform.\n\nOn Oct. 18, Trump issued an endorsement on Twitter, saying Brat \u201cis a powerful vote for MAGA and loves the Great State of Virginia.

While for now not threatening to resume higher enrichment, Iranian officials in recent months have made a point to threaten that could resume at any time faster than before.\n\nThe new American sanctions particularly hurt Iran's vital oil industry, a crucial source of hard currency for its anemic economy. Its national currency has plummeted over the last year, sending prices for everything from mobile phones to medicine skyrocketing.\n\n\"Today, Iran is able to sell its oil and it will sell,\" Rouhani vowed Monday as the sanctions kicked in.\n\nIranian state television aired footage of air defense systems and anti-aircraft batteries in two-day military maneuvers underway across a vast stretch of the country's north. It included surface-to-air missiles shooting down a drone.\n\nThe drill was to continue through Tuesday. Iranian army Gen. Habibillah Sayyari said both the national army and the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard were taking part in the exercise.\n\nRouhani, meanwhile, pledged to government officials in comments aired on state TV that Iran would overcome the sanctions.\n\n\"We are in the war situation, \" Rouhani said. \"We are in the economic war situation.

There is no difference. We must resist and win,\" he said.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its national currency, the rial, now trades at 145,000 to one U.S. dollar, down from when it traded 40,500 to $1 a year ago. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year which resulted in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. Sporadic demonstrations still continue.\n\nRouhani separately said leaders from \"four powers\" met with Iran on the sidelines of the September meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to try to save the deal, including brokering a possible meeting with Trump.
