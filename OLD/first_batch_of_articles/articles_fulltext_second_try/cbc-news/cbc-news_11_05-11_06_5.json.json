["The first real scandal of Doug Ford's new government broke with a terse news release that did not come close to revealing the full story.\n\n\"The Honourable Jim Wilson has resigned as Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation, and Trade, effective immediately,\" said a statement from Ford's director of media relations, emailed after 6 p.m. last Friday. \"Mr. Wilson will also be resigning from the Progressive Conservative caucus to seek treatment for addiction issues.\"\n\nThe statement raised more questions than it answered.\n\nWhy would Wilson have to resign from caucus to deal with a health issue? It's understandable that a minister going into rehab would step down from cabinet. But leaving the PC caucus is another matter entirely. Wilson did not quit being an MPP, yet he gave up his political affiliation with a party he'd served for 28 years. It raised the question: why was Ford washing his hands of Wilson?\n\nAnd what triggered Wilson's need to seek treatment? Numerous people at high levels in the PC party tell CBC that Wilson has struggled with alcohol for many years. He had appeared at an event with Ford only hours earlier. That suggested some sort of incident must have occurred. But Ford's office refused to say anything more.\n\n'Like they are trying to cover something up'\n\nThis is what Ford did not reveal: Wilson's resignation was triggered when \u2014 according to three PC Party sources \u2014 a staffer made an allegation against Wilson of sexually inappropriate behaviour. CBC News has not confirmed whether the allegation is true and has been unable to reach Wilson for comment.\n\nFord's office has still not acknowledged that a complaint was made against Wilson, or that an investigation has begun, even though cabinet minister Lisa MacLeod told reporters this on Monday. She did not provide any details on the nature of the complaint.\n\nDavid Scott, vice-president of Toronto's Broad Reach Communications, says the Ford government has extended the controversy by withholding information.\n\nThe PCs extended the life of the controversy by failing to reveal immediately that an allegation had been made against Wilson, said David Scott, vice-president of Broad Reach Communications, a Toronto firm specializing in public relations and crisis communications.\n\n\"That's a big critical piece of information that they chose to not share,\" Scott said in an interview. \"From a communications point of view, they're making the issue worse. They look like they are trying to cover something up and they aren't being very respectful of the voters who put them in power.\"\n\nScott described the Ford government's approach to crisis communications as \"completely amateurish\" for leaving key questions unanswered when announcing Wilson's resignation. He said Wilson's departure from caucus \"signalled there's a bigger story here, and that led to a lot more media attention.\"\n\nFord's spokespeople are not providing any more official information about the reasons for Wilson's departure, saying that their initial statement stands.\n\n\"Every action we've taken has been to protect the identity of any complainants who might have come forward,\" said an official in the premier's office, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nNDP deputy leader Sara Singh says it's 'time for Mr. Ford to come out of hiding and answer questions' about Wilson. (Mike Crawley/CBC)\n\nBut announcing that Wilson was facing an allegation would not require revealing the identity of the complainant, Scott said.\n\nHe said the Ford government should have been up front that an allegation has been made, \"demonstrating that they're taking appropriate action and demonstrating to the potential victims that they're taking these complaints seriously.\"\n\n'The public deserves to know'\n\nGovernments and organizations are foolish to think they can control the message in a PR crisis by not talking to the media, said Scott.\n\n\"When an elected official at a cabinet level has these kinds of allegations made at them, and actions being taken by the government, the public deserves to know,\" he said. \"It's a very important principle and it's one that I hope the government will learn from and not make the same mistake again.\"\n\nNDP deputy leader Sara Singh said Ford's initial statement about Wilson \"tried to cover up\" the allegation against him.\n\n\"Mr. Ford didn't tell Ontarians the truth about the departure of his most senior minister, and that's wrong,\" Singh said in a statement Tuesday. \"It's time for Mr. Ford to come out of hiding and answer questions.\"\n\nFord is scheduled to take questions from reporters at an event in Trenton on Wednesday morning.\n\nWilson was Ford's most experienced minister, having served in the cabinets of both Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. (CBC)\n\nThis is not the first time Ford orchestrated the departure of a PC MPP while failing to reveal the whole story.\n\nIn April, less than a month after Ford won the party leadership, Kitchener\u2013Conestoga MPP Michael Harris announced that he was leaving politics to deal with a degenerative eye disease.\n\nFord did not contradict Harris for two days. Suddenly, after reporters began asking questions, the party announced that Harris was expelled from the PC caucus.\n\nThe party said the reason Harris had been booted was that he had sent text messages of a sexual nature to a former intern. What the party did not say was that the sexting incident had happened several years before and had already been investigated. Harris publicly apologized for his actions, but he was off Ford's slate of candidates. Harris has since been elected to Waterloo region council.\n\nKathleen Wynne and #MeToo\n\nKathleen Wynne had her own #MeToo scandals, even before the hashtag was coined.\n\nIn response to questions from CBC News in May 2016, Wynne revealed that sexual harassment allegations had been made against two Liberal MPPs during her time as premier. Initially, Wynne declined to name the MPPs or offer any further details, saying she wanted to protect the identity of the complainants.\n\n\"The people who brought complaints forward were not looking for a public process, they were looking for a confidential process. So I'm not at liberty to talk about those situations,\" Wynne said at the time.\n\nFour days later, Wynne revealed that one of the MPPs was Kim Craitor, who resigned as the member for Niagara Falls in 2013. He denied any wrongdoing. Wynne has never identified the other MPP.", "The 2016 U.S. election may be the most famous instance of bots being used to sway public opinion on a vote, but it looks like savvy programmers were also attempting to change perceptions of Calgary's Olympic bid.\n\nCity council's Olympic assessment committee heard Tuesday that nearly half the responses to an online poll on whether Calgary should bid to host the 2026 Winter Games had to be scrubbed from the results due to \"bot activity.\"\n\nThe public engagement team told council that 6,000 responses, 46 per cent, had to be deleted due to bot activity.\n\n7700 respondents. (46% of online respondents were scrapped as bots) <a href=\"https://t.co/m82cuTZooS\">pic.twitter.com/m82cuTZooS</a> \u2014@CBCScott\n\nThe majority of the scrubbed comments were in favour of a bid, the consultants said.\n\nVoting bots are automated software programs that imitate human voters in online polls or surveys. The tools can be deployed en masse to input multiple responses to online forms if there aren't precautionary security measures like CAPTCHA codes in place.\n\nThe bot activity peaked on Oct. 26, close to the end of the engagement sessions. The city's public engagement initiatives ran from Oct. 2 to 28, both in town halls around the city and online. More than 7,700 people weighed in online.\n\nBots were identified by replies coming from the same IP addresses, that used similar or duplicated language and had close time stamps, the city said.\n\nThe team reviewed responses manually to look for deliberate misuse patterns, the report said, since there are some legitimate reasons for responses to come from the same IP address \u2014 such as multiple people using a library or office computer.\n\n42 per cent polled strongly against bid\n\nOf the responses that were determined to be by actual Calgarians, not bots, 42 per cent were strongly against a bid and 21 per cent were strongly in favour.\n\nCalgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said if the bid moves forward after the public plebiscite, the information gathered during the public engagement can be used to improve the bid process. But he's not concerned that the majority of those polled were against.\n\n\"I think it's difficult to draw conclusions of how the public feels in total based on that report because it really wasn't its intent,\" Nenshi told media following the assessment committee meeting.\n\nOnline engagement 'can be problematic'\n\nOnline polls have come under increased scrutiny as vote-bots have become so increasingly available that there are even free scripts posted online to help people maliciously affect the results of unsecure votes. But, the city said it's doing its best to stay on top of the technology and guard against automated vote manipulation.\n\nNenshi said the city is always looking to find better ways of doing engagement, as in-person open houses can also present challenges for parents and those who work in the evenings. But, he said the bots are concerning.\n\n\"We're finding the online engagement can be problematic as well,\" he said.\n\nThe 90-page report on what the city heard during its public engagement sessions is available on the city's website.\n\nAdvance voting on the non-binding plebiscite on whether or not the city should proceed with a bid for the Games is already underway, with final voting day on Nov. 13.\n\nLIVE EVENT: CBC Calgary Olympic Games Plebiscite Town Hall If you live in Calgary, find out what you need to know before you cast your vote in the Nov. 13 plebiscite by tuning in to the CBC Calgary Olympic Games Plebiscite Town Hall.

They will also likely use their new majority to reverse what they see as a hands-off approach by Republicans toward Trump's foreign policy, and push for tougher dealings with Russia, Saudi Arabia and North Korea.\n\nHowever, any attempt to impeach Trump is likely to run headlong into resistance in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe Democrats also could force Trump to scale back his legislative ambitions, possibly dooming his promises to fund a border wall with Mexico, pass a second major tax-cut package, or carry out his hard-line policies on trade.\n\nPresident reacts\n\nTrump said the midterm results \"defied history,\" during a speech at the White House at midday Wednesday. He took credit for the Republican gain in the Senate and for minimizing losses in the House. He also called out Republican candidates who lost, for not asking for his \"embrace\" during the campaign.\n\nTrump also said he hopes to work with Democrats on issues such as infrastructure building and drug prices.\n\n\"It really could be a beautiful bipartisan situation,\" he said.\n\nHowever, ahead of Tuesday's vote, Trump made only passing reference to his $1.5 trillion-tax cut \u2014 the Republican Congress's signature achievement \u2014 and instead barnstormed through mostly white regions of the country with dark and foreboding warnings. He predicted an \"invasion\" from the migrant caravan making its way toward the U.S. and decried the \"radical\" agenda of speaker-in-waiting Pelosi.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Trump called to congratulate the California lawmaker and acknowledged her plea for bipartisanship, according to her spokesperson.\n\nPelosi is likely to face a challenge for the speakership from newer or younger members later this month. And the Democrats could see a struggle inside the party over how aggressively to confront the Trump administration.\n\nDuring the campaign, Pelosi urged candidates to focus on lowering health-care costs and creating jobs with infrastructure investment, and she tamped down calls for impeachment.\n\nLosing the House will test Trump's ability to compromise, something he has shown little interest in over the last two years with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress. There may, however, be some room to work with Democrats on issues with bipartisan support such as an infrastructure improvement package or protections against prescription drug price increases.\n\nA congressional win by Democrat Ilhan Omar, centre, was just one of several historic results from Tuesday's midterm elections. (Eric Miller/Reuters)\n\nIn locking down a majority, Democratic candidates flipped seats in several suburban districts outside Washington, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago, Denver and Dallas that were considered prime targets for turnover because they were won by Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Democrats made only slight inroads in Trump country, where they tried to win back white working-class voters.\n\nMidterm elections are typically difficult for the party in power, but the Republicans' hold on power was further weakened by an unusually large number of retirements, as well as infighting between conservatives and centrists over their allegiance to Trump.\n\nThe Democrats, in turn, benefited from extraordinary voter enthusiasm, robust fundraising and unusually fresh candidates. More women than ever were running, along with veterans and minorities, many of them motivated by revulsion over Trump.\n\nAt 29, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.

She bounced the baby on her lap as the dapper cabinet minister and his staff made their way around the Parkdale Food Centre food bank.\n\nDuclos then stood at a podium to share his government's plans to enshrine into law targets to reduce the rate of poverty in Canada.\n\nThese targets would see poverty rates lowered 20 per cent from 2015 levels by 2020 and 50 per cent by 2030.\n\nThe law will also establish the country's first official poverty line using the \"market basket measure,\" which tests whether a family's income will mean they can afford a set of basic goods and services \u2014 something advocacy groups had pushed for in public consultations leading up to this law that has been two years in the making.\n\nIt also proposes to create a national advisory council on poverty, which would provide advice to the minister and include a dedicated adviser on children's issues and an annual public report on progress made toward the poverty-reduction targets.\n\n\"Our vision for Canada is to become a world leader in the eradication of poverty, a vision for a Canada without poverty,\" Duclos said.\n\n\"We understand that the road to achieving this ambitious goal will be a long one, and we have a lot of work to do to get there.\"\n\nBut the new law does not include any new spending for programs meant to help Canada's poor today.\n\nTangible progress requires money\n\nDuclos acknowledged this but pointed to previously announced investments totalling $22 billion since 2015 for low-income families and the middle class. He also hinted that more could be coming in the 2019 budget.\n\nThe proposed legislation comes in advance of another promised bill to enshrine the Liberals' national housing strategy in law.

Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., in July. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nHeitkamp is trailing in the polls behind Kevin Cramer, a Republican.\n\nBut North Dakota voters are notoriously unpredictable, said Mark Jendrysik, professor of political science and public administration at the University of North Dakota. Heitkamp remains well-liked by the electorate, he said.\n\nThe state only has one representative in the House and Jendrysik said voters will likely support the Republican running, Kelly Armstrong, over Democrat Mac Schneider.\n\n\"That race really hasn't been polled but one would presume the Republican candidate has the advantage. He's raised substantially more money,\" said Jendrysik.\n\nIf voters currently living in North Dakota see the 2018 midterms as a referendum on Trump, then Republicans may have a leg up. The president remains popular in the state that butts up against the southern borders of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Jendrysik said.\n\n\"Many conservatives in North Dakota ignore, I think, his more extreme statements.

I'm the victim, why is it me that's paying the price?'\n\n\"But the way our current system is set up, removing the victim from access is the fastest way to keep them safe.\"\n\nMental health supports for women looking to rebuild their lives must be also be improved, Lim said. Escaping a toxic relationship is a long, wrenching process and many women, already isolated by their abusers, are doing it alone.\n\n\"[The supports] are very few and far between,\" Lim said. \"We do have them here in the city but often access to them comes at the end of a very long wait list.\n\n\"It's phenomenal to me how many times you speak to a woman and they've never accessed counselling services or mental health support.\"\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint how many abusers re-offend while released on bail as the numbers aren't currently tracked, but Lim is involved in a local campaign to change that.\n\nSeveral front-line agencies in Edmonton are working to develop a new reporting system which would create a detailed database of domestic abuse incidents in Edmonton \u2014 a system which would track repeat offenders, their victims and the different kinds of abuse perpetrated, Lim said.\n\nThe project is still in its infancy, but Lim hopes it will change the we think about domestic abuse.\n\n\"I think it heightens our level of awareness of the impact of domestic violence on our city.\"", "Moments after he was convicted of first-degree murder, Glenn Randall's heartbroken sister \u2014 who testified against him \u2014 wept in his arms as the sheriff allowed a final hug before he was taken to prison to begin serving a life sentence.\n\nRandall, who lived in Strathmore, Alta., fatally shot his ex-girlfriend Brenda Walker in the head in January 2015.\n\nThe jury, which had been deliberating since Monday, found Randall guilty of first-degree murder Tuesday morning. He testified that he loved Brenda and never wanted her dead.\n\n\"It's hard to get into somebody's mind to try and understand why they would so something so awful to somebody they professed to love,\" said prosecutor Lori Chambers.\n\nDuring the trial, jurors heard that on Jan. 6, 2015, after he walked over to Walker's home and drunkenly shot her in the head. Randall got in his truck and called his two sisters in New Brunswick to confess.\n\nWendy Baxter was called by the prosecution to testify against her brother two weeks ago. She wept as she told the story of the early morning phone call she received from her intoxicated brother. Baxter begged her brother to turn himself in.\n\nBoth of Randall's sisters testified their brother was a loving man who had never exhibited any signs of violence.\n\n\"They were nothing but gracious throughout the proceedings,\" Chambers said of the sisters. \"I can't even imagine how difficult it was to be in the position that they were in.\"\n\nBaxter was allowed to hug her brother in the courtroom before he was taken away by sheriffs. She sobbed in his arms and he kissed the top of her head before he was led away.\n\nProsecutors Lori Chambers and Jim Sawa ran the trial against Glenn Randall. \"I'd like to think that even Mr. Randall, if he could go back in time, would change things,\" said Chambers. (Meghan Grant/CBC)\n\nRandall has always admitted to killing Walker but his lawyers argued he should be found guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter.\n\nDefence lawyers Jennifer Ruttan and Michael Bates argued their client was too drunk to form the intent necessary to commit first-degree murder.\n\nRandall and Walker broke up in late December 2014 because she felt he was too close with his former girlfriend.\n\nProsecutors Jim Sawa and Lori Chambers suggested to jurors that Randall's text messages to Walker the night she was killed show he became increasingly angry with her.\n\nAfter midnight, Randall walked down the block to Walker's home.\n\nWhen he arrived, armed with a loaded gun, she called 911, telling the operator that she feared for her life.\n\nOn the 911 call, Randall can be heard saying, \"I love you, I'm sorry,\" before the gun is fired.\n\nBrenda 'campaigned for the underdog'\n\nSeveral of Walker's friends wrote victim impact statements describing a woman with a big heart who \"didn't have a mean bone in her body\" and who always \"campaigned for the underdog.\"\n\nWalker left behind a son, who she loved \"to the moon and back,\" according to her best friend of 20 years, Carla Fabian.\n\nJustice Earl Wilson told Walkers' loved ones \"their pain is not forgotten or overlooked.\"\n\nRandall offered an apology right before he was sentenced by Wilson to life in prison.\n\n\"I'm so very sorry this happened,\" said Randall. \"Although Brenda is gone, she will continue to live in my heart forever.\"", "A former Newfoundland and Labrador premier \u2014 who also served as finance minister \u2014 told the Muskrat Falls public inquiry he did see a note from mid-level bureaucrats calling for the megaproject to be delayed, but he disagreed with that viewpoint.\n\nTom Marshall, who was the finance minister when the project was sanctioned in December 2012, also served as premier for less than a year, from January to September 2014.\n\nHe said there was pressure to provide the public with reliable power.\n\n\"This all started with us being told there was a need for power.

Called Trump and the Media, it's taught by visiting professor Sam Tanenhaus, a former New York Times Sunday Book Review editor, historian and journalist.\n\nHe says the course is sometimes called Trump in Real Time, and after witnessing his lecture it really is the best description for it. The syllabus is driven every week by Donald Trump and the \"hurricane that surrounds him,\" Tanenhaus says.\n\nClass discussion is motivated by questions about what's happening in the Trump administration and the news it generates.\n\nTanenhaus' energetic nature gets the students engaged and talking for almost two hours. They debate, share opinion, and speak about what they've read, watched or heard. The thoughts and opinions on issues like the midterms are quite varied, but what's different about this discussion is that it's respectful.\n\nTanenhaus says that as an older person who grew up in a different social climate and era, the opportunity to lead a classroom filled with 180 young people from all over the world \u2014 most of whom are women \u2014 and to hear them talk about their perspective on what they see in the news has been one of the most valuable experiences he has had.\n\nThe students must like it too \u2014 every week he teaches to a packed room.

(Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)\n\nThe military is also having a problem keeping skilled trades interested in a regimented life, with 102 different occupations marked as below strength. There are particular shortages of pilots and engineers.\n\n\"As an outward-looking nation, Britain has always counted on the dedicated service of our friends from the Commonwealth to keep this country safe,\" Mark Lancaster, the junior defence minister, told parliament. \"Their different perspectives will also help us to enhance our cultural understanding, giving us an operational advantage over our adversaries.\"\n\nThere are already around 4,500 Commonwealth citizens serving in the British military. Non-resident recruiting was banned in 2013, then allowed but capped at 200 people a year in 2016. (Nepalese Gurkhas and Irish citizens were still able to join under special rules.)\n\nThe limits were put into place as a result of austerity-driven cuts to the defence budget, which have seen the size of the British Army reduced by more than a fifth since 2011, and the Navy and Air Force each shed 5,000 members.\n\nThe pay freeze that came along with the cuts made an already tough career less attractive, and saw voluntary departures increase beyond expectations. (In September, U.K. armed forces members were awarded a two per cent pay hike, their largest raise in seven years.)\n\nRoyal Air Force engineers inspect a Eurofighter Typhoon.

The house is a two-unit dwelling.\n\nIn a news release on Monday, \u200bOshawa Fire Services did not name the charges or the five people charged.\n\nThe fire department, however, did say the two tenants who have been charged lived in the lower levels of the property at the time of the fire.\n\nWitnesses said the fire spread rapidly, consuming the rear of the house. The fire began on the main floor but the cause has not been released. (Viewer video)\n\nWood said the fire, which killed two adults and two children, is a good reminder that working smoke alarms can save lives.\n\nThe house had no working smoke alarms.\n\n\"Well, I know that morning our response was quick. It is just around the corner from our headquarters hall. And in this case, working smoke alarms would have alerted the people of the house that something was going on and they would have been able to get out safely,\" he said.\n\n\"And our crews just would have went in and knocked down the fire. What we learned from this fire, and pretty much every fire, is that fire grows quickly and you don't have a lot of time to get out.

The two reports have been given to Oshawa Fire Services.\n\n\"Because of the contents and the way fire has changed, with things burning quicker and hotter, working smoke alarms are really your only chance of getting out safely,\" Wood said. \"If the fire is too large and it grows rapidly, working smoke alarms will give you the time to get out of the home quickly.\"\n\nAccording to the news release, the Office of the Fire Marshal found there were contraventions of the Ontario Fire Code in the home, but investigators did not say how the regulation was violated.\n\nCrews encountered heavy fire, thick smoke\n\nFire crews were called to the scene shortly after 8 a.m. after receiving reports that people were trapped in the home near Bond and Simcoe Streets. Durham police and Oshawa firefighters arrived within minutes.\n\nFirefighters encountered heavy fire and thick smoke.

Such alarms must be installed near all sleeping areas in homes and in service rooms and in sleeping areas of multi-residential units.\n\n\"For as little as $20, the cost of a smoke/carbon monoxide alarm is one of the best investments you can make to keep your family safe,\" Clark said.\n\nClark said it's also important that everyone in a home has an escape plan and knows exactly what to do in the event of a fire.\n\nTenants are required to report to their landlords if smoke and carbon monoxide alarms are not in place, he said.\n\nThe fine for non-working smoke alarms is up to $50,000 for an individual and/or one-year imprisonment.", "It's voting day in the U.S., and for one dual citizen living in Ottawa, the final stretch of the midterm election campaign has been a hands-on experience.\n\nRachel Eugster\u200b travelled to the Upstate New York town of Mexico, about 270 kilometres south of Ottawa, to bolster the campaign team of Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat running for Congress against Republican incumbent Claudia Tenney.\n\n\"I couldn't stay in Ottawa sitting on my hands, doing nothing to help make this change,\" Eugster said in an interview with CBC Radio's All In A Day Monday.\n\n\"With a two- or three-hour drive I could make it down here on the ground, doing the most effective kind of campaigning you can do, which is talking to people at their doors.\"\n\n'It has to be fought'\n\nAmericans are heading to the polls today to vote for members of their House of Representatives, Senator and state governors.\n\nThe outcome will define the next two years of American politics.\n\nDemocrats are favoured to win control of the House, giving them a chance to steer the legislative agenda for the first time since the election of Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nThe Republicans currently control the House, Senate and presidency.\n\n\"I don't even want to talk about how scared I am if the Republicans continue to be in control of all the levers of power at the U.S. government,\" Eugster said.\n\n\"It's very scary for the entire world.\"\n\nWe speak with a Canadian-American Democrat who travelled from Ottawa to the town of Mexico, New York, to volunteer for one of the closely contested races of the election. 8:40\n\nEugster and her husband drove down to the area north of Syracuse, N.Y., Friday night and started canvassing door-to-door for Brindisi's campaign Saturday morning.\n\nShe said the motivation to help stemmed from her alarm that politicians with populist leanings seem to be entering \u2014 and winning \u2014 elections around the world since Trump became president.\n\nRachel Eugster\u200b travelled to the Upstate New York town of Mexico to bolster the campaign team of Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat running for Congress against Republican incumbent Claudia Tenney.

In one week, she had five or six concerned citizens ring her hotline, which she says used to be the volume of calls for an entire season.\n\nThe deer are coming up on rutting season, which means the bucks and does are bounding about in Okotoks trying to find a mate.

Spray them with the hose, get them out the yard.\"\n\nShe says no one likes being sprayed with water, so if citizens turn the hose on deer, the hoofed ruminants will get the idea and move on.\n\nDeer count not going well\n\nOkotoks is still establishing a baseline for how many deer it has, and if that population is increasing. In 2015, the town did its first deer count, and this year an app was launched to help citizens track the animals.\n\nMichailuck says the town didn't have resources in 2016 or 2017 to count does and bucks \u2014 and public enumerating interest waned this season.\n\nOkotoks parks manager Christa Michailuck demonstrates the NatureLynx app, which is free and allows Albertans to record wildlife sightings in the province.

(CBC)\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador's financial position has improved since last spring, although the revised deficit still stands at $547 million, Finance Minister Tom Osborne said Tuesday.\n\nEight months ago, the government had expected to carry a deficit for this fiscal year of $683 million.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Osborne said the government has \"not yet turned a corner [but] it is clearly in sight.\"\n\nThe governing Liberals are a year away from a scheduled election. Nonetheless, Osborne took aim at the former Tory government for leaving his government with a mess, particularly because of the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric development.\n\nOsborne said the government's \"single biggest challenge\" remains Muskrat Falls, and pointed out that about 30 per cent of the province's debt is now attributed to the hydroelectric megaproject.\n\nOsborne presented details of the annual fall fiscal update at Confederation Building, including updated data on the targets that the Liberal government set in its budget.\n\nThe government is predicting they are on target to return to a budget surplus in 2022-2023.\n\nRole of oil price\n\nThe price of oil continues to be an influential factor in the government's treasury.\n\nWhen the budget was tabled in late March, the government was forecasting Brent crude to trade at an average price of $63 US per barrel.\n\nSince then, Brent \u2014 a North Sea crude that is a benchmark for the Newfoundland and Labrador industry, because of its similarity to the oil produced here \u2014 has traded well above that mark, peaking above $86 US earlier this month.\n\nIn a briefing Tuesday, the Department of Finance said every extra dollar on the price of oil translates into provincial revenue of $19.9 million.\n\nThe government was also banking on the Canadian dollar trading at 79 cents US. For the most part, the loonie has traded slightly lower than that. The government now is pegging the dollar at 77 cents.\n\nFinance officials noted that every time the dollar drops a cent, there's an improvement to the provincial treasury of $19.5 million.\n\nUnemployment on the decline\n\nThe province's unemployment rate has dropped slightly from 14.8 per cent to 14.5 per cent since the budget.\n\nOsborne said employment growth has been strong in recent months.\n\nHe added that government expects the unemployment rate to continue shrinking into 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the employment participation rate jumped 1.2 per cent from the spring budget, from 57.8 per cent to 59 per cent of the population now earning an income.\n\nStatus quo, says Hutchings\n\nOpposition House Leader Keith Hutchings, however, was not impressed.\n\n\"There's no real improvement here,\" said Hutchings, noting that the fiscal update maintains the status quo and includes some extra revenue.\n\nHutchings said he has concerns about spending increases over the past number of years, and that the government target of returning to surplus cannot be hit under current practice.\n\n\"Moody's even said it's unlikely in the fourth year of mandate that a government is going to do what it needs to do in regards to expenditures,\" said Hutchings, referring to the U.S.-based ratings agency.\n\n\"So there's no confidence here that the goals are going to be met. Let's call it what it is,\" he said.\n\nKeith Hutchings, MHA and opposition house leader for the Progressive Conservative Party caucus, said his party sees no results in the economic indicators to support economic growth in the province. (CBC)\n\nHutchings is critical of the provincial Liberals' heavy reliance on oil revenues \u2014 something, he said, the Liberals were frequently criticized his party of in the past.\n\n\"There's no economic diversification here, they've talked about it. There's no proof of it,\" he said.\n\n\"The [auditor general] mentioned a couple of years ago that the seven-year plan they laid out is not conceivable, you can't get to it.

Prices are anticipated to range between $501,400 and $521,600.\n\n\"Our key takeaway from this year's outlook is moderation in Canada's housing markets for 2019 into 2020,\" Bob Dugan, chief economist at the CMHC, said in a statement.\n\n\"Housing starts are expected to decline from the higher levels we've seen recently. We expect resales in 2019 and 2020 to remain below recent peaks, while prices should reach levels that are more in line with economic fundamentals such as income, job and populations growth.\"\n\nThe agency expects the number of single-detached housing starts to decrease due to a number of factors including the availability of lot sizes, housing prices and higher borrowing costs.\n\nMulti-unit starts were also expected to decline, partly attributable to smaller anticipated growth in the age group between 25 to 34, who make up a large proportion of first-time buyers. But some of the downward trend could be offset by an aging population looking to downsize.\n\nThe agency expects demand will continue to shift toward relatively less expensive housing options like apartment condominiums versus higher-end single-detached homes.\n\nCMHC says it still sees global trade as a \"risk\" to the Canadian economy and the housing market, despite the recent trade agreement reached between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nRising mortgage rates are also expected to affect housing demand and the resale market.\n\nIn the outlook, CMHC says it anticipates housing prices will \"rise slightly\" after some moderation.\n\n\"However, slower employment and GDP growth, as well as gradually increasing mortgage rates, will restrain the increase in demand for existing homes by 2020,\" said the report. \"As demand moves to lower levels relative to new supply, market conditions are expected to ease.\"\n\nIt also warned that Canadian households remain vulnerable due to heavy debt loads.\n\n\"If interest rates or unemployment rates were to rise more than expected, heavily indebted households could face greater constraints on their consumption leading to downward pressure on the economy and housing activity,\" CMHC said.", "One year after taking over as interim chief of the Montreal police service, Martin Prud'homme says much has been fixed or is in the process of being fixed.\n\nIn a report made public by the Quebec government Tuesday, Prud'homme says a new SPVM administration can be established in a much improved work climate.\n\nHowever, he warns, \"the balance remains fragile,\" and he advises the city and the government to opt for \"prudence, stability and continuity\" when choosing a new police chief.\n\nIn a Tuesday news conference, Quebec's Minister of Public Safety Genevi\u00e8ve Guilbault said Prud'homme's report is a positive step forward.\n\n\"A lot of work has been done,\" she said, although she noted that after only a year of restructuring, there's more to do.\n\n\"We feel the police service is on the right track now,\"\n\nGuilbault said making Prud'homme's final report public should help restore confidence in Montreal's police.\n\n\"People will be able to read it and see what really happened and what has been done in the last year,\" she said. \"I think what we are reading today in the final report is encouraging for the SPVM.\"\n\nLooking forward, she said she agrees with Prud'homme's assertion that the police force now needs continuity and stability.\n\nSPVM restructuring began one year ago\n\nPrud'homme was appointed as interim chief by former Liberal public security minister Martin Coiteux following the suspension of former chief Philippe Pichet.\n\nS\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec Chief Martin Prud'homme took over as both the interim chief and temporary administrator of the Montreal police for a one-year mandate that ends in December.

It's the result of potash \u2014 a byproduct from salt mining, Grant said.\n\nBesides plows and sand, traditionally used in Edmonton, the city now has rock salt, or sodium chloride, in its toolkit to use on some of the city's 11,000-kilometres of roads.\n\nAndrew Grant, field operations supervisor, said the city is using anti-icing agents and traditional plowing to clear the roads. (CBC) \"We're using sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is only used on a piloted area, so we still have a lot of city to cover.\"\n\nThe pilot project using calcium chloride covered 2,840 kilometres last winter, and will include another 295 kilometres of roadway if council approves the $4.1 million request to extend the pilot into next year.\n\nIn a divided vote in October, council gave a preliminary thumbs up to continue with the pilot, despite complaints that the blend is likely causing vehicles to rust.\n\nCoun. Mike Nickel was one of six councillors who voted against extending the pilot project.\n\nNickel expects a report back showing the use of salt and calcium chloride corrodes metal.\n\n\"I don't think this debate is going away anytime soon,\" he said Monday.\n\n\"My prediction is this will be back in front of us when they see the real rust data that comes forward on the infrastructure and our vehicles.\"\n\nCoun. Jon Dziadyk also voted against extending the pilot project using calcium chloride.\n\n\"What we're hearing anecdotally \u2014 a lot of Edmontonians, their cars are rusting, their garage floors show signs of corrosion,\" he said. \"That's what made me uncomfortable.\"\n\nDziadyk hopes to hear solutions that don't necessarily include all sodium or calcium chloride.\n\nCouncil will be asked to approve $4.1 million for the pilot during the upcoming debate on the 2019-2022 operating budget.", "Joel Quenneville knew the deal. After three Stanley Cup titles and nine playoff appearances with the Chicago Blackhawks, the longtime coach figured this was a big season for him.\n\n\"I only think we're in the winning business and we better win,\" Quenneville said on the first day of training camp.\n\nTwo months later, it was over.\n\nThe Blackhawks fired Quenneville on Tuesday, ending a wildly successful run that returned the franchise to the top of the NHL after years of heartache.\n\n\"This is certainly a very difficult decision,\" general manager Stan Bowman said in a statement. \"But I believe it is in the best interests of the Blackhawks organization. We need to maximize each and every opportunity with our playoff goals in mind and create continued growth and development throughout our roster at the same time.\n\n\"After much deliberation the last several days, with great respect to what Joel has meant to the Blackhawks, we knew we had to make a change.\"\n\nAssistants Kevin Dineen and Ulf Samuelsson also were let go. Jeremy Colliton was hired as the 38th head coach in franchise history, and Barry Smith, 66, moved from Chicago's front office to the bench as an assistant coach.\n\nNew coach younger than some players\n\nColliton moves from Chicago's American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford, Illinois, and is now the NHL's youngest head coach at 33. Blackhawks forward Chris Kunitz, defenceman Duncan Keith and goaltenders Corey Crawford and Cam Ward are older than Colliton, and defenceman Brent Seabrook also is 33.\n\n\"All of those associated with Jeremy strongly believe he possesses many of the tools that will make him a successful head coach in this league,\" Bowman said. \"He has been very impressive as a communicator, a leader, and coach. He knows the Blackhawks system, understands our players and our culture and we believe he gives us the best opportunity to have success and grow as a team.\"\n\nBlackhawks announced this morning that they have fired head coach Joel Quenneville <a href=\"https://t.co/wzbOqflnVG\">https://t.co/wzbOqflnVG</a> Did you see this coming? \u2014@hockeynight\n\nThe 60-year-old Quenneville had another year left on a three-year contract extension he signed in 2016 that pays him $6 million US per year, second highest in the NHL behind Mike Babcock in Toronto.\n\n\"He's a good friend, good coach, three Cups. He's going to go in the Hockey Hall of Fame,\" Babcock said Tuesday in Toronto. \"I don't know what else you say about him. If he wants to work, he works.\"\n\nQuenneville was the longest-tenured head coach in the NHL and the second coach fired in the past three days after the Los Angeles Kings dismissed John Stevens on Sunday.\n\n\"It was pretty shocking this morning, actually. That's two in [three] days,\" Vegas coach Gerard Gallant said before the Golden Knights faced the Maple Leafs on Tuesday. \"Joel Quenneville's at the top of the coaching pedigree. It's too bad. It's a part of our business and we all understand that, but it's real tough.\"\n\nWhenever Quenneville wants to get back to work, he likely will have plenty of suitors.\n\nThe former NHL defenceman has 890 wins in 22 years as a head coach with St. Louis, Colorado and Chicago. Scotty Bowman, Stan's father and a senior adviser with the Blackhawks, is the only man with more regular-season victories.\n\nGood run\n\nQuenneville took over Chicago four games into the 2008-09 season, replacing Denis Savard after the Hall of Famer was let go by former general manager Dale Tallon. What followed was an unprecedented run for one of the NHL's Original Six franchises.\n\nJonathan Toews, Patrick Kane and Keith blossomed with Quenneville behind the bench, and the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010, 2013 and 2015. They also made it to the conference finals in 2009 and 2014.\n\n\"His leadership during three Stanley Cup championships speaks for itself and there is no way to adequately express what he has meant to this organization,\" team president John McDonough said in a statement. \"He will always be a significant member of the Blackhawks family.\"\n\nThe trouble for Quenneville began when Chicago was swept by Nashville in the first round of the 2017 playoffs after the Blackhawks finished with the best record in the Western Conference. Then they missed the playoffs entirely last season for the first time in a decade.\n\nAfter getting off to a 6-2-2 start this year, Chicago has dropped five in a row heading into Thursday's home game against Carolina. The power play, a persistent problem, ranked 27th in the NHL heading into Tuesday. The Blackhawks also are allowing an unseemly 3.73 goals per game.\n\nQuenneville finishes with a 452-249-96 record with Chicago. He also went 76-52 in the playoffs with the Blackhawks for the best record in franchise history.\n\nThe dismissal turns up the pressure on Bowman, who has made a couple of questionable moves that helped hasten the Blackhawks' decline. He traded Artemi Panarin to Columbus and Teuvo Teravainen to Carolina in part because of salary-cap issues, and each player has put up big numbers with his new club.", "Nutrien Inc. says it has permanently closed its New Brunswick potash facility after putting the operation on care and maintenance in early 2016.\n\nThe company says it will take a US$1.8-billion writedown in the third quarter due to the closure.\n\nIt says the decision to close the facility reflects the company's ability to increase potash production in Saskatchewan at a significantly lower cost than resuming operations in New Brunswick.\n\nNutrien, then known as the Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan before a merger, shut down its Picadilly mine near Sussex, N.B., at a loss of about 430 jobs close to three years ago to focus on its lower-cost operations in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe news was a shock at the time for the town of 4,300 after Potash Corp. had spent around $2 billion and six years building the facility.\n\nThe company said at the time that the closure would save it upwards of US$50 million a year amid a weak market for the\n\nfertilizer.\n\nPotash Corp. announced a merger with fellow fertilizer company Agrium Inc. later in 2016, creating more combined supply within a single company.", "Environment Canada has issued a rainfall warning for the southern coast of the province, which could see more than 50 millimetres of rain this week.\n\nRainfall warnings are expected in the Saint John area, Fundy National Park, Grand Manan and coastal Charlotte County on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Rain will become heavy at times this evening and taper off in the early morning hours on Wednesday,\" Environment Canada said in a statement.\n\nA special weather statement has been issued for the southern half of the province.\n\nEnvironment Canada said a low pressure system headed toward the Maritimes is expected to bring two periods of heavier rain in the next two days.\n\nAlthough the rain is expected to diminish Tuesday afternoon, a second band of rain will move in overnight.\n\nEnvironment Canada said the heavy downpour could cause flash flooding and water pooling on roads.\n\n\"If visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for taillights ahead and be prepared to stop.\"\n\nThe weather agency said there is still some uncertainty as to where the heaviest rain will occur, and rainfall warnings could be expanded to other areas during the day.", "Former U.S. ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman says Tuesday's midterm elections could serve as \"a loud rebuke\" of President Donald Trump as Americans decide whether to endorse or reject the tone and direction of his presidency with two years left to go.\n\nHeyman, a Democrat who was appointed ambassador by then-president Barack Obama in 2014 and served in the post for nearly three years, blasted Trump in an interview Tuesday morning, saying America has \"had the most divisive, ethically and morally challenged presidency over the last two years. And this is a time for Americans to determine what type of America they want.\"\n\nWith some 30 million Americans casting ballots in early voting, Heyman is hopeful that as many as 100 million voters will head to the polls. He expects voters to \"judge [Trump] on his values and he needs a checks and balance, which we don't have right now.\"\n\nHeyman listed the ban against some Muslim travellers, introduced days into Trump's presidency, and migrant children separated from their parents at the border, as well as misogynistic language that surfaced during Trump's presidential campaign, to explain his own strong language and expectations for how the day will turn out politically.\n\n\"This man is not what most Americans want, need or expect from the president of the United States, and I think they are going to voice that,\" Heyman told CBC Radio's Metro Morning.\n\nAll 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives are up for grabs Tuesday, as are 35 of 100 Senate seats and 39 state and territorial governorships, in addition to other state and local offices.\n\nObama has been out on the campaign trail for Democratic candidates, saying at one rally that \"the character of our nation is on the ballot.\"\n\nAsked what his former boss means by that, Heyman said: \"It's about decency. This is a vote about being a decent person and being a decent country. It's about caring for those that are less fortunate.\"\n\nHeyman suspects the Republicans will lose control of the House, as well as lose some governorships and state races, arguing that the party will retain its base, but little more.\n\n\"I think that this has the potential of being a loud rebuke of the president,\" Heyman said.\n\n'It's not unique to America'\n\nAsked whether the U.S. president has tapped into sentiments that were already bubbling under the surface in America, Heyman said populist politics is \"not unique to America.\"\n\n\"We are going through a fairly significant economic change worldwide where the technological revolution is displacing a lot of workers,\" he said. The gap between rich and poor is \"growing ever wider,\" he added, noting that \"it's hard to blame an iPhone for your fate in life, or technology or robotics. It's easier to blame a person.\"\n\nBut to the suggestion that the results of Tuesday's vote could, in fact, exacerbate the divide in America, Heyman said that's not what worries him.\n\n\"What worries me is the vitriol and the divide.\"\n\nThere have always been \"spirited debates\" between Democrats and Republicans about the future of the country, Heyman said.\n\n\"But when you become so disagreeable and so hostile and so angry, that is not acceptable. I always say you can disagree but you don't have to be disagreeable. You can disagree and then go out and have a drink afterwards and sit down and talk through how to find paths so it's a win-win and not I win, you lose,\" Heyman said.\n\n\"That's the path we need to get back on, but it has to start at the top, and unfortunately we have a president who is into the language of the divide. And we're going to have him for at least two more years, and so we need that checks and balance and hopefully we will get that today.\"", "Allyson MacIvor will never forget her first concert experience at Rogers Place, but it wasn't the experience she wanted.\n\nMacIvor and her friend were watching Jack White as he played The White Stripes' hit Seven Nation Army Friday night when they turned to each other for a kiss.\n\nWhile they are not in a relationship, the women were caught up in the moment.\n\nWithin moments, the two were confronted by a Rogers Place usher.\n\n\"I embraced my girlfriend, and some staff member came in between us, and she said, 'This is not allowed here,'\" MacIvor said.\n\nThe usher placed her hand in between them and asked them to stop, MacIvor said.\n\n\"It was very violating and invasive,\" MacIvor said. \"It's not something I'd ever imagine experiencing, honestly.\"\n\nThe usher then escorted them to talk to a manager.

The federal government announced in late May it would buy the pipeline and related components for $4.5 billion.\n\nThe government intends to finance and manage construction of the second pipeline \u2014 which would increase the overall flow of bitumen to 890,000 barrels a day \u2014 and ultimately try to find a buyer.\n\nThe CSIS brief characterizes resistance to the pipeline project as a \"developing intelligence issue.\"\n\n\"Indigenous and non-Indigenous opponents of the project continue to highlight the increasing threats to the planet as a result of climate change and the incompatibility of new pipeline and oil sands projects with Canada's 2015 commitment under the Paris Climate Accord,\" the brief says.\n\n\"At the same time, many within the broader Indigenous community view the federal government's purchase and possible financing, construction and operation of an expanded bitumen pipeline as wholly incompatible with its attempts at Crown-Indigenous reconciliation.\"\n\nThe pipeline acquisition and commitment to complete the project is therefore \"viewed as a betrayal\" by many within both the environmental and Indigenous communities, CSIS says.\n\n\"Indigenous opposition at the grassroots level remains strong. In response to the federal purchase, numerous Indigenous and environmental organizations have restated their commitment to prevent construction.\"\n\nThe brief singles out the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion, noting it has signatories from over 50 North American First Nations in its bid to halt the project. It also features a May quote from Canadian environmental organization Stand.earth that the decision \"will haunt the Trudeau government.\"\n\nThe intelligence brief was completed a little more than two months before the Federal Court of Appeal quashed government approval of the pipeline project due to inadequate consultation with Indigenous groups and failure to properly assess the effect of increased tanker traffic in the waters off British Columbia.\n\nIn the wake of the court ruling, the federal government ordered the National Energy Board to reassess the tanker issue and asked a former Supreme Court justice to oversee fresh consultations with Indigenous communities.\n\nThat was a matter for police and the courts, and was done out in the open \u2014 it should not be a matter for our spy agency. - Josh Paterson\n\nThe CSIS brief notes there had been \"no acts of serious violence\" stemming from peaceful demonstrations and blockades at Trans Mountain facilities in British Columbia that resulted in the arrest of more than 200 people, or at smaller protests across the country.\n\nHowever, the document includes a section titled \"Violent Confrontations and Resource Development\" that mentions past conflicts over shale-gas development in New Brunswick and a high-profile pipeline in North Dakota.\n\nIt is unclear, because of the redactions to the document, exactly what CSIS was looking at, said Josh Paterson, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, which has expressed strong concern about the spy service's monitoring of activists.\n\nIn the information that has been released, there is no suggestion of a threat to national security or critical infrastructure, of clandestine activities or of violence in relation to the Trans Mountain project, Paterson said.\n\n\"While some opponents of the pipeline were arrested during protest for breaching a court order, that was a matter for police and the courts, and was done out in the open \u2014 it should not be a matter for our spy agency.\"\n\nIt's certainly not our intention to ever pursue violence. -Tegan Hansen\n\nGiven past interest on the part of security and police officials, the CSIS brief is not surprising, said Tegan Hansen, a spokeswoman for Protect the Inlet, an Indigenous-led effort against the pipeline and tanker project.\n\nBut she is curious as to why the spy service document makes reference to sabotage and violent physical confrontations.\n\n\"I'm not sure why they're trying to draw that connection with violence,\" Hansen said. \"I'd be interested to know.

He won double gold by taking the technical events -- the giant slalom and the slalom.\n\nBut perhaps more intriguing was the fact that his passion ran wild for champion figure skater, Katarina Witt of Germany, who performed seductively to Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\" on the way to capturing a gold medal over her skating rival Debi Thomas of the United States who ironically also skated to music from \"Carmen.\"\n\n\"In 1988, the stars shone bright,\" said four-time world figure skating champion Kurt Browning, who made the first of his three Olympic appearances in Calgary.\n\n\"Tomba was chasing Katarina and trying to charm her.

Find summaries of the other two systems here:\n\nA system invented by a Canadian university student that would expand riding sizes and match the vote percentage for parties to the number of seats, dual member proportional was considered by Prince Edward Island voters in a 2016 referendum but has never been used as a electoral system.\n\nIn one sentence\n\nDual member proportional lets people directly pick their local representative while ensuring the percentage of seats a party gets is equal to the percentage of votes they receive, through a complicated formula that determines how the second MLA in each district is chosen.\n\nWhat would the ballot look like?\n\nIn B.C.'s rural ridings, the ballot would look exactly the same and one candidate would be chosen.\n\nIn B.C.'s rural ridings, the ballot would look exactly the same and one candidate would be chosen. (CBC)\n\nIn urban and semi-urban ridings, people will also only vote once, but ultimately two people would be elected.\n\nWe'll get to how that works next, but the ballot would contain both independent candidates and parties. And the parties could choose to have one person listed for each riding, or two \u2014 a primary candidate and a secondary candidate.\n\nIn B.C.'s rural ridings, the ballot would look exactly the same and one candidate would be chosen. In urban and semi-urban ridings, people will also only vote once, but ultimately two people would be elected. (CBC)\n\nHow would MLAs be determined?\n\nThe candidate or party with the most votes in each riding is elected.\n\nIn places where a party has put forward two candidates, the primary candidate is the region's first MLA.\n\nBut the second MLA is chosen in a way that ensures each party gets the same percentage of seats as percentage of votes.\n\n\"The proportionality would basically be as good as mathematically possible in B.C. Generally, a party that gets 10 per cent of the vote in DMP would get 10 per cent of the seats,\" said Sean Graham, who created the system in 2013 while a student at the University of Alberta.\n\nDual member proportional lets people directly pick their local representative while ensuring the percentage of seats a party gets is equal to the percent of votes they receive, through a complicated formula that determines how the second MLA in each district is chosen. (CBC)\n\nThe majority of time, this would mean the second place party would get the second seat, with their primary candidate in the riding becoming an MLA. Occasionally though \u2014 Graham estimates between five and ten per cent of the time \u2014 the first place party's secondary candidate would be chosen instead.\n\nThis would generally happen in ridings where a party does exceptionally well: think the NDP in some East Vancouver ridings or the B.C. Liberals in the Fraser Valley.\n\nWhat are the advantages of this system?\n\n\"One of the assets is its familiarity,\" said Graham.\n\nHe believes it combines the most important element of first-past-the-post (a directly elected representative) and proportional representation (having a party's per cent of votes match the per cent of MLAs it elects).\n\n\"It would do a very good job of incorporating all the regions of the province. It would allow rural areas to be completely included in the reform and it would provide provincewide proportionality. British Columbians would have a very similar voting experience when they go to the polls as they do now but would know their vote would count.\"\n\nWhat could be the disadvantages?\n\nThe system of how individual politicians are chosen is less direct than some other forms of proportional representation \u2014 while the makeup of the legislature would match the overall vote totals, there will be dozens of MLAs chosen as the \"second member\" who received fewer votes than the winners in their riding.\n\nAnd because the system is the only one of the three that guarantees a direct relationship between number of MLAs and number of votes, it's the most likely to create minority governments \u2014 which some argue would create more political instability and could lead to extremist parties holding the balance of power.\n\nWould the size of my riding change?\n\nIn the majority of rural ridings, the area would be the same, but every other riding would approximately double in size.\n\nSo, in Victoria, a riding would likely be created covering the current boundaries of Victoria-Beacon Hill and Victoria-Swan Lake. Or on the North Shore, one could be created combining North Vancouver-Lonsdale with North Vancouver-Seymour.\n\nIn the majority of rural ridings, the area would be the same, but every other riding would approximately double in size. (CBC)\n\nCould smaller parties and independents get elected?\n\nParties would have to receive at least five per cent of the provincewide vote to have members elected \u2014 but once they clear that threshold, they'd be guaranteed to receive the same per cent of seats as per cent of votes they got.\n\nIn addition, they would automatically take any seats where they got the most votes, even if they failed to cross the five per cent provincewide threshold.\n\nWhat would be determined after the referendum?\n\nLike the other two systems on the ballot, an all-party legislative committee would decide the total number of MLAs \u2014 either a specific number or a general range, with a maximum of 95 in total.\n\nAn independent electoral boundaries commission would then have to create the province's new electoral map, including how many ridings would be considered rural single-member districts and the exact size of the dual-member urban districts.\n\nCBC Vancouver will have special coverage of the debate between B.C.

When they grow fast they tend to have low mercury.\"\n\nThe faster fish grow the less likely they are to be contaminated by mercury, she added.\n\nHeidi Swanson, an associate professor with the University of Waterloo, is leading the research. (Points North/CBC)\n\nThese tests follow similar methods used in harvesting fish in Sweden, Finland and Norway; where older larger fish were taken from their habitat. As the smaller fish grew they had less mercury in their system.\n\nSwanson says she hopes for similar results with fish near Jean Marie River.\n\n\"In every lake there are really safe and healthy sources of fish,\" she said. \"We want people to feel confident in making their traditional food choices.\"\n\nPermafrost often behind increased mercury levels\n\nMelting permafrost has been identified as one reason why mercury levels are increasing, but not all lakes are seeing the same rate of mercury elevation.\n\nSwanson and her team have researched mercury levels in the territory's lakes since 2013. The research's overall mission is to find why mercury levels vary in lakes across the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn lakes near Kakisa, N.W.T., algae slows the effects of mercury on fish living there, Swanson explained.\n\n\"It dilutes the mercury level out and makes the fish grow really fast,\" she said. \"When fish are growing fast they tend to have low mercury,\" she said.\n\nResearch on human levels has a positive result\n\nThe researchers are also examining the effects of mercury on people living in the Dehcho and Sahtu regions in the territory.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be an issue with people who have eaten the contaminated fish, explained George Low, who co-ordinates the aquatic resources and oceans management program for the Dehcho First Nations,\n\n\"Fish is probably one of the best protein diets you could have,\" he said. \"We don't want to discourage people from eating fish but we also have to make sure if there's a problem they're not exposed overly to that problem.\"\n\nDespite worries from some people about eating contaminated fish, they shouldn't be concerned, Low said.\n\n\"When you start a study like this everybody is saying 'I'm not eating any fish any more' or that sort of thing but you need to put it into perspective that there is a lot of good fish out there,\" said Low.\n\nCommunity updates before the new year\n\nSo far, researchers studied 11 lakes in the Northwest Territories, Low explained.\n\nRepresentatives from the research team will meet with community members from Wrigley, Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson by the end of the year to provide an update on mercury levels.\n\nEarlier this month the federal government committed over $33,000 to the project through Northern Contaminants Program.", "The case of a former Edmonton inmate who has spent five-and-a-half years in segregation highlights defects in federally proposed changes to prison segregation laws, say prisoner rights advocates.\n\nBrook McCargar has been locked up in segregation 27 times totalling more than 2,000 days since he entered federal prison in March 2012. More than half of that time was at the Edmonton Institution, a maximum security prison for men.\n\n\"The idea that somebody could be held that long in segregation is abhorrent,\" said Noa Mendelsohn Aviv, director of the equality program with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA). \"And in the absence of a hard cap it can go on endlessly, and this is an example of where it goes on endlessly.\"\n\nNoa Mendelsohn Aviv with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association says Bill C-83 doesn't resolve the constitutional issues of segregation. Last month federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale unveiled Bill C-83, which would reform the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, amid growing criticism over the use of administrative segregation at federal prisons.\n\nThe Ontario Superior Court struck down Canada's solitary confinement laws as unconstitutional in December in response to a court challenge by the CCLA. But the association has appealed the ruling citing the need for more robust safeguards to prevent continued abuse and concerns about the confinement of young and mentally ill inmates.\n\nThe B.C. Civil Liberties Association and the John Howard Society of Canada are also fighting the federal government's appeal of a Supreme Court ruling that said indefinite solitary confinement of prisoners is unconstitutional and causes permanent harm.\n\nIf passed, Bill C-83 would require that inmates considered unmanageable in the general population be housed in separate wings called structured intervention units, while providing tailored access to rehabilitation, mental health care and other programs.\n\nPrisoners would be allowed outside of their cells for four hours a day and have access to two hours a day of human contact.\n\nBut Mendelsohn Aviv said Bill C-83 still fails to provide sufficient human contact or an independent review that would prevent a breach of United Nations' standards on solitary confinement. CCLA intends to proceed with its court challenge.\n\nInmate Brook McCargar speaks to CBC about why he self-harmed at Edmonton Institution where rates are higher than any other maximum security prison for men. 1:35 \"Bill C-83 does not resolve the constitutional issues raised in our challenge,\" Mendelsohn Aviv said.\n\nMcCargar, who pleaded guilty to a violent home invasion, spoke to CBC News as part of an investigation that revealed more inmates intentionally injure themselves at Edmonton Institution compared to any other maximum security prison for men in Canada. Prisoner rights advocates say solitary confinement worsens self-harming behaviour which includes slashing and head-banging.\n\nOver the years, McCargar says he has slashed himself with razors, plastic knives and bits of metal to protest conditions, to alleviate boredom and to interact with normal people in a hospital setting.\n\nA report released last week by Canada's Correctional Investigator, Ivan Zinger, found Correctional Services of Canada's (CSC) psychiatric hospitals were understaffed and staff were underqualified, leading to an overuse of segregation and uses of force.\n\n\"There's nothing in Bill C-83 that specifically limits the placement of people with mental health issues in these structured intervention units,\" said Catherine Latimer, executive director of the John Howard Society. \"There's no independent oversight of the reasons for placement or the duration of placement and everything is within the discretion of the Correctional Services of Canada.\"\n\nHopefully the day will come when the rest of the world will again be able to look to Canada as a model of best practice in the manner it treats its prisoners - Professor Andrew Coyle\n\nAndrew Coyle, professor emeritus of prison studies at the overseas University of London and a former prison governor, described the Canadian Liberal government's proposed reforms to solitary confinement as \"a belated but very welcome first step.\"\n\n'For many years those involved in prison management and reform in many countries worldwide looked to Canada, and particularly CSC, as a model of decent and humane treatment of its prisoners,\" Coyle wrote in an email to CBC. \"Unfortunately that is no longer the case.\"\n\nCoyle pointed to 19-year-old Ashley Smith's self-inflicted strangulation death at the Grand Valley Institution for Women in Kitchener, Ont., in 2007 that was later ruled a homicide.\n\n\"Since then there have been several other court cases and damning official reports about the excessive use of solitary confinement,\" wrote Coyle. \"Hopefully the day will come when the rest of the world will again be able to look to Canada as a model of best practice in the manner it treats its prisoners.\"\n\nConstitutionally compliant\n\nA statement from Goodale's office said the government believes C-83 is fully compliant with constitutional requirements, noting previous comments by the minister.\n\n\"The passage of this legislation will put Canada in the forefront of progressive effective correctional systems that achieve safety and security both inside and outside the institutions and at the same time achieve the principles of rehabilitation and safe reintegration into society,\" Goodale said when the bill was introduced.\n\nRepeated allegations of abuse at the hands of correctional staff at Edmonton Institution have triggered criminal and internal investigations, staff dismissals and a flurry of lawsuits, including one filed last week by an inmate who says he was shot in the testicles at close range.\n\nPrisoner rights advocates say internal investigations and recommendations by the prison watchdog have not been effective and a public inquiry into the problems at Edmonton Institution is needed.\n\nandrea.huncar@cbc.ca\n\n@andreahuncar", "More than 200 mass graves containing between 6,000 and 12,000 bodies have been found in Iraq from the time of ISIS's three-year reign, UN investigators said Tuesday.\n\nThe 202 graves verified by investigators dot northern Iraq and are a legacy of ISIS's \"terror,\" the UN mission to Iraq and the UN office for human rights said in the joint report.

We weren't trying to do that,\" he said. \"We were trying to tell a story about a mother and her son.\"\n\n'People connect with the film'\n\nSince its summer debut in Ottawa's Asinabka film festival, the film has also been shown at the Reel Pride film festival and the imagineNATIVE Film and Media Arts Festival.\n\nDaniels said hearing from audiences afterwards been eye-opening for him as a filmmaker.\n\n\"A lot of people connect with the film because they know someone who is murdered or missing, be they male or female, and they understand what it's like to go through this kind of experience,\" he said.\n\nOne of the key messages Daniels hopes people take from the film is that \"everyone deserves to come home.\"\n\n\"Also, that someone out there knows,\" he said.\n\n\"Someone out there knows where Colten is and so we just want that one person to come forward and at least tell us where we can find him.\"\n\nWith files from Robin Summerfield and Aidan Geary", "The Atlantic Coastal Action Program (ACAP) Saint John has launched a harbour seal monitoring program that could include using drones and satellite tagging to find out more about the mammals and their activities in the area.\n\nGraeme Stewart-Robertson, the group's executive director, says the program has been a long time coming, with \"a lot of information gaps\" to fill.\n\n\"We realized that despite promoting [harbour seals] to tourists and within our own community \u2026 with the names of mascots or sports teams that we really don't have a clear understanding of what these seals are doing,\" he said.\n\n\"So it's really exciting for us to be able to move forward on a project like this and to hopefully address some of those questions.\"\n\nGraeme Stewart-Robertson, executive director of ACAP Saint John, is encouraging citizens to participate in the project by submitting any photos or observations they make about harbour seals. (CBC)\n\nAlthough some research has already been conducted by University of New Brunswick scientists, among others, much of the work has focused on the Bay of Fundy as a whole, or looked at the impact of seals on aquaculture, which is predominantly located west of Saint John, said Stewart-Robertson.\n\nACAP's project, being done in collaboration with researchers at UNB, Fisheries and Oceans Canada officials and other groups will focus on the Saint John Harbour for the next two-and-a-half years.\n\nStaff of the non-profit organization started doing some field observations last week to determine where some of the key haul-out sites are, where seals come out of the water to rest or breed.\n\n\"Those are our most critical spots,\" said Stewart-Robertson.\n\nThe number of such sites has been reduced over the years by development and infill, he said, but there are still others, including Shack Rogs, Manawagonish Island and Round Reef, off of Tin Can Beach.\n\n'Phenomenal' data\n\nCrews plan to use drones to evaluate the harbour seals, as well as grey seals, to avoid getting too close and scaring them away.\n\nThey also hope to use satellite tagging to track them, providing it can be done safely for both staff and the seals.\n\n\"It would certainly not be easy,\" said Stewart-Robertson, noting it would involve locating the seals, tranquilizing them and attaching trackers to them with an adhesive that lasts about six months in the ocean in order to get the GPS satellite tagging locations.\n\nStill, \"the hope is there because the amount of data we would get from that would be phenomenal,\" he said.\n\nIt could, for example, provide a better understanding of whether the seals are resident to the harbour or travel to other areas such as Charlotte County or Kennebecasis Bay.\n\nStewart-Robertson expects to spend the first year assessing the feasibility and developing a plan.\n\nGraeme Stewart-Robertson is the executive director of ACAP Saint John. The project will take stock of seals in our harbour and region. 9:31\n\nIn the meantime, ACAP wants to engage the public in the project, and is encouraging citizens to report when they see seals, and ideally, take photographs of them.\n\n\"Having that community input of \u2013 'Oh, I saw five seals hauled out on the rocks at Manawagonish Island,\" or 'I saw them at \u2026\u200b Mispec' that's really helpful to have that citizen science component as well because it gives us more eyes in the community.\"\n\nA special platform to submit photos and detailed information, such as time of day and weather conditions, will be developed in the coming months, but ACAP's Facebook page and website can be used for now, he said.", "Months before she even wrote her Grade 9 final math exam, Anita Hofer's daughter was already worried she was going to fail the standardized test.\n\nThe Calgary mom said she encouraged her daughter to \"buckle down on her studying, and her note-taking and to be really paying attention in class,\" thinking a little more effort would be enough for the otherwise strong student.\n\n\"We really didn't have any indications from her report cards that she was going to be flunking the exam, and that's exactly what happened,\" Hofer said.\n\nAcross Alberta, 13,800 students in Grade 9 \u2014 a third of those who wrote the exam \u2014 failed the Provincial Achievement Test in math. A similar share of students in the Calgary Board of Education also fell short of the province's acceptable standard.\n\nThe high failure rate caused considerable hand-wringing among students, parents and teachers, especially given revelations the province considers a 42 per cent mark a passing grade.\n\nParents went to social media and call-in radio shows, openly worried about the quality of math education, and sparked debate over various teaching methods, including calls for a return to the old-fashioned way of memorizing times tables.\n\nDays later, there was strong indication Albertans were not alone in their math woes when the Ontario government announced all new teachers must pass a mandatory math test before entering the classroom.\n\nThe debate over pre-high school math scores has raged in Alberta for decades. While some observers say the causes of the latest score slump are too complicated to narrow down, some teachers say what has been lost in the latest row over results is their claim that the tests \u2014 not the teaching \u2014 are to blame.\n\n'Math-phobia'\n\nOn the last day of classes in June, some Grade 9 students left Alicia Burdess' classroom in tears after agonizing over the standardized math test. Some gave up, leaving swaths of the answer sheet blank.\n\nBurdess, a Grande Prairie teacher who has coached colleagues on math education and once served on a provincial math council, said the timed exam was a source of stress and failed to accurately measure the math skills of her students.\n\nAlicia Burdess, a Grande Prairie math teacher, worries student angst over standardized tests will fuel what she calls 'math-phobia.' (Submitted)\n\nShe worries their angst over the test will only fuel what she calls \"math-phobia,\" a systemic fear that has made it \"socially acceptable to say we're not good at math, where we would never say that about reading.\"\n\nShe's not alone.\n\nUnion calls testing system 'broken'\n\nAfter the results were released, other teachers shared with each other their own criticisms with the test. One point of contention was a new segment requiring students to solve 20 math problems in 20 minutes without a calculator, with some extra time allotted.\n\nA teacher from central Alberta wrote to a colleague the non-calculator portion shouldn't have been timed, explaining the ordeal \"has caused unnecessary stress and dislike for math and creates an environment that breeds math anxiety.\"\n\nThe teachers' union has a similar view. In interviews, the Alberta Teachers' Association said the standardized testing system is broken, and one local president in Calgary said the Provincial Achievement Test should be scrapped, saying it's not a reliable assessment of student abilities.\n\nBurdess also has serious problems with the test.\n\n\"I have students that are doing bigger, more beautiful math than they've probably ever done, and they're learning it at a deeper level,\" she said.\n\n\"They're learning to problem-solve. They're learning how to collaborate with others. They're learning how to communicate their thinking. And it's just not possible (to assess those skills) on a test like that.\"\n\nTesting system will change, minister said\n\nEducation Minister David Eggen said he understands the latest Grade 9 math test was difficult. But he believes scores will improve in the years ahead as students get used to studying without a calculator, adding that knowing how to do math the old-fashioned way is an important life skill.\n\nEggen said student assessments are essential to ensuring quality education in schools. But he said the testing system will likely change as the province rolls out a new Kindergarten to Grade 12 curriculum.\n\nDavid Eggen, Alberta's Education Minister, said math test scores for Grade 9 students will likely improve in the coming years. (CBC)\n\n\"We're constantly looking for feedback from students and teachers and parents to make what we do better all the time,\" he said.\n\nAcknowledging concerns the exam may not properly measure math skills, Eggen said: \"That is useful information, and I certainly will take it back to my assessment division.\"\n\n'We're capable of doing a lot better'\n\nThe opposition to Alberta's standardized tests is not universal.\n\nJonathan Chin, a Grade 6 teacher in Calgary, said these exams accurately assess student understanding of problem-solving and mental math, though he notes they are challenging.\n\nStill, he said he wasn't happy about the latest math results, arguing, \"we're capable of doing a lot better.\"\n\nChin said many factors could be at play in why the latest Grade 9 scores were low. He said each student has to be assessed individually on what may be holding them back. Do they understand what the question is asking them to do, and do they know the calculations involved?\n\nBut the provincial test isn't the only standardized measure of student achievement. When stacked up against other provinces and countries in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Alberta students perform fairly well.\n\nNational and global comparisons\n\nPISA results are based on a random sample of 15-year-old students, as opposed to Alberta's method of attempting to test every student in certain grades. This means the PISA results are an estimate.\n\nIn 2015, the latest year for which results are available, Alberta math scores were in line with the Canadian average, with only Quebec coming in higher than the national benchmark. Alberta math results were also higher than those of all but 10 countries or economies. Seventy-two were ranked.\n\nIn science, Alberta performed far better. Its average scores led the country and were better globally than all but one country \u2014 Singapore.\n\nThe province's Grade 9 math scores in the Provincial Achievement Test have long been lower than in other subject areas, said education researcher Elaine Simmt. She conducted a study of student performance in the late 1990s when Alberta Education officials were worried about low math test results.\n\nDavid Martin, a high school math teacher in Red Deer who has led professional development courses across the province, said some of the sample questions for the most recent standardized math tests were 'ridiculous.' (Submitted)\n\nAt the time, Simmt looked into schools that were achieving high marks and interviewed teachers with novel approaches to helping students visualize math, like measuring the circumferences of circles with cans and string. Other teachers set high expectations and devoted time to math contests.\n\nEven recording answers not easy\n\nSimmt, an education professor at the University of Alberta, agreed with Chin that it's difficult to pinpoint the causes behind the latest low scores given that students have unique challenges and strengths.\n\nShe said standardized tests are not a perfect measure of student skills. Once students solve a given problem, she said they have to record what may be a complicated answer in a bubble sheet, writing the numerator, the fraction bar and the denominator in separate columns.\n\n\"Even filling out the sheet itself is difficult,\" she said. \"It's not just about calculating; now it is understanding the language of numerator and denominator, and getting it on the answer sheet correctly.\"\n\nThe province declined to publicly reveal the questions from the latest tests because officials will use some of them in the next exam, and don't want to give them away. But Alberta Education did publish sample questions to help students prepare.\n\nSimmt said the questions were complicated, though \"I expect Grade 9 students to be able to answer them.\"\n\nSome sample questions were 'ridiculous'\n\nDavid Martin sees it differently. A high school math teacher who has led professional development courses across the province, Martin said some of the sample questions were bizarre.\n\nFor instance, one question that was meant to be answered in 60 seconds without a calculator asked for the square root of 145/4, to the nearest whole number.\n\n\"Some of these questions are ridiculous, for a lack of a better word,\" Martin said. \"As a math guy, I can't even come up with a real-life example that you would even do this kind of math for, other than maybe a skill-testing question on the back of a ballot.\"\n\nStill, Calgary mom Hofer said her daughter's performance in the standardized test has her worried about what the teenager may be up against as she starts a semester of Grade 10 math in January. Hofer said she's already hired a tutor.\n\n\"I'm hearing from lots of parents that their child's having a really hard time in math at this stage and that they're going into high school, and they're unequipped or they're ill-equipped, and they're paying lots of money for tutors to pad the education that their kids have already had.\"", "Cape Breton regional council members are getting a pay raise, but they won't see a cent of it.\n\nThe federal government is eliminating the one-third tax-free salary politicians have enjoyed for years.\n\nProvincial MLAs and Halifax regional councillors eliminated the benefit years ago, and CBRM officials say most municipal councils are boosting council remuneration to compensate for the lost benefit.\n\nNet pay the same\n\nCBRM council voted to hike councillor pay about 17 per cent and the mayor's pay about 24 per cent, which takes effect when the federal benefit ends on Jan 1.\n\nThe pay hike means elected officials be taxed on the entire salary, but take home the same net pay as before.\n\nCoun.

But they are working harder to hide their tracks, according to government investigators, academics and security firms.\n\nResearchers studying the spread of disinformation on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other platforms say the new, more subtle tactics have allowed most of the so-called information operations campaigns to survive purges by the big social media companies and avoid government scrutiny.\n\n\"The Russians are definitely not sitting this one out\" said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. \"They have adapted over time to increased [U.S.] focus on influence operations.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies say Russia used disinformation and other tactics to support U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The Russian government has rejected all allegations of election interference.\n\nOne clear sign of the continued Russian commitment to disrupting American political life came out in charges unsealed last month against a Russian woman who serves as an accountant at a St. Petersburg company known as the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAfter spending $12 million US on a project to influence the U.S. election through social media in 2016, the company budgeted $12.2 million for last year and then proposed spending $10 million in just the first half of 2018, court filings showed.\n\nAmplifying internet 'memes'\n\nThe indictment said the Internet Research Agency used fake social media accounts to post on both sides of politically charged issues including race, gun control and immigration. The instructions were detailed, down to how to mock particular politicians during a specific news cycle.\n\nIf the goals of spreading divisive content have remained the same, the methods have evolved in multiple ways, researchers say. For one, there has been less reliance on pure fiction. People have been sensitized to look for completely false stories, and Facebook has been using outside fact checkers to at least slow their spread on its pages.\n\n\"We've done a lot research on fake news and people are getting better at figuring out what it is, so it's become less effective as a tactic,\" said Priscilla Moriuchi, a former National Security Agency official who is now a threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future threat manager.\n\nInstead, Russian accounts have been amplifying stories and internet \"memes\" that initially came from the U.S. far left or far right. Such postings seem more authentic, are harder to identify as foreign, and are easier to produce than made-up stories.\n\nRenee DiResta, director of research at security company New Knowledge, said her company had compiled a list of suspected Russian accounts on Facebook and Twitter that were similar to those suspended after the 2016 campaign.\n\nSome of them seized on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court to rally conservatives, while others used memes from the leftist Occupy Democrats. Some operators of the accounts in the collection established themselves as far-right pundits and had accounts on Gab, the social network favoured by the far right.\n\n'Blexit' campaign\n\nBrookie said that while the Russian accounts might jump on a hot topic, the payoff would often come by throwing in related issues.\n\nBut that need not be necessary when the main topic is divisive enough. Take the idea of \"Blexit,\" a call for black Americans to exit the Democratic Party. The Daily Beast said it captured 250,000 tweets with the Blexit hashtag during a 15-hour burst last week and found that 40,000 of them came from handles that had previously participated in Russian information campaigns.\n\nThough jumping on existing bandwagons is easier than what Russia did in 2016, other new tactics have been more complex.\n\nA FaceBook 'Elections USA' sign stands in the media area in Cleveland before the first Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015.

Supreme Court judge G.C. Weatherill dismissed the application on Nov. 2.\n\nBCSEPS lost, despite claiming that the reduction would result in fewer doctors performing cataract surgery as they deal with rising costs and overhead.\n\nB.C. currently has a wait-list of approximately 22,000 patients.\n\nThere have been only two occasions in B.C.'s history when fees paid to physicians have been reduced, according to the ruling: a 21 per cent reduction in 2012 and the 17.7 percent reduction that took effect on Oct. 1 \u2014 both to the same cataract surgery fee codes.\n\nThe ruling cited the principle of \"sustainability,\" so that the province's annual health expenditures are \"within taxpayers' ability to pay ... not compromising the ability of government to meet the health needs of current and future generations.\"\n\nBCSEPS falls under the umbrella of the B.C. Medical Association (BCMA) \u2014 now known as the Doctors of BC \u2014 which represents all physicians and surgeons in the province.\n\nIn cataract surgery, the clouded lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens to restore clearer vision.

But, quietly, it's homeowners who have been paying a larger and larger share of the bill.\n\nYou've likely read stories talking about \"soaring\" tax rates on commercial properties and a rising \"tax burden\" on businesses.\n\nAnd there's no doubt some business owners \u2014 particularly those in suburban areas with increasing property values \u2014 have been hit hard lately by sudden tax increases. Some, in fact, have faced massive increases. This comes from the arcane and uneven way that property-tax calculations work.\n\nBusiness owners complained \u2014 loudly.\n\nSome have even closed up shop.\n\nIn response, city council has taken special steps for the past two years to blunt that blow, with $86 million in targeted tax relief. And today, members of council will consider spending $89 million more to extend this relief again in 2019 to businesses facing the steepest tax increases.\n\nBut, when you look at the city as a whole \u2014 at all the taxpayers \u2014 you might be surprised by what the numbers show.\n\nThe net municipal taxes paid by Calgary businesses this year will actually decrease by about $25 million, when you factor in the already-approved tax relief and the phase-out of the city's old-fashioned business tax (a soon-to-be extinct fee that is separate from property taxes). Homeowners, meanwhile, will pay about $20 million more than they did last year.\n\nThis continues a general trend over the past decade, in which Calgary's revenue comes increasingly from residential taxes and less from commercial taxes.\n\nNow, before people get all up in arms about what's fair and what isn't, it's worth noting that this shift actually puts our city more in line with the way other cities work.\n\nFor a long time now, Calgary homeowners have enjoyed relatively low property tax bills and the city has relied on a strong commercial sector to pick up an unusually large share of the tab. But that has been changing, slowly and steadily.\n\nAnd there are indications it could shift even faster in the future.\n\nHere's why.\n\nShifting tax burden\n\nBusinesses still pay the majority of the municipal taxes in Calgary, but their share has been shrinking.\n\nA decade ago, commercial taxes accounted for 59 per cent of city's total tax revenue.\n\nToday, that's down to about 55 per cent.\n\nYou can see how the gap has been narrowing in the graph below.\n\nEven with these changes, Calgary remains unusual in its tax split.\n\n\"Calgary is a little bit unique in the sense that tax is higher on the business side than on the residential side,\" said Alan Arcand, associate director with the Centre for Municipal Studies at the Conference Board of Canada.\n\nYep, we're the exception, not the rule.\n\nIn other major cities, it's homeowners \u2014 not businesses \u2014 who foot the majority of the tax bill.\n\nIn Edmonton, for example, homeowners pay about 52 per cent of municipal taxes, while businesses pay 48 per cent. In Vancouver, the split is about 55 per cent residential. And in Ottawa, homeowners pick up 65 per cent of the tab.\n\nIn Vancouver, homeowners pay about 55% of the city taxes. In Calgary, it's businesses that cover most of that tab. (AP Photo/Tourism British Columbia, Albert Normandin)\n\nSo, businesses in Calgary still pay a larger share of municipal taxes than businesses in other cities. But, when compared to what they used to pay, their share of the total burden is shrinking.\n\nNow, before we go on: this is an \"on-average\" sort of thing. Individual businesses will face different situations. But we're looking at the overall situation here.\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering: What about those headlines? The ones about Calgary's \"soaring\" business tax rates?\n\nThey're not technically wrong.\n\nThe key here is the word rate. The tax rate has gone up for businesses, even while the share of actual dollars paid has gone down.\n\nAnd this is where things get really interesting.\n\nTax rate up, tax share down\n\nOne big reason for the tax rate increase is the declining value of commercial properties \u2014 particularly downtown office buildings, which continue to sit largely vacant and thus, are less valuable.\n\nBack in 2015, the total value of downtown offices was assessed at about $24 billion.\n\nBy 2019, the city expects this will have plunged to roughly $12 billion.\n\nThis massive decline has acted like an anchor \u2014 dragging down the entire commercial tax base.\n\nThe total value of all commercial properties in Calgary was $71.8 billion in 2015. That has fallen steadily over the past three years, hitting $65.3 billion in 2018.\n\nThe value of residential properties, meanwhile, has grown slightly over that same time, from $209.3 billion to $214.8 billion.\n\nThe thing about property taxes is that as values go down, the rate must go up \u2014 simply for the city to collect the same amount of money as it did the year before. (Not to mention any increases.) Hence, the \"soaring\" tax rates on businesses.\n\nBut wait! There's more.\n\nBusiness tax phase-out\n\nRight now, Calgary charges two different taxes on businesses.\n\nIn addition to the non-residential property tax, commercial enterprises are also subject to a separate business tax.\n\nThe city started phasing this second tax out in 2014. At the same time, it has been increasing its non-residential property tax by a corresponding amount. This process of consolidation will wrap up in 2019, at which point the business tax will be fully eliminated and absorbed into the non-residential tax.\n\nThis makes no difference in terms of actual dollars, but it magnifies the appearance of recent increases in the non-residential property tax rate.\n\nThat rate has grown by 43 per cent since 2015, which sounds like a lot. But, at the same time, the business tax rate has fallen by 72 per cent.\n\nIt probably helps to look at it in terms of actual dollars, though.\n\nYou can see that in the chart below. (That shrinking brown blob at the top is the business tax.)\n\nIn terms of total taxes (non-residential property tax plus business tax), businesses are paying about 10 per cent more now than they were in 2015.\n\nHomeowners, meanwhile, are paying 13 per cent more.\n\nAnd this is what's behind the slow shift in tax burden from businesses to homeowners: The amount of money the city collects from residential properties has been growing slightly faster \u2014 in terms of actual dollars \u2014 than the amount of money it collects from businesses.\n\nAgain, this is across all taxpayers in the city. There will be plenty of examples of individual businesses that have had an actual increase in real-dollar terms. And some \u2014specifically, those who have seen their property values increase the most \u2014 will have been hit by huge tax increases.\n\nWhich brings us back to that tax relief program.\n\n'Band-Aid' solutions and zero-sum games\n\nCalgary officially calls its tax-relief effort for suburban businesses a \"phased tax program\" but some members of city council have taken to calling it a \"Band-Aid solution.\"\n\nIt may ease the pain in the short term, they say, but using city reserve funds to limit tax increases for certain businesses isn't sustainable in the long term. And it doesn't address the root causes of the massive increases facing business owners who have been primarily responsible for picking up the slack left by the sagging downtown-office sector.\n\n\"At some point we have to determine how we're going to address this structurally,\" Mayor Naheed Nenshi said last week. \"And the answer is not put it all on the residential property tax base.\"\n\nThe problem is, there aren't a heck of a lot of other answers. At least, not easy ones.\n\nThat's because property taxes are essentially a zero-sum game, meaning the less one person (or group) pays, the more everyone else must pay.\n\n\"It's the unfortunate position that cities are in,\" said Arcand, with the Conference Board.\n\n\"There's pressure to keep the business tax low but at the same time they want to make sure that they're not overburdening their residential taxpayers.\"\n\nOne could make the case, though, that residential taxpayers are currently underburdened. (Insert angry outburst here.)\n\nThe Calgary Chamber has certainly made an argument for a reduced tax rate on the city's business community, relative to what homeowners pay.\n\nIndeed, as we've seen, Calgary homeowners \u2014 compared to other cities \u2014 have paid relatively less tax when it comes to the business-residential split.\n\nThis has been largely thanks to that once-mighty downtown office sector, said Richard White, who served as executive director of the Calgary Downtown Association from 1995 to 2006.\n\nThat was a time of nearly constant growth in the city's core, White said, with Calgary averaging one new office tower per year. As a result of all that construction, the city's tax rolls grew just as quickly.\n\n\"We had this golden goose downtown for many, many years,\" he said.\n\n\"An office building generates more tax per square foot than any other type of property assessment.\"\n\nBut White believes it will be a decade, at least, before office construction picks up again in downtown Calgary. In the meantime, he said, \"the city really has to rethink\" how it will make up that source of revenue.\n\nWill homeowners be expected to pick up more of that slack? White wouldn't be surprised.\n\nBut council, ultimately, will have to decide.\n\nCalgary: The Road Ahead is CBC Calgary's special focus on our city as it passes through the crucible of the downturn: the challenges we face, and the possible solutions as we explore what kind of Calgary we want to create.

How would this be operationalized?\" Allard said. \"And so that's the meeting that happened this morning, and expecting a report back to the full [transit advisory committee] so we can have a full discussion.\"\n\nWinnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said he was pleased to see dialogue around the Bear Clan but he'd like to hear from the transit advisory committee before arranging anything formally.\n\n38 operator assaults so far this year: city\n\nViolence on Winnipeg buses has been in the public eye since transit driver Fraser's death in February 2017. His death was followed by a series of initiatives by the city to improve bus safety, including improved audio and video surveillance, bus inspectors and a two-day de-escalation training for bus drivers.\n\nLast year, 51 transit operator assaults were reported to the city, according to a spokesperson. The majority \u2014 46 of them \u2014 were \"Level One\" incidents, in which the assailant applied force, attempted to apply force or made a threat.\n\nFour of them involved the use or threat of a weapon to cause bodily harm and one of them was an aggravated assault.\n\nSo far this year, city numbers show 38 operator assaults, with 36 \"Level One\" incidents and two instances involving the use or threat of a weapon before Oct. 10.\n\nRandy Tonnellier, operations manager at Winnipeg Transit, said he's in favour of anything that makes the city's buses safer. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\nRandy Tonnellier, manager of operations for Winnipeg Transit, said he's \"cautiously optimistic\" about the numbers.\n\nTonnellier said he hadn't been updated on the outcome of the Bear Clan's meeting with transit advisory committee representatives.\n\n\"But I'm definitely in favour of anything we can do to enhance safety in any way for our passengers and for our employees as well,\" he said.\"\n\n'Don't want to take from the taxpayer': Favel\n\nFavel said Bear Clan Patrol members receive thorough training. Examples include how to recognize a drug overdose, administer the overdose treatment drug Naloxone, first aid and CPR, use of a defibrillator and dementia awareness.\n\nOne of their most recent sessions was delivered by Winnipeg police and covered tactical communication, which Favel said is essentially non-violent crisis intervention training.\n\nWalking patrols and board members are insured, he said. They are non-confrontational and non-violent. There would be no expectation or mandate to physically intervene in the way the off-duty member did on Sunday, which Favel said was an extreme case.\n\n\"When there are innocent people at risk, you can count on Bear Clan members stepping up to come to their aid,\" Favel said. \"And that's what I can guarantee.\"\n\nIf his idea moves forward, free passage on the bus for members in their uniform, or potentially carrying an ID card, would be preferable to free bus passes, Favel added. A stack of free bus passes would cost the city, and Favel said he doesn't want to do that.\n\n\"I don't want to take from the taxpayer for us to do what we're already doing,\" he said.\n\n\"If it was as simple as \u2026 getting on the bus in our Bear Clan gear, if we could produce an ID card that had a commencement date and a renewal date on it and show that this volunteer's in good standing and they would be allowed to travel for free \u2014 that would be fantastic.\"", "The judge overseeing Dennis Oland's retrial for the 2011 murder of his father,Richard is highly regarded among lawyers and considered a solid choice to handle the complex case, which has already tripped up one of New Brunswick's most experienced criminal jurists.\n\n\"I think he's probably a very good judge for the Oland trial,\" said Hartland lawyer Peter Hyslop of Justice Terrence Morrison.\n\nHyslop once opposed Morrison at utilities board hearings a dozen years ago when the two were lawyers and later appeared before him following his judicial appointment in 2008.\n\n\"Patient is the word that first comes to me. He's very thorough and takes his time and is a pleasure to appear in front of.\"\n\nFinding judges to handle the two Oland trials has not been a simple matter.\n\nThe Oland family is so prominent in the Saint John area, none of the judges who normally handle local murder trials have been able to take the case.\n\nJustice John (Jack) Walsh was brought to Saint John from Miramichi to handle the first trial in 2015.\n\nThat resulted in a jury finding Dennis Oland guilty, but the Court of Appeal threw the conviction out, citing an error in Walsh's jury instructions.\n\nCourt of Queen's Bench Justice John (Jack) Walsh, who presided over Dennis Oland's first trial, is one of the country's foremost experts in the legal application of forensic DNA typing. (Andrew Robson)\n\nMorrison has been imported from Fredericton to run the second trial.\n\nA 1978 graduate of Acadia University, Morrison obtained a law degree from the University of New Brunswick three years later. He worked as a lawyer in private practice for 26 years, mostly in Fredericton, before becoming a judge but far from the murder and mayhem of criminal court.\n\nHe specialized instead in the high-rent legal areas of commercial, contract and administrative law.\n\nThat's a big difference from Walsh. He came to the Oland trial immersed in criminal matters after a long career as a Crown prosecutor, but he still made enough of an error in his lengthy charge to the jury to scuttle the entire first trial.\n\nHyslop said properly managing the information that reaches a jury in a trial of someone charged with a serious crime is notoriously tricky even for the most experienced judges.\n\n\"A justice once told me criminal trials are the most challenging because of the nature of decisions they have to make during the trial itself on the admissibility of evidence and on making a carefully planned summation to juries,\" said Hyslop.\n\n\"The ultimate decision doesn't rest with the judge. A lot of the decisions that have to be made on the way to the conclusion are made by the judge and they have to made expeditiously.\"\n\nHandled 2nd-degree murder trial in 2014\n\nStill for Morrison, 10 years on the bench, first in Woodstock and more recently in Fredericton, has served to expose him to a variety of criminal trials, including sex crimes, drug offences, assaults and at least one other brutal murder.\n\nIn 2014, he sentenced Kyle Scott for the vicious bludgeoning death of 82-year-old Sarah Kennedy near Woodstock. Kennedy had tried to help Scott after his ATV broke down near her home and he repaid the kindness by striking her 19 times with a hammer and cutting her throat after she died.\n\n\"The killing was random and senseless,\" said Morrison as he sentenced Scott, who had pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, the same charge facing Dennis Oland.\n\nCiting the \"multiple hammer blows delivered to Ms. Kennedy and the deliberate mutilation of her corpse,\" Morrison said he considered Scott's actions \"much further along the spectrum of brutality\" than previous cases he was being asked to compare it to.\n\nHe sentenced the 20-year-old to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for 15 years, five years longer than defence lawyers argued was appropriate.\n\nDiligent, conscientious\n\nIt has all been more than enough to prepare Morrison to handle the Oland trial. according UNB associate law professor Nicole O'Byrne.\n\n\"The learning curve is extraordinarily steep,\" said O'Byrne of the education corporate and civil law lawyers undergo as judges suddenly dealing with the gritty world of criminal acts and their ugly consequences.\n\nO'Byrne has no doubt Morrison will be up to the task.\n\nIt will be difficult, but anybody who's got a reputation of being as conscientious and hard-working as Justice Morrison \u2014 they will be able to handle it. - Nicole O'Byrne , associate law professor\n\n\"It comes down to work ethic and how conscientious you are and how much you pay attention to what's happening in front of you \u2014 that's the key thing to being a judge, not necessarily your background,\" she said.\n\n\"His reputation is of being a very diligent and very conscientious judge. He's there to kind of guide things. It will be difficult, but anybody who's got a reputation of being as conscientious and hard-working as Justice Morrison \u2014 they will be able to handle it.\"\n\nMorrison has a lengthy record of decisions and most that have been challenged at the New Brunswick Court of Appeal have held up to scrutiny.\n\nIn one case where a jury verdict of guilty in a trial presided over by Morrison was thrown out as \"a miscarriage of justice,\" the Appeal Court specifically noted the fault was not his.\n\nMiramichi lawyer George Martin was convicted by a jury of obstruction of justice at a trial in 2013, but subsequent to the verdict it was learned sheriff's deputies had allowed one juror to make a phone call after being sequestered without informing Morrison or seeking his permission.\n\n\"The error or irregularity alleged in the present case cannot amount to an error of law, because none of it can be attributed to the trial judge,\" said the court prior to granting Martin a new trial.\n\nDennis Oland's retrial for second-degree murder in the killing of his father, Richard Oland, more than seven years ago is scheduled to begin on Nov. 6. (CBC)\n\nMorrison is also used to media attention.\n\nHe is best known for the years he spent as outside legal counsel for NB Power during various hearings before the former Public Utilities Board.\n\nHe helped present the case in favour of refurbishing the Coleson Cove generating station to burn the Venezuelan fuel orimulsion and of rebuilding the Point Lepreau nuclear plant to extend its life by 25 years.\n\nHe also won approval from the utilities board for a hefty 8.8 per cent NB Power rate increase in 2006 following marathon hearings at which he was opposed at every step by Hyslop, who at the time was New Brunswick's public intervener.\n\n\"A lot of time you come out of those with somewhat of a dislike for opposing counsel so I'd have to say I came out with a very high level of respect for him at the time,\" said Hyslop, who notes a friendship that developed in those early years was of no detectable assistance following Morrison's elevation to the bench.\n\n\"He found against me too often, but I didn't appeal so that probably tells you more than anything else. I don't think I ever appealed any of his cases,\" said Hyslop.", "The Canadian Coast Guard plans to squeeze another five years of service, and maybe more, out of the oldest vessel in its fleet.\n\nThe 55-year-old science vessel Hudson is one more example of the uncertainty surrounding Canada's shipbuilding program.\n\nCCGS Hudson was supposed to be replaced as early as 2014 as part of the National Shipbuilding Strategy. But the project to build the replacement at Vancouver's Seaspan shipyard still has no budget, confirmed construction start date or timeline for completion.\n\nIn the meantime, the Hudson is now expected to be in service until 2023 and possibly longer.\n\n\"At least, yes,\" said Mario Pelletier, the coast guard's deputy commissioner. \"As we get closer to those dates we will look and \u2026 see if we need the ship around for a bit longer. We'll look at the work that needs to be done.\"\n\nThe goal, he said, is to keep the Hudson in operation until a new offshore oceanographic science vessel is delivered.\n\n2017 refit suddenly cancelled\n\nThe coast guard's intention to extend the life of the ship was revealed in documents obtained by CBC News in an access-to-information request into the previous, and botched, dry-dock refit of the Hudson last year.\n\nThe maintenance project at Heddle Marine in Hamilton, Ont., was abruptly ended by the federal government in October 2017.\n\nThe $4-million refit was five months behind schedule and still unfinished when the government towed the Hudson out of the shipyard rather than risk having it trapped for months by the winter closure of the St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nScientists on board CCGS Hudson recently discovered an intact coral reef off Nova Scotia believed to have been destroyed. (DFO photo)\n\nGenerations of scientists on board the 90-metre-long Hudson have gathered a wide range of scientific data on ocean conditions in the Atlantic and Arctic.\n\nIn recent years the ship has documented abnormally warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic, a potentially important indicator of climate change.\n\n'Resetting the clock' on an aging ship\n\nThe coast guard is hoping a planned refit this winter will allow the Hudson to obtain regulatory approvals to keep it in service for another five-year cycle.\n\n\"What we are doing is resetting the clock and make sure she can last for the next five years, safely and reliably,\" Pelletier said.\n\nReplacing the Hudson has been a sliding target since a new science vessel was promised by the Harper government in 2011.\n\nBy 2013, coast guard officials were predicting a replacement would be sailing in 2017. The cost then was estimated at $144 million.\n\nThe most recent federal government update on the project has a new vessel in service by late 2021 or early 2022. The budget, pegged at $331 million, is under review.\n\nAnother 5-10 years of service\n\nAfter the Hudson was removed from the Heddle Marine shipyard last year, coast guard manager Clifford Harvey wrote to an inspector for Lloyd's Register, the U.K.-based classification society that certifies seaworthiness.\n\n\"We are doing forward planning for the Hudson and I would like you to confirm that you don't see any obstacles to continued service beyond the next five-year inspection cycle based on what you saw in the yard during the recent refit,\" Harvey said in an Oct. 11, 2017 email.\n\nThe Lloyd's official \u2014 whose name is blocked out \u2014 replied that provided appropriate repairs are completed \"there is no reason why the vessel should not continue to operate for another 5-10 years.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much for the detailed answer, this is exactly what we were looking for,\" Harvey responded.\n\nSeaspan ready to start next project\n\nDavid Perry of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute is not surprised by the developments.\n\nHe said the timing of the Hudson replacement was thrown further into doubt earlier this year when Ottawa announced construction would soon begin on the Royal Canadian Navy joint-support vessel at Seaspan.\n\nSeaspan was supposed to build the new offshore oceanographic science vessel first.\n\n\"It would seem the joint-support ship and the navy project is a bit more mature and ready to go,\" said Perry.\n\n\"If they are saying they are not expecting it (Hudson replacement) until 2023-24, that may mean it will come after the joint-support ships.\"\n\nThe CCGS Hudson was towed to the Canada Centre for Inland Waters in Burlington, Ont., last year after months of delays. (CBC/Adam Carter)\n\nHe said the coast guard is being prudent to keep the Hudson on the water, but added he doesn't believe it's ideal to do \"another refit and life extension on a ship that is that old.\"\n\nAn old ship shows its age\n\nAt 55, the Hudson is showing its age.\n\nWhen opened up for its 2017 refit, the shipyard discovered it had a badly cracked stern tube carrying the ship's propeller, according to documents released to the CBC.\n\nThe ensuing welding job added weeks to the project.\n\nThe ship's lifeboat was in such poor condition it was condemned.\n\nIn an effort to speed up the refit, coast guard crew members were pressed into service at the shipyard \u2014 and put up at local hotels.\n\nA number of work items, including the installation of a new fuel-monitoring system and pipes for the engine room, were deferred until the next refit, or cancelled.\n\nMario Pelletier is the Canadian Coast Guard's deputy commissioner. (CBC)\n\nPelletier said this type of juggling is routine when refits uncover equipment in poor repair.\n\n\"So we need to prioritize some of the work,\" he said.\n\nConstruction expected in 2019\n\nThe coast guard said construction of the new vessel is expected to begin in 2019.\n\n\"The build contract is being negotiated which will determine the project schedule and ultimately the delivery date,\" Benoit Mayrand of coast guard communications said in a statement.\n\nNicolas Insley, Seaspan communications manager, added the contract will determine the cost and timeline for the vessel.\n\nNext Hudson refit\n\nContracts for the upcoming winter refit of the Hudson will be released in the coming weeks. The ship will be unavailable for science missions until late spring.\n\nThe Department of Fisheries and Oceans will charter a private vessel for that work.\n\nDFO is taking no chances should the Hudson refit run late. It is asking candidates for an option to keep the vessel to maintain science programming if the Hudson is unavailable.\n\n\"That's always a safe thing to do if ships are available but our intent is to have the Hudson back in service for next summer to deliver the program in a reliable fashion for the next five years,\" Pelletier said.", "Waves of Change is a CBC series exploring the single-use plastic we're discarding, and why we need to clean up our act. You can be part of the community discussion by joining our Facebook group.\n\nHalifax restaurateur Bill Pratt is still waiting for a two-year supply of biodegradable paper straws he ordered three months ago to show up.\n\nTrying to source a paper straw that doesn't turn to mush after 30 minutes in a drink is a challenge, he admits, but one that he and others in the business are trying to meet as more and more customers demand eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics.\n\n\"The demand has gone through the roof,\" says Pratt, founder and director of Chef Inspired Group of Restaurants. The Dartmouth, N.S.-based company includes Habaneros and Cheese Curds restaurants as well as a number of food trucks.\n\nA number of big chains and local restaurants are phasing out plastic straws like these in favour of biodegradable paper options. (Canadian Press)\n\nMany national chains have also taken steps to move away from single-use plastics \u2014 a shift that's largely customer-driven.\n\nRecipe Unlimited is Canada's largest full-service restaurant company with brands including Swiss Chalet, Harvey's, New York Fries, Montana's BBQ & Bar, and East Side Mario's. It started phasing out plastic straws in August, with the aim of having them all gone by March 2019.\n\nTheir Prime Pubs brand has already eliminated plastic straws at their locations, including Fionn MacCool's.\n\n\"Our customers across different brands have been asking, can we do something, can we make a change, and try to make a difference,\" says Maureen Hart, senior director of communications and corporate affairs at Recipe Unlimited.\n\n\"I can say so far, the feedback has been great.\"\n\nPaper straws on request\n\nGoing forward, Hart says paper straws will be available upon request, though she hopes customers will ultimately opt to go straw-free.\n\nThe challenge, she points out, is a growing trend toward takeout and delivery, with companies like Uber Eats offering a broader service of delivery from restaurants. Customers want less packaging and waste \u2014 but they also want their food to go.\n\n\"To look at reduction strategies makes it challenging when the behaviour is going in the opposite direction,\" she says.\n\nRecipe Unlimited has heard from customers who want to bring their own containers when collecting takeout orders, but that introduces another problem, which is food safety.\n\n\"We can't stand behind the cleanliness of that packaging,\" says Hart. \"It just brings up a whole other area of concern for a larger restaurant company like ours. We wouldn't want to compromise quality.\"\n\nInstead, the company is looking at possible replacements for its single-use plastic packaging, takeout containers, cutlery, and cups.\n\nBill Pratt is the founder and director of Chef Inspired Group of Restaurants, a Dartmouth, N.S.-based company. (Robert Short/CBC)\n\nHowever, as Pratt has discovered, many options are more expensive and not all customers are on board with the change.\n\nChef Inspired introduced wooden, biodegradable cutlery in its restaurants years ago, but now offers both wooden and plastic options due to a negative reaction.\n\n\"We get a lot of complaints about the wooden cutlery, people feel like it's a tongue depressor when you're eating,\" says Pratt. His company also uses biodegradable takeout containers, which he says are made of sugarcane, but cost three times more than plastic.\n\nMunicipal rules vary across Canada\n\nAnother challenge is offering containers that might be recyclable in one jurisdiction but not in another.\n\nThe inconsistencies in Canadian municipal recycling rules is on the radar at McDonald's, according to the restaurant's public relations manager, Kristen Hunter. She says the company has plans to tackle that issue.\n\n\"We understand that recycling infrastructure, regulations and consumer behaviours vary from city to city, but we plan to be part of the solution and help influence powerful change,\" Hunter wrote in an email.\n\nWhile customers still choose to dine in, there is a growing trend of takeout and delivery services. (Robert Short/CBC)\n\nMuch of the packaging is fibre-based at McDonald's, but Hunter says the company uses plastic packaging in approximately 20 per cent of its global operations. Earlier this year, the chain announced its goal to source 100 per cent of guest packaging from renewable, recycled, or certified sources by 2025.\n\nPratt wants to see people, businesses and municipalities all get on board and commit to new products in order to help reduce costs.\n\n\"Some cities where I've worked in the past, Fort McMurray for example, have said, no, we don't have any plastic bags,\" he says.\n\n\"It forces everyone to use paper or something reusable. Then the prices come down. That's what's happening with straws right now. There's such a demand, you can't even get them.\"\n\nWith alternatives being developed to respond to this demand, the people at Recipe Unlimited hope to bring changes to their restaurants sooner rather than later.\n\n\"We're definitely open to solutions, if people have ideas we'd love to hear them,\" says Hart. \"We really want to make a difference in this area.\"\n\nChef Inspired introduced wooden, biodegradable cutlery in its Nova Scotia restaurants years ago, but now offers both the wooden and the plastic due to a negative reaction from customers.

In other words, they didn't like what had been written about him, so they wrote their own rebuttal, framing it as a fact-check.\n\nAnd fake fact-checkers are just one example of the proliferation of fake news derivatives; now, even legit fact-checking efforts might be giving fuel to the false narratives.\n\nMedia manipulators\n\nAccording to danah boyd (who spells her name lower case), the founder and president of the research institute Data & Society, the media are being played by those wishing to spread false news.\n\nShe states that media manipulators have developed a predictable \u2014 but successful \u2014 strategy in which, first, they create spectacle, using social media to get news media coverage, which in turn drives new audiences to the story.\n\nCase in point, according to a recent study by Media Matters for America, over the past three weeks, leading newspapers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, have produced more than a hundred news stories referring to the migrant caravan, which the report refers to as President Trump's \"phony crisis,\" claiming he is \"using his bully pulpit to move it to the top of the media agenda.\"\n\nSo what are we to do?\n\nAccording to Lytvynenko, \"one key thing reporters have to do is think about what they amplify and what words they use to do it.\"\n\nA commuter walks past an advertisement last April discouraging the dissemination of fake news, at a train station in Kuala Lumpur.

(J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)\n\nAs of Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said all of the sanctions lifted under Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers had been reimposed, including cutting links from Iran to the international banking system.\n\nPompeo said the sanctions have already cost Iran the sale of more than one million barrels of crude a day, as countries around the world sought new sources of oil.\n\n\"Our objective is to starve the Iranian regime of the revenue it uses to fund violent and destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East and, indeed, around the world,\" Pompeo said. \"The Iranian regime has a choice: It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlawed course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble.\"\n\nWaivers on sanctions for 7 countries\n\nBut also on Monday, the U.S. announced that eight trading partners would be granted waivers to continue buying oil from Iran \u2014 China, Greece, India, Italy, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey.\n\nThis may be a strategy to appease those trading partners and allow them time to develop new sources of oil, but it also may have been done with an eye of the impact on oil prices, Lee said.\n\n\"They don't want to do something too draconian and upset stability in the international oil markets,\" he said.\n\nThe prospect of sanctions has been hanging over the markets and may have worked itself out in September, when the price of the Brent futures contract for oil spiked above $85 US a barrel.\n\nOil prices have retreated since then, as the world's largest oil producers stepped up production, says TD economist Omar Abdelrahman.\n\nRussia, Saudi Arabia and especially the U.S. have boosted output to replace any North American reliance on Iranian oil, he said.\n\nOn Monday, Brent crude rose as high as $74.13 US a barrel in morning trading, but ended the day down two cents at $73.40.\n\nExpect oil price volatility\n\nAbdelrahman expects some oil price volatility in coming months.\n\nBut when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets in December to agree on new production levels, he anticipates its members will have moved to take market share from Iran.\n\nThe wild card, he says, is how long the U.S. maintains those exemptions for the eight buyers of oil from Iran. Currently, they're set to last 180 days.\n\nEven if those customers look elsewhere for oil, it's not likely to do anything for Canadian producers, he said. \"Most of our oil goes to the U.S. Canada doesn't have the market dynamics to sell to India or China.\"\n\nLee says the exemptions will \"mitigate the impact of sanctions\" on Iran.\n\n\"The U.S. wants to isolate Iran.

But should the poppy and the Royal Canadian Legion also be inseparable? That's the status quo now, with the organization holding a monopoly on use of the poppy symbol across Canada.\n\nLast year, the Legion got in a public spat over the use of the poppy with one veteran charity. The charity, Wounded Warriors Canada, partnered with Telus for an online campaign that honoured 117,000 fallen Canadian soldiers. But because the campaign featured a poppy symbol on its website, the Legion demanded the campaign either remove the image or divert the donations to the Legion. Telus ended up donating to both organizations, but replaced the Wounded Warriors Canada logo with the Royal Canadian Legion's.\n\nThis year, the Legion began marketing a sealskin poppy for $50 each, even though the Legion and seal hunters were critical of an Iqaluit artist who created and sold similar poppies back in 2013. Meanwhile, the Legion has partnered with a B.C. brewer to market a beer with the poppy logo prominently displayed on the packaging and can.\n\nPoppy trademark\n\nCanadians might be surprised to learn that the image of the poppy cannot be used in \"any colour or configuration\" for remembrance without the Legion's approval. One assumes, then, that schools, knitters and veterans must ask permission.\n\nCanada's Parliament granted the Legion this powerful trademark in 1948. As the Legion's website explains: \"This vital responsibility was bestowed upon the Legion to ensure that the Canada's largest Veterans organization could act in preserving the Poppy as a sacred symbol of Remembrance of our Veterans.\"\n\nYet the Legion is no longer Canada's largest veterans' organization, having experienced massively dwindling numbers over the last few years. In fact, it is not even a dedicated veterans' organization. Instead, the Legion now labels itself \"Canada's largest Veteran support and community service organization.\"\n\nIf the Legion is no longer the largest dedicated veterans' organization in Canada, nor is it the organization with the most veterans, why does it retain the monopoly on the poppy? (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nThe largest dedicated veterans' organization in Canada today is probably Veterans Canada, which has around 8,000 mostly military veteran members. Even the National Association of Federal Retirees tracks its Canadian Forces (CF) veteran population at about 60,000. The Legion, on the other hand, likely has fewer than 30,000 post-World War II CF veterans.\n\nSo if the Legion is no longer the largest dedicated veterans' organization in Canada, nor is it the organization with the most veterans, why does it retain the monopoly on the poppy? Tradition? The Legion isn't even Canada's oldest veteran organization. That honour goes to the Army, Navy & Air Force Veterans in Canada, which was given a Royal charter in 1840\n\nTrue, the Legion began its poppy campaign in 1921. However, it operated for 27 years without exclusive rights to the poppy. Since that time, it has built up a national mechanism for distributing poppies with more than $16.5 million collected in 2014. At the same time, questions have been raised in some cases about the allocation of those funds, without sufficient answers.\n\nThe Legion's head office, known as Dominion Command, is not a charity and therefore has not been required to provide detailed accounting as to how the poppy funds are specifically distributed. Its \"Poppy Manual,\" however, stresses the organization, would \"ensure that [the poppy] would never be used for commercial or personal gain or would never be desecrated through inappropriate use.\"\n\nYet the Legion markets all sorts of products at poppystore.ca, including cell phone cases, wallets, totes, mittens, toques, umbrellas and even stuffed poppy puppies. In 2013, the Legion further trademarked the use of the poppy on hundreds of other products including lottery tickets, ashtrays, pool cues, hosiery, sweat bands and \"underwear briefs.\"\n\nIt is left to the Legion's discretion to determine when and if the use of the poppy is in bad taste, or if profit overshadows sacrifice and remembrance. No one holds the Legion accountable.\n\nMost if not all Legion members are well-intentioned. But why should the Legion have Canadian exclusivity for this international sacred symbol of sacrifice? Such responsibility should not be entrusted to just one organization, especially one that is not fully accountable to all Canadians. Charities and organizations working to assist veterans and serving members and their families should be able to share this solemn emblem of honour.\n\nThere are ways to maintain the dignity of the poppy image while opening up access of use. Canada could, for example, grant licenses to organizations that wish to use the poppy, complete with standards for allocation of funds. It could also monitor the use of the poppy image to ensure its portrayal is appropriate for such a prominent symbol of sacrifice.\n\nCanada is about equal access, universality and non-discrimination. Everyone should be able to use a symbol that honours those who served for our nation.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

So it allows an athlete to take greater risks in high-risk sports. There are even those who suggest that it adds to an athlete's creativity in sports where creativity may be of some value,\" Melia said.\n\n\"I think a closer look at the scientific literature would suggest it's equivocal when it comes to its performance-enhancing benefit. We've never wanted the Canadian anti-doping program to be used to police recreational drug use by athletes.\"\n\nIn a sport like figure skating, Moscovitch says consuming marijuana would not enhance performance.\n\n\"In our sport, there is so much going on: it's very fast-paced, there's lots of balance involved,\" he said. \"Also in pair skating, you have a relationship with another person on the ice that's relying on you. If you are in another place, they will know right away.\n\n\"If you lost your focus or you forget a specific thing and change your pattern all of a sudden, you're 10 feet from your partner and it ruins the next element and the set up for the one after. It's potentially dangerous.\"\n\nThe medical evidence \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 supports what Moscovitch and Melia are saying about cannabis use.\n\n\"If you look at the potential to enhance sport performance, the reality is the evidence just doesn't exist. There's been a couple of older studies, really only two, that I'm aware of,\" said Dennis Jensen, an associate professor of kinesiology and physical education at McGill University.\n\nWhile it's unclear whether cannabis acts as a performance enhancer, Jensen said there's a danger in imposing restrictions based on anecdotal evidence. He points out that drugs only make it to market after rigorous testing \u2014 and that just hasn't yet happened with cannabis.\n\n\"You don't necessarily take something off a list if it also hasn't undergone rigorous testing,\" he said.\n\n'We don't have the evidence'\n\nMixed martial arts is an example of where marijuana use could be both an advantage and a disadvantage, Jensen suggests.\n\n\"You may have increased confidence, lowering of anxiety that could be potentially performance-enhancing. But if you offset that with slower reaction times, you could argue that you feel better \u2014 but you're slower and you're going to get punched more. So I don't really think, in the end of it all, we know. We don't have the evidence.\"\n\nJensen and his colleagues at McGill recently published a paper exploring cannabis and athletic performance. He expects an influx of similar studies as academics attempt to fill in the blanks and provide strengthened rationale for rules governing cannabis use across all sectors of society, including sports.\n\n\"I think we are in a very prime and timely period to advance this area of research very, very aggressively,\" he said. \"Maybe confirm some of these anecdotal reports or debunk them completely.\"\n\nAthletes like Dylan Moscovitch, from his retirement perch, will be watching.\n\n\"It's going to be very interesting to see how society adjusts its view, whether there is still the same stigma that comes along with it.

The Civil Guard said 13 of the survivors were thought to be unaccompanied minors.\n\nIt also said 17 other people traveling were missing, but could have reached Spanish shores. The Civil Guard on Tuesday resumed the search for them both on sea and land.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Spanish maritime rescuers found 80 people, including five women, and recovered the bodies of 13 dead migrants in the Alboran Sea, part of the western Mediterranean migrant route into Europe.\n\nThe migrants were traveling in two different boats, the Spanish Maritime Rescue Service said, adding that they were all transferred to the Spanish enclave of Melilla, which borders Morocco.\n\nThe United Nations says over 2,160 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe this year, 564 of them trying to reach Spain.\n\nAt the Strait of Gibraltar on the western edge of the Mediterranean, Africa and Europe are only 14 kilometres apart but the waters there can be dangerous due to high winds and strong currents. Still, the short distance has made that route the most popular choice for migrants heading to Europe after fleeing violence or poverty at home.\n\nNearly 54,000 migrants have entered Europe this year through Spain, more than the combined migrant arrivals to Italy and Greece, which had been the most popular migrant destinations in previous years. One-fifth of them arrived in October, the month with most migrant arrivals so far this year, according to UN statistics.", "Jordy Bellerive scored the go-ahead goal midway through the third period and the Western Hockey League selections edged Russia 2-1 on Monday to open the annual Canada-Russia Series.\n\nDylan Cozens put the WHL on the board 14 minutes into the game but Pavel Shen tied it for Russia just 26 seconds later.\n\nBoth goaltenders held tight through the scoreless second period before Bellerive knocked home the winner at 10:31 on the third.\n\nWatch Jordy Bellerive's game-winner:\n\nWestern Hockey League edges Russia 2-1, Jordy Bellerive scores game winner midway through final period 0:24\n\nIan Scott stopped 27 total shots for the WHL team.

Jahan was struck and killed while cycling on Laurier Avenue W. on Sept. 1, 2016.\n\nLawyers for both the defence and Crown made their closing arguments Monday after the evidence portion of the trial finished in July.\n\nIn court, defence lawyer Dominic Lamb played a video from a City of Ottawa traffic camera that he said showed Conley's construction truck approaching the intersection of Laurier Avenue W. and Lyon Street at around 7:47 a.m.\n\nIt was clear, Lamb said, that his client stopped for a red light and only proceeded to turn right onto Lyon Street when the straight green arrow had changed to solid green, indicating it was safe to turn right.\n\nConley didn't see Nusrat, Lamb told the court, because she was in the driver's blind spot.\n\n\"He was driving slowly. He stopped for the red light at the appropriate spot behind the vehicle stop line,\" he said. \"Mr. Conley didn't turn right until there was a solid green signal.\"\n\nLamb told Justice David Berg that the Crown had failed to make its case, arguing his client's only transgression was failing to use his turn signal, which he characterized as a \"minor offence\" under Ontario's Highway Traffic Act.\n\n\"There was a series of tragic events that morning, but to extract from that that his actions posed a danger to the public is not supportable,\" Lamb said.\n\nJahan, 23, was cycling on Laurier Avenue W. to class at Willis College when the truck hit her. (courtesy of family)\n\nNo evidence driver couldn't see cyclist: Crown\n\nCrown prosecutor John Ramsay responded, saying \"no evidence had been presented as why [Conley] did not or could not see her.\"\n\nJahan, he added, was there for \"a long time.\"\n\n\"To suggest the driver had a momentary lapse just doesn't hold weight,\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"When people willfully and wantonly disregard the rules of driving there are consequences,\" he continued. \"There was a disregard to using the turn signal when there was a danger of someone who isn't in a giant cage weighing hundreds and hundreds of pounds, but on a bicycle.\"\n\nRamsay also refuted the defence claim that Conley waited until the green arrow turned to a solid green before starting his right-hand turn.\n\nHe called on the judge to convict the driver on both counts.\n\n\"Mr. Conley made a decision that day that raises it to the level of criminal content,\" Ramsay said. \"It is a tragedy, but the negligence goes beyond what's in the Highway Traffic Act.\"\n\nThe Crown's case received a blow earlier in the trial when Berg tossed out most evidence from an Ottawa police collision investigator who testified Conley would have clearly seen the cyclist before he turned right. The re-enactment of the crash \u2014 played in court earlier in the trial \u2014 contained several major errors.\n\nThe judge is expected to hand down his decision on Feb. 5, 2019.", "Without Kawhi Leonard, the Raptors used a balanced team effort to get their fourth straight win.\n\n\"We have been playing basically position-less basketball,\" said Kyle Lowry, who had 17 points and 11 assists to lead four Raptors with 17 points as Toronto beat the Utah Jazz 124-111 on Monday night.\n\nSerge Ibaka, OG Anunoby and Fred VanVleet also had 17 points as the Raptors were bolstered with six players in double figures to win their fourth straight game.\n\n\"Tonight was how our offence is supposed to be played,\" VanVleet said. \"As long as we're making shots, their defence has to respect the shooters and it allows us to play with more freedom out there.\"\n\nLowry leads balanced attack by Raptors:\n\nToronto beats Utah 124-11. Kyle Lowry records 10 assists or more for the 9th straight game. 1:47\n\nThe matchup lost some shine \u2014 and nearly 49 points a game \u2014 when Utah's Donovan Mitchell was ruled out with a left ankle sprain and Toronto's Leonard sat with a sore left ankle as well.\n\nBut the Raptors didn't miss a beat and their offensive spacing left the court wide-open for drives.\n\n\"Nobody likes to play in tight spaces, in congested spaces, so with an offence full of shooters, it's open and it's fun out there,\" VanVleet said.\n\nIbaka made all eight of his shots and has made 27 of his last 29 attempts.\n\nRaptors on fire\n\n\"The guy is hot,\" Lowry said of Ibaka but he could have said it about a half-dozen Raptors. The point guard is certainly finding his shooters and has now posted nine consecutive games with 10 or more assists.\n\nAlec Burks led Utah with 22 points and Rudy Gobert had 14 points and 12 rebounds. After the game, Burks was so disgusted he said he had nothing to say to the media despite his scoring outburst.\n\nThe Raptors broke the game open with a 15-3 run that bridged the second and third quarter.

Michael McLaughlin.\n\nHe said the investigation into the complaint is considered complete and barring new evidence, further charges are unlikely.\n\n\"While we're aware of allegations of quite a large sum of money or copper that was sold, we did not find evidence to support that in a criminal court,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nHe called the alleged crime an unusual one because most metal theft involves stealing public art pieces or wire from infrastructure.\n\n\"It was an allegation of internal theft, workplace theft. Really, there's not a lot police can do about that,\" he said.\n\n\"When it comes to a workplace there is an expectation that an owner or a business or city must put processes in place, so this can be avoided in the future.\"\n\nCity says oversight improved\n\nPort Coquitlam's director of human resources, Steve Traviss, said the city has made changes since firing the seven employees.\n\nOversight has been improved, he said, by installing superintendents in supervisory roles. He said that having unionized employees supervising other union members led to \"inherent conflict.\"\n\nPublic works managers are also more closely tracking valuable metals like copper and brass when they are recycled.\n\n\"We took decisive action and made some hard decisions \u2026 that should hopefully give the public some assurance that we are taking these matters very seriously,\" Traviss said.\n\n\"We are doing everything we can to make sure they don't happen again.\"\n\nThe seven employees fired over the alleged metal theft have filed grievances over their terminations. A third-party arbitrator will hear their arguments at a later date.\n\nLewis is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Dec. 3. The charge against him has not been tested in court.\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press", "Her doctors told her it might be bronchitis or pneumonia, but all Sarah Rosolen knew was that she'd never felt that sick before.\n\nAnd then it got worse.\n\nIn June in Fort Smith, N.W.T., Rosolen realized her illness was more than just a lung infection. Flash forward to now, five months later. Rosolen's living in Edmonton, at Sorrentino's Compassion House, a residence for women from out of town (or, in Rosolen's case, out of province) undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nRosolen is 1,300 kilometres away from her home and her family. But she's found a new family just when she needs it most.\n\nNo simple infection\n\n\"I got this splitting pain in my back. I couldn't sleep, my lungs were so heavy and I was seriously propping myself up to try to sleep,\" Rosolen said, remembering the symptoms that made her and her partner Dave Porter take action.\n\n\n\nSarah reads to her son Bowan at home in Fort Smith before her diagnosis. (Submitted by Sarah Rosolen) After a trip to the emergency room late that night, doctors in Fort Smith decided to send Rosolen for further tests at a larger hospital in Yellowknife, about 800 kilometres away.\n\nAfter going through a CT scan, Rosolen \"heard the [doctors] talking outside of the curtain and they said '47-year-old woman, healthy, mass in the interstitium.'\"\n\nThe medical team eventually revealed that she had a 10-centimetre tumour on her chest that was impacting her lungs and heart. They told Rosolen the situation was urgent, and she had to be flown out immediately for a biopsy at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton, Alta., nearly 1,500 kilometres away.\n\nIn a daze, Rosolen called Porter back home in Fort Smith.\n\n\"He answered the phone right away and I remember saying, 'Are you sitting down?'\" Rosolen said.\n\nPorter was out cutting wood when he got the call.\n\n\"She said, 'I have cancer and I'm about to go into surgery,'\" Porter recalled.\n\nStunned, he went into planning mode, trying to organize how the blended family of seven was going to manage this bombshell.\n\nTo get a rest from cancer treatment in Edmonton, Sarah Rosolen and partner Dave Porter enjoy a family day-trip to Sylvan Lake, Alta. (Submitted by Sarah Rosolen)\n\nPorter's first priority was to get to Edmonton so that he could be there when Rosolen awoke from her surgery. So, Porterpacked up the car and set out on the 13-hour drive with Rosolen's seven-year-old son, Bowan.\n\nDespite the spotty cell service, he did his best to stay in contact with the hospital in Yellowknife, where Rosolen remained, having not been airlifted to Edmonton yet.\n\nAt the crossroads\n\nAfter a couple of hours on the road, Porter came to the tiny crossroads town of Enterprise, N.W.T.\n\nTurning right takes drivers to Yellowknife, while turning left takes you onto the highway toward Edmonton.\n\nI got a text message and it said, 'You need to come to Yellowknife, Sarah's not going to make it.' - Dave Porter\n\nAt this crossroads, Porter got a devastating text message about Rosolen's condition.\n\n\"It said, 'Don't go to Edmonton, you need to come to Yellowknife, Rosolen's not going to make it,'\" he recalled.\n\n\"We get to the crossroads\u2026 and which way do you go? I have her boy in the back seat and this isn't going well.\"\n\nFor a few moments, Porter believed his partner was dead. Back at the Yellowknife hospital, Rosolen's heart stopped while the staff were prepping her for the flight to Edmonton.\n\nEventually they brought her back to life, and decided she was stable enough to make the long flight.\n\nThe good news finally made it to Porter, so he turned left at the crossroads and continued on the road to Edmonton.\n\nIt took a couple of weeks to get a confirmed diagnosis, but finally doctors in Edmonton told Rosolen that she had a rare form of cancer called acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.\n\nBowan and Sarah enjoy taking pictures together and talking about happy memories during their visits. (Submitted by Sarah Rosolen)\n\nChoosing Compassion\n\nRosolen's treatment is expected to take two and a half years. The first couple of phases include heavy doses of chemotherapy multiple times a week, which means she couldn't go home to Fort Smith.\n\n\"My treatments are three or four hours a day. Sometimes all day,\" she said.\n\nPorter made plans for Rosolen to stay with his family near Edmonton, but she was having second thoughts, given how gruelling the treatment might become.\n\n\"I can't imagine being in somebody else's house being so sick,\" she said. \"I didn't know what this [treatment] was going to be, and it has been rough at times.\"\n\nRenting an apartment or staying at a hotel was going to be too expensive. Then, Rosolen happened upon a list that the hospital had made of possible accommodations for patients.\n\nThat's when Rosolen first saw the words \"Sorrentino's Compassion House.\"\n\n\"There was a website and I looked at it and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this place is beautiful!'\" she said.\n\nSorrentino's Compassion House is run by a foundation to give women an affordable and comfortable place to stay while undergoing active cancer treatment in Edmonton. It's less expensive than hotels and short-term rentals. The only stipulation is that women must live at least 50 kilometres from the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Porter and son Bowan had to go back home to Fort Smith. Porter had to work, and Bowan had to return to his school and his routine.\n\nSarah missed her hammock from home in Fort Smith, so a Compassion House staff member brought one for Sarah to use. (Submitted by Sarah Rosolen)\n\nLife at the house has been a transformative experience for Rosolen. Soon after moving in, she realized the women there were a support system she didn't know she needed.\n\n\"Some people have had real challenges with their family not understanding or not accepting their choices,\" said Rosolen. \"Some people make a choice [about treatment] and their family gets upset\u2026 and they're intervening. That's really hard on people.\"\n\nRosolen said although the women in the house have varying types of cancer, they understand exactly what everyone else is going through.\n\nSarah Rosolen (second from left) with her newfound family in the Compassion House kitchen. (Tanara McLean/CBC)\n\n\"They're all know when you're having a bad day, and we're all happy if somebody is having a good day,\" she said.\n\nThough Porter was worried about Rosolen being alone, he now realizes that the companionship of the Compassion House residents is powerful medicine. \"When you're surrounded and supported by others who have a sense of how it's feeling \u2014 physically, emotionally, mentally \u2014 that's so important that they're able to have each other to lean on,\" he said.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nRosolen said knowing she's got a house full of women who are there to provide empathy and support makes even the worst days bearable.\n\nShe's on track to check out of the house in mid-February 2019. \"I feel very lucky. I'm very cognizant of the fact that I almost died, and I feel like I have a second chance,\" she said.\n\n\"Having cancer changes your perspective and I'm more grateful for every day. I feel gratitude, and I choose to be happy.\"\n\nBowan dabs while visiting mom Sarah Rosolen at Sorrentino's Compassion House.

Then, Corbett, three other conservation officers, a contract houndsman and several dogs were dispatched to find the bear and kill it.\n\nThe group tracked the bear to a swamp deep in the bush. Then, Corbett said, another officer spotted it about 20 metres away and yelled out.\n\nThe bear first charged at the hounds but then turned to Corbett, he said. Aiming from the hip, he got off a quick shot with his rifle but couldn't slow it down.\n\nThe bear was on him. He said he tried to protect himself with his left hand, which the bear began biting.\n\nHe drew his pistol with his right.

He was considerate.

(Chantal Bellrichard/CBC)\n\nThe coroner's jury heard that Hirsi had been depressed and stressed in 2015, so his sister bought him a ticket to his favourite city, Vancouver. And his mother gave him $2,000 she'd saved for him.\n\nHirsi's mother said when her son got to Vancouver somebody stole his cell phone, his wallet and his money. She believes he was trying to get his belongings back.\n\n\"He happened to be naive in trying to retrieve what had been stolen from him,\" she said. \"It happened to be the event that ended his life.\"\n\nHirsi's friend, Dunia Nur, sat in the inquest helping the family of women, heads bent into handkerchiefs.\n\nShe said she felt compelled to attend in memory of her friend and out of frustration at how many black men end up shot by police in North America.\n\nShe said that Hirsi was a gifted basketball player who aspired to become a professional, driven to support his own hard-working mother.\n\nLost a leader\n\n\"This is very scary.

(Erin Collins/CBC)\n\n\"The building is already provincially designated, so that meant it couldn't be torn down,\" Traptow said.\n\n\"In terms of municipally designating it, the City of Calgary and the legion signed a lease in 1919 that exempted it from municipal tax. That lease expires next year, and so as part of extending that lease for another hundred years \u2026 it will be protected, in perpetuity.\n\n\"They'll get their exemption from property tax and will also have the ability to access the City of Calgary's municipal heritage grant program, as well as sell any unused density that the legion has.\"\n\n'Unused density' for sale\n\nTraptow also explained the concept of 'unused density'.\n\n\"In layman's terms, if that site was zoned to 15 storeys, they could sell their density, above their two stories, to another site in the Beltline. The program's available to any municipally designated resource in the downtown. Iit allows them to take use of whatever density they're zoned for, and they're able to sell that density.\n\n\"So they get an infusion of cash, which allows them to continue to maintain and operate the building, but make use of whatever density they have. It's a great program to encourage keeping heritage buildings.\"\n\nBeing designated by the city doesn't change anything for the legion, which was originally built in 1922 as a gathering place for veterans returning from fighting in the First World War.\n\nHowever, Traptow said that if the legion wanted to pitch the city on the idea of developing part of the building as a brewpub, there might be some interest.\n\n\"It would all depend what portions of building are regulated. I think there are some parts of the interior that are regulated. All of the outside is regulated \u2014 but I'm sure the city and the province would work with them if they wanted to put in a microbrewery or whatever.\"\n\nA motion is being brought forward by Coun. Druh Farrell to give the Legion its municipal heritage resource designation, which Traptow didn't anticipate anyone protesting.\n\nOver the years, the Legion has morphed from being a gathering place for veterans into being a multi-purpose venue, Traptow added.\n\n\"The legion still hosts weddings, legion events, wrestling, rock concerts \u2014 it still is very much part of the fabric of the downtown community,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it's also a treasured part of the city's past.\n\n\"Calgary has such a rich military past, that it's great to see it becoming a municipal historic resource, in addition to already being a province historic resource,\" he said.\n\nWith files from the Calgary Eyeopener", "The European Union has recalled its ambassador to Tanzania, citing \"the deterioration of the human rights and rule of law situation\" in the East African country where one regional official last week called for the outing and arrests of gay people.\n\nA statement emailed to The Associated Press Monday said the EU will be conducting a broad review of its relations with Tanzania.\n\nThe statement does not cite specific issues, but there are fears of an impending crackdown against gays after Dar es Salaam Commissioner Paul Makonda urged Tanzanians to spy on suspected gays and lesbians and to report their activities.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EUinTZ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EUinTZ</a> Ambassador Roeland van de Geer, has been recalled to Brussels for consultations which began today.

They say they found some loose change in the original security budget, to end up with $495 million.\n\nThey also tweaked the plan and slashed the number of housing units it would build from 2,800 to 1,800. The athletes village planned for Victoria Park is off the books.\n\nThe housing component of the budget was cut to $490 million.\n\nIn order to make the whole thing work without asking the city to pay too much for its contribution, the BidCo said Calgary would be required to pony up $20 million in order to purchase a $200 million insurance contingency plan. The catch? No one knows if that kind of policy is available at this point.\n\nIf not, the BidCo says it will find further cuts.\n\nA detailed budget is not publicly available and Calgary 2026 itself has said it's still working on the details of its revised plan.\n\nPublic spending\n\nThe latest breakdown of costs for each level of government is:\n\nCity \u2014 $390 million.\n\nCanmore \u2014 $3 million.\n\nProvince \u2014 $700 million.\n\nFederal government \u2014 $1.423 billion, plus $30 million in \"leveraging initiatives.\"\n\nAlso included in the public funding totals is some creative math. There's the aforementioned insurance policy that may or may not exist, which contributes an additional $180 million to the BidCo's totals.\n\nThere's also $150 million in improvements to the Victoria Park area the city was already undertaking, which is counted as a city contribution on top of the $390 million.\n\nThe BidCo has said it has budgeted $1 billion in contingencies in case of cost overruns, which could be important given that no level of government is willing to pay more for any unexpected budget bulges \u2014 a regular event at Olympic Games.\n\nPrivate spending\n\nThe rest of the money to host the Games comes from the International Olympic Committee, which has pledged $1.2 billion in cash and services to the winning host city, and projected revenues of $2.23 billion.\n\nWhy so cheap?\n\nThese are being billed as budget Games, mostly using refurbished old venues from the '88 Olympics to host events in 2026. It's part of a promised new direction for the International Olympic Committee called Agenda 2020 that seeks to reduce costs and impacts on hosts \u2014 both on chequebooks and the environment.\n\nCalgary would be a test case and it's confident it can deliver a cheaper version of the mega sporting event.\n\nSo what do we get?\n\nUnlike the Olympics of recent memory, there would not be billions spent on a slew of sleek new sports facilities. The BidCo plans to spend $403 million on new venues and $502 million on fixing up old ones.\n\nCalgary's proposal includes refurbishing McMahon Stadium, the speed skating oval and the Saddledome \u2014 or using a new arena should a deal come together between the city and the Flames organization. It also includes heading back to Nakiska for ski events and Canada Olympic Park for sledding and more, as well as fixing up the Canmore Nordic Centre, the BMO Centre and Big 4 Building.\n\nThe proposal does include a new fieldhouse for Calgary, which would be used for figure skating and short-track speed skating, and a new mid-size arena.\n\nSki jumping is planned to take place in Whistler, B.C., rather than trying to fix the jumps at COP.\n\nCurling location? TBD, but Calgary 2026 says it would be somewhere in southern Alberta.\n\nAlso not in the budget is any infrastructure not directly related to the bid. Vancouver got a new train line and expanded highway for its Games, but there's no such push here. There's also no breakdown for costs of infrastructure that might be required for the Games but not directly tied to them \u2014 including any potential upgrades to existing city infrastructure.\n\nThe rewards\n\nThere's plenty of debate about just what hosting the Games would mean for Calgary. The bid corporation says Calgarians can expect a 10-to-1 return on their investment, equivalent to $4.4 billion in returns.\n\nThat claim has been called flawed.\n\nWhat is certain is the city will get billions in government money than it would otherwise not get and will reap some direct benefits from temporary employment, tourism dollars and some new and upgraded sports infrastructure. If the legacy venues from 1988 are any indication, those venues would be well-used for winter sports training and competition.\n\nThe risks\n\nAs mentioned, no one is willing to step up and promise to cover any cost overruns. Calgary 2026 says it has budgeted $1 billion for contingencies, but with questions regarding an overly optimistic security budget and an already lean bid proposal, there are concerns of costs exceeding that fund.\n\nOn security alone, the bid corporation has budgeted almost $500 million less than what it cost during the Vancouver Games in 2010.\n\nEvery single Olympics since 1968 has come in over budget, often costing more than twice as much as expected, according to a study out of Oxford University.\n\nAnd while Calgary 2026 says every Olympics since 2010 has ended with a surplus, that study was narrowly focused and didn't look at the role of public dollars in subsidizing that surplus, over and above the initial public payout.\n\nThe vote\n\nThe plebiscite \u2014 officially called the Vote of the Electors \u2014 takes place on Nov. 13, but advance voting is on Nov. 6 and 7.\n\nVoting takes place in all city wards.

Completed mail-in ballots have to be received no later than 4 p.m. on Nov. 13.\n\nBallots will be available in hospitals on voting day and there will be polls at Mount Royal University on Nov. 6 and the University of Calgary on Nov. 7, as well as advance polls at various seniors facilities.\n\nVoters are required to provide some identification, which can be an identification card, bank or credit card statement, tax assessment notice, insurance policy or coverage card or statement of government benefits. Passports are not valid as your ID.\n\nYou must be 18, a Canadian citizen, a resident of Calgary and be a resident of Alberta for the six consecutive months prior to the vote.\n\nYou do not have to register ahead of time.\n\nMore information can be found on the Calgary Elections website.\n\nLIVE EVENT: CBC Calgary Olympic Games Plebiscite Town Hall If you live in Calgary, find out what you need to know before you cast your vote in the Nov. 13 plebiscite by tuning in to the CBC Calgary Olympic Games Plebiscite Town Hall.

However, some pharmacies may have had inventory after that time [depending] how much they had in stock, but right now when they place their order, they are unable to get any more,\" said Lisa Woodill of the Pharmaceutical Association of Nova Scotia.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline attributes \"a disruption in the manufacturing process\" for the shortage.\n\n\"That could mean anything, from not able to source one of the ingredients that's required, to something to do with the equipment \u2014 we don't know any further details,\" Woodill said.\n\nManufacturer GlaxoSmithKline attributes \"a disruption in the manufacturing process\" for the shortage of Twinrix.\n\nIn an email to CBC News, the company did not pinpoint the cause of the disruption, only saying \"Twinrix is in short supply due to a suspension from the vaccine manufacturing site.\n\n\"In the meantime, GSK is committed to addressing requests for medical needs.\u200b GSK is working diligently to minimize any supply impact to patients and to return to normal supply volumes as soon as possible.\"\n\nHepatitis A is an extremely contagious liver disease spread through direct contact with an infected person or by eating contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B is a liver infection commonly spread through contact with blood, open sores or body fluids of someone who has the virus.\n\nThere's been no word from GlaxoSmithKline on when Twinrix will be available again.\n\nIt has posted some information about the shortage to a website called Drug Shortages Canada. Health Canada requires pharmaceutical companies to use the website for public notifications of anticipated and actual drug shortages, as well as discontinuations.\n\nFew options\n\n\"It is a real challenge. There is no other vaccine,\" said Woodill, a pharmacist who also serves a Halifax-area travel clinic.\n\nThe only other options would be to change your trip to another area where the risk of contracting hepatitis A or B isn't as much of a consideration, or take strict food and water precautions if you decide to travel without the vaccination, she said.\n\nShe said there has been a general shortage of vaccines for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B this fall, outside of the Twinrix supply disruption.\n\nRead more articles at CBC Nova Scotia", "The 2018 U.S. midterm elections prompted a surge of candidates from minority groups that have not had electoral success in the past.

But it was ultimately super fun.\n\nOn still not being over the P.K. Subban trade\n\nIt's a bloody nose that will never heal. I still don't think it was worth doing. I think that the vast majority of Habs fans agree with me. I think the vast majority of the hockey world agrees with me. That this was not the greatest decision.

They also lost veteran superstars Henrik and Daniel Sedin, who retired at the end of the year following 17 seasons in Vancouver.\n\nThe team signed free agents Jay Beagle, Tim Schaller and Antoine Roussel in the off-season, but questions lingered about where the Canucks scoring would come from.\n\nSo far, the squad's top five scorers are all 25 or younger. Rookie Elias Pettersson leads the pack with nine goals and six assists over nine games.\n\nThe 19-year-old Swedish centre was named the NHL's second star for last week based in part on his eye-popping five-point performance in Vancouver's 7-6 overtime win over the Colorado Avalanche on Friday.

After overseeing the abuse of 100's of children by Larry, national coaches and club coaches, it is high time for this organization to end and a new one, truly dedicated to athlete safety, to begin. A COMPLETE regimen change should start now. This is for every survivor. <a href=\"https://t.co/EpEbYPfth8\">https://t.co/EpEbYPfth8</a> \u2014@R_Denhollander\n\n\"Today's announcement by USOC seeks only to deflect from their total failure over decades to protect the gymnasts in their care,\" said a statement from attorneys Michelle Simpson Tuegel and Mo Aziz, who represent Olympian Tasha Schwikert and her sister, Jordan, in their lawsuit against USAG and the USOC.\n\nEven with a new board of directors that started in June, USA Gymnastics made repeated mistakes while dealing with the aftermath of revelations that the now-imprisoned Nassar molested Olympians while working as a volunteer. Those included the botched hiring of a program coordinator and an interim CEO to replace Kerry Perry, who lasted barely nine months on the job after the USOC forced out Steve Penny.\n\nThe announcement comes only days after the U.S. team brought home nine medals from the World Championships in the first major meet in the lead-up to Tokyo in 2020. Five of those were individual medals won by Olympic champion Simone Biles, who is among the athletes who have not hesitated to criticize the organization.\n\nSimone Biles wins record fourth all-around world title:\n\nThe American gymnast overcame a kidney stone to post an an all-around score of 57.491 and win her fourth all-around title at the 2018 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Doha. 4:32\n\nBy decertifying USA Gymnastics, the USOC is taking major action against an organization that never grasped control over its own rebuilding. But the move also leaves a void that cannot be easily filled. In addition to supporting elite and Olympic athletes, and selecting teams and coaches for international competitions, USA Gymnastics serves more than 150,000 athletes in 3,000 clubs around the country. There is no other organization standing by to fill that need.\n\n\"Seeking to revoke recognition is not a decision that we have come to easily, but I believe it is the right action,\" Hirshland said. \"In the short-term, we will work to ensure that America's gymnasts have the support necessary to excel on and off the field of play. We are building plans to do just that no matter the outcome of the revocation process.\"\n\nThe federal law that governs the USOC gives the federation final say on which organizations represent each sport at the Olympics, and also establishes a process to decertify the organizations. But that process is used only under the most extreme circumstances. One example came in 1994 when the USOC recommended decertifying the NRA as the governing body for shooting, and the NRA accepted the decision. The USOC also has dictated changes and placed its own administrators in charge of smaller NGBs in need of overhauls.\n\nHirshland said she has given USA Gymnastics the option of surrendering its recognition voluntarily, though there was no indication of which direction USAG would go. It issued a statement saying it was looking at the USOC letter \"and is evaluating the best path forward for our athletes, professional members, the organization and staff.\"\n\nThe statement detailed the challenges the new board has faced since taking over in June.\n\nIt is in search of its fourth president and CEO in the last 19 months thanks to a series of resignations, all of them under pressure from the USOC or the gymnastics' community at large.\n\nPenny \u2014 named as a co-defendant in several civil lawsuits filed by former elite gymnasts\u2014 stepped down in March 2017. He was arrested last month and charged with destroying or hiding documents related to Nassar's activities at the Karolyi Ranch, the ex-national training center near Huntsville, Texas, where a number of gymnasts said Nassar abused them.\n\nThe organization named Perry as Penny's replacement but her tenure lasted barely nine months. She was criticized by several high-profile gymnasts, Biles included, for failing to offer a clear vision on the way forward and quit in September.\n\nHer resignation came shortly after the hiring, then quick removal, of Mary Lee Tracy as elite development coordinator; Tracy had been supportive of Nassar when the allegations first surfaced.\n\nUSA Gymnastics brought on former U.S. Representative Mary Bono to serve as interim president and CEO last month.

Nowicki's health was so poor she could no longer walk or speak.\n\nThe publicly funded Catholic health provider refuses to facilitate assisted deaths, saying doing so would violate the faith that underpins its medical care. Its default position is that patients cannot even sign the form requesting an assisted death, or receive MAID assessments by Alberta Health Services (AHS) staff, on its property.\n\nWhen the federal government legalized assisted dying in 2016, the Alberta government, under Health Minister Sarah Hoffman, exempted Covenant Health from having to provide those services.\n\n\"Now we are seeing some of the areas that need to be addressed going forward in terms of ensuring that people have equal access to a perfectly legal medical service,\" Friends of Medicare executive director Sandra Azocar said.\n\n\"That is what the legislation needs to address, is whether or not institutions themselves have a right to basically trump patients' rights,\" she said.\n\nPatient access to services \"impeded\"\n\nLast week, CBC News revealed that in 2016 another patient, 72-year-old Bob Hergott, had to sign his form requesting an assisted death in a bus shelter.\n\nCovenant Health, which operates the hospital where he had been a patient for five years, would not allow him to complete the document on its property.

Ethics and legal experts have said Covenant's policy is inhumane and infringes on patients' rights.\n\nFollowing the publishing of CBC News reports, Covenant Health said it is reviewing the language in its policy. The organization said since April 2018, all of its patients requesting MAID were allowed to sign their forms, and have their assessments, on site.\n\nAlberta Health Minister Sarah Hoffman said she will be monitoring the review and will enact her own policy if she is not happy with Covenant Health's new policy. She did not commit to a further review by her ministry on patients' access to assisted dying services in religious facilities, including the procedures themselves.\n\nBut Azocar said Hoffman must take a clear stance on this issue, arguing Covenant Health cannot be trusted to properly address the problems with its policy.\n\nAssisted dying decision 'very difficult'\n\n\"Institutions are deciding whether or not people can even use their facilities for services,\" she said.\n\nThe decision to access MAID services \"is a very difficult, private time for people,\" Azocar said.\n\n\"And putting that onus on them to go somewhere else to even get an assessment, I think is a little bit inhumane and it needs to be addressed.\"\n\nShe said individual clinicians, like nurse practitioners and doctors, cannot be legally forced to provide MAID services, \"but that shouldn't be the case around the institutions,\" which are publicly funded.\n\nAzocar said a solution could be that Covenant Health allow non-objecting clinicians to provide those services on its property, so patients do not need to be transferred.\n\n\"Faith based institutions should not be able to interpret the law to the point where those Albertans who are seeking a perfectly legal public medical service are impeded from having equitable access,\" she said in a news release.\n\n\n\nIf you have information about this story, please contact us in confidence at cbcinvestigates@cbc.ca.\n\n\n\n@jennierussell_", "Video\n\nCBC Nova Scotia News November 05, 2018\n\nThe only daily TV news package to focus on Nova Scotians and their stories", "New evidence at the Muskrat Falls inquiry shows mid-level bureaucrats in the Finance Department were pushing for a broad review of the controversial project before it was sanctioned in 2012 \u2014 but their concerns did not reach the top public servant in the department.\n\nThere's also evidence that an independent review of Muskrat that was recommended by the departments of Finance and Natural Resources was never carried out.\n\nThese were some of the revelations from the inquiry Monday as Terry Paddon, deputy minister of finance from 2004 to mid-2012, took the witness stand.\n\n'Potential burden to taxpayers'\n\nA January 2012 \"information note\" prepared by three officials raised serious concerns about Muskrat Falls, stating government was \"abdicating its responsibility\" to the people by limiting the scope of a review by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).\n\nThe trio also recommended that sanction of Muskrat Falls be delayed one or two years to \"allow a full assessment of alternatives and a complete analysis of the potential burden to taxpayers if development of Muskrat Falls has substantial cost overruns.\"\n\nPaddon said he never became aware of the note until he was interviewed by inquiry co-counsel Barry Learmonth this past summer.\n\nThe document was prepared by \"W.

Anderson noted the current legislation allows someone to donate $5,000 to every candidate in the province. Under the changes in Bill 23, they can only make $4,000 in total donations.\n\nThe government said it wants to set a limit for how much campaigns can spend, but will conduct additional consultation before deciding on a figure.\n\nPACs covered under bill\n\nIf the bill is passed, all candidates, including those who fund their own campaigns, will have to disclose their donors. The names of anyone who donates more than $50 will be made public.\n\nThe legislation also empowers Alberta's new elections commissioner to investigate and prosecute those who break the rules, and to administer penalties including fines of up to $10,000.\n\nSuch matters have to be referred to the Court of Queen's Bench under the current system.\n\n\"A lot of people either didn't have the resources or the time to do that, so going to the elections commissioner is a real good step for us,\" Anderson said.\n\nAs under provincial legislation, there will be no limits on who can donate to PACs or how much donors can contribute.\n\nBut PACs will have to register with the jurisdiction where they want to advertise once total donations hit the $1,000 mark. The jurisdiction is required to publicly post that information.\n\nOther reforms under the bill include prohibiting candidates from posting signs or greeting voters on the property outside a polling station, requiring communities larger than 5,000 residents to hold advanced polling and eliminating the six-month residency requirement for people to vote in local elections.\n\nThe province followed advice from the chief electoral officer and eliminated the six-month residency requirement for provincial elections last year.\n\nIf passed, the new law would come into effect on Jan. 1, 2019.

It stretches from the shores of Lake Ontario to the Pennsylvania border and includes the cities of Rome, Utica and Binghamton.\n\nMivasair says it's a very \"polarized\" area. He's never sure if the person answering the door when he knocks will be an ardent Trump supporter, or someone who is pledging to vote Democrat this week.

Brindisi polled at 46 per cent, while Tenney was at 45 percent.\n\nOnce, the political conversations Mivasair was having were about bringing \"civility\" back to politics.

The watershed supplies drinking water to Moncton, Dieppe and Riverview.\n\nMoncton, which owns the reservoirs, has said the algae have not affected water safety. But the city has incurred added costs as it looks at ways to manage the problem.\n\nMoncton sells the drinking water to Riverview and Dieppe at a wholesale rate.\n\nRobert Higson, the town's director of finance, said the wholesale rate of 53.2 cents per cubic metre is projected to increase to 61.4 cents per cubic metre.\n\n\"This increase this year is significantly more than in prior years,\" he said.\n\nStaff looking to lessen impact\n\nThe increase could be felt on water bills.\n\nIf the full increase is passed on to consumers, residential water bills could go up by $30 to $40 annually, Higson said.\n\nStaff are looking at ways to reduce that impact, such as adjusting plans to replace old cast iron pipes, he said.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to keep that as low as we possibly can,\" Higson said.\n\nTower Road reservoir is Greater Moncton's secondary water source.

Overall, 30 per cent of the participants used cannabis.\n\nCompared to non-users, cannabis users had about twice the risk of experiencing a serious complication known as diabetic ketoacidosis, which develops when blood sugar is elevated for too long and the body produces high levels of acids known as ketones. Left untreated, ketoacidosis can lead to severe dehydration, swelling in the brain, coma and death.\n\nSome previous research has suggested that for people with Type 2 diabetes \u2014 the more common form of the disease linked to obesity \u2014 cannabis may make it easier to use the hormone insulin to convert foods into energy and maintain lower blood sugar levels, researchers noted in JAMA Internal Medicine. But less is known about the impact of cannabis on people with Type 1 diabetes, the less common form that typically develops in childhood.\n\nIt's possible that vomiting caused by long-term cannabis use might lead to dehydration that can increase ketones and lead to ketoacidosis in people with Type 1 diabetes, said senior study author Dr. Viral Shah of the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.\n\n\"Elevated ketones may be life-threatening if not treated on time, and patients can [have] nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath and rarely confusion or altered consciousness,\" Shah told Reuters by email. \"Diabetic ketoacidosis is an emergency and patient with diabetes should go to [the] emergency room if they have symptoms.\"\n\nThe condition is typically treated with intravenous fluids to hydrate the body and replenish electrolytes and insulin to control blood sugar.\n\nThe study participants typically had poorly controlled diabetes, based on blood tests of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which reflect average blood sugar levels over about three months. People with Type 1 diabetes are generally advised to keep their HbA1c levels below 6.5 percent.\n\nParticipants who used cannabis in the study had average A1c readings of 8.4 per cent, representing dangerously elevated blood sugar that can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, blindness, amputations and death.\n\nNon-cannabis users had average A1c readings of 7.6 per cent, still higher than ideal but not as dangerous as the levels for people who used marijuana.\n\nMore research needed\n\nThe study's limitations include the fact that it wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how cannabis might directly cause ketoacidosis. The authors also acknowledged that the findings relied on self-reported diabetes outcomes and that \"the possibility of unmeasured confounders, such as access to health care, cannot be excluded.\"\n\nMore research is needed to understand the different impact of cannabis on people with different types of diabetes, said Dr. Annemarie Hennessy, dean of the School of Medicine at Western Sydney University in Australia.\n\n\"In Type 1, individuals don't make insulin and in Type 2, it mostly doesn't work well,\" Hennessy, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.\n\nPatients should err on the side of caution and avoid cannabis, Hennessy advised.\n\n\"Why cannabis would increase the likelihood of diabetic ketoacidosis is unknown,\" Hennessy said.\n\n\"But we have also shown that in the presence of cannabis, the diabetic ketoacidosis is harder to diagnose, and therefore it may be missed, with deadly consequences.\"", "Blaine Higgs and his Progressive Conservative cabinet will be sworn into office Friday.\n\nHiggs confirmed the day on Monday and said the fast transition to power, just one week after Premier Brian Gallant's Liberal government lost a confidence vote, will allow him to get down to work promptly.\n\n\"Our target is still on track for what we said in terms of a quick plan, a quick move to government,\" the premier-designate told reporters during a break in briefings from the civil service. \"I'm excited about that.\"\n\nThe PC leader spent part of the weekend and most of Monday getting presentations from public servants, including on the state of the province's finances.\n\nHIGGS: PC government to be sworn in this Friday, Nov. 9. <a href=\"https://t.co/HHvj466XLR\">pic.twitter.com/HHvj466XLR</a> \u2014@poitrasCBC\n\nThat followed his visit to Government House on Friday, where Lt.-Gov.

It's called \"The Great One's Back,\" and Marceau enacted it an exhausting 12 times during Nuit Blanche Edmonton this fall.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nArtist Thierry Marceau embodies Wayne Gretzky and examines what he's meant to Edmonton. Filmmaker: aAron Munson. 6:11\n\nFar from impersonation \u2014 where you might expect to see a lookalike dressed as a celebrity and offering autographs or selfies \u2014 Marceau's performances are intricate webs, distilled from the important (and sometimes imagined) events in his subjects' lives. For example, his \"The Great One's Back\" stages vital landmarks from the hockey icon's timeline like Gretzky's wedding, the bachelor party we never got to see, his heartbreaking transition to the L.A. Kings and the injury that almost ended his career. All are woven into a performance that puts physical and emotional demands on Marceau, who through this production ponders Gretzky's legacy and the imprint he has left on Edmonton.\n\nIn this video by filmmaker aAron Munson, Marceau takes you through some of the elements driving his performance, and you get to be a fly on the wall as he goes through Gretzky's life.

Now, Phase 2 is expected to be opened by the second half of November with Phase 3 still in the planning stages, according to Transportation Minister Steve Crocker.\n\n\"It's a substantial construction project. You'll see by the numerous overhead structures, and when you look at building overpasses ... it takes, in most cases, two to three years to complete these major concrete structures,\" Crocker told CBC News.\n\nThe cost of the highway from the Outer Ring Road to Kenmount Road was $11.6 million, split evenly between the provincial and federal governments at 50 per cent each.\n\nThe cost of the highway from Kenmount to Topsail Road is $58.9 million, with the federal government contributing $22.5 million and the provincial government covering the rest.\n\nThe Department of Transportation pegs the total cost of the construction of the Team Gushue Highway from the Outer Ring Road to Topsail Road at $70.5 million.\n\nDisplacing traffic\n\nThere's still a lot of finishing work to be completed before an exact opening date can be provided, said Crocker, but the section of highway is very close to being completed.\n\nSt. John's Coun.

Of the 18, only seven chose to report their assault to police.\n\n\"We learned that women had great concerns about being automatically disbelieved,\" said Alana Prochuk, co-author of the report and manager of public legal education at West Coast LEAF.\n\n\"We heard lots of concerns about being blamed.\"\n\nThe report highlighted socio-cultural attitudes toward sexual assault like victim blaming; fears of repercussions or of not having enough evidence for a case; and the conduct of individuals working in the justice system as a few of the factors determining whether a victim reports sexual assault or not.\n\nThe interviews were conducted by YWCA Metro Vancouver staff over the phone and at several support organizations in the Vancouver area.\n\nDiscrimination and marginalization\n\nSexual assaults are \"devastatingly common\" in Canada, Prochuk said, citing Statistics Canada research that shows one in 25 women in Canada experienced sexual assault in the last year.\n\n\"This issue doesn't impact all women in the same way. The rates of violence are very different based on different factors of marginalization,\" she said.\n\n\"When we think about how people's credibility is assessed, a lot of discrimination can come into play.\"\n\nOnly about five per cent of sexual assaults are reported to police, Prochuk said.\n\n\"Navigating the criminal justice system is not the path to healing and justice for all women \u2014 that's not the point of the report at all,\" she told Stephen Quinn, the host of CBC's The Early Edition.\n\n\"But for some survivors, it is a meaningful part of their path and they find that huge barriers stand in their way \u2014 it's about identifying those barriers and chipping away at them.\"\n\nSexual assault survivor Jodie Ortega says it took her years to be able to report the crimes committed against her to police. (CBC)\n\n'Mentally draining process'\n\nJodie Ortega, a survivor of multiple sexual assaults who was interviewed for the report, waited years before going to police with her story.\n\n\"The only thing I was thinking of after I had been assaulted was survival \u2014 I was a teenager, I wasn't thinking of taking a bus to Burnaby RCMP,\" said Ortega, who is now an advocate for assault survivors.\n\n\"There's a myth that after a person is sexually assaulted, the first step that they do is they go report to the police. That was not my case in all three separate cases.\"\n\nShe eventually reported the crimes after years of reflection and consistent therapy, through a third party.\n\n\"It was a really exhausting and mentally draining process,\" Ortega said.\n\n\"Before you go into it, you have this mindset that, 'this is going to be empowering' \u2026 it's not the case and it definitely is re-traumatizing, especially if you don't have the specific supports available.\"\n\nEven in the #MeToo era, victims of sexual assault often face barriers reporting the crime to police and a new report, based on interviews with survivors, shines light on why reporting sexual assault remains a challenge. 12:21\n\nWith files from The Early Edition", "Representatives for the town of Pictou, N.S., did not learn the proposed route for a new effluent pipe from Northern Pulp would cross their watershed until the plan was made public in media reports.\n\nOfficials from the pulp mill met with Pictou Landing First Nation officials and fishermen's associations several weeks ago to detail the new proposed route after problems were discovered with the original route.\n\nThe mill needs a new effluent treatment site because Nova Scotia legislation calls for the closure of the 140-hectare treatment lagoon at Boat Harbour by January 2020.\n\nBoth proposed plans from the mill \u2014 the original and the subsequent \"Plan B\" \u2014 have drawn criticism and opposition because they would ultimately see treated waste water pumped into the Northumblerand Strait, something that's raised fears about the future of local fishing areas and stocks.\n\nPictou Mayor Jim Ryan said the town's problems with the plan only grew when officials learned Plan B, which would include an overland stretch of pipeline along the causeway across Pictou Harbour, would also cross the town's watershed and the Caribou wellfield, a source of domestic drinking water for the town and some people in the immediate area.\n\n\"I would have thought if the mill or the planners were aware that [the proposed route] passed through the town of Pictou watershed that we would have been seen as an interested party \u2014 let's put it that way \u2014 prior to it going to the media,\" Ryan said in a phone interview.\n\nAt Monday evening's council meeting, letters will be tabled that were exchanged between Ryan, on behalf of council, and Bruce Chapman, the mill's general manager.\n\nRyan said they include the town expressing concern about not being informed of Plan B ahead of time, Chapman apologizing and stressing the early nature of the plan, and Ryan stating that the plan is unacceptable to the town.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a leak was discovered in an underground effluent pipe at Boat Harbour, just a day before mill officials were to meet with Pictou Landing First Nation and fishermen's associations.\n\nA broken underground pipe that leaked paper mill effluent into a wooded area near Pictou Landing First Nation in Nova Scotia several weeks ago has been repaired. (Kathy Cloutier/Paper Excellence Canada)\n\nRyan said it seems the mill is finding itself in a \"more and more difficult situation\" as the closure date for Boat Harbour looms.\n\n\"It actually feels to me like they were just floating a balloon here,\" he said of the Plan B proposal.\n\n\"I don't know if any level of thought, or certainly not planning or assessment of the proposed pipe, would have been done. I think it's almost \u2014 'What about this?'\"\n\nMill officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe mayor said the town took a \"strong stance\" with respect to the fishery, asking for federal oversight of the plan and \"no harm to the fishery\" even before Plan B was made public. Concerns about protecting source water create another issue, he said.\n\n\"It will present significant opposition and I'm guessing that's going to be another obstacle for Northern Pulp to overcome.\"\n\nPremier Stephen McNeil has said the company that owns the mill, Paper Excellence, has had plenty of notice to prepare for the Boat Harbour closure date and he has no intention of revisiting the legislation unless officials with Pictou Landing First Nation tell him otherwise. People in that community, including Chief Andrea Paul, have expressed no support for any of the mill's plans to date.\n\nMeanwhile, fishermen in the Pictou area started a blockade on Monday, pledging to prevent an independent survey boat and crew contracted by the mill from gathering data to be used as part of its proposal. The mill has yet to submit its application to the province for an environmental assessment.\n\nThe matter has created tense times in the community, with strong views on either side of the issue when it comes to the mill's plan for effluent treatment and its future in the community.\n\nRyan said council knows there would be a financial consequence of losing the mill \u2014 \"at least initially\" \u2014 and he's aware of the potential implications for the forestry industry. Within the town, however, there is \"some fatigue\" for the mill, he said.\n\nTrying to be optimistic\n\n\"We have the air quality issues from time to time here and now, when they talk about an important industry \u2014 that being the fishery \u2014 that adds to that concern. So there's a certain amount of fatigue in the town.\"\n\nDespite the concerns and the tensions, Ryan said he tries to remain optimistic a solution can be found that satisfies everyone.\n\n\"There are a lot of lives that will be affected by whatever happens in this particular situation, so I'm hopeful that there's a solution where we can protect both jobs and the environment.\"\n\nRead more articles from CBC Nova Scotia", "An explosion Monday afternoon at the Burnside Industrial Park in Dartmouth, N.S., shook nearby buildings and left parked vehicles caked in brown dust.\n\nFirefighters, police and ambulances were seen responding to the site of Quality Concrete on MacDonald Avenue after a loud blast was heard around 3:20 p.m.\n\nHalifax Fire said the roof blew off a silo, sending concrete dust and other debris into the air.\n\n\"Windows were shuddering all over the neighbourhood and there was a huge plume of smoke emanating from the building,\" said division fire Chief Stephen Nearing.\n\nThe cause of the explosion still wasn't known as of early Monday evening.\n\nNearing said the air quality would be tested.

Why does RA afflict more Indigenous people than everyone else?\n\nA: We don't really understand all the factors that accumulate in one individual to trigger rheumatoid arthritis. But we do know there are factors that can predispose people. Genetics is one component. Exposure to cigarette smoking is another.\n\nWe worry about other environmental exposures as well, which may include things such as stress and trauma \u2014 and all of these things meld together to create one's own individual risk for developing this condition.\n\nQ: What does it feel like to have rheumatoid arthritis?\n\nA: It's an autoimmune disease, so it can start with just one joint, and then another, becoming inflamed. But by the time it is recognized as rheumatoid arthritis, people will have several swollen joints.\n\nIn our body, we count up to 66 joints in a rheumatology exam, and some people will come in with as many as 38 swollen joints. These are small joints in the hands, in the wrists, so it can be difficult to do things such as hold your toothbrush in the morning, doing up the buttons on their shirt.\n\nIt's really quite difficult to move because of stiffness. So people will wake up hours before they have to actually go to work normally, because they need some time to loosen up before they go.\n\nQ: Is it reversible?\n\nA: We don't have any cure for rheumatoid arthritis at this time. Instead, we use medications to help control the inflammation and prevent the joint damage that can occur.\n\nQ: You're a physician for a number of health clinics on reserves. Can you give some examples of how debilitating this is for the people involved?\n\nA: We see a large proportion of young women coming in to present with rheumatoid arthritis for the first time. These women are trying to go to school, gain their education, start their careers, start their families, and they're delayed in being able to do that, because of their arthritis condition being active.\n\nWe also see [cases where] people come in 13 years after their condition started, and when we ask why that might be, it relates to how the health system has not been able to get them through the door to the specialist.\n\nQ: How do we turn it around?\n\nA: We've asked patients about that experience, and what barriers have come up along their journey, and what are the things that make it easier to get in for care.\n\nWe know that the family is an important piece of this.\n\nAnd so we need quite a lot of family support, and the ability to recognize that this is a condition that can be treated, can be dealt with \u2014 so that recognition by providers, by family members and by patients, is important as a first step.\n\nWe also know that there are several issues that occur when people contact the health system. And so we really need to make that ability to come into a safe, culturally relevant environment much much more available to patients.\n\nQ: Is part of the problem that Indigenous people just think of it as part of life?\n\nA: We've heard that in some of our research interviews. Because so many people in the community have arthritis, it's not seen as anything that needs attention, because it's so common.\n\nIt is thought of as what happens to people.\n\nWe do have an awareness piece to work on \u2014 but we also need to change how we deliver that care.\n\nAs a specialist, there are a lot of steps to getting to us that have been created. Some of those things have been put in place because of the history of medicine. Some has been put in place by being efficient, and trying to maximize our health-care dollars.\n\nBut it really doesn't help the patient who needs to get in, if they need to follow steps of getting a family doctor, having a doctor recognize that they have inflammatory arthritis, then getting all the lab tests and X-rays done. So we really need to remove some of those steps and make it simpler to get in for a diagnosis.\n\nWith files from the Calgary Eyeopener.", "This week and next, free workshops are being held at McGill University to show people how to use naloxone, the opioid overdose antidote which is available for free at Quebec pharmacies without a prescription.\n\nRichard Davy, a first-year McGill social work student, is running the workshops this week and next.\n\nAccording to the Public Health Agency of Canada, there were 181 opioid-related deaths in Quebec last year, and that's a number Davy would like to see reduced.\n\nHe told CBC Montreal's Daybreak Monday he got the idea after doing outreach work in the city and seeing first-hand how serious the problem is in Montreal.\n\n\"We noticed that there was definitely an issue with people overusing opioids,\" he said.\n\nAfter learning more about naloxone and how to administer the life-saving drug, he decided everybody should have such training.\n\nAt the workshops, Davy will discuss the opioid crisis in Montreal and across Canada and teach people how to use the kits properly.\n\nFor someone without medical training, the kit can be intimidating, he said, as it involves an intramuscular injection of the antidote.\n\n\"But the training is relatively simple,\" he said. \"I think a lot of it is understanding what it does and the impact it can have on someone's life.\"\n\nDavy said in each kit, there are two retractable syringes, two vials of naloxone, gloves, alcohol pads, instructions and mouth guards for delivering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

She said most contract faculty do not have desks to call their own, health benefits or pensions, or job security. Living contract to contract is extremely stressful, she added.\n\n\"We should be making progress in addressing fairness for contract faculty, not rolling back reasonable and essential elements to improve workers' rights,\" she said.\n\n\"If the premier is really here for the people, the hard-working, front-line people, and is truly committed to helping people like me make ends meet, then he should withdraw Bill 47.\"\n\nBill to weaken learning conditions, grad student says\n\nHamish Russell, an international graduate student at the University of Toronto and a member of Canadian Union of Public Employees, told the news conference that post-secondary students and workers juggle many jobs, high rents and demanding course loads.\n\nThe bill will not only erode working conditions, it will also weaken learning conditions, he said.", "Two men at a federal prison in Manitoba have been charged with first-degree murder in the death of a fellow inmate.\n\nNolan Randal Thomas, 26, was found unresponsive in his cell at Stony Mountain Institution just before 8:30 p.m. on Nov. 2.

Watch it here.\n\nU.S. sanctions on Iran\n\nThe Americans aren't being coy about the goal of renewed sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n\"The Iranian regime has a choice: It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters this morning in Washington.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin present details of the new sanctions on Iran at the Foreign Press Center in Washington on Monday. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)\n\nToday's measures, which are aimed at Iranian banks, shipping firms and the country's national airline, follow bans on currency exchange and the trading of gold and other metals last August. And the Trump administration has said that it ultimately intends to reduce Iran's oil exports to \"zero\" as it seeks to force Tehran to further curb its missile and nuclear programs.\n\nOrdinary Iranians are already feeling the pain:\n\nBut will all that economic misery actually bring any change?\n\nSo far, all the signs point to no.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani attends a meeting with finance ministry officials in Tehran on Monday. Iran greeted the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions with air defence drills and an acknowledgement from Rouhani that the nation faces a 'war situation.' (Iranian Presidency Office via AP)\n\nAlong with announcing the banking and shipping sanctions this morning, Washington granted exemptions to eight of the world's biggest consumers of Iranian oil. It is allowing China, South Korea, Japan, India, Greece, Italy, Turkey and Taiwan to continue importing crude without fear of reprisal for at least 180 days.\n\nMike Pompeo said the move was designed to protect world supply and avoid market disruptions, pointing out that 20 countries have already stopped buying oil from Iran.\n\nYet oil continues to be the Islamic Republic's biggest source of foreign revenue, with exports of more than 1.8 million barrels a day.\n\nAnd it's not clear how much more Washington can tighten the screws.\n\nAn ongoing trade war with China diminishes Trump's leverage in Beijing. And Vladimir Putin has been a big proponent of the existing nuclear deal, dispatching a special envoy to Tehran this morning to underline Russia's \"unequivocal support\" for the ruling clerics in the face of American \"unilateralism.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the EU has been busy trying to insulate European businesses from threats of U.S. reprisals should they continue to trade with Iran. A \"blocking statute\" to nullify American legal actions was passed in early in August. And Brussels will soon create a financial workaround called a Special Purpose Vehicle that will allow payments between its corporations and Iran to entirely avoid the regular banking system.\n\nIn this photo provided Monday by the Iranian Army, a Sayyad 2 missile is fired by the Talash air defence system during drills in an undisclosed location in Iran. (Iranian Army via AP)\n\nSanction-busting smuggling is already on the rise in Iran. As much as 40 million litres a day of gasoline and heating fuel is shipped across Iran's borders and exchanged for cash, food and consumer goods.\n\nIn the end, the renewed U.S. measures are simply a return to what has been the norm in Iran since the 1979 revolution. And there isn't much evidence that Washington's big stick works.\n\nThe International Crisis Group, a D.C. think tank, compared 40 years of Iranian foreign policy with data on its economy. It found that the Islamic Republic is nothing if not resolute, \"continuing to pursue policies it deems central to its national security no matter its degree of economic well-being at home.\"\n\nIn other words, sanctions hurt, but they don't change much.\n\nExcept in one key way \u2014 by making Iran exceptionally efficient in terms of what it gets in return for what it gives its allies and proxies.\n\nA man holds Iranian rials at a currency exchange shop in Basra, Iraq, on Saturday, before the start of the U.S. sanctions on Tehran. (Essam al-Sudani/Reuters)\n\nAt the height of the last round of concerted international sanctions in 2012, Iran's economy shrank by 7.7 per cent as inflation galloped and the rial became virtually worthless.\n\n\"Yet this period coincided with what many consider the most significant expansion of Iran's military intervention in the region,\" the ICC notes, as Tehran took advantage of the chaos in Syria and Iraq and forged new alliances throughout the Middle East.\n\nFood for thought, perhaps, for the tough-talking Trump White House.\n\nLike this newsletter?

Check out Ohio's 12 District, a traditional Republican stronghold where the midterm vote tomorrow could go either way, writes Rosemary Barton.\n\nA couple of weeks back I headed off to Columbus, Ohio, and then took a short drive to a fairly middle-class suburb called Westerville.\n\nIt also happens to be Ohio's 12 District, historically a mostly Republican area. In the last election Donald Trump won it handily by 11 points.\n\nBut in a special election held back in August, the Republican candidate only managed to squeak by with less than a 1-percentage-point victory.\n\nSo this district of Ohio seemed like a good place to try and understand an America that is so clearly divided.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally on Oct. 31 in Estero, Fla., to help Republican candidates running in the upcoming midterm election. His speeches have tended to fire up supporters and inflame critics, but it's their effect on more moderate voters that could swing the midterms. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nWe got a room with a round table, set up our cameras, and based on the work of a very diligent producer and some researchers, assembled a group of local voters. Call it a curated focus group.\n\nOn one side of the table, three Trump supporters. On the other, three Trump critics. All of them strong in their beliefs, but all of them also willing to leave work or their personal commitments early to sit at a table and talk politics \u2014 with the help of a Canadian journalist to moderate.\n\nNone of them got paid or even had to be coaxed into doing it. They all seemed to want to talk about their views and their differences.\n\nOn immigration, the Trump critics said the President is stoking fears. One African-American woman told us his rhetoric has given people \"permission\" to be racist.\n\nThe Trump supporters told us the President had kept his promises, improved the economy, and made them feel proud of their country again.\n\nBut on one issue, the two sides agreed: The country is divided and it has to be repaired.\n\nOhio voters hash out divisive political and social issues during The National's panel. (Carmen Merrifield/CBC)\n\nThis is the America that is sometimes difficult to see at political rallies, or on TV screens where pundits are sniping at one another.\n\nBut this, too, is America \u2014 a group of decent people who are working hard to make their lives better and care so deeply about their country that they are willing to sit down and talk about it.\n\nOne of the pro-Trump voters said that in his day-to-day life he could easily avoid meeting anyone with different opinions than his, and would likely never have met those from across the table had it not been for The National bringing the two sides together.\n\nNone of them seemed to think things would be better after the midterm results on Tuesday, but all of them seemed to want improvements to happen. And even though we talked to them before the shooting at the synagogue and the attempted mail bombings of high-profile Americans, I'm certain that their desire to find some common ground would still be there now.\n\nThey are just regular people, hoping for something better, like so many Americans.

According to a 2016 census report the town is home to 150 people.\n\nEntire drums of fuel were sold individually to the people of Black Tickle in the past. Keefe said if you were short on the price of the barrel some people wouldn't get any fuel at all. She said gasoline costs over $300, while home heating oil was over $200, plus shipping fees if customers looked to Cartwright for their fuel supply.\n\nKeefe said generally people use one can of oil per day, nine of which fill a drum.\n\n\"We've been told that the clinic is not being supplied gas. We have to get it in on our own,\" Keefe said, adding Woodward's Oil filled the home heating oil for the clinic in October, but didn't supply the gasoline.\n\n\"So that affects the ambulance, the vehicle that we use to go to the airport to pick up mail. it affects our generator.\"\n\nWhile Woodward's has stopped servicing the community, according to Keefe, the company has still been supplying the clinic, school, airport and hydroelectric station.\n\nChallenges in Black Tickle\n\nLisa Dempster, MHA for Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair, said fuel supply is one of a long list of challenges to deal with in Black Tickle. According to Dempster, when government learned of Woodward's plan to exit the community in 2015 after 30 years of supplying gasoline and furnace oil, they immediately went to work on a plan to rectify the problem.\n\nDempster said the provincial government and service district worked closely with Woodward's in September to supply a fuel truck to the community, calculating roughly 100 barrels would be needed to serve the town.\n\nThe remote Labrador community of Black Tickle is accessible only by plane or ferry during the summer. (Facebook)\n\n\"That fuel got delivered on Thursday morning,\" Dempster said. \"I got a message on Thursday morning saying yes the truck was in and every household got a couple of drums, but it's not going to be enough.\"\n\nDempster said she then worked immediately to provide a second truckload of fuel. The MHA didn't say when the second truckload would arrive.\n\n\"So there's a couple of things. We can't say there's a shortage of gasoline in the community right now because we just had 100 drums delivered,\" she said.\n\n\"What we're talking about is getting additional gasoline into the community so that the supply lasts longer, into the winter. Home heating fuel, that gets delivered every fall to isolated communities. It had already been delivered to Black Tickle.\"\n\nWith files from Labrador Morning\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "Police say a man has been charged after he allegedly tried to attack someone with an axe in Oshawa, Ont.\n\nDurham regional police say the incident happened at a public park on the evening of Halloween.\n\nThey say the accused was involved in an altercation with another male, and allegedly tried to strike him with a brush axe \u2014 which looks more like machete than a traditional axe.\n\nPolice say the accused also allegedly damaged a parked vehicle.\n\nThey say he was disarmed by several bystanders, who held him until officers arrived.\n\nInvestigators say the 33-year-old has been charged with possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose, assault with a weapon, mischief under $5,000 and failing to comply with a probation order.", "bad url", "A forestry company in northern New Brunswick charged after the death of a 17-year-old employee has pleaded guilty to violating workplace safety legislation.\n\nWanny Pelletier died in the Edmundston hospital in December 2016, four days after a work accident where he became stuck under a conveyor at a Saint-Quentin plant.\n\nThe Savoie Group \u2014 the town's largest employer, was in Campbellton provincial court Monday to respond to charges laid under the Occupational Health and Safety Act.\n\nTwo charges were laid last December after an investigation into Pelletier's death by WorkSafeNB and the RCMP.\n\nThe company pleaded guilty to failing to provide the necessary supervision of Pelletier.

That's where the funny story is. So in this book, I talk about things like the time we crashed in a helicopter while searching for a bat cave. It ended quite badly, and those are the stories that are fun to tell.\n\n\"I also write a lot about the fact that it was the same group of people on the road for 15 years which is pretty unique. I think it's the hardest thing in the world to keep the band together. And yet we managed to do it. It's easy to hang out with someone when everything is going great.

Tatham played on Canada's national team for 10 years and is on the coaching staff for both the Raptors 905 and University of Toronto women's team. From her unique perspective, she weighs in on the state of women's basketball in Canada. 3:51\n\nTatham has a point.\n\nSold out crowds at the 2015 Pan Am Games and a 2017 NCAA matchup featuring Hamilton, Ont.'s, Kia Nurse, both held at the Mattamy Centre in Toronto, prove people will show up to games. And multiple Canadian players who have thrived on the national team have made it onto WNBA: Nurse, Natalie Achonwa and Kayla Alexander, to name a few.\n\nThe WNBA is one of few options Canadian women have in terms of making basketball a career, in addition to travelling overseas to European leagues. Canada is one of the only countries which does not have a domestic pro league, for men or women.\n\n\"That was the only option at one point,\" Tatham said of leaving home to play in European leagues. \"Of course, the WNBA is an option but the WNBA is only during the summer, which is also during the national team season. So it's tough.\"\n\nWNBA opts out of player's agreement\n\nBut the ongoing discussion surrounding the lack of opportunity and exposure of Canadian female basketball players coincides with American athletes fighting for their own prosperity as well.\n\nBet On Women.

WNBA athletes see 22 per cent of league revenue as opposed to the NBA players receiving 50 per cent. And according to Forbes, the average salary in the WNBA is just under $72,000 US. The minimum salary of a NBA player starts at $582,180.\n\nNot that the WNBPA is looking to match salaries with NBA players; Tatham also appreciates that audiences typically prefer the men's game.\n\n\"I know a lot of people would love to watch men's ball. I mean its been that way since\u2026 I don't even know how long. Forever,\" she said. \"The NBA has been around way longer than the WNBA.

Now that she's retired and a coach, she talks about the realistic changes she'd like to see happen for the next generation of Canadian women's players. 2:43\n\nKey to supporting Canadian talent\n\nWhile women's basketball across all nations will always face comparisons with men's leagues, and the ensuing fight for their own piece of the pie, Tatham still insists getting Canada's national team in front of more eyeballs is the key to a strong foundation. She doesn't see a Canadian domestic pro-league in the cards anytime soon, but thinks a WNBA expansion team in the country could be successful, if Canadians already know what women's basketball has to offer.\n\n\"It would be pretty awesome,\" said Tatham of Canada's senior women's team getting on TV more regularly than just a world championships here, an Olympics there. \"That would be awesome to see, if we're at a big tournament, so that the country can kind of get that feeling that we have when we're playing for the team,\"\n\n\"I think that's a huge challenge and I'm hoping in the future that's going to start to change.\"\n\nAnd Canada's national women's team has earned the air time: since 2015, the team has has made multiple podium appearances, including defeating a dominant Team USA for gold at the 2015 Pan Am Games, and following up with another gold at the 2015 FIBA Americas women's championship. The team appeared in both the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics, and currently are ranked No. 5 in the world.\n\nWith all their success, Tatham knows Canada has incredible role models in the women's game, and in addition to how much the women's game is developing, she knows there's plenty of possibility.\n\nWatch Tamara Tatham describe her experience coaching male players:\n\nPart 1 of 3 from CBC Sports' conversation with Raptors 905 mentor coach Tamara Tatham, the first Canadian woman on the coaching staff of a pro, North American basketball team. 4:49\n\n\"Dynamic,\" Tatham said, lighting up when asked about the style of play in 2018. \"It's nice to see the speed, the athleticism, the smart play, it's really cool to watch women's basketball now.

He coincidentally served as a Canucks assistant coach to Willie Desjardins alongside Pearn from 2014 to 2017.\n\nSince those men have had job opportunities that Canada's female coaches don't currently, the question is how long they'll be with national women's team before returning to the men's pro game.\n\n\"I would probably be willing to make a commitment to the next Olympic Games,\" Pearn said. \"We haven't got to that stage with Hockey Canada.

The big question is how quickly the rate will rise.\n\nPoloz recently introduced the central bank's fifth interest rate hike in 15 months and warned Canadians, many of whom are carrying high levels of debt, to get used to the idea of three per cent interest rates as the new normal.\n\nIn prepared remarks of Poloz's speech Monday in the United Kingdom, he said the world economy has made considerable progress in shaking off the effects of the 2007-08 financial crisis.

But he argued these risks are two-sided and resolutions to disputes can provide fresh economic lifts.\n\n\"We have seen exactly this dynamic play out in Canada, as fears that [the North American Free Trade Agreement] would be torn up have been replaced with relief after agreement on the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"In general, it is not appropriate for a central bank to formulate policy based on only one side of a risk distribution.

(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nThe error was made in the monthly indexing calculation on disability awards and pensions and is believed to have started as far back as 2002.\n\nThe department didn't factor in the basic provincial tax credit for individuals. That led to lower monthly payments for 272,000 veterans \u2014 a significant number of them Second World War and Korean War veterans.\n\nAs many as 175,000 of them have since died, leaving the federal government with a legal mess to untangle related to their estates.\n\n\"It's going to be a challenge,\" Parent said.\n\nDepending upon individual circumstances, the ombudsman said, the error would have deprived veterans of between $50 and $2,000 during the timeframe.\n\n\"Those war veterans that are in low income and that receive the war allowance ... I mean, two thousand dollars is almost the equivalent of a monthly payment for them,\" the ombudsman said. \"It is significant for them.\"\n\nThe error ran unchecked from 2002 to 2010, according to internal department numbers analyzed by the ombudsman's staff.\n\nIn 2011, Veterans Affairs inexplicably resumed using the correct calculation.\n\nThe department did not, however, make any move to reimburse veterans for the lost income, which would have \u2014 in the worst cases \u2014 amounted to a few hundred dollars per month.\n\n\"We did not look really look at causes ... We did not look at the how or the why,\" said Parent. \"We discovered the error.

He said Olympic Games rarely stay on budget and once the cost overruns start adding up, affordable housing or other benefits for low-income earners are usually one of the first things to go.\n\n\"I understand the city is going to be on the hook for those cost overruns and they're going to have to make a decision, where are we going to have to cut back,\" he said.\n\nOrganizers of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games promised to build 252 affordable housing units as part of its Olympic village in the southeast False Creek area, but delivered half of that amount.\n\n\"There are different ways of encouraging affordable housing to be built, probably using the excuse of an Olympics to justify building affordable housing is probably going to result in very expensive and relatively few units being built,\" said Kneebone.\n\nThe bid corporation said while the 1,000 student units component has been dropped for a savings of $45 million, it is still planning to deliver on some of the other units.\n\n\"We have not removed any housing for low-income citizens, Indigenous peoples or seniors,\" said Beck.\n\nAthletes' village location a mystery\n\nThe athletes' village, which has been moved out of the Rivers District near Stampede Park, was expected to be a mix of market and non-market housing post-Games.\n\nAn artist's rendering of what the area around the existing Victoria Park bus barn might look like in the future.

In that year alone, the Region of Peel disbursed $429,142 of public money to the private daycare.\n\nSalma Sikder won her case Jan. 31 when an employment standards officer determined her former boss contravened several sections of the Employment Standards Act and awarded her a settlement of $9,057.52.\n\n\"I felt a bit shocked and financial stress and mental stress,\" said Sikder about not being paid for multiple pay periods in a row.\n\n\"If you don't get pay, if you have a family and you have to buy bread if you have to pay taxes\u2026 it's stressful.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Labour probe found Salma Sikder was entitled to unpaid wages for roughly 580 hours between May 1, 2017 and Aug. 23, 2017, totalling $8,752.50. She was also not properly paid for public holidays or vacation pay, bringing the total to $9,057.52, according to the Ministry of Labour decision. (Ministry of Labour decision)\n\nFrustration boils over after a year of waiting\n\nSikder's case is one of four Ministry of Labour decisions CBC Toronto has uncovered at the daycare. In each case, April Koster, the owner of Applewood Montessori Academy & Daycare Inc., was found to have contravened the rules.\n\nThe four women are owed $18,499.71 between them but, 10 months after the decisions, none of them have received the money, they say.\n\nSalma Sikder filed her Ministry of Labour claim in September 2017, and showed CBC Toronto the money still hasn\u2019t shown up in her bank accounts. (John Sandeman/CBC)\n\nSikder filed her Ministry of Labour claim in September 2017, and showed CBC Toronto the money still hasn't shown up in her bank accounts.\n\nSikder said she's \"feeling frustrated.\"\n\n\"It's been one year since I applied to the labour board. They are trying to collect, trying to negotiate with Applewood and Ms. April ... but I don't have any updates.\"\n\n\u200b \u200b \u200b\n\nCBC Toronto obtained four decisions against Applewood. In Sikder's decision, the employment standards officer wrote that Koster \"stated that she owes the claimant wages, but not the amount the claimant alleges. No other evidence was provided by the employer to dispute the allegations of the claimant.\"\n\n'I am not hiding from this debt,' daycare owner says\n\nIn a written statement to CBC Toronto, Koster wrote: \"There is no attempt to rip off employees. Businesses go through ups and downs and mine is no different and I am doing my best to resolve my issues as expeditiously as possible.\"\n\nKoster said in some cases the women lied but she chose not to appeal because \"it is not a good use of time.\"\n\n\"I am not hiding from this debt nor am I disputing it, I am paying it off as quickly as I can,\" said Koster. She said she has worked out a financial arrangement with the Ministry of Labour, but wouldn't provide proof.\n\n\u201cEveryone will get the money that they are owed,\u201d says April Koster, owner of Applewood. She says she is working with the Ministry of Labour to pay back women who won Employment Standards Act cases against her. (Chris Glover/CBC)\n\nSikder played CBC Toronto voicemail messages from the ministry's collections unit from this fall, which stated they had no updates for her.\n\nHowever, since CBC Toronto first started investigating the story, Sikder again reached out to collection services with the government, who confirmed Koster is working with them.\n\nSikder was told to call back in January for further updates.\n\n\"I am crossing my fingers and hoping I'll get it,\" Sikder said.\n\nConfusing partial payments cause headaches for workers\n\nThe employment standards officer found Koster paid $2,000 of those \"unpaid wages\" to Sikder during her employment. Partial payment was an overriding problem, CBC Toronto uncovered.\n\nShabana Akhtar worked at the daycare until Jun. 23, 2017. After complaining about missed wages directly to the owner, she was paid $901 in back pay during her employment, however the Ministry of Labour investigation found she should have been paid $3,363.75, according to the decision.\n\n\"Sometimes she used to pay in part. If she owed us $800 or $900, she would give us $500, or $200. So that's the habit, not only to me, all of our staff,\" Akhtar told CBC Toronto.\n\n\"Now I have lots of debt on me,\" she said.\n\n\"Because I cannot use my debit card, I use my credit card. Sometimes I didn't pay my bill on time, sometimes I didn't pay my rent. That's a problem.\"\n\nShortchanged with no termination pay, worker says\n\nOn June 23, 2017, Akhtar told Koster she couldn't be mistreated any longer and gave her verbal notice she was resigning on July 1, 2017.\n\nTo her surprise, Koster then gave her a written termination notice June 25, 2017, which was effective immediately.\n\n\"She never gave me any complaints \u2026 she never gave me any notice,\" said Akhtar.\n\nThe employment standards officer found Akhtar was not properly compensated for the termination and Koster was ordered to pay her $600 for that.\n\nOn Jan. 5 of this year, the Ministry of Labour probe determined Akhtar was owed $4,203.64. She said she has still not received it.\n\nAliya Janmohamed, 34, is owed $3,901.89 from Koster and she said the pay situation at the daycare was sketchy right from the beginning.\n\n\"My next paycheque was always being delayed, and delayed and delayed until I'm like, 'I'm fed up, I'm tired, I need my pay.' I earned that. I worked really hard,\" said Janmohamed.\n\nJanmohamed said Koster offered to give her cash under the table.\n\n\"I'm like, 'No, I want my actual e-transfer.'\"\n\n8 compliance orders against Applewood total $25,733.18\n\nFrom Jan. 1, 2015, until Aug. 23, 2018, CBC Toronto found there were 20 Employment Standards Claims against Applewood Montessori Academy & Daycare for issues including payment of wages, public holiday pay and termination pay.\n\nSeven claims were withdrawn, one was denied, four are still being investigated and eight compliance notices were ordered against Applewood totalling $25,733.18, according to the Ministry of Labour.\n\nOnce a case has been decided, the employer has 30 days to comply with the order or appeal. The body that handles those appeals, the Ontario Labour Relations Board, had no records of an appeal application from Applewood.\n\nAfter the 30-day period of no payment or no appeal, delinquent cases are handed over to a government collections unit.\n\n\"I'm worried because if people can't rely on the ministry, what can we do now? I mean ministries are there to help us, to give us what we earned,\" said Janmohamed.\n\n\"It's a lot of money and I'm glad I'm hopefully getting it soon ... I'm just praying it comes.\"\n\nMillions of lost wages not recovered for victims each year\n\nThe four women CBC Toronto spoke to are part of a bigger problem, according to records from the Ministry of Labour.\n\nFor example, in the 2017/18 fiscal year, Ministry of Labour officers assessed $25.7 million worth of claims, however only $20 million was recovered, which might include claims from previous years.\n\nThe Minister of Labour oversees the Employment Standards Act and the Minister of Finance oversees the collections agency recouping delinquent funds. CBC Toronto sent both ministers requests to explain what more could be done, such as garnishing employers' income, or repossessing assets.\n\n\"We want people to be paid as soon as possible wages that they are [owed],\" said Labour Minister Laurie Scott, \"so we can look at the ministry of finance to see about the collections.\"\n\nAssociation worries workers \"exploited\" while public money is involved\n\nAlana Powell, the interim co-ordinator with the Association of Early Childhood Educators of Ontario, said the association is not aware of such an \"extreme situation\" involving people who work at daycares.\n\n\"I think my first gut reaction was probably shock,\" said Powell. \"The fact that early childhood educators and the Child Care Workforce are being exploited is obviously really problematic for a lot of reasons.\"\n\nAlana Powell, with the Association of Early Childhood Educators, was shocked to learn of the decisions by the Ministry of Labour and is concerned about how much public money is involved. (Chris Glover/CBC)\n\nShe found it especially concerning that Applewood would be found to have skipped wages and not followed other Employment Standards Act rules after accepting nearly $850,000 in government subsidies from 2015 to 2018.\n\n\"If public funding is being misused to make profits again that's something we'd be really, really concerned about,\" said Powell.", "Ontario Premier Doug Ford shuffled his months-old cabinet early Monday following the swift departure of a longtime Progressive Conservative legislator.\n\nJim Wilson resigned from his post as minister of economic development, job creation and trade on Friday to seek treatment for addiction issues.

The department that oversees the unit would not provide anyone for an interview, sending an emailed statement instead.\n\n\"By design, off-road vehicles do not provide significant occupant protection, and therefore they do pose an element of risk,\" spokesperson Geoffrey Downey wrote.\n\n\"This is why we strongly encourage operators to follow all safety regulations, respect any posted speed limits and to never drive while impaired.\"\n\nA lack of political will\n\nNew Brunswick's 2001 ATV task force also called for enhanced enforcement.\n\nBut the provincial government didn't act on most of the task force's recommendations because of a lack of political will, according to trails advocate David Peterson. He was part of the task force.\n\nCBC News analyzed reams of data and spoke with dozens of families.

(Trevor Lyons/CBC)\n\nPolice determined that alcohol was not a factor in the accident that killed Roger Burns. But drug or alcohol intoxication is a frequent factor in ATV and snowmobile deaths.\n\nAlcohol and drugs were suspected or confirmed in 44 per cent of fatalities across the region.\n\nIn Nova Scotia the figure was 51 per cent. That included five Nova Scotia riders who tested positive for drugs such as marijuana and cocaine, out of six cases of drug intoxication for all of Atlantic Canada.\n\nDr. Rob Green with Trauma Nova Scotia says most patients in ATV and snowmobile accidents die as a result of a traumatic brain injury.

The information came mostly from media reports and interviews with victims' friends and family.\n\nCBC tried to contact a person familiar with each case. Those inquiries concluded roughly a quarter involved striking an obstacle on a road or trail, such as trees, rocks, embankments, poles or buildings.\n\nAs risky as cars\n\nDr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, says ATVs are just as risky as cars, but people fail to see them that way.\n\nHe wants that to change.\n\n\"We have a collectively casual societal approach,\" said Strang. \"We know that people are much more likely to consume alcohol and get on an ATV or a snowmobile and they wouldn't do that in a car.\"\n\nThe first step in tackling the problem, said Strang, is talking with ATV users and groups about why this casual culture exists.\n\nHe also wants more research done on how many people have not only been killed on ATVs or snowmobiles, but been injured.\n\n\"We have to remember that deaths are only the tip of the iceberg,\" he said.", "Weeks into national cannabis legalization, a top RCMP officer says the tests being used to detect whether someone is driving high are \"not there yet,\" though they're the best they've got.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Fifth Estate, Chief Supt. Dennis Daley admitted that, although parts of the current assessment are based on science, the tests themselves will be always be subjective.\n\n\"It's important for Canadians to realize that we don't have a tool right now, a similar on the alcohol side, a machine that will actually print out something that says 'you are this, you are that.' We do not have that,\" says Daley.\n\n\"As the science improves, the technology no doubt will follow.\"\n\nStarting at midnight on Oct. 17 law enforcement agencies across the country ramped up efforts to nab cannabis-impaired drivers and began handing out hefty fines for violations of the Cannabis Act.\n\nRoadside sobriety tests\n\nIn order to assess whether or not drivers are high, police officers are relying on standard field sobriety tests and their own trained Drug Recognition Experts (DREs). If a driver is thought to be impaired, he or she is put through a roadside standard field sobriety test (SFST) that includes an eye examination, the walk and turn test and one leg stand test.\n\nChief Supt. Dennis Daley says there is not yet a tool, as there is with alcohol, to test for drug-impaired driving. (Andrew Lee/CBC)\n\nUpon failing the test, the driver is brought to the station where a specialized DRE officer runs the driver through a 12-step process designed to detect impairment. The steps include taking clinical indicators (blood pressure, body temperature, pulse) and additional eye exams such as measuring your pupil size in different lighting conditions. Failure, or refusal to comply, with the field sobriety test or the DRE demand can also result in criminal charges that have the same penalties as impaired driving.\n\nThe RCMP runs the Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) program for all police officers in Canada and has trained 833 DREs across Canada. The Mounties have trained these specialized front-line officers and have 25 certification events planned this year, followed by an additional 25 to come.\n\nStill early days for saliva test\n\nAlthough the Department of Justice approved the use of the Drager DrugTest 5000, a handheld device that tests saliva for THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, not everyone is convinced of its reliability.\n\nSeveral cities across Canada, including Ottawa, have decided against using the device due to the questions being raised about the machine's accuracy, especially in cold weather. Some RCMP detachments have bought saliva testing units, but others are waiting until the device is proven reliable and its findings are tested in court.\n\nAn investigation by The Fifth Estate at the beginning of the year highlighted problems with the DRE program being used in Canada as well as in the United States.\n\nRecent studies show that, although drug recognition experts are effective in being able to tell the category of drug someone may have consumed, they fall short in reliably confirming impairment.\n\nDaley agrees that the test is subjective and does open doors to the possibility that sometimes the police can get it wrong, however he believes it contributes to keeping roads safe.\n\n\"I do not believe that any police officer starts off their shift by saying 'I want to make somebody's life difficult today.' We are human beings, we are faced with a particular situation, we rely on our training and our experience in order to hopefully do the right thing.\"\n\nStronger message needed for youth\n\nIn February last year the Supreme Court of Canada upheld DREs to assist the court in providing opinion towards the ability to drive a motor vehicle impaired. The case involved a cannabis-impaired driver who was acquitted in a lower court because of doubt over such expert testimony.\n\nAn Ottawa police stops a driver to check for signs of impairment. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\nIn a statement to The Fifth Estate, Minister of Border Security and Organized Crime Reduction Bill Blair said he is confident these new measure will save lives.\n\n\"Our government is making the necessary investments and supporting law enforcement with measures including a very successful 'Don't Drive High' public awareness campaign,\" Blair said in the statement.\n\nHowever, Daley is concerned that the awareness campaign may not be working. \"It doesn't appear youth are getting the message of driving while high,\" he said.\n\nA Statistics Canada survey this summer found youth and young adults aged 15 to 24 were twice as likely as older Canadians to have ridden in a car driven by a potentially impaired driver,\n\n\"We have to concentrate on messages with respect to cannabis and driving much like 30 years ago we increased the education around alcohol-impaired driving.\"", "Canadians who thought political and economic turmoil south of the border had reached a peak may be in for a surprise after tomorrow's midterm elections.\n\nUntil all the votes are counted, no one can be sure where the chips will fall, but there is increasing evidence that President Donald Trump's Republican Party could lose control of the House of Representatives.\n\nAnti-Trump Canadians may be breathing a sigh of relief at the prospect, but some Canadian policy experts say a Democratic win is not necessarily better for the Canadian economy or Canadian business.\n\nAnd even if the Republicans manage to hold on to both the House and the Senate, the increasing clash of ideologies stoked by the bitter campaign could create lasting divisions that will continue to plague Canada-U.S. economic relations.\n\nClashing ideologies\n\nThose who find the current election process confusing would do well to read CBC Washington correspondent Matt Kwong's \"primer on why November's elections matter.\"\n\nBut the shorter version is that in an already fractured U.S. political system, there is a good chance the body that passes the laws \u2014 the House of Representatives \u2014 will flip from Republican to Democratic Party control and thus be in direct opposition to Trump's executive branch, which runs the country and enforces the laws.\n\nA nation, even households divided.

U.S. spending and borrowing policy affects bond rates and the value of the dollar.\n\n\"There may be centrist legislators left but they dare not admit it,\" says Hart, who believes Democrats are raring for a fight.\n\n\"If Congress does go Democratic and they select Nancy Pelosi again, you have someone who,\" Hart pauses, \"lacks wisdom, let's put it that way.\"\n\nDemocratic supporters would no doubt beg to differ, but the discord that Hart predicts could spell the end of not only any future pro-Trump legislation, but also the end of the new U.S-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) that Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has been struggling over since Trump threatened to throw out the North America Free Trade Agreement.\n\nAfter more than a year of negotiating, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was finally reached. But experts say a divided Congress might fail to approve it. (Edgard Garrido/Reuters)\n\n\"Now that we have this replacement agreement, it's not a sure thing it will pass through Congress,\" Hart says.\n\nBesides the possibility anti-Trump Democrats see USMCA as the president's baby, Hart says the new deal is actually more restrictive on trade than NAFTA.\n\nOddly enough, the effect of rejecting USMCA would be to keep NAFTA in place. But University of Saskatchewan public policy expert Daniel B\u00e9land, who has worked and studied in the U.S., says that ostensible trade continuity may be of little reassurance to business if it merely raises the ire of Trump and his supporters.\n\nHe says the inflamed rhetoric of the campaign is pulling the two sides into more radical opposition, adding to the business uncertainty of where the U.S. goes next.\n\n\"It's really a division that's not just political anymore,\" says B\u00e9land, Canada Research Chair in public policy. \"You watch MSNBC and Fox News and you think you live on two different planets.\"\n\nHe is worried that growing anger over issues such as immigration and trade could exacerbate the kind of violence we have already seen, as each side speaks exclusively to its own supporters, leading to yet greater uncertainty. In the case of Trump, unlike in the campaign that elected him, he does not have Hillary Clinton as a focus for his attacks.\n\n\"His foe is quite abstract,\" B\u00e9land says. \"It's liberals or immigrants or specific target groups.\"\n\nAnd with a Democrat-controlled House, frustration could push more zealous Trump devotees into greater extremism against their adversaries, real or imagined.\n\nOil and gas backlash\n\nAnother area where Canadian business interests could suffer is on environmental issues, says Bessma Momani, a specialist in financial and foreign policy at Waterloo's Balsillie School of International Affairs.\n\nAppealing to a more environmentally conscious, urban electorate, a Democratic House could lead to a backlash against Canadian oil and gas projects, including the oilsands and pipelines such as Keystone, which are necessary to get Canadian oil to market.\n\n\"I think there's a risk there,\" Momani says.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump at a rally in Illinois last week.

These are practitioners without medical degrees who are calling themselves \"family doctors\" or even experts in the field of oncology, and some imply in their marketing materials that they have graduated medical school.This sort of labelling contravenes regulations in other provinces, too.\n\n'Medically trained. Naturally focused'\n\nAnd yet, we can hardly blame individual naturopaths for misinformation when their representative organizations model the same behaviour. In 2016, the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors adopted the tagline \"Medically trained. Naturally focused.\"\n\nThe Ontario Association of Naturopathic Doctors confidently notes on its website that, like most medical schools, naturopathic school is four years long, with students learning basic science and racking up 1,200 hours of supervised clinical study. This supports claims like those of one Ontario naturopath, who states on her website that naturopathic doctors (NDs) and MDs \"get similar levels of training\" that are \"almost identical.\"\n\nHowever, medical students amass, by conservative estimates, about 4,000 hours of supervised clinical study \u2014 most of which is in the hospital, not a naturopathic office. More importantly, all doctors undergo years of residency training after they get their MD. In the time between graduating medical school and becoming a family doctor, I accrued at least 6,000 additional hours of supervised clinical study. Many of my colleagues train for far longer. If the comparison is to a newly minted MD, then it's highly deceptive to omit the fact that an MD alone does not a doctor make.\n\nTo be sure, naturopathic education does involve basic science and clinical skills, but it's unquestionably false advertising to claim that this represents \"medical training.\" Many health professionals complete multi-year programs where students memorize anatomy, see patients in supervised settings and get tested on clinical skills. That's not \"medical\" training \u2014 it's the essential background for almost everyone in health care. And just like \"dentistry\" and \"nursing\" are clear and unambiguous ways to describe one's background, so too should \"naturopathy\" be a sufficient descriptor. The only reason to start throwing the term \"medical\" around is to deliberately sow confusion about your education.\n\nFive provinces (B.C. Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario) have naturopathic colleges that regulate the profession and are mandated to protect the public. This past summer, Alberta surgeon Dr. Carrie Kollias contacted the College of Naturopathic Doctors of Alberta about a naturopath claiming to have \"recently graduated from medical school.\" They replied that this was \"not in any way misleading\" because his website listed the naturopathic school he attended. But patients shouldn't be required to fact check their provider's background. Using the terms \"naturopathic\" and \"medical\" as if they are interchangeable is a bait and switch designed to confuse. Condoning this behaviour as a regulator is a dereliction of duty.\n\nProviding informed consent\n\nPatients need straightforward information about their providers. The spread of misinformation targeting people interested in alternative health demands the attention of our medical regulators. If you're misled about the education of your provider, then that provider does not have your fully informed consent. And since informed consent is a basic health care right, this isn't just a patient safety issue \u2014 it's a patient autonomy issue as well.\n\nTwo concerned physicians, Dr. Quynh Nguyen-Giang and Dr. Linda LeBlanc from Ontario and New Brunswick respectively, have been writing letters to the provincial medical colleges and health ministries, urging them to address this issue. They're also hoping to create an online registry where anyone can report provider misrepresentation. This will help expedite complaints, allow for a more organized response and track the extent of the problem. It's a commendable grassroots effort in light of a mostly lacklustre response from medical regulators.\n\nInstitutional lack of concern\n\nWhile New Brunswick's medical college has launched a legal challenge against several naturopaths for their false advertising, other regulators seem downright uninterested \u2014 at least in response to appeals from Drs. Nguyen-Giang and LeBlanc. Just like rules around naturopathy vary from province to province, so too does the apparent concern evinced by the medical colleges, with some refusing to even address this problem.\n\nSo if we can't reliably count on the medical and naturopathic colleges to take this seriously, then the government must step in. Issues of patient safety \u2013 particularly ones in which laws are being openly flouted \u2013 are too important to ignore. Our health ministries need to start pushing back against misrepresentation, challenge naturopathic organizations that promote misinformation and enforce the rules around false health advertising. Expecting this to be solved by a professional turf war is irresponsible. The government owes the public real and tangible efforts to protect accuracy in health provider information.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

(Chris Sorensen/University of Toronto)\n\n\"Most adults who are afraid [of needles] stay under the radar,\" said Anna Taddio, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Toronto and a senior associate scientist at Sick Kids hospital. \"They don't talk about it, but their avoidance behaviour has an impact on their health care.\"\n\nIt can also have some potentially huge consequences on public health.\n\nAvoidance of vaccines can lead to greater transmission of illnesses or pathogens in the community, the postponing of blood tests can lead to diagnosis delays, people may dodge dental work until a crisis happens, or they may refuse to donate blood \u2014 all due to a fear of needles.\n\nFear often linked to childhood\n\nAt first glance, 48-year-old Dennis Gillis doesn't seem like someone who would have a needle phobia. But the engineer, longtime runner and father of three has lived since childhood with a fear of needles, which is formally known as trypanophobia.\n\n\"Something [traumatic] happened when I was four or five years old, and needles have been a source of huge anxiety since,\" said Gillis. \"I even used to pass out.\"\n\nThat fear has made the Halifax man avoid flu shots for decades, and his blood work requisitions have been collecting dust.\n\nAccording to Taddio, a traumatic experience between the ages of four and eight is \"the typical scenario behind a fear of needles.\"\n\nChildren in Canada receive about a dozen vaccinations before the age of six. For many, the fear of needles links back to a traumatic experience in childhood. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTaddio, an expert in children's pain, is currently leading an interdisciplinary team studying pain management during vaccination. She recently received a $1 million grant to support her ongoing research into how to reduce fear of needles in youth.\n\nMuch of the research on the memory of pain and trauma explores how fears can develop in childhood, and get reinforced in adulthood through behaviours like avoidance.\n\n\"What avoidance does, in the long term, is to fuel the fear and makes it worse. Most adults with needle fear can link it to a bad childhood experience,\" said Dr. Melanie Noel, a psychologist and assistant professor at the University of Calgary whose research is focused on children's anxiety and memories of pain.\n\n\"Research shows that when you are scared of something, like needles, it will increase the pain you feel. The pain becomes worse in your memory than it was during the procedure.\"\n\nBut if that pain is managed properly, she said \"you are more likely to buffer the negative memories, and create less scary memories.\"\n\nThe importance of pain-management tools\n\nAlthough almost all scientific literature about the prevention and management of needle phobia involves children, Noel says there is no reason to think that topical creams and anxiety-control methods, such as relaxation, meditation and distraction, couldn't help adults too. The research has simply not been done yet.\n\nMany barriers stand in the way of convincing people of the importance of managing needle-related pain and anxiety, Noel said.\n\n\"The societal view is that it is just a little poke, suck it up. There is an expectation that adults should just deal with it,\" she said. \"But most did not acquire any tools when they were kids, so now that they have control and agency, they avoid needles.\"\n\n\"I have been accused of creating a generation of wimps,\" said Dr. Christine Chambers, a clinical psychologist and professor at Dalhousie University, who has done extensive work in the field of pediatric pain, including around needles specifically.\n\nUsing props, like a pinwheel, during a needle procedure can both distract a child and teach them breathing techniques to cope with pain or anxiety. (David Laughlin/CBC)\n\nChambers was the driving force behind the \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt\" campaign, which launched in 2013 with a goal of improving pain management for children.\n\nChambers is currently collecting data on coping strategies used by adults during needle procedures to fill what she says is a gap in the research.\n\n\"There is a difference between managing pain and fear,\" she said, noting that already-available solutions often aren't used.\n\n\"Once a person develops pathological anxiety, pain management strategies will stop working. There are treatments for needle phobia, too, but few people realize it can be treated.\"\n\nWhile some patients fear the pain, others fear the needle itself, says Taddio, who suggests that the phobia should be addressed head on.\n\n\"The best way to approach someone is to ask: 'What exactly are you afraid of?'\" she said. \"To treat people with dignity, offer them some control over the procedure, and make the whole experience more pleasant to gain their trust back.\"\n\nTechniques to try\n\nNoel suggests health-care providers can do three things \u2014 before, during and after an injection \u2014 to help with needle anxiety.\n\n\"Offer relaxation, to give the tools [they need] to feel in control. Manage the pain, to help with the pain experienced and buffer the scary memories. And reframe the memory by asking positively focused questions, showing the control the person had [at the time] and catching exaggeration,\" she said.\n\nSlow, deep breathing, the use of guided imagery (such as visualizing a happy place), and distraction tools (like playing a game on a smartphone) are all simple techniques that can help decrease the anxiety and pain associated with a needle procedure.\n\nParents also can guide their children through some of those techniques, using props like pinwheels, bubbles, books and tablets.\n\nNeed techniques to overcome your fear of needles? This psychologist shows you a few options:\n\nDr. Lindsay Uman of the IWK Health Centre\u2019s complex pain team shows a patient distraction and relaxation techniques. 2:42\n\nAfter all, pain and trauma-free needle experiences in childhood, combined with education on coping strategies, will go a long way toward helping future generations not be afraid of getting their necessary shots later in life.\n\nAs for Gillis, he said \"mindfulness meditation, counting and focusing on my breathing\" is what best helps him when it comes to needles. \"I can now get annual blood work and a flu shot without passing out.\"\n\nBecoming a father has also changed his priorities, he said, as he realized he had to get over his fear so he could stay healthy for his children.\n\n\"I used to wake up to people panicking around me because I had passed out \u2014 not prepared to help, calling 911,\" Gillis said. \"But no one ever asked me: 'Are you afraid of needles?'\"\n\nSituations like that only fed his anxiety, he said, making it worse for the next time he faced a needle.\n\nAs with many medical issues, prevention is often the best medicine.", "Battling drug addiction as a teenager caused Jay Arruda to overdose, be kicked out of his parents' house and lose his job. All of that ultimately led him to a \"sober bar\" in Windsor that helped save his life.\n\n\"Some days it's just a sober party and I never thought recovery could be this fun,\" said Arruda.\n\nThat's how he describes the Spiritual Soldier Coffee Compound. The shop has been open for nearly five months and is run by two men who battled addiction themselves. They want it to serve as a safe haven for anyone trying to stay sober.\n\n\"I don't know where I would be if I didn't have this place.

He had trouble fitting in along with some self-esteem issues. When he finally found a group of friends, they happened to smoke weed.\n\nFrom there, Arruda did what he calls \"people pleased\" and began smoking pot too. That turned into cocaine, which led him to his drugs of choice \u2014 Oxycontin and fentanyl.\n\n\"That's when it started to get out of hand, around the 12th grade,\" said Arruda.\n\nNine months sober\n\nHe's now 21 years old and nearly nine months sober after accepting help and attending a treatment facility for about three months.\n\n\"I actually turned 21 when I was in the treatment centre and it happened to be the best birthday of my life \u2014 I could remember it,\" said Arruda.\n\nJay Arruda is nearly nine months sober and attributes some of that to the Spiritual Soldier Coffee Compound, which he describes as a fun environment with supported people. (Jason Viau/CBC)\n\nMuch of his success can be attributed to the Spiritual Soldier Coffee Compound, he said, and the owners Mike Brown and James Lucier, who both have had their own struggles with drugs and addiction.\n\nThe cafe received referrals from hospitals, nurses and even withdrawal management services.\n\n\"We've had a lot of people come in here who have said 'I want help. I want to make a change in my life,'\" said Brown. \"I mean Jay is living proof of it. I mean, it's unbelievable to see because when we first saw him, it was not pretty. But we saw ourselves in him.\"\n\nIt's like a dream come true. It helps me every day. - Jay Arruda\n\nArruda describes the coffee compound as a place with good vibes, music, full of smiles and a group of people with a common goal of staying sober.\n\nYou can find him behind the counter sometimes, working part-time. But even when he's not on the clock, Arruda just hangs out with a smile on his face because \"you can never be sad in this place.\"\n\n\"It's like a dream come true. It helps me every day,\" said Arruda.\n\n'I'm not going to be that guy'\n\nBut all of this didn't come before hitting rock bottom.

The near-death moment \"woke me up a bit.\"\n\nOn top of that, his dad died of an overdose when he was younger, due to addiction.\n\n\"It's very hard. I even told myself I'm never going to do drugs, I'm not going to be that guy,\" said Arruda. \"I believe I was even worse than my dad. I was just as close to dying as anybody else.\"\n\nLooking down the road, into the future, Arruda wants to start attending school in September to one day become an addictions counsellor.\n\nIt's a way he'll be able to share his story and help others \u2014 something he said his mom is proud to see.\n\nAnd now, his family visits the coffee compound to celebrate Arruda's success.\n\n\"My nanna comes in here all the time and she leaves crying because she just can't believe her grandson is here, and he's sober,\" said Arruda.", "Companies that have embraced waste reduction as part of their business strategy will share the secrets of their success at a conference in Vancouver this week.\n\nIt's been described as the \"circular economy\" and it's a business trend that's as much about the bottom line as it is about sustainability.\n\nIn recent years, large retail brands such as IKEA and clothing designer Eileen Fisher have embarked on campaigns that urge customers to reuse and recycle their products, from setting up recycling depots for used furniture to encouraging customers to return used clothing.\n\nMore than 500 people are expected to attend the Zero Waste Conference on Thursday and Friday at the Vancouver Convention Centre. The conference, now in its eighth year, is founded by Metro Vancouver in collaboration with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the National Zero Waste Council.\n\n\"Businesses are certainly increasingly expected to be considering sustainability and responsibility in everything they're doing,\" said Christie Stephenson, executive director of the University of British Columbia's Peter P. Dhillon Centre for Business Ethics.\n\n\"I think that's a trend that's only gong to pick up steam.\"\n\nMunicipalities and other governments with bulging landfills are pushing back on producers to create less waste. (Jacob Barker/CBC)\n\nStephenson said customers and stakeholders concerned about the fate of the planet are driving sustainability initiatives, as are cities and other governments dealing with bulging landfills.\n\nBut companies that embrace the sustainability trend find that it has financial benefits as well.\n\nFor starters, research from the Conference Board of Canada indicates that companies with an explicit social purpose like sustainability as part of their mandate have more loyal customers and better employee retention.\n\nSome companies are creating new revenue streams from reselling their used products. Others are saving costs on materials in the long-term by recycling old items.\n\nThe circular economy is all about reshaping business models to reduce and reuse waste and return it into the production cycle.\n\n\"The circular economy is sort of business innovation at its best. It's an efficient use of resources,\" Stephenson said. \"Business are seeing that there is a business expectation that translates to a business case.\"\n\nWaste as a resource\n\nBrendan Seale, head of Sustainability for IKEA Canada, will be at the conference this week to share his company's long-term sustainability strategy.\n\nSeale said IKEA plans to become a full zero waste business by 2030. To do this, it's looking at product design \u2014 it intends to use more recycled materials. It's thinking about using materials that are more easily recyclable and can be added back into its supply chain.\n\n\"We don't really think of waste as such. We really think of materials as resources and how we can maximize the value of those things,\" Seale said.\n\nStephanie Betrtels, a professor at Simon Fraser University's Beedie School of Business, points out that raw materials are becoming increasingly expensive and hard to access.\n\n\"As we need more and more materials to make more stuff, we're going to run out of those materials,\" Bertels said.\n\nAdding business opportunities\n\nSome IKEA locations in Europe have recycling locations on site where customers can drop off furniture that's broken or that they no longer need. Seale hinted that the same service may be coming to Canada.\n\nThe recycling centres provide another touch point with customers \u2014 when they come in, they may choose to browse for more products to buy.\n\nSustainability could be considered a tricky subject for a company synonymous to some for cheap goods that aren't known to last long. But Seale counters that stereotype by pointing to another one of IKEA's sustainability initiatives: dipping into the used goods market.\n\nWe're not sure whether we believe in ghosts, but we definitely believe furniture deserves a second chance.

The company has partnered with second-hand online listing service Kijiji to highlight IKEA products for sale on the platform.\n\nIKEA also sees the second-hand market as a business opportunity to expand its product line to include more secondary items that could spruce up older ones, like sofa slipcovers.\n\nBuilding brands\n\nThe second-hand market is a large part of clothing designer and manufacturer Eileen Fisher's sustainability initiatives.\n\nMegan Arnaud, the company's retail leader for its Renew take-back program, will also be speaking at the conference next week.\n\nThe program accepts used clothes from its customers. The ones in good condition are resold, while the tarnished ones are either mended or disassembled for their raw materials.\n\n\"Our product is made with high-quality materials. There's a lot of care that goes into the sourcing and production of our pieces,\" Arnaud said from her Seattle office.\n\n\"And so we want to harness those materials as resources that can be remade to start their journey all over again.\"\n\nGiven the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s alarming findings that we have only 12 years to limit catastrophic climate change, we want you to know we\u2019re doing our part to reduce our emissions and offset our energy consumption. <a href=\"https://t.co/ldxKpB1x5k\">pic.twitter.com/ldxKpB1x5k</a> \u2014@EILEENFISHERNY\n\nSFU's Stephanie Bertels said the driver for these types of programs isn't entirely altruistic. Companies like Eileen Fisher can use buy-back programs to reinforce their brand as high-quality and timeless.\n\nAs Arnaud points out herself, it's good for business. Arnaud said the resale wing of the Renew program is a significant source of revenue.\n\n\"This is becoming a viable part of the business. We're producing revenues that show that this program has a future.\"", "Midterm elections for Democratic or Republican control of the House of Representatives will play out in polling booths across the U.S. on Tuesday, but much of the attention will be on a few key, highly competitive seats \u2014 including Ohio's 12th congressional district.\n\nThe vote is to some degree a referendum on the U.S. president, says political scientist Paul Beck. As a result, Ohio's 12th district, \"though it's a district that is majority Republican, still it makes it a competitive race.\"\n\nThe district has a long history of electing Republicans. The party has held it since 1983, and President Donald Trump won it by 11 percentage points in 2016.\n\nHowever, a special election held here in August morphed into a closely contested race. Republican candidate Troy Balderson won by only 0.8 per cent of the vote, and it was so close that it took weeks after election day before the results were made official, as all absentee ballots were counted.\n\nThe Republicans scratched out a win in an election that was never expected to be tight. And now the Ohio 12th is what some U.S. polling sites describe as a toss-up district in the midterms.\n\nCook Political Report suggests the district is so close it could go either way. And until recently, the influential political number-crunching site FiveThirtyEight described the district as a toss-up, although in recent days it has nudged the district's standing closer to a Republican win.\n\nGiven the potential for a close race, The National visited Westerville, a suburb outside the city of Columbus, and gathered six ordinary American voters to talk politics at nearby Otterbein University. The diverse group included business owners, a radiologist, a retired school teacher, a lawyer and a mental health counsellor.\n\nThree people in the group support the president, three do not. Beyond that, the discussion got more complicated in terms of party affiliations and opinions on national issues, indicating the depth of the so-called American divide.\n\nThe National gathered a diverse group of Ohio voters to talk politics ahead of the midterms.

He says he was going to reform taxes, he reformed taxes. He says he was going to deregulate, he deregulated. And our economy is thriving because of that.\"\n\nSteve Cuckler, left, is a hardline Republican and Trump supporter from Appalachian Ohio.

We need our politicians to be statesmen. The whole tenor of Trump's style of leadership leads us in the wrong direction.\"\n\nBeck, the political scientist, made special note of this gender gap. Although the Ohio district has historically been majority Republican, he expects a competitive race precisely because suburban, well-educated women like Oehler are turning away from Trump's manner.\n\nWe're seeing a larger gender gap than we have ever seen in American elections. - Paul Beck, political scientist\n\n\"Parts of the district include people with higher levels of education. Those are the people who have been less satisfied with the Trump presidency, and that's particularly true among women,\" Beck says.\n\n\"In fact, we're seeing a larger gender gap with women voting or professing to vote Democratic, and men professing to vote Republican \u2026 than we have ever seen in American elections.\"\n\nDavia Stevenson, an African American and mental health counsellor who supports the Democrats, says the first two years of Trump's mandate have been deeply upsetting.\n\n\"He is incredibly polarizing \u2026 it's certainly given permission for racism, for the overt expression of racism,\" she says.\n\nDavia Stevenson says she does not support Trump's border policies, but also doesn't have an answer to the immigration problem. 'It is complex and it is nuanced, but it's being presented as us against them. They're bad, we're good. It is far more complex than that.' (Marc Robichaud/CBC)\n\nStevenson recounts an experience she had one night soon after the presidential election, while walking her dog in her suburban neighbourhood.\n\n\"A car comes by, so I lean in and I was yelled at, 'Go back to Africa, you black B.' This is on my street in my neighbourhood that I've lived in for 17 years. I was so shocked, I wasn't sure it happened. I didn't tell my husband for weeks because I thought 'I'm going nuts. That did not happen,'\" Stevenson says.\n\nWhile listening to Stevenson, Steve Cuckler shakes his head. He is a lawyer, hardline Republican and a Trump supporter who grew up in a low-income region of America and put himself through school.\n\n\"First I want to acknowledge I'm sorry to hear about that. That can't be tolerated,\" Cuckler says.\n\nThen he adds, \"We all have life experiences. I grew up in southeast Ohio \u2026 Appalachian Ohio is actually the poorest part of anywhere in the United States.\n\n\"Where I grew up, we've been wanting someone like President Trump since I was a kid, to recognize the greatness of our country, to instill pride in our country.\"\n\nSelect moments from Trump's presidency were played back for the group, including an Oct. 16 tweet critics say was demeaning to women:\n\n\"I don't think Donald Trump respects women,\" says Republican-leaning Oehler, in response to the tweet.\n\n\"He's clearly shown that time and again, other than maybe his daughter. Although that's kind of creepy too, some of the things he says about Ivanka. I keep thinking hopefully Ivanka will take his phone away from him and stop him from tweeting, because particularly if you support him, he does more harm with these crazy tweets.\"\n\nWhile Oehler sees a president with a combustible persona, Foos says he believes Trump is a leader who is simply responding in kind.\n\nTom Foos calls Donald Trump, 'an equal-opportunity abuser or praiser ... I think the substance of what he's doing as president overrides somewhat questionable style sometimes.' (Marc Robichaud/CBC)\n\n\"I think he treats all people the same. I think he's an equal-opportunity abuser or praiser, depending on who you are. If you punch him, he's going to punch you back hard whether you're a woman, a man, no matter what your race is, no matter what your ethnicity is. He's going to come at you,\" Foos says.\n\n\"He is what he is. I'm a substance-over-style kind of person. I think the substance of what he's doing as president overrides somewhat questionable style sometimes.\"\n\nStill, Oehler \u2014 who agrees with Foos on most economic issues \u2013 says she finds it hard to see past Trump's style.\n\n\"If he worked in any company in America, he couldn't talk to people that way. He couldn't treat people that way. And to have the person who, you know, is our representative to the rest of the world act that way is embarrassing as an American.\"\n\nImmigration\n\nImmigration and border issues have been handled by the White House in ways that tend to fire up Trump's supporters and inflame his critics.\n\nThe group was asked to review a recent speech where Trump offered remarks on the caravan of migrants from Central America that is heading towards the U.S. border.\n\nPresident Trump said: \"I think some bad people started that caravan. More importantly, or maybe almost as importantly, you have some very, very bad people in the caravan. You have some very tough criminal elements within the caravan. But I will seal off the border before they come into this country and I'll bring out our military. Not our reserves, I'll bring out our military.\"\n\nMary Oehler, right, tells The National's discussion group that she has issues with how the president portrays immigrants as criminals. 'We need to have control of our borders, but that doesn't mean we need to turn everyone away.' (Carmen Merrifield/CBC)\n\nAsked whether the president was politicizing the migrants' plight, Foos says, \"We are not against immigration, we are against illegal immigration.\n\n\"Illegal immigration is bad for the illegal immigrants. They get exploited. They're not getting paid a fair wage. They're not being taken care of. The journey here to the United States is very dangerous ... we have a great need for labour in this country, okay, and it's gonna help people achieve some of their dreams. But it's got to be done legally.\"\n\nOehler takes issue with Trump portraying immigrants as dangerous.\n\n\"He doesn't know who those people are, so I mean how can he say that they're all criminals? We need to have control of our borders but that doesn't mean we need to turn everyone away. I don't think you should be separating parents from children, I don't think you can just blanket turn people away.\"\n\nShe adds, \"I do think you need to figure out who people are and go through the process to decide who we are going to accept as refugees. But he wants to make it, again, the politics of identity. We're turning them away because of where they're coming from.\"\n\nDemocrat Stevenson concedes she does not support Trump's policies, but also doesn't have the answer to the immigration problem.\n\n\"I think what I'm up against is that it is complex and it is nuanced, but it's being presented as us against them. They're bad, we're good. It is far more complex than that. If it wasn't, then we would have some sort of a solution.\"\n\nNational divide\n\nThe U.S. is a divided nation heading toward a crucial midterm election.

He says it makes gatherings with his hard-core Republican family awkward. (Marc Robichaud/CBC)\n\n\"My dad is 91, a hardline Republican. I call my sister a Fox Republican \u2014 you know, that [Fox news] is all she repeats. That's their belief. And they think, 'You married a mid-Western woman, live in Ohio, what happened?'\" says Medrano.\n\nHe adds that broaching politics when he gets together with family is difficult.\n\n\"I will tell you, with my sister, we just don't talk about it. We just don't have a conversation. Or my dad says, 'Please, let's not have that conversation.'\"\n\nStevenson sympathizes, although her experience with America's expanding social and political divisions is more personally threatening.\n\n\"You cannot have a conversation where you avoid Trump \u2026 because he is such a polarizing figure,\" Stevenson says. \"And it is scary for me to say, in the country that I love, that I fear on a regular [basis] for my sons \u2026 I fear for them. I've watched them try not to be demoralized when they have interactions with law enforcement or even just their friends. As things have changed in this climate, friendships are different.\"\n\nAsked if she's hopeful that the midterm elections can change things, she replies: \"Yes, because of that feeling I would get with every inauguration \u2014 that wow, we do have this peaceful exchange of power.\n\n\"So I am hopeful ...

Crude exports contribute one-third of Iran's government revenues.\n\n\"More than 20 importing nations have zeroed out their imports of crude oil already, taking more than one million barrels of crude per day off the market,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in a briefing. \"The regime to date since May has lost over $2.5 billion in oil revenue.\"\n\nPompeo said the waivers were issued to countries that have already cut purchases of Iranian crude over the past six months, and to \"ensure a well-supplied oil market.\" The exceptions are designed to last 180 days.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump claimed that his policy against Iran was working while campaigning in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Sunday. (Mark Humphrey/Associated Press)\n\nTrump said he wanted to go slow on the sanctions, citing concerns about causing global price spikes.\n\n\"I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the market. I don't want to lift oil prices,\" he told reporters before flying to a campaign event.\n\nIran's exports peaked at 2.8 million barrels per day in April, including 300,000 barrels per day of condensate, a lighter form of oil. Overall exports have since fallen to 1.8 million barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which expects volumes to drop to 1 million barrels per day.\n\nOil prices in October rallied above $85 per barrel on fears of a steep decline in Iranian exports. Prices have fallen since then on expectations that some buyers would receive exemptions and as supply from other big producers has increased.\n\nEllen Wald, an oil analyst and fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the impact on global oil prices should be \"blunted\" for the 180-day length of the waivers to the eight countries. The Trump administration hopes more oil production will come next year from Iraq and from a so-called neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, if a dispute between the two countries over the zone is resolved.\n\nIncreased output\n\nIn addition, U.S. oil output hit a record high this year of about 11.3 million barrels, and sustained high output could reduce the impact of sanctions. On Monday, international benchmark Brent crude oil futures erased earlier gains to trade at $72.85 a barrel while U.S. crude futures fell 0.4 per cent to $62.87.\n\nOil markets have been anticipating the sanctions for months and the world's biggest producers have been increasing output.\n\nJoint output from the world's top producers \u2014 Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia \u2014 in October rose above 33 million barrels per day for the first time, up 10 million barrels per day since 2010.\n\nU.S. officials have said the countries given temporary exemptions will deposit revenue in escrow accounts for Tehran to use solely for humanitarian purposes.\n\nThe sanctions also cover 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and vessels in its shipping sector, Tehran's national airline, Iran Air, and more than 65 of its aircraft, a U.S. Treasury statement said.\n\n\"We've said for a long time: Zero should mean zero,\" John Bolton, White House national security adviser told Fox Business Network in an interview. \"These are not permanent waivers \u2014 no way, we're going to do everything we can to squeeze Iran hard.\"", "Serge Ibaka outscored the Lakers by himself in the first quarter, and he didn't miss a shot until the third. He beat LA inside and outside on the way to the biggest offensive game of his career.\n\nThanks to Ibaka's brilliance for the Toronto Raptors, Kawhi Leonard wasn't missed by anyone except the Lakers fans who might have been hoping to entice him home.\n\nIbaka made his first 14 shots on the way to a career-high 34 points, and the Raptors didn't need an injured Leonard in a 121-107 victory over Los Angeles on Sunday night.\n\nIbaka had 10 rebounds and didn't miss a shot until 5:16 remained in the third quarter, finishing 15 of 17.

He's getting in there and taking his time. He's using his size, his power, and using pretty good footwork, so it's something we can go to.\"\n\nKyle Lowry added 21 points and 15 assists for the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors, who haven't lost to the Lakers since 2014.\n\n\"We really wanted to put some pressure on them and guard the ball,\" Nurse said. \"We got off to an unbelievable start. We looked athletic and fast all over the place tonight.\"\n\nToronto didn't let its huge lead dwindle significantly until the final minutes, when the Lakers' youngster got the margin down to 117-107 with LeBron James on the bench. Toronto was forced to re-insert its starters in the final minutes to preserve the win.\n\n\"They've been playing like they're the best team in the Eastern Conference so far,\" said James, who finished with 18 points and six assists. \"They just came out and hit us right in the mouth, and it's going to be very hard to make a game of that when you're trying to expend so much energy to get back into it.\"\n\nKyle Kuzma scored 24 points and Brandon Ingram added 16 for the Lakers, who are 4-6 after their first 10 games with James after this defeat on the tail end of a back-to-back set that began with a gritty win in Portland on Saturday night.\n\n\"In my experience, unfortunately, most of the time when a player like Kawhi sits out, that team ends up winning,\" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. \"There's a sense of freedom and joy that comes when a top player like that is out.

The Lakers would love to sign a second superstar like Leonard, who grew up in the Inland Empire area, one hour east of Los Angeles.\n\nBad start\n\nThe Lakers' first quarter was shockingly bad. Toronto took a 41-10 lead with 2:21 still remaining in the first quarter, and Ibaka outscored the Lakers 20-17 in the opening period.

On the Patriots next possession, Brady connected with Josh Gordon for a 55-yard TD.\n\nGordon caught five passes for 130 yards, the 12th 100-yard receiving game of his career.\n\nPatriots overcome injuries\n\nWith tight end Rob Gronkowski out with a back and ankle injury and leading rusher Sony Michel out for the second straight week with a knee issue, Brady and the Patriots had to get creative.\n\nThey again turned to receiver Cordarrelle Patterson to help carry the load in the backfield.\n\nPatterson was effective for the second straight week, rushing 11 times for 61 yards and a touchdown .\n\n\"So much of our team is guys being in roles that maybe they didn't sign up for,\" Brady said. \"But they're asked to do it. ... A lot of guys down and you're short at certain spots. Obviously, we have a lot of trust in him that when he's got the ball in his hands good things are gonna happen.\"\n\nHe worked in tandem with White to keep the Packers defence guessing. White took advantage and found space to turn short completions into first downs.\n\nNew England also capitalized on a pair of long flea-flicker passes to set up scores.\n\nRodgers was on target in the first half. He was elusive in the pocket and extended plays with his feet, keeping the Patriots' secondary off balance long enough to create space downfield or some big gains.\n\nThe longest was a 51-yard pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in the third quarter that helped set up Rodgers' 15-yard TD pass to Jimmy Graham that tied the game at 17. But the pocket got smaller in the second half as the Patriots defense sped him up, hitting him six times and sacking him once.\n\nBrady completed 16 of his first 22 passes but had six straight incompletions in the third quarter.\n\nCostly turnover\n\nThere wasn't a turnover in the game until Green Bay's Jones was stripped by Lawrence Guy early in the fourth quarter. The fumble was recovered by Stephon Gilmore on the Patriots' 24.\n\nNew England quickly capitalized, using four straight completions by Brady and a 37-yard pass from Julian Edelman to get to the Packers' 2. White scored from a yard out two plays later to put the Patriots back in front 24-17.\n\n\"It was obviously a big play in the game,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \"That was a turning point.\"\n\nThe Patriots' defence tightened on Green Bay's next drive. It culminated on third down when Adrian Clayborn and Trey Flowers dropped Rodgers for a 9-yard sack and forcing a punt.\n\nIt proved costly.\n\nOn just the third play of the ensuing drive Brady found Gordon over the middle. Packers cornerback Tramon Williams had a shot at a tackle, but whiffed, springing Gordon for his 55-yard touchdown.", "The Canadian Finals Rodeo wrapped up its first year in Red Deer on Sunday, more accessible than ever for cowgirls and cowboys in central and southern Alberta.\n\nUntil now, Edmonton's Northlands Coliseum had been home to the rodeo season finale for its entire 44-year history.

It suggests that privatization will delay care, as the switch limits the type of planes permitted by Transport Canada to operate for business, further limiting the type of runways they can land on.\n\nTwo-tiered system alleged\n\n\"We object to this change, as every community in our province that exists at the end of a gravel runway will suffer transport delays and delayed arrival of critical care services,\" states the letter.\n\nThe letter also suggests that those delays and reduction of service to northern Indigenous communities \"will be viewed as discriminatory,\" and suggests an absence of \"medical consultation.\"\n\nThe fourth criticism alleges privatization will create a two-tiered system in which southern residents have an advantage over those in the North and will receive faster service in the event of a medical emergency.\n\n\"We are working to maintain a vital health service that achieves good value for Manitobans, an effort the previous government failed to ever mount,\" Friesen responded, in a statement to CBC.\n\n\"Our government is interested in hearing from these physicians and look forward to reassuring them that we would never take a step that compromises the level of service Lifeflight offers in any way.\"\n\nDr. Marcus Blouw, one of the 16 signatories, declined comment on the letter until after the meeting with Friesen.\n\n'Vital public service'\n\n\"These doctors and their years of medical experience should be taken seriously, and the rush to privatize this vital public service should be put on ice,\" wrote Michelle Gawronsky, president of the Manitoba Government and General Employees' Union, in a statement.\n\n\"This letter reinforces what we have been saying for months now, based on the comprehensive research and expert analysis in the Breakwater Report \u2014 that this rush to privatize emergency air ambulance service is short-sighted and risky. The government should put patients first, and focus on improving this critical public service.\"\n\nThe leader of the NDP said Lifeflight responds to everything from a person's heart attack in a remote community, to support for someone in Dauphin who might need a ventilator en route to hospital, to the transport of pediatric cardiac patients to Edmonton.\n\n\"There may be times when it's not profitable to run an air ambulance,\" Wab Kinew told CBC News.\n\n\"If the government wants to save money, they shouldn't be looking to save a dollar on the most high priority trips in which these Lifeflight planes are used to keep people, and in some cases kids, alive while they get life-saving treatment.\"", "Almost 30 years ago, George Graves signed up for a Mastercard at his local Canadian Tire store.

That underwriting doesn't exist with credit card insurance.\"\n\nTaylor says people get better protection if they pay for life and disability insurance.\n\n\"Get the underwriting,\" she says, \"so you know if your illness will be covered or not.\"\n\nShe also recommends people create their own emergency fund.\n\n\"That way, if you get sick or injured, you can cover your minimum monthly payments yourself,\" says Taylor.\n\n'People don't understand how it works'\n\n\"A credit card is a high interest product, initially meant for safety and convenience,\" says Scott Hannah, president of the Credit Counselling Society. \"They're not designed to carry a long-term balance, that's the problem.\"\n\nScott Hannah of the Credit Counselling Society says people with crippling credit card debt often cut up their cards when they come in for debt counselling.

Sleep in my own bed, watch my TV show ... get up and just do your routine,\" he said Sunday.\n\nNo more mass evacuations please\n\nPardy said the experience has been difficult for community members, many of whom believe the threat of the landslide was overstated and didn't justify their being forced from their homes.\n\n\"Tomorrow we're going to start asking the question 'why?' We're going to ask the question, what if something takes the road out again? What is going to be the plan? Because the plan can't be a mass evacuation again.\"\n\nPardy says the slide destroyed one home in the community.\n\nChildren play at a landslide near Old Fort, B.C. which began outside the community on Sept. 30, 2018.
