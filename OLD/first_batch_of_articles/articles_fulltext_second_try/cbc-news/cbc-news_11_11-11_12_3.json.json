["Dwane Casey woke up Monday morning thinking about the Toronto Raptors.\n\nBut the Detroit Pistons coach said if there was any trepidation about Wednesday's return to Toronto, it was more about facing the league's hottest team and less about being back in the place from which he'd been unceremoniously punted six months ago.\n\n\"It will be different being on that side of the bench but I would be disingenuous to say it's not going to feel funny,\" Casey said in a phone interview. \"But the reason I say I woke up this morning is because we stubbed our toe against Charlotte, and I thought about who we have next and it has to be the Toronto Raptors, and I thought 'Oh my goodness, they're a good team.'\n\n\"Any human being worth his salt will say it'll be a different feeling, a funny feeling, but I think once the game starts and they throw it up, it will be one of 82 and I'm sure it's going to be the same for the players from the other side too.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old coach led the Raptors to a franchise-best 59-win season, but paid the price for their second-round dispatch by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the playoffs. A month after his firing, he won the Red Auerbach Trophy as the NBA's coach of the year, and signed a five-year deal with Detroit worth about $7 million US per season.\n\nCasey said he hasn't spoken to any Raptors since the season began \u2014 both because he has his own team to worry about, and out of respect for Toronto's season. But he's watched from afar, and feels proud of the growth he's seen in the players.\n\nDuring Monday's call, it was announced that Pascal Siakam was the Eastern Conference player of the week.\n\n\"I knew from the first day he worked out for us in Buffalo. He couldn't throw rice in the ocean out of a rowboat at that time,\" Casey said in his classic southern, homespun vernacular. \"But now to see him making shots and playing. The kid has an NBA motor, and I knew that, and his heart and spirit are in the right place. The sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nMuch has been made of the success Casey's successor Nick Nurse has had splitting up centres Jonas Valanciunas and Serge Ibaka, having one of them come off the bench. It was noted Casey used a similar rotation against Cleveland in the playoffs.\n\nCasey remains proud of players\n\n\"I thought that was something that would help open up the floor as far as the offence was concerned. And defensively . . . and so that was something we did last year and they've taken it this year, and used it to their advantage, so it's an effective weapon,\" Casey said.\n\n\"And Jonas has gotten better and improved each and every year. To watch him grow has been beautiful to see, just his maturity and his growth in the league, and everything's easier for him now, and he's letting the game come to him. So he's doing a good job there, and we've just got to figure out a way to slow both of those guys down on Wednesday night.\"\n\nRaptors guard Kyle Lowry told ESPN's \"The Undefeated\" last week that Casey's return will be strange. He had kind words for his former coach.\n\n\"It was an up-and-down one,\" Lowry said on their partnership. \"But he was like the nicest man in the world. I learned to respect what he did, how he came up and his approach to everything. He landed right back on his feet. So I'm happy for him.\"\n\nCasey and Lowry texted during the summer, and the coach has enjoyed watching Lowry play some of the best basketball of his career through 13 games.\n\n\"I'm proud of him also, the growth that he's had, and the all-pro season he's having so far,\" Casey said. \"Kyle made me a better coach, as far as learning to give and give in and listen and see different ways to skin a cat. I think vice-versa too. He's been a great leader for that organization and he's done a great job in his time there, and a lot of us owe him a lot for what he's done for that program.\"\n\nStaying in the game\n\nCasey had considered taking a year off from coaching, but said a phone call from Pistons owner Tom Gores spoke to the lifetime coach in him.\n\n\"He convinced me to get back in, I needed to be in, that I was a coach at heart, and when he made that pitch to me, the fact of how important, how I would miss coaching and that I needed to be in coaching, the game, that type of thing, I'd be empty without it, he's right,\" Casey said. \"I don't know what else I would do, just sitting out and not coaching basketball.\"\n\nCasey leads a 6-6- Pistons team that has missed the playoffs eight of the past nine seasons, and sees similarities in the Raptors squad he took over in 2011. He's enjoying working with Detroit's staff, including Ed Stefanski and Malik Rose, who he called an up-and-coming front office \"star.\"\n\nHis wife and two kids have settled into the \"beautiful\" Birmingham/Bloomfield Hills area of Detroit. The city is a big-time sports market that includes an \"entire mix of everything, basketball, football, baseball, hockey, college sports.\"\n\nHe had dinner with University of Michigan's athletic director Warde Manuel, and the Pistons held training camp there with the help of coach John Beilein. Spartans coach Tom Izzo was there when Detroit played an exhibition game at Michigan State.\n\n\"I knew them all in my college coaching life so it's different to step back and visit with them now. It's fun to be around, fun to see their teams practice and play and have them watch our teams practice,\" Casey said. \"It's an excellent market.\n\nClippers owner Steve Ballmer, who grew up in Detroit, recommended the school that Casey's two kids attend.\n\n\"Then Isiah Thomas tells me too,\" Casey said.\n\n\"I love that the former players are still around and involved. Rick Mahorn is with us, around us every day on the broadcast. Those guys still support the team. That's a big boost for us. Hopefully once we go into free agency, their words and encouragement will be a big plus for us in the free agent market.\"\n\nThe Raptors don't travel to Detroit until March 3.", "When the old Ninth Avenue bridge is retired next year, its iconic Inglewood goose sign, which welcomes people to the neighbourhood from its perch above, will fly the coop as well.\n\nIt's a decision that's ruffling a few feathers in the community.\n\nL.J. Robertson, the planning chair for the Inglewood Community Association, told the Calgary Eyeopener on Monday the group was told the architect for the modern replacement bridge didn't want to incorporate the old goose in the new design.\n\n\"[The goose sign] has been part of the fabric of the Inglewood gateway for that part of the community for many, many years,\" Roberston said.\n\n\"It's just a really odd thing to think that an employee on a civic project would have that kind of sway and control.\"\n\nThe 109-year-old bridge will be replaced by a four-lane, arch-design span that is expected to cost $23 million.\n\n\"The new bridge arch has a more modern esthetic compared to the old truss, and the project team did not believe that attaching the sign to the new bridge would fit the context of this design,\" Evan Fer, senior structural engineer with the city, said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe city says the old goose sign isn't a good fit for the modern replacement bridge. This file photo shows an artist rendering of the new Ninth Avenue bridge. (City of Calgary)\n\nFer did say, however, the team is looking at options for incorporating the sign elsewhere in the vicinity, like in Statue Park.\n\nThe iconic goose doesn't adorn just the bridge sign. It's also in the community association's letterhead.\n\nRobertson said she fears the historic neighbourhood is losing part of its identity.\n\n\"We will have lost, when by the time this is all said and done, two very old bridges that were really part of the infrastructure for the community and they both had geese attached to them,\" she said.\n\n\"It's been something that's been attached and part of the history and our riparian location for many years.\"\n\nL.J. Robertson from the Inglewood Community Association tells us why iconic goose will not be part of the the Inglewood bridge when it's replaced next year. 8:03\n\nCoun. Gian-Carlo Carra said he is sympathetic and thinks there might need to be a conversation about how the existing sign could be incorporated in a new way.\n\n\"I'm not prepared to say we will slap the goose sign onto the new bridge come hell or high water,\" said Carra, who represents Ward 9.\n\nThe new bridge is expected to open in the fall of 2020 or in early 2021.\n\nWith files from the Calgary Eyeopener.", "A civil liberties group is calling out the federal government for a perceived double standard, questioning how it can appeal a ruling against solitary confinement while at the same time saying it is trying to end the controversial practice.\n\nIn the B.C. Court of Appeal in Vancouver on Tuesday, Ottawa will attempt to overturn a B.C. Supreme Court decision from January that found isolating inmates for an indefinite amount of time was unconstitutional.\n\nIt comes a month after Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale tabled legislation to end the use of solitary confinement in federal prisons.\n\n\"If you say that you're going to eliminate solitary confinement and the very same day you give instructions to your lawyers to preserve solitary confinement and fight against the ruling that found it unconstitutional \u2026 it makes absolutely no sense,\" said Josh Paterson, executive director the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, the respondent fighting to uphold the original ruling.\n\n\"When solitary confinement is indefinite, as it can be in federal prisons, some people are held for months, sometimes years in rooms that are no bigger than someone's small washroom, the court said that is unconstitutional,\" Paterson told The Early Edition host Stephen Quinn.\n\n\"There has to be a time limit and there has to be independent oversight over people who are being placed in these conditions.\"\n\nJosh Paterson, with the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, says the new legislation doesn't include a required cap on how long an inmate may be isolated for. (Don Marce)\n\n'A new coat of paint and a new name'\n\nAccording to Goodale's bill, a new system called Structured Intervention Units (SIU) would be implemented to house inmates that are a danger to others or are in danger themselves.\n\nWhile in the units, inmates would be permitted to leave their cells for four hours a day, as well as have access to mental health care and other programs.\n\nBut there is no cap on how long a prisoner can be kept in an SIU \u2014 a requirement of the B.C. Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"As it is now, guards make lots of arbitrary decisions in relation to prisoners. We don't have any reason to trust that in a new system, with a new coat of paint and a new name, that prisoners won't have these opportunities taken away from them arbitrarily and that's why there needs to be [independent] oversight,\" said Paterson.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says his tabled legislation on solitary confinement looks to address the needs of the most vulnerable in federal prisons. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nA statement from Goodale's office says the government is committed to addressing the needs of the most vulnerable in the federal corrections system.\n\n\"[The proposed bill] will eliminate segregation and establish a fundamentally different system focused on rehabilitative programming and treatment. This new approach will allow us to maintain separation when necessary to maintain safety, and at the same time allow programming and human contact.\"\n\nThe statement adds that the government is appealing the ruling in order to to seek judicial clarity on the issue.\n\nLaw discriminates against mentally ill: ruling\n\nThe B.C. Supreme Court ruling by Justice Peter Leask found that the law surrounding administrative segregation jeopardizes prisoner and staff safety and discriminates against mentally ill prisoners.\n\n\"I am satisfied the law \u2026 fails to respond to the actual capacities and needs of mentally ill inmates and instead imposes burdens in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating their disadvantage,\" Leask wrote.\n\nHe added that under the existing rules a warden becomes judge and jury in terms of deciding how long to keep an inmate isolated.\n\nThe appeal hearing is expected to last for two days.\n\nListen to the full interview below:\n\nThe Early Edition host Stephen Quinn speaks with Josh Paterson about his teams' efforts to defend the Supreme Court of B.C.'s ruling that indefinite solitary confinement is unconstitutional. 7:40\n\nWith files from Jason Proctor", "The opening matches at the ATP Finals led to a debate over whether conditions at the O2 Arena were trickier than in past years.\n\nNovak Djokovic ended it.\n\nThe Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion made an impressive start to his campaign for a sixth title by dismissing John Isner 6-4, 6-3 on Monday.\n\nNovak Djokovic defeated John Isner 6-4, 6-3 and Alexander Zverev downed Marin Cilic 7-6, 7-6 on Day 2 of the ATP Finals in London. 1:25\n\nRoger Federer, who lost on Sunday, and Alexander Zverev described conditions as challenging following their error-strewn opening matches at the season-ending tournament, but Djokovic dropped just six points on his serve and made six unforced errors.\n\n\"My results here have been pretty good in the last 10 years, so I can't complain too much,\" said Djokovic, who has won four titles at the London venue. \"It takes a little bit of time really to get yourself adjusted to the surface because the surface is a good surface.\"\n\nA day after a ceremony to mark ending the season as No. 1, Djokovic underlined his status by nullifying Isner's usually destructive serve.\n\nIsner, who at 33 became the season-ending tournament's oldest debutant since 1972, applied himself admirably but barely avoided being broken more than once in the first set, and was broken twice more in the second set.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" Isner said of the atmosphere. \"I wish I could have given them a bit more to cheer for.\"\n\nThe one break Djokovic converted in the first set, at 2-2, was a cross-court forehand return winner which stranded Isner.\n\nSoccer star in attendance\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was in attendance, with Djokovic perhaps spurred on even more by the Juventus forward's presence.\n\n\"It's great to have big football star, sports star like him, courtside watching tennis,\" Djokovic said.\n\nAt 3-3, 15-30 in the second set, Isner sent down a second serve at 203 km/h.

But supply hasn't stayed steady enough for some retailers to keep regular hours.\n\nThe week of Oct. 17, when marijuana became legal, one of the city's two retail stores scaled back its planned hours to ensure it wouldn't run out of strains. And now, some retailers have been forced to shut down temporarily while they wait for the next shipment to come in.\n\nSince then, more stores have opened, giving customers more options and locations to peruse. But the pickings are slim because of waning weed supplies across the province.\n\nRaj Birk, owner of Global Leaf in the city's northeast, said he closed up his store on Friday because he had only a few strains left to sell, and that didn't justify keeping his brick-and-mortar store open.\n\n\"It sucks that you have to turn people back, you know,\" he said. \"There's nothing left to order.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he's employed some staff to monitor stock online and check to see if there's more to order.

But it may not be in the interest of a middle power like Australia, for example, to have Canada join the club. After last year's tensions, it didn't appear Canada would be joining anytime soon, but it's likely to keep making its case in Singapore.\n\nCanada is classified as a \"dialogue partner\" at ASEAN, joining some of the discussions but not as a full member. It is a full member of the 21-country APEC club, which meets next weekend in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea \u2014 and Trudeau is heading there next.\n\nYou want to do more trade in these regions? You simply have to show up. - Carlo Dade , Canada West Foundation\n\nThe Trudeau government's trade diversification agenda requires not just clever trade negotiators, but a strategic diplomatic push. The more trade fights Americans pick, the greater the incentive for other countries to figure out better ways to work together.\n\n\"You want to do more trade in these regions? You simply have to show up,\" Dade said. \"It's about just getting to know the people around the table so when you have to pick up the phone to call them it's not: 'Justin who?'\"\n\n\"We're behind the Aussies, the Kiwis, even the Americans in terms of knowing the players and knowing the markets,\" he said.\n\nLast month, the Canadian government wrapped up a public consultation on the potential for comprehensive trade negotiations with the 10-country ASEAN bloc.\n\nStakeholders expressed enthusiasm for better terms of trade for the sorts of goods and services typically associated with Canada's ambitions in Asia: more natural resources and agri-food exports, and new customers for Canadian construction and green technology services.\n\nBut the ASEAN countries with the greatest potential for Canada \u2014 Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia \u2014 are already part of the CPTPP. While others, like the Philippines or Indonesia, offer large potential markets, they're also controversial regimes to partner up with at the moment.\n\nAnd then there's Myanmar, also known as Burma \u2014 a country that could be condemned by some of its trading partners at these summits for persecution aimed at its Rohingya minority. It hardly seems like a priority trading partner in today's political climate.\n\nASEAN free trade deal 'aspirational'\n\nIn Dade's view, a free trade agreement with ASEAN makes \"no sense.\" Its trade agreements are famously \"low ambition\" in negotiator jargon \u2014 meaning it's unlikely to agree to the kind of broad, comprehensive change Canada seeks, going beyond tariff reductions to include things like intellectual property rules and labour standards.\n\nUnlike a country like Australia that has the advantage of being geographically close, Canada's trade \"is more aspirational than it is real.\"\n\nDade believes the Philippines may join the CPTPP eventually, and that's a better way to improve access to a market like this than separate ASEAN negotiations. \u200b\n\nBut Yves Tiberghien, a University of British Columbia professor, thinks that if enough Canadian businesses support the idea of negotiations with ASEAN, it could be considered.\n\n\"You need, ideally, to go where there's high growth,\" he said. If Canada doesn't want to put all its Asian eggs in China's basket, it needs other partners in the region.\n\nTrudeau was asked about Canada's plans for free trade talks with the ASEAN in Paris Monday.

(CBC News)\n\nThe countries currently negotiating the China-centred Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) are expected to hold talks in and around these summits.\n\nThat poses a challenge for Canada, which isn't interested in a \"low ambition\" deal that simply makes goods cheaper \u2014 and that's what's on offer at the RCEP table.\n\nInternational Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr will join Trudeau in Singapore after spending his weekend in talks with the Chinese, as Canada continues to explore its alternatives with the world's second-largest economy.\n\nTrudeau will meet with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at a Canada-China dialogue on Wednesday. Officials portray the leaders meeting as a chance to nail down agreement on some of the incremental progress Canada feels it's been making on specific market access issues.\n\nWhat form Canada's future trade co-operation with China might take appears more unclear than ever. While some in Canada suggest sector-specific talks could advance things farther and faster, the government is still pursuing a broad overall strategy, officials insist.\n\nNo confirmed meetings with Japan\n\nComprehensive talks with China in today's testy climate with the U.S., however, may be a non-starter, particularly given the language in the revised NAFTA agreement that suggests any final deal with the Chinese would need Uncle Sam's approval.\n\nMeanwhile, China recently mused about joining the CPTPP one day \u2014 something that would surely be easier for Canada than navigating its own set of negotiations.\n\n\"The U.S.-China confrontation is a big theme in the background. And on that issue, Canada is trying to hedge,\" Tiberghien said. \"The Canadian agenda is to kind of not be drawn into the war between China and the U.S.\"\n\nAmid all this, Canada needs to keep warming up its relations with Japan, a previously elusive free trade partner it's now working closely with, not only under the guise of the CPTPP but on efforts to reform the World Trade Organization as well.\n\nCanada was supposed to reach some kind of a side agreement with Japan after the conclusion of the North American trade talks to sort out discrepancies in the way the two deals interact for the automotive sector. Nothing has been released yet, leaving the industry wondering how the two deals are meant to co-exist, assuming NAFTA 2.0 is successfully ratified over the next year.\n\nCanadian officials have yet to confirm whether Trudeau will have one-on-one time with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at these summits.\n\nNevertheless, this year's summits are \"simpler, in a sense\" for Canada, Tiberghien said. With the CPTPP done, it's a \"happy year\" for many of the countries Trudeau will meet with: a chance to take a victory lap.\n\nThere may not be anything tangible yet, he said, but this is all about relationship building.\n\n\"This is Canada being present in one of the fastest booming places in the world,\" Tiberghien said.", "Video\n\nCBC Nova Scotia News November 12, 2018\n\nThe only daily TV news package to focus on Nova Scotians and their stories", "A farmer in the Drayton Valley area worries that his 26-year-old buckskin saddle horse fell victim to a \"trigger-happy\" hunter who mistook it for a deer.\n\nKevin Seely found his horse Rocky dead on his property on Nov. 4.\n\nThat day he checked on his dozen horses on his property, which he uses for winter pasture, near Range Road 83 and Township Road 480A, southwest of Drayton Valley, Alta.\n\nWhen he noticed his horses being led by another and not Rocky, he assumed the worst.\n\n\"I just looked around and saw all the ravens and crows in the trees from the yard site,\" Seely said. \"I went down there and found my horse.\"\n\nIt was dead from a bullet wound, about 300 yards away from where Seely's son lives.\n\nSeely suspects a hunter mistook his tan horse for a deer.\n\n\"I just think it's some trigger-happy hunter that doesn't know what he's shooting at until it's too late,\" he said.\n\nHe reported the incident to the RCMP, but doesn't expect the person responsible to be found.\n\nRCMP confirm they are investigating.\n\nSeely's wife rode Rocky on trail rides in the mountains.\n\nThe horse was gentle and reliable, which made him a good fit for children or inexperienced riders, Seely said.\n\nRocky was born before Seely's children, who are now in their late teens and early 20s.\n\nThe death has been upsetting for the family, he said.\n\n\"You hear about it all the time, people's horses getting shot,\" Seely said. \"It just never happened to me before.\"\n\nHe hopes whoever is responsible regrets the killing and learns to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n@Travismcewancbc\n\nTravis.mcewan@cbc.ca", "RCMP in southern Alberta are looking for information about a serious crash Monday morning involving two pickup trucks \u2014 one stolen \u2014 that sent five people to hospital.\n\nCoaldale RCMP say a couple from Yukon were heading south on Highway 4 when their vehicle slammed into the driver's side of a black Chevrolet truck that entered the road from Highway 845 in an unsafe manner.

Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox every weekday.\n\nHere's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:\n\nMeet the newest Hockey Hall of Famers\n\nFive men and one woman will be enshrined at tonight's induction ceremony in Toronto. Here's a little about each of them:\n\nGary Bettman: It's hard to think of a hall of famer more loathed by hockey fans. That'll happen when you preside over three lockouts (including one that wiped out a full season). But Bettman always made money for his partners. In his 25 years \u2014 and counting \u2014 as the NHL's commissioner, the league has grown from 24 teams to 31 and increased its revenues from $400 million US a year to more than $4 billion. That's a lot more cash in the pockets of owners and players.\n\nMartin Brodeur: One of the greatest goalies ever, Brodeur is the all-time leader in wins and shutouts. He won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie four times and anchored his stifling New Jersey teams to three Cups. That little trapezoid you see behind the net today? NHL rulemakers put it there partly because they were tired of Brodeur controlling the game with his puck-handling skills away from the goal.\n\nJayna Hefford: A key member of the Canadian women's hockey teams that won four straight Olympic gold medals between 2002 and 2014, Hefford scored the decisive goal in Canada's 3-2 win over the rival U.S. in the '02 final in Salt Lake City. She also helped Canada win seven world titles.\n\nWillie O'Ree: Hockey's closest thing to Jackie Robinson, O'Ree became the NHL's first black player when he suited up for Boston in January 1958 \u2014 11 years after Robinson broke baseball's colour barrier. O'Ree was no Jackie in terms of skill \u2014 he'd go on to play only 45 NHL games and score four goals. But he enjoyed a long pro career, logging more than 1,000 games in the minors.\n\nMartin St. Louis: One of hockey's great feel-good stories, the undersized forward worked his way up from undrafted free agent to two-time scoring champ and NHL MVP in 2004. He also won the Cup that year with Tampa Bay. St. Louis was short (nobody bought his listed height of 5-foot-8) but he carried a big stick (literally) and his tree-stump legs are legendary. Seriously, check 'em out in the photo below.\n\nAlexander Yakushev: \"Big Yak\" was just that \u2014 an immovable beast in front of the net for the Soviet team that nearly toppled Canada in the famed 1972 Summit Series. Yakushev might have gone down as the hero of that event \u2014 he led the Soviets with seven goals, including a pair in the deciding Game 8 \u2014 if Paul Henderson hadn't stolen the show. Henderson, famously, is still not in the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe's got legs. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\nQuickly...\n\nThe NHL settled a big concussion lawsuit. It was by far the biggest one facing the league, with a group of more than 100 former players accusing the NHL of not doing a good enough job of preventing, or warning them about, head trauma. The settlement is worth $18.9 million US \u2014 including a $22,000 cash payment for each player. The NHL will also cover the cost of neurological testing and up to $75,000 in medical treatment for those that qualify, and a fund will be set up to support retired players. Under the deal, though, the league doesn't acknowledge any liability for any of the players' claims. That was also a key element of the billion-dollar settlement the NFL reached for a similar lawsuit a few years ago.\n\nR.J. Barrett and the Blue Devils are No. 1. Duke moved into top spot in the men's college basketball rankings today after starting the season with two impressive wins. The Canadian Barrett set a school record for a freshman debut with 33 points against Kentucky last week, and followed with 23 in a rout of Army. Barrett and fellow freshman Zion Williamson could be the top two picks in the next NBA draft.\n\nIt's crunch time for Calgary's Olympic bid. Tomorrow, Calgarians will vote in a plebiscite asking whether or not they're in favour of their city continuing to pursue the 2026 Winter Olympics. The result is non-binding, but the city council will almost certainly follow the will of the people. We'll have a primer on the referendum, and what it means, in tomorrow's edition of The Buzzer.\n\nFreshmen Zion Williamson, left, and Canada's R.J. Barrett have pushed Duke to the top ranking in college basketball. (Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)\n\nWeekend Winners and Losers\n\nWinner: Jeremiah Masoli\n\nIf you're one of those people who thinks the weekend starts on Thursday night (I am one of those people) then no one had a better weekend than the Hamilton quarterback. On Thursday Masoli was named a finalist for the CFL's Most Outstanding Player award, and on Sunday he threw three first-half touchdown passes as the Ticats destroyed B.C. 48-8 in their playoff game. Hamilton travels to Ottawa next week for the East Division final.\n\nLoser: The CFL's player-safety efforts\n\nOfficials missed a devastating high hit that knocked Saskatchewan QB Brandon Bridge out of the game late in Sunday's playoff loss to Winnipeg. No penalty was called, and a replay showed that the ref's view was blocked. Riders fans were enraged \u2014 especially since Bridge was only in there because No. 1 QB Zach Collaros had been sidelined by another high hit in their regular-season finale.\n\nThe Bridge hit probably didn't impact the outcome of the game \u2014 the Riders still had a long way to go in not much time and needed a TD. But it was another blow to a league that has tried to put more emphasis on player safety. CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said he'll consider allowing video replay officials to flag such plays next year. Winnipeg will now face top-ranked Calgary in the West final, by the way.\n\nWinner: Alyson Charles\n\nNot bad for a rookie. The 20-year-old Canadian short track speed skater continued her stellar start by winning her first World Cup gold medal. Charles' victory in the 1,000-metre race in Salt Lake City came a week after she collected three bronze medals in her first World Cup meet.\n\nWinner: Jimmy Butler\n\nThe disgruntled NBA all-star finally got his wish when Minnesota traded him to Philadelphia on Saturday. Butler goes from a dysfunctional team (to be fair, he caused some of that dysfunction) to one that already had two legit stars in Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. The Sixers' new Big Three could threaten Toronto's status as the frontrunners to win the East and earn the privilege of losing to Golden State in the Finals.\n\n.\n\nLoser: NFL gamblers\n\nLast week was a disaster for the bookies, who got cleaned out when a bunch of popular NFL teams won by big margins. They got their revenge Sunday as big \"public\" sides in Kansas City, New England, Atlanta and Philly failed to cover the spread \u2014 and even lost outright, in the case of the last three.\n\nYou're up to speed.

Drop us a line at thebuzzer@cbc.ca.", "St. Thomas University professor Tony Tremblay is studying \"the notion of backwardness\" and perceptions about New Brunswickers.\n\nThe scholar of English literature is looking to a different kind of narrative to study negative stereotypes about New Brunswick, and how to change them.\n\nTremblay is collecting stories told by politicians, media, and the public to learn why New Brunswick is associated with what he calls \"the notion of backwardness.\"\n\nFor his research, Tremblay defines backwardness in economic terms. \u200bTremblay doesn't believe New Brunswick is backwards, but he said identity is created more by the stories told about a community or place than the inherent qualities of the people or place itself.\n\nHe said the dominant narrative seems to be about New Brunswick's economic status.\n\n\"The stories that circulate around that are stories of New Brunswick laziness or New Brunswickers' unwillingness to get off wealth transfers from other richer parts of Canada. There's stories about lack of mobility among New Brunswickers, New Brunswickers not desiring to move from one location to another to take a job in a community 50 kilometres away,\" he said.\n\nTremblay says the stories told about Prince Edward Island, like 'Anne of Green Gables,' paint a more romantic and pastoral picture than those told about New Brunswick. (Steve Bruce/CBC)\n\nThe statistics released about New Brunswick's standing compared to the rest of the country don't help.\n\n\"We have the lowest mean family income. We have the highest rate of [youth] STDs. We have among the highest rates of obesity and illiteracy in the country. Based on the last census, we were the only province in the country with a still diminishing population,\" Tremblay said.\n\n\"It seems like a no-brainer to come up with the conclusion that we are a backward, illiterate, slow-to-modernize province.\"\n\nHowever, Tremblay said these conclusions usually don't consider pre-existing structural conditions in the province.\n\n\"A set of social statistics does not equate to the nature of a population.\"\n\nBetter knowledge of N.B. history needed\n\nTremblay believes better self-knowledge and access to New Brunswick's history could help challenge negative narratives.\n\nHe said 96 per cent of his students don't know enough about their province's history or literary contributions.\n\nYoung people going to school in New Brunswick are learning about writers from other places, but they're not learning about New Brunswick, he said.\n\n\"What they are learning about and are hearing are the stories about our backwardness, not the stories of our success.\"\n\nTremblay compares the stories told about New Brunswick to those of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.\n\nHe said those narratives tend to be romantic \u2014 stories of Scottish heritage and folk culture, or pastoral escapes from urban life.\n\nThe most well-known narrative of that sort is arguably P.E.I.'s Anne of Green Gables.\n\n\"The stories told about New Brunswick have a harder edge,\" Tremblay said.\n\n\"They're darker stories. They are stories about deficit, stories about intransigence, stories about an unwillingness to change, a kind of reckless unwillingness to change.\"\n\nTremblay is still in the early stages of his research, but he's hoping studying the negative stories and stereotypes surrounding New Brunswick may reveal the best way to change them.", "Los Angeles Kings goalie Jack Campbell will be out for at least a month after surgery to repair a meniscus tear in his knee.\n\nThe Kings recalled goalie Cal Petersen from their American Hockey League affiliate in Ontario on Monday.\n\nLos Angeles is without its top two goalies after Campbell's injury followed Jonathan Quick's surgery last month to repair a meniscus tear in his own knee. Peter Budaj is the Kings' likely starter until Quick returns.\n\nCampbell will be out for four to six weeks after getting hurt in a 1-0 loss to Calgary last Saturday.\n\nThe 26-year-old former first-round draft pick has played well in his first extensive NHL experience this season, going 5-7-0 with a 2.33 goals-against average and .923 save percentage.\n\nStandout rookie season\n\nPetersen, 24, has played 10 games in his second season with the Reign and has a 2-3-1 record, 4.29 GAA and .881 save percentage.\n\nIn his first pro season a year ago, the former Notre Dame netminder posted 23 victories in 41 appearances and among AHL rookies ranked first in wins, fourth in GAA and fifth in save percentage.\n\nQuick has appeared in just four games this season for the Kings, going 0-3-1 with a 4.55 GAA. He missed five games with a lower body injury after playing in Los Angeles' season opener, but has allowed 14 goals in three games since returning.\n\n1-2-0 under interim coach Desjardins\n\nQuick is the winningest goalie in Kings history, a two-time Stanley Cup champion and the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the NHL post-season MVP in 2012.\n\nThe former U.S. Olympian won the Jennings Trophy for the second time last season as the goalie for the NHL team with the fewest goals allowed.\n\nThe disappointing Kings are in last place in the Western Conference at 5-10-1 and have dropped two of three games under interim head coach Willie Desjardins, who took over from the fired John Stevens on Nov. 4.\n\nLos Angeles hosts the 11-6-0 Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday at 10:30 p.m. ET.", "Alberta's Lubicon Cree have been fighting for decades for a land they could call their own.\n\nBut the day before he's poised to sign the historic claim with Premier Rachel Notley, Chief Billy-Joe Laboucan says the real work is just beginning.\n\nHe says the First Nation has to buckle down and start using some of the deal's resources to build much-needed houses and a school.\n\nThe deal, reached in late October, offers $113 million from the provincial and federal governments as well as 246 square kilometres of land near the community of Little Buffalo.\n\nLaboucan says the land has seen little industrial disturbance, which he attributes to the band's long fight for recognition under previous chief Bernard Ominayak.\n\nThe Lubicon Lake Band has sought a treaty since 1899, when it was not included in Treaty 8.\n\nOminayak is not expected at the signing, although he has been invited.\n\nThe Lubicon Lake Nation is about 450 kilometres north of Edmonton.", "Quebec's youth protection services failed to provide adequate followup with a teen in foster care who had expressed suicidal thoughts, a coroner has concluded.\n\nCoroner \u00c9\u200bric L\u00e9pine\u200b said what happened to 14-year-old Rhoda Tunu Parr could be symptomatic of a larger problem across Quebec's Inuit territory of Nunavik.\n\nParr died by suicide in the summer of 2017.\n\nIn his report, L\u00e9pine recommends that Quebec's Commission on Human and Youth Rights evaluate how authorities handled Rhoda Tunu's file.\n\n\"We can call this a failure, at least in terms of how her intervention plan was handled,\" L\u00e9pine said in an interview with CBC News.\n\nCourt order ignored\n\nRhoda Tunu, described as smart but introverted by her case workers, lived a tumultuous last few years.\n\nHer mother moved from Nunavik to Montreal in 2016 and maintained little contact with her daughter.\n\nRhoda was bounced from foster home to foster home in Salluit, Quebec's second-northernmost community, from the time she was placed in care until her death, two years later.\n\nShe was often absent from school, particularly in 2016 and 2017. She'd told authorities that she was bullied there.\n\nA court ordered that the girl undergo a psychological assessment in 2015, when youth protection first got involved with her care, but it never happened.\n\n\"It wasn't a question of choice, it was an order. The order wasn't respected,\" L\u00e9pine said.\n\nL\u00e9pine said a psychological evaluation might have helped authorities better evaluate the girl's needs, although there is no way to know whether an intervention would have prevented her death.\n\nIn his report, L\u00e9pine also said youth protection workers failed to follow up with Rhoda in the three weeks preceding her death, even though they had been notified by her foster family about suicidal remarks she'd made in December 2016.\n\n\"A closer watch would have been justified,\" L\u00e9pine wrote.\n\nIn addition, according to a police report, a notebook was found after Rhoda's death, foreshadowing the teen's suicidal intentions.\n\nInadequate help in Nunavik\n\nL\u00e9pine wrote that social services \"remain clearly insufficient\" in Salluit and other Inuit communities throughout Nunavik.\n\nIn an interview with CBC News, he said his report focused on Rhoda Tunu's death, but in the course of the investigation, he determined that the the regional health authority responsible for youth protection in Nunavik has a lot of difficulty recruiting and retaining staff.\n\nThe regional health authority that oversees youth protection in Nunavik calls Rhoda Tunu's case a \"deeply regrettable situation,\" adding that the case is currently under investigation and that it will co-operate with the investigation.\n\nAt least 15 Inuit young people, including one still in elementary school, have taken their own lives over the past few months in Nunavik.\n\nTwo weeks ago, community leaders held emergency meetings in Nunavik's administrative centre of Kuujjuaq to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis.", "With some pumpkins, a sharpie and a slegehammer, three University of New Brunswick Fredericton students were out to smash the stigma of mental health.\n\nThey represent the local chapter of Jack.org, a mental health advocacy group.\n\nThe idea is to write words related to mental health stigma on the pumpkins and smash them.\n\nStudents were asked to write a word on the pumpkin about mental health that carries a stigma and then smash it with a sledgehammer.

The girl spins, twirls and waves her arms. Both hold out their hands to catch falling snowflakes. Then they jump up and down. The look on their faces is pure joy.\n\nRebecca Davies, spokesperson for the Ripple Refugee Project, a Toronto-based group of private citizens that sponsors, settles, and helps to integrate newcomers to Canada, posted the video on Twitter, Reddit and YouTube. It has been viewed on Twitter more than 1.85 million times.\n\nThe family arrived on Thursday from a refugee camp in Sudan, where they had lived for the past five years after fleeing violence in Eritrea. The video was taken on Saturday. The family, which includes a mother and four children, aged 7, 5, 3 and 13 months, is living with Davies.\n\n\"I looked up and there were big, fat snowflakes,\" Davies said on Monday. \"We had talked the day before about weather in Canada.

U2, Lou Reed and Blondie also performed \"under the neon palms.\"\n\nBut it was never a big money-maker. The club changed hands several times and it went through a number of makeovers through the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nWekerle, a tech entrepreneur and TV personality, bought the venue for $3.78 million in 2015 just as it was supposed to close for good.\n\nThe original plan to restore the sign was scrapped after an inspection revealed decades of damage to the marquee, so Wekerle says he went with the next best thing.\n\n\"[Pride Signs] painstakingly took every dimension. You look at the wear and tear of the previous sign, they've tried to replicate that,\" Wekerle explained, adding that it wasn't feasible to install programmable lights or energy efficient bulbs in the original version.\n\nWhile the old palm will no longer welcome visitors at the front door, concert-goers will be able to catch a glimpse of the original sign inside the venue, where it has been split in half to bookend the stage.\n\nThe original sign, first installed in 1948.\n\n'El Mo' set to open in 2019\n\nThe El Mocambo was closed and put up for sale in 2014.

It is not a decision to try and reduce costs. It's all about getting U.S. content,\" Soubry told CBC News.\n\nThe transfer of the work begins this month; the reduction in Winnipeg staff starts with notifications to staff in January 2019 and staggered through to August.\n\nNew Flyer president Paul Soubry says moving work to the U.S. 'is a tough one to swallow.'

So when we see three in the United States, it means probably a total of nine died.\"\n\nThis North Atlantic right whale was freed from fishing lines in the Bay of Fundy near Campobello Island in 2017. (International Fund for Animal Welfare)\n\nBut the decrease in population is also because for the first time in the 38 years these whales have been monitored, no new calves were born.\n\nThe report said that there were 71 breeding females in 2017, down from 105 in 2015. The report also said that entanglements with fishing gear have a big impact on the females \u2014 and within three years of a severe entanglement, only about 33 per cent of females survive.\n\n\"Those that are able to break free and survive the initial entanglement, they bear scars and wounds that seem to be impacting their ability to reproduce,\" Hamilton said. \"They either delay or cease reproduction depending on the severity of the wounds from their entanglements.\"\n\nBut another reason the whales aren't reproducing is because of climate change. As whales move further away in search of food, Kraus said the animals are using more energy than they're getting through food \u2014 and female whales need to have adequate reserves to carry a calf.\n\n\"In that context, if they take a few years off from having babies, it's not such a big deal. They can recover from that. But in a population like this though, for them to survive going through several years of not having many kids, we have to stop killing them. That's the simple answer,\" Kraus said.\n\n\"Anytime you get below 500 animals in a population, you\u2019re in deep trouble,\" said Scott Kraus. (Pat Foster/Adrian Colaprete)\n\nIn the last year, Canada implemented new measures to try to protect the right whale, after 12 right whales were reported dead in Canadian waters in 2017, along with another five in U.S. waters.\n\nThe report points out that while there haven't been any deaths in Canadian waters this year, there were still three reported entanglements. One of the U.S. entanglement deaths was caused by Canadian snow crab gear.\n\nBut the changes in Canadian waters, which included reducing vessel speeds and temporary fisheries closures when a right whale was spotted, are something both Hamilton and Kraus said were effective.\n\n\"That's moving in the right direction. The question is whether or not that is sustainable,\" Hamilton said.\n\nHamilton said increasing the size of protected areas and trying to remove fishing lines from the water column are some of the big next steps to keeping the species alive.\n\n\"The silver lining that I see in the current trajectory is that people will actually realize that we cannot sustain this. It's going to take really big changes in how we fish and how we ship,\" Hamilton said.\n\n\"And that's possible. So hopefully the direness of the situation will be the one thing that saves them.\"\n\nIn 2017, 12 right whales were confirmed dead in Canadian waters. (Shane Fowler/CBC)\n\nKraus, too, said the whales can recover from very low numbers\n\n\"I do feel optimistic about it largely because many of the shipping and fishing industry groups have really bought on to the idea that they need to change practices to figure out how to co-exist with right whales,\" he said.\n\n\"So it may take us a few years, but I have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to keep guys fishing, keep the shipping going and not kill whales at the same time.\"", "The Ontario government says the province's only outlet for legal recreational cannabis has eliminated its backlog on orders and is \"back on track\" when it comes to deliveries.\n\nFinance Minister Vic Fedeli says the online Ontario Cannabis Store is returning to its original delivery time of one to three days after grappling with delays since recreational cannabis became legal last month.\n\nThe government-run website, however, is still posting a notice that orders will be delivered in three to five business days, and says it could take longer due to rotating postal strikes.\n\nThe Ontario Cannabis Store launched Oct. 17 and remains the only way for residents in the province to legally purchase recreational cannabis until brick-and-mortar stores are put in place next year.\n\nOntario's ombudsman has said his office received more than 1,000 complaints about the online store since it opened, related to delivery delays, poor customer service and issues with billing.\n\nLast week, the Ontario Cannabis Store notified its customers of a privacy breach at Canada Post that compromised the personal information of 4,500 people who had placed online orders.", "By a quirk of fate, Ryerson student Emil Borggren fell in love with rugby league on a visit to his native Denmark.\n\nThe 23-year-old Borggren, who has a Canadian father and Danish mother, was born in Denmark but came to Canada with his family when he was six.\n\nBorggren played rugby union for the Toronto Nomads, Ontario Junior Blues and the University of Western Ontario but suffered some injury setbacks.

However, there are some 96,000 households currently lined up for social housing, according to the latest city numbers, while new subsidized housing is also difficult to come by.\n\nThe city has been slow to build new affordable housing in recent years, and has also been criticized for how it advertises the units it does finish.\n\nLast month, Mayor John Tory laid out a three-point plan to tackle Toronto's affordable housing crunch, after campaigning on the promise of building 40,000 new affordable housing units over the next 12 years.\n\nBut those housing units are years from being on the market, and Aaron says people are already scrambling to find shelter right now.\n\nConstruction is underway on a 24-hour temporary shelter in the parking lot of Lamport Stadium.

Saric averaged 13.5 points with the 76ers over parts of three seasons, while Covington averaged 12.9 points during his five seasons with Philly. They were the starting forwards for the 76ers in nearly every game last season, when Philadelphia had its best record since 2000-01 \u2014 the last time that the franchise went to the NBA Finals.\n\nThe deal between the teams was struck on Saturday, though it couldn't become official until Monday when the NBA had what's known as a trade call \u2014 where all the terms of the swap are reviewed to ensure the deal is permissible under league rules.\n\nIt ends a two-month saga during which there was no doubt that Butler was going to get traded out of Minnesota. He told the Timberwolves shortly before training camp that he wanted to be moved, which forced Minnesota's hand because it was obvious that Butler would not re-sign next summer. So the options were move him for something, or lose him for nothing.\n\n\"He loves to win,\" Fultz said. \"He's going to do whatever it takes to win.\"", "Stan Lee, who dreamed up Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk and a cavalcade of other Marvel Comics superheroes that became mythic figures in pop culture with soaring success at the movie box office, died at the age of 95, his daughter said Monday.\n\nAs a writer and editor, Lee was key to the ascension of Marvel into a comic book titan in the 1960s when, in collaboration with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he created superheroes who would thrill generations of young readers.\n\nLee's daughter C.J. Lee confirmed the death to Reuters. Lee is survived by his daughter and his younger brother, Larry Lieber, who also worked in comics.\n\nAmericans were familiar with superheroes before Lee, in part thanks to the 1938 launch of Superman by Detective Comics, the company that would become DC Comics, Marvel's archrival.\n\nLee was widely credited with adding a new layer of complexity and humanity to superheroes. His characters were not made of stone \u2014 even if they appeared to have been chiseled from granite. They had love and money worries and endured tragic flaws or feelings of insecurity.\n\n\"I felt it would be fun to learn a little about their private lives, about their personalities and show that they are human as well as super,\" Lee told NPR News in 2010.\n\nLee's creations included web-slinging teenager Spider-Man.

In 2002, he sued to claim his share, months after Spider-Man conquered movie theatres, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits. In a legal settlement three years later, he received a $10 million one-time payment.\n\nHollywood studios made superheroes the cornerstone of their strategy of producing fewer films and relying on big profits from blockbusters. Some people assumed that, as a result, Lee's wealth had soared. He disputed that.\n\nI don't have $200 million. I don't have $150 million.

At age 17, he became an errand boy at Timely Comics, the company that would evolve into Marvel. He got the job with help from an inside connection, his uncle, according to Lee's autobiography Excelsior!\n\nLee soon earned writing duties and promotions.

But his wife urged him to give it one more shot and create the complex characters he wanted to, even if it led to his firing.\n\nThe result was the Fantastic Four. There was stretchable Mr. Fantastic, his future wife Invisible Woman, her brother the Human Torch and strongman The Thing. They were like a devoted but dysfunctional family.\n\nSuperheroes had humanity\n\n\"Stan's characters were always superheroes that had a certain amount of humanity about them or a flaw,\" said Shirrel Rhoades, a former executive vice-president of Marvel and its publisher in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"As iconic as Superman may be, he's considered a boy scout. He doesn't have any real flaws,\" Rhoades said. \"Whereas you take a Spider-Man, kids identify with him because he had his problems like they did. He suffered from great angst.\"\n\nThank you Stan Lee for making people who feel different realize they are special. \u2014@Sethrogen\n\nLee involved his artists in the process of creating the story and even the characters themselves, in what would come to be known as the \"Marvel Method.\" It sometimes led critics to fault Lee for taking credit for ideas not entirely his own.\n\nHe described his creative process to Reuters in outlining how he came up with his character Thor, the god of thunder borrowed from Norse mythology.\n\n\"I was trying to think of something that would be totally different,\" he said. \"What could be bigger and even more powerful than the Hulk? And I figured why not a legendary god?\"\n\nTo give Thor more rhetorical punch, Lee gave him dialogue styled after the Bible and Shakespeare.\n\nAs for Tony Stark-Iron Man, he was based on industrialist Howard Hughes, Lee told interviewers.\n\nStan's Soapbox\n\nLee became Marvel's publisher in 1972. He went on the lecture circuit, moved to Los Angeles in 1980 and pursued opportunities for his characters in movies and television.\n\nThrough it all, he kept connected with fans, writing a column called Stan's Soapbox in which he often slipped in his catchphrase \"'Nuff Said\" or the signoff \"Excelsior!\" In his later years, he gave constant updates via Twitter.\n\n\"Stan was a character. He was a character as much as any he ever created,\" Rhoades said. \"He created himself, in a way.\"\n\nStan was a character.

Trade is not an event and we're having a continuous dialogue with our Chinese counterparts about a whole variety of products.\"\n\nLast week, Treasury Board President Scott Brison told the Globe and Mail the best way to move forward quickly with China on trade would be to focus on opportunities for immediate gains in areas such as food and agriculture.\n\nAnd indeed Canada has sector-by-sector targets, including an aim to double Canadian agricultural exports to China to $75 billion by 2025, Carr said. \"We're well on our way to meeting those goals,\" he said.\n\nBrison's comments echoed those put forward by dozens of business experts in a recent Public Policy Forum paper, warning that a sweeping deal risks provoking the United States.

Canadian companies taking part in the China International Import Expo last week secured $1.67 billion in agreements.\n\nChina's interest in so many Canadian products could ultimately lead to a comprehensive trade agreement, Carr said.\n\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau, who's also in China, said high-level economic and financial discussions this week between the two countries were productive, and those talks will continue regularly to keep the momentum going.\n\nBut he also noted that while Canada is actively promoting itself as \"open for business\" with China, when it comes to state-owned enterprises looking to invest in Canadian companies, Canada will be cautious.\n\n\"We will examine those investment to make sure there are no security or other challenges for the Canadian economy,\" Morneau said. \"It's consistent with the way other countries consider these investments.\"", "Gatineau police are urging residents to learn the city's rules around dangerous dogs after a four-year-old girl was bitten on the face last week.\n\nThe girl was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries after she was attacked by a pit bull on the evening of Nov. 8.\n\nShe had been playing with the dog at a home on rue Cinq-Mars, said Const.

It is desperately in need of new beds,\" she told reporters on Monday. \"Demand is high across the province but particularly high in this area.\"\n\nHorwath said Walter Mills, and thousands of seniors like him, are waiting for the \"safe, dignified care\" they need and deserve.\n\nWait times hard on caregivers, NDP says\n\nWait times take their toll, she added, because family members caring for loved ones with dementia often don't sleep through the night because their loved ones wander.\n\n\"They don't have a moment of peace during the day because their loved ones have such intense needs. And they struggle to see light at the end of the tunnel because there are still hundreds or even thousands of people in front of them on the waiting lists,\" she said in a news release.\n\nHorwath said the government needs to make long-term care beds a priority.\n\n\"What we want is a commitment from the government to build the beds,\" she said.\n\nNDP Leader Andrea Horwath says seniors need 'safe, dignified' care.

But we have promised 15,000, and we will deliver 15,000,\" she said.\n\n\"The fact is, because there are over 30,000 people waiting for long-term-care beds, we have to be innovative. We have to think outside the box. We have to make sure that we can find those beds for those people, because they deserve it. They deserve it, and the people of Ontario expect us to provide that, and we will.\"", "In a cluttered workshop in Wakefield, Que., Wanda Seguin sorts through old door knobs and hinges.\n\nSeguin is a contractor by trade \u2014 particularly handy with drywall and plumbing \u2014 who also spends time fixing up other people's junk to sell.\n\nNow she's teaching others the skills she's picked up over the years, first as a child figuring out how toys worked, then on the streets as she struggled with addiction, and finally, after completing treatment, during years of work as a contractor.\n\n\"Most of the skills I think came from a survival place.

It also restricted movement through crossings with Israel, preventing foreign journalists, local businessmen and some aid workers from leaving the territory.\n\nHamas also cancelled a weekly beach protest in northwestern Gaza along the border with Israel. The organizers cited \"the ongoing security situation.\"\n\nHamas said Israeli undercover forces entered the territory in a civilian vehicle late Sunday and exchanged fire with Hamas gunmen.

Most previous research has focused on volunteers with an elevated risk of heart attack, stroke and/or cancer.\n\nThe researchers gave 2,000 international units of vitamin D per day, 1 gram of marine omega-3 fatty acids, or placebo supplements to 25,871 volunteers aged 50 or older. None had a history of cancer, heart attack or stroke.

Their conversation has been edited for length.\n\nMarcy: What is your reaction to Mr. Graydon and what he's had to say?\n\nAngela Braun: Hearing his comments, and recognizing that I think the person who has made the allegations is really correct, he does not have an understanding of sexual harassment. Recognizing that he's also not likely made those types of comments to male colleagues in the workplace, it's definitely demeaning and objectifying women for sure.\n\nHow do you think this incident might be affecting people in rural Manitoba?\n\nLeadership sets the tone in any organization, in any business, and in this case, the tone was that that type of behaviour was OK. It gets to quite a slippery slope, because if leadership is behaving that way, it condones the behaviour or even more serious behaviour in other people in the work, and so I think it is quite a serious issue.\n\nWhere do you think that attitude may come from, in a wider way?\n\nThis was not a discussion we were having for many years. That's part of the issue as well. That behaviour has been going on for so long, [it's difficult] to try and switch gears and try to get people to recognize that they will be believed if they come forward \u2014 like empowering them to speak out.\n\nAnd I think that's one of the messages that will come out of this, is that if something like this happens to you, and it can happen in any type of environment \u2026 people will be empowered to speak out and know that action will be taken.\n\nGraydon now sits as an Independent MLA. (Ian Froese/CBC)\n\nHow do attitudes like Mr. Graydon's affect women who come to your shelter, for example?\n\nI think it really does perpetuate that whole victimization and recognizing that you can come forward.\n\nIt makes it so much more difficult when that behaviour is pervasive, that women are being demeaned and victimized over and over again, and it seems to be condoned in the workplace. In this case, it's been probably going on for many years, but I would expect that that's the case in a lot of places, because we have only just recently started openly talking about this.\n\nWhat do you suggest is a response going forward to a man that may say, 'I didn't mean it. I didn't get it'?\n\nI think there needs to be concrete examples. Most men have women in their lives and if you thought about somebody speaking to your spouse or your daughter that way in a workplace, it gives you an icky feeling, and so I think there needs to be some concrete feeling attached to not just the sensitivity training or policy in the business or organization, but some actual meat on that to know what that actually means, what that looks like.\n\nDo you think attitudes like Mr. Graydon's affect the policies and actions that we see coming from government?\n\nI do, and I think that the more diversity we can get in places of leadership, the better chances we'll have that these types of things come to light and make some positive changes so that these things won't won't continue to happen.\n\nThe embattled Emerson MLA ousted from the Progressive Conservative caucus, says he is no sexual harasser, although he made inappropriate comments toward female legislative staff members. 1:53\n\nWhat do you hear from women in your part of the province about understanding such things?\n\nWhat we hear is that young women are more likely to push this envelope forward because they're more involved and they're more engaged with social media and all of that MeToo movement. I would say that they would be quicker to identify something like this. Whether they would necessarily move ahead with it or feel empowered to speak to somebody at this point? That I don't know. But they certainly would be faster to identify it.\n\nWhy do we often see an implied forgiveness before an accountability is called for?\n\nAs we get younger people in leadership and we get more diversity and a greater understanding, I think we will see some changes, but I imagine that that's going to be a fairly slow process.\n\nAnd going forward, whether in this case or in general, there's a lot of risk, often, to the person that has been the target of this or a different type of abuse. The person that's been victimized often has to weigh that out and in a case like this, where there's sexual harassment and the person looks around and no one else is reacting, they might think if no one else is reacting maybe they're overreacting.\n\nDoes intent matter?\n\nI didn't intend to hurt you, but ultimately I still did hurt you \u2014 and there lies the accountability and the responsibility \u2014 not only to say I'm sorry in this case but that I'm sorry and I'll do better next time. I think that's the next step of this. Saying sorry is just a piece of it, acknowledging it is just a piece of it.

The project was entirely financed by private overseas investors during the Great Depression.\n\nThe bridge, with a total suspension span of 847 metres, emerges from Vancouver's Stanley Park to cross Burrard Inlet and land in West Vancouver. It acts as the gateway to the Coastal Mountains that include its namesake \u2014 the twin peaks of The Lions.\n\nThe Lions Gate Bridge, at left in an aerial photo, spans a narrow part of Burrard Inlet to link Vancouver and the North Shore.

I think just that visual makes it so Instagramable,\" Atkin said.\n\nIt took nearly two decades for the project, also known as the First Narrows Bridge, to come to fruition. Today, about 60,000 vehicles cross the bridge each day and many recognize it as one of the region's most beloved icons that continues to bedevil commuters.\n\nGot a little free time in Vancouver at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JAM18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JAM18</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ENTSOC18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ENTSOC18</a>, rent a bike and ride through the park and across Lions Gate bridge. <a href=\"https://t.co/s6ZFrmrzFX\">pic.twitter.com/s6ZFrmrzFX</a> \u2014@true_bug\n\n'Uncompromising act of iron wills'\n\nAccording to local heritage expert Don Luxton, who wrote a book about the bridge with co-author Lilia D'Acres, talk of a bridge or tunnel spanning Burrard Inlet began as early as the late 19th century.\n\nVancouver was booming, including the North Shore. But a downturn in the economy in the mid-1910s led investors to drop the idea.\n\nLuxton and D'Acres write that it was the determination of one man, Alfred J.T. Taylor, that transformed the idea of connecting Vancouver to West Vancouver into an actual project.\n\n\"To build such a structure, in a frontier city during the deepest depression of the twentieth century, was an uncompromising act of iron wills,\" Luxton and D'Acres wrote.\n\nSeen from West Vancouver, the Lions Gate Bridge is backed by dark woods in Stanley Park and the illuminated skyline of Vancouver in the background. British Pacific Properties, which paid to build the bridge, also paid for lights to illuminate it as a gift for Expo '86. (Al Wilson)\n\nIn 1925 a smaller, low-level version of today's Second Narrows Bridge was built to link Vancouver to the North Shore further east. But the authors say Taylor saw great potential for growth in the undeveloped lands of West Vancouver.\n\nTaylor had connections with wealthy Britons looking to invest capital so they could avoid taxes at home. These investors, which included the Guinness family \u2014 yes, that Guinness \u2014 paid $6 million for the bridge, in large part to provide a connection to 4,000 acres of undeveloped land known today as the British Properties in West Vancouver.\n\nOver nearly two decades, Taylor also lobbied municipal and federal governments to get the project approved.\n\nThe project left residents divided \u2014 some didn't agree that a second bridge to the North Shore was necessary. Others were opposed because the road leading to it would cut through the unblemished habitat of Stanley Park.\n\nBut a shipping accident that knocked out the Second Narrows Bridge in 1930, blocking traffic for four years, reignited support for the project.\n\nTolls pay for the bridge twice\n\nThe federal government approved the bridge by royal assent in 1936. Luxton and D'Acres say that construction, relatively problem-free, began a year later.\n\nThe bridge received its finishing touches in 1939 when two signature concrete lions, created by local sculptor Charles Marega, were mounted onto pedestals at the southern entrance.\n\nToday about 60,000 vehicles cross the Lions Gate Bridge every day. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)\n\nAccording to B.C.'s Ministry of Transportation, tolls to cross the bridge cost 5\u00a2 for pedestrians and $1.25 for a weekly vehicle pass when it first opened.\n\nThose tolls continued when the province bought the Lions Gate from the private investors in 1954. That meant taxpayers essentially paid for the bridge twice, according to Luxton and D'Acres.\n\nIn 1963, the bridge's two lanes were divided into three.\n\nFate of bridge put into question\n\nLuxton and D'Acres say that talk of replacing the bridge began almost as soon as the province bought it. The Lions Gate, they write, was seen as \"outdated, old fashioned and past its prime.\"\n\nIt took decades of debate for the province to decide what it would do with the bridge which some had dubbed the \"Car-Strangled Spanner.\"\n\n\"The public debate that followed was rancorous, and pitted those in love with the car against environmentalists, heritage advocates, and neighbourhood preservationsists,\" Luxton and D'Acres wrote.\n\nThe authors point out that the Lions Gate was carrying three times its originally intended capacity. By 1972, engineers ordered emergency repairs when they found the bridge was unsafe and in a state of neglect.\n\nA Lions Gate Bridge vista do Stanley Park em Vancouver.

But for historian Atkin, it's also a source of joy every time he comes back to Vancouver from the North Shore.\n\n\"Suddenly you're on the bridge. And you've got those great views over English Bay and that extraordinary view of the skyline,\" Atkin said. \"It's coming home in a really spectacular way.\"", "In LeBron James' first season in Miami, the Heat started 9-8. In James' first season back in Cleveland, the Cavaliers began 5-7. This year, in James' first in Los Angeles, the Lakers are 7-6.\n\nEven for the best player in the world, new beginnings have never come easy.\n\nBut for Kawhi Leonard and the Toronto Raptors, the unlikely partnership couldn't have started any smoother.\n\nAt the time of the trade that sent Toronto icon DeMar DeRozan, budding centre Jakob Poeltl, and a protected first-round pick to San Antonio for Leonard and Danny Green, critics were wary of the Raptors' off-court fit.\n\nIt's no secret that DeRozan and Kyle Lowry are best friends; how would Lowry adjust? It's also no secret that Leonard is reportedly seeking a return home to Los Angeles; how would he fare in the north?\n\nAnd, most importantly: would those issues infect the basketball team on the court?\n\nOn top of the East\n\nThirteen games in and the answer is a resounding \"No.\" And in an interesting twist, two of the Raptors' top competitors in the East have struggled to re-integrate their own key players.\n\nFor various reasons, Gordon Hayward's second crack with the Boston Celtics and Markelle Fultz's first full season with the Philadelphia 76ers have not gone swimmingly. And it's left those teams staring up at the 12-1 Raptors.\n\nThe Raptors, whose one loss came without Leonard, have beaten both Atlantic division rivals and led by double digits in every game but one.\n\nSo how have the Raptors been so good at something James has now failed at thrice?\n\nFor starters, none of the off-court issues have presented themselves. Lowry didn't say a word in the off-season, which concerned some. Turns out, his reason for silence, as told to ESPN's The Undefeated, was completely rational.\n\n\"My best friend in the world [DeRozan] got traded. He was upset. Things were hectic,\" Lowry said. \"For me, I'm going to support him and I have his back. But I understand it's a business, and everyone made peace with it. And everyone continued to do great things.\"\n\nLowry leads the league with 11 assists per game, easily a career high. His shooting percentage also represents a career high (49.7 per cent). And to watch Lowry is to watch a player clearly in command of his team \u2013 someone who understands exactly where Serge Ibaka wants the ball to help him to a recent 27 of 30 shooting stretch.\n\nThe point guard also leads the league in charges drawn with nine, in case you were still concerned about effort.\n\n\"I'm fueled by everything,\" Lowry said. \"It's not even bad fuel. It's good fuel. I try to think as positive as possible. Everything happens for a reason. You can't get mad about things you can't control. All you can control is yourself.\"\n\nGood problems\n\nLowry's control is why Leonard's transition to Toronto has been so seamless. In fact, Leonard has taken to Toronto quite well.\n\n\"It's basically like being in New York,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"I'm enjoying the city so far, but I have a lot I'd like to venture off and see still.\"\n\nSo Leonard's main issue with Toronto, almost one month into his first season, is that there's too much to do. A good problem to have.\n\nIn fact, the Raptors' roster is filled with good problems. Third-string centre Greg Monroe probably doesn't deserve his end-of-bench treatment, but Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas are playing too well to be supplanted.\n\nToronto's rotation legitimately runs 11 deep, which is useful when Leonard still isn't 100 per cent healthy, and isn't yet playing back-to-backs.\n\nBut when Leonard is in the lineup, his presence is obvious. Besides averaging 24.4 points along with a career-high 7.9 rebounds per game, Leonard is a menace defensively, constantly harassing the opposing team's best player into turnovers. This was no clearer than against the 76ers when Ben Simmons committed 11 turnovers on his own.\n\nWatch Leonard's defensive dominance:\n\nToronto defeats Philadelphia 129-112, Kawhi Leonard scores 31 points. 1:26\n\nLeonard's integration into the Raptors has been simple.\n\n\"I've been playing this my whole life. It's a big life adjustment. You're in a different country. You're not used to some of the things or the cities out here.

For the next 30 years, it turned into a hobby he was willing to risk a lot for \u2014 he knew what he was doing was illegal but figured laws would eventually change.\n\nHe grew up to 30 plants at a time and said he sold the weed to friends and family. After covering his costs, he didn't profit much, he said. He kept his full time job as a painter.\n\nHe was arrested numerous times. Several convictions for cultivating and trafficking culminated in 2006 with a two-year prison term. He said he stopped growing and selling altogether after that. He had a family and decided the risk wasn't worth it anymore.\n\nNow in his 50s, he has turned toward activism and recently opened a smoking accessories store in Alberta.\n\nMike isn't his real name. CBC granted him anonymity because even though he said he's doing everything by the book these days, he fears his background could put his business in jeopardy.\n\nOn legalization day, he said 300 people showed up at his store looking for cannabis, but he no longer sells any.\n\nHe's glad weed is legal and wants to be part of the industry, but the industry won't have him.\n\nLooking in from the outside, he's not surprised supply issues are plaguing the entire country less than a month after cannabis became legal. He's also disappointed in the product licensed producers are selling.\n\nHe said if the legal market had better consulted with those who have extensive black market experience, legalization wouldn't have been off to such a rocky start.\n\n\"At the moment, it's just almost a laughing stock,\" Mike said.\n\n\"They dropped the ball, that's for sure. They made the black market stronger, really, by what they've done.\"\n\nPossession convictions to be pardoned\n\nIn Alberta, no one who has been involved in drug trafficking or has links to organized crime can get a licence to open a retail cannabis store.\n\nThat includes anyone like Mike, whose cannabis-related convictions predate legalization.\n\nHowever, charges or convictions of simple possession of cannabis wouldn't disqualify a person from applying for a retail licence, or working in a retail store.\n\n\"We've heard that some of those folks might even make for excellent retail sales staff,\" said Dave Berry, vice-president of regulatory services with the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission, which sells cannabis wholesale to retailers and online consumers.\n\nBerry said people don't need to have been formally charged or convicted with a crime related to the black market. If they can be connected to illegal drug trafficking, that's enough to deny a retail licence in Alberta.\n\nHe said he does not see those rules changing.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has confirmed the federal government will facilitate pardons for people with convictions for possession of cannabis, and his office has said more details about that process will be available in the coming weeks.\n\nMore than 500,000 Canadians have criminal records for possession of 30 grams or less of cannabis, according to a 2014 study.\n\nThere are currently no plans to pardon or expunge prior convictions for cultivation or trafficking of cannabis, which remain illegal for those without licences.\n\nSome licensed producers say they welcome those previously involved in the black market.\n\nAurora Cannabis spokeswoman Heather MacGregor said the company employs people who have previously worked in the black market. She could not immediately say whether Aurora employs anyone who has previously been charged or convicted for cultivating or trafficking cannabis, or whether the company would be willing to hire people with these specific convictions.\n\nAurora has donated to the Campaign for Cannabis Amnesty, an organization that advocates to expunge criminal records for those convicted of simple possession.\n\n\"We don't do those types of checks that exclude those people from that culture,\" MacGregor said of the company's hiring practices.\n\n\"It's pretty obvious that these people have a lot of information and knowledge and experience to share that companies who are smart want to tap into.\"\n\nHealth Canada requires executives or leaders at licensed producers, including a CEO, COO or master grower, to have security clearance, which includes a criminal record check.\n\n'The black market quality is exceptional'\n\nMike said people like him have decades of knowledge in growing and selling that would be invaluable to developing the legal market.\n\n\"There's a lot to know, it's a lot of personal tricks to the trade that you just can't learn overnight,\" he said.\n\n\"No university education growing tomatoes is going to teach you what you need to know.\"\n\nIn Alberta, retail licences continue to be issued to new stores, but those stores can't stock their shelves because the AGLC is so low on product. Its website remains sold out of most dried cannabis. Shortages have been reported across the country.\n\nNo university education growing tomatoes is going to teach you what you need to know. - Mike, former cannabis dealer and grower\n\nCannabis stores that opened on Oct. 17 are now mostly out of product, and some have had to temporarily close their doors.\n\nThere is no firm timeline for when product is expected to be back in stock in Alberta.\n\nMike said the legal market will have to improve quality and pricing to compete with the black market.\n\nHe thinks licensed producers have been rushing the curing process and cannabis has been sitting in warehouses for too long, leaving it dry and underweight in the package.\n\nMike said curing takes four to five weeks. During that time, cannabis is dried and the chlorophyll breaks down, giving it a different colour and flavour. He said the process is easier to do in small batches, and he thinks licensed producers may be rushing the process to meet market demand.\n\nThe legal market has more variety, Mike said. But the prices are \"over the top too high,\" and that has led to a drop in prices on the black market.\n\nPrices in stores can be up to $15 a gram, but the average price for a gram of black-market cannabis is around $5, he said.\n\nThe black market began improving quality, packaging and safety standards a couple of years ago to prepare for legalization, Mike said. Dealers and producers streamlined the supply chain and moved sales online.\n\n\"There's more weed around today than there ever has been in my lifetime, and it's cheaper than it's ever been in my lifetime, too,\" he said. \"The black market quality is exceptional.\"\n\nThe legal market is missing the mark when it comes to cannabis culture, Mike said. People like to smell, touch and feel a connection to the product, he said, and growers have historically been competitive about quality.\n\nMike said the legal industry is focusing on profits at the expense of quality, and the demand can't be met because there are so many regulations preventing more growers from starting up, he said.\n\nWithout loosening rules and regulations to welcome those with extensive backgrounds in the business, Mike said the legal market will struggle to compete with a stronger black market.\n\n\"The only solution that I can see is to open the door, forget about the past, and let people like me and the people I know in on the growing end of it, the supply end of it,\" Mike said.\n\n\"If they let the people in the game who know what they're doing, everything will change. The quality will go up, the supply will go up.\n\n\"Until they do that, it's just going to be a big battle, like it was in the beginning of prohibition of alcohol.\"", "Celebrities whose coastal homes have been damaged or destroyed in a Southern California wildfire or were forced to flee from the flames expressed sympathy and solidarity with less-famous people hurt worse by the state's deadly blazes, and gave their gratitude to firefighters who kept them safe.\n\n\"Returned to my house in Malibu after evacuating,\" Gerard Butler wrote in an Instagram post next to a photo that showed a burned-out structure and a badly scorched vehicle. \"Heartbreaking time across California.

And I think I've maybe done that,\" says Trudy Morgan-Cole with a laugh.\n\nMorgan-Cole's 16th novel, Most Anything You Please, spans three generations of Holloway women \u2014 Ellen, Audrey and Rachel \u2014 who own a small corner store in Rabbittown. The book starts in 1938, when the neighbourhood is on the outskirts of St. John's.

You get to help decide. (Sarah Smellie/CBC)\n\nThe corner store as the neighbourhood cornerstone\n\nMorgan-Cole lived in Rabbittown for most of her adult life, she said, and has always loved how the neighbourhood has avoided the purchase-renovate-and-re-sell cycle of gentrification and been a cheaper place to live for lower-income, working-class people and for many of the people settling in St. John's from countries around the world.\n\nBut she's been sad to see the corner stores disappear, a phenomenon not even Rabbittown could avoid.\n\n\"People tended to go to the corner shop closest to them, which might be only one block from the next corner stop shop, but you had your place that you went. And so you saw the same people over and over \u2014 the same shopkeepers but also the same neighbours shopping. It was a real piece of consistency in people's lives and that's what has been lost.\"\n\nMost Anything You Please, she said, grew out of her memories of the Rabbittown corner stores she grew up with.\n\n\"Using a family who owns a corner shop ... would be great way to explore not just kind of the rise and fall in changing fortunes of that one family ... but also in widening concentric circles: the neighborhood, the city, the province and really our whole culture.\"\n\nMost Anything You Please by Trudy Morgan-Cole is one of the 2018 NL Reads contenders.

Many other counties were expected to begin the work Monday after a weekend of recount drama in Broward and Palm Beach counties, home to large concentrations of Democratic voters.\n\nThe developments make this a tumultuous political moment in Florida. The recount process is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren't aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nIn Broward County, the recount was delayed for hours Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to accuse Broward's supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, of \"incompetence and gross mismanagement.\"\n\nBroward officials faced further headaches after acknowledging the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all the votes.\n\nGov. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for Senate, filed suit against Snipes. He's seeking a court order for law enforcement agents to impound all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots \"when not in use until such time as any recounts.\" The suit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law.\n\n'Ramp down the rhetoric'\n\nDuring an emergency hearing, a Florida judge said he's seen no evidence of wrongdoing in the vote counting in Broward County and urged all sides to \"ramp down the rhetoric.\"\n\nCircuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter said there is a need to reassure citizens that the integrity of the Florida recount is being protected.\n\nTo that point, he urged lawyers for Scott and others representing the Republican and Democratic parties and their candidates as well as the Broward County elections office to agree on some minor additions in security, including the addition of three more law enforcement officers to keep an eye on things.\n\nAnd the judge says anyone with any evidence of voter fraud or irregularities should report it to law enforcement.\n\nDemocrats allege abuse of power\n\nJuan Penalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of \"using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she didn't think her department could meet Thursday's deadline to complete that recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there.\n\nThe recount in other major population centres, including Miami-Dade, and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, has been continuing without incident.

In the Senate race, Scott's lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered.\n\nRepublicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on.\n\n'Sore loser'\n\nGillum and Nelson insist that each vote should be counted and the process should take its course.\n\nScott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by non-citizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer's objection of Palm Beach County's rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a non-citizen.\n\n\"He is trying to commit fraud to win this election,\" Scott told Fox News. \"Bill Nelson's a sore loser. He's been in politics way too long.\"\n\nNelson's campaign issued a statement later saying their lawyer wasn't authorized to object to the ballot's rejection, as \"Non-citizens cannot vote in US elections.\"\n\nGillum appeared Sunday evening at a predominantly African-American church in Fort Lauderdale, declaring that voter disenfranchisement isn't just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots with mismatched signatures that \"a volunteer may have the option of ... deciding that vote is null and void.\"\n\nBoth the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\n'Lock her up'\n\nThat didn't stop protests outside Snipes's office, where a mostly Republican crowd gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \"lock her up,\" referring to Snipes.

One protester wore a Hillary Clinton mask.\n\nRegistered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old Pompano Beach retail worker, carried a sign reading, \"I'm not here for Trump! I'm here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!\" He said the office's problems \"don't make me feel very much like my vote counted.\"\n\nFlorida also is conducting a recount in a third statewide race.

Bush the victor over Vice-President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nMuch has changed since then.\n\nIn 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates.

Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow the state requires all Florida counties to use ballots allowing voters to use a pen to mark their candidates' names, much like a student taking a multiple-choice test, and the process for recounts is clearly spelled out.", "Read Story Transcript\n\nThe rate of suicide in some Indigenous communities is so high that it starts to feel \"normal,\" according to journalist Tanya Talaga, who has studied youth in crisis for this year's Massey Lectures.\n\n\"My uncle took his life, my mother's friend took her life, my friend took their life,\" said Talaga, an Indigenous journalist at the Toronto Star.\n\n\"It's in the lexicon, it's in your everyday words and your actions, it's all around you,\" she told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.\n\n\"What is so hard for someone, who doesn't live in that community and is not surrounded by suicide, to understand is, it becomes part of your normal everyday life.\"\n\n\"It's not normal,\" she said.\n\nGrowing healthy children, it's not really rocket science - Tanya Talaga\n\nIn Inuit villages across Nunavik, Quebec's expansive northern region that is home to 12,000 people, there have been at least 13 youth suicides since the beginning of the year.

Now a new generation is adding edgy video art, photography and spoken word poetry to that mix.\n\nUma Samari is a writer and poet. She says getting the chance to showcase her work changed her life. She says her art and religion are intertwined.

Total drug crime, meanwhile, has gone down, but there's been a change in the types of drugs that are turning up on the street. And experts say that shift is connected to the increase in other types of crime.\n\nThe recent surge is \"alarming,\" says Mount Royal University justice studies professor Doug King, but it shouldn't be cause for panic.\n\nAll things considered, Calgary remains \"remarkably safe\" compared with what it was like in the past, and compared with many other cities, he says.\n\nBut let's take a closer look at the numbers to see exactly how Calgary compares.\n\nCrime severity\n\nOne tool Statistics Canada uses is the \"crime severity index.\"\n\nThis measures not just how many crimes are happening but also how serious they are, based on actual sentences handed down by the courts for each type of offence.\n\nIt all adds up to an indexed \"score\" that can be used for comparisons. A baseline score of 100 represents the national level of crime severity in 2006.\n\nFor most of the past two decades, Calgary's crime severity was lower than the national average.\n\nBut that changed with the recent spike in crime. You can see that in the green line in the graph below.\n\n(Can't see the graph? Click here for a version that should work on your mobile device.)\n\nAs you can also see from the graph, crime severity in Calgary was worse in the late 1990s and early 2000s than it is now, even with the recent increase.\n\nAnd crime here remains less severe than in other parts of Alberta.\n\n\"In relationship to places like Edmonton, we are safer in terms of crime severity and overall crime rates,\" said King.\n\nA big part of the increase in Calgary's crime severity index has to do with a spike in violent crimes.\n\nViolent crime\n\nCalgary's rate of violent crime reached a low point in 2013 but has been steadily rising since.\n\nYou can explore how various violent crimes have changed over the past 20 years using the interactive chart below. Just click on the drop-down menu to change between offences.\n\nAnd pay close attention to the numbers on the left-hand side of the chart. They represent the number of reported offences per 100,000 people.\n\n(Can't see the graph? Click here for a version that should work on your mobile device.)\n\nBut it's not just violent crimes that have been on the rise.\n\nCalgary has also experienced a sudden \u2014 and sustained \u2014 increase in property crime.\n\nProperty crime and other non-violent crime\n\nBack in 1998, Calgary's property crime rate had reached a height of 6,500 incidents per 100,000 residents.\n\nThings trended downward for the next 16 years, and property crime bottomed out in 2014 at a rate of just over 3,000.\n\nBut then in 2015, it suddenly jumped back over 4,000 \u2014 and has been stuck at roughly the same level since.\n\n(Can't see the graph? Click here for a version that should work on your mobile device.)\n\nOver the past few years, in particular, the city has seen an increase in break-ins, thefts and fraud.\n\nThis has been linked to the economic downturn, by both Calgary's former police chief and in academic research.\n\nThere's one type of crime that has actually been decreasing lately, however: Drug-related offences.\n\nDrug crime\n\nThe overall rate of drug crimes reached a 20-year low in 2017.\n\nThis was largely due to a massive decline in the number of cannabis possession offences, which are down 74 per cent from their height in 2001.\n\n(Can't see the graph? Click here for a version that should work on your mobile device.)\n\nAt the same time, however, other types of drug offences have seen big increases.\n\nPossession charges for opioids and crystal meth were almost non-existent a decade ago, but both have surged in the past few years and reached 20-year highs in 2017.\n\nThese newer types of drugs really started showing up in larger numbers back in 2014, said Calgary's acting Deputy Chief Ryan Ayliffe, and coincided with the start of the economic downturn.\n\nThat combination of factors is largely connected to the crime increase, Ayliffe said, as fewer job opportunities and an increase in drug addiction often lead people to criminal activity.\n\nAnd just a quick note: If you're looking for opioid numbers in the interactive graph above, you won't see them, directly. That's because drugs like fentanyl haven't been separately tracked by Statistics Canada, which classified them as \"other.\" (You will note the large surge in that \"other\" category, however.)\n\nStatistics Canada plans to track opioids, specifically, from 2017 onward.\n\nIn response to the changing crime trends, police have taken several steps.\n\nPolice response\n\nAyliffe said Calgary police have boosted resources in targeted areas to address specific types of crime that have been on the rise.\n\nThey've also improved intelligence sharing between their own departments and with other law-enforcement agencies that operate outside the city.\n\nPolice are also working to address addiction issues and other social conditions related to criminal activity, he said, by fostering partnerships with groups who work in those fields.\n\n\"All hands are on deck, so to speak,\" Ayliffe said. \"We're really engaging our partners within the city and all other social agencies that would have any sort of stake in this entire issue.\"\n\nAs someone who studies criminal justice, King says it's important to keep the recent crime surge in context.\n\n\"People in Calgary, people in surrounding communities, people in Canada, generally, are safer than they have been for a very long time now,\" he said.\n\n\"So we should be comforted by that.\"", "A southern Alberta family has been ordered by the Municipal District of Foothills to halt work and remove a berm on their riverfront property they built to protect themselves from flood waters.\n\nAnd, their flood fears are only being made worse by studies showing mitigation efforts put in place to protect the town of High River will see waters around their property rise even higher in a flood event.\n\nSharon McCaughan's Aldersyde home has been hit hard by floods twice in the past.\n\n\"When it's raining I have a hard time sleeping because I'm getting up in the middle of the night. I'm shining my flashlight out to and checking the river,\" she said.\n\nIn 2005, after their property was hit with more than two metres of water from the Highwood River, they built a two-metre-high berm.\n\nBut it wasn't enough to protect them from the rising waters of the 2013 flood. The four metres of water that rose caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to their property \u2014 which houses both their home and construction business.\n\nThis aerial view of the McCaughan property shows the impact of the 2013 flood. (Submitted by Sharon McCaughan)\n\nMcCaughan said while waiting for flood compensation from the provincial government, they planned to add even more height, when they found out the flood mitigation efforts in High River could send another metre of water their way.\n\nThe municipality served them with a stop-work order on Aug. 13, 2018.\n\nThe M.D. argued the berm encroaches on public land and they need a development permit to build it on the property. McCaughan said they did apply for the permit in April, but the process was taking too long and they feared their is property at risk.\n\n\"We're trying to protect ourselves. This is our livelihood, I've got four kids and a business and our home and we're trying to protect ourselves because no one is helping us,\" she said.\n\n'It's all so maddening'\n\nMcCaughan said they were given buyout offers that were too low to consider, and said it's difficult to find an acreage that will allow a residence and business on the property.\n\n\"This is our life and we can't afford to go anywhere else. And it's so maddening,\" she said.\n\nThe McCaughans have appealed the stop-work order and are rallying other property owners in the area to band together.\n\nThey have also hired a lawyer who is planning to advocate for expropriation \u2014 where the government would be forced to buy their property, as they would buy land to build a highway, because their property will be affected by the flood mitigation efforts.\n\n\"I don't know where we're going to go from here, if this doesn't come through, as my husband says, it's a death sentence, we're done,\" she said.\n\nMcCaughan said the M.D. has two weeks to decide what to do with their stop-work order. The McCaughans are hoping they will be given temporary permits to keep the dike in place.\n\nMunicipal officials declined to comment on the situation until after a decision is made within the next two weeks.\n\nWith files from Terri Trembath", "Police say they have recovered the body of a 37-year-old man who went missing after his truck fell into a river in a remote area about 40 kilometres from the town of Terra Nova.\n\nHis body was found more than a kilometre downstream from where his truck went off a bridge, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nGlovertown RCMP and the Bonavista Bay ground search and rescue team searched the shoreline Saturday while RCMP divers searched the submerged vehicle and surrounding area \"until they ran out of daylight,\" according to a release sent Monday by police.\n\nIn the end, his body was found after an air search by Universal Helicopters.\n\nA resident in the Terra Nova area shared this photo of the truck on its side in the water.

He'd have to start over with just weeks to go before the painting was due at a significant art exhibit.\n\nHockney moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s. (Hannelore Foerster/Getty Images)\n\nWorking 18 hours days for a solid two weeks before the show, Hockney has recalled he \"literally finished the painting the night before it had to be sent off to the exhibition.\" That difficult period was captured in the provocative docudrama A Bigger Splash.\n\nAnd yet, despite the recent global buzz over Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the octogenarian artist remains cool amid the hype.\n\n\"I ignore it,\" Hockney declared to Reuters Wednesday evening, as he received an artistic lifetime achievement honour from Norway's Queen Sonja in London.\n\n\"I have the vanity of an artist. I want my work to be seen, but I don't have to be seen.\"\n\nHere is a look at the pieces Hockney's painting has surpassed on the list of the most expensive works of art by living artists ever sold at auction:\n\nBalloon Dog (Orange), 1994-2000\n\nJeff Koons's Balloon Dog (Orange) is seen on display at Christie's in New York ahead of its sale in November 2013.

(Stefan Wermuth/Reuters)\n\nGermany's Gerhard Richter is another artist whose oil paintings are much coveted on the international scene. The brilliantly coloured work Abstraktes bild (1986), one of the artist's so-called squeegee paintings, sold for a whopping $46.3 million US at a Sotheby's London sale in February 2015.\n\nThis came about two years after an earlier Richter work, the 1968 oil painting Domplatz, Mailand (Cathedral Square, Milan), sold for $37.1 million US. Richter has reacted with \"horror\" to these astronomical prices.\n\n\"We artists get next to nothing from such an auction. Except for a small morsel, all the profit goes to the seller,\" he said in an interview with German daily Die Zeit. He said he tends to shut his studio door \"on most of the discussion about the market and prices.\"\n\n\"I'm good at suppressing it.\"\n\nThe Grand Snowing Mountains, 2013\n\nChinese artist Cui Ruzhuo created the multi-panelled ink painting The Grand Snowing Mountains in 2013.

(Jane Adey/CBC)\n\nWaves of Change is a CBC series exploring the single-use plastic we're discarding, and why we need to clean up our act. You can be part of the community discussion by joining our Facebook group.\n\nThere's hardly a beach in Newfoundland and Labrador where you won't come across some kind of old fishing rope. Most are made from plastic and last for decades or longer.\n\nBut there's something even more troubling, for master's student Jackie Saturno, than finding rope on beaches. She's worried about the pieces of rope that you don't see, the microscopic bits that are still out there floating around in the ocean being eaten by fish.\n\nBits of fishing rope made of plastic litter a beach in Trinity Bay. (Jane Adey CBC)\n\nSaturno studies microplastics and, in particular, how fishing ropes break down. Inside a lab room at Memorial University's Marine Institute, she's created a sort of mini-ocean environment.\n\n\"'So, we have a 1,200-litre tank and we have it filled with water \u2026 and inside we have a seabed that we constructed. It's basically a plank of wood about three feet long and there's rocks and sediment that's glued underneath using green epoxy,\" explains Saturno.\n\nSaturno had to be creative to simulate a rough ocean floor. (Jane Adey/CBC)\n\nThe abrasive, simulated seabed is key to Saturno's experiment. Using a winch-and-pulley system, controlled by a computer, fishing ropes are repeatedly dragged back and forth over the jagged plank.\n\nWhen the fishing rope repeatedly rubs against the rocky plank, it will break down. (Jane Adey/CBC)\n\n\"We're going to try to get a sense of how much plastic breaks off of different types of ropes that are normally used in Newfoundland fisheries. We're testing them to see the resilience against this kind of abrasion,\" she says.\n\nAfter consultations with fish harvesters about their gear, Saturno settled on four kinds of plastic rope: nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, and a mixture of polyethylene and polypropylene.\n\nFishing rope is made from a variety of plastics: nylon, polyethylene, and polypropylene. (Jane Adey/CBC)\n\nThe four rope types will each be tested 10 times to ensure the same results recur.\n\nAt the end of the experiment she hopes to be able to tell fishers which rope is the most durable.\n\nHer trials have just started but already Saturno is surprised by some of her findings.\n\n\"I was pretty shocked by how fast they break down. I thought it was something that I would have to have a machine going overnight and kind of \u2026 see what happened. From what I've observed, it's breaking down at a quicker rate. It looks like polyethylene is fraying a lot,\" says Saturno.\n\nSaturno uses a sieve to collect mesoplastics (five millimetres) and microplastics (less than five millimetres). (Jane Adey/CBC)\n\nEach rope is rubbed against the simulated sea floor for two hours in total. At five-minute intervals, Saturno leans in over the tank with a makeshift plastics catcher, a long pole with a sieve on one end. She scoops out the hundreds of tiny pieces of plastic that accumulate in the water.\n\n\"It's tedious \u2026 but I dry them out in a container and then we'll be quantifying them later,\" she says.\n\nSaturno dries out all the tiny pieces of plastic she collects from the water that have broken away from the fishing rope. (Jane Adey/CBC)\n\nSaturno expects it'll take a couple of months to complete her experiment.\n\nMarine Institute instructor, Brett Favaro, is one of Saturno's supervisors on the project.\n\n\"So what this could do is help people design fishing gear... that's more environmentally friendly... make the way that it's built itself stronger and also have less of an impact in terms of putting up plastics,\" explains Favaro.\n\nOnce the fishing rope microplastics are collected and counted they're kept in a jar. (Jackie Saturno)\n\nHe says the results could provide a win-win solution for harvesters.\n\n\"If we're smart about how we build our gears, our gears are going to last longer. Then, we can save money because we don't have to keep buying new gears every time they break. I think that when we're managing fisheries it's not just about how much we take from the ocean it's about how we take it from the ocean.\"\n\nFavaro says the results of this fishing rope study will be published.

It was a little bit like global warming today.\"\n\nThe hole was drilled to a depth of about 1.9 kilometres. (Submitted by Johann Helgason)\n\nResearchers had tried to drill into the ocean floor from ships, but that proved expensive and there were lots of failures. Drilling from islands was seen as a cheaper alternative.\n\nAfter erecting a huge tower, the team managed to drill the hole 15 to 20 metres deeper every day. Amid June snow flurries, researchers like Zentilli were tasked with describing, measuring and boxing all the cylinders of rock extracted from the hole.\n\n\"It was a lot of work,\" Zentilli recalled in a recent interview.\n\nThen, something went wrong. At 1919.73 metres, the drill would go no further.\n\n\"We got stuck,\" Zentilli said. \"They decided that we were not getting the results we had expected \u2026 and then they decided to stop.\"\n\nBut something also went right. Warm water started spurting out of the hole.\n\nIf there's one thing to know about Icelanders, it's that they love their warm water.\n\nDalhousie University professor emeritus Marcos Zentilli travelled to Iceland in 1978 to work on the project, which unexpectedly brought hot water to the Earth's surface.

You can imagine how nice it was, from the dark winter cold night after a beer in the pub, to go there.\"\n\nThe communal hot tub was big enough to fit 10 or 15 people, he said. But two people was all it took to produce at least one unanticipated byproduct of the drilling project.\n\n\"As the story says, there was a few babies made there,\" Sigurdsson said. \"I was not there myself, but the story tells that that is the reason for many kids who was made there.\"\n\nAfter the project's discovery of geothermal energy in the area, holes were drilled in the nearby town of Eskifjordur, Iceland.

Guaranteed,\" he said.\n\nMurie said when B.C. started seizing the cars of impaired drivers years ago, there was an immediate effect.\n\n\"We know in British Columbia, when they started impounding vehicles in 2010, just for three days, they had a 50 per cent drop in alcohol-related fatalities.

On Tuesday, Calgary voters will go to the polls to register their opinion on whether or not they want to host the world. The vote is technically not binding, but make no mistake, the future of the bid hangs in the balance of the results.\n\nCalgary has been down this road before, having hosted the Winter Olympics back in 1988. The question is, does the city want to go down that road again? That has fuelled much passion and debate in the months leading up to this week's vote.\n\nWatch Scott Russell's interview with Mary Moran on why she would vote \"Yes\":\n\nCBC Sports' Scott Russell sits down with Mary Moran, CEO of the group BidCo, on why pursuing the 2026 Olympics is the right decision for not only Calgary, but Canada as a whole. 9:41\n\nDifferent city than 30 years ago\n\nCalgary is a very different city than it was 30 years ago. Its economy has been hampered by historically low fuel prices and supporters of the bid have painted the 2026 Games as the economic lift Calgary needs.\n\n\"This isn't going to solve all problems, but it can be a great launching pad for us to have a purpose \u2014 to more clearly define what our economic objectives are and to really start attracting people talent in companies here around the Games or delivering on the Games. So if you look back at '88, it's precisely what it did,\" says Mary Moran, CEO of the Calgary 2026 bid committee.\n\nThe job of Moran's group has been to sell this bid to both city council and the citizens of Calgary. She says hosting another Olympics would allow the city to show its evolution into a world class city.\n\n\"There's a lot of activity that's happening here that's a bit of an untold story about Calgary,\" Moran said. \"I look at this as a platform. We're on the global stage. We can tell a different story about Calgary and that's the best thing that the Games provides us with.\"\n\nCBC Sports' Jamie Strashin examines the factors Calgarians will weigh before voting:\n\nCBC Sports' Jamie Strashin brings you up to date on everything you need to know about the upcoming Calgary Olympic bid plebiscite which takes place on November 13. 2:56\n\nIs the Olympic mystique fading?\n\nNumerous opposition groups have formed around the bid, arguing that the Olympics is the wrong idea at the wrong time.\n\n\"1988 was a great time for Calgary, but it was a completely different time,\" says Erin Waite, one of the organizers behind the opposition group No Calgary Olympics.\n\n\"There is a ton of talent, expertise and creativity in this city. Let's galvanize that toward a project that will do something for the next generation,\" Waite says. \"I don't think helping a few winter athletes come to a party in 2026 for a few weeks is really the investment we should be considering.\"\n\nCalgary's vote comes at time when some feel the Olympic mystique is fading, due to unwieldy hosting costs that inevitably balloon beyond initial estimates, and to the perception that the IOC is corrupt and mismanaged.\n\nBid supporters and the IOC organizers have worked diligently to counter this narrative. Cost forecasts this far away from the Games historically miss the mark. In the case of this bid, taxpayers are being asked to contribute $3 billion \u2014 a big number, but small by Olympic standards. The lower cost projections stem from the IOC's efforts to make hosting the Games more attractive and affordable. In Calgary's case, many of the big ticket items, like a potential new NHL-size arena, have been sidelined, with the focus instead on rehabbing existing venues.\n\nWhat is a plebiscite?\n\nCBC Sports' Anson Henry breaks down the referendum facing Calgary voters. 1:20\n\n\"These Games make sense. The Games make sense for Calgary. Calgary makes sense for the Games. There are many opportunities and risks. Where we stand, we don't see them because you have the culture of hosting events. You have done the Games before,\" says the IOC's Christophe Dubi, who has frequently visited Calgary in recent months.\n\nDubi says he hopes Calgarians are aware of the IOC's leaner approach.\n\n\"You can have different opinions, but at the same time the promoters of the Games have to provide information. This is how this referendum will be won,\" Dubi says.\n\nDivided city council\n\nCalgary city council's next move will obviously be guided by this vote. On recent Olympic-related votes leading up to Tuesday's, council has been divided about whether to keep going.\n\nSo what's the magic number that will push council to go ahead?\n\nMoran says she'd like to see 50 per cent or more of voters support an Olympic bid. \"But you can also win the Games with a strong plebiscite. And so you know, the stretch goal for me would be closer to 60.\"\n\nThe No side hopes for an equally strong result. \"I would love to see a good turnout and a strong no vote percentage,\" Waite says. \"That's the easiest thing to respond to for our elected officials. No question it gets tougher if that percentage is more of a split vote.\"\n\nIf Calgary does choose to put a bid forward for the 2026 Winter Olympics, the IOC will announce a winner in June.", "Previous Next\n\nIt's mid-November.

In the early 1900s, flooding of the water systems through the Kawarthas with the completion of the Trent-Severn Waterway almost eradicated the wild rice in the area.\n\nJames Whetung has been seeding the Tri-Lake area with wild rice for decades. (Kim Muskratt Waaseyaa-Kwe)\n\nThe lack of access to this traditional food source is one of the reasons James Whetung says he set out to restock the lakes with wild rice more than 30 years ago.\n\n\"I went and talked to the Elders and they told me where all the wild rice was used to grow,\" he said.\n\n\"There was none there at the time I started planting seeds so I wanted to help rejuvenate our culture.\"\n\nThe Tri-Lake area is a water system in the Kawarthas made up of three lakes: Pigeon Lake, Buckhorn Lake and Chemong. Curve Lake First Nation, where Whetung is from, is on a peninsula of land surrounded on one side by Buckhorn Lake and on the other Upper Chemong Lake.\n\nWhetung runs a business, Black Duck Wild Rice, and harvests the grain for sale commercially. He said he also provides opportunities for community members and local schools to bring classes in to learn about the process.\n\n\"It's our inherent right to be able to do that and the Williams Treaty enshrined our rights in the constitution,\" said Curve Lake councillor Lorenzo Whetung.\n\n\"All of the teachings tell you to put back and that's what he's doing, he's putting back what he takes.\"\n\n'Total disrespect'\n\nResidents on Pigeon Lake see things differently.\n\n\"He's destroying our lake,\" said Meip Leerentveld, whose family has owned property on the lakeshore for 49 years.\n\n\"We don't have a problem with wild rice here other than what he's doing and his total disrespect.\"\n\nLeerentveld and her husband Brock Walsh said that over the last few years they've been watching their shoreline be consumed by thick reeds as the wild rice fields expand.\n\nBrock Walsh and Meip Leerentveld have had a house on Pigeon Lake for 19 years built on property that has been in Leerentveld's family for 49 years. While the growing season is over, a few wild rice stalks poke out of the water behind the couple, far less they say than there was a month ago. (Rhiannon Johnson/CBC)\n\n\"He has to stop seeding the lakes because there's no boating anymore, there's no swimming, there's nothing,\" said Leerentveld.\n\nThe couple said their grandchildren don't come visit anymore because the waterways around their house are so clogged up with rice, so they spend time elsewhere.\n\nThey're also unhappy with Whetung's use of an airboat for harvesting, which they said is noisy as he drives up and down the lake and further assists in the spreading of the rice.\n\nConcern for property values\n\nThey said the roar of the boat is affecting their quality of life, triggering anger and anxiety whenever they hear it approaching.\n\n\"We all live here and we should all live here in some sort of harmony,\" said Leerentveld.\n\n\"They should put a designated area in if that's what they want to do.\"\n\nThere are also concerns the wild rice will affect property values.\n\nResidents complain the wild rice is clogging up their shore lines and affecting boating and swimming.

But she added that it's not easy to tell how much the wild rice has affected real estate on Pigeon Lake, compared to other regions in the Kawarthas, given the red hot real estate market over the past few years.\n\n'They bought a wetland'\n\nAccording to Parks Canada, the area of Pigeon Lake is 5,246 hectares and the wild rice covers 495 hectares or 9.4 per cent of the waterway.\n\n\"While wild rice may appear to be dominant in some areas, it is actually part of a healthy, diverse plant community of submerged and floating leaf plants beneath the water surface,\" said Karen Freeley, communications and acting Indigenous affairs officer for the Ontario Waterways Unit of Parks Canada, in an email.\n\nThe Tri-Lake area in the Kawarthas is a water system consisting of Pigeon, Buckhorn and Chemong Lakes. (Google Maps)\n\n\"The presence of wild rice is a positive indication of the overall health of the ecosystem.\"\n\nJames Conolly, an archeologist at nearby Trent University who is studying the environmental history of the Kawartha lakes area, said the lake is going through a process of re-wilding after more than a hundred years of farming and logging in the area.\n\nThe geographic area that Pigeon Lake sits on was once a creek surrounded by wetlands, according to Conolly.\n\n\"They didn't realize it, but they bought a wetland,\" he said.\n\n\"Pigeon [Lake] was really badly hit by the dams, but now of course that's where all the cottages are.\"\n\nPlan for consultation\n\nThe meeting at the Ennismore community centre in Selwyn Township was organized by a resident group called Save the Tri-Lakes Initiative. Over the years lakefront residents have lobbied multiple organizations and levels of government to intervene.\n\nIn 2015, they applied for and received a permit from Park Canada to clear aquatic weeds. The clearing of the wild rice beds was stopped after First Nations groups complained they had not been consulted.\n\nWhetung was not present at the recent meeting.\n\n\"I want to have food security and seed sovereignty for us as a nation, not a government-named First Nation but as a nation of Anishnaabek. We need that food for our culture,\" Whetung told CBC.\n\n\"I'm not out to negotiate my right to gather or plant seeds. There's an inherent right; no government can take that from me.\"\n\nA number of elected representatives sat in at the Ennismore meeting that concluded with a rough plan to begin a three-month consultation between local governments, First Nations and community members to try to find an amicable compromise or some sense of direction moving forward.", "As it marks its first anniversary, an experiment in giving transit, pedestrians and cyclists priority on a main downtown thoroughfare remains a polarizing and politically charged pilot project.\n\nOne year ago Monday, the city closed King Street to through traffic, except for TTC vehicles and emergency services, between Jarvis and Bathurst streets.\n\nThe trial run has been celebrated in some circles and denounced in others, drawing divisions among many who spend their days in the area.\n\n\"It's quite pointless to be honest,\" said Erica Karbelnik, 29, a chef who lives and works along the test corridor. \"Streetcars are still backed up and they are still packed, especially at five o'clock.\"\n\nShe's been left waiting more than 30 minutes for a spot as streetcars too full to take on more passengers rolled by, she said.\n\n\"I don't think it's improved anything.

Sorry to put that harshly, but that's how I feel,\" said Karbelnik.\n\nOthers, like Don Hutton, say the stretch of King Street under study is much improved.

I always hear that argument about how it's affected businesses poorly, but you hear that whenever you put in like bike lanes or you do whatever restricts car access and parking.\"\n\nCity staff have so far declined to comment publicly on the future of the experiment, saying instead they will wait for the pilot project to run its course through to the end of December.\n\n\"Staff are expected to bring a report that includes details related to the King Street Pilot to an upcoming meeting of the executive at city council,\" said Eric Holmes, a spokesperson with the city, in an email.\n\nData for September and October will be available in the coming weeks, says Holmes. However, a timeframe for when November and December data will be available has not yet been determined.\n\nThe city's chief planner, Gregg Lintern, wants the timeframe of the $1.5 million project to be extended to give staff time to properly analyze the data.\n\n\"We've got to finish with all that data collection and get a really good solid analysis undertaken so we can give some good advice to council about whether or not this should become permanent and how it could be employed \u2014 in some way, shape or form \u2014 in other areas of the city,\" Lintern told CBC Radio's Metro Morning on Monday.\n\nTTC says pilot has improved reliability\n\nFrom the Toronto Transit Commission's perspective, the pilot project has been a resounding success.\n\n\"There were three things that the TTC said it wanted to measure: ridership, reliability and travel time. And those three measures, from a transit perspective, were what we wanted to see improvements on, and we have seen improvements in all three,\" said TTC spokesperson Brad Ross.\n\nRidership data before the pilot indicated 72,000 riders a day on the 504 King car, which is the TTC busiest surface route in the entire network. The latest figures indicate that's grown to 84,000 boardings, a 12 per cent boost in all-day ridership, according to Ross.\n\nAs for travel time, the trip during peak traffic hours eastbound between Bathurst and Jarvis streets before the pilot was about 15 minutes and three seconds. Ross said that figure has been reduced to 14 minutes.\n\n\"And so you may think, well, that's only a minute and point three seconds. It actually makes a significant difference over the course of a route, because that means that reliability then improves. We've seen a reliability improvement of about 82 per cent,\" said Ross.\n\nTTC spokesperson Brad Ross said ridership, reliability and travel time have all improved in the study area.

But it's a vast improvement to what it was and we continue to work on making it better,\" he said.\n\nTTCriders, a transit advocacy group with close ties to unions, recently held a Twitter forum on the topic. The organization said the pilot project has made its members commutes more reliable.\n\n\"The King Street Pilot Project has dramatically improved the quality of the ride for me between my home, which is off Roncesvalles, and work, which is downtown,\" said John Richmond, TTCriders member and regular King streetcar user.\n\nBut he agreed that the ultimate success or failure of the project has become politicized.\n\n\"Transit is always a political issue by its very nature,\" Richmond said. \"I think a lot of the public understand there are vested interests and change is difficult.\"\n\nLintern pointed out that the project has had a \"very limited impact\" on downtown drivers.\n\n\"The traffic impacts have been absorbed in the background traffic of the city's downtown,\" he said. \"That's also very positive for the battle on congestion that is so much on top of people's minds.\"\n\nDisagreements about data\n\nBut along with forcing drivers to turn right at the end of each block, the pilot project has also meant the loss of 180 parking spots on the street. Some King Street business owners say that, on top of traffic restrictions, has hurt their bottom line.\n\nTony Elenis, president and CEO of the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association, said members felt the impact immediately and some never recovered. Eleven restaurants in the area have closed since the pilot began, according to Elenis.\n\n\"Some of them chains, some of them independent restaurants. So that also has to be looked at ... eleven restaurants, in an area that used to have dynamite business before, are gone. It is totally not a success story.\"\n\nOver the past year, the city ran promotions, including two-hour free parking, free lunches and a competition to build street art installations.\n\nTony Elenis, president and CEO of the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association, said the numbers the city has released showing a slight increase in spending in the pilot study area are \"misleading and frankly irresponsible.\" (Oliver Walters/CBC)\n\nThe city also released customer spending data showing an increase of 0.3 per cent year-over-year between May and June.\n\n\"The change that we've seen in the first six months of the pilot project timeline has been very similar to the economic life of the area in the last six months before the pilot started,\" said Lintern.\n\nBut Elenis argued that conclusion was misleading. The data came from only one payment processor \u2014 Moneris Solutions Corp. \u2014 and not only included businesses in the pilot area but also transactions done by businesses on the PATH network within the study area.\n\nHe is not the only person who has concerns about the quality of the data being provided.\n\nRobin Lobb is executive director of the Toronto Entertainment District Residents Association.\n\n\"Crucial minutes have been saved for what will be millions of riders and no one can argue with that data,\" Lobb wrote in a statement to CBC Toronto.\n\nMore than 8,000 tickets have been handed out since the pilot began and it's still common to see motorists disobeying the rules.

That hasn't been easy in recent years and farmers are sceptical about what's in store in the coming months.\n\nTo address the problem of grain backlogs and other transportation issues, the federal government passed bill C-49 earlier this year. The legislation should provide better service to farmers because of penalties for train companies that fail to deliver promised rail cars for grain shipments on time.\n\n\"It will force the hand somewhat of railways to be more responsive to the needs of those shipping grain,\" said Renn Breitkreuz of Alberta Canola.\n\nConcerns over railway space exist especially as the volume of oil shipments increases every month in Canada, setting new records along the way.\n\n\"We would prefer if things like oil that can move on a pipeline, do move on a pipeline. You can't really use a grain pump to move my grain to the West Coast, but would love it if I could,\" said D'Arcy Hilgartner of Alberta Pulse Growers. \"Whether it's Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba, we need that market access.\"\n\nWhile Canada, Mexico and the United States reached the USMCA trade deal in recent months, some farming groups will lobby to make sure the agreement is signed and becomes official, while those negatively impacted will seek adequate financial compensation.\n\nCarbon tax\n\nAlberta and B.C. already have a carbon tax in place and farmers in other provinces will be hit with the federal levy on January 1, 2019.\n\nThe Alberta and B.C. governments both have exemptions for the agriculture sector, including on purple farm fuels, but farmers do have to pay the increased expense on propane, natural gas and other fuels.\n\nHilgartner described the impact as \"incremental,\" but said any added cost is challenge because farmers can't pass those costs on to consumers. Farmers receive whatever price the market is willing to pay.\n\n\"Anything that could make us uncompetitive, we will watch,\" he said.\n\nBesides the tax, farm groups say they also want to discuss carbon offset programs and other regulations.\n\nAlberta's carbon tax was introduced in 2017 and the rate increased in 2018. The levy will say at $30/tonne until 2021.\n\nResearch money\n\nSome farmers want cash to further research issues such as crop production, marketing and product development.\n\nLenz, with Alberta Barley, said public research dollars have dried up in the province, leaving his organization to pickup the tab.\n\n\"We've seen a lack of that in the last four years with the current government,\" he said.\n\nAlberta Barley is pushing political parties in the province for cash towards research projects such as crop production, marketing and product development. 0:45\n\nAlberta Barley will be meeting with the NDP and the UCP to press both parties for commitments on this issue.\n\n\"They need to understand [this] is very important to us.\"\n\nSpread of disease\n\nOutside of the crop sector, few people have heard of fusarium head blight before, but the disease has spread across the country, even to Prince Edward Island. The fungus impacts crops such as wheat, barley, oats and corn, and has cost Canadian farmers between $50 million to $300 million annually since the early 1990s.\n\nThe Alberta government took a zero-tolerance approach to the disease to stop its spread. However, farmers now want the government to change their stance since fusarium is already beyond containment.\n\nThe provincial government has an in-depth management plan for the disease, however some argue loosening the zero tolerance approach to the disease could open the doors for more research into how to treat fusarium and develop resistant seed.\n\n\"Right now, research facilities within Alberta can't bring in fusarium infested seed to do research on,\" said Kevin Bender, with the Alberta Wheat Commission. \"It's really a serious problem.\"", "Leo Muldoon was critically injured when a tornado tore through Dunrobin this fall, but he has no plans of letting that slow him down.\n\nThe 78-year-old farmer suffered cracked ribs, a collapsed lung and a blow to the head after being thrown from a ladder while fixing a roof on his farm Sept. 21.\n\nNow, he's telling the customers of his snowplow business that he fully intends on meeting his commitments this winter.\n\n\"When asked what he was most looking forward to about getting home, dad's response was driving his tractor,\" his daughter Melanie wrote recently on the Dunrobin Disaster Relief social media page.\n\n\"With this in mind, along with the fact that his doctor says it is very reasonable to assume he will be up to snowplowing, it is his intention to continue his business without interruption.\"\n\nLeo Muldoon is pushed in a wheelchair by Bruyere Hospital communications director Amy Porteous.

Unlike manufacturing, for example, it's a prime candidate for job growth.\n\nCanada used to be a Top 10 destination for international tourists, but since 2000 has slipped to 17th place.\n\nThe Liberals are quick to blame the previous Conservative government for the slide, pointing to its cuts to the budget of Destination Canada, the Crown corporation tasked with promoting Canadian tourism worldwide.

(Monica Martin)\n\nHowever, little did he know there were many more branches on his family tree.\n\nEight years ago, Bowles reached out to a Quebec government agency to get in touch with his biological mother.\n\n\"Just to tell her, you know, look, I turned out OK. I had a great life, a wonderful life. And to thank her because it could have ended up a lot worse,\" Bowles said.\n\nWhile he found out she had died years before, he also learned a few details about his father \u2014 that he was listed as a tall French-Canadian who wore glasses and was a few years younger than his mother.\n\nMarla Glazer says it's been a surreal experience discovering she has a half-brother \u2014 and while they haven't yet met, she expects the meeting to be emotional. (Submitted)\n\nThat was all he knew until last fall, when Bowles did a genealogy test and was matched with Marla Glazer's family.\n\nGlazer already has two full siblings, a step-brother and half-brother. The discovery of yet another half-sibling, she said, was surreal.\n\n\"How could I have another brother?\" Glazer said. \"It was very surprising.\"\n\nAfter a little digging and some conversations with her father's siblings \u2014 he passed away in 2009 \u2014 Glazer said she's convinced her father likely had a relationship with another woman before her parents were married.\n\nShe doesn't think, however, he knew about Bowles.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what happened 61 years ago. He's here now,\" she said.\n\nBowles now knows that on his father's side alone, he has four half-siblings, 14 uncles and aunts, and 45 cousins.\n\nWhile Bowles and Glazer haven't met yet, they speak on the phone several times a week and are expecting an emotional encounter when they finally meet face-to-face.\n\n\"I imagine there's going to be some tears,\" said Bowles. \"I'm probably just going to break down.\"\n\nChris Langevin (left) and his brother John (right), met with their half-brother Kevin Hall (centre) last summer.

They lived on the same street as another family, the Halls.\n\nLangevin's parents and the Halls were best friends, he said. When the Halls moved and Langevin's parents separated, his father moved to be near the Halls \u2014 and that was when Kevin Hall was born.\n\nWhen Langevin signed up for a genealogy test last winter, he didn't expect to get a message in April from Hall, who lives in B.C., wondering why the test showed he was related to his former neighbours.\n\nHall said it was shocking to find out about his \"other\" family.\n\nHe'd always known he was the baby of the Hall family, but now knows he's the baby of two families, and now has a whole new set of siblings.\n\nLangevin welcomed the news, and the pair met up in July, along with Langevin's brother John and one of their sisters.\n\n\"I was extremely excited to know that I even had another little brother,\" Langevin said. \"We're all just so happy to have Kevin in our life.\"", "The City of Toronto is putting the brakes on the potential purchase of a financially troubled hotel now housing around 500 homeless people and asylum seekers, despite quietly making a bid for the facility earlier this year.\n\nWith its shelter system at capacity, city officials have since 2017 used the Toronto Plaza Hotel to house newly arrived refugees and homeless families from the charitable Fred Victor Centre.\n\nThe city has signed at least $4.5 million in contracts with Alternative Living Solutions Inc. (ALS), a private contractor, to house and feed those staying at the 199-room hotel near the juncture of Highways 401 and 400.\n\nHowever, ALS doesn't actually own the hotel. The company has a deal with Virk Hospitality, the Plaza's owner, which was placed into court-ordered receivership in July. Virk also owes the city about $150,000 in unpaid property taxes.\n\nOn Monday, after this story was published, a city spokesperson issued a statement confirming officials with the real estate division have found there isn't a business case for buying the site.\n\n\"As it was a large site, it would have been for broader city needs, not solely shelter, support and housing,\" said Tammy Robbinson in an email to CBC Toronto.\n\n\"It has now been determined that this wouldn't be possible and the purchase is not being pursued.\"\n\nWith the deal scrapped, the city is risking a private developer snapping up the seven-acre property and forcing hundreds of people back into Toronto's shelter system.\n\nThe court case\n\nWhile the Toronto Plaza Hotel is full almost every night, it's facing serious financial problems. A court-appointed receiver is now trying to recoup as much money as possible from Virk Hospitality to pay back about $31 million the company owes to creditors.\n\nAn ongoing Ontario Superior Court case has provided details about the hotel's finances.\n\nSome 500 people are currently staying at the Toronto Plaza Hotel, even though some of the rooms are off limits due to mould issues. (Paul Smith/CBC)\n\nJustice Glenn A. Hainey placed Virk Hospitality into receivership, finding the company had failed to meet its mortgage obligations by redirecting some $3 million to numbered companies controlled by one of Virk's owners.\n\nWhile Virk and ALS are separate entities, a search of corporate records shows that businessman Enzo Mizzi is an officer of both companies.\u200b Mizzi has been challenging the receivership in court.\n\nHis lawyer told CBC Toronto, while Mizzi may have transferred money to other companies he controls, he did so to pay for renovations to the hotel. \"It was technically not permitted,\" said lawyer Micheal Simaan.\n\nBut the hotel residents \"have always been his utmost concern,\" Simaan said. \"He was always making sure they would be taken care of.\"\n\nHainey has also ordered Mizzi to return $186,000 he allegedly withdrew from a bank account that is used to pay to house and feed the refugees living at the Plaza.\n\nThe sale\n\nSimaan confirmed the City of Toronto had already made one attempt to buy the Plaza, although it's unclear how much was offered for the property.\n\nThe hotel has been appraised by the court-ordered receiver but that value is confidential, Simaan said. However, he claims fair market value is \"at least\" $35 million.\n\nThe city has been relying on the hotel to shelter homeless people and asylum seekers since 2017. (Paul Smith/CBC News)\n\nThe city would be considered a \"captive buyer,\" he said, and in his opinion, it would be a good investment for taxpayers.\n\nVirk originally purchased controlling shares of the property in 2016 for $17.5 million. It's unclear how much has been spent on renovating the property since.\n\nCBC Toronto has learned that two floors of the hotel, including about 35 rooms, are currently closed due to mould problems.\n\nHowever, the lucrative city contracts \u2014 worth millions annually \u2014 add considerable value to the hotel for any would-be buyers.\n\nToronto's potential bid\n\nPreviously, city spokesperson Natasha Hinds Fitzsimmins told CBC Toronto the city hasn't made a decision on whether it should step in and buy the Plaza.\n\nThat's at odds with the city's own documents and information from people with direct knowledge of the situation.\n\nThe Plaza is just one of a number of hotels the city uses. The city's own shelter system consistently operates above the 90 per cent capacity target set by city council.\n\nCBC Toronto located a September 2018 contract between the city and the receiver that shows the city has already made at least one offer to buy the hotel.\n\n\"The owner of the property had attempted to sell the property earlier this year and the city had submitted an offer,\" states a document form the City of Toronto's Real Estate Services division.\n\nThe document also reveals the city currently has a signed agreement with the receiver to enter the hotel \"for the purpose of undertaking a building condition survey.\"\n\n\"The city is seeking to acquire the property, which consists of 199 rooms and seven acres of land, for municipal initiatives,\" reads the agreement.\n\n\"Real Estate Services is recommending that the required due diligence for acquiring the property be completed prior to any open market offer due dates in order to strengthen the city's offer.\"\n\nIn other words, the city has already signed an agreement, with the intention of taking a second run at buying the hotel.\n\nBut Fitzsimmins maintains the city hasn't yet resolved to buy the facility.\n\n\"The purpose of this document was to obtain authority to enter into a licence agreement with the receiver so that we could complete our due diligence,\" she stated in an email. \"The city is still in the process of completing its due diligence on the property, which will form the basis of any bid, should the city submit one.\"\n\nWhat happens if city doesn't buy hotel?\n\nThe city now has to hope the hotel's next buyer continues to rent the hotel rooms to the city at the current, discounted rate of about $50 a night (plus food costs), or scramble to rehouse those living there.\n\nCity shelters likely aren't an option for the families, and housing availability is notoriously tight throughout Toronto.\n\nAccording to an October 2017 joint report from the city's finance and shelter officials, Toronto's public shelters are already stretched to \"over capacity\" and affordable housing is increasingly difficult to find.\n\nAbout 400 other homeless people or refugees have already been moved out of the city due to lack of affordable housing space in Toronto.\n\nThe city is downplaying those concerns.\n\n\"As is done on a regular basis, the city relies on additional hotel or motel accommodation to address capacity issues for families and refugee claimants,\" Hinds Fitzsimmins said.\n\nFor now, those staying at the Toronto Plaza Hotel are still being taken care of.", "Canada is failing to meet federal flu vaccination goals as Canadians continue to balk at rolling up their sleeves.\n\nJust 38 per cent of Canadians were vaccinated during last year's flu season, according to an internal Public Health Agency of Canada report obtained under Access to Information laws.\n\n\"Too few,\" noted the report's author.\n\nWhile the vaccination programs themselves fall under provincial jurisdiction, the Public Health Agency promotes the vaccinations nationally and monitors the spread of flu and flu-like illnesses.\n\nThe agency hired the research firm L\u00e9ger to ask Canadians in early 2018 whether they had received the shot or spray \u2014 and if not, why not. The results were then shared in multiple internal reports.\n\nThe number of Canadians reporting vaccinations has basically flatlined since 2015, the first year the agency started surveying Canadians. At the time, 34.3 per cent of Canadians said they had been vaccinated.\n\nMost respondents said they didn't get the shot because they didn't think they needed one, or they believe it doesn't work.\n\n\"Recent reports in the media regarding the low effectiveness of the influenza vaccine can be contributing to this belief,\" says the agency's analysis.\n\nDr. Howard Njoo, deputy chief public health officer at the Public Health Agency of Canada, said they're looking into why so many people aren't getting the shot.\n\n\"We recognize people have busy lives,\" he said. \"And if there's anything that we can do systematically, from a program delivery point of view at a local level, to make it easier for people to get the flu vaccine, to take time out of their busy schedules, I think that that's certainly something that's encouraged.\n\n\"Even if you don't think that you personally are at risk, it's important to get the flu vaccine because you can also protect your loved ones, those who might be at a higher risk because of chronic diseases.\"\n\nDr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, takes viewers' questions about the flu shot 11:57\n\nSeniors more likely to get vaccinated\n\nAccording to the report, the agency set a goal of getting 80 per cent of high-risk Canadians vaccinated, but fell short.\n\nJust 39 per cent of adults with chronic medical diseases bothered with the shot.\n\nThe health agency also zoomed in on some of the survey data to get a sense of how many young children are getting the flu shot. Kids under the age of five face a higher risk of getting sick.\n\nThe report showed the majority (63 per cent ) of children aged six to 59 months in surveyed households were not vaccinated.\n\nAgain, when asked why, parents said they didn't think the vaccination was needed.\n\nOn the positive side, about 71 per cent of seniors \u2014 another one of the health agency's targeted high risk groups \u2014 were vaccinated last winter, getting the closest to the set target.\n\n\"We recognize that we have to be realistic,\" said Njoo. \"And so if we aim for this [80 per cent] coverage goal for these three main groups, then over time I think as those coverage rates improve then, just by sort a spillover effect, it will also improve rates overall for the general population.\n\n\"Obviously, it would be good if everyone were able to, you know, get that kind of coverage.\"\n\nOn average, says the agency, the flu sends 12,200 Canadians to hospital and kills 3,500 a year \u2014 \"an underappreciated contributor to mortality.\"", "It was, by all accounts, an extraordinary scene \u2014 one that stunned the usually raucous House of Commons into an uncomfortable, frozen silence.\n\nIt was March 3, 1919. Sam Hughes, the country's former minister of militia and defence, rose to deliver a caustic condemnation of Canada's top battlefield commander, who only months earlier had led his troops to victory over Germany.\n\nThe focus of his tirade was the decision by Lt-.Gen. Arthur Currie to order the capture on Mons, Belgium, on the eve of the Nov. 11, 1918 Armistice.\n\nAs Currie was being f\u00eated internationally for the victory, Hughes insisted that the general should have been court-martialed instead for \"needlessly sacrificing the lives of Canadian soldiers.\"\n\nIt was an eye-popping performance, even for a politician as volatile \u2014 and as discredited \u2014 as Hughes was at the time. (Hughes entered Prime Minister Robert Borden's cabinet as defence minister in 1911. His poor organizational skills, fondness for patronage and stubborn defence of the failure-prone Ross rifle led to his dismissal from cabinet in late 1916.)\n\n\"You cannot find one Canadian soldier returning from France who will not curse the name of the officer who ordered that attack on Mons,\" said Hughes, who had carried a personal grudge against Currie since the general refused to accept the MP's son as a division commander.\n\nGen. Sam Hughes, right, and fellow officers looking over ruins in Arras, France, in August 1916. (Library and Archives Canada/The Vimy Foundation)\n\nAfter the speech, no one on either side of the aisle stood up to defend Currie. \"Hughes's allegations,\" historian Tim Cook told CBC News, \"hung like a pall over Parliament.\"\n\nMany of Canada's First World War 100th anniversary celebrations this year were focused on Mons, the former Belgian coal-mining city Canadian troops captured on the morning of the ceasefire.\n\nThe bitter personal and political legacies of that final battle and those that preceded it have largely disappeared into the mists of history, their significance lost on most Canadians.\n\nThere was a perception abroad at the time \u2014 both at home and among the troops still overseas \u2014 that in the battle for Mons and during the last 100 days of the war, Canadian soldiers had been pushed beyond all reasonable limits.\n\nBetween early August and the end of the war in November, over 45,000 Canadian soldiers died, were wounded or went missing.\n\n\"His own soldiers in those final battles and after the Armistice of November 11th questioned the cost, as did Canadians at home,\" said Cook. His book The Madman and the Butcher is a dual biography of Currie and Hughes that explores the controversy among Canadians at the time over the heavy price in blood and tears the country paid for its part in the victory of 1918.\n\nThat controversy has haunted Canadians through every war since. During the recent war in Afghanistan, political and military leaders bemoaned what they saw as the morale-sapping media focus on the repatriation of fallen soldiers.\n\n\"I think the challenge then, and ever since, has been \u2014 how do you measure victory on the battlefield?\" Cook said.\n\nCurrie may been the visible symbol to which Canadians attached their grief, disillusionment and anger following the Great War, but the burden of balancing lives against mission goals weighs on today's commanders as well.\n\nChief of the Defence Staff Gen. Jonathan Vance at the UN base in Gao, Mali, where he arrived with Canadian troops on June 24, 2018. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\nGen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's current chief of the defence staff, was a combat commander in Kandahar, responsible for ordering young men and women into missions that sometimes took their lives.\n\nVance told CBC News that, if he could have a conversation with Currie today, he'd probably ask him how he worked out what commanders today call \"the value proposition\" \u2014 whether the objective is worth the cost in blood.\n\n\"'How did it feel, general, to achieve those objectives, but [in one instance] it took 9,000 lives to do it?'\" Vance said. \"It would be a private question \u2014 'How did you deal with that?'\"\n\nCurrie returned to Canada from Europe in August 1919. Cook's research shows that he received no hero's welcome; virtually no dignitaries greeted him when he stepped off the boat in Halifax. When it came time for Parliament's formal welcome, Prime Minister Robert Borden was out of town. Women in the public gallery reportedly hissed when Lt-.Gen. Currie's name was mentioned.\n\nHis family felt the pain and it echoed down the generations.\n\nCurrie's great-granddaughter, Catherine Moore, was born decades after he died, but the stories lived on through her great-grandmother and mother.\n\nLike Vance, Moore said she would like to know how her great-grandfather coped with the burdens the war left behind.\n\n\"I would probably just want to have a long chat and really try to understand what it was like for him to be in those battles, to make those tough calls and decisions and how he felt about those losses,\" she told CBC News.\n\nEight years after Hughes launched his public attack, a small newspaper, The Evening Guide in Port Hope, Ont., printed an editorial accusing Currie of wasting lives at Mons.\n\nThe remarks made by Hughes were covered by Parliamentary privilege; the editorial wasn't. The former general sued the newspaper and the resulting libel trial became front-page news across the country throughout 1927.\n\nCurrie's wartime decisions, conduct and reputation were dredged up. Cook said many aspects of the war were put on trial.\n\n\"I suppose it was fair to ask the questions,\" said Vance. \"It's easy to sit and judge what went on then. The country was tired. The country lost nearly a generation of young men and women.\"\n\nCurrie's fate, Vance said, shows how the political and public expectations surrounding the conduct of the war in 1918 were scarcely different from those prevailing today.\n\nCanadian soldiers carry the flag-draped casket of Master-Cpl.

You don't want to take any casualties but sometimes you end up having to do it,\" he said.\n\n\"This is the challenge whenever [you're] trying to achieve political objectives with military force. There needs to be a very honest dialogue between all levels responsible for the committal of troops, so it's clearly understood what's at stake and what you are risking.\"\n\nCurrie ended up winning his libel case and was awarded a settlement of just $500 by the judge. His reputation was affirmed, but his health was ruined. He suffered a stroke in 1928 and died in 1933.\n\n\"Sir Arthur Currie is our finest battlefield general, in my opinion,\" said Cook, the country's leading Great War historian and author.\n\n\"I think Sir Arthur Currie has been largely forgotten by Canadians. He is in our history books and you can find him if you want to, but he isn't a household name. Some have said that if he was an American general or a British general he would be known worldwide, as Patton is, as Montgomery is.\"\n\nAs Canadians look back during these anniversary celebrations, Cook said, they tend to focus on the symbols of sacrifice \u2014 the poppies, the John McCrae poem In Flanders Fields \u2014 without recognizing how the experience itself changed Canada.\n\n\"The First World War is not just a nation-building event.

Now the Bombers are heading to Calgary for the West final and look like a team on a mission after defeating the Saskatchewan Roughriders 23-18 in the Western semifinal.\n\nIt was the Bombers first playoff win since 2011 when they beat Hamilton in the East final. Winnipeg also hadn't defeated Saskatchewan in the playoffs since 1965.\n\nTo say there was a high level of concern in Rider Nation in the hours leading up to the playoff game was an understatement.\n\nNews broke late Saturday night the team's starting quarterback Zach Collaros wouldn't even be suiting up for the game after suffering a hellacious hit to the head in the team's last regular season game in late October.\n\nBlue Bombers prevail in West semifinal:\n\nThe Winnipeg Blue Bombers hung on to slay the Saskatchewan Roughriders 23-18 in the West Division semifinal. 2:16\n\nThat meant the hopes and dreams of Rider fans were pinned squarely on the shoulders of Canadian backup quarterback Brandon Bridge. A year previous, Bridge was used effectively, swapping in and out of games with Kevin Glenn throughout the season and nearly leading the team to a Grey Cup appearance before losing in the East final.\n\nBut this season was different.\n\nBridge seemed unsure at times and unable to find open receivers when he came into games for Collaros. That's also how Bridge looked for much of the Western semifinal against the Bombers on Sunday afternoon.\n\n13th-man curse\n\nHigh above the new Mosaic Stadium in Regina, there's a banner the team unfurls at the beginning of every game \u2014 a 13th-Man flag. A salute to the raucous fan base of the Roughriders.\n\nSo perhaps it was a sign of things to come at the beginning of Sunday's game when they tried to unveil the flag, but it didn't unfurl. It got tangled and stuck. A misfire of sorts.\n\nThe Roughriders offence led by Bridge couldn't find their rhythm. There were flickers. Bridge did his best to run for his life at times and was successful on a few occasions. He finished the game rushing for 86 yards. But when the team needed a big second down conversion, Bridge was unable to find open receivers.\n\nDespite that, the game was still hanging in the balance heading to the fourth quarter.\n\nWinnipeg held a narrow 13-12 lead with just 15 minutes left in a game that showcased two solid defences. It was cold. Windy. Elements were certainly in the way of both offences' ability to execute.\n\nWith the snow and wind swirling midway through the final frame, it was Canadian running back Andrew Harris who stole the show and took over the game.\n\nWith the score 16-12 for the Bombers with six minutes left to play, Winnipeg's Most Outstanding Canadian ran wild. He galloped down the field with runs of 37 yards, 14 yards and then finally capped a 53-yard scoring drive by plunging into the end zone.\n\nHarris single-handedly took over the game and gave the Bombers an 11-point lead with time winding down. He finished the game with 19 carries for 153 yards rushing.\n\nRoughriders last minute gasp\n\nThe Roughriders didn't quit. On the ensuing kickoff after the Bombers touchdown which seemingly put the game out of reach, Loucheiz Purifoy returned the football into Winnipeg territory. Not long after that Nick Marshall ran into the end zone for the Roughriders. The two-point convert failed, making the score 23-18 with just over two minutes left.\n\nBut Harris's powerful running continued when the Bombers got the ball back. He salted away more than a minute of valuable time for the Roughriders who were trying to mount a last-minute miracle.\n\nThe team in green did get the ball back with about 40 seconds remaining in the game, but it was too little too late.\n\nThere was outrage as the seconds ticked down with the Roughriders trying to drive for the winning points. Bridge took a wicked hit to the head that went uncalled and forced him to leave the game with just eight seconds remaining. The crowd was furious and booed their displeasure as Bridge laid in a crumpled heap on the field.\n\nThat meant third-string quarterback David Watford would have to come into the game for the Roughriders for one last Hail Mary pass. It was intercepted by the Bombers to secure the victory.\n\nFollowing the game, the CFL released a statement saying the hit on Bridge \"was clearly a missed call\" and that a solution is needed to get calls right, especially when player health and safety is involved.\n\nA statement from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CFL</a> Commissioner Randy Ambrosie: <a href=\"https://t.co/YIwhEnrfET\">pic.twitter.com/YIwhEnrfET</a> \u2014@CFLFootballOps\n\nCould this be Winnipeg's year?\n\nThe surging Blue Bombers now get set to travel to McMahon Stadium in Calgary to take on the Stampeders in the West final next Sunday.\n\nWinnipeg has won six out of the last seven games and seem to be playing with a high level of confidence. The last time the Bombers and Stamps met in the playoffs was during the 2001 Grey Cup game, which Calgary won.\n\nIt has been a long Grey Cup drought for Winnipeg. The team last won the championship in 1990. They've played in three Grey Cup games over that time, losing every time.\n\nBut this is a different team with a different swagger. They showed it off in the snow Sunday night in Saskatchewan.", "Duke got something from Army that it didn't against Kentucky: A test.\n\nThe fourth-ranked Blue Devils pulled away to beat the Black Knights 94-72 on Sunday behind 27 points and 16 rebounds from Zion Williamson.\n\nPlaying five days after routing the second-ranked Wildcats in the Champions Classic , they shot 49 per cent but couldn't shake the Black Knights until the final 10 minutes, finally pulling away with an 11-0 run keyed by three-pointers from fellow freshmen R.J. Barrett and Cameron Reddish.\n\n\"It's one thing for somebody to tell you that everybody's going to bring their best against you, that all their shots are going to feel like they're going in,\" Williamson said. \"But I think until you truly experience it, I think you just have to go through it to fully understand.\"\n\nReddish finished with 25 points and Barrett had 23 while Williamson added six blocked shots and four assists for the Blue Devils (2-0).\n\nCoach Mike Krzyzewski called it \"a perfect game for us following Kentucky\" and said his team's preparation wasn't as at a high enough level beforehand.\n\n\"That whole thing, the hangover of success and travel and then getting ready\" for a game, Krzyzewski said. \"The only way you do it is to do it. And our guys don't feel good about themselves right now. And that's good.

Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations have been trying to broker a long-term ceasefire.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million US in aid to Gaza's cash-strapped Hamas rulers. Hamas responded by lowering the intensity of the border protest last Friday.\n\nWhile the fighting eased early on Monday, and the sides appeared to show restraint, the fate of the progress toward a truce remained uncertain. It was not clear what exactly touched off Sunday's fighting.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu defended his decision to allow through the Qatari cash to Gaza as a way to avert an \"unnecessary war,\" maintain quiet for residents of southern Israel and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the impoverished Gaza Strip.", "The Florida Panthers are spreading the scoring around.\n\nAleksander Barkov scored twice during Florida's five-goal second period and the Panthers beat the Ottawa Senators 5-1 on Sunday night for their fourth straight win.\n\nJonathan Huberdeau had a goal and an assist, and Frank Vatrano and Troy Brouwer also scored.

That includes the use of the term ombudsman.\n\nNational dispute resolution services (OBSI and ADR Chambers) would have to publish on their website a summary of their final recommendations and the reasons for them.\n\nThe proposed legislation doesn't include a plan for one independent dispute resolution service.\n\n\"We expect all approved external complaint bodies to maintain a strong reputation for being operated in a manner consistent with the standards of good character and integrity, and to ensure that complaints are addressed in an impartial and independent manner,\" Pierre-Olivier Herbert, press secretary for Bill Morneau, wrote in an email to Go Public.\n\nMoved money to credit union\n\nMcMillan says the OBSI investigation is now over and she's waiting to receive a financial settlement from the bank.\n\nShe's now moved all of her family's money out of CIBC to a credit union.

Since last year, Clover has been by his side almost every waking moment of every day to help Salway cope.\n\n\"It was about 2012, 2013 when I was diagnosed with PTSD and I wasn't really sure what treatment I wanted to go for,\" Salway told CBC Radio's Saskatchewan Weekend. \"Through the network that I had, I had started seeing people get service dogs.\"\n\nAfter listening to one of his peers experiences with a service dog, he figured he needed a teammate who would always be there for him.\n\nMy confidence level started coming back. - Jody Salway\n\nSalway was just starting school at the University of Regina, which he said was adding to his anxiety. Once his service dog Clover came into the mix during his first semester at school he noticed everything in his life start on an upswing.\n\n\"Having her there all the time and her doing her job, I started getting more sleep, my confidence level started coming back, she became what we coined, 'social lubricant,'\" Salway said.\n\nSalway said before he had Clover around he would feel uncomfortable having conversations with people because of the anxiety he would experience.\n\nNow, those same conversations have switched from being about him to conversations about Clover which makes it easier for him to have discussions with people.\n\n'I'm going to get through this'; meeting Clover\n\nOnce Salway decided he wanted a service dog he set out to find an animal which would be best suited to his unique needs.\n\nHe said the breeder he contacted had German Shepherds or English Mastiffs to choose from, with each breed being better suited to different scenarios.\n\nAs Salway didn't have issues getting out of his house or remaining active, the Mastiff was a better choice.\n\nHe said he felt as though he might become a 'walking billboard' once he obtained a service dog, because not many people knew he was battling PTSD. Once he met Clover, his mentality changed.\n\n\"I was looking at her, and she was looking and me, and I thought 'you know, I'm going to get through this,' and she looked at me and I think she had this look in her eyes that was like 'I've got a lot of work to do,'\" Salway said.\n\nA living barometer\n\nSalway said Clover is now a 'living barometer' for how he is doing mentally.\n\n\"I can look at her, and when she's doing something that doesn't seem right, I can always stop and pause [and ask] 'what am I doing right now, what doesn't feel right, what am I doing to make her do what she's doing, what is she reacting to?'\" Salway said. \"Ultimately, then [I think] 'you know what? I am a little bit anxious and here's why.'\"\n\nGiving himself that second to reflect on what's going on helps Salway address the anxiety he may be feeling\u2014\u200bwhich helps it go away.\n\nWork is something Clover loves according to Salway. While she's wearing her service dog vest she's doing what she does best\u2014 but even when the vest comes off, she's always watching Salway's back.\n\n\"What she's trained to do, is always be watching the void, whatever I can't see, she watches,\" Salway said. \"We call that keeping six. Sometimes I'll be washing dishes and I feel her come up and sit between my ankles to make sure nothing surprises me.\"\n\nBecoming a team\n\nSalway said after nearly two years with Clover by his side the two are inseparable.\n\n\"I might leave her at home for certain things once in awhile but it's so rare, she comes everywhere with me,\" Salway said. \"It's nice that I can always just reach down, and there she is.\"\u200b\u200b\n\nSalway said Clover is trained to check in on him by bumping him every so often to make sure he's doing okay.\n\nBeyond small gestures, Clover also helps Salway by literally pulling him out of situations that might just be too much for him to handle.\n\nClover has helped Salway cope with night terrors he experienced since he returned from Afghanistan. He said she would wake him up by licking his face until he was conscious. At his worst, Salway said he was sleeping just four hours a night.\n\n\"That was tough, because the body can't sustain that and I had been doing it for years,\" Salway said. \"When she came in and she started interrupting the sleep cycle from the nightmares, well, my four hour cycle went up to six and that two hours was really noticeable.\"\n\nSalway now is sleeping between seven-and-a-half to eight hours every night, which has provided clarity in his thinking patterns and helped diminish the anxiety he feels on a regular basis.\n\nThe extra sleep is also allowing his body to repair the damage in his brain.\n\nWith files from CBC Radio's Saskatchewan Weekend", "Local Mexican officials were once again Sunday helping thousands of Central American migrants find rides on the next leg of their journey toward the U.S. border.\n\nAt a toll plaza to the west of the central Mexico city of Queretaro, where the group spent Saturday night, police helped find trucks to take migrants and prevented them from trying to stop drivers themselves.\n\nThe government of Queretaro said via Twitter that 6,531 migrants had moved through the state between Friday and Saturday. It said that 5,771 of those were departing Sunday morning after staying in three shelters it had prepared, the largest of which was a soccer stadium in the state capital.\n\nThose numbers appeared even higher than counts made by officials when the group was in Mexico City for several days, raising the possibility that other migrants have caught up to the main caravan.\n\nThe migrants began walking before dawn Sunday for Irapuato about 100 kilometres to the west after crossing into Guanajuato state, where local authorities also assisted them.\n\nA day earlier a similar scene played out as the caravan exited Mexico City. Dedicated metro trains moved migrants across the capital before dawn and at a toll plaza north of the city they formed orderly lines to wait for their turn to climb aboard passing 18-wheelers that were willing to help them cover the 200 kilometres to Queretaro.\n\n'Something to live on'\n\nEmilson Manuel Figueroa managed a seat on the back of a flatbed truck packed with other migrants.\n\n\"I think that in my country I will get old and will never have something to live on,\" said the 23-year-old cab driver from Honduras.\n\nThe migrants appear to be on a path to Tijuana across the border from San Diego, which is still some 2,575 kilometres away.\n\nCentral American migrants get a ride on trucks, in Celaya, Mexico, on Sunday.

Surrey is expected to surpass Vancouver in population as the largest city in B.C. by 2041.\n\nWith that growth, Sandhu, a longtime Surrey resident, said he's concerned about gun violence involving youth, even as the RCMP says overall crime is on the decline.\n\nWhen two teenagers were found dead on a rural road in what police called a targeted shooting in June, Sandhu said many in the city felt the same way: \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nSixteen-year-old Jaskarn Singh Jhutty and 17-year-old Jaskaran Singh Bhangal, both residents of Surrey, were shot dead in June.

Abbotsford, B.C., dropped the Mounties in 1995, when it amalgamated with Matsqui and formed the Abbotsford Police Department, and a small town in Prince Edward Island made the move in the early 1990s.\n\nA daunting and costly task: expert\n\nRob Gordon, a criminology professor with Simon Fraser University, said it's a daunting and costly task. While it typically comes with the benefit of lighter caseloads for local officers, it means immediately losing a 10 per cent subsidy that the federal government offers any municipality that uses the RCMP.\n\n\"There will be a lot of eyes on Surrey to see whether or not it is cost effective to do this,\" Gordon said.\n\nMayor Doug McCallum has defended the expense, which he said voters condoned when they filled all but one council seat with members of the Safe Surrey party, which ran on making the change.\n\n\"A local police force will understand the community better and will be more motivated to tackle problems,\" his campaign platform said.\n\n'Ownership and control'\n\nMcCallum has said he believes the switch to municipal policing can be accomplished within the next two years at a cost of about $120 million.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, who is in charge of the Surrey RCMP detachment, has already said his officers will remain on the job throughout any changes.\n\nIt is such a unique community and we have unique needs. RCMP Cpl. Elenore Sturko\n\nYvon Danduran, professor emeritus of criminology at the University of the Fraser Valley, said one benefit of a municipal police force is the perception of governance. The RCMP gets its direction from Ottawa, while a police board oversees a local force and the city holds the purse strings.\n\n\"It's really about ownership and control,\" Danduran said. \"If you have your own police force, you live with it, you improve it and you try to be proud of it.\"\n\nOverall crime on the decline: RCMP\n\nThe RCMP says statistics in Surrey don't back up the alarm. Overall crime has declined in the past decade in all areas, including violent offences and property crimes.\n\nCpl. Elenore Sturko said publicity around some high-profile cases, such as the hockey dad who was gunned down in front of his home in a case of mistaken identity in July, may be skewing perceptions of crime in the city.\n\n\"People, especially externally, have a perception of Surrey as being a dangerous place or having a real crime problem that's not necessarily supported by what we see statistically,\" Sturko said.\n\nShootings have declined by about half since a spike in 2015, when there were 59 instances of shots fired in the municipality, she said.\n\nHomicides remain relatively steady, with a local rate of 2.15 per 100,000 population in 2017, above the national average of 1.8. There have been 13 homicides so far this year, compared with 12 in 2017, eight in 2016 and nine in 2015.\n\nUnique needs\n\nMounties have also increased enforcement in several areas, Sturko said, including boosting staff on its gang enforcement unit. It has prevention programs specifically targeting at-risk youth and other education and community engagement initiatives like a diversity unit, she said.\n\n\"It is such a unique community and we have unique needs, but we also have unique programs,\" she said.\n\n\"That doesn't necessarily mean people's concerns are alleviated. That comes with more work in sharing, for example, the success that we are having and letting the public know what kind of headway we're making and what's happening,\" Sturko said.\n\nSandhu said he is skeptical that changing the police force alone will answer a problem that requires more grassroots change. The solution has to come from the community itself, he said.\n\n\"The current situation in the City of Surrey should be a red flag for all political leaders that when you neglect the demographics or uniqueness of a city and try to do a one-size fits all school district, a one-size fits all policing model, you are going to get to this stage.\"", "A pioneer of the Stratford Festival, Douglas Rain, died Sunday at the age of 90 in a hospital just outside the city in which he first established his longtime classical career.\n\nRain spent 32 seasons acting at Stratford and was one of the few surviving founding members of the company.

The letter was not shown to Dick.\n\nChartier said she felt it would be inappropriate to contact her fellow student considering Dick had retained legal counsel.

Lions (9-9) on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET after dropping its final three regular-season contests. While hardly ideal, the Ticats still finished second in East standings to secure home field for the conference semifinal.\n\nAnd in the last two seasons, both Ottawa (8-9-1) and Toronto (9-9-0) went on to capture the Grey Cup after posting mediocre regular-season records. But that's of little solace to Ticats head coach June Jones.\n\n\"Our goal was to just get here \u2026 and then to the Grey Cup,\" he said. \"That's all I'm thinking about, that's all the kids are thinking about.\n\n\"If you win in November, you win it all.\"\n\nBig loss\n\nTrouble is, Hamilton hasn't done a lot of winning this season at Tim Hortons Field.

Yet Banks had become a trusted target for Masoli and had two TD strikes in the lopsided home win over the Lions.\n\nHowever, something both teams could have to contend with is Mother Nature. It's been a cool, windy and wet week in Hamilton and Sunday's forecast calls for a high of 3 C with 15 km/h winds and a 40 per cent chance of snow.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that could be more of an issue for B.C., which plays its home games in a dome.

But the five-foot-eight, 213-pound Sutton's physical running style is made for a cold-weather playoff game.\n\nWho's not\n\nHamilton at home. The Ticats were 4-5 this year at Tim Hortons Field, the lowest home winning percentage of any CFL playoff team this season. And the club ended the regular campaign with three straight losses.

Western Canada's oil companies are now in the same boat thanks to production gains that have not been matched by export pipeline capacity gains.\n\nLike those farmers, oil producers have filled storage to bursting while they wait for a solution to appear. The price discounts or \"differentials\" that had mainly affected heavy oil have spread to light oil and upgraded synthetic oilsands crude as pipeline space tightens.\n\nEstimates on the cost to the economy vary wildly, but the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers officially estimates the impact as at least C$13 billion in the first 10 months of 2018.\n\n$50 million cost per day\n\nIt estimates the cost at about $50 million Cdn per day in October as discounts for Western Canadian Select bitumen-blend crude oil versus New York-traded West Texas Intermediate peaked at more than $52 US per barrel.\n\n\"The differential has blown out to such an extreme level for two reasons, the lack of access to markets and the fact we really have only one customer (the United States),\" said Tim McMillan, CEO of CAPP.\n\nGetting an exact number on how much discounts are costing Canada is all but impossible thanks to ingrained sector secrecy about transportation and marketing, he said, adding it's entirely possible the real costs could be as high as $100 billion per year.\n\nWe're losing hundreds of millions of dollars that's going to subsidize drivers in the United States. -Tim McMillan , CEO of CAPP\n\nProducers' exposure to WCS prices differ depending on what kind of oil they produce, where they sell it and how they transport it.\n\nCalgary-based Imperial Oil Ltd., for instance, says about one-quarter of its output of 300,000 barrels of bitumen per day is influenced by WCS pricing \u2014 the rest is used in its Canadian refineries or shipped by pipe or rail to the U.S. Gulf Coast where it gets close to WTI prices.\n\nThe company announced last week it will build a 75,000-bpd oilsands project, going on faith that pipelines will be in place for when production begins in about four years (a prospect that took a hit Thursday when a U.S. judge put TransCanada Corp.'s Keystone XL pipeline on hold until more environmental study is done).\n\nMeanwhile, it is ramping up rail shipments from its co-owned Edmonton terminal as fast as it can.\n\nOther oilsands producers including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Cenovus Energy Inc. are cutting production to avoid selling at current prices.\n\nThe industry's problems receive little sympathy from environmentalists like Keith Stewart of Greenpeace.\n\n\"The root of the problem is that companies kept expanding production even when they knew there was no new transport,\" he said.\n\nBut McMillan pointed out it takes years to plan, win regulatory approval and build projects.\n\nFor example, producers would have had no way of knowing ahead of time that the 525,000-barrel-per-day Northern Gateway pipeline project approved in 2014 by a Conservative government would then be rejected by a Liberal government in 2016, he said.\n\n\"If Northern Gateway had come on as planned, we wouldn't be in this situation,\" said McMillan.\n\nIn a report last February, Scotiabank analysts estimated the differential would shave $15.6 billion Cdn in revenue annually, with a quick ramp up in crude-by-rail expected to shrink the hit to $10.8 billion Cdn by the fall.\n\nAt that time, discounts had widened to about $30 US per barrel from an average of around $13 US in the previous two years.\n\nA depot used to store pipes for the planned Keystone XL pipeline is seen in Gascoyne, North Dakota, in 2017.

Producers exposed to WCS didn't get the benefit of the higher U.S. oil prices.\n\nMcMillan said the differentials are being noticed by potential energy investors \u2014 CAPP expects capital investment of $42 billion in the Canadian oilpatch in 2018, down from $81 billion in 2014.\n\n\"We're losing hundreds of millions of dollars that's going to subsidize drivers in the United States.\"", "A group of volunteers planted thousands of handmade poppies at the graves of veterans at Vancouver's Mountain View cemetery on Saturday to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the end of the First World War.\n\n\"It's all about remembrance and veterans,\" said Guy Black, the organizer of the event. \"It's a commemoration of the end of the war when peace was finally achieved and the sacrifice that soldiers and families made for someone else's freedom and peace.\"\n\nThe ceremony brought together hundreds of veterans, community members, local politicians and European dignitaries.

Alex Laporte sat down with Loren McGinnis, host of The Trailbreaker, to explain in detail what led to the decision to place the victim of a sexual assault in a jail cell on the night of the attack. 9:17\n\nQuestions linger in the aftermath of the sentencing of a 25-year-old Kugluktuk man for a sexual assault in Yellowknife in May 2017. The victim had been placed in a jail cell following the attack, and N.W.T. Judge Garth Malakoe criticized RCMP for their response in his written ruling earlier this year.\n\n\"I am unable to imagine circumstances which would justify this type of treatment of a victim of sexual assault,\" wrote Malakoe. \"It appears the victim was not treated with the dignity and compassion that she or any victim of a sexual assault deserves.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Yellowknife RCMP detachment commander Insp. Alex Laporte sat down with Loren McGinnis, host of The Trailbreaker, to explain in detail what led to that decision, what's changed since then, and how RCMP plan to work to ensure a similar event does not happen in the future.\n\nThe following interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nQ: Why does the RCMP believe that a cell was the best place for this woman, the night of her assault?\n\nThe court's comment on this situation, as they always are, are taken very seriously. So for us, it triggered a review of the investigation, of our response, and looking at the aspects that the officers considered when they attended the scene, and if it was in line with their training or policies.\n\nWe reviewed that file, and we reviewed the court transcripts, as well, what had been provided to the courts. And in reviewing the file, what we discovered was that they dealt with a victim that night that was under the influence, unco-operative.\n\nIt was a multi-member response. Because our aim is always to get to the scene of violence as quickly as possible. And that's what we did that night. Many officers responded, a suspect was apprehended a short distance from the scene. We had officers dealing with witnesses, officers dealing with the victim.\n\nAt the time, they're asking themselves, what can we do here? - RCMP Insp. Alex Laporte\n\nAnd in applying their assessment process, assessing if there are any injuries, if the victim expressed any injuries herself, the members were in a position where, with a few realities going on that evening, there's an ongoing investigation and there's also an aspect of caring for that person.\n\nSo the members are guided with the elements they had at the scene. At the time, they're asking themselves, what can we do here? Faced with the situation to make sure this person is cared for [and] they're not revictimized later tonight? The person doesn't want to go to the hospital at that point, we had limited options in May 2017 as far as social initiatives. We have a few shelters [in the city], they still have their rules for the safety of their clients.\n\nSo the officers decided that their best plan that night to care for that person and ensure their safety was actually to apprehend them and take them into custody in one of our cells. So they could be in a safe place, monitored, until they were in a better state for one of us to offer services \u2014 the hospital, victim services, aspects of the investigation that we wanted to cover to hold the assailant accountable.\n\nQ: Does the RCMP believe this is the best option for someone who has been a victim of a sexual assault?\n\nI've said it, I'm going to say it again. We do not want to put victims of crime in cells.\n\nActually, if we go back a few years ago, we \u2014 the RCMP in this detachment \u2014 have been a catalyst in identifying that we could not continue to do things the same way we were doing them with our vulnerable population. Where we actually started to consider more avenues for people, and asking the community at large to consider more avenues. So it's been our positioning for many years to not put people in cells when they don't deserve to be in cells.\n\nSo let me be clear on this one: we don't want to put victims of crime, any type of crime, in cells when they don't deserve to be in cells. But I'm unable to say it won't happen again, considering all the avenues we have.\n\nBecause we're asking officers now to consider all those options. The sobering centre, the outreach vehicle \u2014 these people, those workers, have developed such relationships with our vulnerable population, that it's key for the community to come together and provide those services.\n\nQ: All those services you mention, and you put the case in context by saying that it was in 2017 and there have been some changes, but why was none of that available to the RCMP in that moment?\n\nWell, the social initiatives, street outreach, sobering centre, outreach services, they started in the summer of 2017, in June, July. We had some shelters.\n\nBut guided by the facts \u2014 those were experienced officers attending that scene \u2014 guided by the facts, their decision was that given the situation, it's best that we care for that person in this matter.\n\nWe work with the shelters, we work with the different groups. I'm proud of the relationship that we have with organizations in providing services and coming together in partnership. Because at the end of the day, I think we all have the intent and the desire to bring the services to those people.\n\nFor the police, we have a role to play, and in situations like this, first of all, its to get to that violent situation as quick as possible, and make sure that situation is safe. But then there's a prevention aspect, and there's an aftercare aspect as well.\n\nI find that hear in Yellowknife, particularly right now, given all the services that we have, the committed people and dedicated people that we have, and the different levels of leadership that have stepped up, we are in a better position to provide those services.\n\nQ: If the same scenario unfolded tonight, what would be different?\n\nAs we have communicated to our members and as we see it, we ask our members to consider all avenues. A police cell is a last resort. Bottom line.\n\nWe have shelters, we have a sobering centre, we have workers out at all hours of the day and night that can assist us in assessing situations, in diffusing and engaging, and communicating with people. We have the hospital, we maintain a great relationship with Stanton. And our officers are asked to consider all avenues, having in mind that a cell is a last resort.", "The union for B.C. grocery store employees is accusing a Vancouver worker of unlawfully breaching a membership database in a campaign to spread \"hatred, ridicule and contempt\" of the leadership.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 1518 (UFCW) filed a lawsuit in B.C.

(John Marten)\n\nMarten, whose maiden name is Turpin, joined the war effort in 1943 when she was just 16.\n\nHer family lived in relative poverty in Toronto after the Great Depression years. The war had been raging for four years by the time she finished grade school and there was a dual expectation that the teenager would earn a wage to help the family and contribute to the war effort.\n\n\"I tell my grandchildren and they can't believe it in this day and age, but I had a hole in my shoe and every morning a piece of cardboard would go into my shoe so I wasn't walking on the ground,\" said Marten. \"Once the war came everybody was getting different jobs in different places.\"\n\nDuring the Second World War, Marion Turpin worked as an electrician building Mosquito bombers. 2:04\n\nMarten first took a job making pressure castings for bombs. The wage was meagre, only 25-cents an hour. Coupled with the endless work-days, Marten was miserable.\n\nShe eventually worked up the courage to ask for a raise, and in the end that conversation led to an opportunity she never imagined.\n\n\"My boss said 'I got you a raise, Marion. Half a cent an hour,' And I said 'well then you can take my notice.' And that's when I decided to go to de Havilland,\" Marten said.\n\nIn the Second World War, de Havilland Canada was the major Canadian player in warplanes. Established in 1928, it operated out of a plant with an airstrip near downtown Toronto when World War II erupted.\n\n\"I went to de Havilland and I couldn't believe we started at 75 cents an hour. That was very good money in those days,\" said Marten.\n\nFlight of the Mosquito\n\nShe immediately started training to be an electrician, which she said is lucky because she's always been a handy person.\n\n\"I wasn't an electrician to wire a house or anything, but\u2026 an electrician on the mosquito bomber,\" she said.\n\nAfter a month learning the ins and outs of her craft, Marten was entrusted to do all of the wiring on the planes as they came down the assembly line.\n\n\"Part of the wires were installed prefabricated when they were doing the wings and different parts, but they left all the wires free. I had to join them up,\" she said.\n\n\"Today you join them up, twist them and put a cap on them. But back then you had to solder every joint. So it was the soldering iron, the solder and the screwdriver to hold the joints together while you were soldering.\"\n\nMarion Marten stands next to the wheel well of a Mosquito Bomber at the Alberta Aviation Museum. (Tanara McLean/CBC News)\n\nPerfection on the production line was the expectation and Marten held a high standard for her work.\n\n\"You must do a good job because you know the pilots are depending on you that the job is well done,\" she said. \"We knew from the beginning that it was important [work].\"\n\nAlthough Marten worked in the relative safety of Canada during the war, she had her own near death experiences while contributing to the war effort.\n\nHer petite frame meant she could get into small places to do wiring, including up in the wheel wells.\n\nYou must do a good job because the pilot is depending on you. - Marion Marten\n\n\"I was up there working and somebody went into the cockpit and started fooling around with the gears,\" said Marten.\n\n\"The wheel makes a funny noise just before it was to go up and I knew the noise.

Well I fell down to the ground and the doors closed. I would have been cut in half, but thank god I made it. I was young, and when you're young you can move fast,\" she said.\n\nDespite the near misses, Marten's time working on the Mosquito bombers was a highlight in her life.\n\n\"I'd go back tomorrow,\" she said. \"It was just a lovely place to work.\"\n\n\"There were only three women in that great big bay.

We had different shifts, different drivers picking us up. Very seldom we'd see each other.\"\n\nWhen the war ended, Marten, like many others earning a war effort wage, had mixed feelings.\n\nOn one hand, their loved ones overseas could come home if they didn't perish but on the other hand, war-time jobs dried up and they had to find new ways to make ends meet.\n\nMarten eventually got married to a service police officer who served overseas.\n\nEventually the pair settled in Vancouver where they raised two children, including their son Jim Marten.\n\nHe grew up hearing stories about his mom's time wiring Mosquito bombers, and it filled him with pride.\n\n\"I was pretty proud of my mom as a young kid knowing my mom was an electrician. How many women do you hear of that are electricians back in my day when I was eight or nine years old,\" he said.\n\nAll these years later, Marion Marten is proud of her work too.\n\n\"My time wasn't wasted,\" she said. \"You felt you were doing something to help the war effort, and everybody was trying to do just that.

The group meets every Thursday evening at the Unifor building in downtown Fort McMurray.\n\n\"I decided to take my experience and put it out in the world,\" Gorman said. \"So others know they weren't the only ones dealing with this kind of thing.\"\n\nThe group gets support from the Fort McMurray Legion. Its president, Pat Duggan, said it can be tough to get hardened service personnel who work in an oil-town to share their struggles.\n\n\"Everyone's gotta be tough and move on,\" Duggan said. \"That kind of attitude still permeates.\"\n\nDespite seeking professional help, it wasn\u2019t until Cpl. Andrew Gorman started confiding in other service members and launched a support group that he could begin healing. 1:31\n\nFinding strength in others\n\nGorman said peer-to-peer groups like his allow attendees to breakdown their so-called macho exterior and open up.\n\nNow, Gorman said, he is the one encouraging members to do morning and evening meditation.\n\nThis Remembrance Day, Gorman urges other veterans to persevere in getting help and not to give up if the first or second counsellor didn't work out.\n\nAnd don't forget to lean on each other, he said.\n\n\"The biggest thing I want to get out is that you are not alone. There's tons of people who have gone through similar experiences,\" Gorman said. \"There's no shame in anything that you are feeling.\"\n\nGorman said veterans or first responders who need help should reach out to their local Legion or get in contact with him through the Project Trauma Support website.\n\nConnect with David Thurton, CBC's Fort McMurray correspondent, on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or email him at david.thurton@cbc.ca", "REGINA \u2014 Two storied Canadian Football League franchises are ready for a playoff battle of massive proportions in the prairies on Sunday.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Roughriders host the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Western semifinal at 4:30 p.m. ET. It's the 21st post-season meeting between the two teams, with the Riders holding a narrow 11-9 series lead.\n\nIt's only getting colder in the prairies going into the game. On Friday, Regina broke a century-old record with the temperature dropping to -24.9 C. The previous record of -23.9 was set in 1919.\n\nThe wind has swirled on the flatlands all weekend. The snow has left the turf at Mosaic Stadium slippery and slick. It's the type of weather you'd expect when the Riders and Bombers meet in a playoff game in November.\n\nAt kickoff, the temperature is expected to be hovering around -10 without the windchill. Turnovers could be a big part of the game.\n\nCollaros a late scratch\n\nIt was announced just before game time on Sunday that Roughriders quarterback Zach Collaros has been scratched.\n\nCanadian Brandon Bridge will get the start at QB and be backed up by David Watford and Drew Tate.\n\nCollaros' health had been questioned after a hellacious hit in the team's final game against B.C. Collaros was forced to leave the game after a blow to the head from Odell Willis.\n\nWhen Collaros was asked previously about whether or not he would be starting, he took the game-playing one step further, saying he wasn't even sure if he'd dress for the game.\n\nThen, late Saturday night, there were reports indicating Bridge would get the start for the Roughriders and Collaros wouldn't even be in uniform. It's the type of stuff you'd expect in the playoffs.\n\nREPORT: According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TSNDaveNaylor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TSNDaveNaylor</a>, Zach Collaros will not play tomorrow; Brandon Bridge to start.<br><br>FOR MORE | <a href=\"https://t.co/G2lju5Ap3r\">https://t.co/G2lju5Ap3r</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GCPlayoffs?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GCPlayoffs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Riders?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Riders</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hVqcsys8y5\">pic.twitter.com/hVqcsys8y5</a> \u2014@CFL\n\nHome-field advantage\n\nThe crazed green-clad Roughriders fans haven't watched their team at home in the playoffs since their magical Grey Cup run in 2013. Today's playoff game is the first in the new Mosaic Stadium.\n\nStill, expect there to be a wave of blue and gold in the stands; Bombers fans are wild about their team and travel well. Winnipeg finished 5-1 down the stretch. The Manitoba team hasn't captured the Grey Cup since 1990 \u2014 the longest drought in the CFL.\n\nThe Winnipeg Blue Bombers humiliated the Saskatchewan Roughriders 31-0. It's Winnipeg's first shutout victory since their 29-0 win over Hamilton on July 28, 2006. 1:16\n\nMosaic Stadium is one of the most hostile places to play in the CFL, making it difficult for opposing teams to operate on offence. This season, the Riders finished with a 6-3 record in the friendly confines of Mosaic. The Bombers were 4-5 on the road, including a Labour Day Classic loss in Regina at the beginning of September.\n\nThis is only the third time ever the Roughriders are hosting the Bombers in the conference semifinal \u2014 the last time was in 1975 when Saskatchewan won 42-24. The only other time before that was in 1971, which the Roughriders also won.\n\nPerhaps the biggest key to Sunday's playoff game will be special teams and the turnover battle. When the Roughriders win this season, they score on defence and star on special teams. This year, the Roughriders tied a CFL record with 15 kick return touchdowns. They also scored 11 touchdowns on defence this season \u2014 also a CFL record.\n\nThe Riders intercepted Bomber quarterbacks Matt Nichols and Chris Streveler eight times in 2018. From those eight interceptions, Saskatchewan created 30 of their 63 points in the three-game season series. In eight games in 2018, the Riders' defensive unit had as many or more touchdowns than their offence.\n\nNichols confident\n\nBut don't underestimate the Bombers' ability to get the job done on defence either.\n\nIn their 31-0 thumping of the Roughriders \u2014 their final meeting of the year \u2014 Winnipeg was all over the football, forcing a number of interceptions. They scored 151 points off turnovers this year.\n\nDefence was the story in the 2018 Banjo Bowl, with both team\u2019s combing for a fumble recovery and six interceptions, but Saskatchewan was able to stay poised enough to come away with the 32-27 win in Winnipeg. 2:28\n\nThen there's Nichols. He comes into the game riding a five-game winning streak as a starter. The team has a seven-game run with at least three touchdown drives and was the lone CFL club two score at least two touchdown drives in every game in 2018.\n\nFinally, how the Bombers start this game could go a long way in deciding whether or not their season stays alive. Winnipeg outscored the opposition 335-196 (+139) in the first half but were minus-8 in the second half in 2018.\n\nIn terms of big-game experience, there's not much to choose between the two teams. Winnipeg's projected starters have 68 career games; Saskatchewan's have played 72 playoff games.", "Hundreds of veterans and civilians braved an early winter chill Sunday morning to attend Montreal's main Remembrance Day ceremony at Place du Canada.\n\nBefore the procession, ceremonial wreaths were placed at the cenotaph while the Royal Canadian Legion's military band played a rendition of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and Amazing Grace.\n\nThis year's ceremony had added significance.

Now, Lights is working to take over the family enterprise.\n\nFor Norris, the change came when her family realized her daily grind was getting to her.\n\nShe was working at a nine-to-five desk job, commuting to St. John's every day. She says it was taking a toll on her family, and they saw it before she did.\n\n\"One day, I was just sitting at my desk at work and my father called me and he offered me to go fishing with him.\"\n\nIt wasn't long after that, she traded in her business casual clothes for oil skins.\n\n\"I started out as sewing crab jackets for the pots and cutting the ropes.

They were among many women in attendance, which they say shows the changing attitudes \u2014 including their own \u2014 in the industry.\n\n\"I actually wasn't allowed to go fishing with my dad,\" said Lights.\n\n\"I didn't believe it at first but when I did my first fleet crab season \u2026 after I was like, 'Yeah, 16-year-old me would not survive out here.'\"\n\nNorris was one of three children in the family and assumed her brother would be the one taking over the family business.\n\n\"I was afraid I wasn't able to do any of the work.

So that day when my dad was like, 'Do you want a career change?' it took me by surprise.\"\n\nNew respect for the family business\n\nThey both say they've gained a lot of respect for the hard work their fathers did over the years now that they're doing it themselves.\n\n\"I have a whole new appreciation now for what my father has done his whole life and what he's worked for,\" said Norris.\n\nBoth women know it's hard work, but they're willing take the risk for their families. And they hope others like them are encouraged to become fish harvesters too.\n\n\"Without the young people getting involved, is there a future for the fishery?

I had a son who was killed over there, but at least others will come back. They didn't fight in vain.\"\n\nIt wasn't until past 1 p.m. that the tail end of the procession arrived at La Fontaine Park.\n\nLe Canada, a Montreal newspaper that closed in the 1950s, called it \"the best parade that has ever graced the streets of the Canadian metropolis.\"", "Each piece of the regalia is carefully kept: the epaulet is held separately from the bustle, the visor apart from the fan.\n\nAnd some pieces are doubly secured: the head-roach feathers are kept in a zip-up wallet, which, in turn, is wrapped inside red cloth \u2014 a sacred colour.\n\nThese feathers form an important part of the regalia that Jerry Evans will wear to his next powwow. And just as they are securely kept, they will be securely fastened when that day comes.\n\nIt would be disastrous for one of these feathers to fall from Evans's dress onto the ground.\n\n\"I've seen dancers weep when they've dropped feathers,\" he said. \"We know how sacred this gift is, we know how sacred the eagle is, and we have to always be aware of that.\"\n\nEvans has been practising traditional Mi'kmaq dancing for decades and says he rarely misses a powwow, held each summer, in the Miawpukek First Nation. (Courtesy Jerry Evans/Facebook)\n\nEagle feathers are not a simple decoration in the Miawpukek First Nation \u2014 for traditional dancers, or for anyone else.\n\nSagamaw Mi'sel Joe, the chief of the First Nation, says as best he knows, the eagle feather has always played an enormous part of the spirituality and culture of Miawpukek.\n\n\"We've been told that the eagle itself is the only bird that ever touched the face of the creator, so eagle feathers are sacred,\" Joe said.\n\n\"In our culture, the eagle flies highest in the sky, and carries our prayers to the Creator,\" Evan continues.\n\nAnd so, if their feathers were to drop?\n\n\"Until that eagle may have died, it's probably the first time those feathers have touched the ground.\"\n\nEvans says that in his understanding of Mi'kmaq traditions in the First Nation, a dancer who has a feather fall during a dance is expected to gift that same feather to another person in the community. (Garrett Barry/CBC)\n\nEagle feathers are given as a gift, a reward for good deeds in the community.\n\nAs leader of the First Nation, Mi'sel Joe has the responsibility of giving them out. He'll often be approached for a trade: some tobacco for eagle feathers.\n\nJoe says for the most part, he'll know who is offering the deal. But on the rare occasion he's approached by a stranger, he'll do some investigating.\n\nThey're not readily passed out to just anyone, he says, but it need not take long to get one.\n\n\"If you're true to your culture, true to Mik'maq ways, and you're being respectful to yourself and people around you, respectful to people in the community, respectful to elders, you don't have to wait years and years to get a feather.\"\n\nFeathers making up Evans' bustle were all numbered and placed in the same order they grew on the eagle. Each feather is placed inside a shaft and wrapped with embroidery thread. Evans says he will sometimes use his sweat to treat the feathers.\n\nEvans still remembers the moment he learned he would be gifted eagles \u2014 and their feathers \u2014 for showing \"dedication and respect.\"\n\n\"I was gobsmacked. I didn't expect it,\" he said.\n\nHe had long wanted eagle feathers for his regalia, but wasn't sure exactly how he was going to get them. And as a newcomer to the Miawpukek First Nation, the gift from the chief himself meant a little extra: acceptance in his adopted home.\n\nEvans has been visiting and working in the First Nation for more than 30 years. First, he says, it was for his paintings and artwork, but he also gained respect in the community for his dancing, as he's done for the past twenty years.\n\n\"For me, it was my place to be. This is where I seem to have gotten acceptance, welcomed within the community.\"\n\nBefore they are blessed on the First Nation's dedicated island, but after they are received from the provincial government Chief Mi'sel Joe keeps eagles, and eagle feathers, in a freezer on his property on the First Nation. (Garrett Barry/CBC)\n\nBefore that eagle was gifted to Evans, in 2011, he says it was blessed.\n\nThe First Nation has a nearby island preserved for just that purpose.\n\n\"Every year, we take dead eagles out to the island and, through a ceremony of course, have them left there,\" said Joe.\n\nThe island is about an hour's walk away, he said, plus a boat ride over the water. No cabins or docks are allowed to be built there, except for a sweat lodge.\n\nThe eagles themselves are often brought into the community, as a result of a long-standing agreement between Miawpukek and the provincial government.\n\nJoe says you wouldn't display a feather in your home for accolades or for decoration, just as a Christian wouldn't display a Bible for that purpose. (Garrett Barry/CBC)\n\nIt started when the chief heard of eagles \u2014 sacred in his traditions \u2014 being \"discarded in the garbge dump.\"\n\nHe approached the provincial government looking to an agreement that would grant the First Nation any eagles given to their wildlife department.\n\nThe eagles brought out to the island are not buried. Instead, they are left on the land, for nature to take its course.\n\nEvans shows some of the colours that are used in his bustle. He says he used his talents as a painter and a visual artist to pick out the colours, which include red ochre. (Garrett Barry/CBC)\n\nEvans used two such eagles for his bustle, and more for other parts of his dress.\n\nIt's made of sacred parts, but it's not stuck in time. The regalia that Evans wears will change, and grow. Some parts will be swapped, some given away, sometimes whole new components will be built.\n\nFor the dancer, that just makes sense.\n\n\"I'm still growing, as is my regalia,\" he said. \"I'm still learning more about who I am, and where I'm from. And learning how to dance better, maybe.\"\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "After a shift spent digging trenches and placing barbed wire near the front lines in Vimy, France, in 1917, soldier Will R. Bird needed sleep. It was past midnight when he and two other soldiers called it a night in a bivouac dug into an embankment.\n\nA ground sheet was fastened in place to keep the soldiers warm. Hours later, the sheet broke free and touched the face of the soldier from Nova Scotia, rousing him. A warm hand grabbed one of Bird's hands, and then the other one.\n\n\"I had a look at my visitor,\" Bird wrote in his 1968 book Ghosts Have Warm Hands. \"In an instant I was out of the bivvy, so surprised I could not speak. I was face to face with my brother, Steve, who had been killed in '15!\"\n\nSteve told Will to gather his equipment and follow him. They walked through trenches and past makeshift shelters inhabited by men from Will's platoon, but when the gear on his shoulder fell off, he became separated from his brother, who had entered a passageway.\n\nBy the time Will made it to the passageway, he had two options \u2014 going left or right. He went right and his brother was nowhere to be found. Will came back and went left, but was again unsuccessful.\n\nTired, excited and sweating, Will dozed off as he leaned up against a wall that early morning.\n\nSoon after, Will was awoken by a soldier shaking him. He asked him why he was there.\n\n\"They're digging around that bivvy you were in,\" the soldier said. \"All they've found is Jim's helmet and one of Bob's legs.\"\n\nA remarkable tale of survival\n\nA German shell had landed a direct hit on where Will R.

He was rejected on a second occasion because his brother had requested that he not serve.\n\nHe also tried signing up with a battalion while working in Western Canada, but was also turned down.\n\nWhile working on a farm in Saskatchewan in 1915, Bird \"saw a vision of his brother in his uniform and then soon after received a telegram finding out he was dead,\" said Thomas Hodd, the editor of A Soldier's Place: The War Stories of Will R. Bird.\n\nThese ghostly encounters were foreshadowed by something Steve Bird once told his brother. In Will R. Bird's 1930 book And We Go On, he wrote that his brother said if he didn't come back from war, \"maybe I'll find a way to come sometime and whisper in your ear.\"\n\nUpon receiving word his brother was dead, Bird returned home to Amherst, N.S., and enlisted on April 6, 1916, at the age of 24.\n\nThe mud and barbed wire of Passchendaele, November 1917.

He saw action with the 193rd Battalion and then the 42nd Battalion, known as the Black Watch.\n\nBird's book And We Go On seems to suggest he wasn't comfortable with being a sniper. After killing three Germans in quick succession one day, Bird had open shots to kill two more, and was encouraged to do so by his sniper mate.\n\n\"A queer sensation had made me draw back,\" Bird wrote. \"I handed him the rifle. \"Go ahead yourself, if you want,\" I said, \"I've had enough of this bloody game.'\"\n\nIn explaining his actions, Bird told a sergeant he had his \"fill of such butcher work.\"\n\nBird served in campaigns in France \u2014 Amiens, Cambrai and Arras \u2014 as well as Passchendaele in Belgium, the notorious muddy 1917 battle that saw 4,000 Canadian soldiers killed and 12,000 more wounded.\n\nHe received a medal for bravery on the final day of the war, Nov. 11, 1918, for service in Mons, Belgium.\n\n\"He was in command of a section during an attack on Mons, and when the advance was held up by two enemy machine gun posts, he moved forward and brought in some heavy rifle grenade fire and forced them to withdraw,\" said Hodd.\n\nThe 42nd Battalion \u2014 of which Will R.

Along the way, he became a prolific author, writing both fiction and non-fiction books, as well as short stories.\n\nHodd said that soldiers who wrote about the First World War tended to either provide a romantic description of it, or the opposite.\n\nBird's war writings\n\n\"War for Bird seemed to meet in the middle of those two poles,\" said Hodd. \"He recognizes the realism in terms of the risks and dangers of the war.\n\n\"What he is more interested in trying to capture is the psychology of the soldier, the experience of the soldier, not just in terms of being brave or heroic, but also in terms of their fears, their concerns, their struggles.\"\n\nCook's latest book looks at the life and culture of Canadian First World War soldiers in the trenches. In researching the book, he read thousands of letters and diary entries from soldiers. He said these accounts sometimes included supernatural stories.\n\n'Lucky charms to ward off death and destruction'\n\n\"I came across other stories, spectral beings, crisis apparitions as they're sometimes called in the literature, soldiers who heard voices guiding them along, seeing their mothers beckoning them out of danger's way, everyone carrying talismans and lucky charms to ward off death and destruction,\" said Cook.\n\nWhile Bird later learned that senior officers chalked up his tale of his brother saving his life to him drinking too much rum, Bird disagreed. For starters, he said he never took rum rations.\n\n\"His warm hands had pulled me from the bivvy,\" he wrote in Ghosts Have Warm Hands. \"His voice had been perfectly natural.

Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney's military record is a case study in contradiction: despite being one of the most decorated Canadian army soldiers of the First World War, he also managed to get himself court-martialled along the way.\n\nNunney served in France as a machine gunner with the 38th Battalion, later known as the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa. He was awarded the Military Medal, the Distinguished Conduct Medal and, posthumously, the Victoria Cross for valour in several crucial battles.\n\nCalled \"Red\" by his fellow soldiers because of his hair colour, Nunney was a 13-year-old orphan when he and his brother Alfred arrived in Canada among the British Home Children.\n\nNunney was sent to live and work on a farm in Lancaster, southeast of Ottawa, and Alfred was sent to one in Renfrew, west of the capital.

Nearby, she can see people tucked behind cars, in alleyways, and even out in the open using drugs at all times of the day.\n\nWhite is one of four front-line workers at an overdose-prevention site in the Moss Park neighbourhood at the crossroads of Sherbourne Street and Dundas Street East. The temporary site is operated by a non-profit organization called Street Health, which provides nursing care and harm-reduction services from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday to Friday.\n\nEvery day she hopes to bring drug users off the streets and into safer spaces, where they can use under the supervision of both medical professionals, and support workers like herself who have been trained on the job. But unlike safe-consumption sites, which are permanent and offer a wider range of support, overdose-prevention sites across Ontario were emergency, pop-up solutions to an escalating crisis that were never meant to be long-term.\n\nIn December 2017, Health Canada announced that it would allow temporary prevention sites like Street Health's to operate across the country. The sites were given limited provincial funding for up to six months. But White says sites like hers are understaffed and under resourced given the size of the crisis they face.\n\nAs a result, the job can be stressful and demanding for those who work there. And when it comes to dealing with the mental toll of being on the front line of an opioid epidemic each day, workers like White say it feels like they've been left to help others without much help for themselves.\n\nThe reality is that it's constant loss. It's tough for this community. It's tough for the people that work here. \u2014 Kelly White\n\n\"A lot of people that talk to me about the work that I do always ask how I do it,\" said White from inside the small room where she sees clients everyday, surrounded by stockpiles of clean syringes and drawers labelled 'crack pipes.' \"Honestly, to me, the hard part is bashing your head against a system that isn't designed to help people.\"\n\nAlthough the Ontario government recently announced a new plan to replace existing overdose-prevention sites with more permanent safe-consumption sites, it's not clear that it will provide any more support for front-line workers.\n\nReality is 'constant loss'\n\nWhite was one of the four original workers at the volunteer-run Moss Park tents that popped up last summer during a spike in overdose deaths. She has seen the devastation the Toronto community has faced with the continued loss of life to unsafe drug use.\n\nSince the Street Health overdose-prevention site opened at the end of June, White said it has helped over 500 users by giving them access to a safe space and clean supplies. As the co-ordinator of the facility and one of the hands-on workers tending to clients, she's also responsible for greeting visitors, prepping tables and responding to medical emergencies.\n\nStreet Health provides sterile injection supplies, overdose prevention and intervention, nursing and other services for clients. The site has served over 500 people since it opened in June. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nWorkers like White respond to overdoses daily, and some of the losses have been personal.\n\nHolding back tears, she talks about her frustration and the difficulty of taking on an avalanche of problem that she believes requires more government intervention. Data from the federal government shows that, on average, more than 11 Canadians die because of opioids each day.\n\nIn Toronto alone, more than 300 people died of opioid overdoses in 2017, and the city has recorded 120 suspected deaths this year.\n\n\"The reality is that it's constant loss. It's tough for this community. It's tough for the people that work here,\" she said. \"But at the same time, we wouldn't want to be doing anything else.\"\n\nDonations only go so far\n\nHow do front-line workers cope with the work they do everyday? White says, \"I'd say that primarily our support comes from being united in this battle, the relationships we build with clients and each other.\"\n\nStreet Health has extended comprehensive benefits coverage to overdose-prevention site staff so that that they can get coverage for things like prescription drugs and dental care, White said.\n\nNot all front-line workers are as lucky. In lieu of more comprehensive support, a GoFundMe page was set up to support staff at other Toronto area sites. The donations can be used toward massages, counselling, and acupuncture, but donations can only go so far.\n\n\"I've lost people to overdose, and one of the hardest parts is that people are not talking about this. \u2026 We need to bring things out of the shadows,\" White said.\n\nThe Ontario government announced that it will allow 21 supervised drug-consumption facilities province-wide. The existing overdose-prevention sites will be expected to re-apply to become permanent facilities. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nShe has tried to hold daily briefings to help process what staff witness. She said some days they barely have time to debrief because the demand to meet client needs is so high.\n\n\"One of the more difficult things here is that the work is so precarious. We're only funded for six months,\" she said. Funding for Street Health's overdose-prevention site ends Nov. 30.\n\nNew model, new concerns\n\nLast month, Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott announced that it is capping supervised drug-consumption facilities at 21 sites province-wide, and will spend just over $31 million a year to fund these sites.\n\nBut how these sites will be distributed across Ontario is unknown. Also missing from the new model is any mention of support for front-line workers.\n\nThe current overdose-prevention sites will be expected to re-apply under the new provincial model to become permanent supervised-consumption sites, and White fears that will force established overdose-prevention sites like Street Health to compete for one of the limited spaces.\n\nOpen drug use is an issue in the Moss Park neighbourhood. Shortly after CBC News journalists interviewed White, they saw a man lying on the ground after what appeared to be a drug overdose. He was given CPR and taken away in an ambulance. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\n\"We are currently worried about losing the flexibility, responsiveness, lack of bureaucracy and red tape, and client-centredness that we have worked hard to maintain,\" White said.\n\nSteady funding would allow Street Health to hire more staff, and perhaps operate more than two stations for safe drug consumption. It would also allow a facility like Street Health's to be open more days \u2014 like weekends \u2014 and later at night.\n\n'It's extremely stressful' on front line\n\nOne health industry expert suggests that going a step farther and putting safe-consumption sites under the umbrella of the Canadian health-care system would alleviate some of the stress that front-line workers experience, and provide them more help.\n\nPaul-Emile Cloutier is the CEO and president of Ottawa-based HealthCareCAN, an association representing health-care providers in Canada. \u200bHe says that if front-line workers burn out, the health-care system would be there to take care of them.\n\nCloutier says the injection site in Ottawa on Murray Street receives over 45,000 patients a year and cares for about 135 people a day. He says this safe-consumption site deals with about four to five overdoses a day.\n\n\"Front-line providers always work in a crisis environment and of course it's extremely stressful,\" he said. \"We have to ensure that they are also well taken care of.\"", "In the days leading up to the Armistice that ended the Great War, Lance Cpl.Frank Teskey was almost killed twice by the relentless shelling of the retreating Germans.\n\nYou'd have never known it from the letter he wrote (in pencil) to his mother on Nov. 11, 1918.

The Allies feared the Germans would stand and fight for Mons, reducing it \u2014 like so many French communities to the west \u2014 to mud and rubble.\n\nBut on the morning of Nov. 6, the people of Mons woke to find that most of their erstwhile occupiers were gone. The Germans had staged a major evacuation overnight, leaving behind piles of paper and trash outside their offices on the Grande Place.\n\nThe book Mons 1914-1918: The Beginning and the End by British author Don Farr, recounts how the town's German commandant, in a letter, thanked the city's mayor, Jean Lecarts, \"for the intelligent and conscientious way\" he had carried out his duties, and praised ordinary citizens for their \"dignified and calm demeanour.\"\n\nA bloody retreat\n\nThe Germans fought a delaying action using a series of tough rearguard formations as 15 divisions leapfrogged over one another in retreat. They also laid on the artillery, which fired viciously and indiscriminately in the final days and hours.\n\nBilleted in a civilian house just before the ceasefire with a father, mother and teenage daughter, Teskey watched in horror as a gas shell fell into the family's backyard.\n\n\"The young girl there was overcome,\" he wrote. \"She screamed during an artillery barrage.

They lined the streets and showered soldiers with kisses and food \u2014 until the German artillery woke up.\n\n\"A shell fell in the street behind us and got 17 people. Other kills around us,\" Teskey wrote.\n\nWhen dusk arrived on Nov. 9, the Patricias had fought their way into Jemappes on the outskirts of Mons.\n\nThe war was nearly over and the troops could sense it.\n\n\"It is too bad that chaps should have been killed within the last few days,\" Teskey wrote to his mother \u2014 without mentioning his own narrow escapes. \"I would hate to have been wounded and miss the rest of the fun.\"\n\n'I wondered when it was all going to end'\n\nTo Teskey, it also seemed as if the suffering of the civilians had reached a climax.\n\n\"Last night I saw wounded soldiers and civvies being carried to the dressing station and I wondered when it was all going to end,\" Teskey wrote on Nov. 11.\n\n\"One old man was hit in the arm and managed to walk as far as our billet and collapsed so we got a stretcher and I carried him the rest of the way.

At the same time, a battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) trotted across a hastily erected plank bridge into the northwest suburb of Mons, according to the Canadian Army's official history.\n\nCanadian troops approaching from the south were held up by demolished bridges and machine guns in the thickly tangled forest known as Bois la Haut.\n\nThe guns fired all night, according to an account written by the Sisters of Sacr\u00e9\u200b-Coeur and reprinted in the book Mons 1918-1918: The Beginning and the End.\n\n\"Sunday finished with a racket of cannons,\" the sisters' diarist wrote. \"We were convinced staying on the ground floor was dangerous as the noise doubled in intensity \u2026 We hurried through supper and spent a few moments recreation in the common room without any notion of the peril.\n\n\"Then after prayers we went down into the cellar where, despite the noise of the shelling, we fell asleep immediately after our previous sleepless nights.\"\n\n'An extraordinary calm'\n\nThe bombardment went on long after midnight.

Translated literally, it means small spirit berries.\n\nBeading was her way of telling a story \u2014 intricate and detailed floral designs imbued with our ancestral traditions.\n\nThe poppy, on the other hand, evoked my grandfather Harold McCue who ventured out from our tiny community of the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation in Ontario to serve overseas in the Second World War.\n\nI know little about his war years.

That prohibition lasted into the 1960s in some provinces.\n\nThat meant many First Nations veterans were banned from Royal Canadian Legion halls where veterans gathered to drink, and also get advice on post-war benefits. Instead, First Nations veterans were directed to Indian agents, who didn't always have their best interests in mind.\n\n\"Those are conversations that need to be had and a lot of people don't even necessarily recognize that there was any conflict there,\" said Ellis.\n\nIt takes Ellis about eight hours to make a beaded poppy, and she's sold over twenty this year. She charges $70 each and donates 10 per cent of proceeds to Wounded Warriors, a veterans charity that focuses on the mental health of injured vets.\n\nEllis has received overwhelmingly positive feedback, though the Royal Canadian Legion has been critical of individuals or organizations that commercialize poppies, including Indigenous artists.

They come with storage spaces, wardrobes, windows and complete bathrooms.\n\nOsborne House also has a dining room, and a medical room.\n\nEach room is equipped with a needle disposal unit, but the occupants are encouraged to use in the shared medical room instead.\n\nGalloway hopes that the injection site will help residents connect with staff and reduce any sense of hopelessness or isolation they may feel.\n\n\"We need to reduce that stigma [around drug use.] The opposite of addiction is connection,\" said Galloway.\n\nMission Flats is relatively isolated from the rest of Kamloops, and the society's executive director, Bob Hughes, said there will be a shuttle service that runs between Osborne House and the city.\n\nWith files from Daybreak Kamloops", "Manitoba rolled to gold at the Canadian Mixed Curling Championship in Winnipeg on Saturday.\n\nUp 4-1 after four ends against Nova Scotia, Manitoba held on for a 7-4 victory to seal the championship match.\n\n\"After the first round it seemed that every time we were needing to win a game, we'd win that game. And whether it was a pretty win or kind of a grind we still managed to pull it out,\" said team lead Colin Kurz. \"So I think after a couple of those extra end or last rock wins that maybe the home crowd was helping us out.\"\n\nThe victory was sealed in the eighth end when Kurz curled a perfect high-weight shot to remove Nova Scotia's shot stone. Even though the shooter didn't stick around, Manitoba posted two points.\n\nKurz credited his teammates for setting him up in ideal positions each end.\n\n\"I was left with, for the most part, pretty easy shots,\" said Kurz. \"They just put me in the best position they could have.\"\n\nThe win was Manitoba's ninth Canadian mixed curling gold, and first since 2009.\n\nQuebec, who'd lost to Manitoba in the semifinal earlier in the day, edged Ontario 7-6 to take home the bronze medal thanks to a single in the final end.\n\nThe semifinals and medal matches were featured today and can be viewed in the video players below.\n\nNova Scotia and Manitoba earned victories in the semis:\n\nComplete coverage of the semifinals at the Canadian Mixed Curling Championships in Winnipeg. 2:19:09\n\nManitoba then took the crown with a 7-4 win over Nova Scotia in th gold-medal match:", "A series of raids in northern Manitoba netted police a cache of drugs and guns this week.\n\nOn Thursday police raided a home in Thompson and seized 58 grams of cocaine along with drug trafficking paraphernalia.
