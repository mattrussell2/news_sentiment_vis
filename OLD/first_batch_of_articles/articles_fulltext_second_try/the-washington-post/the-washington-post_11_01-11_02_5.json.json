["President Trump\u2019s decision to send as many as 15,000 troops to the southern border has drawn sharp and unusual criticism from former military leaders, who have called the deployment \u201cwasteful\u201d and raised worries that the president might be using the military as a political tool to influence the midterm elections just days away.\n\n\u201cThe military has all of a sudden been placed in a highly politicized environment regarding immigration,\u201d retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said of the surge of troops to the border.\n\nThe blunt criticism of the mission to block what Trump contends is a threatening caravan of migrants encouraged by Democrats reflects the strain that his unusual presidency has put on one of America\u2019s most important norms: the tradition of an apolitical military.\n\nOther presidents have deployed forces to the border. But the timing of this deployment and the questionable need for it, with the caravan at least a month away from the border with Mexico and diminishing in size, have led many former military officers to deliver their harshest criticisms yet of Trump.\n\nIt has also put Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who has worked to keep the military out of politics, in a tough spot. Asked this week if the deployment was a \u201cpolitical stunt,\u201d the former Marine general bristled, \u201cWe don\u2019t do political stunts.\u201d\n\nThe president has cast the caravan as containing potential terrorists and other \u201ctough\u201d men who would particularly pose a threat to women \u2014 who are among the most sought-after voters in Tuesday\u2019s election. In fact, women and children are commonplace among the caravaners, who have said they intend to seek legal asylum in the United States.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump told reporters in the White House on Thursday that the caravan of migrants in southern Mexico represented an \u201cinvasion.\u201d (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nIn a tweet Thursday, retired Gen. Martin Dempsey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called the border operation a \u201cwasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines.\u201d\n\nDempsey\u2019s tweet echoed the opinion of several other senior military officers who weighed in on social media or in interviews.\n\n\u201cI see no threat requiring this kind of deployment,\u201d retired Gen. Colin Powell, also a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told The Washington Post.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Jim Dubik, who oversaw the effort to build the Iraqi army and police, said that Trump\u2019s description of the migrant caravan as an \u201cinvasion\u201d was wrong. \u201cA sizable portion of those coming are women and children,\u201d he said.\n\nThe public criticism from former military officials raised questions about why the president had decided to dispatch such a large force on such short notice days before a critical election.\n\n\u201cThe real issue is whether the military is being used for partisan political purposes,\u201d said Dubik, a senior fellow with the Institute for the Study of War. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I think such a use represents not just a wasteful deployment but a dangerous one. It\u2019s dangerous because it will politicize the use of force in ways a democracy should avoid.\u201d\n\nRetired Col. Paul Yingling, who commanded U.S. troops in Iraq, was more blunt.\n\n\u201cThis operation is a political stunt,\u201d he wrote for the military publication Task & Purpose.\n\nMore than any other president in recent decades, Trump has spoken of the military as if it were part of his political base, rather than an apolitical defender of the nation. He placed several retired generals in his cabinet. In speeches before military audiences, at which presidents usually steer clear of politics and focus on foreign policy or praise troops for their sacrifice, Trump has bragged to the troops about the size of his electoral win.\n\n\u201cWe had a wonderful election, didn\u2019t we?\u201d he said in a speech at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa a few months after his inauguration. \u201cAnd I saw those numbers, and you liked me, and I liked you.\u201d\n\nTrump hit that same theme Thursday night at a rally in Missouri. \u201cThe military is for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vets are for us. The veterans are all for us.\u201d\n\nThe deployment of the troops to the border, however, pushed Trump and the White House into new territory and prompted an almost unprecedented response from former officers such as Dempsey who had vowed to play an apolitical role.\n\nTwo years ago, in the midst of one of the most contentious presidential campaigns in U.S. history, Dempsey criticized some of his fellow retired generals for picking a side in the bitter political fight.\n\n\u201cThe military is not a political prize,\u201d the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs wrote in a letter to The Post. Service personnel, and the public, \u201cshould not wonder about the political leanings and motivations of their [military] leaders,\u201d he said\n\nHis description Thursday of the border mission as \u201cwasteful\u201d drew approval from many of his fellow generals, even as it prompted others to wonder if he and others had gone too far.\n\n\u201cWhile it is certainly fair to criticize the policy decision to send more troops to the border, I worry about characterizing the mission the way that some have,\u201d said retired Gen. Carter Ham, head of the Association of the United States Army, which advocates for the service\u2019s mission. \u201cThe troops need to know that they have our support, whether we agree with the deployment or not. . . . I think this is one of the important lessons of Vietnam.\u201d\n\nIn the recent past, the Pentagon has seemed to go out of its way to ensure that U.S. military operations did not bleed into domestic politics. U.S. soldiers and Marines were in place for an offensive against insurgents in the Iraqi city of Fallujah several weeks before the 2004 U.S. presidential election, but the assault was delayed until days later, on Nov. 7.\n\nTop Marine officers, including Mattis, who was then a major general, worried that launching a massive assault on the city could be viewed by partisans on both sides as an attempt to influence the electoral outcome.\n\nAs defense secretary, Mattis has worked to insulate the military from the country\u2019s increasingly toxic political battles. Unlike other secretaries, he refused early in the administration to lavish Trump with praise at a cabinet meeting.\n\nLast spring, in remarks that went viral, he advised U.S. troops in Jordan to \u201chold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it.\u201d\n\nMattis\u2019s political independence has raised questions in the president\u2019s mind about his loyalty. \u201cI think he\u2019s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d recently.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Mattis advised Trump to delay the border deployment or whether he was consulted about the president\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe president thinks out loud and will make statements about things he wants to do that haven\u2019t emerged out\u201d of discussion with his national security team, said Peter Feaver, a top official in George W. Bush\u2019s White House.\n\nFeaver speculated that Mattis likely would have advised Trump to delay the deployment until after the election to \u201ctake politicization out of the equation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that ship has sailed,\u201d \u00adFeaver said. \u201cGiven where we are, it\u2019s a little late for that.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, he would advise Mattis to make the best of a bad situation.\n\nTrump made Mattis\u2019s job more difficult Thursday when, after a White House speech on immigration, he said that U.S. troops should be authorized to open fire on unarmed migrants if they appear to pose a threat. \u201cWhen they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle,\u201d Trump said. His remarks drew a torrent of criticism from former military officials.\n\nDempsey said the troops would ignore the order. In a tweet, retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who commanded the 1st Armored Division in Iraq, called it \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no leader in the military . . . who would allow a soldier to shoot at an individual throwing a rock,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn Friday, Trump backed away from that heated rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t have to fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want is . . . these people throwing rocks.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the military\u2019s rules of engagement make it highly unlikely that U.S. troops could find themselves standing toe-to-toe with rock-throwing migrants. A spokesman for U.S. Northern Command, Mike Kucharek, said that while in the United States, troops can deploy with their weapons stored, but Mattis and Air Force Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, who oversees the command, must authorize them to be armed.\n\nAn internal Pentagon document obtained by The Post said that lethal force was authorized in the operation only in situations \u201cwhere lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably employed.\u201d Active-duty troops, which are functioning only in a support role, are also not permitted to arrest the migrants.\n\nIn any case, the migrants are still about 40 days from coming anywhere close to the U.S. border.", "", "The Trump administration is waiting to see the results of a Saudi investigation into the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, according to U.S. officials, and appears in no hurry to decide whether and how to punish Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe only specific response suggested so far has come from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said this week that the administration was \u201creviewing putting sanctions on the individuals . . . engaged in that murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take us probably a handful more weeks before we have enough evidence to actually put these sanctions in place,\u201d Pompeo said in a radio interview Thursday, \u201cbut I think we\u2019ll be able to get there.\u201d The Saudis have made 18 arrests of mostly security agents they say were involved in the killing of Khashoggi, a self-exiled Saudi journalist critical of the ruling monarchy, during an Oct. 2 visit he made to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have expressed outrage at Khashoggi\u2019s violent death, and some have demanded harsh action ranging from suspension of U.S. arms sales and military cooperation to ending discussions over a U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear agreement. Some have called for the administration to use the Khashoggi case as leverage to force Saudi Arabia to end its brutal, U.S.-assisted war in Yemen, and to bring to a close its dispute with Persian Gulf neighbor Qatar, another U.S. ally.\n\n[Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is \u2018chief of the tribe\u2019 in a cowed House of Saud]\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is continue on with a \u2018business as usual\u2019 response\u201d toward Saudi Arabia, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said last month, even before the kingdom had acknowledged that its own personnel carried out the premeditated killing of Khashoggi and arranged for the disappearance of his body.\n\nIndividual temperatures have been high, but the midterm elections and the impossibility during a congressional recess of holding hearings on what the administration knows and intends to do have limited any coordinated oversight.\n\nWhile President Trump has demanded the truth and all options are said to be on the table, he has repeatedly emphasized that business as usual with Saudi Arabia is precisely what he has in mind. He has cited the economic importance of Saudi purchases of U.S. weapons, the stability of international oil markets and what he considers the kingdom\u2019s key role in advancing U.S. objectives in the Middle East.\n\nTrump, Pompeo said, \u201chas made very clear not only do we have important commercial relationships, but important strategic relationships, national security relationships with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and we intend to make sure that those relationships remain intact.\u201d\n\nPompeo has said the United States will not be bound by either the Turkish or Saudi version of events but will develop its own information and come to its own conclusions. He is pushing the Saudis hard to rapidly finish their investigation of the killing, one U.S. official said, and has stressed the need for full transparency in conversations with King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting the Saudis to come up with something that\u2019s very close to what we all know,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of wiggle room.\u201d U.S. and foreign officials discussed the sensitive diplomatic matter only on condition of anonymity.\n\n[After Khashoggi vanishes, focus shifts to young prince\u2019s \u2018dark\u2019 and bullying side]\n\nThe question of \u201cwhat we all know\u201d is key. Saudi Arabia has unequivocally denied any high-level approval for the Khashoggi operation. But current and former U.S. officials, and virtually all outside experts on the kingdom, insist that the planning and carrying out of the killing could not have occurred without the knowledge and approval of the powerful Mohammed.\n\nThere is little expectation that the Saudis will implicate him, despite his known personal animus toward Khashoggi, his uncontested control over affairs large and small inside the kingdom, and the fact that many of those now under arrest are security agents working for the Saudi leadership.\n\nTurkey has all but directly accused Mohammed, a rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for dominance in the Muslim world. \u201cWho gave the order to kill this kind soul?\u201d Erdogan asked in an opinion column published Friday in The Washington Post, where Khashoggi was a contributing columnist. \u201cWe know that the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome seem to hope this \u2018problem\u2019 will go away in time,\u201d he wrote, noting that his government had \u201cshared evidence with our friends and allies, including the United States.\u201d\n\nThat evidence includes a recording made during the murder inside the consulate, which the Turks played for CIA Director Gina Haspel when she visited Turkey last week.\n\nWhatever the administration concludes, it would be difficult to retain the current close U.S. ties to the kingdom while holding the crown prince responsible for the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nIn a speech Wednesday in Washington to the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, a senior member of the Saudi royal family strongly suggested that what he called the \u201cdemonization\u201d of Saudi Arabia would have consequences.\n\nPrince Turki al-Faisal, son of a former king and cousin of the crown prince, is a former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to both the United States and Britain, as well as a once-close associate of Khashoggi\u2019s. Known as a pillar of the more moderate and internationally minded branch of the royal family, he rejected, in remarks last week to Post columnist David Ignatius, any suggestion that the kingdom might want to marginalize the ambitious Mohammed. \u201cThe more criticism there is of the crown prince, the more popular he is in the kingdom,\u201d Turki said.\n\nAt the conference, Turki noted that the U.S.-Saudi alliance had kept oil markets stable and combated terrorism, and he said that the \u201cpillars\u201d of cooperation were now \u201cchallenged.\u201d But, he warned that \u201cthe importance of Saudi Arabia has not changed. . . . The kingdom is the center of the Islamic world.\u201d\n\nMoreover, \u201cpeople in glass houses should not cast stones,\u201d Turki said. \u201cCountries that have tortured and incarcerated innocent people\u201d and \u201claunched a war that killed many thousands . . . based on fabricated information, should be humble in their regard to others,\u201d he said, a clear reference to U.S. counterterrorism policy and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nTurki suggested a double standard was being applied to Saudi Arabia. Innocent Palestinians \u201care slaughtered every day by the Israeli army,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet, I do not see the same media frenzy, the demand to bring the perpetrators and whoever ordered them to kill those children to justice.\u201d\n\nThe current controversy comes as the administration is preparing Monday to implement international prohibitions against buying oil from Iran. Countries that comply with the sanctions will have to look elsewhere for their supply, and the administration is counting on Saudi Arabia to increase its production to make up the difference and avert a jump in oil prices at a politically sensitive time.\n\nA sharp U.S. call this week for a cease-fire and negotiations in Yemen appeared to have had little impact, as the Saudi-led military coalition launched a fresh offensive there, attacking the rebel-controlled international airport in the capital, Sanaa, as well as the port of Hodeida, a vital gateway for humanitarian aid entering the devastated country.\n\nDuring his May 2017 visit to Riyadh, Trump announced $110 billion in what he indicated were newly agreed U.S. military sales to Saudi Arabia, a figure inflated by including agreements made during the previous Obama administration and long-term letters of intent for purchases over at least a decade in the future.\n\nFrom the beginning of the administration until now, final contracts worth approximately $14.5 billion have been signed, including for Chinook helicopters, training agreements and a portion of about $7 billion in precision guided munitions, much of which has been held up by bipartisan congressional objections to their use in Yemen.\n\nThe largest proposed sale in the announced package, $15 billion for THAAD antimissile defense batteries, remains in negotiations after the Saudis missed a Sept. 30 signing deadline. Saudi Arabia has said publicly that it is also negotiating with Russia for an antimissile system, the purchase of which would trigger U.S. sanctions against countries purchasing sophisticated Russian weaponry.\n\nDefense sales pass through Congress before being finalized \u2014 first for \u201cinformal\u201d approval by the chairmen and ranking minority members of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees. Once that is finished, Congress is formally \u201cnotified\u201d of the proposed sale and has 30 days to object by majority vote, subject to presidential veto.\n\nAt the moment, no Saudi weapons sales have been submitted for formal review, and five informal cases are under an indefinite hold imposed by the House and Senate minorities.\n\nSudarsan Raghavan in Cairo contributed to this report.", "Columnist\n\nWhen Oregon State football coach Jonathan Smith gathered his coaches in the locker room at halftime last Saturday afternoon at Folsom Field in Colorado, he really wasn\u2019t thinking about winning the game.\n\nColorado was leading, 24-3, and the Beavers appeared well on their way to dropping to 1-7 in Smith\u2019s first season back at his alma mater.\n\n\u201cMy thought was, \u2018Let\u2019s go back out there and have some good possessions, try to move the football, build a little momentum for next Saturday and for the rest of the season,\u2019\u201d Smith said this week. \u201cThe doctors had cleared Jake to play late in the week, and even though I knew he wasn\u2019t completely healthy, I thought it was time to give him a shot.\u201d\n\nSmith was talking about Jake Luton, the Beavers\u2019 fifth-year senior quarterback whose college career has been both an odyssey and, at times, a travesty.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018Go out there and don\u2019t think about the scoreboard at all,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cJust go back to the old clich\u00e9, try to make a play, then another play and see what it adds up to.\u201d\n\nColorado scored on the first play of the second half, a 75-yard run by Travon McMillian to make it 31-3, but then Luton began making plays, leading two touchdown drives. It was 31-17 at the end of three quarters.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I was thinking that we were only down two scores and there was still a quarter to play,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re still down, but I figured anything could happen.\u201d\n\n[A huge weekend for SEC football reveals the ever-expanding empire of Sabanistan]\n\nAnything did. Luton kept completing passes \u2014 playing only the second half, he finished with 310 yards and three touchdown passes \u2014 and the Beavers drove the length of the field to tie the score at 34 with 29 seconds left. And then the extra point was blocked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you what I was thinking when that happened,\u201d Luton said. \u201cNothing you can repeat. But I looked around and saw no one flinch, no one moan. There was no woe-is-us at all. It was amazing.\u201d\n\nEspecially amazing for a team that had lost to California, 49-7, at home a week earlier and had lost 22 straight road games.\n\nColorado missed a long field-goal attempt as time expired in regulation. Then, Oregon State needed five plays to score what proved to be the winning touchdown in overtime.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing feeling,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen I got here I told the players we needed everybody in order to compete this year. A lot of that was meant for the seniors. I didn\u2019t want them to feel discarded just because we all know this is a long-term project.\u201d\n\nLuton is one of the 13 seniors left on the team. He had been the backup quarterback at Idaho as a sophomore, transferred to Ventura Community College for a year and then arrived at Oregon State as a redshirt junior in 2017. He began that season as the starting quarterback but took what Smith described as a \u201cvicious hit\u201d in the fourth game of the season against Washington State. He suffered a thoracic spine fracture and missed the rest of the season.\n\nBy the time he was ready to think about playing again, Coach Gary Andersen had resigned halfway through the season and been replaced by interim Cory Hall. The Beavers\u2019 horrific season ended with a 69-10 loss at Oregon, and they finished 1-11. Five days later, Smith, a 2002 graduate, who had been Washington\u2019s offensive coordinator, was named the new coach.\n\n\u201cI knew coming in there was a lot of work to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019d been around when we had success and both [Dennis] Erickson and [Mike] Riley had proven you could win here. Plus, it\u2019s my school.\u201d\n\nRiley had recruited Smith to Corvallis as a preferred walk-on in 1997. He had signed one of Smith\u2019s high school teammates, Dustin Janz, and offered Smith the chance to walk on.\n\n\u201cMy grandma lived in Corvallis, so I knew the area a little,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus it was a chance to play in the Pac-10.\u201d\n\nThere was another incentive.\n\n\u201cI knew back then that I wanted to coach,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d coach high school and teach history and playing in the Pac-10 would give me a chance to watch some very good coaches close up.\u201d\n\n[Postcards from College Football America: Five days, four campuses, three games and a memorial]\n\nIn 1998, as a redshirt freshman, Smith became the starting quarterback on a team that went 5-6. That was Oregon State\u2019s 28th consecutive losing season, dating to 1970 when a Dee Andros-coached team had gone 6-5.\n\nAfter that season, Riley was hired to coach the San Diego Chargers, and Erickson took his place. In his first season, the Beavers were 7-5, breaking the string of losing seasons. A year later, they went 11-1, humiliated Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl and finished ranked fourth in the country.\n\n\u201cHe brought swagger to the program,\u201d Smith said. \u201cCoach Riley had started the process, bringing in some good young players who had become veterans. Coach Erickson brought in some junior college players and transfers who were older and talented and had a chip on their shoulder.\u201d\n\nErickson left after four seasons to return to the NFL (in San Francisco) and Riley returned. He had solid success over the next 12 years, then left again, this time for Nebraska. Andersen succeeded him and struggled mightily, going a combined 7-29 the next three seasons.\n\nAlthough there are four transfers sitting out this season who will play as sophomores next fall, Smith wants to build the program mostly through recruiting high school players.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quicker to go the JUCO-transfer route; I know that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there will be kids we\u2019ll go after to bring some experience in right away. But I believe if you want to build something solid long-term, you need to do it with kids who will be with you for four and five years.\u201d\n\nAs emotional as the win over Colorado was, the rest of the schedule is daunting: Southern Cal, Stanford, Washington and the annual \u201cCivil War\u201d game against Oregon.\n\n\u201cI told the guys on Tuesday that the feeling we had on Saturday was because of the work we\u2019d done last week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and that if we want that feeling again, we have to keep working just as hard,\u201d Smith said. He laughed and added, \u201cthe one thing I don\u2019t think we have to worry about just yet is being overconfident.\u201d\n\nLuton knows he has just four games left in his college career. But regardless of how November plays out, he and his teammates will have one very sweet memory to take away from this fall.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of nights after I got hurt last year where I lay awake, wondering if I\u2019d ever get another chance,\u201d he said. \u201cSaturday made all that\u2019s happened worth it.

Obama\u201d and writing out the \u201cH\u201d with his finger in the air.\n\nEarlier, the president arrived in West Virginia on Friday afternoon amid signs that Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) maintains a strong chance of retaining his seat despite running in the most pro-Trump state in 2016.\n\nA leading Republican super PAC has retreated from the airwaves in West Virginia, after spending millions in recent months. The Senate Leadership Fund is no longer airing television advertisements in the race, instead making more modest investments in get-out-the-vote efforts and digital advertising.\n\nDuring the Huntington rally, which ran just under an hour, Trump criticized Manchin for waiting until all Senate Republicans had announced how they would vote on the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to reveal his position.\n\nTrump recounted a phone call he had with Manchin just a few days before the final confirmation vote, when the president urged him to come out in favor of Kavanaugh: \u201cJoe, I need the vote, like, today.\u201d\n\nManchin did ultimately support Kavanaugh, but he announced his backing \u201cone-eighth of one second\u201d \u2014 according to Trump\u2019s retelling \u2014 after Sen.

Many of Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters, though, cited his endorsement of Morrisey as a big factor in their decisions, saying they may have liked Manchin in the past but could no longer count on him.\n\n\u201cThe thing that swayed me is Trump,\u201d said Rick Kirk, 61, who said he switched his registration from Democrat to Republican three years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think Manchin is a bad person \u2014 and I do think he has West Virginia values \u2014 but I want someone who is going to support Trump.\u201d\n\nCasey Talbert, 30, said she voted for Machin when he ran in 2012 but is supporting Morrisey because \u201cwe need people who are going to support President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nTalbert said she was glad that Manchin was the sole Democrat to vote for Kavanaugh but that it didn\u2019t persuade her to vote for him.\n\nSamantha Ray, 48, described Manchin\u2019s vote on Kavanaugh as \u201cgrasping at straws\u201d in an attempt to win support from Republicans who overwhelmingly favored his confirmation.\n\nRay, of Huntington, said Manchin \u201cused to be a good guy, but has gone from one side of the fence to the other too often.\u201d\n\nMiller, who is running in a surprisingly close congressional race against Democrat Richard Ojeda, praised Trump and sharply criticized her opponent, whom the crowd loudly booed.\n\n\u201cEvery time my opponent opens his mouth I am disgusted,\u201d Miller said of Ojeda, whom Trump has called a \u201cwacko\u201d and \u201cstone-cold crazy.\u201d Ojeda, who voted for Trump in 2016, initially responded by embracing the label, releasing a video in which he said, \u201cIf I\u2019m crazy . . . because it\u2019s hard for me to sleep at night knowing that we got kids who go to bed hungry, then I\u2019ll be crazy wacky.\u201d\n\nKim reported from Washington.

U.S. District Judge Peter J. Messitte in Greenbelt, Md., denied the Justice Department\u2019s request that he pause the case in order to allow a higher court to intervene. And he sharply questioned the president\u2019s position that his business does not improperly accept gifts or payments \u2014 called emoluments \u2014 as defined by the Constitution. By Trump\u2019s analysis, Messitte wrote, the term emoluments is the subject of such \u201csubstantial grounds of disagreement\u201d that payments his business received from foreign governments could not qualify. The judge did not agree: \u201cThe Court finds this a dubious proposition.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of suits out there that could expose Trump to some serious political danger, and this is one of them.

In public and private, Trump and advisers are pointing to the president\u2019s surge of campaigning on behalf of Republican Senate candidates \u2014 19 rallies alone since Labor Day \u2014 as evidence that nobody else could have had a bigger impact in the states. The argument is classic Trump, who despite making the midterms a referendum on his own presidency, has a history of personalizing and then dwelling on his victories while distancing himself and diverting attention from his losses. Should Republicans pick up Senate seats, \u201cthat\u2019s all they\u2019ll talk about,\u201d said Barry Bennett, a presidential adviser on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s where the math is in our favor.\u201d Even in the House, where Republicans are laboring to sustain their 23-seat majority, the White House is already dismissing any notion of a Democratic wave election on par with the Republican midterm pickups under former presidents Barack Obama or Bill Clinton.\n\nSo if the Democrats win the House with anything less than the 54-seat net Republicans got in 1994, Trump will say it was a victory.

(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nFaulty wiring. Bad welding. Poor paint jobs. Metro has had more than its share of problems with its newest fleet of rail cars, the 7000 series.\n\nNow it appears those issues are catching up with the company that manufactures the rail cars.\n\nCiting disappointing quarterly financial results, a top executive at Kawasaki Heavy Industries said this week that it is contemplating getting out of the rail car building business.\n\nAccording to Jiji Press, Kawasaki chief executive Yoshinori Kanehana said the company may consider forming a business alliance or closing down its rail vehicle business if it can\u2019t turn things around.\n\nThe Lincoln Journal Star reported that Kawasaki, in announcing its quarterly earnings, said its rolling stock division, which has an assembly plant in Lincoln, Neb., lost more than $78 million for the first two quarters of its fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. Some of those losses were tied to contracts with Metro and the Long Island Railroad, which have proved less profitable than the company anticipated.\n\nKawasaki did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post on the losses or the potential shuttering of its rail-car division.\n\nHowever, even if Kawasaki were to abandon its rail-car business, it\u2019s unlikely to have an impact on its contract with Metro. The company has a $2-billion contract with the transit agency to build 748 rail cars, replacements for the most problematic in the agency\u2019s fleet.\n\n\u201cMetro has a binding contract with Kawasaki, and to date, they have delivered 600 of 748 rail cars,\u201d Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said via email. \u201cWe expect to have all 748 on the system late next year, ahead of schedule.\u201d\n\nShe added that Metro did not anticipate problems with finding replacement parts for the trains in the future because the parts are manufactured by U.S.-based suppliers under federal Buy America requirements.\n\nThe new trains have had their own problems. Officials identified design flaws as far back as 2015. There were delays in manufacturing, due in part to the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. But in recent months, there have been reports of other problems.\n\nIn June, federal regulators ordered Metro officials to retrofit the 7000-series cars already in service with new safety devices to prevent passengers from falling between train cars. The order came after a blind passenger fell into a gap between two cars and onto the tracks in May.\n\nThen in August, Metro officials announced that wiring in all of the trains would have to be replaced after internal inspections identified flaws, which could affect the rail cars' long term reliability.\n\nLy said work on the wiring is ongoing but because it did not require immediate action, it will be done as part of the routine maintenance process.\n\n\u201cMetro is the process of developing a long-term schedule for the rail car manufacturer, Kawasaki, to perform the work under its contract obligations,\u201d Ly said in an email.\n\nAs of July, Metro had received 564 of the 748 rail cars it had ordered. Roughly 548 of those cars were in service, but would have to be pulled out for rewiring.\n\n[Latest problems with Metro's 7000-series rail cars: defective wiring that will have to be redone]\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the company going out of business might impact any future problems Metro might have with the rail cars.", "Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, left, has acknowledged that he and former White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon had discussed putting a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. (Reuters)\n\nThe Supreme Court refused Friday to delay an upcoming trial in which a number of states and civil rights organizations allege there was an improper political motive in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to begin Monday in New York.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch said they would have granted the Trump administration\u2019s request to delay the trial. It is unclear how the other six voted \u2014 including new Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 because justices are not required to publish their votes in such procedures. But at least five of the six were unwilling to block the trial.\n\nLater Friday night, the justices refused a Trump administration request to halt a novel lawsuit filed by young Americans that attempts to force the federal government to take action on climate change. Thomas and Gorsuch would have granted the request, but the court said the administration should make its appeal to a lower court first.\n\nIn the Commerce Department case, the administration has been to the high court several times in an attempt to keep the challengers from questioning Ross and other administration officials about their motivations in adding the question. Department of Justice lawyers finally asked the court to delay the proceedings.\n\nChallengers to the citizenship question cheered the court\u2019s refusal to do so.\n\n\u201cDOJ has tried every trick in the book (and then some) to block this case \u2014 and failed every time,\u201d Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood (D), said in a statement. \u201cYou really have to wonder what they\u2019re trying to hide.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and immigrant rights groups have blasted the idea of adding the citizenship question. They contend that it will make immigrants and their families less likely to fill out the form, leading to a more costly and less accurate census.\n\nSix former census directors and a Census Bureau internal analyst also have said the question would harm the count. That, in turn, could cost states with large immigrant populations representation in Congress and federal funds distributed on the basis of population.\n\n[Federal judge compels Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to be deposed in suit challenging citizenship question]\n\nThe question was asked in the past, but it has been decades since it was part of the routine decennial census questioning. The administration has said that any challenge to the Commerce Department action should be based on the administrative record, not probes of how top government officials decided it should be added.\n\nSolicitor General Noel J. Francisco told the court that Ross had explained his actions and said it was improper for courts to authorize \u201can intrusive fishing expedition involving the depositions of high-ranking government officials, including a cabinet secretary.\u201d\n\nIn an unsigned opinion Oct. 22, the Supreme Court blocked a deposition of Ross authorized by lower federal courts in New York. But it said other discovery could go forward, including the deposition of a top Justice Department official.\n\n[Supreme Court shields Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross from answering questions in census controversy]\n\nThere are six legal challenges to the inclusion of a question about a census respondent\u2019s citizenship.\n\nThe states and organizations that brought the lawsuits say probing the intentions of officials is crucial. Ross has \u201coffered shifting and inaccurate explanations in his decisional memo and in testimony before Congress\u201d as well as in new documents filed in the case, said a brief filed by the New York Immigration Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union and others.\n\nRoss first said he added the citizenship question at the behest of the Justice Department, which said it was needed to help enforce voting rights.\n\nBut emails showed that he had been pushing for the inclusion of the citizenship question earlier than that, and the groups and states contend that the Justice Department request was a pretext.\n\nIn a document filed in response to questions sent by Underwood, Ross acknowledged that he had discussed the issue with former White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon and a Republican secretary of state who has been a leader in anti-immigration efforts.\n\n[New document contradicts Ross\u2019s congressional testimony on census citizenship question]\n\nIn the document, Ross said he recalled Bannon calling him in spring 2017 to ask whether Ross would speak to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach about ideas for a possible citizenship question on the census.\n\nThat appears to contradict Ross\u2019s testimony to Congress this year. When asked at a hearing March 20 by Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) whether the president or anyone in the White House had discussed the citizenship question with him, Ross said, \u201cI am not aware of any such.\u201d\n\nThe trial is scheduled to start next week before U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in New York. He has denied the Trump administration\u2019s motions for delay, and has been backed up by panels of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.\n\nIn asking the Supreme Court for a delay, Francisco said \u201cthe most efficient path forward is to stay the trial and resolve the question whether the district court must confine its review of the Secretary\u2019s decision to the administrative record, while leaving sufficient time for the district court to conduct its review followed by prompt appellate review.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, Francisco said, there will be a full trial that includes \u201cwhether the Secretary harbored secret racial animus in reinstating a citizenship question to the decennial census.\u201d\n\nIf the judge made such a finding, Francisco said, \u201cthat harm would not be fully (or even largely) remedied if [the Supreme Court] subsequently confined the district court\u2019s review to the administrative record.\u201d\n\nTara Bahrampour contributed to this report.", "", "\n\nPresident Trump addresses young black conservative leaders from across the country on the state of the economy as part of the 2018 Young Black Leadership Summit at the White House on Oct. 26, 2018, in Washington. (Pete Marovich/Getty Images)\n\nReporter\n\nFiscal stimulus works.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest takeaway from another very strong month of job growth that kept the unemployment rate at an almost 50-year low of 3.7 percent. Specifically, the latest report showed we added another 250,000 jobs in October to bring our monthly average for the year up to a healthy 213,000. It was a slightly less robust 182,000 in 2017.\n\nThe good news, though, didn\u2019t stop there. So many more people were both looking for and finding work that the share of adults with jobs increased 0.2 percentage points to a post-crisis high of 60.6 percent, while the share of 25-to-54-year-olds \u2014 who should be in the prime of their working years \u2014 who are working went up an even better 0.4 percentage points to, yes, another post-2008 peak of 79.7 percent. That\u2019s still a little lower than it was before the housing bubble burst and a good bit below where it was before the tech bubble did, but that\u2019s the point: There are still some \u201cmissing workers\u201d out there who we should be able to get off the sidelines if we can keep the recovery going. Especially if wage growth continues to pick up, as it has recently. It increased to 3.1 percent over the past year \u2014 the highest it\u2019s been since 2009 \u2014 which should make working only more attractive for people who want to but, for whatever reason, are not working right now.\n\nPut it all together, then, and you get a picture of an economy that\u2019s firing on as many cylinders as it has in a long time. We\u2019re in a virtuous cycle where more people are working and are being paid more for that work, but, because there are still many people looking for jobs, those raises aren\u2019t so big that inflation might get too high. It\u2019s an economy that\u2019s solidly in the Goldilocks zone of fast-enough growth to raise people\u2019s living standards but not so fast as to raise concerns about price stability at the Federal Reserve.\n\nNow, we shouldn\u2019t overstate the difference between the 2.5 million jobs the economy is on pace to add this year and the 2.2 million it added the year before. But it\u2019s worth pointing out for a simple reason: It\u2019s not what we\u2019d expect to happen. The lower the unemployment rate gets, after all, the fewer people there should be who want jobs but don\u2019t have any. That alone should make job growth slow. It hasn\u2019t, though, for an even simpler reason: The Trump administration has pushed a lot of money into the economy. Cutting taxes for corporations might not have much bang for the buck in terms of stimulus, but that doesn\u2019t matter too much when you\u2019re talking about 1.5 trillion bucks. That\u2019s going to do something, and it has.\n\nBut the question, of course, is how long it\u2019s going to last. The rationale behind the Trump tax cuts was that they would not only put more money in wealthy investors' pockets in the short-run but also \u2014 and more important \u2014 give companies extra incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing factories and equipment, boosting growth in the long run as well. So far, though, that really hasn\u2019t happened. Business investment was up only 0.8 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the deluge of money that was supposed to come in from overseas has been more like a slightly above-average trickle.\n\nThe lesson, then, is that even a bad stimulus can be good for the economy for a little while. A better stimulus would obviously be, well, better, but any kind can put people back to work even when you might not think there are many job-seeking people left. The real issue is whether the boost today will be worth the higher interest rates it will bring about tomorrow. The Trump tax cuts don\u2019t look as if they\u2019ll pass that test, but new infrastructure spending, which probably would have created more jobs right now and also set the stage for us to create more in the future by increasing our productive capacity, certainly might.\n\nUnfortunately, Trump preferred cutting rich people\u2019s taxes to building things everyone needs.

Never growing up did I imagine that games would look like this, so drenched in detail as to recall some of the exemplary painters in Western art. Thoughts like that tickled my brain during much of my first thirty hours with \u201cRed Dead Redemption 2.\u201d Since \u201cGrand Theft Auto IV\u201d (2008), I\u2019ve come to anticipate a kind of depthless feeling when beginning a new Rockstar game. The company that did the most to popularize open-world game design makes rabbit holes like no other. How many things can you do? How dazzling are the sites to be seen? How stellar is the music? These are the questions I\u2019ve entertained over the past decade whenever Rockstar drops a new game. In the interval before the answers come \u2014 before I fully know what my avatar can do, before I\u2019ve more-or-less grown used to the audiovisual flourishes \u2014 I lose myself in a way I rarely do with other megabudget games. From Rockstar, I\u2019ve come to expect the shock of the new.\n\nSet in 1899, during the twilight of the Old West, \u201cRed Dead Redemption 2\u2019 (\u201cRDR2\u201d) tells the story of the grinding dissolution of the Van der Linde gang. The fate of Dutch Van der Linde will be known to those who played the first game, yet the story of his gang\u2019s earlier days is as engrossing as anything in popular gaming. Whereas \u201cRed Dead Redemption\u201d (2010) concentrated on the wanderings of ex-Van der Linde-gang member John Marston, in \u201cRDR2,\u201d players assume the role of Marston\u2019s fellow gang member Arthur Morgan, a laconic man equally prone to compassion and brutality. Though the world of \u201cRDR2\u201d provides ample incentive to set out alone with your horse \u2014 to sightsee, hunt, fish, gamble, or look for weirdos to interact with \u2014 the game is hyper-focused on group dynamics. Indeed, the entire thrust of its opening moments is to establish just how beholden Arthur and the rest of his cohorts are to Dutch\u2019s charismatic leadership.\n\n\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 (Take Two-Interactive)\n\nDutch, who is prone to fits of mania and melancholy, is a dreamer who exhorts his followers to remain faithful to his vision of \u201cliving free,\u201d beyond the tangles of civilization with its taxes and sedentary habits. Dutch fancies himself both an outlaw, committed to an ideal of personal authenticity, and a hardened realist who sees the darkness in everyone including himself. He is a trusted boss until his erratic behavior begins to curdle the affections of those around him. Arthur\u2019s journey from vying for Dutch\u2019s approval (he\u2019s jealous of John Marston in the beginning) to questioning his judgment, is beautifully framed around his interaction with the other gang members.\n\nThe guiding joy of \u201cRDR2\u201d comes from hanging with your fellow outlaws, whether on a mission that sees you getting in or out of trouble or partaking in a bit of downtime at one of the campsites that acts as the gang\u2019s temporary home. Over the many hours I\u2019ve spent with the game, I\u2019ve appreciated the attention that went into crafting the varied personalities of the Van de Linde gang. Characters speak suggestively and give the impression of leaving things unsaid. You sense the weight of history behind them.\n\n\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 (Take Two-Interactive)\n\nOne of \u201cRDR2\u201d\u2019s technical innovations is its dialogue system. Unlike games that halt the action for conversational moments where you\u2019re free to respond at leisure, in \u201cRDR2,\u201d conversations outside of cutscenes or other scripted moments are initiated by pressing the left trigger to focus on a person, then choosing a conversational prompt using one of the controller\u2019s face buttons. I suspect other developers will implement this system because it gives the player dialogue options without pulling away from the surrounding activity. Another innovation of the game is its cinematic camera mode. Set a destination on the map for Arthur to go and then, with the press of a button, watch the picture on the screen shift into a wide-angled frame with black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. Although Rockstar has used cinematic camera angles in the past, the camera work here is on another level. No other game feels as natural to watch on autopilot as if it were a movie.\n\n\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 (Take Two-Interactive)\n\nOne of the moments I knew the game had worked its voodoo on me was when I recoiled a little at my first sight of the city of Saint Denis. After spending so much time in the countryside and in small towns, I briefly identified with Arthur\u2019s distaste for city life. Mind you, I live in Brooklyn. Need it be said that I\u2019ve to had to stop myself from playing into the waning hours over these past weeks? My cousin told me that the game made him feel glad to be alive. I couldn\u2019t agree more. And yet it\u2019s impossible to ignore the recent controversy surrounding the working conditions on \u201cRDR2.\u201d Kotaku and Eurogamer both reported on the labor that went into \u201c RDR2\u2019s\u201d production. It\u2019s a multifaceted story concerning different departments, spread across different studios, in different countries; however, it\u2019s clear that there are people who felt overworked. Given that Rockstar\u2019s prior game \u201cGrand Theft Auto V\u201d is the highest grossing media product in history and that \u201cRDR2\u2019 enjoyed what Rockstar Games is touting as the most lucrative weekend take for any media product in history, with $725 million in sales, one should hope that the company will use its resources to better things for all of its employees and inspire the industry at large.

No one \u2013 not even his fiancee, who was waiting outside the compound \u2014 has ever seen him again.\n\nOver the course of the past month, Turkey has moved heaven and earth to shed light on all aspects of this case. As a result of our efforts, the world has learned that Khashoggi was killed in cold blood by a death squad, and it has been established that his murder was premeditated.\n\nYet there are other, no less significant questions whose answers will contribute to our understanding of this deplorable act. Where is Khashoggi\u2019s body? Who is the \u201clocal collaborator\u201d to whom Saudi officials claimed to have handed over Khashoggi\u2019s remains? Who gave the order to kill this kind soul? Unfortunately, the Saudi authorities have refused to answer those questions.\n\nWe know the perpetrators are among the 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia. We also know those individuals came to carry out their orders: Kill Khashoggi and leave. Finally, we know the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\n\nSome seem to hope this \u201cproblem\u201d will go away in time. But we will keep asking those questions, which are crucial to the criminal investigation in Turkey, but also to Khashoggi\u2019s family and loved ones. A month after his killing, we still do not know where his body is. At the very least, he deserves a proper burial in line with Islamic customs. We owe it to his family and friends, including his former colleagues at The Post, to give them an opportunity to say their goodbyes and pay their respects to this honorable man. To ensure that the world will keep asking the same questions, we have shared the evidence with our friends and allies, including the United States.\n\nAs we continue to look for answers, I would like to stress that Turkey and Saudi Arabia enjoy friendly relations. I do not believe for a second that King Salman, the custodian of the holy mosques, ordered the hit on Khashoggi. Therefore, I have no reason to believe that his murder reflected Saudi Arabia\u2019s official policy. In this sense, it would be wrong to view the Khashoggi slaying as a \u201cproblem\u201d between two countries. Nonetheless, I must add that our friendship with Riyadh, which goes back a long time, doesn\u2019t mean we will turn a blind eye to the premeditated murder that unfolded in front of our very eyes. The killing of Khashoggi is inexplicable. Had this atrocity taken place in the United States or elsewhere, authorities in those countries would have gotten to the bottom of what happened. It would be out of the question for us to act any other way.\n\nNo one should dare to commit such acts on the soil of a NATO ally again. If anyone chooses to ignore that warning, they will face severe consequences. The Khashoggi murder was a clear violation and a blatant abuse of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Failure to punish the perpetrators could set a very dangerous precedent.\n\nThis is another reason we were shocked and saddened by the efforts of certain Saudi officials to cover up Khashoggi\u2019s premeditated murder rather than serve the cause of justice, as our friendship would require. Though Riyadh has detained 18 suspects, it is deeply concerning that no action has been taken against the Saudi consul general, who lied through his teeth to the media and fled Turkey shortly afterward. Likewise, the refusal of the Saudi public prosecutor \u2014 who recently visited his counterpart in Istanbul \u2014 to cooperate with the investigation and answer even simple questions is very frustrating. His invitation of Turkish investigators to Saudi Arabia for more talks about the case felt like a desperate and deliberate stalling tactic.\n\nThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi involves a lot more than a group of security officials, just as the Watergate scandal was bigger than a break-in and the 9/11 terror attacks went beyond the hijackers. As responsible members of the international community, we must reveal the identities of the puppetmasters behind Khashoggi\u2019s killing and discover those in whom Saudi officials \u2014 still trying to cover up the murder \u2014 have placed their trust.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The future of the Middle East depends on justice for Jamal Khashoggi\n\nHatice Cengiz: The international community must bring my fiance\u2019s killers to justice\n\nJamal Khashoggi: What the Arab world needs most is free expression\n\nAbdullah Alaoudh: We Saudis will never be silent about Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death\n\nJackson Diehl: Why so many Middle East observers bet on MBS", "\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment stars Bobby Lashley, left, and Seth Rollins perform during the Crown Jewel event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Turkish officials have said his body was dismembered and possibly dissolved in acid.\n\nLeadersin Congress and Europe have condemned the killing, demanding answers and punishment for Saudi Arabia. There is widespread suspicion that Prince Mohammed, the country\u2019s de facto leader, was behind the assassination \u2014 despite the Saudi government\u2019s vehement denials.\n\nLate last month, scores of influential sponsors and speakers boycotted Saudi\u2019s signature investment conference in Riyadh in protest of Khashoggi\u2019s killing.

(Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nThe odds suggest that Republicans are poised for a rough night Tuesday. We know, we know. Polls, right? Who can trust polls after they got 2016 wrong, what with predicting a victory of 3.2 points for Hillary Clinton when she won the popular vote by, uh, only 2.1 points.\n\nThat aside, though, an 85 percent chance of Democrats gaining a majority in the House (as FiveThirtyEight currently has it) is not a 100 percent chance. If we held the election 20 times, in three of those elections, the Republicans would hold their majority. Next Tuesday might be one of those three.\n\nOne of the factors that will determine whether it is? Turnout. We know, we know. It all comes down to turnout. But, you know, it\u2019s true. An unexpected surge in turnout from Democrats or Republicans and the models those polls are built on start moving possibilities around in short order.\n\nSo we embrace data like the numbers just released from Gallup, indicating the extent to which voters hope to send a message to the White House with their vote. This is the sort of thing that gets people off the couch on cold November Tuesdays: wanting to see their political opponents suffer a humiliating defeat.\n\nGallup\u2019s been asking if votes are meant to send a message since 1998. In the six midterm elections since (including 2018), no president has inspired more voters to want to send a message of opposition than President Trump.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nHowever!\n\nWe\u2019ve seen polling from Pew Research Center and others showing that, while opposition to Trump is a powerful motivation for votes, interest in showing support has also motivated a lot of people. In Gallup\u2019s data, fewer people want to send a message of support than one of opposition, but more people want to send a message overall than in past years, and the percentage saying they want to send a message of support is lower only than what George W. Bush enjoyed in 2002.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBush, at that point, was still enjoying a boost following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThose numbers get more dramatic when we isolate Republicans and Democrats. Most Republicans (and Republican-leaning independents) say they want to send a message of support. Most Democrats say they play to cast a vote to send a message of opposition.\n\nThe percentages of each group that plans to send such a message, though, is higher than in past years. Combined, the interest from partisans in sending a message is much higher.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWhy does this matter? Look at the past three cycles. In each case, the opposition very much wanted to send a message to the president. In each case, it did: The president\u2019s party lost House seats in each election and lost the majority in two. But they didn\u2019t enjoy the same level of enthusiasm from members of the party itself.\n\nThat\u2019s our point. If Republicans really want to show support for Trump, they\u2019ll go to the polls, perhaps more than pollsters expect.\n\nBut then there\u2019s another bit of data in that Gallup report: 44 percent of Democrats say they\u2019re more likely to vote solely to send that message of opposition. Only about 3 in 10 Republicans say they\u2019re more likely to vote just to send a message.\n\nIf Democrats really want to show opposition to Trump, they\u2019ll go to the polls, perhaps more than pollsters expect. FiveThirtyEight says the most likely outcome of the election is that the Democrats pick up 38 seats, but it\u2019s about as likely that they gain 60 seats as the Republicans keeping the House.\n\nWe know, we know. Math.", "Columnist\n\nUntil last week it seemed that the Division I college basketball industry could produce nothing more risible than its pieties about cherishing the amateurism of the \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d who generate, but get mere crumbs of, the industry\u2019s billions. Last week, however, a New York jury, which perhaps had a sense of humor, embraced this novel argument by the federal government: Basketball factories such as Kansas, Louisville and North Carolina State are actually victims of the operatives \u2014 representatives of shoe companies, and actual or aspiring agents \u2014 who use unsavory methods to direct \u201cblue chip\u201d recruits to the schools\u2019 lucrative basketball programs.\n\nThe three men convicted of fraud and conspiracy in the first of at least three similar trials face imprisonment because of this supposed crime: The three schools mentioned above gave athletic scholarships to five elite recruits whose families had received \u2014 presumably, but perhaps not really, unbeknownst to the schools \u2014 through the three men (one of them a former consultant for the Adidas shoe company) payments, one of $90,000, to purchase their help in directing their sons to those schools, which receive much larger payments to advertise, by wearing, Adidas gear. (Nike and Under Armour also compete in the auction for schools\u2019 allegiances.)\n\nMight the federal government\u2019s finite law enforcement resources serve more deserving victims? And why is it a federal crime to evade the NCAA\u2019s lackadaisical enforcement of its nonsensical rules by paying families? About schools maintaining (to borrow a phrase from politics) \u201cplausible deniability\u201d of the meat market in tall teenagers, Post columnist Sally Jenkins notes: \u201cDefense attorneys presented text messages between [former Adidas consultant T.J.] Gassnola and Kansas Coach Bill Self that showed the coach was well aware of Adidas\u2019s efforts to steer recruits to him, if not the method. Gassnola assured Self that Adidas was \u2018here to help\u2019 in getting players for the school, which was finalizing a 12-year, $191 million sponsorship deal with the sneaker company.\u201d Not bad compensation for Kansas-the-victim.\n\nA National Basketball Association program announced last month might somewhat diminish college basketball\u2019s stench, which the NBA made worse with its 2005 rule that teams could not sign players younger than 19. This created the \u201cone and done\u201d charade of players sort of attending, say, the University of Kentucky for one season, then turning pro. Elite 18-year-olds will now be able to receive $125,000 for a season in the NBA\u2019s developmental G League, draining some talent from the pipeline sustaining the cartel of college basketball powerhouses.\n\nPerhaps schools should give candor a try, paying their basketball and football players as value-adding employees who create almost all of the $8 billion that college sports generate. Undergraduate music majors are not forbidden to earn money with their talents while in school. Kentucky coach John Calipari\u2019s salary is $8 million, Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski\u2019s is $9 million, and 44 other head coaches earn more than $2 million, so perhaps something could trickle down to the \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d who now receive only tuition, room, board and small cost-of-living stipends. Taylor Branch, writing in the Atlantic in 2011, noted that the NCAA minted the phrase \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d to deflect the threat of injured athletes making workers\u2019 compensation claims.\n\nIn a California trial (a ruling is pending), some former athletes challenged the NCAA\u2019s strict price controls on labor as antitrust violations that prevent competitive bidding. Amazingly, the NCAA manages to say with a straight face: \u201cMaintaining amateurism is crucial to preserving an academic environment in which acquiring a quality education is the first priority.\u201d To which journalist Patrick Hruby, writing in The Post, responds: \u201cA 2015 survey found that athletes in the Pac-12 Conference spent an average of 50 hours per week on their sports and were often \u2018too exhausted to study effectively.\u2019 \u201d And: \u201cA University of Georgia assistant men\u2019s basketball coach taught a course, mostly for his players, with a final exam that began by asking: \u2018How many goals are there on a basketball court?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe lesson of this tawdry story is that if you graft a multibillion-dollar entertainment industry on to academic institutions, the discordance will leave the latter soiled and the former indulging in shady practices serving the pretense that the industry is somehow something other than it is. The sentencing of the three men convicted last week is set for March 5, two weeks before the 2019 NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament, which CBS and WarnerMedia pay nearly $1 billion a year to televise. It is called March Madness. Actually, the madness is a 12-months-a-year, every-year business.\n\nRead more from George F.

Other times there\u2019ll be no comment at all.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s Oct. 23 scoop on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade was a different beast. This was a juicy story: Kilmeade had made a donation of about $600 to the Trump campaign, though he apparently didn\u2019t realize he was doing so. It was an embarrassing situation, and Kilmeade gave the Hill an on-the-record interview to run through the particulars. No \u201cno comment\u201d here.\n\n\u201cI had no idea that this would be considered a donation,\u201d Kilmeade told the Hill. He\u2019d bought MAGA Christmas ornaments on the Trump campaign website without, apparently, knowing where the money would wind up. The transaction came after Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election victory. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something cool and unique for Christmas for adults after this historic election. \u2026 I had no idea that would go to a campaign contribution,\u201d the Fox News personality said. From the Hill:\n\nKilmeade said he purchased the items through the Trump campaign website. When buying souvenirs on the site, users are given the option to make an additional donation and are notified upon checkout they must enter their occupation as required by federal law for political contributions.\n\nKilmeade told the Hill that he wasn\u2019t about making campaign donations. \u201cEven if I wasn\u2019t in this business, I would never be giving contributions out to people. Especially after an election,\u201d Kilmeade said.\n\nBoneheaded mistakes happen. The Erik Wemple Blog won\u2019t hammer Kilmeade over this matter.\n\nFox News, however, deserves some condemnation. A campaign contribution raises automatic ethical considerations \u2014 which the network dismissed by telling the Hill that it doesn\u2019t \u201cprohibit talent from buying holiday ornaments.\u201d\n\nSo much for journalistic standards!\n\nA coda to the story came out of left field a couple of days after it broke, when Jeremy Barr, who writes on media for the Hollywood Reporter, revealed some information about how the story may have arisen:\n\nThis thread will ring true to media reporters, but may be interesting to readers who want to know how the sausage is made.

But, less than five hours later, The Hill (a largely sympathetic outlet) published a story about the donation, which had gone unreported for more than a year and half. The story included an exclusive interview with Kilmeade.

Was the Hill working on it alongside his own inquiry? Hard to tell, but: Barr says he told Fox News about the donation on Friday, Oct. 19, and allowed the network to figure things out over the weekend. The Hill\u2019s story indicates that Kilmeade \u201cthought nothing of the purchase until Fox made him aware of the donation over the weekend.\u201d\n\nThe Erik Wemple Blog makes a big deal of situations of this sort.

We asked ABC News to assure us that it didn\u2019t steer the exclusive to Politico; we never got that assurance.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing illegal about such tactics, but there is everything slimy about them. We asked Irena Briganti and Carly Shanahan of Fox News PR about Barr\u2019s complaint that he was given off-the-record information and then no response to a request for a statement. Did Fox News play any role in tipping off the Hill? Fox News PR responded by asking to go off the record.\n\nAre you kidding? We haven\u2019t gotten anything on the record.

One is that Fox News PR appears to have tried suppressing the story by telling Barr off the record that Kilmeade hadn\u2019t made a direct cash donation, and that it was an unknowing donation-via-Christmas-decoration kind of thing.\n\nHa: The Christmas decoration angle sweetened this scoop.

He reportedly drove her to a hardware store to buy the supplies she needed to do so, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nAccording to the report, Jennifer Morant suffered from chronic pain, anxiety and depression. She had three life insurance policies worth $1.4 million Australian dollars, of which Graham Morant was the sole beneficiary. She was discovered with a note that said \u201cplease don\u2019t resuscitate me.\u201d\n\nLast month, a jury found Morant guilty of counseling and aiding suicide. The former charge carries a maximum 10-year sentence, which Morant will serve concurrently with the six-year sentence of aiding suicide, according to the BBC.\n\n\u201cYou took advantage of her vulnerability as a sick and depressed woman,\u201d Judge Peter Davis said during the sentencing. \u201cYou counseled your wife to kill herself because you wanted to get your hands on the $1.4 million.\u201d\n\nDavis said that Morant had \u201cnot shown any remorse\u201d for his actions and that his financial status as of 2014 made his sinister intentions even more apparent. Prosecutors allege that Morant was in debt, had limited funds and wanted to spend the money on a religious commune \u201cas a haven from the biblical rapture.\u201d\n\nMorant initially said he had nothing to do with his wife\u2019s suicide, according to ABC. During the trial, Jennifer Morant\u2019s friend Judy Dent said that Jennifer Morant had \u201cmade it clear\" before she died that \"her husband wanted the insurance money.\u201d\n\nDent testified that Jennifer Morant told her: \u201cI have to kill myself and Graham will be helping me.\u201d After the sentencing, Dent told ABC she\u2019d remember Morant for her \u201cbubbly, very full-on, very engaging\u201d personality.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any winners in this situation, and it\u2019s been a long four years,\u201d Dent said.\n\nThe case has parallels with that of a young American woman, Michelle Carter, who was convicted last year in the death of her boyfriend after she\u2019d pushed him to commit suicide through calls and texts.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether a 40-foot cross in the median of a busy suburban Maryland highway is a secular memorial to those who died during World War I or an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion.\n\nThe Peace Cross, made of granite and cement, was built in 1925 as a tribute to local men who died during World War I. It was paid for by local families, businesses and the American Legion. But the giant cross sits on a piece of land that has been owned since 1961 by a state commission that pays for its maintenance and upkeep.\n\nThe challenge to the 93-year-old cross began with the American Humanist Association, a nonprofit atheist organization that has filed similar lawsuits throughout the country. In September, the group won a similar case in which it sought the removal of a 34-foot-tall cross displayed in a city-owned park in Florida.\n\nThe high court has sent mixed messages when it comes to public displays of religion, allowing some monuments with religious content to stand while rejecting others.\n\nIn Maryland, U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow ruled in 2015 that the cross could remain, calling it a historically significant and secular war memorial.\n\n[Judge: War memorial cross not a government endorsement of religion]\n\nShe said there is no indication that the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission\u2019s maintenance of the cross \u201cis driven by a religious purpose,\u201d adding \u201cthe evidence of the commission\u2019s secular purpose is uncontroverted.\u201d\n\nBut a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond disagreed, finding the cross on public land an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion.\n\nThe appeals court ordered the commission to remove, relocate or redesign the memorial.\n\nEven though there are nonreligious elements in the monument, \u201cthe sectarian elements easily overwhelm the secular ones,\u201d wrote Judge Stephanie D.

(N/A/No Credit)\n\nFacebook and Twitter aren\u2019t just trying to drive people to the polls \u2014 they\u2019re racing to fight back bad actors who seek to deter their users from voting.\n\nWith the 2018 midterms days away, both social media platforms are waging a quiet war against fast-spreading falsehoods about how, when and where to vote \u2014 including posts containing inaccuracies about how to mail in ballots or doctored photos that show long lines at polling stations. To do so, they are taking aggressive steps to scan, vet and remove content that they see as a direct threat to democracy.\n\nFor Facebook and Twitter, the challenge is to ensure that false information about voting \u2014 potentially seeded by foreign governments or malicious domestic actors, then amplified by Web users unwittingly \u2014 does not serve to deter or intimidate voters on Nov. 6. Typically, these online giants shy away from correcting or removing false comments on their platforms, arguing that they are not arbiters of truth.\n\n[Trump tweets out \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019-inspired warning to Iran]\n\nFor example, Twitter users in recent weeks have fueled a rumor that federal immigration agents might be stationed at polling places across the country to check voters' citizenship statuses. \u201cI hear ICE agents will be at polling stations on election day, looking to deport illegals trying to vote,\u201d an Oct. 28 tweet said.\n\nThe post, which had gained little traction, was removed after The Washington Post contacted Twitter about it on Thursday. Experts fear such tweets could go viral and scare immigrants who are allowed to vote from casting ballots.

Government officials also stress they are keeping watch, and many state election leaders and voting rights organizations say they have reported problematic posts to the companies.\n\nMonitoring for misleading messages, however, is not an easy task \u2014 and the stakes for tech giants are sky-high after suspicious accounts with possible Russian ties used similar tactics during the 2016 election. On Twitter, they targeted their inaccurate voting information specifically to Hispanic, African American and LGBT voters, according to documents released by congressional lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned there\u2019s going to be misinformation,\u201d said Jim Condos, the secretary of state for Vermont and the leader of the National Association of Secretaries of State.\n\n[Facebook says it has uncovered a coordinated disinformation operation ahead of the 2018 midterm elections]\n\nThe heightened oversight complements the get-out-to-vote reminders and other tools that will be available atop Facebook\u2019s News Feed and Twitter\u2019s timeline come Election Day. On Friday, Twitter announced it would display an election countdown and links to resources for users to learn more about their local candidates. Other companies, such as Snapchat and Spotify, similarly are encouraging their users to vote.\n\nAttempts to depress turnout are hardly new: For decades, government officials have battled back anonymous snail-mail fliers and robo-calls that misled voters on the locations of their polling places or the date of the election. But voter suppression increasingly has become more of a digital scourge \u2014 from robo-texts en masse to viral photos and videos in the age of Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\u201cTechnology has made that information delivery more efficient and cheap, therefore potentially much more widespread,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, the director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. \u201cAnd it has made it more difficult for people to detect.\u201d\n\nFacebook this year has set up a special reporting channel for state election officials to flag voting misinformation for review and removal. Behind the scenes, it also has implemented its machine-learning tools to scan for obviously duplicitous content, including posts that share the wrong date of the election, a company official said Friday.\n\nUnder rules it revised in October, Facebook has banned an even broader swath of content, including posts that wrongly claim that people can vote online. And the company has said it would send some posts \u2014 including incorrect claims about long lines at polling places \u2014 for fact checkers to review, the official added. If they are found to be false, Facebook has said it will limit their reach in users\u2019 news feeds.\n\n\u201cIn the lead up to the midterm elections, we built new tools and invested significant resources in expanding our capacity to take action against voter suppression,\u201d said spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine Barr.\n\nTwitter has adopted a different approach: It has partnered with the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors. Both organizations, along with the Democratic and Republican parties, are supposed to funnel reports of voting disinformation through a Web portal for Twitter employees to review for potential removal, the groups said this week.\n\nCompany executives said they already took down multiple tweets involving immigration agents at polling places. And Twitter confirmed on Friday that it had removed thousands of accounts that had impersonated Democrats\u2019 primary arm for electing candidates to the House of Representatives. Reuters first reported the news.\n\n\u201cIn order to make sure that we are prepared to counter and combat things like attempting to spread mis- or disinformation about elections or voting, or registering to vote . . . we\u2019ve really been trying not just to tighten our policies, but our enforcement capacity,\u201d said Del Harvey, vice president of trust and safety at Twitter.\n\nState-election regulators also have taken advantage of these tools. In Nevada and Oregon, for example, officials flagged tweets that wrongly suggested Democrats are supposed to turn in their ballots on Nov. 7, the day after the election. Twitter has since taken the posts down. Organizations such as NASED reported the tweets, even though they gained limited traction, to prevent the misinformation from going viral \u2014 and because they can\u2019t tell who is behind the posts in the first place.\n\n\"We don\u2019t know on the front end if something is an innocent mistake. We don\u2019t know on the front end if someone thinks they\u2019re being funny. We don\u2019t know on the front end if it\u2019s part of a larger misinformation campaign,\u201d said Amy Cohen, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut we\u2019re focused on addressing the misinformation, regardless of the messenger.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Too easy to manipulate\u2019: Russian disinformation finally costs Facebook and Twitter]\n\nTo state election officials, voting rights advocates and academics, the new systems represent an important start. Those companies also are working alongside the Department of Homeland Security and FBI to monitor online threats. But fears linger that social media companies will not respond quickly enough on Election Day. Other watchdogs fret they have limited visibility into what people are sharing on Facebook, Twitter and other sites in real time. Misinformation can easily spread across social media sites, making it more difficult to track coordinated campaigns.\n\nElection Protection, a coalition of voting rights organizations, said it received a report in recent days about a post on Facebook \u2014 bearing the logo of the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 that was similar to the tweets about ICE agents at polling stations. The group since has shared it with Facebook, which said such posts violate its policies.\n\n\u201cFalsely claiming that ICE or law enforcement will be at polling places is a common voter suppression tactic,\u201d said David Brody, senior fellow for privacy and technology at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the organizations that makes up Election Protection.\n\nIn Vermont, Condos said his state is one of many that lacks the staff, expertise and money to devote an entire team to monitoring election misinformation.\n\n\u201cWe just rely on people contacting us and letting us know,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts stress that it is hard to gauge the broader effects of these posts, tweets and other content on voters\u2019 behaviors \u2014 absent more data. On Facebook, in particular, the site\u2019s efforts to limit the reach of content designed to dissuade voters makes it hard for researchers to track what is happening there.\n\n\u201cRight now, all we see are anecdotes about bad action \u2014 but we have no sense of the prevalence or how effective it might be,\u201d said Nathaniel Persily, a professor at Stanford Law School.\n\nFor social media sites, though, one test came Tuesday, when conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza told more than 1 million followers on Twitter, \u201cFelons can't vote. But pardoned ones can @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Souza previously pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance laws but was pardoned by President Trump this year. His tweet had been shared more than 6,000 times by Friday, and D\u2019Souza posted a similar version on Facebook that picked up more than 2,700 shares.

Bowers. Court records show that the couple divorced in August 1973, just days before Robert Bowers\u2019s first birthday. Authorities have not confirmed that this man is Bowers\u2019s biological father, and the suspected attacker\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nWhen Bowers was as young as 3 or 4 years old, his mother, Barbara, married Robert Saiter in Florida, Saiter said in an interview Thursday.

According to a Pittsburgh Press article at the time, Randall Bowers, then 27, allegedly followed a woman from a pizza shop, got into her car and forced her to drive him to Squirrel Hill \u2014 the same neighborhood that is home to Tree of Life synagogue.\n\nAccording to the article, the suspect threatened to kill the 20-year-old woman and then sexually assaulted her.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, in late April 1979, Randall Bowers \u2014 listed as a \u201claborer\u201d \u2014 was accused of rape along with indecent assault, simple assault and \u201cinvoluntary deviate sexual intercourse.\u201d News accounts from that month state that Bowers was \u201ccaught by Squirrel Hill residents and turned over to police.\u201d\n\nRandall Bowers\u2019s mother, Ann, posted bail, and he was released pending trial, according to court records. A few months later, Randall Bowers was found dead.\n\nCourt files show that Randall Bowers died Oct. 15, 1979, from a gunshot wound to his chest. It was deemed a suicide. A news story nearly two weeks later said he was found \u201cin a picnic area near the Tionesta Dam\u201d after firing a .22-caliber rifle at his chest.\n\nIt was about a month after Robert Bowers\u2019s seventh birthday. It is unclear what, if any, relationship Robert Bowers had with Randall Bowers at the time.\n\nThe coroner's report concluded that Randall Bowers was worried about going to prison and that the motivation for the suicide was \u201cdepression . . . and the belief that he was certain to get jail time\u201d and be injured in prison, according to the current coroner.\n\nA copy of the report was read to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette by Forest County Coroner Norman J. Wimer, the newspaper reported. Wimer confirmed that account to The Washington Post. The coroner\u2019s report stated that the elder Bowers\u2019s body was found underneath a picnic table with antidepressant drugs not far away. Wimer said Randall Bowers had not been seen for about a week when his body was found, and officials determined that he could have been dead for that period.\n\nThe criminal complaint and related records were released Friday by the Allegheny County District Attorney\u2019s Office. Reporters sought the files this week, but the district attorney\u2019s office briefly had them sealed by a judge Thursday so authorities could redact the identity of the victim and witnesses.\n\nRelatives of Randall Bowers could not be reached for comment this week.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThis week, it seems appropriate to make three University of Maryland football players our teachers of the week.\n\nEvery so often, I pick the best or worst teacher of the week from the pool of public figures whose job it is to serve as role models for young people. This week, it was the young people on the College Park campus who taught the adults a lesson.\n\n[Why civil rights leader John Lewis is the best teacher of this truly awful week]\n\nThese three college students \u2014 offensive lineman Ellis McKennie, tight end Avery Edwards and offensive lineman Brendan Moore \u2014 took a stand about something when adult leaders of the university failed to do so in rather spectacular fashion. It couldn\u2019t have been easy for them to do, but they did.\n\nTheir actions came on Tuesday afternoon, after it was revealed that the university\u2019s Board of Regents had rejected a recommendation from the school president, Wallace D. Loh, to part ways with football coach DJ Durkin.\n\nDurkin had been on leave for months after offensive lineman Jordan McNair collapsed at practice and later died of heatstroke. An investigation was launched into allegations that Durkin was running a program with a toxic environment, and Rick Court, the strength and conditioning coach, was dismissed.\n\nIn a decision that the U-Md. community found inexplicable, the regents decided to tell Loh to reinstate Durkin, and Loh announced on Tuesday that he would retire.\n\nThat same afternoon, Durkin met with his football players. McKennie, Edwards and Moore walked out of the meeting in a public protest. This Washington Post story captures some of the drama of the Tuesday meeting:\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 As the stunning news conference that announced the reinstatement of Maryland football Coach DJ Durkin began in downtown Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon, Durkin himself was 30 miles away on campus in College Park, preparing to return to work after 80 days on administrative leave. He arrived at the front of the Gossett Team House on a golf cart with a group of people at 3:30 p.m., walking into the facility while ignoring a reporter who shouted after him to comment. That afternoon, Durkin addressed his team for the first time since he was placed on leave Aug. 11 in the aftermath of offensive lineman Jordan McNair\u2019s death in June and as part of an investigation into the culture of his program. According to multiple people with knowledge of the situation, three players walked out of the meeting Tuesday, underscoring the deep uncertainty that Durkin\u2019s return will bring. Some players and staff members were stunned by Durkin\u2019s return, and some program insiders wondered how he would regain his footing as the program\u2019s leader and continue to recruit prospective players in the wake of McNair\u2019s death and allegations of abuse.\n\nA day later, with protests in the U-Md. growing, Loh fired Durkin on Wednesday. Not long after, the chairman of the Board of Regents resigned.\n\nMcKennie and other players, as well as many others associated with the university, went on Twitter to talk about what happened:\n\nMembers of the UMD Student Government Association were taking turns slamming Durkin and the Board of Regents during their Wednesday night meeting.

It has run war games to anticipate threats and set up a round-the-clock operation so teams can react quickly to incidents such as targeted hate speech \u2014 which happened in the recent Brazilian election.\n\n[As midterms approach, a growing concern that the nation is not protected from Russian interference]\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, which in summer 2016 was hacked by Russian spies, has moved all email to the \u201ccloud,\u201d runs regular spear-phishing tests on employees and has mandated that everyone use an encrypted chat app to send messages to one another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sleeping,\u201d said Raffi Krikorian, DNC chief technology officer. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely stressed and extremely concerned any sophisticated attack would fly under our radar. So every day that nothing happens is a day we\u2019re stressed out of our minds because we\u2019re trying to figure out, \u2018What are we missing right now?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe FBI and DHS have set up task forces on foreign influence. U.S. Cyber Command has signaled directly to Russian trolls and hackers that they had better not interfere. The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on Russians accused of election interference. Perhaps of most significance, the Justice Department has criminally charged more than two dozen Russian trolls, spies and operatives for seeking to interfere in U.S. elections, including one last month in connection with the midterms, which have raised public awareness of Russia\u2019s tactics and its overarching goal: To amplify divisions in American society and undermine U.S. democracy.\n\n[Russian troll farm, 13 suspects indicted in election interference]\n\nIndeed, a major threat to election security and democracy is a deeply polarized society, said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n\u201cWhen we have political leadership that is fanning flames of division, they are making us much more vulnerable to external impact,\u201d said Rosenberger, a former National Security Council official in the Obama administration. \u201cUntil we have both political leadership and broader civil society activity to address some of those real divisions in the country, these are going to be vulnerabilities that are ripe for exploitation.\u201d\n\nStill, on election infrastructure, the trend overall is toward improvement, officials say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re miles ahead of where we were in 2016,\u201d said Matt Masterson, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s point person on election security. \u201cThe work we\u2019ve been able to do with our state and local partners has improved the resilience and security across all 50 states.\u201d\n\nThe most important difference between then and now, officials said, is communication: between the federal government and state and local officials, between law enforcement and social media companies, and between the public and private sectors and voters.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, DHS made a conscious effort to talk to state chief information officers, but those officers weren\u2019t always talking to state election officials,\u201d said Thomas Hicks, chairman of the Election Assistance Commission, an independent bipartisan panel created after the Florida election debacle of 2000 to improve election administration. \u201cThey weren\u2019t alerting the right people of the threats.\u201d\n\nBut now they are, in part thanks to a \u201cgovernment coordinating council,\u201d formed with the commission\u2019s help, that expedites information-sharing to help election officials learn about security threats quickly.\n\nIn late 2016 and early 2017, DHS was eyed warily by some states, which feared its plan to designate elections systems as part of the nation\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d was a play to extend federal authority.\n\nBut today, the critical infrastructure designation is accepted, and all 50 states as well as more than 1,000 local jurisdictions take part in a communications channel run by the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center \u00ad[EI-ISAC], a federally funded body set up in 2017. That includes the state of Georgia, whose secretary of state, Brian Kemp, was an outspoken critic of federal assistance in 2016.\n\n[Security officials tell states: Keep calm, and trust the feds on Election Day]\n\nEvery Friday for the past several weeks, DHS has held a conference call with 80 to 100-plus election officials, often with participation by the FBI and representatives of election machine vendors, to update them on what threatening activity they\u2019re seeing. \u201cEven if it\u2019s to say we have nothing new to report, they know we\u2019re regularly checking in with them,\u201d Masterson said.\n\nA number of states have hired more cybersecurity staff or outside vendors to help them, 43 have installed monitors to enable DHS to watch traffic for threats, and almost half have had DHS conduct risk and vulnerability assessments.\n\nBut there are still 13 states using in some or all districts electronic touch-screen machines that are vulnerable to hacking, said Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Democracy Program. There are no federal standards for election infrastructure other than voting machines \u2014 and those standards are voluntary. There is little insight into whom voting machine vendors hire or their security practices.\n\n\u201cThose are really big areas where we need to be a lot more focused in the next year or two,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if no machines are hacked, experts fear the Russians \u2014 or some other mischief-maker \u2014 could claim they had hacked into a machine and altered votes, causing confusion.\n\nThat\u2019s why states have been coached by DHS and national election official associations to be prepared to correct the record promptly.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s intentional disinformation or inadvertent misinformation, we respond,\u201d Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams said. \u201cWe monitor social media. We work with our media very well here, and we try to get out accurate information.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe social media firms that bore the brunt of the Russian assault have acted more aggressively since 2016 to patrol their platforms. Facebook since 2017 has removed thousands of pages, groups and accounts linked to Russia and Iran from its platforms, including Instagram \u2014 accounts engaged in \u201cinauthentic\u201d behavior of the sort that might indicate an effort to sow discord.\n\nWith China, said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen the kind of coordinated information operations that we have from other states.\u201d\n\nFacebook has taken measures to make fake accounts harder to create and easier to detect. The Russians and others \u201cneed to be more concealed in their identities, which forces them to be more disciplined, which forces them to screw up,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nWhile the vast majority of divisive and inauthentic content is domestic, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve also seen indications of foreign actors seeding material, which domestic actors don\u2019t realize [is of foreign origin] and pick up.\u201d\n\nHe said the coordination with the FBI has improved since 2016, when the bureau was not sharing information it had received indicating Russians setting up troll accounts.

(John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nMilitary planners anticipate that only a small percentage of Central American migrants traveling in the caravans President Trump characterizes as \u201can invasion\u201d will reach the U.S. border, even as a force of more than 7,000 active-duty troops mobilizes to prevent them from entering the United States.\n\nAccording to military planning documents, about 20 percent of the roughly 7,000 migrants traveling through Mexico are likely to complete the journey. The unclassified report was obtained and published by Newsweek on Thursday. If the military\u2019s assessment is accurate, it would mean the United States is positioning five soldiers on the border for every one caravan member expected to arrive there.\n\n\u201cBased on historic trends, it is assessed that only a small percentage of the migrants will likely reach the border,\u201d the report says. It was prepared by U.S. Army North, a component of U.S. Northern Command, which oversees the mission dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot.\n\nThe assessment also indicates military planners are concerned about the presence of \u201cunregulated armed militia\u201d groups showing up at the border in areas where U.S. troops will operate.\n\nThe Washington Post was unable to independently confirm the report\u2019s authenticity. Reached Friday, military officials did not dispute its veracity but declined to address questions about its contents.\n\n[Migrant caravan: What Trump\u2019s threats sound like to the Central Americans trudging north]\n\nSeizing on immigration as his main campaign theme ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, Trump has depicted the caravans \u2014 at least four have formed, though they remain hundreds of miles away \u2014 as a grave danger to U.S. national security, claiming they are composed of \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d hardened criminals and \u201cvery tough fighters.\u201d He also insists the number of migrants heading north is much larger than estimates put forward by U.S. and Mexican governmentofficials.\n\nThe military assessment does not support any of those claims.\n\nThe report, dated Oct. 27, notes that caravan members are unlikely to arrive for at least two to four weeks. Among those traveling are \u201climited #s of Bangladeshi, Haitian and African individuals,\u201d it reads. It makes no mention of Middle Eastern countries.\n\nHomeland Security officials say they have identified 270 individuals in the caravan with \u201ccriminal histories, including known gang membership.\u201d In a statement, the department also said foreign nationals from 20 countries are among the groups, though none of the nations it listed are in the Middle East.\n\n[Border deployment puts Mattis and the military in political crosshairs]\n\nIn the military planners\u2019 most likely scenario, the caravans will continue to dwindle in size as they move north with \u201cno terrorist infiltration,\u201d potentially causing a \u201cballoon effect\u201d on smuggling activity as traffickers attempt to exploit the diversion created by Trump\u2019s focus on the migrants.\n\nIn its \u201cmost dangerous\u201d assessment, the caravan would \u201cgrow markedly\u201d and become exploited by terrorists and traffickers, leading to increasing \u201ccross border engagements.\u201d The assessment does not assign a numerical probability to those scenarios.\n\nTrump said this week that he wants to send as many as 15,000 troops to the border to prepare for the caravans. The deployment appears to be the largest such peacetime mobilization of active-duty U.S. troops at the border in at least a century.\n\n[Trump\u2019s 15,000 border troops would top the number stationed in 160 countries]\n\nHigh on the list of potential dangers facing U.S. personnel, according to the military\u2019s assessment, is the presence of \u201cunregulated militia members self-deploying to the border in alleged support\u201d of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It estimates that 200 militia members could show up while troops are in the area.\n\n\u201cThey operate under the guise of citizen patrols,\u201d the report reads, warning of \u201cincidents of unregulated militias stealing National Guard equipment during deployments.\u201d\n\nThe assessment does not go into further detail about those incidents, but Border Patrol officials have also warned landowners in the area about the possibility of gun-carrying militias on their property in the coming weeks.\n\nProtesters and \u201canarchists\u201d arriving along the border also pose a risk, according to the report. \u201cPrevious protests in support of immigration caravans or enforcement of immigration law have occurred throughout the U.S.,\u201d it says. \u201cNormally peaceful unless extreme right or left groups attend.\u201d\n\nDan Lamothe contributed to this report.", "", "The long-alleged n-word tape still hasn\u2019t surfaced. But yet another person who has been close to President Trump is accusing him of using racist language.\n\nIn a new interview with Vanity Fair, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recalls four explicit instances of Trump saying racist things about black people:\n\n\u201cBlack people are too stupid to vote for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cName one country run by a black person that\u2019s not a shithole. Name one city.\"\n\nWhile traveling through a Chicago neighborhood: \u201cOnly the blacks could live like this.\u201d\n\nOn a black finalist on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can let this black f-g win.\u201d\n\nAll the usual caveats apply here. Cohen is now a felon who has turned on Trump, both legally and politically. He has implicated Trump in a campaign finance violation and has rejoined the Democratic Party. He\u2019s got an ax to grind and no actual proof of this; it\u2019s all hearsay. And an election that is largely a referendum on Trump is happening in four days.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth emphasizing how increasingly believable this is, both in the context of Trump\u2019s public actions and what others have said about him. There is now a fast-growing list of racially charged things Trump has said and done \u2014 the most recent being a Willie Horton-style ad this week \u2014 and there\u2019s also a growing list people close to him arguing and believing he has said racist things.\n\nThat\u2019s not just coming from those now opposed to Trump, such as Cohen and Omarosa Manigault Newman, who accused Trump of using the n-word after falling out with Trump and publishing a book this summer. So have two additional black \u201cApprentice\u201d contestants \u2014 Randall Pinket and now Kwame Jackson, who confirmed to Vanity Fair that he had heard about Trump making such a comment. And Manigault Newman, you may recall, also shared a secret recording in which other black Trump staffers seemed to grant that Trump probably had, in fact, used the n-word.\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript of that tape:\n\nKATRINA PIERSON: I\u2019m trying to find out at least what context it was used in to help us maybe try to figure out a way to spin it. LYNNE PATTON: I said, \"Well, sir, can you think of any time that this might have happened, and he said, \u201cNo\u201d. MANIGAULT NEWMAN: Well, that\u2019s not true. So \u2014 PATTON: He goes, \u201cHow do you think I should handle it?\u201d and I told him exactly what you just said, Omarosa \u2014 which is, well, it depends on what scenario you are talking about. And he said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just go ahead and put it to bed.\u201d (CROSSTALK) PIERSON: He said it. No, he said it. He\u2019s embarrassed.\n\nPierson has since said that she was just agreeing with Manigault Newsman\u2019s premise to placate her. But other denials offered by her and Patton have fallen apart. And multiple White House spokesmen declined to explicitly rule out the existence of the n-word tape, perhaps because they worried it might one day surface and render them liars.\n\nThe comments from Cohen track with all of that and basically everything we know about Trump. Pierson and Patton seemed to believe Trump said it, but that perhaps the context wasn\u2019t as damning as it could be. Cohen isn\u2019t accusing Trump of using the n-word but of ascribing racist stereotypes to African Americans.\n\nThe comments themselves also sound like things Trump has said and reportedly said.\n\nAs to the first one, he has called other people who didn\u2019t vote for him \u2014 Iowans, specifically \u2014 \u201cstupid\u201d for not doing so.\n\nOn No. 2, there was the time he referred to largely black nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d in the White House. He even did that in front of a Democratic senator.\n\nThe third one sounds a lot like when Trump repeatedly as a 2016 candidate implored black voters to support him by citing their plight and saying, \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d Trump has repeatedly alluded to the poor status of African Americans as a reason they should support him.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Cohen, if he did indeed make all this up, knows Trump well enough that he made the quotes sound believable based upon things Trump already said. It\u2019s also possible Manigault Newman was making things up for publicity. It\u2019s also possible Pierson didn\u2019t believe the tape existed and that White House spokesmen aren\u2019t really concerned that it exists.\n\nBut all of that, combined with Trump\u2019s increasingly unapologetic use of racially divisive rhetoric, makes it difficult to dismiss Cohen\u2019s allegation out of hand.", "", "The fishermen believed that the humpback whale, already struggling to shake off a rope cinched to its massive body, would be even more bewildered by a boat ejecting humans into the water.\n\nNicholas Taron and Sam Synstelien needed a way to communicate a simple message to the whale: We want to free you.\n\nThe crew blasted the volume on the radio and transmitted loud messages into the waters off the central California coast as the whale swam in panicked circles, as if tethered to the seafloor.\n\n\u201cWe were saying to the whale, \u2018We\u2019re your only hope. No one is coming here. You\u2019re either going to let Sam jump on you \u2014 or you\u2019re on your own,\u2019 \u201d Taron told The Washington Post on Friday.\n\nThe whale\u2019s life was potentially in danger. Netting and ropes can exhaust and drown giant sea mammals, experts have said, or cause wounds that attract sharks.\n\nHumpback whales can grow as long as 60 feet and weigh up to 40 tons, according to National Geographic. Taron\u2019s boat, by contrast, is 27 feet long.\n\nThis particular whale, though, seemed to understand the message it received as it drifted in the water, Taron said.\n\nSome of the ropes caught on the end of the animal\u2019s powerful, notched tail were tied to a buoy. The men cut the lines, and a few slipped free.\n\nBut someone still needed to release one last rope tightening on the whale\u2019s back, the men decided.\n\n[How researchers rescued a \u2018hog-tied\u2019 humpback whale from death by shark]\n\nThey had stayed with the whale for more than two hours, Taron said, and radioed the Coast Guard and called the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for help.\n\nIt may take awhile for a responding unit to arrive, Taron said a responding Coast Guard official told him over the radio, before asking for the two fishermen\u2019s last coordinate and suggesting they could be \u201cdismissed\u201d from the area.\n\nAn unidentified bystander on the radio channel suggested they dive in, Taron said.\n\nBut the fishermen are not whale rescuers. They harvest monstrous-looking hagfish, also known as slime eels, for the clouds of ooze they emit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re totally not qualified for this,\u201d Taron said, referring to rescuing whales that can grow longer than a school bus.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nSynstelien surveyed the water, the whale and the constricting blue rope. He hesitated for a moment.\n\n\u201cGet it, Sam. Jump on the whale right now and cut it!\u201d Taron yelled, in video he took of the incident and posted Sept. 27.\n\nSynstelien leaped, blade in hand, into the cold water off Morro Bay.\n\nThe whale\u2019s blowhole erupted in a dry shriek as Synstelien made his way to its dorsal fin. He climbed aboard, holding the rope on its slick body like a bull rider.\n\n\u201cGet it, get it. Before she dives!\u201d Taron called out.\n\n\n\nA humpback whale off Colombia. (Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSynstelien held his grip. The rope was tight and difficult to maneuver under, \u201clike a piece of floss around your arm,\u201d Taron explained.\n\nSynstelien slid his hand in and sliced the rope away. At the same moment, the whale\u2019s tail rose from the water and struck the side of the boat. Taron let out a groan. He had almost dropped his caseless cellphone into the water.\n\nTaron panned to find his partner bobbing nearby. \u201cDid you get it?\u201d he asked.\n\nSynstelien held the knife in his teeth and raised his arms in triumph. \u201cYeeeah!\u201d Taron roared in the video.\n\n\u201cWe were psyched,\u201d Taron recalled. He does not know why a month-old video has only recently gained prominence, though he speculated it circulated on social media until news outlets began to notice.\n\nOfficials warned it was perhaps not the right way to deal with a trapped whale.\n\nThe incident could have gone a lot worse, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney, a spokesman for regional operations.\n\nThe whale could have rolled on top of Synstelien, the rope could have tangled him too, or the whale could have crushed him against the boat, Barney said.\n\n[Overturned truck of \u2018slime eels\u2019 transforms Oregon road into highway of nightmares]\n\n\u201cAll kinds of things could have gone wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nIt has turned tragic for professionals in that actual line of work. Joe Howlett, a Canadian fisherman with 15 years experience freeing entangled whales off the Canadian coast, was killed during one such operation to free a right whale last year.\n\nNOAA, which confirmed the whale was a humpback, appeared to refer to the death and others like it in a statement, saying people have been killed in similar incidents.\n\nThe agency said it is relieved there were no injuries, but it is worried the video could give civilians the same idea of undertaking a dangerous mission usually performed by trained responders using specialized equipment.\n\n\u201cBest practice for dealing with an entangled whale is to never get into the water with it, as these animals are very powerful and dangerous in close proximity,\u201d NOAA Fisheries West Coast Region spokesman Jim Milbury said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, every entangled whale is not necessarily in imminent danger, meaning that there is time to wait for the authorized responders and not requiring these types of emergency actions. And cutting just the visible lines may not totally free the animal, making it harder for responders to help,\u201d he added.\n\nThat danger was not lost on the crew, Taron said. Both he and Synstelien attended years of schooling for a marine transportation license and regularly encounter sea life. The whale was massive, and they understood it could have killed them even while on the boat.\n\nBut Taron and Synstelien felt they had to do something. \u201cWe were trying to help out a friendly giant,\u201d Taron said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTwo generations of humans have killed off more than half the world\u2019s wildlife populations, report finds\n\nHow dogs could help eradicate malaria", "Oddly, Nick Saban never seems to project the type of monster ego often necessary to lasso the kinds of stupendous feats he has wreaked in the American Southeast. If it lurks in there somewhere, it expresses itself quietly or in private company. Yet if he looked across the Southeastern Conference this weekend, which he won\u2019t, and he lost control of himself, which he won\u2019t, he could run the risk of unbearableness.\n\nOn one of those college football weekends with too much of too much, No. 1 Alabama will visit No. 3 LSU in the annual clash of large lads right after No. 6 Georgia visits No. 9 Kentucky in a fresh doozy, with Saban such a towering Rushmore figure that he turns up in the plot of all four combatants, even if in one case the appearance was fleeting but telling.\n\n[The college football games you need to watch this weekend]\n\nHe coaches Alabama (well). He used to coach LSU (well). His influence over Georgia looks obvious. He\u2019s a curious part of Kentucky\u2019s history.\n\nHe\u2019s such a big platelet in the bloodstream of Alabama-LSU that he has bent its recent trajectory as his bent in discussing it has become predictable: It seemed obvious he might start this week by casting Alabama\u2019s seven straight wins over LSU as irrelevant, and he started this week by casting Alabama\u2019s seven straight wins over LSU as irrelevant.\n\n\u201cOur record or any other statistic that you guys want to sort of bring up about all this game and all that will not affect the outcome of this game at all,\u201d he said in Tuscaloosa as if some imperious inner clock told him to do so.\n\nHis dominant team has played defenses ranked, in yards per play, Nos. 110, 108, 109, 100, 120, 94, 90 and 98 \u2014 playing Alabama did not help those rankings, of course \u2014 while LSU ranks 23rd. And considering Alabama scores 54.1 points per game while LSU allows 15.1 and considering quarterback Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s touchdowns-to-interceptions ratio (25-0) is itself an impossible football sonnet, it\u2019s all about whether LSU can match the Saban standard.\n\n\u201cBut, you know, we have some good defensive backs,\u201d LSU Coach Ed Orgeron said. \u201cWe lead the country in interceptions [14, in a tie with Fresno State and Maryland ]. I think we match up well with them.\u201d\n\n[In grief and in defiance, the Terps\u2019 line holds]\n\nLSU seeks this standard knowing Saban began learning to set it with his 48-16 run at LSU from 2000 to 2004, including the 2003 national championship, which means the SEC began its long tilt toward Sabanistan on Tuesday, Nov. 30, 1999, when LSU hired him from Michigan State, and he began learning the league as he noted this week.\n\nWith the league learned by 2015, his Alabama team would make one of its occasional trips to Athens, Ga., stomp to a 24-3 halftime lead and win, 38-10. That game shouted that while Georgia was generally very good, it lacked whatever extra notch Alabama had, a notch it has obtained since.\n\nParticipating in a 2010s fashion trend two months later, Georgia hired a nine-year Saban assistant, Kirby Smart, who had the handy credential of also having played for Georgia. Through its 21 wins in its past 24 games, it has called to mind Saban more than once in the way it goes about its business and moves around on defense. That makes it an ideal visitor to assist with Kentucky\u2019s newfound self-measurement.\n\nAround Lexington, fans have had themselves a giddy autumn after spending decades honing the fine art of sensing doom prowling just around the corner. On a team that has not lost in regulation, they have watched a marvel of a defense allow only one team (Central Michigan) 20 points in regulation. More appealingly, they have seen their team (7-1) win the kind of games it used to botch as if some ancient curse that appeared from some ancient tomb has up and expired.\n\nKentucky led Florida 21-10 in the fourth quarter on Sept. 8 the same way it led it 27-14 last year, but instead of losing inevitably, it spent the dreaded last play getting Josh Allen\u2019s sack and Davonte Robinson\u2019s 30-yard fumble return. It trailed Missouri 14-3 with six minutes left last week but won 15-14 on a punt return and a closing, eight-play, 81-yard drive remarkable for its inclusion of two sacks, the inexorable crushers Kentucky fans have come to expect. Even in the 20-14 overtime loss at Texas A&M, the Wildcats made a play that forged the kind of break seldom found in their history: Derrick Baity\u2019s strip, a skittering football and Darius West\u2019s 40-yard fumble return for a tying touchdown.\n\nRunning back Benny Snell Jr., one of those youths for whom attention is not a burden, wrote in the Players Tribune about how he got curious in Missouri about the reaction in Lexington, thus checked Twitter. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was just tons of kids in the middle of State Street. Everyone\u2019s jumping and dancing and yelling. All for . . . a football win. In Lexington. Incredible.\u201d\n\nTons of kids couldn\u2019t remember the ways in which Kentucky became arguably the nation\u2019s leading football harbor of strange excruciation. It has lost when Tulane went 87 yards in 12 seconds on two interference penalties that arranged a field goal, when Kentucky ran four plays from the 5-yard line at Tennessee (all runs by one back, Mark Higgs), when Florida threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open receiver with three seconds left, when a linebacker made a Peach Bowl-clinching interception, then ran and fumbled it.\n\nAll those things formed an expectation of same, lodged in the minds of witnesses through such admirable downers as the 52-50 overtime loss to Tennessee in 2007 or the 36-30 overtime loss to Florida in 2014, a high pile of glumness that magnifies what Kentucky accomplishes now. Yet it all found an epitome Nov. 9, 2002, which might well remain the only game in which a coach got a Gatorade shower, then lost.\n\nAs Kentucky fans edged toward storming the field and its athletic director gave congratulatory handshakes (understandably), LSU\u2019s 75-yard touchdown pass from Marcus Randall to Devery Henderson with two seconds left became one of the weirdest endings in college football history. Three Kentucky players touched the ball along its way. It descended around the 25-yard line and got collected at the 18, yet Henderson still scored.\n\nWrote Jim Kleinpeter in the New Orleans Times-Picayune: \u201cA play that never works for LSU in practice, one the Tigers ran incorrectly Saturday, might go down as the most astounding in the school\u2019s 110-year football history.\u201d In the Sunday Advocate of Baton Rouge, Scott Rabalais told of two Kentucky fans standing on the crossbar ready for goal-post toppling, when one said to the other, \u201cDid we just lose this game?\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s turn for comment to the winning coach from that telltale game, who had just seen a daydream play yet managed to say with hilarious dullness, \u201cWe always say we need to play 60 minutes.

You\u2019re creating violence by your questions,\u201d Trump said, pointing at her.\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cYou are creating \u2014 you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also a lot of the reporters are creating violence by not writing the truth.\"\n\n\u201cThe fake news is creating violence,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cAnd you know what? The people that support Trump and the people that support us \u2014 which is a lot of people; most people; many people \u2014 those people know when a story is true, and they know when a story is false. And I\u2019ll tell you what. If the media would write correctly and write accurately and write fairly, you\u2019d have a lot less violence in the country.\u201d\n\nTravers\u2019s question appears to have stemmed from a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Friday. We found that 49 percent of Americans believed that Trump\u2019s rhetoric did, in fact, encourage violence. Perhaps unsurprisingly, far more Democrats (more than three-quarters) hold that position than Republicans. About half of independents said they believed that Trump\u2019s rhetoric encouraged violence.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut then, Trump is a typical Republican in that he accuses the media of encouraging violence. Our poll also found that a bit less than half the country said the media encouraged violence, with more than two-thirds of Republicans and half of independents agreeing with that idea. (Most Democrats said the media neither encouraged nor discouraged violence.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThis sentiment is of a piece with Trump\u2019s long-standing excoriation of the media as the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d While earlier this week he attempted to say that only \u201cfake news\u201d earned that title, he has made clear repeatedly that he means coverage that isn\u2019t entirely positive.\n\nAfter Trump defended his pugnacious approach to the media in an interview this week, Ainsley Earhardt \u2014 one of the hosts of Trump\u2019s go-to morning news show, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d \u2014 defended the president.\n\nIt \u201chas to be frustrating,\u201d she said, when the media report something that\u2019s \u201ccompletely different than what you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he is calling it fake news,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s saying if you don\u2019t want to be called the enemy, then get the story right, be accurate and report the story the way I want it reported.\u201d That last part, included intentionally or not, is certainly accurate.\n\nAt a rally in Florida on Wednesday, Trump made a similar case.\n\n\u201cWe have forcefully condemned hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice in all of its ugly forms, but the media doesn\u2019t want you to hear your story. It\u2019s not my story. It\u2019s your story,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why 33 percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is, in fact \u2014 and I hate to say this \u2014 in fact, the enemy of the people.\"\n\nThat data point comes from polling by Quinnipiac University. The bulk of those who agreed with the statement were Republicans. Trump\u2019s condemnations of divisiveness are also best considered in a broader context.\n\n\u201cThe left-wing media doesn\u2019t want to solve problems,\u201d Trump continued at the rally. \u201cThey want to stoke resentment.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly argued that his efforts to unify the country are impeded by the media\u2019s reporting. It\u2019s fair to note that opposition to the president is heavily a function of partisanship, a powerful force that Trump often leverages to his own benefit. Much of it also stems from Trump\u2019s near-exclusive advocacy for issues focused on his fervent base of support and from his affection for publicly disparaging his opponents.\n\nWhat\u2019s important about the new Post-ABC poll is how readily Republicans accept the idea that it\u2019s the media that are responsible for encouraging violence. Critical reporting on Trump is viewed as unfair and therefore divisive and, apparently, therefore a step toward political violence. Americans should want a critical press, but Trump has effectively leveraged long-standing antipathy to the media (especially on the right) to suggest that reporting should be broadly dismissed. Now, explicitly: that this reporting leads to violent places.\n\nThat this is a dangerous argument to reinforce should be obvious. Ironically, this disparagement of the media as fomenting violence may itself be an example of Trump ramping up dangerous rhetoric. (Ten percent of Republicans in our poll thought that both Trump and the media encourage violence.)\n\nHow the media bear blame for the mail bombs or the synagogue shooting is not clear, much less to the exclusion of Trump. A reporter present for the president\u2019s comment to Travers seemed similarly baffled.\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d he asked. How was it that the media encouraged violence?\n\nTrump didn\u2019t respond.", "", "\n\nAnderson Cooper attends the Turner Upfront 2017 at The Theater at Madison Square Garden on May 17, 2017, in New York. (Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMedia critic\n\nOn his Thursday night show, CNN host Anderson Cooper turned his attention to President Trump\u2019s attempt to instill fear in the hearts of his fellow citizens by pointing to a caravan of migrants slowly making its way north through Mexico. Said Cooper: \u201cThe question tonight is, does what the president talked about today, the caravan in Mexico and the asylum process, rise to the level of a crisis that requires thousands of American troops to rush to the border? Or does a fast-approaching election have more to do with what he said today than slow-walking asylum seekers? How you answer that question may depend [on] how you view the president\u2019s truthfulness.\u201d\n\nWith pointed language, Cooper corrected Trump on his suggestion \u2014 \u201cA lot of people say yes,\u201d said the president \u2014 that philanthropist George Soros could well be orchestrating the caravan. He corrected Trump\u2019s claim that there could be as many as 20 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. (There are 12 million, a number that Trump also mentioned). He corrected Trump\u2019s claim that he was merely continuing the Obama administration\u2019s policy of separating children from their families at the border (not true: Trump routinized the practice before an outcry forced him to retreat). He corrected Trump\u2019s claim that 3 percent of asylum seekers appear for court hearings. (It\u2019s actually 75 percent, according to Trump\u2019s own Justice Department).\n\nAnd he chided Trump for bragging of his expertise at judging crowd size: \u201cI\u2019m pretty good at estimating crowd size, and [the caravans] look a lot bigger than people would think,\u201d said Trump. Countered Cooper: \u201cOf all the claims for this president to make, do we need to get into the whole crowd size thing with this president? I mean, do we?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a template. Each day there are any number of topics floating around in the news: immigration, the economy, the climate, trade and so on. The one thing they all have in common is the falsehoods and the lies that the president peddles in talking about these topics. Mendacity is the cross-cutting issue of contemporary America, the fissile material that\u2019s blasting our political process to shreds. Coverage of the \u201cissues,\u201d therefore, is impossible without first addressing this issue.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason why any cable-news show, any nightly news broadcast shouldn\u2019t start with just the sort of factual pat-down that Cooper did on Thursday night. As previously discussed in this space, there\u2019s a surfeit of material along these lines, as Trump\u2019s lying loquacity is racing ahead of the country\u2019s fact-checking corps. As the country heads around the corner to the 2020 presidential campaign, this particular mismatch promises to become more lopsided.\n\nThe problem multiplies with the assistance of Trump\u2019s lieutenants. Speaking of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo told Vanity Fair, \u201cShe\u2019ll say three things in a row that need a correction. She\u2019s really, really good.\u201d\n\nAsked by ABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl if he\u2019s always been truthful, Trump actually had trouble lying: \u201cI do try, and I always want to tell the truth when I can. I tell the truth. I mean, sometimes it turns out to be, where something happens, it\u2019s different or there\u2019s a change, but I always like to be truthful.\u201d\n\nCooper asked, \u201cThat is the president of the United States telling ABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl that he tells the truth when he can, which raises the obvious question: When can he not tell the truth? For most presidents, the answer is very, very rarely, usually [to] safeguard some greater secret which might compromise national security if it got out.\u201d\n\nHBO\u2019s Bill Maher put it well when he interviewed Fox News\u2019s Geraldo Rivera about his buddy Trump. \u201cBut just \u2014 the lying. It doesn\u2019t bother you \u2014 the lying on a scale we\u2019ve never seen?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nErik Wemple: \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 anchor accidentally confirms show\u2019s mission: Propaganda\n\nErik Wemple: MSNBC blows off Trump\u2019s immigration fearmongering address", "Maureen Pacheco had expected to have a spinal procedure.\n\nIt was April 2016, and she was told a surgeon would fuse together a couple of vertebrae in her lower back to help relieve pain believed to be from an injury she sustained in a car accident the previous year. However, when she woke up from surgery at Wellington Regional Medical Center in Wellington, Fla., she learned that the surgeon had done something else, according to court records.\n\nDuring the spinal procedure, the surgeon, Ramon Vazquez, had allegedly noticed a mass in Pacheco\u2019s pelvis, suspected that it was a cancerous tumor and cut it out, according to an administrative complaint from the Florida Department of Health.\n\nIt turned out it wasn\u2019t a tumor.\n\nIt was one of Pacheco\u2019s kidneys.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, when someone goes in for a back surgery, she would never expect to wake up and be told when she\u2019s just waking up from anesthesia, that one of her kidneys has been unnecessarily removed,\u201d Pacheco\u2019s attorney, Donald Ward, told the Palm Beach Post. Ward could not immediately be reached by The Washington Post.\n\n['Damaged for the rest of my life\u2019: Woman says surgeons mistakenly removed her breasts and uterus]\n\nPacheco sued the surgeon last year, claiming that Vazquez and others were medically negligent when Vazquez \u201cunnecessarily removed\u201d a \u201cfully functioning\u201d kidney. The kidney, which was on Pacheco\u2019s left side, was a pelvic kidney, meaning that during fetal development, it did not ascend to its normal position in the upper abdominal area, according to the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled in September for \u201ca nominal amount,\u201d the surgeon\u2019s lawyer, Michael Mittelmark, told The Post. However, Mittelmark said that his client did not admit liability and \u201cdoes not think he did anything wrong.\u201d\n\nVazquez is a general surgeon in West Palm Beach. According to the state\u2019s Board of Medicine, he has an active license with no record of discipline on file.\n\nWellington Regional Medical Center said in a statement Friday that, at the time, Vazquez was an independent physician with privileges at the hospital but \u201cis not and has never been an employee.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Vazquez is no longer on the medical staff of Wellington Regional,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWellington Regional took all necessary and appropriate steps to review the circumstances of this most unfortunate incident. In the over-30-year history of Wellington Regional Medical Center, an incident of this nature has never occurred before or since.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s better to have two functional kidneys, most people can live normal lives with only one, according to the National Kidney Foundation. However, in some cases, having only one can lead to problems later in life, such as an increased risk of high blood pressure.\n\nLeading up to the spinal surgery, Pacheco had undergone two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests, which revealed she had a kidney located in her pelvic region, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit stated that on April 29, 2016, Pacheco was preparing to undergo the spinal surgery when Vazquez met with her for the first time and told her that \u201che would be performing surgery that would expose the surgical site\u201d and then two other surgeons would perform the planned procedure. However, the lawsuit said that during the procedure, Vazquez \u201cdeviated from the acceptable standards of medical care and treatment,\u201d by failing to perform a \u201cradiology review\u201d or even inform Pacheco before removing one of her organs.\n\nAs a result, according to the lawsuit, Pacheco has suffered \u201cbodily injury and resulting pain and suffering, disability, disfigurement\u201d as well as \u201cmental anguish.\u201d\n\nIn December, the Florida Department of Health filed a complaint against Vazquez to the Florida Board of Medicine, stating that Pacheco\u2019s pelvic kidney had nothing to do with the condition for which she was being treated, meaning that it was \u201ca medically unnecessary procedure.\u201d\n\nThe health department requested that the board consider suspending or revoking the surgeon\u2019s medical license or put him on probation.\n\nRead more:\n\nDoctors started brain surgery \u2014 then realized they were operating on the wrong patient\n\nA surgeon is suspended for operating on the wrong patient \u2014 and his colleagues go on strike", "", "Opinion writer\n\nThe man who allegedly murdered 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue hated refugees and American Jews with what appears to be equivalent intensity. Before apparently carrying out the massacre, he unleashed hate-filled diatribes directed at both.\n\nA Jewish organization that helps immigrants, the man raged, \u201clikes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201d He added that Jews \u201clike to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted before, this sort of xenophobic right wing nativist nationalism has several key ingredients. There\u2019s the scapegoating of out-groups below, such as the dark hordes of migrants now being hyped by President Trump, who are eager to infest and undermine the \u201creal\u201d American people. But that\u2019s not enough on its own. You also need a \u201cglobalist\u201d elite that is supposedly manipulating those out-groups to carry out that task.\n\nWriting at the Atlantic, Peter Beinart offers a fascinating look at the history of this ideological inclination and the ideas, such as they are, at its core. As Beinart notes, white supremacists have long trafficked in a version of this narrative, claiming that civil rights activists (who were trying to liberate African Americans from Jim Crow) were being manipulated by Jews and international communists. Meanwhile, white nationalists of various stripes have long blamed Jews for opening our borders to Third World immigration.\n\nAs Beinart points out, there\u2019s a reason Jews have long supported civil and immigrants\u2019 rights: Because they are \u201cpredisposed,\u201d due to their \u201cunderstanding of Jewish history,\u201d to \u201cidentify with outsiders.\u201d But white nationalists see this otherwise, instead buying into the crackpot conspiracy narrative that Jews supported civil rights and now support immigrant rights because \u201cthey want to subjugate white Christians\u201d:\n\nOne reason hateful nativism so easily morphs into anti-Semitism in the Trump era is that today Jews really do disproportionately support immigration. The major American Jewish organizations overwhelmingly oppose Trump\u2019s immigration policies. So do rank and file American Jews, according to several polls. Among whites, Jews were dramatically overrepresented in the civil rights movement too. . . . [P]eople who demonize African Americans or Latino and Muslim immigrants notice that predisposition, and it leads them to demonize Jews too.\n\nHow did George Soros come to occupy the position of the leader of the Jewish conspiracy to orchestrate the browning of America? It\u2019s a long and tortured tale, which the New York Times told at length the other day. But one thing we can say is that Trump has played his own part in helping make that happen.\n\nIndeed, in retrospect, it\u2019s remarkable how well his 2016 campaign previewed some of what we\u2019re seeing today. In light of all of it, it\u2019s chilling to go back and watch his two-minute closing ad, which was the perfect statement of this type of xenophobic populist nationalism. Its blueprint is perfectly captured in two images from the ad. First, the \u201cglobal special interests\u201d:\n\nThen, the dark invading hordes \u2014 described as \u201cmassive illegal immigration\u201d being engineered by those global special interests:\n\nTrump was, and is, fluent in this language of xenophobic populist nationalism. It\u2019s why Stephen K. Bannon immediately recognized him as a kindred ideological spirit. And during the campaign, Trump was explicitly warned that this juxtaposition was a very dangerous one. As Joshua Green recounts in his biography of Bannon:\n\n\u201cDarkness is good,\u201d Bannon told Trump. \u201cDon\u2019t let up.\u201d And as president, Trump has decidedly not let up. He has not let up even after the Pittsburgh shooting.\n\nThe point is not that Trump is to blame for that massacre; it\u2019s that in its wake, Trump has continued to feed this crackpot conspiracy-mongering with more dangerous lies. Trump not only continues to hype the migrant caravan as a national emergency, even sending in troops to dramatize the point; he has also even continued to encourage the view that Soros is engineering it:\n\nReporter: Do you think somebody is funding the caravan? Do you think somebody is paying for the caravan? Trump: I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Reporter: George Soros? Who\u2019s paying for it? Trump: I don\u2019t know who. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. A lot of people say yes.\n\nTrump was warned during the campaign that these ideas were combustible. He has now seen this come to fruition in the most horrifying way possible. And as president, he\u2019s continued to feed them. And so have many other Republicans. Which he, and they, will continue to do no matter what other horrors come along.", "", "\n\nFall colors are peaking in the Catoctin Mountains, seen on Thursday.

Messitte in Greenbelt, Md., denied the Justice Department\u2019s request that he pause the case to allow a higher court to intervene. And Messitte sharply questioned the president\u2019s position that his business does not improperly accept gifts or payments \u2014 called emoluments \u2014 as defined by the Constitution.\n\nBy Trump\u2019s analysis, Messitte wrote, the term emoluments is the subject of such \u201csubstantial grounds of disagreement\u201d that payments his business received from foreign governments could not qualify. The judge did not agree: \u201cThe Court finds this a dubious proposition.\u201d\n\nMessitte ordered the plaintiffs, the attorneys general for the District and Maryland, to submit a schedule for discovery \u2014 the process of producing evidence for the case \u2014 within 20 days. That decision is subject to appeal.\n\nThe judge has limited discovery to information related to the president\u2019s District hotel. This is the second civil case in which Trump\u2019s business is now subject to discovery, after Trump agreed Tuesday to produce portions of his calendar from 2007 and 2008 in a defamation lawsuit brought by former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos.\n\nIn his 31-page opinion, Messitte rejected Trump\u2019s argument that this case should be halted so it could be appealed midstream \u2014 a request typically granted in extraordinary circumstances, where an unresolved legal question makes it hard to go on.\n\nJustice Department attorneys argued that the lawsuit should ultimately be dismissed because it was a burden for Trump, distracting from his duties as a sitting president. The department issued a statement signaling it would appeal again.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice disagrees with and is disappointed by this ruling,\u201d said spokeswoman Kelly Laco. \u201cThis case, which should have been dismissed, presents important questions that warrant immediate appellate review.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Organization did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\n[Read the judge\u2019s Nov. 2 opinion]\n\nThe Justice Department \u201cis attempting to delay discovery in our case,\u201d said Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D), who brought the case along with D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D). \u201cTheir ultimate argument was that this the president of the United States, he\u2019s too busy.\u201d\n\nBut Messitte had rejected that argument earlier, and in this opinion he noted, wryly, that \u2014 instead of avoiding legal battles \u2014 Trump seems to seek them out while in the White House.\n\nMessitte noted Trump\u2019s threats to sue author Michael Wolff and former adviser Stephen K. Bannon, and Trump\u2019s taunting of former CIA director John Brennan in August. After Trump revoked Brennan\u2019s security clearance, Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cI hope John Brennan, the worst CIA Director in our country\u2019s history, brings a lawsuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt bears noting that the President himself seems to have had little reluctance to pursue personal litigation despite the supposed distractions it imposes on his office,\u201d Messitte wrote.\n\nTrump still owns his company, although he says he has stepped back from day-to-day control. The Trump Organization has held several large events paid for by foreign governments at Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel and reported about $150,000 in what it called \u201cforeign profits\u201d last year.\n\nThe judge found that, \u201cthe President\u2019s ownership interest in the Trump International Hotel and his apparent receipt of benefits from at least some foreign and state governments, as well as from the Federal Government itself, suggest that he has received \u2018emoluments\u2019 in violation of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier ruling, Messitte had found that the definition of word emoluments, in the context of the late 1700s, was broad enough to include sales of goods or services. By the judge\u2019s logic, that definition meant that Trump could be taking emoluments merely by renting ballrooms to foreign-government customers.\n\nTrump had objected, saying that the word should be defined more narrowly, to mean only payments made to Trump specifically to influence his behavior as president.\n\n\u201cBy every reasonable metric, [Trump\u2019s definition] appears to describe what is tantamount to a bribe,\u201d the judge wrote in the Friday decision, calling that interpretation \u201cexceedingly strained.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team has some options to prevent discovery from proceeding, but they are dwindling. The judge directed Frosh and Racine to submit a schedule for discovery within 20 days.\n\n\u201cWe will soon provide the court a new schedule to begin the process of getting information about how President Trump is profiting from the presidency,\u201d Racine said in a statement.\n\nFrosh and Racine will seek details about spending at Trump\u2019s hotel in the District by foreign governments, state governments and the federal government. They want to look inside the finances of Trump\u2019s company to see how money flows through individual Trump businesses to Trump.\n\nThey also want to seek information from Trump on \u201chis communications with foreign, state and domestic government officials\u201d regarding the District hotel. And they want information about Trump\u2019s lease with the federal government, as his hotel is located in a federally owned historic building, which Trump leased long before he ran for office.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have asked for their own discovery \u2014 demanding details about whether the District or Maryland governments have been harmed, financially, by foreign-government customers leaving other hotels for Trump\u2019s.\n\nAnn E.

(Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nThis year\u2019s midterm election features an intensity usually reserved for a presidential race. In parts of central and eastern United States, a major storm system may add a wrinkle to this high-stakes contest.\n\nThe storm is set to rapidly develop Monday into Tuesday as it travels from the Southern Plains to the Great Lakes region. Numerous states could be hit by heavy rain and even some tornadoes.\n\nThe pattern supporting the storminess developed earlier this week and set the stage for a predecessor storm that spawned tornadoes across Louisiana and nearby areas before dawn on Wednesday. It is now moving up the East Coast, where heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected.\n\nThe Election Day storm system is already on the doorsteps of the Pacific Northwest. It will dive into the contiguous United States over the weekend.\n\nThe National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center is closely monitoring the potential for severe weather both Monday and Tuesday. It has highlighted zones that have an elevated risk of severe weather on both days (see below).\n\nThe Monday night into Tuesday morning time frame could be particularly troublesome in south central United States, as this will be another storm system capable of delivering strong tornadoes, even at night.\n\n\n\nSevere weather outlook areas for Monday and Tuesday of next week. Percentages are probability for severe thunderstorms within 25 miles of any point in the region of focus. (Storm Prediction Center, annotated by author)\n\nHowever, storms that form should be fairly short-lived, which should limit the overall impact on Election Day voting outside the hardest-hit communities.\n\nBeyond the potential for severe storms on Election Day, pockets of heavy rain could deter voters from the Great Lakes through the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and into the Northeast. In addition, winds will be very gusty over a large area from the south central United States through the Great Lakes as the storm cranks up.\n\n\n\nWind gust forecast from the GFS weather model, focused on Election Day. (Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nWhile there is no question a storm will form, there are still questions on the details of this storm\u2019s intensity, timing and the locations that will be hardest hit. The European model simulates the potential for a serious severe weather episode across the South, as well as parts of the Midwest and Southeast over several days. The American (GFS) weather model has alternated between more gentle and more potent storm scenarios.\n\nThe election means such weather will be more consequential than usual, and there is a good chance this storm will affect turnout to some degree.\n\nAlthough the increasing movement toward early voting may somewhat reduce the weather\u2019s impact, there are a number of close races in areas that will be affected by this storm.\n\nAs Angela Fritz of The Washington Post explored during the last major election cycle, bad weather may tend to favor Republican turnout, at least historically. The fervor surrounding this election could, however, make it bend a bit from history.\n\nHaving such a potent storm system in early November is not unusual.\n\nSevere weather usually peaks in the spring, but it can happen at any time if the right ingredients come together. In some years, fall becomes a second severe weather season.\n\nResearch has also shown autumns preceding El Ni\u00f1o winters can be particularly active for severe storms, and an El Ni\u00f1o is developing. In December 2015, which was an El Ni\u00f1o winter, there were several major episodes of tornado activity, which affected the Dallas area and some areas to the east.\n\nNovember is well known for vigorous storm systems such as this that develop and run into the Great Lakes. The Edmund Fitzgerald famously sank on Nov. 10, 1975, and terms such as the \u201cgales of November\u201d and \u201cNovember Witch\u201d have been popularized owing to storms at this time of year.", "I've been friends with \"Dorothy\" for many years. A couple years ago, her husband was laid off from his job, and Dorothy asked whether he could join us on our outings--about-town, such as movies and museum visits, etc. But I can take \"Danny\" only in small doses. He's very ... uh ... blunt and says things that are racially charged, personally intrusive. He does not approve of most of my friends or my adult children, and he even took my teen grandchild aside to tell her that if she's ever rude to me, he will punish her. (She's NOT rude, she's incredibly loving and spent a whole summer with me to help me at home while I was recovering from surgery, and she was mortified by this lecture, thinking she'd done something wrong.) My health is at a point right now that I can't really live alone for the time being, so my daughter has moved across the country to live with me and help out. At a party before my daughter arrived, my friend's husband went on an hourlong harangue on why this was a bad idea, my daughter is selfish and cruel, she's going to drain me financially, etc. His wife tried to tone this down, and others at the event also pushed back a bit. But I left the party abruptly and cried all the way home. I have pretty much stopped interacting with my friend Dorothy, because of course she shares my goings-on with Danny. My daughter's been here with me for two months and things have been wonderful. We're having a great time and my health is going well. I'd love to have lunch with my daughter and Dorothy, but Danny will undoubtedly come along, too (he has done that before when I was expecting a lunch with just Dorothy). Any advice on how to keep my friendship with Dorothy while artfully excluding Danny?", "\n\nBehind the smile, Magic Johnson apparently isn't happy with the Lakers' early-season struggles. (Damian Dovarganes/AP)\n\nLos Angeles Lakers President Magic Johnson told reporters in September that he and the team\u2019s other executives would not be putting too much pressure on Coach Luke Walton to win early and often this season, even though winning usually is a thing that happens whenever LeBron James joins your team.\n\n\u201cWe said don\u2019t worry about if we get out to a bad start,\u201d Johnson said then. \u201cWe have seen that with LeBron going to Miami, and we have seen that when he came back to Cleveland. He is going to struggle because there are so many new moving parts. But eventually we are going to get it, and we are going to be a really good team.\u201d\n\nStruggle they have. The Lakers are 3-5 entering Friday night\u2019s NBA schedule, having lost their first three games and more recently getting swept on a two-game swing through Minnesota and San Antonio. Part of that early slump may have something to do with the fact that two starters \u2014 Brandon Ingram and Rajon Rondo \u2014 were suspended for their roles in a brawl with the Rockets in the second game of the season. But according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowkski and Dave McMenamin, Johnson doesn\u2019t want to hear any excuses. After returning from the winless road trip, he \u201cadmonished\u201d Walton for the team\u2019s slow start using an \u201caggressive\u201d tone.\n\n\u201cJohnson\u2019s cutting appraisal elevated an already acute awareness within the Lakers coaching staff that there are intense and immediate pressures on Walton to deliver the franchise a winner in short order,\u201d the ESPN scribes reported.\n\nWhile it may be hard to believe that the perma-cheerful Johnson could ever deliver a \u201ccutting appraisal\u201d and be \u201caggressive\u201d toward anyone, his desire to win has never been too far from the surface. During his doomed tenure as the Lakers' head coach at the tail end of the 1993-94 season, Johnson\u2019s frustration with the team\u2019s younger players boiled over during an early-morning locker room meeting that followed a dismal loss in Phoenix the previous night.\n\n\u201cHe called guys out on how they just wanted to be Lakers for the parties and the girls,\u201d Danny Schayes, who was traded to the Lakers that season, recalled in 2015. \u201cHe reminded them how nobody at the parties cared about them, just that they were Lakers. Since they didn\u2019t take care of business, next year they would be gone and the girls would be interested in whoever else was wearing the Laker uniforms.\u201d\n\nAnd then Vlade Divac\u2019s pager went off.\n\nMagic stiffens up like a hunting dog and starts zooming in on the sound. It\u2019s muffled like its in a gym bag but the room is pretty small and we can all hear what direction it\u2019s coming from. I\u2019m biting my tongue trying not to laugh. This is going to be great! Luckily I didn\u2019t have a beeper so I can just enjoy the show. The damn beeper won\u2019t stop beeping. Finally Magic focuses in on Vlade Divac, who has his hand in his pocket trying unsuccessfully to turn it off. \u201cVlade, hand me the beeper\u201d says Magic. Vlade hands it over sheepishly. Magic holds it up and says, \u201cSee this is exactly what I am talking about\u201d and he turns around and throws it like a fastball into the wall, WHAM. It shatters into a million pieces. Vlade looks like a fish on the dock. His gills are moving furiously but no sound is coming out. Danny Schayes\n\nWalton probably knew better than to expect nothing but rainbows and sunshine from Johnson, anyway. He was a holdover from the team\u2019s previous regime \u2014 Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka came aboard in February 2017, midway through Walton\u2019s first season \u2014 and pro sports executives are usually pretty particular about handpicking their own coaches. James can be that way, too. Just ask former Cavaliers coach David Blatt.\n\nNevertheless, James is sticking by his coach, at least when reporters are present.\n\n\u201cI think Luke\u2019s trying to figure out what works best,\u201d James said after Wednesday\u2019s win over the Mavericks, perhaps a reference to the 93 different lineups Walton has utilized (only the Hawks have tinkered more). \u201cWe knew it was going to be like that from the summer when [Lonzo Ball] had the knee surgery. We knew we were going to have a lineup change there. Obviously, we had the unexpected one when we had the suspensions, so we had a lineup change there. ...\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a point where we know how comfortable we need to be with different lineups.\u201d\n\nRead more NBA coverage from The Post:\n\nFormer assistant Jim Boylan sues Cavs for age discrimination\n\nIt\u2019s Nov. 1 and the national media is already calling for a major Wizards trade\n\nWizards finish season\u2019s longest road trip battered, broken and out of answers\n\nWNBA players opt out of labor deal, set up showdown over pay, financial transparency\n\nDwight Howard will make his season debut on Friday, and the Wizards could certainly use him\n\nJimmy Butler rebuts report that game absence related to desire to be traded by T-Wolves", "\n\nRobots work on Tesla Model X SUVs in the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif. (Mason Trinca for The Washington Post)\n\nFederal securities regulators have issued subpoenas regarding Tesla\u2019s public assurances over the production of its newest car, the company said Friday, the latest signal of an increasingly aggressive investigation into Elon Musk\u2019s electric automaker.\n\nThe notice, tucked inside a 141-page quarterly report Tesla filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, confirms that the SEC has issued subpoenas as part of a deepening probe into the company\u2019s manufacturing projections for its Model 3 sedan last year. Those numbers were widely regarded as a make-or-break issue for Tesla as it sought to navigate factory chaos, slow its cash burn and prove to investors that it could survive.\n\nThe Justice Department has also requested documents as part of a similar investigation, but those investigators have not issued subpoenas or made other formal requests, Tesla said in a statement Friday. Tesla\u2019s SEC filing said that an enforcement action from either agency could damage its business, cash flow and future prospects.\n\n[Tesla turns a profit in what Musk calls \u2018a historic quarter\u2019]\n\nTesla and Musk, its billionaire chief executive, have pushed back strongly against a Wall Street Journal report last week that the FBI was pursuing a deepening criminal investigation into Tesla. In an interview with the tech outlet Recode released Friday morning, Musk called the report \u201cutterly false,\u201d \u201cabsurd\u201d and written by journalists who are \u201cterrible people.\u201d\n\nThe FBI and the SEC declined to comment on the matter.\n\nNews of the SEC\u2019s subpoenas comes a few weeks after Musk settled with the agency on a second investigation into his claims on Twitter that he would take Tesla private. The tweet, which Musk later said was a joke, caused the company stock to fall 14 percent. The SEC charged in a lawsuit that Musk had misled investors, and Tesla and Musk agreed last month to each pay $20 million and have Musk step down as chairman of the board.\n\n[For Silicon Valley, the SEC has become an unwelcome neighbor]\n\nThe expanding SEC probe could set up a new hurdle for a company that last month said it had finally resurfaced into profitability, thanks to booming sales of the Model 3. Tesla said Friday that it expected to incur undisclosed costs related to responding to the subpoenas and potentially defending against any government action.\n\nThe $58 billion company agreed as part of the SEC settlement to more closely monitor Musk\u2019s social-media commentary. But in the days after the settlement, Musk taunted the agency, tweeting, \u201cJust want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work.\"\n\nThe probe, led by SEC investigators in San Francisco, touches on questions that have been raised by Tesla investors and former employees into whether the company had truthfully conveyed its progress in producing its futuristic, battery-powered cars.\n\n[Tesla chief Elon Musk unveils a $35,000 Model 3 (that actually costs a bit more)]\n\nA former Tesla employee, Martin Tripp, sought whistleblower protection and filed SEC complaints claiming that Musk had overstated production numbers, which Tesla has disputed. Shareholders made similar claims in a securities-fraud lawsuit dismissed in August by a federal judge.\n\nUnconventional factory methods and failed attempts at automation forced the Silicon Valley automaker to endure months of costly delays and executive departures at its car factory in Fremont, Calif., during a time that Musk has called \u201cproduction hell.\u201d The company said Friday that it expected to spend up to $6 billion on factories and equipment through 2020.\n\n\u201cWhen we started the Model 3 production ramp, we were transparent about how difficult it would be,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile Tesla gets criticized when it is delayed in reaching a goal, it should not be forgotten that Tesla has achieved many goals that were doubted by most. We are enormously proud of the efforts of the whole company in making it through this difficult ramp and getting us to volume production.\u201d\n\nMusk put it a different way in his Recode interview: \u201cIt is absurd that Tesla is alive. Absurd! Absurd.\"\n\nMatt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nOn Thursday, we argued that Republicans had to do more than simply denounce President Trump\u2019s racist ad: \u201cThey need to demand that the ad come down and implore their colleagues on the ballot to denounce it. If the colleagues refuse, [Sens. Jeff] Flake and [Bob] Corker should pull endorsements from them.\u201d Well to his credit, Corker did almost that.\n\nThe Week reports:\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn) spoke before a crowd of friends and acquaintances at the Chattanooga Rotary Club on Thursday, and he defended President Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran deal, said he thinks Saudi Arabia should be punished for murdering journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and declined to endorse the Republican running to replace him, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R), saying he was friends with both her and Democrat Phil Bredesen and thought either would make a good senator for Tennessee.\n\nCorker also injected some reality \u2014 and humanity \u2014 into the discussion about immigrants.\n\n\u201cI look around the room, and I know most of you pretty well,\u201d he added. \u201cI have a feeling that if you were living in one of these Central American countries and you had little girls and little boys you were raising, you might be trying to figure out a way to come to the great United States of America.\u201d\n\nBravo, Senator!\n\nNow, Corker didn\u2019t say he was refusing to endorse Blackburn because the latter has no problem with the Trump campaign\u2019s racist ad or the president\u2019s blatant misuse of the military. And Corker has previously suggested that he would not campaign against former governor Phil Bredesen, a moderate Democrat and Corker\u2019s friend. Still, this is the type of independence that we wish Corker had show earlier and more regularly, and that we wish his colleagues, even once, would display.\n\nCorker\u2019s not running for reelection, but neither are Flake (R-Ariz.), a number of GOP House members nor many term-limited governors including Brian Sandoval of Nevada (who has endorsed, in the Senate race, Sen. Dean Heller, who has crawled his way back into Trump\u2019s good graces). So what\u2019s the excuse for these other retiring Republicans, many of whom have favored comprehensive immigration reform and criticized Trump\u2019s racist language in the past, not to step forward and demand fellow Republicans reject Trump\u2019s campaign of fear and caravan hysteria? Why don\u2019t they refuse to endorse Republican successors if they refuse to speak up?\n\nFor one thing, there\u2019s not more than a handful of retiring politicians under the age of 80 who don\u2019t think that sometime in the future they might come back. It might be ridiculous from the outside to think that some of these people could stage comebacks, but they don\u2019t think so. Then there\u2019s the hope for many that they\u2019ll snag jobs with conservative-minded groups, think tanks or lobbying shops. They don\u2019t want to be marked as someone the president will send nasty tweets about! And then there are personal friendships and favors to be repaid that keep retiring politicians from stepping out of their partisan lanes.\n\nThe Trump era has revealed and hardened the exceptionally strong shackles of party and tribe that have turned seemingly rational, principled and decent people into slavish apologists for Trump and his noxious brand of racism, nastiness, dishonesty and authoritarianism.

(Cell) (Britton, Carly (ELS-CMA))\n\nAn empire of germs dwells inside you, trillions strong. About a half-pound of bacteria plus their genes make up our microbiome. Though each microbe is small, a healthy and diverse microbiome is mighty. Its influence, studies suggest, spans the human condition \u2014 from mood swings to weight gain.\n\nThe microbiome begins as a departing gift from mothers at birth, but many factors alter its composition. Growing evidence shows location has a profound impact on the diversity of microbes, and some places are much less diverse than others. A study published this week in the journal Cell follows multi-generation immigrants from Southeast Asia to the United States. As they moved, their microbes responded. Once in the United States, the immigrants' gut diversity dropped to resemble the less-varied microbiomes in European Americans. At the same time, obesity rates spiked.\n\n\u201cWe found that moving to a new country changes your microbiome,\u201d said Dan Knights, a computational microbiologist at the University of Minnesota and an author of the paper. \u201cYou pick up the microbiome of the new country and possibly some of the new disease risks that are more common in that country.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, immigrants in the study ate foods richer in sugars, fats and protein. Microbiomes changed within months of moving. \u201cPeople began to lose their native microbes almost immediately after arriving in the U.S.,\" Knights said. \u201cThe loss of diversity was quite pronounced: Just coming to the USA, just living in the USA, was associated with a loss of about 15 percent of microbiome diversity.\u201d\n\nObesity rates among many of the study immigrants increased sixfold. Those who became obese also lost an additional 10 percent of their diversity. \u201cAnd the children of immigrants,\u201d Knights said, \u201chad yet again another 5 to 10 percent loss.\u201d\n\nAs microbial diversity decreases, the risk of diseases such as obesity and diabetes increases. \u201cIt\u2019s been known from previous studies that people in developing nations tend to have more gut microbiome diversity and lower risk of metabolic diseases,\u201d Knights said. \u201cIt was also known that moving from a developing nation to the U.S. increases your risk of those diseases.\u201d But no one had tested whether the microbiome changed after immigration, too.\n\n\u201cThe association made between changes in dietary factors, toward a more \u2018Westernized\u2019 nutritional diet, and the loss of bacterial diversity\u201d was \u201cparticularly striking,\u201d said Eran Elinav, who studies the human microbiome at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. (In 2014, Elinav and his colleagues reported that traveling to distant time zones by plane alters the microbiome, as though the germs were jet-lagged.)\n\nBut changes in diet were slower than changes in microbiome, suggesting factors beyond American food were at play. \u201cWe found that diet alone wasn\u2019t enough to explain the rapid Westernization of the microbiome,\u201d Knights said \u2014 differences in drinking water and antibiotics possibly contributed as well.\n\nThe new study supports hypotheses that Western lifestyle influences the microbiome. Industrialization is correlated with a drop-off: Indigenous South American people, for instance, have about twice as many species in their guts, compared with a person in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe have known from some small, not well controlled studies that the microbiome does change \u2014 and we have known for many years that adopting a Western lifestyle is associated with an increase in disease,\u201d said microbial ecosystem expert Jack Gilbert, director of the University of Chicago\u2019s Microbiome Center, who was not involved with the current study. \u201cThis brings those two concepts together.\u201d\n\nKnights and his colleagues examined microbiomes in stool samples from more than 500 women. Two ethnic groups from Asia, the Hmong and Karen people, represent a large portion of immigrants in Minnesota. (Men were not included, because substantially more women from these communities moved to the state.)\n\nSome Hmong and Karen women in this study lived and remained in Thailand. Others were first- and second-generation U.S. immigrants. To get a before and after snapshot, researchers also took microbiome samples from 19 Karen women before their departure and after their arrival. The scientists compared all of these microbiomes with those of 36 European Americans born in the United States.\n\nThe dominant species in the gut changed from strains of bacteria called Prevotella to a group of bacteria called Bacteroides. Prevotella bacteria produce enzymes that digest fibrous foods more common in Asia than the United States. In Thailand, the women ate more palm, coconut, a fruit called tamarind and the bulbous part of a plant named konjac.\n\n\u201cThe diet analysis is as good as it can be for any populations. Yes, lifestyle factors could influence these trends, but the trends we observe could easily be explained by diet changes,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\n\"We know from studies in animals that having the wrong set of microbes can cause obesity,\u201d Knights said. In pioneering work at the Washington University in St. Louis, scientists took germs from obese women and transplanted the microbes into healthy mice. Those mice grew heavier, even when they ate the same food as their lean rodent equivalents.\n\nThe authors of the current work, though, do not have evidence the microbial changes directly increased obesity risk in immigrant women. It is possible that a Western lifestyle leads to obesity while the microbiome independently adjusts. Or a sequence of events could occur: A new diet and lifestyle leads to different microbes, and those microbes, as the mouse studies suggest, have a direct effect on obesity. For the time being, no \u201cformal proof\u201d exists to link microbiome alterations to human disease, Elinav said.\n\nKnights suspects these patterns hold for people elsewhere across the world who adopt Western countries or lifestyles as their own. \u201cBecause we were able to confirm the same findings in two different ethnic groups, we expect that we would see something similar happening in the other immigrant groups,\u201d he said. But, as always, future research will show whether this prediction rings true.\n\nRead more:\n\nTiny gut organisms may influence food cravings and what our bodies do with fat\n\nYou\u2019re surrounded by a cloud of bacteria as unique as a fingerprint", "The end was near for Tala and Rotana Farea when the man happened upon them in Manhattan\u2019s Riverside Park, police said. The sisters had run away from Virginia to New York and maxed out a credit card shopping and staying at high-end hotels.\n\nNow, early on Oct. 24 in a scene the man would later describe as \u201chaunting,\u201d the sisters from Saudi Arabia had their heads lowered and appeared to be praying loudly about 30 feet from each other on a playground near the Hudson River.\n\nJust hours later and dozens of blocks south, another passerby would find their bodies on the Hudson\u2019s rocky shore, loosely bound together with duct tape after having washed ashore, police said.\n\n[\u2018I don\u2019t know where my daughters are\u2019: A bizarre encounter deepens mystery]\n\nNew York City police began to unravel the mystery of what happened to Tala, 16, and Rotana, 22, saying at a news conference Friday that they had no indication the sisters had been killed, even as they await an official cause of death from the medical examiner. The case has generated nationwide attention.\n\nChief of Detectives Dermot Shea said the sisters had alleged that they were abused by family members and sought asylum on those grounds in the United States. He said sources in Virginia told detectives that \u201cthey would rather inflict harm on themselves than return to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nHe added later, \u201cEverything that we\u2019ve seen thus far is pointing to other than a crime taking place.\u201d\n\nShea said detectives were filling in a murky two-month period after the girls disappeared from Fairfax County around Aug. 23. He said electronic records, including Uber receipts, showed the sisters took various forms of transportation, arriving in New York City around Sept. 1.\n\nShea said that over the next seven weeks, they stayed at upscale hotels, including the Knickerbocker in Times Square where rooms rent for more than $400 a night. The sisters were captured on surveillance video appearing with each other and in good health. They went shopping.\n\nBut it soon came to an end.\n\n\u201cThe money started to run out \u2014 that\u2019s what we believe started to happen,\u201d Shea said.\n\nThe sisters were found on rocks beneath a pier on the Upper West Side. They were fully clothed and bore no signs of trauma. Silvery duct tape was wrapped around their ankles and torsos, leading to speculation they might have been killed and dumped.\n\nBut Shea said the duct tape was loose, more like it was meant to keep them together rather than bind them. He said police had every indication that the Fareas were alive when they entered the water.\n\nShea began the story of what led the sisters to the Hudson over a year earlier, filling in some of the scant details known about their lives. The sisters had little presence online, and no photos of them could be located before police released some this week.\n\nShea said the last time family members had seen both sisters was around Dec. 1, 2017, when they left their home in Fairfax, Va. The sisters were found within a day, but transferred to a shelter because of abuse allegations. Shea and Fairfax County police declined to give the shelter\u2019s name, citing privacy restrictions.\n\nOver the next eight months, the sisters lived at the shelter and family members had no contact with them, Shea said. The sisters then left the shelter on Aug. 23 or Aug. 24 and made their way to New York City.\n\nShea said detectives had not corroborated the sisters\u2019 allegations of abuse, but they were \u201cbetween the brother, the mother and father\u201d and were sometime in the past. Shea described the abuse as physical, but it also involved other things he said he would not describe.\n\nShea said initial reports that the Fareas might have jumped from the George Washington Bridge were likely not true, since their bodies had no signs of a fall from a high place. Likewise, reports that their bodies were found crosswise on top of each other were also inaccurate.\n\nShea said he could not confirm a report based on unnamed police sources in the New York Post that the mother of the sisters received a phone call from a Saudi Embassy official who told her she might have to leave the United States because the sisters had applied for asylum. The call reportedly came the day before the sisters\u2019 bodies were found.\n\nA Saudi official said Thursday that was inaccurate, saying they had only communicated with the mother about her expired immigration status in the United States. For privacy reasons, the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that it could not reveal whether the sisters had applied for asylum.\n\nThe mother of the sisters declined to comment when reached by phone Friday.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it,\u201d she said.\n\nRotana had attended school at George Mason University before dropping out in the spring, school officials said. Tala was a student at Fairfax High School for part of the 2017-2018 school year.\n\nIn 2016, family members were evicted from an apartment in Falls Church, Va., for unpaid rent.\n\nA woman whose niece attended school with the sisters in their hometown of Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, said they were inseparable and had been hopeful before arriving in the United States.\n\n\u201cThey were very much looking forward to going to the US, and had always encouraged my niece to do the same. . . . \u2018Study hard and get out to the US!\u2019 \u201d the woman wrote in a text message.", "OTTAWA \u2014 In December 2014, Hydro-Quebec, Canada\u2019s largest electric power utility, was hit with a crippling blackout at the start of winter. Traffic lights went dark, and more than 188,000 customers lost power, including Montreal\u2019s McGill University Health Center.\n\nThe utility was forced to scramble to avoid a systemwide outage. Power exports to the Northeast United States were cut. Industrial users were asked to slash production, and the provincially owned utility was required to buy emergency power from neighboring utilities. Cost to the utility was estimated at $22 million.\n\nUnlike most such incidents, however, the blackout was not weather-related or an act of God. As a Quebec court has heard, the power failure resulted from an act of sabotage by Normand Dub\u00e9, a 56-year-old pilot and inventor with a grudge against the utility, who used a small aircraft to hobble two massive power lines. Dub\u00e9 was found guilty of three charges of criminal mischief in September.\n\nDub\u00e9 was back in court this week in St. Jerome, Quebec, for a sentencing hearing in the unusual trial, much of which was held in secret because of national security concerns. Prosecutors argued the self-described \u201cpilot to the stars\u201d \u2014 his clients included several Quebec entertainers \u2014 should be given 10 years in prison for the attack.\n\nProsecutor Steve Baribeau told the court the pilot had attacked \u201cthe jugular and the spinal column\u201d of the Hydro-Quebec power grid, according to the Canadian Press.\n\n\u201cWhat could be a worse way to destabilize a society than to cut electricity on such a large scale?\u201d Baribeau argued.\n\nThe exact method used by Dub\u00e9 to sabotage the lines, that transport electricity from hydroelectric dams in northern Quebec, is unknown because a publication ban was ordered on much of the testimony during the 27-day trial. Prosecutors sought the ban to protect national security and, presumably, to discourage copycats.\n\nThe 24-page judgment was also redacted, with references to the method used to disable the lines blacked out. However, Judge Paul Chevalier quoted an expert witness from Canada\u2019s National Research Council as saying the technique had been used during conflicts in Iraq, Kosovo and Serbia and was \u201ceasily accessible on the Internet.\u201d\n\nA close reading of the judgment indicates that unidentified materials were dropped on the lines from the plane at three locations on the same day, prompting short circuits that ricocheted across the Hydro-Quebec grid.\n\nWhat is known is Dub\u00e9 had a long-running dispute with Hydro-Quebec over the utility\u2019s efforts to access power lines that run through land he owned. The judge described the dispute in his ruling as \u201ca deep-seated grudge\u201d against the utility.\n\nDespite having finished high school only, Dub\u00e9 is a successful inventor, having designed a single-engine aircraft called the Aerocruiser and built a successful general aviation business.\n\nHe also invented a solar panel system and a machine to eliminate insects infesting commercial greenhouses that grow tomatoes, according to the judge.\n\nBaribeau told The Washington Post that Hydro-Quebec initially had no idea what had caused the blackout, but two loggers in the area, near Mirabel airport north of Montreal, saw a small plane overflying the affected power lines, which then exploded in front of their eyes. The men called the utility, and the police were called in.\n\nArmed with a description of the plane, an Aerocruiser designed by Dub\u00e9, the police obtained detailed radar information from Nav Canada, which runs the country\u2019s air traffic control system. Dub\u00e9\u2019s plane was identified as the culprit, Baribeau said.\n\n\u201cThere was no ambiguity,\u201d Baribeau told The Post. \u201cThere was no other airplane in the area at the time.\u201d\n\nDub\u00e9\u2019s lawyer told the court his client could not be considered a terrorist because he was not a follower of any political or religious ideology. Dub\u00e9 admitted overflying the power lines on the day of the blackout but denied committing sabotage.\n\nMeanwhile, the pilot is facing a lawsuit from Hydro-Quebec that is seeking to recoup the millions lost during the blackout. Dub\u00e9 also is facing separate criminal charges resulting from a series of disputes he had with municipal officials over property evaluations. In one case, a municipal employee\u2019s house was destroyed by fire, and another official was the victim of a Molotov cocktail attack.\n\nThe prosecutor has also asked that the judge seize Dub\u00e9\u2019s plane.\n\nDub\u00e9 has said he plans to appeal his conviction. The judge will decide on Dub\u00e9\u2019s sentence in the sabotage case Dec. 10.", "\n\nThe existence of a homeless encampment in Minneapolis is shining a light on a homelessness crisis sparked by a lack of mental health care, affordable housing and drug addiction treatment. (Kerem Yucel /AFP/ Getty Images)\n\nA new report on the state of mental health in the United States says that in recent years, there have been \u201calarming\u201d increases in major depression in youth and in the prevalence of adults harboring suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe 2018 installment of \u201cThe State of Mental Health in America\u201d from the nonprofit Mental Health America also says most Americans who need access to mental health care do not get it, and it details the long-term consequences of childhood trauma.\n\nKey Findings\n\nMental Health America, which works to ensure people get the mental-health services they need, used 15 measures (such as the percentages of youth with major depression and substance use disorder) to reach its conclusions. The information came from databases and was the latest available for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (with some minor exceptions). The latest year available was 2015 (meaning the Trump era is not included).\n\n[1 in 3 college freshmen show signs of mental-health disorders]\n\nThe authors of the report concede the 15 measures do not present \u201ca complete picture of the mental health system\u201d in this country, but \u201cthey do provide a strong foundation for understanding the prevalence of mental health concerns, as well as issues of access to insurance and treatment.\" They also note some of the surveys used to get data do not include the homeless population, whose inclusion would likely raise the percentage of youth and adults who suffer from mental illness.\n\nThe report says:\n\nWhile much of the state of our mental health care continues to be broken, there are glimmers of hope. Since the release of its first report [five years ago], MHA is seeing small yet encouraging decreases in the number of American adults who have mental health concerns (from 18.19% to 18.07%) and substance use problems (from 8.76% to 7.93%). Yet overall, the picture is still quite bleak. . . . The estimated number of adults with serious suicidal thoughts is over 9.8 million \u2013 an increase of 200,000 people since last year. Over 2 million young people cope with severe major depression. And that is just the population that has been diagnosed. On average, it takes 10 years between the onset of symptoms and when individuals receive treatment. Over 24 million individuals experiencing a mental health illness are going untreated.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors spend time detailing the long-term impact of trauma on young people, noting it is estimated 1 in 4 children will experience maltreatment in their lifetime, while 1 in 7 experienced it in the past year. There was a 3.8 percent increase in reported childhood abuse cases from 2011 to 2015, though many cases go unreported.\n\nTrauma, the report says, can cause permanent changes in the structure and chemical activity in the brain, affecting the ability to learn, solve problems, regulate emotions and assess and respond to environmental threats. It also says cognitive, emotional and behavioral effects of trauma are often heightened when a child starts school and finds herself in a new environment and routine, which can \u201ccause emotional, psychological and physical distress.\u201d\n\n[Read the report in full]", "\n\nMigrants in a caravan headed from El Salvador to the United States hitchhike on a Guatemalan highway Thursday. (Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters)\n\nAs the sun rose on the Salvador del Mundo monument in San Salvador, dozens of would-be migrants with small backpacks and duffel bags trickled into the central plaza. They settled on benches and stairs to await instructions.\n\nWithin an hour, at least 100 had gathered. By 8 a.m., about 300 \u2014 all of them responding to the same WhatsApp group message about when and where to meet. From the far corner of the plaza, a voice called out: \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nWithin moments, all the migrants had stood up, gathered their belongings \u2014 clothes, family trinkets and stuffed animals for the children \u2014 and walked through the plaza, across the street and past a gas station.\n\nIt was their first steps in a potential 1,600-mile journey to the United States, with hopes of perhaps finding a job, or maybe reuniting with relatives and friends, or possibly seeking asylum to escape the street violence at home.\n\nThe group, which left San Salvador on Wednesday, became part of at least the fourth Central American caravan to form since mid-October, when one left San Pedro Sula in Honduras and headed north.\n\nCaravans were once used sparingly to spotlight a particular problem. A group of Central American mothers, for example, has traveled through Mexico each year for 14 years searching for sons and daughters who disappeared on the migrant trail. The Mesoamerican Caravan for a Good Life has organized migrant caravans for years, including one in March that gained international attention.\n\n\n\nA caravan member rests at a park in Tecun Uman, Guatemala. (Jose Cabezas/Reuters)\n\nBut experts now predict that caravan-style treks could become a more frequent scene along the decades-old migration routes from the region.\n\nPresident Trump has reacted with combative and unsubstantiated claims that the migrants \u2014 including many families and children \u2014 pose a threat that requires military mobilization at the southern border.\n\nStill, the national attention has also brought awareness of the potential benefits of the caravans for migrants, such as increased safety along the route and shared resources. This could bring even more such groups in the future, migrant activists say.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t previously seen caravans as an organizational strategy to get to the U.S. and cross the border,\u201d said Celia Medrano, chief program officer at Cristosal, a San Salvador-based organization that works with migrants. \u201cThis is going to be the new method of irregular immigration.\u201d\n\n[Bandaged feet, bleeding hands: The caravan takes its toll]\n\nTraveling in groups is perceived as safer and cheaper for migrants, who often pay $7,000 to $10,000 to smugglers called coyotes to avoid the dangers of crossing Mexico. Migrants do not pay to join a caravan, and many travel without much cash, to avoid being robbed. Rather than carry many provisions, members of the caravan often rely on the generosity of people along the way to feed them.\n\nBut the caravans also present tough logistic and political issues along the routes.\n\nOn Oct. 22, Trump threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries if they did not stop the flow of migrants, putting even more pressure on the governments to take a stand.\n\n\u201cThe government institutions in all of the countries had become accustomed to making invisible the phenomenon [of undocumented migrants], looking the other way knowing that thousands of people are crossing underground,\u201d Medrano said. \u201cNow they can\u2019t deny it, they can\u2019t ignore it and they can\u2019t avoid confronting it, because it is right under their noses.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome of the caravan migrants board a pickup truck while hitchhiking on a highway in Guatemala. (Jose Cabezas/Reuters)\n\nIn Honduras, the caravan stoked already high political tensions between President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and opposition leaders who call his reelection fraudulent. Fliers promoting the Oct. 12 caravan openly criticized the Honduran government and blamed the current administration for creating the conditions from which migrants flee. Hern\u00e1ndez has tried to lure migrants back to Honduras with the promise of employment.\n\nGuatemala and Honduras temporarily closed their borders in October, even though a regional agreement allows citizens of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua to pass freely between borders with proper documentation. President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n of El Salvador has said he will not comply with the U.S. demand to stop migrants from leaving.\n\nYet while the Salvadoran government recognizes its citizens\u2019 right to leave, it also felt compelled to warn would-be migrants about what is often a harrowing process.\n\nPolice, immigration officials and child-protection institutions were dispatched to the plaza where migrants gathered to speak about the travel documents they would need and the dangers of the journey. The underlying message was clear: Don\u2019t go.\n\n[Gallery: Scenes among the migrants making their way north]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to most of these Salvadoran citizens about the dangers of irregular migration to raise awareness,\u201d Evelyn Marroquin, director of the Directorate General of Migration and Foreigners, said in an official statement. \u201cIn the last minute they can reflect and give up this voyage that can be so grave for them and their families.\u201d\n\nThese campaigns are \u201ctoo late\u201d for migrants who already made the decision and understand the risks, Medrano said.

(Jose Cabezas/Reuters)\n\nThe wave of caravans has been particularly challenging for the Mexican government, which has dedicated extensive resources to helping its northern neighbor prevent Central American migrants from reaching the U.S. border, by deporting them and making their journey more difficult.\n\nThe Mexican government has tried multiple strategies to stop the caravans \u2014 amassing police at the border, promising work permits and offering political asylum \u2014 but to no avail. There are still an estimated 4,200 migrants traveling through Mexico in the first of the most recent caravans.\n\nTrying to stop it presents Mexico with a political dilemma. While the United States threatens political retribution for not blocking caravans, Mexican citizens appear to overwhelmingly support the migrants and their journey.\n\n\u201cThey are caught between the concerns of the U.S. government, which they want to be responsive to, and Mexican public opinion, which they have to listen to,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nAs more migrants band together, caravans are gaining legitimacy in the eyes of would-be migrants.\n\n\u201cIf images keep being transmitted of people traveling together, and if those people make it further along, more people are going to see the groups as a safe way to travel and, hopefully, be able to reach the U.S. border and request asylum,\u201d said Maureen Meyer, the director for Mexico and migrant rights in the Washington Office on Latin America, a research organization.\n\n\n\nCaravan members wait in line for food Thursday in Tecun Uman, Guatemala.

Signs that their asylum applications are being rejected, for example, could deter future groups, Meyer said.\n\nIf caravans result in mass deportations, Central American institutions tasked with receiving and reintegrating deportees could collapse, Medrano said.\n\nBut as long as the caravans remain a safe and viable option for migrating, experts say they will continue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the new way,\u201d Medrano said, \u201cof making visible what was before invisible.\u201d\n\nJoshua Partlow and Kevin Sieff in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nOne day and 28 miles with the migrant caravan\n\nWhy travel in a caravan?

Almost as many \u2014 47 percent \u2014 say the media encourage politically motivated violence in the way they report the news. And 19 percent say Trump is discouraging violence while 15 percent say the same of the news media; about 3 in 10 say both are neither encouraging nor discouraging violence.\n\nAs is often the case, partisans are nearly complete opposites in the poll. A 76 percent majority of Democrats say Trump is encouraging politically motivated violence while 69 percent of Republicans say the same about the news media in the way they report the news. Among political independents, roughly half see Trump and the media alike as encouraging political violence.\n\nA separate question finds 69 percent of voters saying that \u201creducing political divisions between people and groups in this country\u201d is a very important issue in their vote for Congress or one of the most important issues. Democrats have a significant advantage on this issue, with 46 percent saying they trust them more to reduce political divisions, compared with 31 percent who trust Republicans more. A sizable 17 percent minority of voters volunteer that \u201cneither\u201d party is more trustworthy in reducing divisions between people and groups in the United States, a view that peaks at 25 percent among political independents.\n\nThe survey was conducted shortly after a mass shooter killed 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue and another person mailed possible package bombs to prominent critics of Trump. Critics have blamed Trump for stoking anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and broader racial and political divisions that might have inspired the attacks. Trump denounced the attacks and rejected claims that he is responsible for fostering an environment that encourages them, calling for national unity and blaming anger in society on \u201cpurposely false and inaccurate reporting in the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News.\u201d\n\n[Critics say Trump has fostered the toxic environment for the political violence he denounces]\n\nThe Post-ABC poll finds that while almost half of voters believe that Trump\u2019s rhetoric and media coverage are encouraging violence, 16 percent fault both Trump and the media.

The rest of the respondents say that neither is encouraging violence, or they have no opinion.\n\nOn the broader question of reducing the nation\u2019s divisions, voters largely side with their own party, though Democrats are more united than Republicans. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats, 87 percent, trust their party more to reduce divisions between people and groups in the United States, while 73 percent of Republicans trust the GOP. A quarter of independents trust neither party, while 41 percent trust Democrats and 24 percent trust Republicans more.\n\nDespite deep partisan divisions, the poll finds a break from the partisan seesaw in whether voters see Trump and the media \u201cdiscouraging\u201d politically motivated violence. Just over 3 in 10 Republicans, 31 percent, say Trump is discouraging violence, compared with 16 percent of independents and 13 percent of Democrats. But fewer than 2 in 10 Democrats (19 percent) say the same about the media, dipping further to 14 percent among both Republicans and independents.\n\nThe Post-ABC poll was conducted via cellphone and landline telephone Oct. 29 to Nov. 1 among 1,041 registered voters and carries an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.", "", "Opinion writer\n\nStep back and marvel at this fact: The economy is in some ways doing as well as it has in decades, and yet not only are the president\u2019s approval ratings around 42 percent and his party poised to suffer huge losses in the midterm election, they\u2019re barely talking about the economy on the campaign trail.\n\nAs President Trump so eloquently put it in another context: What the hell is going on?\n\nToday we got the latest job numbers, which show that 250,000 new jobs were created in October and the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent. On one hand, this is just a continuation of the last couple of years of the Obama administration: Trump has now overseen the creation of 4.1 million jobs in his first 21 months in office, while 4.5 million were created in Barack Obama\u2019s last 21 months in office. But on the other hand, which policies helped produce the results doesn\u2019t much matter in politics; what matters is that the economy is doing well while Republicans are in charge.\n\nYet while Trump touts the good economic news regularly, and candidates do sometimes mention it, the economy is nothing like the centerpiece of the Republican campaign. What are they running on instead?\n\nThere are two deeply contradictory messages, and that contradiction encapsulates the problem they now face.\n\nThe first message, pitched to voters in liberal, swing and even some conservative districts and states, is this: \u201cI\u2019m kinda like a Democrat!\u201d Republican candidates across the country are promising to protect people with preexisting conditions despite the fact that they\u2019ve been trying to take those protections away for almost a decade and are still trying to as we speak. They\u2019re saying Democrats are a threat to Medicare and Social Security. In other words, they want voters to believe that the GOP is caring, compassionate and committed to a strong role for government in protecting your welfare.\n\nSpectacularly dishonest though that message may be, it has worked before. The problem, though, is that another message is competing for voters\u2019 attention: the message of terror coming from the president and his allies in conservative media, all about how dark-skinned immigrants are coming to destroy your country and threaten your family.\n\nIf you look around, you see that those messages vary by district; while the pro-safety-net message dominates in most places, many Republicans are also mounting some pretty vile racist attacks against their opponents. The problem is that you can\u2019t keep that stuff contained when the president is working hard to make the election about fear and hatred of nonwhites.\n\nThis gets to a fundamental feature of contemporary politics that was already true to a degree, but has been exacerbated by the Trump presidency. We used to say \u201cAll politics is local,\u201d meaning that even senators and members of the House had to be concerned with local concerns: You can tell a voter that you worked on an arms control treaty, but if they can\u2019t get the pothole in front of their house fixed, they\u2019ll still be angry. Today, it\u2019s almost the opposite: What\u2019s happening at the national level affects every race down to the most local level.\n\nIt\u2019s the result of party polarization and modern communication technology, since nobody can avoid national politics and we can learn quickly about what\u2019s happening anywhere in the country. But it\u2019s also about Trump. Not just because he\u2019s a big personality who seizes the news agenda, but because his theory of politics is that the way for him to win is to be as outrageous and offensive as possible in order to make his enemies angry and his core supporters cheer.\n\nThere\u2019s a common impulse to assume that if Trump has managed to make everyone talk about something he said or did, then that means he\u2019s winning. He certainly believes it, but it isn\u2019t necessarily true. All you have to do is look around at the swing districts, particularly those in the suburbs, where Republican candidates are trying to present themselves as moderate and reasonable but can\u2019t do it because of the stream of bile coming from the Oval Office. Here\u2019s how the New York Times describes the situation:\n\nIn Republican-leaning districts that include diverse populations or abut cities that do \u2014 from bulwarks of Sunbelt conservatism like Houston and Orange County, Calif., to the well-manicured bedroom communities outside Philadelphia and Minneapolis \u2014 the party is in danger of losing its House majority next week because Mr. Trump\u2019s racially-tinged nationalism has alienated these voters who once made up a dependable constituency.\n\nDemocrats stand to make some of their most significant gains in districts like these, dominated by people who are doing well economically and, if given an ordinary Republican president, would be happy to vote for Republican members of Congress as an affirmation of their satisfaction. But they\u2019re being repelled by Trump\u2019s hateful white nationalism, and the closer we get to the election, the more Trump is ratcheting up precisely the rhetoric that is already driving these voters away. It\u2019s hard to say you\u2019re a sensible candidate when the leader of your party is fantasizing about gunning down asylum seekers.\n\nAll this shows that the bargain Republicans made when Trump got the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 contained the seeds of their party\u2019s coming defeat. They said to themselves, \u201cSure, he\u2019s a buffoon and a liar and a race-baiter. But he\u2019ll bring out working-class white voters, and if we win, we\u2019ll get the policies we want and a boatload of conservatives judges. It\u2019ll work out fine.\u201d\n\nThey were right about the policies and the judges, but they were wrong if they thought they could maintain the party\u2019s identity as something that could be differentiated from Trump. He is the GOP now. That means that local candidates have to answer for him whether they want to or not, and young people are utterly disgusted by the party, a feeling they\u2019ll carry with them for years or even decades.\n\nAnd it means that even if the economy is doing well, Republicans can\u2019t convince voters to give them credit for it. Imagine what will happen if there\u2019s a downturn.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: Happy Hour Roundup", "", "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, writing in The Washington Post on Friday, said that the order to kill journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u201ccame from the highest levels of the Saudi government\u201d and that \u201ccertain Saudi officials\u201d were trying to cover up the crime.\n\n\u201cOur friendship with Riyadh, which goes back a long time, doesn\u2019t mean we will turn a blind eye to the premeditated murder that unfolded in front of our very eyes,\u201d Erdogan wrote in an article for The Post\u2019s Global Opinions section.

A few thunderstorms, embedded within rain bands, may produce damaging winds and even an isolated tornado.\n\nA few pockets of flash flooding could develop, potentially exacerbated by clogged drains from leaf fall.

We\u2019ve been savoring the warm air ahead of an approaching cold front, but a potent disturbance in the upper atmosphere will cross over that front and trigger a wave of low pressure. The low pressure system will ride along the front, wringing out the atmosphere through the evening and overnight.\n\nThe animation below shows the evolution of the pattern. Late Friday afternoon, the cold front will slowly move eastward and become draped across the Interstate 95 corridor. A moist air mass will surge north along the front. Meanwhile, low pressure will initiate over Appalachia and track northward, crossing Northern Virginia. Air converging into the low pressure front will focus bouts of moderate to heavy rain across the greater D.C. region through the evening.\n\n\n\nForecast weather map at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Friday. (National Weather Service)\n\nThe pattern in the upper atmosphere is impressive. As shown in the animation below, there is a sharp dip in the jet stream called a shortwave trough. As it advances eastward out of the Ohio Valley, the trough will amplify and take on a characteristic called negative tilt. In this very dynamic scenario, widespread uplift of air will intensify over the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\n\nUpper level wind pattern valid 8 p.m. Friday and 8 a.m. Saturday, showing amplifying trough (dipping region) over Mid-Atlantic. (Unisys.com)\n\nThe most widespread weather threat late Friday afternoon and evening will be heavy rain, which may persist in some locations due to a process called \u201cecho training.\u201d This means repeated passage of showers over the same spots, moving rapidly from the southwest. This happens when upper-level steering winds become parallel to a slow-moving frontal boundary. Accordingly, the Weather Prediction Center has placed our region in a slight risk zone for excessive rainfall.\n\nAs shown below, D.C. is within an anticipated corridor of heavy rainfall that extends northeastward into New England. This diagram shows expected rain accumulation, through Saturday morning, based on the consensus of model guidance.\n\nIt would appear that the heaviest rain could set up slightly east of D.C., along the Chesapeake Bay. However, our ability to localize narrow zones of heavy rain remains imprecise, and that axis could easily shift westward to encompass the D.C. region proper.\n\n\n\n24-hour rainfall forecast from National Weather Service.\n\nHere are rainfall projections from different models in Washington:\n\nHigh-resolution Canadian: 0.7 inches\n\nNAM: 0.8 inches\n\nHigh-resolution NAM: 0.8 inches\n\nEuropean: 1.0 inches\n\nCanadian: 1.0 inches\n\nHRRR: 1.4 inches\n\nAmerican (GFS): 1.5 inches\n\nAssessing the severe thunderstorm risk\n\nUplift of air will become very focused over our region for several hours later Friday, due to the combination of the front, low pressure and strong upper level trough. In general, given the thick cloud cover, the atmosphere is not very unstable - which will be a limiting factor for thunderstorms. However, any pockets of unstable air that develop have the potential to trigger deeper convective clouds.\n\nThe thunderstorm ingredient of concern is wind shear (increase in winds with altitude). The wind shear Friday morning was already quite impressive, and will likely increase through the day as wind fields aloft strengthen. Any deep clouds that interact with this shear may become severe, even acquiring brief supercell characteristics - meaning the storms would rotate. These instances should remain isolated (if at all), but pose a threat of damaging wind gusts and a tornado or two.\n\n\n\nThunderstorm risk assessment for Friday. (National Weather Service)\n\nThe National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has placed our region under a marginal threat of severe weather, but may upgrade regions of the Mid-Atlantic later Friday, depending on destabilization trends.\n\nCapital Weather Gang\u2019s Jason Samenow contributed to this article.", "\n\nUniversity of Maryland students pause for a moment of silence during a \u201cJustice for Jordan\u201d rally on Nov. 1.

It has not elaborated on what connection, if any, the pair had to Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nTurkey\u2019s prosecutor said this week that the Saudi agents strangled Khashoggi almost immediately after he entered the consulate on Oct. 2 and then dismembered his body. Turkey has not publicly presented evidence for its accusations, such as an audio recording Turkish officials say captured Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cWe have shared the evidence with our friends and allies, including the United States,\u201d Erdogan wrote on Friday.\n\nErdogan\u2019s government has demanded the extradition of the 18 suspects and in recent days accused Saudi officials of obstructing the investigation by withholding key evidence, including the location of Khashoggi\u2019s body. Erdogan also wrote that it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d that the Saudis had taken no action against Mohammed al-Otaibi, the Saudi consul general in Istanbul, who reportedly left Turkey two weeks after Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nThe latest Turkish recriminations came as Saudi Arabia received support from an unlikely ally \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Friday described the killing of Khashoggi as \u201chorrendous\u201d but warned against any response that would destabilize the political status quo in Riyadh.\n\nIsrael had been publicly silent during the global firestorm over Khashoggi\u2019s death, although Western officials say that, behind the scenes, it has told the Trump administration that Saudi Arabia is an important strategic partner in a region where U.S. policy is focused on countering Iran.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the Istanbul consulate was horrendous, and it should be duly dealt with,\u201d Netanyahu said, speaking in the Bulgarian town of Varna. \u201cYet at the same time I say it, it is very important for the stability of the world, for the region and for the world, that Saudi Arabia remain stable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that a way must be found to achieve both goals,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the larger problem is Iran, and we have to make sure that Iran does not continue the malign activities.\u201d\n\n[Khashoggi death throws new light on Saudi prince\u2019s crackdown on dissent]\n\nNetanyahu has also made note of Israel\u2019s improving relations with Saudi Arabia, as well as several other Arab countries, in recent months. Sometimes this has come in reference to what he views as a shared strategic threat from Iran; other times he has mentioned it in the wider context of a regional peace plan that would bypass the Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s comments drew swift praise from Khalid bin Ahmad al-Khalifa, the foreign minister of Bahrain, which is a strong ally of Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a message posted to Twitter, Khalid said that the Israeli prime minister had \u201ca clear vision to the stability of the region and the role of Saudi Arabia to keep that stability.\u201d\n\nAnalysts suggested Friday that Netanyahu had decided to publicly back Saudi Arabia and Mohammed to encourage a sense of indebtedness in the future.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu also sees here an opportunity to score points with bin Salman in case he stays in power and continues to rule Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, the International Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst for Israeli-Palestinian issues. Such a display of public support for the crown prince at a sensitive political moment could have \u201csignificant potential gains down the line,\u201d Zalzberg said.\n\n[Turkey\u2019s justice minister warns \u2018no one can avoid responsibility\u2019 for Khashoggi killing]\n\nElsewhere, the fallout from Khashoggi\u2019s killing continued, with Norway saying that it had summoned its Saudi ambassador.\n\n\u201cWe have raised the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and presented our point of view to the Saudi ambassador several times after it was known,\u201d Ine Eriksen, the Norwegian foreign minister, said in a statement. \u201cWe underlined how seriously we take this issue.\u201d\n\nHuman rights groups also have escalated calls for action against the Saudi government, citing the chilling effect that Khashoggi\u2019s killing would have on rights defenders around the world.\n\nA letter to U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres signed by more than 100 writers, journalists, artists and activists called on Guterres to \u201cimmediately authorize an independent, international investigation into Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance and apparent murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf true, the murder of a journalist inside a diplomatic facility would constitute nothing less than an act of state terror intended to intimidate journalists, dissidents, and exiled critics the world over,\u201d it continued, according to PEN America, which distributed the letter.\n\nRuth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\n[WorldViews: Trump and the Saudis keep fumbling after Khashoggi\u2019s killing]\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "Opinion writer\n\nFor as long as I can remember, Republicans have branded themselves as the strong-on-defense party. They have supported increasing the military budget, reforms for the Department of Veterans Affairs and all manner of public tributes for the military. It\u2019s odd then that they should be so quiet as a president uses the military for purely political purposes just days from the critical midterm elections.\n\nI didn\u2019t hear the GOP leadership condemn the unnecessary deployment of 5,000 troops (make that as many as 15,000!) to the border. I didn\u2019t hear Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) denounce the notion that our troops should commit a war crime by firing on civilians if they threw rocks, as their commander in chief suggested.\n\nEven worse, self-professed lovers of the military such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the Democratic contender to fill Sen. Bob Corker\u2019s seat, are delighted about the move:\n\n\u201cI believe they will be a tremendous help in securing that border,\u201d she said. Blackburn was accompanied by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, on the trip. Sen. Cotton is no stranger to the 101st Airborne Division, after having served as a platoon leader with 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry in Iraq in 2006. He echoed Blackburn\u2019s assertion, saying, \u201cA nation has to defend its borders. That\u2019s a core element of sovereignty. We typically have Customs and Border Patrol on our borders to defend them, but when you face the kind of threat we do now with a unlawful caravan of thousands of people who\u2019ve already violated the borders of one country, Mexico, who claim that they\u2019re going to continue march on our border \u2026 then I support what the president is doing.\u201d\n\nWe should not be surprised; they\u2019re among the most ardent of President Trump\u2019s Republican apologists. (To his credit, Democratic Senate nominee and former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen sounded a note of sanity. \u201cWe\u2019re the most powerful nation in the world. A few thousand poor, unarmed people seeking asylum hardly presents a threat. It\u2019s full of women and children,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should process their requests in accordance with our laws.\u201d)\n\nIt was left to the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.); the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Adam Smith (Wash.); the House Homeland Security Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Bennie G. Thompson (Miss.); the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.); and 104 other House Democrats to write to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis objecting to the use of troops to further Trump\u2019s immigration plots \u201cwithout a long-term plan or an analysis of the effectiveness of previous deployments from this year.\u201d They demanded answers to basic questions, including \u201cWhat rules of engagement will troops be under with regard to individuals in the caravan or any other individuals approaching or coming across the southern border?\u201d and \u201cHow much will this deployment cost the American taxpayer?\u201d\n\nAside from Democrats, it was generally left to retired Republicans and ex-military members to condemn this outrageous politicization of the military. Former defense secretary and former Republican senator Chuck Hagel condemned the move: \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that he\u2019s using our military and our troops in a very political way. It really casts a lot of questions about the competency of his leadership.\u201d Meanwhile, retired Gen. Martin Dempsey tweeted:\n\nOur men and women in uniform are better trained, better equipped, and better led so they meet any threat with confidence. A wasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines would be made much worse if they use force disproportional to the threat they face. They won\u2019t. \u2014 GEN(R) Marty Dempsey (@Martin_Dempsey) November 1, 2018\n\nAnd former National Security Agency chief and CIA director Michael Hayden (a retired general) agreed with the sentiments of retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling:\n\nand that\u2019s right. And now lieutenants are forced to tell their troops, pay no attention to the commander in chief https://t.co/1ksOGt8abf \u2014 Gen Michael Hayden (@GenMhayden) November 1, 2018\n\nThe outrage from former national security officials and military men and women has for the first time ensnared Mattis, who had generally been credited with insulating the troops from the White House\u2019s harebrained schemes. CNN reports:\n\nAnger about the deployment and the perception that Mattis is allowing the military to be used for political purposes led one former Pentagon official to call for him to step down. \u201cThis is a craven political stunt by President Trump ahead of the US midterms, and a cynical capitulation by a secretary of defense who has prided himself on improving the readiness, focus and lethality of the US armed forces,\u201d Kelly Magsamen, a National Security Council official under both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, wrote in Defense One. \u201cIf Mattis does not believe the migrants are a threat that warrants tasking 5,000 active troops to the border, he should say so and resign,\u201d Magsamen wrote.\n\nMattis insists that \u201cwe don\u2019t do stunts.\u201d\n\nWhat is missing from the conversation is the chorus of Republican voices who regularly attacked prior presidents for perceived lack of support or respect for our military. Now, when the military\u2019s image as a nonpolitical, professional and law-abiding institution is gravely threatened, elected Republicans and candidates are mum at best or, at worst, supportive of Trump\u2019s stunt. Likewise, some self-described conservative think tankers are giving Trump cover. (\u201c\u2018The President and the administration wants to look like they are acting decisively \u2026 they want to appear strong. \u2026 The military is a quick way to respond to things in many cases,\u2019 Tom Spoehr, director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for National Defense and a US Army veteran said.\u201d)\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to turn his party against practically every principle and issue it once championed \u2014 fiscal discipline, free trade, robust legal immigration, human rights, respect for the military, belief in the rule of law, civility, objective reality \u2014 has, as many of us in the #NeverTrump contingent warned, thoroughly corrupted the right. Sincere conservatives who still cherish fiscal discipline, free trade, robust legal immigration, human rights, respect for the military, belief in the rule of law, civility and objective reality have no place in Trump\u2019s GOP, which is now the province of his cultists or worse, those who fake allegiance to advance their careers and maintain access to power.

Six countries agreed to \u201cgreatly reduced\u201d levels of oil purchases, he said, and two said they would soon end their imports of Iranian oil.\n\n\u201cSome of these will take a few months to get to zero,\u201d he told reporters in a conference call on the reimposition of sanctions. \u201cWe will give them a little longer to wind down. Weeks.\u201d\n\nThe United States is trying to force a worldwide ban on Iranian oil as it reimposes the sanctions that were suspended as part of the 2015 nuclear deal from which the United States withdrew in May. U.S. officials have vowed to block efforts to evade the prohibition by going after offenders with secondary sanctions.\n\n[Trump administration\u2019s use of sanctions draws concern]\n\nPompeo did not identify the countries and jurisdictions that will get waivers, other than to say the European Union is not among them. South Korea, Japan and India are expected to get a reprieve, however. All are among Iran\u2019s biggest oil customers, and they have argued that stopping their purchases immediately would cause oil prices to spike worldwide.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Energy Ministry announced Friday that it had been notified that the United States would grant the waiver Ankara had desperately sought to keep buying oil from its neighbor. Turkey relies on oil imports for its energy, and Iran is a major source.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the United States is prepared to impose sanctions on SWIFT, a financial messaging system used by banks for international transactions, if Iran is allowed to use it for any purpose other than humanitarian transactions. Under the restored sanctions, Iran will still be able to purchase goods such as food, agricultural commodities, medicine and medical devices.\n\n\u201cBut people need to be very careful these are real humanitarian transactions,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nAfter President Trump withdrew from the deal, which he had lambasted on the campaign trail, the United States gave countries and private businesses around the world 180 days to stop importing Iranian oil or face U.S. sanctions.\n\nSince the Trump administration came to office, it has imposed sanctions on 168 Iranian individuals, companies and groups 19 times. On Monday, Mnuchin said, it will add 700 names. Most of them are being relisted, though 300 of them are new to the list, he said.\n\nThough only a handful of countries support the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal, unilateral sanctions are highly effective because so many oil and financial transactions are conducted at least partially using U.S. dollars.\n\nThis round of sanctions targets Iranian oil, which provides the government with 80 percent of its revenue. It also affects shipping, insurance and financial transactions.\n\nIn August, the United States resumed sanctions prohibiting transactions involving U.S. dollars, Iranian automobiles and the purchase of commercial aircraft.\n\nThe administration says it does not seek a coup against the Islamic government but aims to pressure Tehran to renegotiate the nuclear deal and change its policies, including support for militias in the region and the development of ballistic missiles. But Pompeo has outlined a dozen demands, most of them unlikely to be met by Tehran and seen by critics as a call for Iran to capitulate.\n\n[A foiled assassination plot in Denmark may have just cost Iran a partner against Trump]\n\nOn Friday, Pompeo said the United States seeks a change in Iran\u2019s behavior toward its own people.\n\n\u201cWe are working toward the Iranian people having the opportunity to have the government they want,\u201d he said, \u201ca government that does not take their money and spend it on malign activities around the world.\u201d\n\nThe renewed hostility has pushed the Iranian economy to the brink of collapse, as its currency has lost about 70 percent of its value. Iran\u2019s oil imports have shrunk by about 1 million barrels a day, from a peak of 2.5 million. China has stepped up its purchases in recent months, apparently keeping them in storage.\n\nIran is expected to resort to subterfuge to keep its economy going. Some of its oil tankers already have turned off the electronic identity tags that keep track of where they are heading. The Europeans are establishing a special system that will essentially allow trade to continue with Iran through a form of barter, though they have had trouble getting a country to agree to host the exchange and risk U.S. sanctions.\n\nMuch of the impact of the renewed sanctions has already been baked in. Virtually all multinational corporations that do business in the United States have stopped doing business in Iran so as not to run afoul of the sanctions.\n\nMnuchin said he expects that the European attempt to develop an alternative system, allowing trade with Iran to continue, will ultimately fail.

On Thursday, CNN\u2019s eyes turned lustfully to her, as she again looked like a candidate for president \u2014 even though she\u2019s swatted away the notion ever since her electrifying speech at the Golden Globes in January revved up the speculation machine. At a performing arts center in Decatur, people waited in line for hours in a steady rain to breathe her air. The people who showed up were as you\u2019d expect: mostly black and mostly female, activists and retired teachers and grad-student campaign volunteers, ready to be in her majesty\u2019s thrall. There was a feeling that something\u2019s going on \u2014 maybe not in the South as a whole, but certainly in the Southeast, and certainly in the ever-bluer suburbs of Atlanta. These Georgians had phonebanked for Senate candidate Doug Jones last year, even though he was in Alabama. These Georgians had mobilized for congressional candidate Jon Ossoff, the Democrat who lost a special election but left behind an organizational infrastructure and a sense of momentum.\n\n\u201cI have this to say to you, black people with ancestors who never had the chance,\u201d Oprah said when she took the stage, her voice rising in force. \u201cWhen you sit at home, and your friends sit at home and don\u2019t go out to vote, you DISRESPECT YOUR ELDERS.\u201d\n\nOne of those elders, civil rights icon Rep.

Oprah, to her credit, ceded the spotlight when she called Abrams onto the stage, which had been furnished with a mini version of a talk-show set. Two armchairs, a coffee table with a flourish of white flora, and Oprah at her most pensive and profound, chin resting between her thumb and index finger, asking a very Oprah question:\n\n\u201cIf you had to surrender the dream you have for Georgia to the higher power that we call God, what is the dream for Georgia that you wish to surrender?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe poverty is immoral,\u201d Abrams replied to sustained applause. \u201cIt is a squandering of human capital. . . .

A week ago, he tweeted his frustration that it was \u201cvery unfortunate, what is going on\u201d with the attempted bombing of Democrats and CNN through the mail \u2014 not because of the bombs themselves but because \u201cthe momentum greatly slows\u201d for Republicans when the \u201cnews [is] not talking politics.\u201d\n\nAt a rally in Missouri on Thursday evening \u2014 one of about a dozen as Trump closes out the midterm cycle \u2014 he again complained about the loss of momentum for his party.\n\n\u201cTremendous numbers of Republicans are going out to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we did have two maniacs stop a momentum that was incredible, because for seven days nobody talked about the elections. It stopped a tremendous momentum.\u201d\n\nApparently realizing that focusing on the political effects of a mass killing wasn\u2019t a great look, he moderated his comments.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, we have to take care of our people, and we don\u2019t care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it did nevertheless stop a certain momentum, and now the momentum is picking up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the claim itself \u2014 that the mail bombs and the shooting curtailed voting \u2014 is incorrect. Democratic data firm TargetSmart has been tracking votes returned by day in early-voting states. In several major states, there was no apparent blip in turnout during the period between the first discovered bomb (Oct. 23) and the shooting. There was, in several states, a slowdown the day after the shooting, but that was a Sunday.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nDaniel Smith, chair of the political science department at the University of Florida, has broken down returned ballots by day in that state. His graphs show that the same period as above (we\u2019ve indicated it with a gray box) was the period during which Republican-returned ballots for the first time surged past the equivalent count in 2014.\n\nThe momentum, it seems, continued unabated.\n\nOn Google, where America turns for more information about what\u2019s on its mind, the shooting and the mail bombs each saw spikes in attention. Interest in the midterm elections, not huge, has been trending upward a bit as Election Day approaches, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have suffered as attention turned to the attacks.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nNotice that we\u2019ve also added a line showing search interest in \u201ccaravan,\u201d a reference to the migrant marchers headed north from southern Mexico. When Trump complains about no one talking about the election, it\u2019s clear that to a large extent he means that people aren\u2019t focused on the election issues he\u2019d like them to focus on. One of those, obviously, is this caravan; he\u2019s said in the past that it is one of the primary things that the midterms are (or should be) about.\n\nWhile search interest in the election didn\u2019t really drop, interest in the caravan did. At first, it was overtaken by the attempted mail bombings \u2014 \u201cthis \u2018Bomb\u2019 stuff,\u201d as Trump put it \u2014 and then, briefly, by the shooting. But in recent days Trump has again focused on the caravan, and interest in it has moved back up.\n\nThe more obvious way in which this manifests is in cable news coverage. On CNN and MSNBC, discussion of the election \u2014 and the caravan \u2014 waned during the period when discussion of the bombs and the shooting was increasing. Even on Fox News, caravan coverage was briefly overtaken by discussion about the shooting. (That wasn\u2019t really the case on Fox Business.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThis was the actual content of Trump\u2019s original complaint: \u201cnews not talking politics.\u201d The idea that attempted bombings or an anti-Semitic mass shooting aren\u2019t \u201cpolitics\u201d is more than debatable, especially since one of the last social media posts by the alleged shooter included a direct reference to the caravan as a rationale for the attack. Trump wants the news to focus on immigration and issues helpful to his party politically. He doesn\u2019t want it talking about fervent Trump supporters who allegedly sent bombs through the mail to people Trump had targeted with his rhetoric.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to lose sight of the most important part of Trump\u2019s comments. Even he recognized that talking about political momentum as a downside to mass killing and attempted mass killing was questionable. But that didn\u2019t stop him from doing so, both before and after claiming that \u201cwe don\u2019t care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country.\u201d\n\nClearly he does. A transcript of his speech shows that his comments about momentum and the \u201ctwo maniacs\u201d were the only reference to the bombing attempts or the shooting. He did, however, excoriate the \u201cfar left.\"\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone crazy, folks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone totally loco.\u201d", "Gunmen said to be from the Islamic State opened fire on a bus carrying worshipers returning from a remote Coptic Christian monastery in upper Egypt on Friday, killing at least eight and wounding 13, said a top religious leader and local officials.\n\n\u201cTerrorists opened fire on a bus carrying people,\u201d Coptic Christian Archbishop Makarious of Minya, a town roughly 150 miles south of Cairo, said in a phone interview. The pilgrims, said community leaders, were returning from a visit to Saint Samuel the Confessor Monastery in a remote patch of Egypt\u2019s western desert.\n\nSix of those killed were from the same family, according to a post on the Facebook page of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt.\n\nOn Friday evening, Egypt\u2019s Islamic State affiliate, which has vowed to target the nation\u2019s minority Coptic Christians, claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq news service. It was the first attack claimed by the militant group this year outside northern Sinai, where it is fighting Egyptian security forces. In a statement, the militants claimed that they had killed 13 and wounded 18, and that the attack was in response to the jailing of females they claim to be their supporters by the Egyptian government.\n\n[After Egypt church bombings, Israel closes southern border with Sinai]\n\nFriday\u2019s violence comes more than a year after a similar assault on Christian pilgrims traveling to the same monastery. In May 2017, gunmen attacked buses carrying worshipers, leaving at least 28 people dead. Since December 2017, the last major assault on Christians, there has been a relative lull in the targeting of the Coptic community. Friday\u2019s attack, many fear, could signal the launch of another deadly campaign by the Islamic State against Christians.\n\nPresident Abdel Fatah al-Sissi on Friday sought to allay the concerns of a community that has staunchly supported him, even as they have been under attack by Islamist extremists for the past two years. Egyptian officials and analysts view the Islamic State's targeting of Christians as an effort to expand beyond their traditional theater of operations in the northern Sinai and foment religious divisions among Egyptians.\n\n\u201cI mourn with deep sorrow the martyrs who were killed today by treacherous hands which aim to undermine the solid fabric of the nation, and I wish speedy recovery for the injured,\u201d Sissi said in a statement. \u201cI confirm our determination to continue our efforts to combat dark terrorism and apprehend the culprits.\u201d\n\n[Campaign against Islamic State in Egypt is creating a humanitarian crisis, rights group says]\n\nThe death toll Friday could have been much higher. There were several vehicles carrying Christian pilgrims, but the militants targeted two buses, said Bishop Aghathon Tala\u2019at, a Christian community leader. One bus escaped when its driver swerved onto another road. But the second bus, carrying at least 20 passengers, was stopped by the militants, who were in two SUVs, Tala\u2019at said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cA number of masked men got out of them, took the mobile phones of the passengers and then shot all the men dead,\u201d said Tala\u2019at, who is the bishop of Maghagha, a nearby town with a hospital where many of the wounded were treated. \u201cThey were wearing militarylike uniforms, survivors told me.\u201d\n\nImages of the bus distributed on social media showed a bloody scene, including a wounded child. The execution-style killings mirror the attack in May 2017 in which gunmen, also dressed in fatigues, killed some victims with single gunshots to the head.\n\nSince 2016, Islamic State suicide bombers in Egypt have targeted churches in Cairo, Alexandria and Tanta, killing scores. Last month, an Egyptian military court sentenced to death 17 people convicted in those attacks. The defendants were charged with belonging to the Islamic State and orchestrating the assaults on the Christian community, which makes up about 10 percent of the population.\n\n[Egypt launches major offensive against Islamic State militants]\n\nAttacks by the Islamic State prompted Sissi\u2019s government to launch a major military operation this year in Egypt\u2019s restive northern Sinai province, the stronghold of the militants. A wave of Islamist militancy has pervaded the country since the military overthrow of the elected president, Mohamed Morsi, and the subsequent crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood party\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe Islamic State has also targeted Sufi Muslims, which the group considers heretics. In November 2017, militants attacked a Sufi mosque in the northern Sinai, slaughtering more than 300 worshipers. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt\u2019s modern history.\n\nAfter every assault on the Christian community, Egypt\u2019s security forces bolster security around churches and other holy sites throughout the country. Friday\u2019s violence was an indicator to many that such measures have not worked.\n\nAfter the attack, Tala\u2019at said, some people angrily took to the streets and blocked a road, demanding better security for their community. The remote area in the western desert, where militant groups have long targeted Egyptian security forces, has poor cellphone reception and unpaved, often unlit roads.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a security solution,\u201d Tala\u2019at said. \u201cThe road is not paved well, there is not enough lightning, and there is no cell network, either. This is why it is targeted.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "A Pakistani cleric known as the \u201cfather of the Taliban\u201d was stabbed and shot to death in his home outside Islamabad on Friday, his family and aides said, amid ongoing violence days after a Christian woman was acquitted of blasphemy charges.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the slaying of Maulana Sami ul-Haq, 82, was related to the unrest.\n\nBut it added another volatile element during nationwide protests by Muslim groups angered at a ruling by Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday that acquitted a Christian woman on charges of blasphemy.

Swearinger has become one of the best safeties in the NFL. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nRedskins safety D.J. Swearinger struts across football fields with fists clenched, the same Bone Thugs-N-Harmony hook pounding through his head, wearing resentment like a pair of oversized shoulder pads. Burning in his chest is a volcano of slights, filled with all the voices of the doubters, the disbelievers and those who just don\u2019t understand. The rage rises, building, building, building until at last it erupts into a blast of spit and screams and flying hair.\n\nBoom!\n\nYou don\u2019t think D.J. Swearinger is the best safety in the NFL? Really, you don\u2019t? Because here he comes now, 205 pounds of muscle carved in the same Miami gym that molded the rippling arms of LeBron James, ready to make you realize you\u2019ve been hit by the NFL\u2019s top safety. No. 1. Get it?\n\nThat\u2019s D.J. Swearinger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thuggish, ruggish bone,\u201d Shatasha Williams sings on the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony song Swearinger plays on constant repeat.\n\n[Flexed Saturday Titans game adds to a challenging second-half schedule for Redskins]\n\nIn his mind he hears the Houston Texans coaches who didn\u2019t get him, the critics who called him a dirty player and the chorus of football experts who hardly seemed to know who he was. He seethes. He rages. Then he goes looking for another pass to intercept.\n\nHe wears his dead hero\u2019s rookie number, plays for his dead hero\u2019s NFL team, imagining every minute that he\u2019s prowling the secondary like Sean Taylor, hunting for a receiver to hit. And somewhere it occurs to him that at age 27, after all these years of fighting and fuming, he might actually be at exactly the right place, where people finally do get him, where everybody in football actually does know his name.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very driven man,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve set my mind to something I\u2019m going to do it and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to do it.\u201d\n\nFinally, he\u2019s made people notice. He\u2019s increasingly the face of a defense that ranks among the NFL\u2019s best and has fueled the Redskins' rise to first place in the NFC East. He is recognized as one of the best defensive backs in the game.\n\nBut even now, that often doesn\u2019t feel like enough. Like last week, when Pro Football Focus ranked Swearinger as the best safety in the league, because how could they not? After four interceptions, two forced fumbles, 26 solo tackles and a sack, it was impossible to ignore him anymore. But for some reason, the Pro Football Focus people didn\u2019t put his picture on the graphic they produced and then tweeted, listing the NFL\u2019s top five safeties. Swearinger tweeted back at them saying that he viewed it as a slight to not be pictured, and that he would be using it as motivation.\n\nHow could they have known, however, that Swearinger had been monitoring their rankings for years, always wondering why his name never appeared on their lists? How could they realize they were part of a vast cabal of Swearinger misanthropes who just weren\u2019t seeing the brilliance? When PFF didn\u2019t rank him as one of the NFL\u2019s top 10 safeties last season, he took a picture of the list and made it the background photo on his phone, looking at it every time he stepped into a workout. He would stomp through the gym, saying to himself, again and again: \u201cI\u2019m not even the top 10, I\u2019m not even the top 10. I\u2019m not even the top 10.\u201d\n\n[Redskins excited to add Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to a stout defense: \u2018We\u2019re going to be scary\u2019]\n\nHis trainer, David Alexander \u2014 whose clients at Miami\u2019s DBC Fitness include James, Wizards guard John Wall and a number of NFL stars, including Broncos edge rusher Von Miller and Eagles wide receiver Alshon Jeffery \u2014 says Swearinger might be the most-driven of anyone he works out.

I\u2019m going to be laughing and joking. When it\u2019s business, I\u2019m going to be about business, though, and that\u2019s the thing that scares people.\" (Photo by Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nFor more than a decade, Swearinger has been shaking people, trying to get them to notice. Back at Greenwood High School in Greenwood, S.C., where his school\u2019s three-time state championship winning coach Shell Dula told Swearinger he was one of the smartest players he had ever coached, Rivals thought he was nothing better than a three-star college prospect. During his senior year at South Carolina, he lit up the SEC only to be named second team all conference. Second team! He\u2019s still burning about that one.\n\nHe was a second-round pick in the 2013 draft, not a first, but dazzled the Houston Texans with a swashbuckling frenzy, knocking Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker to the ground in a joint practice, drawing a cascade of nasty words from Denver quarterback Peyton Manning. Not that Swearinger cared much for what Manning thought; he screamed back in Manning\u2019s face. Later that year, one of his hits ripped apart the knee of Dolphins tight end Dustin Keller, and that made people notice, but not in a good way. Some called him a dirty player.\n\nThe next year, Houston coach Gary Kubiak left for Denver, taking with him Vance Joseph, the defensive backs coach Swearinger loved. Kubiak\u2019s replacement, Bill O\u2019Brien, didn\u2019t seem to care for him. There was an argument with the new defensive backs coach, then an angry meeting with the two of them and O\u2019Brien, and then Swearinger\u2019s release at the end of 2014.\n\nWhat should have been a new start in Tampa Bay was ruined the first meeting with the Bucs coach at the time, Lovie Smith, who Swearinger says read to him a list of infractions passed on by the Houston staff. Lost, and certain he was being buried by the fraternity of NFL coaches, he left Tampa Bay midway through the 2015 season with a turf toe injury and wound up with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\n[The Redskins might now have the NFL\u2019s best safety duo. How will the two fit together?]\n\nUltimately, it was Cardinals coach Bruce Arians who brought him back, telling Swearinger he thought the player deserved another opportunity. Even still, after a year-and-a-half of pouring his fury into every play at Arizona, the Cardinals didn\u2019t re-sign him after the 2016 season, adding another layer to his motivation. It might have been the best thing that ever happened to him.\n\nHow can you know when you find the perfect place? Swearinger signed a three-year, $13 million contract with the Redskins before last year and immediately found a home. In some ways, he should have expected this. He was coming to the team where Taylor starred, wearing Taylor\u2019s rookie number and dressing in a locker that is eerily close to the one Taylor used in the old configuration of the team\u2019s remodeled practice facility.\n\nHe had four interceptions and a forced fumble last season, but it is this year in which he has finally blown up. The player hated by coaches in Houston and barely wanted in Tampa Bay has become a leader in Washington, one of the most essential voices on a team that has quickly grown up.\n\nThe Redskins hear it in their locker room when he rants against teammates acting too carefree in the days after victories. The players feel it in impassioned locker room speeches. Everybody sees it in those pregame huddles when he screams louder and louder and louder, channeling another hero \u2014 Ray Lewis, whose dance he used to do before high school games \u2014 surprising even himself when he watches later on film.\n\n\u201cWe need to be our brother\u2019s keeper today!\u201d he shouted before the win over Green Bay. \u201cI\u2019m your brother\u2019s keeper! You\u2019re my brother\u2019s keeper! Ain\u2019t nobody today but us, man!\u201d\n\nLater, when he saw this, he smiled. He had no memory of what he had bellowed. The words just came out.\n\n\u201cThere was some really good stuff in there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, that was a good one.\u201d\n\nSometimes you really do find the right place.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always like that,\u201d cornerback Quinton Dunbar says of Swearinger. \u201cThat ain\u2019t no front, that ain\u2019t no switch on, that\u2019s just how he is on and off the field.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, a lot of players talk about wanting to be great,\u201d says Swearinger's trainer. \u201cThey say: \u2018I want to secure the [big contract] and I want to be the greatest. But he doesn\u2019t just talk about it. He says: \u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019\u201d (Photo by Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nIt\u2019s taken time, but there is growth in that frenzy you see from Swearinger. The player who rages on the field and burns for you to see his football brilliance actually has a friendly smile. He pulls gently at his braids when he sits for conversations. He worries that people might get the wrong idea, that he\u2019s some crazed monster of a man.\n\n\u201cThey see the fiery guy on the field and they think I\u2019m just a fiery guy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m just a fun guy to be around. I\u2019m going to be laughing and joking. When it\u2019s business, I\u2019m going to be about business, though, and that\u2019s the thing that scares people. When I\u2019m all business, man, especially on game days and close to game days, I\u2019m a fiery guy. I talk a lot of trash and a lot of people say, \u2018he talks a lot of trash, man.\u2019 I\u2019m just being me on the field. There\u2019s no bad meaning to it.\u201d\n\nThen he says this.\n\n\u201cI feel like I had a lot of growing up to do, for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Houston taught me a lot. Even Tampa.\u201d\n\nThere are years of lessons he brought with him to Washington, like how to watch game film, which he now puts on the big laser screen he had installed in his home theater. He makes his girlfriend watch, too, expecting her to learn the nuances of his position so she can coach him. His 18-month-old son and two-month-old daughter are also in the room. In D.J. Swearinger\u2019s world, everyone is going to learn to be the best safety in the NFL.\n\n[Sign up for Dan Steinberg's daily D.C. Sports Bog newsletter for Capitals, Nationals, Redskins and Wizards coverage]\n\nHe got the lesson in hard work from his parents, Robert and Orma, who had him as high schoolers, raising him with his grandmother while Orma went to college and Robert worked at the Greenwood Fabricating and Plating plant during the day and drove deliveries for Pizza Hut at night. Only after Orma graduated from school and got a science job did money come in.\n\nAs for the fire for everyone to understand he\u2019s the best? Well, that was all him, going back to high school, back when Rivals gave him those three stars. He taped the word \u201cRespect\u201d on his helmet, so he could remind himself every day how hard he had to push.\n\nNot long after, looking for inspiration, he found a grainy video on YouTube, a highlight reel of Sean Taylor\u2019s greatest hits his rookie year with the Redskins. In the background, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony thumped.\n\nIt\u2019s the thuggish, ruggish booooooooooonnnnne.\n\nHe started watching that video before every game in college, then Houston then Tampa Bay then Arizona and finally Washington \u2014 No. 36 in a Redskins jersey carrying his own rage, knocking men off their feet. Seeing it now, everything makes sense.\n\nHe just had to find the right place.

The pilgrims, said community leaders, were returning from a visit to Saint Samuel the Confessor Monastery in a remote patch of Egypt\u2019s western desert.\n\nSix of those killed were from the same family, according to a post on the Facebook page of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt.\n\nOn Friday evening, Egypt\u2019s Islamic State affiliate, which has vowed to target the nation\u2019s minority Coptic Christians, claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq news service. It was the first attack claimed by the militant group this year outside northern Sinai, where it is fighting Egyptian security forces. In a statement, the militants claimed that they had killed 13 and wounded 18, and that the attack was in response to the jailing of females they claim to be their supporters by the Egyptian government.\n\n[After Egypt church bombings, Israel closes southern border with Sinai]\n\nFriday\u2019s violence comes more than a year after a similar assault on Christian pilgrims traveling to the same monastery. In May 2017, gunmen attacked buses carrying worshipers, leaving at least 28 people dead. Since December 2017, the last major assault on Christians, there has been a relative lull in the targeting of the Coptic community. Friday\u2019s attack, many fear, could signal the launch of another deadly campaign by the Islamic State against Christians.\n\nPresident Abdel Fatah al-Sissi on Friday sought to allay the concerns of a community that has staunchly supported him, even as they have been under attack by Islamist extremists for the past two years. Egyptian officials and analysts view the Islamic State's targeting of Christians as an effort to expand beyond their traditional theater of operations in the northern Sinai and foment religious divisions among Egyptians.\n\n\u201cI mourn with deep sorrow the martyrs who were killed today by treacherous hands which aim to undermine the solid fabric of the nation, and I wish speedy recovery for the injured,\u201d Sissi said in a statement. \u201cI confirm our determination to continue our efforts to combat dark terrorism and apprehend the culprits.\u201d\n\n[Campaign against Islamic State in Egypt is creating a humanitarian crisis, rights group says]\n\nThe death toll Friday could have been much higher. There were several vehicles carrying Christian pilgrims, but the militants targeted two buses, said Bishop Aghathon Tala\u2019at, a Christian community leader. One bus escaped when its driver swerved onto another road. But the second bus, carrying at least 20 passengers, was stopped by the militants, who were in two SUVs, Tala\u2019at said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cA number of masked men got out of them, took the mobile phones of the passengers and then shot all the men dead,\u201d said Tala\u2019at, who is the bishop of Maghagha, a nearby town with a hospital where many of the wounded were treated. \u201cThey were wearing militarylike uniforms, survivors told me.\u201d\n\nImages of the bus distributed on social media showed a bloody scene, including a wounded child. The execution-style killings mirror the attack in May 2017 in which gunmen, also dressed in fatigues, killed some victims with single gunshots to the head.\n\nSince 2016, Islamic State suicide bombers in Egypt have targeted churches in Cairo, Alexandria and Tanta, killing scores. Last month, an Egyptian military court sentenced to death 17 people convicted in those attacks. The defendants were charged with belonging to the Islamic State and orchestrating the assaults on the Christian community, which makes up about 10 percent of the population.\n\n[Egypt launches major offensive against Islamic State militants]\n\nAttacks by the Islamic State prompted Sissi\u2019s government to launch a major military operation this year in Egypt\u2019s restive northern Sinai province, the stronghold of the militants. A wave of Islamist militancy has pervaded the country since the military overthrow of the elected president, Mohamed Morsi, and the subsequent crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood party\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe Islamic State has also targeted Sufi Muslims, which the group considers heretics. In November 2017, militants attacked a Sufi mosque in the northern Sinai, slaughtering more than 300 worshipers. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt\u2019s modern history.\n\nAfter every assault on the Christian community, Egypt\u2019s security forces bolster security around churches and other holy sites throughout the country. Friday\u2019s violence was an indicator to many that such measures have not worked.\n\nAfter the attack, Tala\u2019at said, some people angrily took to the streets and blocked a road, demanding better security for their community. The remote area in the western desert, where militant groups have long targeted Egyptian security forces, has poor cellphone reception and unpaved, often unlit roads.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a security solution,\u201d Tala\u2019at said. \u201cThe road is not paved well, there is not enough lightning, and there is no cell network, either. This is why it is targeted.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "", "\n\nEarly sunsets can be beautiful. November 2014. (Richard Barnhill via Flickr)\n\nSometimes it seems like time is standing still. And once a year, time even goes backward. That time comes this Sunday at 2 a.m., when we \u201cfall back\u201d and set our watches an hour earlier to 1 a.m. The occasion marks the annual transition from daylight saving time to standard time.\n\nAlthough the time change means an extra hour of sleep for those of us fortunate enough to take advantage of such a thing, it comes with a price, and that price is earlier sunsets.\n\nSaturday night, the sun dips below the horizon at 6:05 p.m. in Washington. Fast forward to Sunday, and the light disappears at 5:04 p.m. Farther north, up in Boston, sunset is even earlier -- just after 4:30 p.m. following the switch, while twilight will fall on Philly at 4:54 p.m. Sunday.\n\nWhere\u2019s that chunk of daytime going? You\u2019ll notice it when the sun rises an hour earlier in the morning.\n\nThe amount of daylight we see naturally shrinks every autumn. This is thanks to the earth\u2019s 23.5-degree tilt on its axis. During the summer, those of us in the Northern Hemisphere lean toward the sun and remain bathed in sunlight longer. In winter, that slant works against us. Daylight wanes, darkness creeps closer, and the days shorten until the winter solstice. On that day, regions north of the Arctic Circle never witness a sunrise.\n\nOver the next month, D.C. will lose another 50 minutes of daylight. At peak darkness for the year, the sun will shine only for a mere 9 hours and 26 minutes -- rising at 7:23 a.m. and plunging below the horizon at 4:49 p.m. For comparison, Washington remains sunlit for a whopping 14 hours and 53 minutes on the summer solstice in June!\n\nCloser to the equator, that summer to winter change in sunlight isn\u2019t quite as dramatic. Take Miami, for example. Sunset there shifts up to 5:30 p.m. in December, but doesn\u2019t get past 8:16 p.m. in July. The farther poleward one goes, the greater the range in annual daylight between seasons, but regions nearer the equator boast a greater annual average of daylight.\n\n\n\nAn example of how light changes over the course of a year. (Iowa Environmental Mesonet)\n\nThis whole clock shift partly stems from a time when we had a much more agricultural-based populace in the United States. Many believed that an hour of daylight in the morning was more valuable to farming and industry than one tacked on to the end of the workday. In the summertime, that hour isn\u2019t overly important. During the darker months as winter approaches, sunlight is in short supply, and that hour is in high demand.\n\nIn some fashion, it also dates back to a thought experiment by famed inventor and founding father Benjamin Franklin. He calculated that the city of Paris could save 64 million pounds of candle wax in six month if residents worked with the sun instead of sleeping late into the day after a night of recreation. Franklin is known for his iconic adage \u201cearly to bed, early to rise / makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\u201d\n\nPort Arthur, Ontario, became the first city in the world to ratify daylight saving time back on July 1, 1908.\n\nThe idea quickly caught on across Europe and was adopted by the United States on March 19, 1918. But it didn\u2019t stick around long here. Congress abolished it after World War I and overrode President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s veto. DST remained on the bike rack until Feb. 9, 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted \u201cWar Time.\u201d Some communities latched on to the idea, and others didn\u2019t. Finally, on April 13, 1966, Congress sought to eliminate inconsistencies and passed the Uniform Time Act. Daylight saving time has been with us ever since.\n\nTime shifting is still mired in some controversy. Many would prefer a brighter evening than morning. There is even some literature to suggest that year-round daylight time (what we have in the summer) would combat the incidence of seasonal affective disorder, a darkness-driven melancholy whose depressive onset often follows the time change.\n\nYears of deeply rooted tradition stand in the way of any change to this practice today. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has been leading his state\u2019s efforts to remain on daylight saving time throughout the year. The Sunshine State\u2019s proposal appears likely to be struck down by Congress in the weeks ahead.", "", "President Trump demands loyalty from everyone around him. And his method of obtaining it is often unorthodox: by forcing people to sign off on \u2014 or even vouch for \u2014 his most controversial and nonsensical ideas. The people in his orbit almost always do, to one extent or another, because the alternative is undercutting the president of the United States. Once they\u2019ve bought in, their fate is more tied to his.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis has to this point largely avoided such an arrangement. Speaking in public infrequently, he has earned a reputation as a bipartisan, steadying force within the administration. And with Nikki Haley\u2019s impending exit as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, he\u2019s set to be the most popular and reputable Cabinet official left.\n\nBut Mattis\u2019s tolerance is now being tested \u2014 as is his reputation.\n\nMattis earlier this week vouched for Trump\u2019s decision to send 5,200 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to contend with the caravan of migrants that started in Honduras. Critics have alleged it\u2019s a thinly veiled electoral ploy in which the Pentagon is now complicit, but Mattis rejected that criticism in no uncertain terms.\n\n\u201cThe support that we provide to the secretary for Homeland Security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t do stunts in this department.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do stunts in this department.\u201d Translation: We\u2019re not letting Trump use us for political gain.\n\nSince Mattis uttered those words Wednesday, though, Trump has upped the ante even more. Just a couple of hours later, Trump floated the idea of sending as many as 15,000 military personnel to the border \u2014 a number that would far outstrip even the number of migrants in the caravan and would also rival the number of troops in Afghanistan.\n\nThen, on Thursday, Trump suggested that those troops should respond to any rocks being thrown their way by shooting at the caravan. \u201cIf they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe're going to consider \u2014 and I told them, consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say, consider it a rifle.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion isn\u2019t serious. Even if the military wanted to respond to such provocations with deadly force and wasn\u2019t worried about creating an international incident, it doesn\u2019t broadly have the authority to engage in law enforcement \u2014 much less combat \u2014 on U.S. soil. Its role, legally speaking, is one of support for existing agents. It can\u2019t technically do much the National Guard, which had previously been marked for deployment, couldn\u2019t do.\n\nThat\u2019s a big part of why this is viewed as a stunt \u2014 with the other main ones being that the military is being deployed with the caravan still 900 miles and weeks away, and also that such caravans generally are aimed at legally requesting asylum rather than crossing the border illegally. Trump\u2019s rhetoric that this constitutes an \u201cinvasion\u201d or that we have an immigration \u201ccrisis\u201d simply isn\u2019t backed up by the facts.\n\nTrump\u2019s overzealous rhetoric has made clear, at the least, that he is trying to leverage this for political gain. Whether the deployment of the military itself is an unwarranted piece of that effort is for reasonable people to disagree about.\n\nBut Mattis has now bought into the idea that it\u2019s not. And Trump seems bent upon making him regret it.", "\n\nAn overflow crowd was outside Adas Israel synagogue in Northwest Washington on Monday for an interfaith service to mourn the 11 Jews killed Saturday at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nCNN reports:\n\nA new campaign is encouraging Americans of all faiths to visit synagogues for Shabbat services Friday and Saturday as a show of strength and love against hate. Launched by the American Jewish Committee, a global Jewish advocacy organization, the #ShowUpForShabbat campaign is a reaction to last Saturday\u2019s massacre, when 11 worshipers were gunned down at a synagogue in one of Pittsburgh\u2019s most vibrant Jewish communities. \u201cI encourage all members of the Jewish community and all people of conscience across our country to join me,\u201d AJC CEO David Harris said in a statement. \u201cWhat could be a more fitting response to the terror in Pittsburgh?\u201d\n\nI had to laugh, just a little, in recognition that outside the Orthodox movement, rabbis \u2014 probably since the Second Temple was destroyed \u2014 have been on a never-ending quest to get congregants to show up for Shabbat services. Hence, the array of techniques to lure congregants \u2014 Friday night dinners and Saturday lunches, themed services, special guests, kids services, family-led services, outdoor services and so on. You get the picture.\n\nBut in the aftermath of arguably the worst tragedy to befall American Jewry since the Holocaust, people were being invited for all of the right reasons and without gimmicks. In this case, the organized (sort of) Jewish community (which some Jews harp, often focuses on Israel and cultural Judaism rather than religious observance) has confirmed what rabbis and congregants have known for a couple millennia: Judaism is a communal religion, not a solitary one, and the ritual observances of mourning play a critical role in emotional and spiritual healing. (To say the Jewish prayer for mourning, Kaddash, a minyan, that is 10 adult Jews, must be present; no one should mourn alone.) That\u2019s what the Jewish community is in need of these days \u2014 healing.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that Jews who associate with the various denominations (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstruction) as well as nonobservant Jews and unaffiliated Jews (not members of a specific synagogue) feel so united. The reason is horribly simple: It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of Jew you are when the anti-Semites are looking for someone to kill.\n\nEven before sundown on Friday (the start of Shabbat), synagogues and other Jewish institutions have been holding vigils, saying Kaddish for the 11 murdered Jews and Misheberach (the Jewish prayer for healing) for those injured (physically, emotionally and spiritually). Now communities all over the country Friday night and Saturday are asking Jews and non-Jews to show up in solidarity with the Pittsburgh Jewish community.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare moment of unity as we trudge through the final days of a dispiriting, divisive effort by the president \u2014 fresh from his appearance in Pittsburgh \u2014 to enrage and scare Americans. The #ShowUpFor Shabbat is a timely reminder that politics should not, and for most of us, is not the be-all and end-all of life. Politicians and their most intense supporters and media camps are engaged in vicious battles but the rest of the country perhaps is more amenable to, hungry even for, solidarity and neighborliness.\n\nA New York-based rabbi who rushed to Pittsburgh wrote about a community vigil there of 2,500 people (with 1,000 more outside) on Sunday, the day after the shooting:\n\nWhat a profound declaration that night was of the most inspiring parts of the American family. What was displayed was a radically different picture of America than we might experience through the echo chambers of our social media channels. Politicians, pastors, and community leaders spoke. Philanthropists, presidential advisers, and senators were present but they sat silently and listened. A Baptist choir sang. Wasi Mohamed, the executive director of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, spoke and shared how his community had raised upwards of $70,000 [that figure is now close to $200,000] to benefit the synagogue community. He offered to stand guard in front of the synagogue imploring the Jewish community: tell us what we can do for you. Bill Peduto, the Pittsburgh Mayor described his city as one of refuge to all who seek to enter peacefully. And through tears, the rabbis of the various congregations all housed at the synagogue site spoke and described their murdered community members lovingly. The evening closed with musicians from the city\u2019s philharmonic performing a song from the Holocaust.\n\nThe rabbi concluded, \u201cThe America I witnessed that night was a vision of the beloved community, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. so often preached about. That America was in full display: big-hearted, tolerant of difference, passionate and compassionate.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what Jews and non-Jews are hoping to keep alive this Shabbat \u2014 a loving, inclusive and peaceful America.

He said this:\n\nThe Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien. Even if they\u2019ve been on our soil for a mere matter of seconds. Hundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants are made automatic citizens of the United States every year, because of this crazy lunatic policy that we can end. And they\u2019re all made instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of American citizenship. All of you, you get nothing more than they do. They\u2019re full citizens. And it\u2019s costing us many, many billions of dollars a year.\n\nThe part of this quote that generated attention was his description of \u201cthis crazy lunatic policy,\u201d because he was actually talking about a constitutional right. But there\u2019s something just as pernicious embedded in this riff: the idea that all these children of undocumented immigrants are \u201ccosting us many, many billions of dollars a year.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly awful about this claim is that he\u2019s talking about U.S. citizens. And he\u2019s asking his supporters to see those U.S. citizens as being in direct competition with them for the country\u2019s spoils and resources.\n\nTrump, of course, regularly makes variations on this claim about undocumented immigrants. He inflates them into a uniformly menacing and destructive presence with lies about how they bring outsize crime and pose an economic threat to Americans. But in this case, he\u2019s applying the claim to their U.S. citizen children \u2014 they cost us, and so they should not be granted the privileges of American citizenship that you are granted, because this deprives you of what is yours.\n\nWhen Trump bellowed out that \u201cwe can end\u201d this \u201cpolicy,\u201d the rally crowd roared with approval.\n\nThis whole framing casts the children of undocumented immigrants as undeserving of American citizenship purely on the basis of the background of their parents. That, of course, is the whole point of the push to end birthright citizenship \u2014 and precisely why it runs so flagrantly counter to the spirit and values at the core of this provision of our constitution.\n\nAs Garrett Epps puts it, at the heart of birthright citizenship is a fundamental conception of civic equality that ideally extends it to all Americans born here, regardless of race or the heritage of their parents. Ending it, Epps notes, \u201cwould create a shadow population of American-born people who have no state, no legal protection, and no real rights that the government is bound to respect.\u201d Given who their parents are, for Trump, this is a feature, not a bug. Trump is casting this entire class of people as undeserving of citizenship, as only deserving of this shadow status.\n\nUnderlying this push to end birthright citizenship is a form of virulent xenophobic ethno-nationalism that seeks to roll back the country\u2019s evolving racial and ethnic mix, something Trump confirmed with his private \u201cs\u2014hole countries\u201d comment. But Trump can\u2019t say this out loud. Thus he is now applying to these U.S. citizens the same argument he has long applied to undocumented immigrants: They, too, are a menace to your economic well-being. They will take what\u2019s yours.\n\nDaniel Dale, who tracks Trump\u2019s lies assiduously, tells me he first heard this \u201cbillions\u201d claim this week, as Trump \u201chas begun talking about birthright citizenship in a sustained manner for the first time as president.\u201d The complication here is: How do you even check such a claim? Do you tally up all the taxpayer-funded services these U.S. citizens avail themselves of? Do you factor in the contributions of their undocumented parents? What about these children\u2019s contributions when they become adults?\n\nCan you even fact-check this claim in the first place without inevitably validating Trump\u2019s ugly underlying premise \u2014 that this whole class of U.S. citizens is somehow less entitled to the benefits of being American because of who their parents are?\n\nAs Dale put it to me, it\u2019s a \u201cconstant challenge for fact checkers\u201d to figure out how to handle \u201cextremely vague claims for which he has not provided any evidence.\u201d The uncheckability of Trumpisms such as these are arguably the whole point of them, since, at bottom, Trump is telling a story, one that he knows will thrill his supporters, one that is supposed to remain beyond the reach of rational scrutiny.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the right language for the Trump era\n\nIn all kinds of ways, Trump is testing our ability to find the right language to describe our current moment. We struggle to capture the relentless lying about even the most trivial, easily verifiable matters; the nonstop racism and xenophobia and misogyny; the all-around deep rot of bad faith that\u2019s eating away at just about everything Trump says and at so much of what his administration does.\n\nOur language perpetually comes up short. On this final round of campaign demagoguery, with Trump hyping destitute migrants hundreds of miles away into a national emergency, and even sending in troops as props to sustain this monstrous fiction, we keep hearing that Trump is \u201cfearmongering\u201d or \u201cstoking division\u201d or \u201cexploiting racial and cultural tensions.\u201d This blog has used these terms regularly. But they feel, in some sense, deeply inadequate.\n\nSo I propose the term \u201chate narratives.\u201d If you have a better one, I\u2019m all ears.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: Don\u2019t fall for Trump\u2019s desperate, race-baiting birthright citizenship stunt\n\nWalter Dellinger: Trump wants to trash a fundamental American principle\n\nHarry Litman: Trump\u2019s troop buildup at the border violates centuries of Anglo-American law\n\nJennifer Rubin: 5,000 . . . 15,000 . . .

(Courtesy of Whole Foods)\n\n\u201cHanging out at a supermarket on a weekend night\u201d is not something you\u2019d expect to see in a city with a bustling bar and dining scene. Maybe in the suburbs, if the other nearby options are chain restaurants. But in Washington? And only a few minutes walk from Bluejacket, Chloe, All-Purpose and Salt Line?\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, there were few seats available at the South Capitol Hill Whole Foods, which opened Oct. 19, in a corner of Southeast Washington that\u2019s not quite the Navy Yard and not quite Capitol Hill. The truth is, there are plenty of reasons to head to this new grocery store beyond your weekly shopping.\n\nSelf-serve wine\n\nDon\u2019t want to wait for a bartender to pour you a glass of ros\u00e9? Feeling indecisive and want to taste a variety of wines? Just don\u2019t like talking to people? The Self-Serve Wine Bar automatically dispenses 16 options in one, three or six-ounce pours. Purchase a reloadable card from the bartender, slide it into in the fancy Enomatic wine storage machine, and press a button above your bottle of choice. That\u2019s it.\n\nOn recent visits, wines started at $2 for a one-ounce splash and went as high as $19 for six ounces of Ridge East Bench zinfandel. There are tasting notes on the by-the-glass menu, if you need to know more before dropping that kind of coin on one glass of wine. (Disclosure: Whole Foods is owned by Amazon.com. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post, but we still have to pay $19 for our wine like anyone else.)\n\nAnd yes, you can carry a glass in the store while you \u201csip and shop,\u201d but it\u2019s also fine to grab a seat at a table and hang out with friends, or open your laptop and get work done (with free WiFi, no less).\n\nInexpensive local craft beer\n\nCraft beer can be expensive. The South Capitol Hill Whole Foods has a dozen taps \u2014 including one cider \u2014 and almost everything costs $5 a pint. Not $5 for a 12-ounce goblet, but $5 for a 16-ounce glass. There are exceptions, such as Union\u2019s Double Duckpin Double IPA, which was $5 for eight ounces (in fancy stemware), but last weekend, 9 out of 12 offerings were only $5. Also a plus: Everything was made in Washington, Maryland or Virginia, with RAR (Cambridge) and Stone (Richmond) the breweries that are farthest away.\n\n\n\nThe newest gimmick at Whole Foods: pouring your own glasses of wine to enjoy at the store or while you shop.\n\nHappy hour\n\nYes, there is happy hour: $1 off pints of beer and glasses of wine from 4 to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday. While it ends on the early side, it\u2019s one of the cheapest options in the neighborhood.\n\nWings, cheesesteaks and other delicious things\n\nWhole Foods has partnered with local restaurateurs at other D.C. locations, including Erik Bruner-Yang, whose Paper Horse concept appears at Foggy Bottom and H Street, and Kazuhiro \u201cKaz\u201d Okochi of Kaz Sushi Bistro, whose sushi appears at multiple locations, including South Capitol Hill. The headliner at the new store is Philly Wing Fry, created by former \u201cTop Chef\u201d contestant Kwame Onwuachi, now at the Wharf\u2019s Kith and Kin.\n\nPhilly Wing Fry debuted as a pop-up at Union Market in 2016, before the chef\u2019s Shaw Bijou famously opened, crashed and burned. While the three menu items \u2014 cheesesteaks, wings and waffle fries \u2014 are found at carry-outs across the city, these are the Bentley versions. The cheesesteak is made with 50-day-aged rib-eye and smoked provolone, topped with pickled and caramelized onions, and served on bread cooked in beef fat. The tamarind-glazed wings are smothered in a sweet and sultry mumbo sauce. Waffle fries are tossed in Ethiopian berbere spice. Naturally, you pay for this: A combo box with a seven-inch sub, four wings and a pile of fries is $20, though it\u2019s more filling and more likely to be raved about to friends than some similarly priced meals.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d rather have a salad, pasta, sushi or a slice of pizza, you can pick that up, too, and bring it to the bar. Creative types can customize dinner at the build-your-own Avocado Toast Bar before pairing it with something from the pour-your-own wine station.

(Mehdi Fedouach/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThis week, Lime, one of the nation\u2019s largest electric-scooter companies, said the company pulled thousands of its scooters off the streets this summer because a small number of defective batteries had the potential to catch fire.\n\nThe batteries were fire-prone, the company said, because of a welding issue that caused them to short-circuit.\n\nResponding to Lime in a statement to The Washington Post on Thursday night, Segway \u2014 the personal-transportation company responsible for producing Lime\u2019s batteries \u2014 disputed the scooter company\u2019s claims and stood by its manufacturing process.\n\nSegway said its engineers who specialize in battery technology conclude that faulty welding \u201cwill typically stop a battery from charging or discharging, but it\u2019s highly unlikely to cause a battery to short circuit.\u201d Welding is utilized to place a conductor on Segway batteries that manages the flow of electricity.\n\n\u201cOver the years we have sold multiple millions of Segway\u2019s self balancing vehicles and a million kickscooters, all of which used the same battery technology without such incidents,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cWe cannot agree with Lime\u2019s diagnosis stated in the article. We think the statement was not based on a good understanding of battery technology.\u201d\n\nSegway put out its own statement Friday morning making similar points.\n\n[Electric scooter giant Lime says it recalled scooters amid fears that some could catch on fire]\n\nAsked to comment on Segway\u2019s statement, a Lime spokesman said the company still maintains their scooter\u2019s fire hazard stemmed from a manufacturing problem.\n\n\u201cSegway\u2019s assertions aside, even the slightest risk \u2014 and we do believe that the risk is small \u2014 from their batteries requires putting the safety of our Lime community first\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe look forward to working with Segway to rule out any safety issues and restore our confidence in their product. Until then, we stand by our decision and rationale.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions from The Washington Post about scooters catching fire earlier this week, Lime had previously said some of the welding surrounding its defective batteries may have had weak spots, causing the batteries to short.\n\nTony Ho, Segway\u2019s vice president of global business development, said Segway\u2019s batteries are certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), a company that independently tests the safety of lithium-ion batteries. UL did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ho said Segway produced about 1 million electric scooters this year alone, about 10 percent of which were sold to Lime. The company supplies electric scooters and batteries to about 30 scooter companies, including giants such as Bird, he said.\n\n\u201cWe take Lime\u2019s fire issue very, very seriously,\u201d Ho said. \u201cWe actually went to all of our shared scooter partners, and so far we\u2019ve found that only the Lime operation has had fire incidents.\u201d\n\nHo pointed to what engineers and company officials believe is a more likely culprit for Lime\u2019s battery woes: improper charging and maintenance.\n\nAs Instagram pages such as Bird Graveyard have documented, Ho said, electric scooters all over the country undergo \u201csubstantial abuse\u201d from customers. He said it\u2019s possible that any defective Lime scooter batteries had become damaged after being involved in crashes or subjected to abuse. Batteries can also catch fire if they\u2019re overcharged or don\u2019t use Segway-issued charging devices. An employee who charges scooters with the wrong equipment, Ho said, could damage scooter batteries.\n\nBecause external cases that hold Lime scooter batteries often sustain damage from vehicles hitting the ground and colliding with objects, Ho said it\u2019s \u201ceven more important for the shared-scooter companies to put in place guidelines for proper operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese scooters are involved in a commercial operation,\u201d Ho said. \u201cWithout proper training and a way to manage your contractors \u2014 or \u2018Juicers,\u2019 as Lime labels them \u2014 it\u2019s actually going to be very difficult to make sure all the safety practices are followed.\u201d\n\nHo added that Segway is working closely with Lime to resolve technical questions about malfunctioning batteries.\n\n[Scooter use is rising in major cities. So are trips to the emergency room.]\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Lime said that it learned in August that a \u201cmanufacturing defect\u201d in some of its scooters \u201ccould result in the battery smoldering, or in some cases catching fire.\u201d The only known case where a Lime scooter caused a fire was at the company\u2019s Lake Tahoe facility on Aug. 27.\n\nThe company\u2019s statement came in response to questions from The Post about Lime\u2019s scooters catching on fire. Although company officials said in an interview that Lime recalled about 2,000 scooters in Los Angeles, San Diego and Lake Tahoe, they said the risk of smoldering and fires was real in only a tiny percentage of cases. The company said it took off the streets the much larger number out of caution.\n\nLime also acknowledged that it has received an unconfirmed report that another scooter model it uses \u201cmay also be vulnerable to battery failure.\u201d\n\nIn its statement this week, Lime said that, moving forward, Segway Ninebot scooters will be charged only at Lime\u2019s \u201cscooter storage facilities\u201d and would \u201cno longer be available to Juicers for after hours charging.\u201d\n\nThe company said it also plans to staff its global charging facilities 24 hours a day with employees trained to handle \u201cthese particular batteries.\u201d", "\n\nEarly voters filled the polling place entrance Thursday as they waited to cast their ballots at St. Catherine Laboure Catholic Church in Wheaton, Md.

(Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nIn Maryland, where eight days of early voting ended Thursday night, elections officials say 16.7 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot early \u2014 up from 8.3 percent in 2014. In all, 661,276 votes were cast, compared with 307,646 early votes in 2014.\n\nVirginians cast 245,639 mailed or in-person absentee ballots as of Thursday afternoon \u2014 nearly double the 2014 total of 123,221, according to the most recent state statistics. In Fairfax County, the state\u2019s most populous jurisdiction, 61,880 absentee ballots had been cast as of Thursday, compared with a total of 28,662 in 2014, officials there said. Voters can continue to show up for in-person absentee-ballot voting until Saturday.\n\nThe District\u2019s totals also exceeded the city\u2019s 2014 numbers. As of Thursday afternoon, 32,000 people had cast early ballots at 14 locations in the nation\u2019s capital, up from a total of 26,660 four years earlier. Early voting ended Friday.\n\nBut reading too much into the numbers can throw expectations, analysts say, because early voting has been growing in popularity in recent years, and so much of what drives the early vote is its convenience. People who have voted early once tend to do it again, even as more people try it for the first time.\n\nIn past elections, higher early numbers have not necessarily meant higher overall turnout rates, and experts say they cannot determine whether a \u201cblue wave\u201d is coming or nothing more than a splash.\n\n\n\nElection workers assist early voters at the Frederick Senior Center in Frederick, Md., on Oct. 25.

On Friday, the Nigerian army took to Twitter to defend its decision to open fire at Shiite protesters in the capital, Abuja \u2014 by citing Trump.\n\n\u201cPlease Watch and Make your Deductions,\u201d read the tweet, which included a video clip in which Trump says: \u201cAnybody throwing stones, rocks . . . we will consider that a firearm because there is not much difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\u201d Trump said in his Nov. 1 remarks.\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted.\n\nIt was published the same week that Nigerian army troops opened fire on a march of protesters belonging to the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), who were demanding the release of their jailed leader, Ibrahim el-Zakzaky.

The U.S. president has never directly addressed Nigeria\u2019s sectarian tensions, but the case was yet another example of how Trump\u2019s domestic rhetoric has been used to justify violence abroad and has damaged the influence of U.S. diplomats who try to uphold official State Department policies.\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated attacks on the media have made it harder for diplomats abroad to defend press freedom. On trade, the president has weakened the standing of the World Trade Organization by ignoring its trade war warnings and confronting China. That decision could still have broader implications in the future by preventing other disputes from being solved, with Trump blamed for breaking the international consensus first. Trump\u2019s at times friendly treatment of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has also raised questions in other authoritarian nations about whether Trump values personal ties more than actual progress on improving human rights records, previously a cornerstone of U.S. diplomacy.\n\nOverall, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach has satisfied the needs of some rulers, but it has left the United States far more isolated than in previous decades. Diplomats working abroad complain that the United States may still be shaping global politics, but it\u2019s no longer controlling the message.\n\nFriday\u2019s now-deleted tweet by the Nigerian army is just the latest example of that.\n\nMax Bearak in Nairobi contributed to this report.

(Photo NASA via Getty Images)\n\nDuring America\u2019s invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003, Neil deGrasse Tyson faced a hard choice. Tyson \u2014 astrophysicist, sonorous TV host, poet laureate of the sky \u2014 was attending a symposium of the nonprofit Space Foundation, which promotes space exploration. The meeting brought together university scientists, experts on space war and representatives of the military industrial complex that supports them both.\n\nBetween sessions, conference-goers watched CNN coverage of American weaponry pounding targets in Iraq. \u201cEvery time a corporation was identified as the producer of a particular instrument of destruction, its employees and executives in the audience broke into applause,\u201d Tyson writes. He blinked back tears. He thought about walking out and resigning from the foundation\u2019s board. But then he decided instead to \u201cexplore other ways to reconcile my emotions.\u201d\n\nIn his book \u201cAccessory to War,\u201d Tyson pursues his reconciliation. Through ample research and nimble storytelling, Tyson and his co-author and longtime editor and researcher, Avis Lang, trace the long and tangled relationship between state power and astronomy. The narrative reveals key moments in the convergence of astronomy and war. In 1608, for example, Hans Lipperhey, a maker of spectacles, showed up at The Hague to present the world\u2019s first telescope to Prince Maurice of Nassau, just as the Dutch were negotiating with the Spanish to pause the Eighty Years War. Both sides recognized that the device could be used to spy on distant enemies, an advance that perhaps hastened Spain\u2019s decision to sign a truce.\n\nThe telescope then followed two paths, one that pointed to the heavens and the other to the battlefield. Galileo built a better version and found the moons of Jupiter and what would later be recognized as the rings of Saturn. Meanwhile, Spain and the Netherlands soon resumed fighting. In recognition of the new technology\u2019s capability in war, Spanish artist Diego Velazquez painted a scene featuring the victorious commander Ambrogio Spinola holding \u201ca spyglass nearly two feet long near the focal point of the painting, as if to emphasize its role in the victory,\u201d Tyson and Lang write.\n\nThe mixing of astronomy and the military comes into sharp focus in the second half of the 20th century. The authors recount how military satellites meant to sniff out thermonuclear tests discovered gamma-ray bursts, brief flashes from energetic stellar explosions in the far reaches of space. The Air Force funded surveys of the entire sky in infrared light. Studies of the nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll helped astrophysicists learn that the chemical elements that make up human bodies and everything else were forged during the life cycles of stars.\n\nIn funding and projects, the astronomical sciences are the poor stepchild of the military. Consider the Hubble Space Telescope. This low Earth orbit instrument was seen as a unique mission famous for its vivid imagery and scientific contributions. In fact, Hubble wasn\u2019t so unique. Around the same time that NASA launched Hubble in 1990 to investigate cosmic mysteries, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office\u2019s Keyhole program was already managing 20 similar yet bigger spy satellites. NASA scientists grasped this fact only years later, once the satellites were declassified. If Hubble scientists thought they were leading the way, they were mistaken. \u201cHubble was a KEYHOLE-class satellite, not the other way around,\u201d Tyson and Lang write. The gulf in resources between science and military projects became even more apparent in 2011, when the same military office regifted two spare, better-than-Hubble mirrors to NASA. And today NASA still lacks the money to launch them.\n\nTyson and Lang also recount the peaceful and not-so-peaceful exploration of space. They trace the U.S.-Soviet Cold War competition and the United Nations\u2019 efforts to establish international space law, including the 1967 Outer Space Treaty governing states\u2019 activities in the cosmos. The authors outline the kinds of space militarization long underway with an emphasis on surveillance and communications disruptions rather than on lasers and explosives. They assess the current astro-strategic balance of power and show the United States clinging to an outdated idea of dominance and China appearing ascendant.\n\nGiven President Trump\u2019s recent proposal for a U.S. Space Force to bundle existing space-security efforts into a new military branch, this discussion seems especially timely. Readers hungry for an engaging, well-researched primer on space military policy and its history will be edified. Readers who prefer astronomy and want to learn about satellites that look up into space rather than those that look down at rival nations might find these sections less compelling.\n\nBut getting astronomy-lovers to sit with this material, of course, might be the point of the book, and in the final chapter Tyson and Lang attempt to resolve the military-science tension with brief sketches of a possible happier future. Since asteroids have plenty of metals and comets plenty of water, eventual space mining technologies might end the kind of scarcity that sometimes drives war, they argue. And astrophysics itself \u2014 by encouraging us to contemplate the cosmic sublime \u2014 might \u201credirect our species\u2019 urges to kill into collaborative urges to explore,\u201d they write.\n\nOnly a few quibbles: When the book veers into space policy, it becomes less focused. Although Tyson and Lang repeatedly argue for a two-way street between war and astronomy, the contemporary cases they present seem to show otherwise \u2014 that astronomy isn\u2019t so much an accessory to war as a collector of military scraps.\n\nTyson and Lang do not settle the moral anguish that troubled Tyson when the bombs were falling on Iraq. How does he feel now? That moment haunts the book, just as its narrative is likely to haunt astronomers crushed between their field\u2019s wide-eyed hopefulness and its deep indebtedness to national security fears. Still, kudos to Tyson and Lang for pointing out the quandary, taking a deep and eloquent look at it, and offering a way forward.", "", "\n\nDeSean Jackson (11) asked for a trade this week, but with Tampa Bay reinstalling Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback, perhaps Jackson will shine again. (Frank Victores/Associated Press)\n\nNeed some quick tips to assemble your fantasy lineup for Week 9? With six teams on their bye week, we\u2019ve combed the far reaches of the Internet and culled only the choicest fantasy tips and advice for your consumption. Below you\u2019ll find easily digestible nuggets from multiple fantasy experts, addressing some of the critical situations fantasy owners will face from week to week.\n\nDig in. And dominate.\n\nInjury Decisions\n\nDalvin Cook, RB, Vikings: Cook says he feels great, but whether that translates into playing time in Week 9 is a whole other story. Cook has participated in back-to-back limited practice sessions, but his owners have been filling in for him for weeks. It probably would be best to see Cook in a game before putting him back in lineups. Update: It sounds like Cook will see action, but will be on a snap count.\n\n[The fantasy football players you need in your lineup for Week 9]\n\nKeke Coutee, WR, Texans: Coutee is seemingly in great shape to pick up more targets on the heels of Houston losing Will Fuller for the season, but Coutee remains limited with a hamstring injury. If Coutee is in better shape following Friday\u2019s practice, then he could be in line for a nice game. Otherwise, newcomer Demaryius Thomas could benefit in Week 9. Update: Coutee continues to be limited but still sounds like he\u2019s going to be active this weekend.\n\nMelvin Gordon, RB, Chargers: Gordon was scratched in Week 7 because of a hamstring injury. San Diego had its bye in Week 8, giving Gordon time to heal. He has practiced for two consecutive days and all signs point to him being back in the mix when the Chargers face the Seahawks this weekend. Update: While Gordon is listed as questionable, he was a full participant in Friday\u2019s practice.\n\nTyreek Hill, WR, Chiefs: Much has been made about Hill\u2019s groin injury, but while he went through a limited practice on Thursday, we probably need to see how Friday\u2019s injury report shakes out before making any rash lineup decisions. Hill would certainly have a chance to shine when Kansas City plays Cleveland on Sunday. Update: Good news as Hill was not listed on the team\u2019s injury report Friday.\n\nCooper Kupp, WR, Rams: Settle down Josh Reynolds fans ... Mr. Kupp is not listed on the team\u2019s injury report.\n\nSony Michel, RB, Patriots: Just when it looked like Michel was hitting his stride and paying off for his patient owners, the injury bug struck again. Michel continues to be hampered by a knee injury and was limited in Thursday\u2019s practice. New England plays on Sunday night, which could make things a bit more hairy for Michel owners with a decision to make. Monitor his situation, but have an alternative just in case. Update: Michel says he feels pretty good following Friday\u2019s practice, though it\u2019s unknown if Michel was a full participant.\n\n[Fantasy Football start/sit tips Week 9: Adrian Peterson won\u2019t slow down against the Falcons]\n\nFringe Starters\n\nAmari Cooper, WR, Cowboys: Cooper has had ample time to get comfortable with his new team, given that Dallas had a bye week following the trade for the former Raiders wideout. Will a new location be just what the doctor ordered for Cooper? It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of fantasy pundits are weighing in this week, perhaps wanting to see how the Cowboys get Cooper involved. But their Week 9 opponent, the Tennessee Titans, have been solid on defense but have been vulnerable against No. 1 wide receivers. And we can probably count on Dallas trying to get Cooper involved early and often, given Jerry Jones did cough up a first-round pick. There\u2019s obviously some risk, but Cooper owners probably have no choice but take the glass-is-half-full approach in Week 9.\n\nDeSean Jackson, WR, Buccaneers: With his targets and production down in recent weeks, Jackson demanded a trade. Tampa Bay then decided to make Ryan Fitzpatrick the starting quarterback in Week 9 when the Bucs hit the road to face the Panthers. While still solid, Carolina\u2019s defense isn\u2019t quite what it used to be. In other words, it would make perfect sense for Jackson to demand a trade, then go out on Sunday and hook up with Fitzpatrick for a big game. With six teams on a bye, Jackson certainly offers an option for owners in need and may be worth a roll of the dice.\n\nDemaryius Thomas, WR, Texans: It\u2019s rare we would feature the same player in back-to-back weeks in the Fringe Starters portion of our cheat sheet, but with Thomas switching teams this week, there\u2019s no time like the present to evaluate what\u2019s in store for the newest member of Houston\u2019s locker room. Thomas owners might want to proceed cautiously since he has had little time to become immersed in the Texans' playbook. Or his owners could go all-in that Thomas will fill the void left by the injury to Fuller. And to make it even better, Thomas is playing against his former team -- the Denver Broncos. Phew! It\u2019s a tough call because I love to go with players who have a chip on their shoulder, and every player dealt away from a ballclub loves to play well when facing their former teams. Some Thomas owners may not have much choice but to roll the dice, but there is some risk.\n\n[Week 9 fantasy football player rankings]\n\nSammy Watkins, WR, Chiefs: Watkins is coming off his best game of the season (107 yards and two touchdowns) and now Kansas City meets the Browns in Week 9. For Watkins owners, it could pay off handsomely, but would it be a shock if the Chiefs jump out early and Watkins is barely heard from? I think we call can agree that this result would not come as a surprise. With reports swirling about Tyreek Hill dealing with a groin issue, Watkins' owners were eyeing a weekend with an increase in targets, but Hill practiced in full Wednesday. Watkins might be worth the risk for owners dealing with bye weeks and depth issues.\n\nLottery Tickets That Could Pay Off\n\nDavid Moore, WR, Seahawks: Moore has been lurking near the line of fantasy relevance for a couple weeks. While he hasn\u2019t been getting more than three to four targets, and he only eclipsed the 50-yard mark for the first time in Week 8, he is certainly making the most of those targets with Seattle. In a Week 5 loss to the Rams, Moore had three receptions for 38 yards, but two of his grabs went for touchdowns. A week later, he had two catches for 47 yards ... and another TD. Following the team\u2019s bye week, Moore hauled in all four of his targets in Week 8, totaling 97 yards and adding another score. The Seahawks are home for Week 9 against a solid defensive unit in the Chargers, but Doug Baldwin and Tyler Lockett figure to command San Diego\u2019s attention. That could leave Moore in position to have another productive effort. Moore was barely owned last week, but even with a boost, he remains available in 86 percent of ESPN leagues. Even if you aren\u2019t going to play Moore, he could come in handy at a later point.\n\nCourtland Sutton, WR, Broncos: While Sutton\u2019s stock has climbed considerably since the trade of Thomas, he remains available in 45 percent of ESPN leagues so we\u2019ll keep him parked here in the lottery section though it should be a short-lived stay. That\u2019s because Sutton has been creeping into the picture in Denver\u2019s passing game. In his past four games, he\u2019s caught two touchdowns and he has two games with respectable yardage (58 and 78 yards). The Broncos host the Texans, who have been vulnerable at times in the secondary. With six teams on a bye week, Sutton could very well be needed ... and he certainly has a lot of upside heading down the stretch.\n\n***This post is updated each Friday afternoon with additional information on injuries and other player-related news.", "When big news breaks, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in following the story online. But while the Internet \u2014 including major news sites and social media, such as Twitter \u2014 can be a place to find useful information, it also can be the source of misinformation. Helping kids and teens understand the news and how to separate fact from fiction is an important job for parents and educators.\n\nHere\u2019s some advice that parents can offer kids and teens to help them be more discerning readers as they consume news online.\n\nRemember, breaking news is often wrong. In the rush to cover stories, reporters make mistakes, officials don\u2019t always have correct information and tidbits that sound plausible often get passed around before anyone has checked them for accuracy. The most famous example is when the Chicago Daily Tribune, reporting on the presidential election, printed \u201cDewey Defeats Truman\u201d on its front page in 1948 when the truth was actually the opposite.\n\nUse social media wisely. Some say Twitter is a great source of news in the first few minutes of a tragedy, but after that it just becomes messy and largely inaccurate. On the other hand, Facebook can be a great way to connect with friends affected by events in the news and to spread personal news within a more limited circle. For example: \u201cI\u2019ve heard from family in Florida, and everyone\u2019s okay after the hurricane.\u201d (Of course, news links posted by friends on Facebook might contain unverified information, so take them with a grain of salt.)\n\nBe skeptical. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. After the Boston Marathon bombing, NBC Sports reported that some runners kept running all the way to the hospital to donate blood for the victims. Not true. There are plenty of websites devoted to debunking fake news stories, sites such as Snopes, Urban Legends Online and FactCheck. The Washington Post also has a Fact Checker column that addresses claims made by public officials and politicians. Visit them to find out if a story is true.\n\nStand back; take a break. With social media at your fingertips, it\u2019s tempting to weigh in with your opinion or share every update that comes along. But restraint is necessary to avoid adding to the noise and confusion. We like the reasonable approach taken by NPR reporter Steve Inskeep, who cautioned listeners during a day of breaking news, \u201cWe are collecting dots. It\u2019s a day to be careful about connecting them.\"\n\nStick with credible news sources. News sources that claim to have all the answers or jump to conclusions about why something happened are just adding to the fray. And remember that cable news channels make money off the news \u2014 the more titillating the story, the more eyeballs that watch, and the more money they make. Make sure you and your kids aren\u2019t falling victim to fake news.\n\nKeep it age-appropriate. Younger teens and kids aren\u2019t always ready to digest big, tragic news \u2014 especially if the news is about kids, such as school shootings or abuse scandals. The constant repetition of information can be overwhelming and confusing for younger kids, and at the beginning of a news event, parents might not be able to offer any reassuring answers. Kids who are eager to learn more about certain events can check kid-oriented news sources.\n\nSierra Filucci is a journalist who writes for Common Sense Media.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nShe\u2019s not going to run for president, she says, but maybe she should run a presidential campaign. I\u2019ve pointed out that Democrats need uplift, poetry and aspiration. Boy does Oprah Winfrey get it. Thursday, at a rally for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Winfrey was on fire:\n\n\"Let me just talk to the women for a minute,\" Oprah Winfrey says while campaigning for Stacey Abrams, telling listeners to \"stand united and vote our values. Vote your values. Vote you conscience.\" https://t.co/uhXHjlRQUw pic.twitter.com/YPbn7M4P5j \u2014 CNN (@CNN) November 1, 2018\n\n\u201cVote your values,\u201d should be Democrats\u2019 mantra. Republicans used to claim the \u201cfamily values\u201d issue. Democrats were ruining the culture with crassness, vulgarity and violence in entertainment, the not-very-moral majority finger-waggers said.\n\nIn the closing days of the midterm campaign, President Trump has made clear precisely what the GOP stands for these days. He and his party wear their irrationality, racism and cruelty on their sleeves. They bear hug dictators around the world, no matter what deeds those leaders commit (killing and dismembering a journalist) or how explicit is their neo-fascism (as in Brazil, which national security adviser John Bolton candidly acknowledged his boss considers a \u201clike-minded\u201d regime).\n\nThe midterms have moved from an election about issues \u2014 health care, the tax cuts, debt \u2014 to what we can appropriately, for once, say is about the soul of the country. In the final days of the campaign, Trump (on the caravan) and Republicans (on protecting preexisting conditions) have simply lied. The caravan is not a threat, is no where near the border and does not contain Middle Eastern terrorists. Republicans repeatedly voted to repeal Obamacare, including its protection for preexisting conditions, with no reasonable substitute; they currently are pursuing litigation that would invalidate Obamacare\u2019s protection for preexisting conditions. These pronouncements are not spin or exaggeration; they are lies. The voters should decide if our politics now refuses to distinguish fact from fiction, truth from falsehood.\n\nIn continuing to deploy the Stalinist phrase \u201cenemy of the people\u201d \u2014 even after bombs were sent to CNN \u2014 and stoke fears of immigrants, the GOP sounds more like the far-right politicians in Poland, Hungary and now Brazil than Americans. Once more, voters have to decide if that dark, illiberal politics has a place in America.\n\nThere are fundamental rights \u2014 birthright citizenship, the right to vote, the First Amendment \u2014 that the GOP has sought to undermine for political gain. For a time, I feared this might work. However, there are reassuring signs that Trump\u2019s nativism, racism and protectionism don\u2019t play well with those not inclined to hoot and holler at his rallies. The New York Times reports:\n\nIn Republican-leaning districts that include diverse populations or abut cities that do \u2014 from bulwarks of Sunbelt conservatism like Houston and Orange County, Calif., to the well-manicured bedroom communities outside Philadelphia and Minneapolis \u2014 the party is in danger of losing its House majority next week because Mr. Trump\u2019s racially-tinged nationalism has alienated these voters who once made up a dependable constituency. . . . College-educated white women now say they prefer Democrats to control Congress by 18 points, according to a survey by Marist College and NPR. In moderate areas, the Republican coalition has long depended on upscale whites casting aside their more liberal views on issues like gun control and abortion to support G.O.P. economic policies. Mr. Trump\u2019s national message does virtually nothing to accommodate those voters.\n\nThe midterm elections have therefore become all about Trump, about whether he\u2019s \u201cwinning\u201d or \u201cpaying a price\u201d for his descent into rancor, racism and misogyny. Suddenly the real \u201cvalues voters\u201d are those who care deeply about values such as kindness, democracy, rationality and respect. If they show up and vote their values, Republicans are in big trouble.\n\nRelated:", "", "", "", "bad url", "\n\nThe scallops with black garlic, sweet potato, celery and trevisano at American Son, the flagship restaurant at the new Eaton hotel in downtown Washington.

(AP Photo/Leo Correa)\n\nOn Sunday, Brazilians elected a far-right populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose charismatic campaign has dramatically reshaped the country\u2019s political landscape. Ever linguistically playful, Brazilians invented a series of nicknames: On the right, \u201cBolsominions\u201d (the president\u2019s most fervent followers) sold T-shirts lauding their guy as \u201cO Mito,\u201d or \u201cThe Myth.\u201d On the left, supporters of candidate Fernando Haddad adopted the hashtag \u201c#Bolsoasno\u201d (Bolso-donkey).\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s supporters seemed to revel in his inflammatory rhetoric and disparaging comments toward women and minorities, in the mythos of his surviving an ill-conceived September assassination attempt, and in his messianic campaign promises.\n\nWhat does Bolsonaro\u2019s victory signal?\n\nThe rise of a candidate like Bolsonaro is surprising in a country that has long ranked near the top of the region on indicators of political tolerance.

Will Brazilians adopt the harsher tone of their new leader when addressing political opponents, women, racial minorities and the LGBT community?\n\nTolerance was already under fire\n\nBrazil\u2019s democratic and tolerant political culture had started to erode long before any political buzz about Bolsonaro\u2019s potential candidacy. When this year\u2019s campaign officially began in July, Brazilians had seen five years of stagnant or even negative economic growth, massive corruption investigations, divisive presidential elections, dueling protests and the impeachment of a sitting president. The 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, brief interludes, were largely forgotten \u2014 though the large public works associated with these events may have abetted corruption.\n\nSupport for democracy has been on a downward trend in Brazil at least since 2010. Qualitative interviews we conducted in September 2017 make it clear that many Brazilians had reached a point of despair about their political system. As one interviewee remarked: \u201cIt is sort of a complicated business, I think \u2026 to not have hope.\u2026 I never ever thought about leaving Brazil, but if I did not have family here, I would have already gone.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s campaign profited from this skepticism\n\nBolsonaro did not create this crisis of democratic confidence. Rather, his campaign exploited it by portraying the candidate as a law-and-order outsider who could restore discipline.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s campaign also weaponized old social biases and divisions. Our prior work shows that, despite popular myths affirming Brazil as a \u201cracial democracy,\u201d racial and gender discrimination are common. Despite large reservoirs of tolerance, Brazil has historically had high rates of anti-LGBT hate crimes. And even prior to the campaign, most Brazilians endorsed negative stereotypes of impoverished families participating in the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia social safety net program, which had become less popular amid the economic crisis.\n\nSo now what happens to the political culture of democracy in Brazil?\n\nThe supporters of the \u201cMyth\u201d who took to the streets to celebrate last Sunday will be looking for quick results. Yet Bolsonaro\u2019s administration will face numerous policy and governability challenges, including crime, corruption, health care, taxes and pension reform. It is unclear whether this self-admittedly \u201cuntrained\u201d leader will be able to maneuver the complex politics of building legislative coalitions in a Congress with 30 distinct political parties.\n\n[Is Brazil\u2019s presidential front-runner Jair Bolsonaro the Latin American Donald Trump? Nope.]\n\nDisappointment with Bolsonaro could exacerbate democratic cynicism among his supporters \u2014 many of whom already exhibit weaker attachment to democratic norms than their fellow citizens, according to our research.\n\nThe opposite scenario, however, may present the greater danger. Bolsonaro\u2019s followers may defend their leader zealously \u2014 even helping him limit others\u2019 civil rights. Prior to the election, electoral authorities authorized police to enter public universities and classrooms to remove pro-democracy and anti-fascist documents, computer drives and banners. These actions were ostensibly aimed to prevent illegal campaign advertising, under the dubious and worrisome argument that pro-democracy speech constituted criticism of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s candidacy. After the election, one newly elected legislator has set up a WhatsApp hotline for students to submit complaints regarding and recordings of anti-Bolsonaro speech by their professors.\n\nIt may be a hard time for female, minority and LGBT Brazilians\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s leadership is likely also to contribute to growing intolerance of women, racial minorities and the LGBT community. Brazilians have historically voiced strong support for the norm of equality. Yet political science research finds that, over time, voters tend to adopt the views of their chosen \u201cteam.\u201d A moderate who affiliates with an extremist candidate for unrelated reasons can be gradually radicalized. And in times of perceived crisis and threat, voters are more vulnerable to authoritarian appeals.\n\nStill, it is important to remember that only a plurality of the Brazilian electorate voted for Bolsonaro this past Sunday. Nearly 30 percent of registered voters abstained or cast null/blank ballots in the second round, despite the country\u2019s compulsory voting rules.\n\n[Brazil\u2019s most popular politician, Lula, won\u2019t be on the October presidential ballot. Here\u2019s what comes next.]\n\nSupporters of Bolsonaro\u2019s leftist opponent Haddad now face the uncertainty of offering political resistance to the resurgent right while rebuilding an electorally competitive coalition. On Tuesday, they took to the streets in S\u00e3o Paulo, voicing anxiety over Bolsonaro\u2019s radical anti-democratic rhetoric. These demonstrations may presage more turmoil ahead, particularly if pro-Bolsonaro security forces seek to repress future activism.\n\nThe good news is that the losing side \u2014 perhaps still harboring the historical memory of Brazil\u2019s brutal 1964-to-1985 military regime \u2014 seems committed to democratic procedures. As a consequence, it appears that Brazil will experience yet another peaceful transfer of executive power \u2014 the eighth since the end of the military regime in 1985. Barring another surprise in Brazilian politics, the opposition will have to wait four more years for the chance to replace the president.\n\nMatthew Layton is assistant professor of political science at Ohio University.\n\nAmy Erica Smith is associate professor of political science at Iowa State University and is author of Religion and Brazilian Democracy: Mobilizing the People of God (2019, Cambridge University Press).", "A man picks his way through the debris of a destroyed building in Sanaa, Yemen, on Nov. 1, 2018.

The rebels were using the air base to launch attacks on the kingdom with drones and missiles, the spokesman, Col. Turki al-Maliki, told al-Ekhbariya TV, a Saudi state-owned broadcaster.\n\nThe Houthis, through their own television station, confirmed that more than 30 airstrikes had targeted the air base and other areas around the capital.\n\nMeanwhile, the Saudi-led coalition appeared to have launched a fresh offensive against the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeida, according to Yemeni government sources and local media. Fighting was reported early Friday in southern and eastern areas of the city.\n\nThe port is a vital gateway for the imports of food, medicines and other essential supplies, as well as much of the humanitarian aid heading to northern Yemen. The assault followed reports this week of the coalition\u2019s sending more than 10,000 reinforcements toward Hodeida via a southwestern coastal route.\n\n\u201cFierce battles between forces backed by Saudi-led coalition and the #Houthis have been going on for hours in the southern and eastern outlets of the Red Sea port city of #Hodiedah, with huge blasts being heard and airstrikes,\u201d Yemeni journalist Mohammed al-Qadhi wrote in a tweet Friday morning.\n\nFriday\u2019s assault comes two days after the United States called for a cease-fire and negotiations within 30 days to end the war. The fresh offensive could be designed to pressure the Houthis to come to the negotiating table, which the rebels have so far avoided.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are part of a regional coalition that is seeking to oust the Houthis and restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government. But the Houthis, who control the capital and much of northern Yemen, have so far showed few signs of weakening in the three-year-long conflict that has become a military stalemate.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim nations is also wary of the spreading influence in the region of Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy, widely said to be backing the Houthis. The United States, meanwhile, is supporting the coalition by refueling its jets, providing intelligence and selling its members arms worth billions of dollars.\n\nTrapped between the warring parties are millions of Yemenis grappling with what the United Nations describes as the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian crisis.

(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nThey were sprinting from the Mexican border straight into oncoming traffic on Interstate 5 in California, zigzagging their way around cars approaching the San Diego port of entry.\n\n\u201cThey keep coming,\u201d the narrator said over ominous music. \u201cTwo million illegal immigrants in California.\u201d\n\nThe footage was from \u201cBorder Under Siege,\u201d a 1992 PR film produced by the U.S. Border Patrol. But on the TV screens of millions of Californians, it was a 1994 reelection campaign ad for Gov. Pete Wilson, who had just sued the federal government for failing to stop an \u201cinvasion\u201d of undocumented immigrants under the Constitution\u2019s Invasion Clause: Article IV Section 4, which requires the federal government to protect the states against invasion. Wilson was running one of the most anti-immigrant campaigns of his era, seeking to strip all social services from undocumented immigrants under his Proposition 187.\n\nBut his militaristic \u201cinvasion\u201d metaphor, fueling beliefs that California was literally \u201cunder siege,\" was an old usage.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the oldest and most persistent anti-immigration metaphors in the country\u2019s history, employed to oppose Irish Catholics, Asians, Latinos, Germans, Jews and just about everyone except white Protestants of English ancestry who now lives in America. The nation has been perpetually facing a supposed \u201cinvasion\u201d from many stripes of immigrants, said Leo R. Chavez, a social sciences professor at the University of California, Irvine and author of \u201cThe Latino Threat: Constructing Immigrants, Citizens, and the Nation.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s recent use of the \u201cinvasion\u201d metaphor to describe the caravan of thousands of asylum-seeking Central Americans now approaching the southern border is only the latest iteration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an invasion,\u201d he said during his remarks about the caravan Thursday. \u201cThey have violently overrun the Mexican border. You saw that two days ago. These are tough people, in many cases. A lot of young men, strong men. And a lot of men that maybe we don\u2019t want in our country.\u201d\n\nThe rhetorical tool, Chavez said, \u201cerases the real characteristics of those who wish to come to the United States,\u201d instead creating the image of a single army \u201cbent on destroying our way of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have to realize that Trump didn\u2019t invent this rhetoric,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cHe\u2019s just able to use it effectively.\u201d\n\nThe strategy of framing immigration as an invasion can be traced back to the antebellum era in the 1850s, when the Protestant-majority Know Nothing party, the original \u201cAmerica First\u201d party, rallied against Catholic immigrants. Believing they were controlled by the Pope and therefore incompatible with American liberties, the Know Nothings charged that Catholic immigrants \u201cmarch and countermarch with the precision of regular soldiers, at the tap of the Popish drum.\u201d\n\nNext, it was the Asians. In an 1889 court decision involving the Chinese Exclusion Act, Supreme Court Chief Justice Stephen J. Field summed up California politicians' attitudes toward Chinese laborers this way: \u201cTheir immigration was in numbers approaching the character of an Oriental invasion, and was a menace to our civilization; the discontent from this cause was not confined to any political party, or to any class or nationality, but was well-nigh universal.\u201d\n\nFear of immigrants was not confined to uneducated working class Americans. \u201cThe Immigration Restriction League, founded by young Harvard-educated Boston Brahmins in 1894,\u201d wrote Charles Hirschman in a 2006 study, \u201cadvocated a literacy test to slow the tide of immigration. It was thought,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat a literacy test would reduce immigration from southern and eastern Europe, which was sending an 'alarming number of illiterates, paupers, criminals, and madmen who endangered American character and citizenship.\u201d\n\nBut for Latino immigrants, such negative attitudes toward their migration didn\u2019t proliferate until the early 1970s, when illegal immigration at the southern border first started rising, as demographers Douglas S. Massey and Karen A. Pren of Princeton University\u2019s Mexican Migration Project found in a 2012 paper examining immigrant metaphors.\n\nOfficials under the administration of President Gerald Ford were particularly fond of warning of an \u201cillegal alien invasion,\" as though America were bracing for a sequel of H.G. Wells\u2019s \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201d\n\nLeonard Chapman, then-commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, wrote an article in Reader\u2019s Digest in 1976 describing a looming national crisis, titled, \u201cIllegal Aliens: Time to Call a Halt!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I became commissioner in 1973, we were out-manned, under-budgeted, and confronted by a growing, silent invasion of illegal aliens. Despite our best efforts, the problem \u2014 critical then \u2014 now threatens to become a national disaster,\u201d Chapman wrote.\n\nThen-CIA Director William Colby believed the situation was so pressing that if Mexican immigrants weren\u2019t stopped, they would create a \u201cSpanish-speaking Quebec\u201d in the southwestern United States, according to the book \u201cOperation Gatekeeper: The Rise of the \u2018Illegal Alien\u2019 and the Making of the U.S.-Mexico Boundary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most obvious threat,\u201d Colby said, \u201cis the fact that...there are going to be 120 million Mexicans by the end of the century. . . . [The Border Patrol] will not have enough bullets to stop them.\u201d\n\nChavez, the UC Irvine professor, said these fears of Mexican immigration, and of nonwhite immigration generally, spread as a result of evolving demographics after changes in immigration law in the mid-1960s. America\u2019s immigration policies in the coming years \u2014 and politicians' border rhetoric \u2014 was a response to what became known as \u201cthe browning of America,\" he said.\n\nCongress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965, which replaced what was seen as a racist quota system that, for decades, restricted immigration of Africans, Asians and Eastern Europeans with a system that more equally distributed yearly visas to countries worldwide. But it was the first time countries in the Western Hemisphere and Latin America were subject to any immigration quota. And around the same time, Congress canceled the Bracero program, which allowed temporary migrant workers to come and go across the border for farm labor, making about 450,000 fewer legal visas available to Mexicans per year.\n\nThe result, Chavez said, was that while the same number of people from Latin America wanted to come over for work, the vast majority suddenly lacked a readily available legal option. The annual total of people who illegally crossed the border from Mexico increased from fewer than 25,000 in 1958 to more than 450,000 by 1978, according to data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nChavez said Trump\u2019s rhetoric does not match reality. Trump has often described a crisis at the border, necessitating a wall and troops. But data from the Department of Homeland Security show illegal crossings to be at historic lows, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBut the caravan presents a different challenge. Trump has said he may deploy as many as 15,000 members of the military to the border to meet more than 5,000 men, women and children who have been traveling for 21 days from Central America. The president said he plans to take executive action next week seeking to stop \u201cabuse\u201d of the asylum system and to limit the migrants' entry, vowing that they will be confined to \u201cmassive tent cities.\" But he offered few details.\n\nAsked Thursday by reporters if his planned response to the caravan is legal, Trump said, \u201cOh, this is totally legal. No. This is legal. We are stopping people at the border. This is an invasion, and nobody is even questioning that.\u201d", "\n\nThe Wizards' new Geico-sponsored jerseys.

She\u2019d also be the first governor who writes romantic suspense novels \u2014 eight of them, in fact, published under the pseudonym Selena Montgomery. It is tempting to dismiss these fictions as a frivolous dalliance, but Abrams connects her literary work to her politics. As she told Entertainment Weekly in September, \u201cMy principles flow through and are evident in everything I write.\u201d\n\nIt may not come as a surprise that her romance novels are imbued with a strong sense of social justice. But Abrams is hardly the only writer \u2014 or reader \u2014 to identify a radical undercurrent in this frequently derided genre. Although it has an understandable reputation for affirming patriarchal norms, romance fiction has long enabled women to rethink the world in their own terms, imagining communities dedicated to their own happiness. Romance novels are often places where women can realize their sexual desires and envision more utopian ways of being.\n\nAbrams, accordingly, links the work of social justice to the experience of falling in love. The plots of her books frequently echo the key pillars of her campaign platform \u2014 especially health care, criminal justice reform, child care and the environment. In \u201cSecrets and Lies,\u201d a professional thief and an ethnobotanist thwart big pharma by returning a valuable drug to indigenous peoples in South America. \u201cReckless\u201d finds a defense lawyer and a sheriff teaming up to exonerate the black owner of an orphanage from a false accusation of murder. And in \u201cDeception,\u201d an FBI agent and a professional poker player prevent a nature preserve from being converted into biofuels.\n\nThese aren\u2019t exactly the sort of plotlines the genre is known for. Feminist critics like Germaine Greer, Ann Douglas and Lauren Berlant have derided romances for their bad politics, not just for their often-mediocre writing and supposed reliance on turgid formulas. That\u2019s not entirely unwarranted: \u201cBodice rippers\u201d from the 1970s, for example, almost inevitably featured eroticized rape scenes.\n\n[No, my book is not a \u2018guilty pleasure\u2019 just because I\u2019m a woman]\n\nBut then things began to change (though not everyone agreed that it was for the better). After 1980, a new set of college-educated and avowedly feminist editors, writers and readers recast the genre in a more progressive mold. These new romances typically depicted consensual sex, often featured career women and rarely revolved around the loss of the heroine\u2019s virginity. Despite that, critics like Tania Modleski allege that these novels still hold that a woman\u2019s fulfillment comes in her choice of a man; even romance\u2019s staunchest defenders \u2014 such as scholar Cailey Hall or bloggers Sarah Wendell and Candy Tan \u2014 acknowledge that the books most often depict monogamous sexual relationships between white, heterosexual couples as the normative, universal manifestation of love. These debates were reignited with the release of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d which Katie Roiphe interpreted as testifying to a woman\u2019s \u201cfantasy of being dominated or overcome by a man.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1980s, still the heyday of the bodice ripper, literary critic Janice Radway set out to prove the haters wrong. In her classic 1984 study, \u201cReading the Romance,\u201d for which she interviewed fans of the genre, she concluded that the novels\u2019 plots often allowed women to work through feelings of oppression and unhappiness. But these books also offered an alternative to their plight, holding out \u201cthe promise of utopian bliss.\u201d\n\nLiterary critics today continue to demonstrate that Abrams\u2019s novels are not at all anomalous; romances, new and old, are often politically subversive. Pamela Regis posits that romances are the stories of heroines overcoming obstacles and that women read them \u201cbecause they are in love with freedom.\u201d Writing recently in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Cat Sebastian argues that romance\u2019s insistence \u201con joy and love . . . is nothing less than radical,\u201d while Hall writes that romance exhibits a commitment to \u201cfemale happiness and fulfillment still lacking in most canonical works of literature.\u201d And while romance is still overwhelmingly white and heterosexual, with only 6.2 percent of the genre\u2019s novels in 2017 penned by writers of color, recent authors like Abrams represent an important contribution to making the genre more diverse.\n\n[I read books by only minority authors for a year. It showed me just how white our reading world is.]\n\nWe can see romance\u2019s vision of female solidarity particularly well in Abrams\u2019s novel \u201cNever Tell,\u201d which ostensibly details the pursuit of a deranged serial killer with a penchant for word games. But \u201cNever Tell\u201d is also the story of the protagonist, Erin, a woman of color recovering from physical and emotional abuse at the hands of a professor who exploited her naivete. In one scene, Erin and her love interest encounter Lindy, a woman with \u201cugly bruises [that] marred caf\u00e9 au lait skin.\u201d Explaining that her husband beat her after she got a job, Lindy insists, \u201cI don\u2019t deserve no better.\u201d Erin responds: \u201cNo one owns you. You are nobody\u2019s property.\u201d This encounter echoes an earlier one in which Erin imagines herself as her abuser\u2019s property \u2014 his \u201cthoughts were hers; his desires all that mattered.\u201d Abrams portrays both women of color, victims of domestic violence, as sharing a struggle and supporting one another.\n\nBy showing how Erin\u2019s experiences extend beyond her own life, Abrams invites the reader to participate in an imagined community dedicated to self-ownership and mutual support. \u201cWe have to see the good that others see in us,\u201d Erin tells Lindy. Abrams wants this for her readers as much as for her characters. Her fiction, which aims to make her readers identify with characters experiencing their self-worth, potentially empowers women, while also encouraging them to see the good in one another.\n\nIf Abrams\u2019s stories of flushing faces and soft whispers initially seem dreamy-eyed and disconnected from her politics, this is largely because we treat women\u2019s fiction as if it weren\u2019t serious literature. Abrams doesn\u2019t see it this way. \u201cI revel,\u201d she says, \u201cin having been . . . part of a genre that is read by millions and millions of women.\u201d She acknowledges that her political candidacy, too, is propelled by \u201cthe African American women\u2019s community.\u201d And yes, her novels, like most romances, end with a woman finding her man.

(Ricardo Moraes/pool via AP)\n\nDemocracy, as we\u2019ve found out the past few years, can be a fragile thing.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that reactionaries have started seizing power from popularly elected governments in coups or revolutions. The truth is both less dramatic and more insidious than that. No, it\u2019s that reactionaries have started winning power themselves as the leaders of popularly elected governments. Democracies, in other words, are electing people who aren\u2019t really democrats. At least not in the small-D sense of the word by respecting things such as a free press, an independent judiciary and minority rights.\n\nAnd sometimes all it takes is an ill-timed recession or corruption scandal for this to happen. Just ask Brazil, which is still reeling from both and, as a result, elected the once-fringe, far-right figure Jair Bolsanaro as its next president.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a pretty simple story. Brazil\u2019s economy has been going through a fairly standard emerging-markets crisis. It started in the early 2000s when the global commodity boom sent Brazil\u2019s growth up so much that households began borrowing a lot more, and foreign money came pouring in to try to get a piece of the pie. This was good while it lasted, but the problem is that it didn\u2019t last.\n\n[Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro tells Israeli newspaper he plans to move embassy to Jerusalem]\n\nBy 2014, all this had gone into reverse: Commodities had collapsed, consumers had slowed down their borrowing, and, in part because of the end of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing program, money that had gone to Brazil in search of higher returns now returned to the United States.\n\nThe good news, insofar as there was any, was that Brazil\u2019s central bank raised interest rates enough to keep its currency from falling too far \u2014 and its dollar debts from getting too hard to pay back \u2014 while its government built up enough of a rainy-day fund to cover all that. It did what was necessary to avoid the kind of vicious circle that Turkey is flirting with now, where a weaker currency increases your debt burdens and increased debt burdens weaken your currency even more.\n\nThis came at a cost, though. It always does. Higher interest rates hit Brazil when its economy was already faltering because of the effects of lower commodity prices and sent it into a deep recession. In fact, it was the worst one on record, going all the way back to the 1930s. Brazil\u2019s unemployment rate jumped from a little more than 6 percent in 2014 to a little less than 14 percent in 2017.\n\n[Who is Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s next president?]\n\nIn normal times, this kind of economic failure would just be a political one for the party in power. It would lose the next election to its main rival. But these were not normal times. A pervasive corruption scandal at the state-owned oil company implicated not only the center-left Workers Party, but also the center-right Democratic Movement party. That meant there was an opening for someone to argue that it was time to throw all the bums out \u2014 and with a vigor that wasn\u2019t necessarily compatible with democratic niceties.\n\nThat\u2019s how Bolsonaro \u2014 who praised Brazil\u2019s earlier military dictatorship, dedicated his vote to impeach former president Dilma Rousseff to the colonel who had tortured her, spoke of his desire to get rid of democracy altogether, told a female lawmaker that she was too ugly to rape, said it would be better to be dead than gay and denigrated the country\u2019s black minority \u2014 managed to win a majority in the second round of presidential voting.\n\nThe same sort of thing happened in Hungary. Various corruption scandals took down its mainstream right-wing parties, then the financial crisis took down its mainstream left-wing one. At that point, Viktor Orban\u2019s Fidesz party was able to win enough votes that it could rig all the future elections in its favor. The result is that Hungary is now less a multiparty democracy and more a one-party state.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that even if history ever does \u201cend\u201d \u2014 in the sense that liberal democracy is ascendant \u2014 that it\u2019s always just a few bad decisions and few bad quarters of GDP growth from coming back.", "\n\nMore than 220 people from more than 40 countries are sworn in as naturalized U.S. citizens in Phoenix on July 4. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump has claimed that he\u2019s preparing an executive order that would end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship for babies born in the United States to noncitizens. If enacted, such an executive order will surely be met with legal challenges, and many experts are already questioning the constitutionality of the move.\n\nHow does the American public feel about the issue of birthright citizenship and potential efforts to amend the Constitution to eliminate the policy? Here are three key findings.\n\n[What 500 elections in 28 European countries can tell us about the effects of anti-immigration campaign rhetoric]\n\n1. Public opinion depends on how you ask the question\n\nAs pollster Patrick Murray pointed out, public opinion on birthright citizenship \u2014 like on many issues \u2014 depends in part on how the question is asked. Americans seem more evenly divided on ending birthright citizenship for the children of \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants as opposed to \u201cundocumented\u201d or \u201cunauthorized\u201d immigrants. For example, a September 2015 CNN/ORC poll found that 49 percent opposed automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who are in the country illegally, while 50 percent supported citizenship for these children.\n\nBut in an August 2015 MSNBC/Telemundo/Marist poll, only 31 percent said that the Constitution \u201cshould be changed so children of undocumented immigrants are not automatically granted citizenship,\u201d while 62 percent said \u201cwe should continue to grant birthright citizenship to all children born in the U.S.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent survey \u2014 the 2016 American National Election Study (ANES) \u2014 respondents were asked whether \u201cthe U.S. Constitution should be changed so that the children of unauthorized immigrants do not automatically get citizenship if they are born in this country.\u201d In this survey, 30 percent favored this change, 41 percent opposed it, and 29 percent said they neither favored nor opposed it.\n\n2. Republicans and Democrats\u2019 opinions differ \u2014 but Republicans are more divided\n\nUnsurprisingly, there are differences in how Democrats and Republicans feel about this issue. In the ANES, 45 percent of Republicans favored amending the Constitution to eliminate birthright citizenship, compared to only 20 percent of Democrats. A similar divide can be seen among Trump voters and those who supported Hillary Clinton.\n\nHowever, this suggests no real consensus among Republicans: Over 25 percent opposed this proposal and 29 percent of Republicans did not favor or oppose it. Trump\u2019s stance may therefore attract opposition within his own party \u2014 as, indeed, has already happened.\n\n[Trump wants to change the rules of citizenship. Here are three reasons his proposal might be unconstitutional.]\n\n3. Ending birthright citizenship is particularly unpopular among Latinos, younger voters and those with college degrees\n\nViews of birthright citizenship also depend on demography. According to the ANES, the proposal is not necessarily popular among any racial or ethnic group \u2014 only 34 percent of whites and 28 percent of blacks support it \u2014 but it is particularly unpopular among Latinos. Only 14 percent of Latinos support it while the majority, 62 percent, opposes it.\n\nSimilarly, opposition to ending birthright citizenship is more prevalent among those 40 years old and younger (46 percent) vs. those 41-60 (38 percent) or 61 and older (36 percent). These results are consistent with other generational differences in attitudes about immigrants.\n\nOpposition is also more prevalent among those with a college degree (45 percent) than those without (38 percent). But among no group does a majority \u2014 or anything close to it \u2014 clearly support Trump\u2019s proposal.\n\n[Is Trump\u2019s refugee policy really so extraordinary? The walk isn\u2019t, but the talk is.]\n\nEnding birthright citizenship is more white identity politics\n\nMany commentators have noted that Trump\u2019s proposed executive order could be an effort to appeal to his base. But it is also an appeal to the politics of white identity. In my forthcoming book \u201cWhite Identity Politics,\u201d I show that white Americans who feel a sense of solidarity with their racial group and a sense of racial grievance are not only more likely to have voted for Trump in 2016 but also more likely to support eliminating birthright citizenship.\n\nFor example, 48 percent of whites who say their racial identity is extremely important to them would eliminate birthright citizenship, compared with 32 percent of the whites who do not identify with whites. This relationship persists even after accounting for racial prejudice, partisanship, education and other factors in a statistical model.\n\nThese results confirm what many commentators have suggested: Trump\u2019s potential proposal to end birthright citizenship is perfectly consistent with an identity politics centered on white grievances.\n\nAshley Jardina is an assistant professor of political science at Duke University. Her book \u201cWhite Identity Politics\u201d is forthcoming from Cambridge University Press in 2019.", "Lila Corwin Berman is professor of history and director of the Feinstein Center for American Jewish History at Temple University.\n\nI am a historian of American Jews. My morning last Saturday began with a bar mitzvah at our synagogue in Philadelphia; an hour into it, I left with my son to take him to a squash lesson at a private club. In my profession, we call this \u201cthe American-Jewish synthesis\u201d: the ability to be Jewish and American all at once. Historians like me have spent decades explaining how and why Jews have been able to achieve this.\n\nThen I saw the news of the Tree of Life shooting in Pittsburgh. In my unfurling of emotions \u2014 including visceral anxiety about the safety of my daughter, whom I had left at synagogue \u2014 I confronted a notion that my training as an American Jewish historian had not equipped me to understand. In fact, it had done the opposite: It had allowed me to believe that the United States was an exceptional place for Jews. The American Jewish story as written and taught by historians like me has been one of progress, of steadily inching past old dangers to success in a new land. Sixty percent of Jews in America have completed college or grad school. A larger share of Jews than of any other religious group earns incomes over $100,000. Jews can feel at home in America more easily than we could anywhere else in the history of the world.\n\nWhat I\u2019d never truly contemplated was whether this story of American Jewish exceptionalism can last.\n\nFrom a very early time, Jews have wanted to believe that America is different from other places. In the famous correspondence between George Washington and the congregants at a Newport, R.I., synagogue, American Jews supplied the first president with the language to explain why Enlightenment hopes could become reality in the United States: the government \u201cto bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution no assistance,\u201d they wrote to the president, and he echoed those words back to them.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, even as Jews in the United States faced prejudice \u2014 bans on their ability to hold public office, official expulsion orders and myriad forms of social exclusion \u2014 they continued to voice their faith that America was a better place than others where Jews had lived. Political and economic restrictions, including punishing communal taxes extracted in exchange for the right to conduct Jewish life, had bedeviled Jews in many European countries. Here, Jews could build synagogues and even get tax exemptions for them, just as churches did, or incorporate voluntary associations legally and participate in America\u2019s expanding civic life.\n\nWhen a swell of Jewish immigrants arrived from Eastern Europe later that century, they learned to see the United States as \u201cThe Promised Land \u201d (the title of a famous immigrant autobiography), despite rising nativism. Economic opportunity, paired with legal protections, fueled Jews\u2019 patriotism. Although many immigrants pined for the homes and families they had left behind, they embraced America, enrolling in classes to learn how to speak, cook and dress like Americans. And when the United States entered World War I, Jews volunteered to fight and die for their new country.\n\n[How Trump\u2019s immigrant bashing feeds white supremacists\u2019 obsession with Jews]\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Congress voted to stanch the flow of immigrants from nations with populations classified as undesirable. But even as the nations from which millions of Jews had emigrated to America were targeted in restrictive immigration policies and false theories about Jews\u2019 conspiracies for global control and their desires to hold power for their own gain circulated widely, American Jews still kept faith in the unique nature of their \u201cgolden land .\u201d Jews voted in droves for Franklin Roosevelt, supporting the New Deal Democrat with growing zeal each of the four times he ran for president. They saw in FDR\u2019s politics a kind of liberalism that would balance the rights of individuals with protections for groups. Despite pro-Nazi rallies and coordinated acts of anti-Semitism \u2014 most infamously a 1939 rally that filled Madison Square Garden \u2014 American Jews continued to see an exceptional future for themselves and their children in the United States.\n\nNothing confirmed the rightness of American Jews\u2019 bet more than the destruction of European Jewry. All of them, from the secular to the devout and the radical to the assimilationist, had to confront the \u201caccident of geography ,\u201d as midcentury Jewish intellectual Irving Howe put it, that had saved them from the gas chambers. Their belief in the exceptional nature of the United States seemed provident: Here, unlike in other countries, they could use political, economic and intellectual tools to protect themselves. After World War II, Jews helped create the language, laws and institutions that would form the infrastructure of American campaigns against prejudice of all kinds, not just anti-Semitism. Through radio and television ads, social research and political activism, American Jews played a significant role in crafting the rhetoric of tolerance and social harmony. In doing so, they trained Americans to see anti-Semitism as unacceptable and made the case for the rights of minorities more broadly in the United States.\n\nIn the 1950s, Jewish leaders, from rabbis to intellectuals to the heads of prominent institutions, argued that Jews would be only as accepted as the least-accepted people in America. Yet by the 1960s and 1970s, many Jews acknowledged that they had more power than African Americans and other racial minority groups; Jews could often be accepted even if these groups were not. And Jews disproportionately joined civil rights marches and fought legal battles to help these groups (though some Jews also asked why African Americans were not succeeding as they had). A high level of engagement with American politics demonstrated that most Jews continued to believe that, just as the United States had delivered on its promise to them, it could, if pushed properly, do so for others. However much further America had to go, if it had avoided the anti-Semitic impulses that had led so many other nations into tragic historical moments, this surely was a sign that progress could be made.\n\n[How much responsibility does Trump have for the synagogue shooting?]\n\nIronically, that very faith would eventually pose a fundamental question about Jewish endurance: Would Jews achieve so much progress in the United States that they would stop being Jewish? By the 1970s, Jewish leaders had started to identify the impediments to Jewish life as internal, not external. They worried that America offered so much acceptance that young Jews would have no use for their history and heritage. At a 1971 conference, a prominent New York rabbi and communal leader predicted forebodingly (and hyperbolically), \u201cWe are likely to lose more Jews through intermarriage and assimilation in the decades to come than we have already lost through the pogrom and the Holocaust.\u201d The language of Jewish survival and continuity became the rallying cry of an American Jewry worried about its undoing through its success.\n\nBy the early 2000s, this was the face of American Jewish exceptionalism: well-funded trips to Israel to allow young Jews to discover or recover their birthright; endowed Jewish studies programs and gleaming new college Hillel buildings supported by funders who wanted Jews to find other Jews on campus; and countless surveys of Jewish communities to measure whether Jews were still Jewish. By the new millennium, non-Jewish American politicians seemed as intent \u2014 sometimes more intent \u2014 upon denouncing perceived anti-Semitism as were American Jews themselves.\n\nNow I wonder if I will look back on those innocent minutes last Saturday between the bar mitzvah and the squash club as the last of an illusion, one that should never have lasted this long. Impossible will be our celebrations of \u201cOnly in America,\u201d the name of a standing exhibit at the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia. The treatment of American Jews is not a bellwether of overall American progress \u2014 instead, it may be one of the most exceptional things about the United States. It is not the exception that proves the rule; it is just an exception and, perhaps, an unreliable one.\n\n[Trump doesn\u2019t understand how anti-Semitism works. Neither do most Americans.]\n\nThe problem with the deep-seated faith Jews have maintained in America is that it has propped up a broader vision of American exceptionalism and occluded the damages of exceptionalist thinking. As a description of American Jewish life, exceptionalism has brushed under the rug the exclusion and discrimination Jews have faced. Worse, it has stood in the way of an honest reckoning with the violent possibilities that have long simmered under the surface of its claims. The Pittsburgh shooting, on top of the more open expressions of anti-Semitism in the past few years, makes that brutally clear.\n\nFor American Jews, that reckoning will be painful. It will challenge the very basis of our acceptance in this country and make us ask whether the opportunities and privileges we gained came not because America held particular promise for Jews, but rather because it withheld that promise in so many ways to so many other people. Should we ever have believed in American exceptionalism, even just for Jews, when all around us was evidence of the limitations and ravages of that exceptionalism?\n\nPresident Trump displays how easily exceptionalism can become a weapon for exclusion; this is the very purpose of \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d The president legitimizes white supremacy as one of \u201cboth sides\u201d of American life. He declares himself to be a nationalist without bothering to distinguish between his nationalism and the dark history of xenophobic and genocidal nationalism. He routinely gives cover to those who abuse vulnerable populations \u2014 trans people, refugees, immigrants, Muslims, people of color, children and women \u2014 by telling his followers that they are the victims. In all cases, what he calls the \u201cgreatness\u201d of this country is its ability to exclude whole classes of people as unfit and undesirable for its blessings.\n\nTrump renders American exceptionalism irredeemable. Whatever was good or pure about the desire to pronounce our country different or special is, in his framing, explicitly steeped in violence, aggression and hatred. For some Americans, the pain of exceptionalism \u2014 its fundamental exclusions \u2014 has always been clear. For Jews, it has not, but now it must be.\n\nFaith in American exceptionalism, for Jews or for anyone else, will not save us. I fear that faith is destroying us. But we can look anew at our history, as Jews and as Americans. When we release ourselves from the hold of exceptionalism, we will have to search for new ways to explain why America has been so good to Jews in so many ways. And we will have to confront the fact that the Jewish story in the United States is still being written, and progress is not its inevitable conclusion. Perhaps free from exceptionalism, we may discover a new path toward justice and equality for all, without exception.\n\nFollow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.", "\n\nRafael Lozano-Hemmer's \u201cPulse Room, 2006.\u201d (Oliver Santana)\n\n\u2018Anastasia\u2019 at the Kennedy Center , through Nov. 25\n\nThe mystery of the Romanov dynasty continues to inspire (the new TV show from the creator of \u201cMad Men\u201d is about possible descendants of the Russian royal family, after all).

(Theo Rouby/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nParis and the political leaders who hold sway over this South Pacific island chain are 10,000 miles away. The question now for New Caledonia is whether to keep these faraway bonds or splinter off as the world\u2019s newest nation.\n\nOn Sunday, an electorate of some 175,000 will participate in a landmark referendum on independence from France \u2014 a decision that touches on major issues including the economy and cultural identity.\n\nAccording to recent polls, New Caledonians are expected to vote overwhelmingly to remain among France\u2019s \u201coutre-mer,\u201d or overseas territories, a modern-day relic of the once-vast French empire.\n\nThe pro-French side is so confident that it is aiming for a wide enough margin of victory to effectively eliminate any possibility of another independence referendum.\n\nBut the vote also highlights an issue that will not be resolved at the ballot box: the long-standing complaint by some of the indigenous Kanak people that the archipelago has ceded too much to the descendants of French colonists and their culture.\n\nGrand Chief Berg\u00e9 Kawa, 71, has a specific reason that he will vote to secede.\n\nAt the back of his hut, hidden between the looming columns of pine trees and coconut palms, Kawa keeps the skull of his great-uncle Chief Ata\u00ef \u2014 leader of an 1878 rebellion against French colonizers for which he was beheaded.\n\n\n\nKanak Chief Berg\u00e9 Kawa speaks during a ceremony on Aug. 28, 2014, in Paris, before the return to New Caledonia of the skull of the Kanak chief Ata\u00ef, his great-uncle, who was killed in 1878 fighting French colonialism. (Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn 2014, Kawa recovered the skull from Paris after it was found in the city\u2019s botanical gardens. It had been taken to France 136 years earlier, displayed in its museums as a trophy of colonial conquest, and then was lost in the gardens in Paris after World War II.\n\n\u201cIt makes my skin crawl,\u201d Kawa said.\n\nBut, though he has brought Ata\u00ef back to New Caledonia, Kawa cannot bury his remains. The tribal land where he believes his great-uncle should be interred was confiscated from his clan over a century ago. It is now privately owned.\n\n\u201cWe no longer live on our land,\u201d said Kawa, who faces charges for forcing an unwelcome French visitor from his property. \u201cIt\u2019s the white people who live here now. . . . Of course we want independence.\u201d\n\nNew Caledonia, hundreds of miles east of Australia, was annexed by France in 1853. It remains one of 13 French overseas territories around the globe. The last French territory to claim independence was Djibouti, more than 40 years ago.\n\nNew Caledonia\u2019s referendum is the climax of a 30-year process to repair ethnic tensions between French descendants and the indigenous Kanak people. In 1988, a three-way peace treaty \u2014 \u00adinvolving the French state, anti-independence and pro-independence separatists \u2014 was signed to end a bloody civil war, referred to as \u201cthe Events\u201d by locals.\n\nThe accord delineated a transfer of some powers from France to New Caledonia and a steady path toward an independence \u00adreferendum.\n\n\n\nThe burial of 19 Kanak people killed on May 8, 1988, in an assault three days earlier by French security forces in the Gossanah cave, where Kanaks had been holding several police officers hostage. (Remy Moyen/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBut for tribal chiefs such as Kawa, the deep fractures left by colonialism are difficult to overcome without Kanak sovereignty.\n\n\u201cThey talk about a common destiny,\u201d Kawa said. \u201cBut how can you have a common destiny without first recognizing us, the people of this land?\u201d\n\nOn New Caledonia\u2019s streets, there is little sign that the society is roiled by the question over its future \u2014 apart from the flags of blue, green, red and yellow that flank New Caledonia\u2019s highways. The flags belong to the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front, or FLNKS, a coalition of separatist parties campaigning for a \u201cyes\u201d vote.\n\nThe FLNKS was once considered a militant organization by the French state for its involvement in the civil war, though members now hold influential positions in the territory\u2019s provincial governments.\n\nTribal leaders often accuse the indigenous officials serving in provincial posts of being agents of the French colonial system and abandoning the native chiefs, who claim ultimate authority over the land.\n\nBut Sylvain Pabouty, an elected FLNKS minister of South Province, said indigenous separatists must engage with the territory\u2019s politics to dampen France\u2019s colonial influence.\n\n\u201cWhen the government passes public policy, they do so as an extension of their colonial past,\u201d Pabouty said. \u201cWe have to propose a social project that radically changes this colonial way of doing things.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csocial project\u201d generally involves policies to improve the lives of New Caledonia\u2019s poorest Kanaks: regulating water supply in city slums, building hospitals that are accessible to rural populations, opening mines near isolated communes to spur local economies.\n\nIn Noumea, the Pacific\u2019s cruise-ship capital and the administrative capital of New Caledonia, economic life is irrigated by the French state.\n\nFrance transfers $1.5 billion to the territory each year, which in part sustains the wages of Noumea\u2019s civil servants, who can earn up to 1.8 percent more than they would in mainland France. New Caledonia\u2019s gross domestic product is higher than that of all other provinces in France, except for the Paris region.\n\nThe economic benefits are largely spurring the vote against independence.\n\n\u201cWe have faces of a thousand colors here,\u201d anti-independence politician Thierry Santa said at a recent rally in Noumea for his Republican Party of New Caledonia. \u201cAnd despite these differences between our skins, for a great number of us, our hearts still beat for France.\u201d\n\n\n\nA police post in the settlement of Fayaoue in New Caledonia\u2019s Loyalty Islands province.

(AFP/Getty Images)\n\nClimate change is an \u201cunseen driver\u201d behind the thousands of Guatemalan, Honduran and Salvadoran migrants heading toward the U.S. border, one recent article suggested. Food insecurity and poverty in Central America come not just from violence and corruption but also from worsening droughts and changing weather patterns.\n\nAnd Hurricane Michael in early October, perhaps the most powerful storm to hit the United States since 1969, is another stark piece of evidence that our world is fast approaching \u2014 or has reached \u2014 a \u201ctipping point.\u201d The enduring environmental damage from climate change is likely to have broad social implications. But who is most vulnerable to the effects of climate change? And how do we best support these people in times of climate crisis?\n\nEnvironmental catastrophes have far-reaching consequences, from food insecurity to global migration. Globally, more intense droughts and erratic rainfall make it difficult for farmers to sustain sufficient food production needs. Decreasing crop productivity and corresponding market effects ultimately mean that access to nutritious food is an increasing challenge in poorer countries, but particularly in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Recent U.N. reports, for instance, indicate that the numbers regarding global hunger are getting worse, not better.\n\n[There\u2019s grim news on climate change. Will it lead to mass migration and conflict?]\n\nGlobal conversations among policymakers and academics are shifting to focus not only on reducing the risks of climate change but also on preparing to respond to our changing environmental needs on a global scale. The ability of an individual or society to respond to the effects of climate change and adequately prepare for future climate crises is called climate resilience. However, because of social inequalities, some sectors of society are more equipped to build climate resilience than others.\n\nWho is most vulnerable to the effects of climate change?\n\nMarginalized groups such as the disabled, the elderly, children, women and the poor are more likely to experience pronounced effects of climate change. These groups often lack access to resources to help them adapt and prepare for events like drought, severe weather and flooding.\n\nFor those who make their living off the land, the effects of climate change can be devastating. Farmers not only struggle with the loss of income, but also rarely have the financial resources and social networks necessary to recover and prepare for the next environmental crisis.\n\n[The effects of climate change will force millions to migrate. Here\u2019s what this means for human security.]\n\nEfforts are underway to make climate information services \u2014 like weather forecasts \u2014 more accessible, which would help the world\u2019s poorest farmers prepare for climate-related events. The idea is that equipping farmers with better information will help improve production and save crops, fostering resilience under changing climate conditions.\n\nPolicymakers think that these efforts will improve household food security. But what are the best ways to share this type of information, and make sure it gets to the most vulnerable members of society?\n\nDoes access to climate and weather information foster resilience among farmers?\n\nIn our research, my colleagues and I studied how vulnerable populations access climate and weather information. Our work looks at climate information services, adoption of new farming practices and household food security.\n\nHere\u2019s how we gathered this data. In June and July 2014, in four village communities in Kenya and Senegal, we surveyed a random sample of 100 farmers and conducted focus group discussions with more than 200 farmers. We asked farmers about sources of information they received, different farming practices and technologies they used, and when their households ran out of food.\n\nOur research team worked with a development program called Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). CCAFS works to build resilience among farmers in developing countries, including through programs that foster climate information services.\n\nClimate information can be more powerful via people \u2014 not phones\n\nOur research revealed key takeaways. In areas with better access to climate information, more farmers adopted new, climate-smart farming strategies to help their crops grow despite the negative effects of climate change.\n\n[The climate is changing. Here\u2019s how politics will also change.]\n\nThe method used to communicate this type of information was important. There was a big push to share climate information via mobile phones \u2014 but not all farmers identified mobiles as a preferred tool for receiving climate information. Instead, many farmers wanted to hear climate information directly from Ministry of Agriculture extension officers who work in communities to promote good farming practices.\n\nAn important difference between sharing climate information via phones and via face-to-face discussions with extension officers is the ability to have a two-way conversation. When farmers interact with extension officers, they can ask questions. This was especially true for women, who were more likely than men to rely on direct communication with extension officers for information regarding most climate-smart agriculture practices for field preparation, pest control and manure management.\n\nAlthough this study is limited in scope, focusing on four small communities in two countries, it speaks to possible solutions to a larger problem. When people are able to access and engage climate information, they are able to make meaning out of that knowledge and apply it to improve their situation \u2014 but they need to be able to access that information in the first place.\n\nEffective communication and information updates about the rapidly intensifying conditions of Hurricane Michael no doubt saved lives. And better information about how best to cultivate crops under Central America\u2019s shifting weather patterns may have alleviated some of the poverty and desperation experienced by many of the families now in the migrant caravan.\n\nRecognizing that different sectors of society access information from different sources, that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, may prove critical to building a world that is better prepared for the risks of climate change.\n\nChesney McOmber is a postdoctoral associate at the University of Florida.", "\u201cLet\u2019s rock,\u201d he said from a death chamber within Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville.\n\nThose were Edmund Zagorski\u2019s final words before the jolts of electrical current shot through his body. His hands remained clenched, except for his pinkie fingers. They were either dislocated or broken, his attorney would later say, from straining against the straps of the electric chair in which Zagorski, 63, died Thursday at 7:26 p.m. local time.\n\nThe state put the double-murderer to death by electrocution, spurning lethal injection at his request. His death made him the first inmate in five years to perish in the electric chair \u2014 and only the second in Tennessee since 1960. Daryl Holton, a Persian Gulf War veteran who killed his four children in a marital dispute, chose the electric chair in 2007.\n\nTennessee is among a handful of states where the electric chair is still an option in executions. Prisoners who committed their crimes before 1999 may choose to die by electrical voltage instead of a cocktail of drugs. Meanwhile, 30 states allow some form of capital punishment. One of them is Pennsylvania, where federal prosecutors have begun the process of seeking a possible death sentence against Robert Bowers, the man accused of gunning down 11 congregants in a Pittsburgh synagogue, should he be convicted on certain charges.\n\n\n\nThis undated photo, released by the Tennessee Department of Corrections, shows death row inmate Edmund Zagorski in Tennessee. (Tennessee Department of Corrections/AP)\n\nZagorski was convicted in 1984 of first-degree premeditated murder for luring two men into a wooded area under the pretense of a marijuana deal, and then shooting them and slitting their throats.\n\nIn a legal battle that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, Zagorski sought to elude capital punishment based on the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d Between ways of dying, though, he favored the electric chair over lethal injection, in a repudiation of a method seen by some as more humane and technologically advanced, despite a pattern of problems and concern from medical experts. The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is among major drug companies that have prohibited the use of their products in lethal injections.\n\n\u201cBy signing this affidavit I am not conceding that electrocution is constitutional. I believe both lethal injection and electrocution violate my rights under the 8th amendment,\u201d Zagorski wrote last month. \u201cHowever, if I am not granted a stay of execution by the courts, as between two unconstitutional choices I choose electrocution.\u201d\n\nHe reasoned that death at the end of a syringe could mean as long as 18 minutes in \u201cutter terror and agony,\u201d whereas the electric chair would quickly stop his heart.\n\nAt first, the state rejected his request, saying it had come too late. After a federal judge put a hold on the execution, however, officials reversed course. The governor, Republican Bill Haslam, ordered a 10-day delay to prepare use of the electric chair. The state confirmed that it would carry out Zagorski\u2019s death sentence by electrocution, \u201cbased upon his waiver of his right to be executed by lethal injection,\u201d as the warden of the prison wrote to the inmate\u2019s attorney last month.\n\nHowever, his quest to assert a right not to be executed at all was unsuccessful. Again Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, after a majority of justices had decided last month not to thwart the execution. They gave no reasons for their determination, as is customary.\n\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a sharp critic of the death penalty, dissented. She observed of Zagorski\u2019s preference: \u201cGiven what most people think of the electric chair, it is hard to imagine a more striking testament \u2014 from a person with more at stake \u2014 to the legitimate fears raised by the lethal-injection drugs that Tennessee uses.\u201d\n\nJoined by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, she had also dissented from the court\u2019s October order. \u201cOnce again, a State hastens to kill a prisoner despite mounting evidence that the sedative to be used, midazolam,\u201d she wrote, will induce feelings of \u201cdrowning, suffocating, and being burned alive from the inside out.\u201d Midazolam, the powerful sedative introduced first in a three-drug protocol, has proved so forbidding that an Alabama death row inmate asked last year to be killed instead by firing squad.\n\nSotomayor argued: \u201cCapital prisoners are not entitled to pleasant deaths under the Eighth Amendment, but they are entitled to humane deaths. The longer we stand silent amid growing evidence of inhumanity in execution methods like Tennessee\u2019s, the longer we extend our own complicity in state-sponsored brutality.\u201d\n\nHer reasoning stood in contrast to the judgment last month of the Tennessee Supreme Court, which decided 4-1 to turn back a challenge to lethal injection brought by 32 death row inmates, who said the drugs tortured them to death. The inmates did not prove that an alternative means was available, the majority found.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs was Zagorski. Legal filings indicate that within two hours of the state court\u2019s decision, he had informed the prison warden that he would prefer an alternative: the electric chair.\n\nHe spent 34 years on death row, becoming a \u201cmodel inmate,\u201d according to his attorney, Kelley Henry, a federal public defender. She said he had once saved the life of a guard. The last time he was on death watch, other inmates pooled their resources for a pizza dinner in his honor, according to the Tennessean.\n\nOn Thursday, his final meal was pickled pig knuckles and pig tails, the Tennessee Department of Correction said. Inmates in Tennessee are allotted $20 for a special meal before their execution. He ate at 4 p.m., three hours before he was sponged down with saltwater to better conduct electricity.\n\n\u201cChin up,\u201d he instructed his attorney in his final moments, telling her that he didn\u2019t want to gaze out and see her downcast expression.\n\nShe condemned his death as a miscarriage of justice, saying, \u201cThe world is not safer because of his execution.\n\n\u201cHorrifically, Mr. Zagorski was forced to choose between 10 to 18 minutes of chemically burning from the inside while paralyzed or being literally burned to death in less than a minute,\u201d she told reporters.\n\n\n\nIn this 1999 photo, Ricky Bell, then the warden at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville, gives a tour of the prison's execution chamber. (Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nThe irony of the case, said Bernard Harcourt, an expert in penal law and procedure at Columbia University, is that lethal injection, because it was billed as a method befitting more modern times, \u201cmuted our societal consideration of the unconscionability of the electric chair.\u201d\n\nTexas became the first state to use lethal injection to carry out capital punishment in 1982. Since then, more than 7 percent of lethal injections have been botched, said Austin Sarat, a professor at Amherst College and the author of \u201cGruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America\u2019s Death Penalty.\u201d\n\n\u201cLethal injection was supposed to be the fulfillment of a century-long quest for a method of execution that could be safe, reliable, and humane,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut with each invention of a technology \u2014 electrocution replacing hanging, gas chamber coming on to complement electrocution, and then in late 1970s, the development of the lethal injection protocol \u2014 the same hopes were articulated.\u201d\n\nThe prisoner\u2019s decision to revert to an older method of punishment, Sarat said, \u201csignals what we know to be happening \u2014 the breakdown of this idea that lethal injection would be any kind of magic bullet.\"\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nTrump mourns loss of \u2018tremendous momentum\u2019 for GOP due to pipe bombs, synagogue shootings\n\nA German hiker thought she would die in a snowstorm.

He has threatened to tax the remaining $267 billion in Chinese imports to the United States if Beijing attempts to punish the American heartland in response.\n\nBeijing\u2019s tools are relatively limited, given that it buys so much less from the United States than it sells, but it has slapped tariffs on key agricultural imports, such as soy beans and pork.\n\nTrump has also told American companies such as Apple to move their manufacturing lines from China back to the United States \u2014 however improbable that is.\n\nThe standoff has led to increasing talk in Washington of \u201cdecoupling\u201d the American economy from China \u2014 a clumsy word, analysts say, that is tantamount to \u201cdeglobalization.\u201d\n\nAnd that has injected new momentum into Xi\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cI think this is what Xi wanted to do anyway,\u201d said Bill Bishop, publisher of the Sinocism China Newsletter. \u201cBut Trump is encouraging Xi to appeal to his old-school roots, and self-reliance is a part of that.\u201d\n\nThe concerted promotion of self-reliance began with the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement in April that it would ban Chinese telecommunications company ZTE from doing business with U.S. companies. This was punishment for violating sanctions by selling products to Iran and North Korea and then lying about its practices to federal investigators.\n\nAfter talking to Xi \u2014 those were more collegial days \u2014 Trump intervened to grant ZTE a reprieve.\n\nBut the whole incident, which could have destroyed the Chinese company, served as a warning to Beijing that its core technologies were extremely vulnerable to America\u2019s political winds.\n\nThe warning was renewed this week when the Commerce Department slapped restrictions on exports to Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, a Chinese chipmaker that it accused of threatening American national security.\n\n[China\u2019s new booze university wants to change how Americans drink ]\n\n\u201cTrade frictions with the U.S., and particularly the near-collapse of ZTE, has reinforced Chinese leaders\u2019 instinct for technological autarky,\u201d said Yanmei Xie of Gavekal Dragonomics, an economic research firm.\n\nShe noted that China\u2019s Made In China 2025 plan, the state-led industrial policy that is central to the trade tensions, has technological self-reliance as a chief objective.\n\n\u201cHence the irony: China\u2019s bent on technological self-reliance has inflamed trade tensions, and trade tensions have hardened China\u2019s determination for self-reliance,\u201d Xie said.\n\nIndeed, for all the talk to self-reliance, Chinese agents are accused of stealing key industrial technology from American companies, especially in the aerospace industry. Earlier this this week, the Justice Department indicted 10 Chinese people it alleged were stealing aircraft technology secrets from American companies.\n\n[China thinks the trade war isn\u2019t really about trade ]\n\nXi\u2019s calls for self-reliance come amid celebrations for the dramatic \u201creform and opening\u201d movement led by Deng Xiaoping exactly 40 years ago, a change that unleashed China\u2019s economic power.\n\nXi, during his trip across the south last week, visited many of the areas that were pilot zones for Deng\u2019s opening and reform, and pledged to continue propelling the economy forward for a new stage in China\u2019s development.\n\nThe confluence of talk about self-reliance and new efforts to generate reverence for Xi is no coincidence. Qiao, the dissident academic, says Xi is trying to strengthen his power at a time of slowing economic growth.\n\nThis will continue next week, when Xi will deliver the speech at the opening of huge import expo to be held in Shanghai, part of its efforts to promote investment in China. American business leaders like Bill Gates and companies including Honeywell will be there, but the Trump administration has declined to send any officials.\n\nMany outside experts are skeptical about Xi\u2019s economic vision and his pledges to continue \u201creform and opening,\u201d noting his recent promotion of state-owned enterprises. Some even call Xi\u2019s vision \u201cneo-Soviet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is part of a broad structural shift in the U.S.-China relationship,\u201d said Bishop, who doubts the two leaders will achieve any breakthroughs when they meet next month. \u201cEven if Xi and Trump can reach a cease-fire at the G-20, they\u2019re just playing for time rather than returning to a normal trajectory.\u201d\n\nYang Liu contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\n[Trump\u2019s China crackdown enjoys wide support]\n\n[Why China would withstand a trade war longer than Trump thinks]\n\n[China tries to boost its economy for long trade battle]\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nA promotional still photo from the Polish film \"Kler.\" (Bartek Mrozowski)\n\nWARSAW \u2014 In a country where nearly nine in 10 people identify as Catholic, a movie that\u2019s sharply critical of the Catholic Church might seem like a hard sell. But a black comedy called \u201cKler\u201d (Polish for \u201cClergy\u201d) has become a blockbuster hit in Poland, drawing more than 4 million people to cinemas and becoming the third-most successful film here since the end of communism.\n\nThe movie follows three fictional Catholic priests, who are depicted as alcoholics, pedophiles and criminals protected by a powerful church hierarchy that considers itself above the law. \u201cKler\u201d shows priests participating in drinking games and having sex with women. They commit fraud, silence opponents and have connections to far-right groups.\n\nThe film also deals with sexual abuse by priests, scenes that are based on testimony from real-life victims. Its release has prompted a new wave of victims to step forward.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so disturbing to me is how many more cases there are. And people are still being harmed today,\u201d said Marek Lisinski, an abuse survivor who is now the head of Poland\u2019s biggest victims' organization.\n\nScenes from the film are based on Lisinski\u2019s accounts of being abused and attempting to seek justice. \u201cTo survivors like me, watching this movie feels like watching a documentary, because it\u2019s so accurate in showing the powerful mechanisms that protect the Church,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir influence is finally eroding now, we hope.\u201d\n\nMore than 200 new accusations\n\nLisinski\u2019s organization, called Do Not Fear, has received thousands of calls and letters since \u201cKler\u201d premiered in late September. The group said it has heard from more potential victims in that time than it had in the past five years combined. Of those people, about 200 have made accusations the group deems credible and sufficiently detailed.\n\nThe movie also struck a chord among Poles in general. \u201cI watched it because the church keeps saying that it\u2019s blasphemy, and I wanted to judge myself,\u201d said Jorek Hornowski as he left a cinema in central Warsaw. The 32-year old goes to church every Sunday but said the movie had not surprised him. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s based on facts,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of those allegations were known before. But I think this movie is forcing us to finally talk about it in public.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome priests are abusing their authority, and we need to discuss it,\u201d Hornowski said.\n\nWojciech Smarzowski, the film\u2019s director, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that such discussion was exactly the point of the movie. \u201cI wanted Catholic viewers to return to their parishes and to see [priests] as humans and not as saints,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the ruling Law and Justice party openly strengthening its ties to the clergy, some liberal opposition members hope curbing the church\u2019s powers will become a campaign issue during the next general election.\n\nThe church fights back\n\nSupporters of the church have not taken the criticism without a fight: They called for a boycott of \u201cKler,\u201d joined by some cinemas and a Catholic media organization, saying it is anti-Catholic. Members of the Law and Justice party have also lashed out at the filmmakers.\n\nA representative for the Polish Catholic Church refused to directly respond to The Post\u2019s questions about the movie, but he rejected the broader criticism about abuse that its release has raised. \u201cNew cases are routinely referred to our own investigations as well as to state prosecutors,\u201d said Pawel Rytel-Andrianik, a spokesman for the Polish Bishops' Conference, who emphasized \u201cbishops are extremely committed to preventing sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe church in Poland has commissioned a study to examine the extent of abuse by priests and updated its own internal rules, which it says are more expansive than Polish civil law. It also favors a national commission to address the sexual abuse of children, a move Do Not Fear also supports.\n\nOther than that, however, there is little overlap between the demands of secular victims' groups and the church.\n\nOne key question is whether the Catholic Church itself can be blamed for complicity in sexual abuse. Although church representatives have said no, a Polish appeals court upheld a landmark ruling this month that ordered the church to pay more than $250,000 in compensation for an abuse case, possibly paving the way for similar verdicts amid the wave of new accusations.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why many victims still come to us with their accusations and not to the Church is that their representatives refuse to acknowledge responsibility. The Church blames the individual priests, but not itself,\u201d Lisinski said. Shortly afterward, he jumped up from his chair to take a call.\n\n\u201cThis happens all the time,\u201d said Agata Diduszko, a Warsaw city councilor, who was sitting next to Lisinski and has worked closely with him since the release of the movie. \u201cMarek has this rule to always answer his phone when a new victim calls.\"\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t immediately respond to them,\u201d said added, \"they might never have the courage to call again.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPope Francis accepts resignation of D.C. archbishop Wuerl, amid criticism of the cardinal\u2019s handling of abuse claims\n\nTop Vatican cardinal says coverup accusations against Francis are a \u2018political plot\u2019\n\nPope Francis pledges \u2018thorough\u2019 study of Vatican archives on McCarrick", "", "", "", "", "\n\nCongolese migrant women who crossed the border after being expelled from Angola wash clothes near Kamako, in Kasai province, near the border with Angola in Congo, in October. (Giulia Paravicini/Reuters) (Staff/Reuters)\n\nNAIROBI \u2014 A brutal war has raged for over two years in southern Congo\u2019s Kasai province. It is a region that is difficult to access for aid organizations because of its remoteness, hostility from the government, and, of course, the violence. Two United Nations investigators, an American and a Swede, were killed there around the beginning of the conflict in 2016.\n\nOne of the few groups that is present is Doctors Without Borders, commonly known by its French acronym, MSF. It released a report this week that documents a disturbingly high rate of sexual violence perpetrated by armed groups in Kasai. Rapes are being committed many times a day, and they have treated more than 200 victims of sexual violence per month on average since January 2018. Eighty percent of victims said they were raped by armed men.\n\nThe war in Kasai began in August 2016, when a local traditional leader hostile to the central government was killed. A militia named after him, called Kamuina Nsapu, began to target Congo\u2019s national army, which in turn employed another local militia called Bana Mura to suppress the rebellion. MSF started working in the region in May 2017.\n\n\u201cOf the 2,600 victims of sexual violence treated by MSF since May 2017, the vast majority were women,\u201d says the report. \u201cThirty-two were men, some of whom reported having been forced under armed threat to rape members of their own community. Another 162 were children under the age of 15, including 22 under the age of five.\u201d\n\nThe conflict has been characterized by its brutality. Last year, Congo\u2019s Catholic church released a report claiming that it had documented over 3,300 killings. At the time, the United Nations had found evidence of at least 42 mass graves, which they attributed mostly to atrocities committed by government forces. Millions have been cyclically displaced from their homes, fleeing to other parts of Congo and neighboring Angola.\n\nCongo\u2019s president, Joseph Kabila, used the Kasai conflict as a pretense to delay elections in 2016 that would have seen him unseated. Those elections are now slated to take place next month, and Kabila will not be running.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, war spread across eastern Congo and the widespread use of rape as a tool of war earned the country the title \u201cRape Capital of the World.\u201d MSF\u2019s report on Kasai points to a level of sexual violence that is shockingly close to reaching the levels of that era\u2019s far-larger conflict.\n\nEarlier this year, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Denis Mukwege, a gynecologist in the eastern Congolese city of Bukavu, who has treated tens of thousands of victims of sexual violence.\n\nIn its report, MSF warned that its estimate of the number of victims was probably very conservative. Many cases surely go unreported, and others may result in the death of the victim. Three-quarters of those who did seek help at an MSF-run hospital, only did so at least a month after being attacked, raising the risk of complications and the spread of sexually transmitted disease.\n\n\u201cMost explain that they were unaware of the availability of free care or lacked the means to travel to centers offering medical services,\u201d said the report.\n\nThe conflict in Kasai is likely to be exacerbated by the recent forced eviction of about 300,000 Congolese migrants and refugees from Angola, who now must either risk a return to their homes or seek humanitarian aid in this neglected region.", "If President Trump\u2019s torrent of words has seemed overwhelming of late, there\u2019s a good reason for that.\n\nIn the first nine months of his presidency, Trump made 1,318 false or misleading claims, an average of five a day. But in the seven weeks leading up the midterm elections, the president made 1,419 false or misleading claims \u2014 an average of 30 a day.\n\nCombined with the rest of his presidency, that adds up to a total of 6,420 claims through Oct. 30, the 649th day of his term in office, according to The Fact Checker\u2019s database that analyzes, categorizes and tracks every suspect statement uttered by the president.\n\nThe flood of presidential misinformation has picked up dramatically as the president has barnstormed across the country, holding rallies with his supporters. Each of those rallies usually yields 35 to 45 suspect claims. But the president often has tacked on interviews with local media (in which he repeats the same false statements) and gaggles with the White House press corps before and after his trips.\n\nSo that adds up to 84 claims on Oct. 1, when he held a rally in Johnson City, Tenn.; 83 claims on Oct. 22, when he held a rally in Houston; and 78 claims on Oct. 19, when he held a rally in Mesa, Ariz.\n\nPut another way: September was the second-biggest month of the Trump presidency, with 599 false and misleading claims. But that paled next to October, with almost double: 1,104 claims, not counting Oct. 31.\n\nThe burden of keeping track of this verbiage has consumed the weekends and nights of The Fact Checker staff. We originally had planned to include Oct. 31 in this update, but the prospect of wading through 20 tweets and the nearly 10,000 words Trump spoke that day was too daunting for our deadline.\n\nThe president\u2019s proclivity to twist data and fabricate stories is on full display at his rallies. He has his greatest hits: 120 times he had falsely said he passed the biggest tax cut in history, 80 times he has asserted that the U.S. economy today is the best in history and 74 times he has falsely said his border wall is already being built. (Congress has allocated only $1.6 billion for fencing, but Trump also frequently mentioned additional funding that has not yet been appropriated.)\n\nBut there are many curious moments, too, suggesting the president is walled off from contradictory information.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump emphatically denied he had imposed many tariffs. \u201cI mean, other than some tariffs on steel \u2014 which is actually small, what do we have? . . . Where do we have tariffs? We don\u2019t have tariffs anywhere,\u201d he insisted. The newspaper responded by printing a list of $305 billion tariffs on many types of U.S. imports.\n\nNearly 25 times, he has claimed that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was No. 1 in his class at Yale University or at Yale Law School. The law school does not rank, and Kavanaugh graduated cum laude from the college \u2014 the third level, below summa cum laude and magna cum laude. At the time, Yale granted honors rather liberally, so nearly 50 percent of the class graduated with honors, with half of those cum laude.\n\nThis is one of those facts that can be easily checked with a Google search, yet the president persists with his falsehood.\n\nSimilarly, Trump attacked Richard Cordray, a Democrat running for governor in Ohio, for having spent $250 million on renovating the building for the agency he once ran, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That was almost double the actual cost. Oddly, Trump added that after Cordray spent \u201c$50 million on some elevators, it turned out they didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTrump lives in expensive housing, but that\u2019s a fantasy. The most expensive elevator ever is the 1,070-foot-high Bailong Elevator, set in a Chinese mountain range. It cost $20 million.\n\nThirteen times, Trump invented whole-cloth stories about Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), the lead plaintiff in a steadily advancing lawsuit that could open up the Trump Organization\u2019s books to lawmakers. Trump falsely claimed Blumenthal said he was a war hero and fought in Vietnam\u2019s Da Nang province. \u201cWe call him \u2018Da Nang Richard.\u2019 \u2018Da Nang\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s his nickname,\u201d Trump said. Blumenthal described his military record in misleading or false terms on a few occasions before he was elected to the Senate in 2010, but he never said he fought in the theater. Trump also said Blumenthal dropped out of the Senate race (no), barely won anyway (no) and was crying when he apologized (no).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like liberating, like a war, like there\u2019s a foreign invasion. And they occupy your country. And then you get them out through whatever. And they call it liberation,\u201d Trump declared in Mosinee, Wis., on Oct. 24. Some audience members began yelling, \u201cGet the hell out.\u201d\n\nThis dystopian vision of a violent gang overrunning cities and towns across the United States is divorced from reality. MS-13 operates in a few areas such as Los Angeles, Long Island and the Washington region. It\u2019s a gross exaggeration to say that towns are being liberated from MS-13, as if they had been captured.\n\nMost striking, the tone of Trump\u2019s attacks on Democrats escalated the closer the election approached. The president always had slammed Democrats, but his rhetoric became sharper and increasingly inaccurate in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThey want to erase our gains and plunge our country into a nightmare of gridlock, poverty, chaos and, frankly, crime, because that\u2019s what comes with it,\u201d he said on Oct. 4. \u201cThe Democrat Party is radical socialism, Venezuela and open borders. It\u2019s now called, to me \u2014 you\u2019ve never heard this before, the Party of Crime. It\u2019s a Party of Crime, it\u2019s what it is. And to pay for their socialism, which is going to destroy our country.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 18, in Missoula, Mont., Trump falsely said no one even challenges his description of the Democrats as the party of crime. \u201cDemocrats have become the party of crime. It\u2019s true. Who would believe you could say that and nobody even challenges it. Nobody\u2019s ever challenged it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut then he had an unusual moment of doubt. \u201cMaybe they have. Who knows? I have to always say that, because then they\u2019ll say they did actually challenge it, and they\u2019ll put like \u2014 then they\u2019ll say he gets a Pinocchio. So maybe they did challenge it, but not very much.\"\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "President Trump complained, once again, on Thursday that the recent mail-bomb scare and Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooting had \u201cstopped a tremendous momentum\u201d for Republicans ahead of next week\u2019s midterms.\n\nSpeaking to an energized crowd in an airplane hangar decorated with American flags in Columbia, Mo., the president took time at the end of his speech to brag about the \u201ctremendous numbers\u201d of Republicans going to vote.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nOn Oct. 2, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi walked into his country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul for what he hoped would be a routine visit to get some documents. Instead, he was slain during that visit, and his killing sparked a global backlash against Saudi Arabia and its powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSome of the details of what happened in the consulate have been confirmed, but a number of key questions in the case are still unanswered:\n\n1. What happened to Khashoggi\u2019s body?\n\nOn Wednesday, Turkish investigators laid out the most detailed explanation yet of how Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post and prominent critic of Saudi leaders, was killed. They said the journalist was strangled as soon as he entered the consulate, in line with a premeditated plan.\n\nBut Khashoggi\u2019s body still has not been found. Saudi officials previously said that the body was given to a \u201clocal collaborator\u201d for disposal, but Turkish investigators have suggested that person may not exist. Instead, they are considering whether Khashoggi\u2019s dismembered body was destroyed in acid, either in the consulate or the nearby residence of the Saudi consul general.\n\n\u201cKhashoggi\u2019s body was not in need of burying,\u201d a senior Turkish official told The Washington Post.\n\nThe remains might give investigators a number of key clues, but they have a larger value for Khashoggi\u2019s friends and family. \u201cHe did not have a funeral yet. This is not acceptable in Islamic rules,\" said his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, to ABC News, referring to the Islamic practice of burying the dead soon after they expire.\n\n2. How high up did the plot go?\n\nIt took the Saudi government more than two weeks to admit that Khashoggi had been killed, and even longer to say that the killing was deliberate. It eventually arrested 18 Saudi nationals and fired five top officials in response, but Turkish investigators have said the kingdom has offered little practical help in uncovering exactly what happened. \u201cWe did not get the impression that they were keen on genuinely cooperating with the investigation,\" one official told The Post.\n\nSince the early days of Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, there has been a deep suspicion that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the plot. In particular, the high-ranking nature of some of the suspects identified by Turkey made it hard to imagine the plot was independent of Saudi leadership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that an operation using royal guards, other court officials and the consulate was not authorized by the crown prince,\" Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said to The Post.\n\nU.S. intelligence intercepts suggested that the crown prince ordered an operation to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in Virginia. He also described Khashoggi as a dangerous Islamist in phone calls with President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nBut the kingdom has repeatedly denied that Mohammed had any involvement. Indeed, his father, King Salman, appointed him to head a review of Saudi intelligence services that was ordered in response to Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\n3. What will the repercussions be?\n\nSaudi Arabia has been a key ally of the United States and other Western countries for decades. As the second-most-senior royal in his country, Mohammed bin Salman initiated economic and social reforms that were greeted warmly by many foreign allies, especially Trump. His campaign of arrests and crackdowns on political rivals and activists was less commented-upon, and the brutal Saudi war effort in Yemen caused little trouble for Riyadh.\n\nBut the killing of Khashoggi has changed that. Even if the crown prince were not directly involved, the cruel nature of the crime \u2014 and the incompetent attempts to cover it up \u2014 suggest deep dysfunction.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s reputation in the United States has been clearly damaged. Numerous American companies and government officials pulled out of a recent investment conference in Riyadh. U.S. lawmakers have suggested some form of targeted sanctions against Saudi officials, and there is growing opposition in Congress to U.S. support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen.\n\nSo far, though, there has been little practical change. Trump has been reticent to criticize the Saudis and repeatedly suggested that he wouldn\u2019t consider canceling arms deals with the kingdom. There is barely any more action in other Western capitals. Germany is one of the only countries to make a major move so far, suspending arms sales to Saudi Arabia until further notice.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether there will be major changes in Saudi Arabia itself. Though Riyadh is pledging its own investigation into the killing of Khashoggi, that\u2019s unlikely to satisfy the country\u2019s critics. Few Saudi royals have the ability to push back against Mohammed bin Salman, and he appears to still have considerable support from his father and from the Saudi public.\n\n\u201cLife is good here because our crown prince is always working hard for us and making our life better,\u201d Rashid al-Awadin, a retired soldier in the farm town of Al Dilam, said to a Post reporter. \u201cI support him, and nothing is going to change that, no matter what. I will follow his lead as long as he is alive.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTo shame a prince, activists want to rename street in front of Saudi embassy in D.C. \u2018Jamal Khashoggi Way\u2019\n\nTrump and the Saudis keep fumbling after Khashoggi\u2019s killing\n\nCanada is outraged at Khashoggi\u2019s killing.

And so, in the final stretch before next week\u2019s midterm election, the president and his allies have launched a blitzkrieg of misinformation.\n\nIn a move unprecedented in modern American history, Trump ordered thousands of active-duty troops to the border to intercept a caravan of Central American migrants, casting them as a menacing \u201cinvasion\u201d of \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d and other shadowy elements. His allies at right-wing media outlets spread lurid conspiracy theories about liberals enabling disease-bearing foreigners to infiltrate the country.\n\nEven as attention shifted to a spate of right-wing violence, including the slaughter of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue that critics linked to the president\u2019s rhetoric, Trump barreled on, undaunted. On Thursday, he gave a speech at the White House where he warned that U.S. troops would shoot violent migrants at the border. He also shared an ad that sought to connect the Democratic Party to murders carried out by a man twice deported to Mexico, and then to link the man\u2019s murderous behavior to the supposed threat posed by all migrants.\n\nThe ad was denounced by Democrats, along with a handful of Republican politicians, as a race-baiting bid to appeal to hard-line conservatives. \u201cIt follows an increasing trend of rather shameless misrepresentations and even dog whistles that GOP candidates and the party as a whole seem only too happy to associate themselves with \u2014 as if they\u2019ve recognized Trump\u2019s success with this approach and have decided they might as well do it themselves and own it,\u201d wrote my colleague Aaron Blake.\n\nThis overt turn toward white nationalism is perhaps the dominant theme of Trump\u2019s time in office. And while it may be a cynical electoral gimmick for Trump himself, there are senior advisers in the White House who harbor sweeping, anti-immigrant visions for America \u2014 and are arguably as focused on curtailing legal immigration as they are illegal crossings.\n\n\u201cWhile the president himself may be acting on some mix of impulse and improv,\u201d noted McKay Coppins of the Atlantic, \u201cthe roots of the strategy go deeper \u2014 and its architects in the West Wing are looking far beyond the current election cycle.\u201d\n\nThe drumbeat of demographic doom coming from the White House has prompted some commentators to start using the F-word. \u201cFascism\u2019s central idea, appearing in a small repertoire of familiar guises, is that there are classes of human beings who deserve diminishment and destruction because they\u2019re for some reason (genetic, cultural, whatever) inherently inferior to \u2018us,\u2019\u201d observed Bosnian-American author Aleksandar Hemon in an essay this week.\n\nThough Trump frames his politics as \u201ca discourse of victimization and national self-defense,\u201d it carries a far more poisonous message. \u201cThey are contaminating our nation/race; they are destroying our culture; we must do something about them or perish,\u201d Hemon wrote, invoking the arguments of ultranationalists. \u201cAt the end of such an ideological trajectory is always genocide, as it was the case in Bosnia.\u201d\n\nOther analysts caution against such strident conclusions. \u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric about immigrants and others appalls me. But that\u2019s not in the same category as establishing a fascist dictatorship,\u201d wrote Post columnist Megan McArdle. \u201cNor is tightening our immigration policy very much like invading other countries and sending millions of citizens to extermination camps. It\u2019s offensive lunacy to suggest that these things are somehow inextricably linked.\u201d\n\nBut that isn\u2019t quite the point. To link Trump to fascism is not to assume that he\u2019s the second coming of Hitler; it is to point to worrying currents swirling through American democracy and the treacherous path down which the president is leading the nation.\n\nIn a new book, Yale philosopher Jason Stanley connected Trump\u2019s demagogic instincts to earlier authoritarian moments. He observed how Trump\u2019s stated mission to defeat Washington corruption \u2014 \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d \u2014 echoed the anti-corruption politics of 20th century fascists, who rode anti-establishment feeling to power only to engage in widespread graft of their own.\n\n\u201cCorruption, to the fascist politician is really about the corruption of purity rather than of law,\u201d wrote Stanley. \u201cOfficially, the fascist politician\u2019s denunciations of corruption sound like a denunciation of political corruption. But such talk is intended to evoke corruption in the sense of the usurpation of traditional order.\u201d (Indeed, the Trump administration, embroiled in myriad ethical scandals involving key officials, is an archetypical swamp creature.)\n\nTrump\u2019s pitch is aimed precisely at voters who believe the \u201ctraditional order\u201d is being subverted, those who yearn for the restoration of a mythical American grandeur. His critics have argued that he panders to such divisive, ultranationalist sentiment because his party is fighting a losing battle on key issues such as health care and taxes. A fascist culture war presents their greatest hope.\n\nThis may be the most desperate and vile ad since Willie Horton. Trump and Republicans don't want to talk about the fact that they plan to repeal the ACA, gut Social Security, Medicare, & Medicaid, and cut taxes even further for their donors, so they've resorted to fearmongering. https://t.co/xaXNThEOfb \u2014 Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 31, 2018\n\nBut no front-page headline or TV network in the United States would outright label a president, party or segment of the electorate as \u201cfascist.\u201d Indeed, right-wing boosters of Trump have sought to turn the table, framing criticism of the president in the mainstream media as an extension of a supposedly fascist-leftist cabal.\n\n\u201cTrump and some of his supporters mount a strategy of deterrence by narcissism: if you note our debts to fascism, we will up the pitch of the whining,\u201d wrote historian Timothy Snyder, an expert on the atrocities carried out both by the Third Reich and Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cThus,\u201d he continued, \u201cTrump can base his rhetoric on the fascist idea of us and them, lead fascist chants at rallies, encourage his supporters to use violence, praise a politician who attacked a journalist, muse that Hillary Clinton should be assassinated, denigrate the intelligence of African Americans, associate migrants with criminality, run an antisemitic advertisement, spread the Nazi trope of Jews as \u2018globalists,\u2019 and endorse the antisemitic idea that the Jewish financier George Soros is responsible for political opposition \u2014 but he and his followers will puff chests and swell sinuses if anyone points this out.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on journalism he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfake news\u201d follow the Nazi tactic of berating the L\u00fcgenpresse, or \u201clying press,\u201d a phrase that has returned to the political conversation in countries such as Germany and Austria with the resurgence of the populist far right.\n\n\u201cTrump blames the press for attempts to murder members of the press,\u201d Snyder wrote. \u201cHe seizes the occasion, as always, to present himself as the true victim. The facts hurt his feelings.\u201d Voters may add to Trump\u2019s pain next week.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

But Montreal\u2019s Joel Armia scored off the faceoff into an empty net for a second goal in three seconds. After the Capitals were three minutes away from their first two-game winning streak of the season, they instead left Bell Centre with a 6-4 loss. It was the kind of roller-coaster, inconsistent effort that has \u00addefined Washington\u2019s first month of the season coming off its \u00adfranchise-first Stanley Cup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in control of the game, and then we mismanage the puck four times in the last seven, eight minutes,\u201d Coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cWe just give them transition offense.

The Canadiens\u2019 top pick in the most recent draft is one of the key pieces breathing new life into the arena after Montreal was one of the league\u2019s worst teams last season. He got the crowd back to its feet with 3:04 left in regulation, when his shot trickled through Holtby\u2019s legs to tie the game.\n\n[Braden Holtby is always calm, cool and collected ... unless you swipe a puck from a kid]\n\nWhile that was a blow for the Capitals, the game seemed headed to overtime, where Washington would\u2019ve at least gotten a standings point. But as the players digested the stunning turn of events late in the game, they felt they deserved their fate with some sloppy, turnover-laden play throughout. As Holtby put it, leaving Montreal with a win would\u2019ve been \u201cstealing one,\u201d and his play until the last three minutes of the game was the main reason Washington was in control for the majority of the third period. He finished with 38 saves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad we didn\u2019t get the win because I think tonight Holts was outstanding,\u201d captain Alex Ovechkin said. \u201cThe last few goals, the blame is on us.\u201d\n\nSaid center Lars Eller: \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel like we had the win in the bag, but we felt good. We\u2019re pretty good at defending leads, but even with 10 minutes left, we kept making these bad decisions at their blue line and giving them odd-man rushes, which is not really characteristic for us. It\u2019s usually not what we do, and there was too much of that today.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Holtby referred to the team\u2019s schedule for the first month of the season as \u201cstrange.\u201d Washington had three separate breaks of at least three days between games, and perhaps that hurt their rhythm. Against the Canadiens, the Capitals\u2019 passes weren\u2019t crisp, and after they were arguably fortunate to come out of the first period tied, Montreal\u2019s Brendan Gallagher scored twice in the first 3:06 of the second period to put the Capitals in a two-goal hole.\n\nOn Gallagher\u2019s second goal, defenseman Michal Kempny\u2019s pass coming out of the zone landed in Jakub Vrana\u2019s skates, leading to a turnover. The Canadiens got an odd-man rush at the net, and as the puck caromed off the end boards, Holtby hugged the post in an attempt to seal off the left side. Gallagher still backhanded the puck through a short-side hole.\n\n[With Travis Boyd nearing a return from injury, it\u2019s decision time for Capitals]\n\nBut even as Washington\u2019s play has been inconsistent, the team has shown it\u2019s still capable of flashing the talent that won the Stanley Cup last season. The poor start to the second period seemed to jolt the Capitals into responding with three unanswered goals to take their first lead. Ovechkin scored on a two-on-one with center Evgeny Kuznetsov, and 70 seconds later, Eller scored his second goal of the game.\n\nWhile production from Washington\u2019s top-six forwards has been steady to start the season, secondary scoring has been an issue. Eller came into Thursday without having scored since the Oct. 3 opener, and the outburst against the Canadiens felt especially sweet after he played in Montreal for six years.\n\nLess than five minutes after Eller tied the game, Ovechkin scored his second of the game. As he battled for position in front of the net, Dmitry Orlov\u2019s shot bounced off the captain and past goaltender Carey Price for Ovechkin\u2019s 10th goal of the season.\n\nThat gave the Capitals a 4-3 lead going into the third period, when some of the puck mismanagement mistakes they had gotten away with earlier in the game and earlier this season cost them the game.\n\n\u201cLuck seemed to be on our side for most of the third, and then it turned,\u201d Holtby said.\n\n\u201cFor us, it was overall and not just the last three minutes,\u201d Eller said. \u201cThere were a lot of uncharacteristic mistakes for us, a lot of turnovers on the offensive blue line and not executing passes in our own zone.

(Andy Wong/AP)\n\nStocks sank after the White House denied a report that President Trump had directed aides to draw up a deal to resolve the escalating trade conflict with China.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 200 points in early trading before surrendering those gains and sinking an additional 300 points. The benchmark index declined almost 110 points, a 0.4 percent loss.\n\nInvestors were cheered earlier by a Bloomberg News report that Trump had directed his aides to flesh out a bargain for him to bring to his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires. That report came after Trump said in a Thursday morning tweet that he had a \u201clong and very good conversation\u201d with Xi that included a \u201cheavy emphasis on trade.\u201d\n\nLarry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, disappointed investors Friday by denying that Trump had directed any new action. \u201cThere\u2019s no massive movement to deal with China,\u201d Kudlow told CNBC. \u201c . . . We\u2019re not on the cusp of a deal.\u201d\n\nMichael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Hudson Institute and occasional White House adviser, also said talk of a potential deal was exaggerated. \u201cFriends in the White House tell me President Trump still wants the Chinese to make the initial offer and that it better be sincere and comprehensive,\u201d Pillsbury wrote in an email.\n\nEven comments made late afternoon by the president suggesting that unspecified progress has been made with the Chinese were not enough to rescue the market from its latest decline. \u201cWe\u2019re getting very much closer to doing something,\u201d Trump told reporters before leaving the White House for a campaign rally in West Virginia. \u201cThey very much want to make a deal.\u201d\n\nStill, the two leaders will confront a long list of tough issues when they meet. Since Trump began imposing tariffs on Chinese imports several months ago, the United States has broadened its complaints about Chinese behavior to include its military buildup and the treatment of religious minorities in Xinjiang, where an estimated 1 million people have been forcibly confined to political reeducation camps.\n\nFresh trade data on Friday, meanwhile, showed that Trump has made no progress on his campaign to narrow the U.S. trade deficit. Through September, the United States imported $445.2 billion more goods and services than it sold abroad, up from a $404.4 billion deficit during the same period in 2017.\n\nAs importers rushed to beat the scheduled Jan. 1 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, the monthly goods deficit in September with China rose to $37.4 billion, up $3 billion from the previous month. Through the first nine months of the year, the United States has incurred a $301.4 billion deficit with China, up 10 percent over the same time last year.\n\nOn Thursday, the Justice Department unsealed the latest in a series of spying charges against Chinese companies and individuals. The unusual slew of indictments are meant to be a stern warning to Beijing about pilfering U.S. tech secrets that, beyond the trade imbalance, illustrate Washington\u2019s grievances about Chinese commercial behavior.\n\n[As China settles in for trade war, leader Xi emphasizes \u2018self reliance\u2019]\n\nIn a lengthy readout published by Chinese state media, Xi said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to talk to Trump and attached \u201cgreat importance to the good relations with the president.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese assessment also betrayed frustration with the on-again, off-again nature of negotiations between Washington and Beijing. \u201cChina sees the U.S. administration under Trump as inconsistent and untrustworthy,\u201d wrote analysts at Trivium, an economic consultancy in Beijing.\n\nMany analysts were skeptical that anything fundamental had changed in the U.S.-China standoff. There has been no indication, for instance, that Xi is willing to abandon the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d program of state subsidies aimed at securing Chinese dominance in advanced technology industries. China will host an import fair in Shanghai next week that Xi said will demonstrate Beijing\u2019s commitment to \u201cincrease imports and expand openness,\u201d according to the Chinese readout.\n\nThe proximity of Trump\u2019s sudden warming toward China and Tuesday\u2019s congressional elections also drew comment. In recent days, as Republicans confront the possibility of losing their majority in the House of Representatives, Trump has unveiled a flurry of high-profile initiatives \u2014 including a promised middle-class tax cut and a military deployment to the southern border \u2014 designed to woo his voters.\n\n\u201cThere is good reason to be skeptical of this kumbaya moment,\u201d analyst Chris Krueger of the Cowen Washington Research Group wrote in a research note Friday.\n\nXi is expected to make a major speech at the convention\u2019s opening Monday, where he could potentially discuss his vision for further market-access reforms or the government\u2019s role in steering industries \u2014 other areas in which Washington and U.S. businesses are demanding more Chinese concessions.\n\nAfter months of fitful negotiations through intermediaries and lower-level officials, U.S. and Chinese officials hope that a meeting of the two presidents on the sidelines of the Buenos Aires summit will yield a breakthrough.\n\nThe months-long spat has weighed on worldwide markets at politically crucial junctures for both presidents: Trump faces a key midterm test Tuesday, while Xi has been navigating economic head winds and growing middle-class anxieties.\n\nKudlow said at a Washington Post Live event earlier Thursday that he was not sure that trade would be discussed when the two presidents meet in Argentina but confirmed that the two men will sit down.\n\n\u201cThe agenda is being discussed and worked on in both camps,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cI think it will include trade, but I\u2019m not 100 percent sure.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how the progress in high-level talks will affect a new U.S. push to confront China on other thorny aspects of the trade relationship. Federal prosecutors have accused Chinese companies and individuals of spying in three cases in the past two months and pledged more to come this week.\n\nHours after Trump\u2019s tweet, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the indictments are part of a new initiative to beef up the Justice Department\u2019s \u201cstrategic priority of countering Chinese national security threats.\u201d\n\nThe department unveiled an indictment Thursday accusing Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a Chinese state-owned semiconductor company, of conspiring to steal secrets from the Idaho-based chipmaker Micron.\n\nEarlier this week, prosecutors unveiled charges against Chinese intelligence officers who they said conspired to hack into aviation firms to obtain engine designs on behalf of China\u2019s jetliner industry.\n\nShih reported from Hong Kong and Lynch reported from Washington\n\nRead more:\n\nWith new indictment, U.S. launches aggressive campaign to thwart China\u2019s economic attacks\n\nCrossed wires: Why the U.S. and China are struggling to reach a trade deal\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "", "", "", "President Trump, joined by many Republican candidates, is dramatically escalating his efforts to take advantage of racial divisions and cultural fears in the final days of the midterm campaign, part of an overt attempt to rally white supporters to the polls and preserve the GOP\u2019s congressional majorities.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump ratcheted up the anti-immigrant rhetoric that has been the centerpiece of his midterm push by portraying a slow-moving migrant caravan, consisting mostly of families traveling on foot through Mexico, as a dangerous \u201cinvasion\u201d and suggesting that if any migrants throw rocks they could be shot by the troops that he has deployed at the border. The president also vowed to take action next week to construct \u201cmassive tent cities\u201d aimed at holding migrants indefinitely and making it more difficult for them to remain in the country.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you better vote Republican,\u201d Trump said at a rally here Thursday evening.\n\nThe remarks capped weeks of incendiary rhetoric from Trump, and they come just five days after a gunman reportedly steeped in \u00adanti-Jewish conspiracy theories about the migrant caravan slaughtered 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in what is believed to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.\n\nTrump has repeatedly cast the migrants as \u201cbad thugs\u201d and criminals while asserting without evidence that the caravan contains \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d \u2014 apparently meant to suggest there are terrorists mixed in with the families fleeing violence in Honduras and other Central American nations and seeking asylum in the United States. The president also said Wednesday that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if liberal donor George Soros had funded the migrant groups \u2014 echoing the conspiracy theory that is thought to have influenced the accused Pittsburgh shooter.\n\nTrump questioned again at Thursday night\u2019s rally whether it was really \u201cjust by accident\u201d that the caravans were forming.\n\n\u201cSomebody was involved, not on our side of the ledger,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cSomebody was involved, and then somebody else told him, \u2018You made a big mistake.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe also called birthright citizenship a \u201ccrazy, lunatic policy,\u201d warning that it could allow people such as \u201ca dictator who we hate and who\u2019s against us\u201d to have a baby on American soil, and \u201ccongratulations, your son or daughter is now an American citizen.\u201d\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s Republican acolytes, from Connecticut to California, have followed his lead in the use of inflammatory messages, including an ad branding a minority Democratic candidate as a national security threat and a mailer visually depicting a Jewish Democrat as a crazed person with a wad of money in his hand.\n\nTrump and his supporters argue that the media and the president\u2019s political opponents call racism or anti-Semitism where none exists as a way to demean him and divide Americans. At a campaign rally Wednesday night in Estero, Fla., Trump sought to link his supporters to the accusations.\n\n\u201cWe have forcefully condemned hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice in all of its ugly forms, but the media doesn\u2019t want you to hear your story,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my story. It\u2019s your story. And that\u2019s why 33 percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is, in fact \u2014 and I hate to say this \u2014 in fact, the enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an online campaign video personally promoted by Trump this week was denounced by Democrats and some Republicans on Thursday as toxic or even racist.\n\nThe footage focuses on Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported Mexican immigrant who was given a death sentence in April for killing two California law enforcement officers in 2014. The recording portrays him as the face of the current migrant caravan, when in fact he has been in prison for four years.\n\nThe 53-second video is filled with audible expletives and shows Bracamontes smiling as he declares, \u201cI killed f------ cops.\u201d With a shaved head, a mustache and long chin hair, Bracamontes shows no remorse for his crimes and vows, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill more cops soon.\u201d\n\nTrump shared the video Wednesday afternoon with his 55.5 million followers on Twitter, and it remained pinned atop his Twitter page the next day. As of late Thursday afternoon, the video had been viewed 3.5 million times.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich (R), a potential 2020 challenger to the president, said Trump crossed a new Rubicon by posting the video.\n\n\u201cWe all go through periods where we\u2019re in a tough race and we\u2019ve got to figure out what we should do, but at some point there\u2019s just an ethical line that you should not cross, and I think it\u2019s been crossed here,\u201d Kasich said in an interview. \u201cThis latest ad is an all-time low. It\u2019s a terrible ad, it\u2019s designed to frighten people and it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) sounded a similar note, saying in a statement Thursday that Trump and Republicans \u201care so desperate to distract voters from their failures on everything from health care to foreign policy, they have sunk to new lows with hateful rhetoric and racist campaign ads.\u201d\n\n[How suburban voters could alter the House on Tuesday and the White House in 2020]\n\nFive days from Election Day, the video underscored the dilemma facing Democrats as they work to calibrate their response to the president\u2019s increasingly incendiary language on race and immigration.\n\nDemocratic strategist Donna Brazile said leaders of her party have two schools of thought about Trump\u2019s video and his caravan rhetoric in general. She said they fear that reacting to it only allows the president to dictate the terms of the debate and \u201cspread the toxins into the bloodstream of the electorate,\u201d but that the tone is so appalling \u2014 especially coming from the president himself \u2014 that they feel compelled to speak out.\n\n\u201cTrump has opened up a whole new playbook to sow discord and to weaponize hate,\u201d Brazile said. \u201cEveryone has seen low politics. We\u2019ve all done low politics. But Lee Atwater would be shocked at the vitriol we\u2019re seeing today \u2014 and, man, Lee was scrappy. This is virulent. It\u2019s bone-chilling. It\u2019s like a toxin.\u201d\n\nAtwater, who died in 1991, was a Republican consultant who was known for crafting culturally divisive messages.\n\nRep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) described the video as a \u201chorribly racist\u201d attempt by Trump to \u201cprey on people\u2019s fears and lack of information about how the immigration system works.\u201d\n\nSome conservatives, meanwhile, cheered the president for ramping up his focus on an issue that helped push him to victory in 2016. \u201cThe clip of convicted cop murderer Luis Bracamontes laughing in a Calif. court is something every American should see,\u201d Fox News host Laura Ingraham wrote in a tweet.\n\nRepublican strategists say Trump\u2019s immigration push is helping the party here in Missouri, where state Attorney General Josh Hawley is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Race has been a sensitive issue in the state, which was rocked by unrest in 2014 after an unarmed 18-year-old African American man was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nAhead of his rally here Thursday in Columbia, the speakers blared \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d Michael Jackson\u2019s ode to peace and inclusiveness. Several white supporters interviewed at the event rejected the notion that the president is racially divisive \u2014 and they said they resented the very suggestion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a racist president and I\u2019m not a racist,\u201d said Meredith Leon, 65, a retired small-business owner from Columbia. \u201cWe want law and order and justice for all people. I\u2019m fed up with everything being race, race, race. Fed up!\u201d\n\nDavid Ewing, 59, a farmer in Tebbetts, Mo., said he supports Trump\u2019s immigration agenda \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s racist,\u201d Ewing said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the far left trying to do anything they can to stop him. I ignore them, really.\u201d\n\nAs Trump has intensified his rhetoric, a growing number of Republican candidates across the country have followed suit. Some feature graphic anti-immigrant messages and images in their campaign ads, while others have been accused of inciting anti-\n\nSemitic or anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nIn Tennessee, a recent ad for Republican Senate nominee Marsha Blackburn features footage of the caravan and warns that it includes \u201cgang members, known criminals, people from the Middle East, possibly even terrorists.\u201d The ad also slams Blackburn\u2019s Democratic opponent, Phil Bredesen, for stating that the caravan is \u201cnot a threat to our security.\u201d\n\nAn ad released Thursday by Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner features ominous music along with footage of the caravan. \u201cA dangerous caravan of illegals careens to the border, two more behind it, and liberal Tom Wolf is laying out the welcome mat,\u201d the ad declares, referring to the state\u2019s Democratic governor.\n\nA Facebook ad being run by the campaign of Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.) features a photo of three heavily tattooed Latino men with the message, \u201cI will protect Georgia from violent criminal gangs.\u201d\n\nAnd in California, the campaign of Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), who has been indicted on charges of alleged misuse of campaign funds, has called his opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a \u201cnational security threat\u201d with \u201cclose family connections\u201d to Islamist militant groups. The 29-year-old Democrat\u2019s grandfather, who died 16 years before he was born, was a key planner of the 1972 attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics. Campa-Najjar has condemned the attack.\n\n\u201cInstead of making an affirmative case for his own record, he\u2019s trying to disparage the character of a fellow American,\u201d Campa-\n\nNajjar said in an interview. \u201cI think that speaks volumes about his policy record.\u201d\n\nThe messaging has filtered down to local races as well. In Connecticut, a mailer recently sent out by Republican state Senate nominee Ed Charamut\u2019s campaign depicts Democrat Matthew Lesser as holding a wad of money with a crazed look in his eyes. Lesser is Jewish, and the ad has been denounced for promoting anti-Semitic stereotypes.\n\nAfter first defending the ad, Charamut\u2019s campaign later issued an apology to Lesser, acknowledging that \u201cthe imagery could be interpreted as anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\nSome candidates who have long made inflammatory remarks on immigration and race have found themselves facing a backlash in recent days. Rep. Steve King \u00ad(R-Iowa), who met in August with representatives of a far-right Austrian party and declared that \u201cWestern civilization is on the decline,\u201d was publicly rebuked Tuesday by Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee. King, who previously retweeted a self-described \u201cNazi sympathizer\u201d and endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate who appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast, has also seen companies such as Land O\u2019Lakes withdraw their support for his campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric also has prompted outrage from a handful of lawmakers from his party, particularly those who are departing Congress or are in Democratic-leaning districts. Republican leadership has largely remained silent.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent critic of Trump who is retiring at the end of his current term, said in a tweet Thursday that the ad featuring Bracamontes was \u201csickening\u201d and that \u201cRepublicans everywhere should denounce it.\u201d\n\nRep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), whose district was won by Hillary Clinton by 16 points in 2016, said on CNN that while he hadn\u2019t seen the ad, it was \u201cdefinitely part of a divide-and-conquer strategy that a lot of politicians, including the president, have used successfully in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Curbelo said. \u201cI hope that type of strategy starts failing in our country, but that\u2019s up to the American people.\u201d\n\nSonmez reported from Washington. Sean Sullivan, Matt Viser and Eli Rosenberg in Washington contributed to this report.", "", "", "", "", "The White House is growing increasingly concerned about allegations of misconduct against Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to two senior administration officials, and President Trump has asked aides for more information about a Montana land deal under scrutiny by the Justice Department.\n\nTrump told his aides that he is afraid Zinke has broken rules while serving as the interior secretary and is concerned about the Justice Department referral, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. But the president has not indicated whether he will fire the former Navy SEAL and congressman and has asked for more information, the officials said.\n\nThis week, Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General referred the inquiry \u2014 one of several probes into the secretary\u2019s conduct \u2014 to the Justice Department to determine whether a criminal investigation is warranted. That referral concerns Zinke\u2019s involvement in a Whitefish, Mont., land development deal backed by David J. Lesar, chairman of the oil services firm Halliburton.\n\nThe business and retail park, known as 95 Karrow, would be near parcels of land owned by Zinke and his wife, Lola. The inspector general is looking at discussions Zinke had with Lesar and others about the development that could indicate he was using his office to enrich himself.\n\nInterior has played no role in the Montana project, but congressional Democrats asked for an investigation in June because the department issues regulations on oil and gas development that have financial implications for companies such as Lesar\u2019s.\n\nNo decision about Zinke\u2019s tenure has been made, the officials said. But the shift within the West Wing highlights the extent to which the interior secretary\u2019s standing has slipped in recent months.\n\nThe White House and Interior declined to comment Thursday. Zinke has indicated that he intends to stay in his post, according to a person who talked to him recently and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.\n\nWhite House officials\u2019 trust in 57-year-old Zinke \u2014 a vocal proponent of the president\u2019s push to expand coal, oil and gas production in the United States \u2014 began eroding at the start of the year, after he traveled to Florida to meet with Gov. Rick Scott (R) and announced that he would exempt the state from the administration\u2019s new plan to allow drilling off the state\u2019s coasts. The move, which was not coordinated with the West Wing\u2019s political shop, exposed the five-year leasing plan to legal challenges and sparked pushback from governors in other states.\n\nBut administration officials\u2019 concerns have intensified as allegations have grown against Zinke, who has denied wrongdoing. In October, Interior\u2019s watchdog unit issued a report finding that Zinke\u2019s travel practices and efforts to designate his wife as a department volunteer had raised red flags among Interior ethics officials.\n\nZinke is the second member of the Trump Cabinet to come under scrutiny from the Justice Department. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s inspector general referred a case involving then-Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s rental deal with lobbyist Steve Hart and his wife, Vicki, to federal prosecutors. That inquiry appears to have lost momentum after Pruitt resigned in July, according to two people apprised of the probe who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nA referral to the Justice Department means prosecutors will explore whether a criminal investigation is warranted. An agency\u2019s inspector general refers cases to the Justice Department only when it has determined that there could be criminal violations and regularly does so before completing its own investigation.\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke testifies on Capitol Hill on May 10, 2018, on a fiscal 2019 funding request and budget justification for the Interior Department. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nNew York University public service professor Paul C. Light, who wrote a book about inspectors general, said in an interview that they regularly notify prosecutors about potential wrongdoing within the agencies they oversee. But he said it is far less common for them to refer cases involving a Cabinet member.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual,\u201d Light said. \u201cA Cabinet officer, that\u2019s a big-ticket issue.\u201d\n\nInterior\u2019s acting inspector general, Mary L. Kendall, is conducting at least three separate probes connected to Zinke. One involves his decision not to grant a permit to two Connecticut tribes to jointly run a casino, despite the fact that career staff had recommended the move, after MGM Resorts International lobbied against it. Another focuses on whether Interior officials redrew the boundaries of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to benefit Utah Rep. Mike Noel (R), who owns property in the area.\n\nThe Montana project is another. When the referral to the Justice Department was reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, it was not yet clear which of the probes had been turned over for possible criminal investigation.\n\nA senior White House official said the White House understood the investigation was looking into whether the secretary \u201cused his office to help himself.\u201d\n\nLast year, Zinke\u2019s wife, Lola, signed an agreement that would allow the 95 Karrow development to use land owned by the Zinkes\u2019 foundation, Great Northern Veterans Peace Park Foundation, as a parking lot. The proposed hotel, retail and microbrewery site is near several properties owned by the Zinkes.\n\nDetails of the land deal were first reported by Politico.\n\nZinke stepped down as the foundation\u2019s president after joining Trump\u2019s Cabinet, and his wife took over in that capacity. But federal records show that the interior secretary continued to discuss the project with Lesar and his son, along with local developer Casey Malmquist.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2017, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, Zinke met with all three men in his Washington office, took them on a private tour of the Lincoln Memorial and had dinner with them. The next month, Malmquist emailed Zinke blueprints of the development and solicited his input.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that whatever assistance you need to protect and promote your vision for the park, please let me know and I will make sure that it\u2019s communicated and executed,\u201d Malmquist wrote in an exchange that Zinke forwarded to his assistant.\n\nThe Zinkes own two companies, Continental Divide International and Double Tap, that have several parcels of land near the proposed project. According to Zinke\u2019s most recent financial disclosure form, he received between $15,001 and $50,000 in rent or royalties from Continental Divide International last year and between $5,001 and $15,000 from Double Tap.\n\nZinke stepped down from his leadership posts at both companies in March 2017.\n\nThe Continental Divide\u2019s properties\u2019 assessed 2018 tax value stood at $858,160, while Double Tap\u2019s properties were $467,400.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Whitefish city planner David Taylor said the secretary\u2019s involvement in the project was limited to the parking and access agreement his foundation struck with the developers.\n\nZinke had expressed an interest in opening a brewery in Whitefish in the past, Taylor said, but 95 Karrow\u2019s site plan did not say who would run the microbrewery.\n\n\u201cThey never said who was going to own the brewery,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAt the moment, the Peace Park \u2014 whose land is valued at just over $501,000, according to the foundation\u2019s 2017 tax returns \u2014 is mainly used for sledding during winter. There is no way to directly drive into the park because the Zinkes have put up a gate at the request of neighbors living along Murray Avenue, Taylor said, so as not to disturb them with additional traffic.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like, \u2018We\u2019ll help you do this if you help us do that,\u2019 \u201d Taylor said, noting that the additional parking would benefit visitors to the development and the foundation\u2019s park.\n\nThe inquiries surrounding Zinke\u2019s conduct are taking place as he is searching for someone the president can nominate as the department\u2019s inspector general. Kendall has served in an acting capacity since early 2009.\n\nIn a phone interview Wednesday, Kendall declined to discuss any pending investigations but said that she supports the idea of Trump nominating someone to serve in a permanent capacity.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, I think the organization needs a properly nominated and confirmed IG,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cThe time is right. It might have been right some time ago.\u201d\n\nMagda Jean-Louis, Alice Crites and Ashley Parker contributed to this report.", "\n\nMigrants traveling in a caravan heading north toward the U.S. border rest Tuesday in Juchitan, Mexico.

(Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nMedia critic\n\nOftentimes, the three major cable news channels \u2014 Fox News, CNN and MSNBC \u2014 find themselves doing live coverage of the same events at the same time: White House press briefings, law-enforcement briefings after mass shootings, hurricanes. And so on.\n\nNot presidential addresses, at least in the late months of 2018.\n\nPresident Trump appeared in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Thursday afternoon to make some proclamations about immigration. It was the same old talking points: There\u2019s a \u201ccrisis\u201d on the southern border, thanks to the caravans moving northward from Central America. \u201cIllegal immigration costs our country billions and billions of dollars a year. . . . We will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws, defy our rules, violate our borders, break into our country illegally. We won\u2019t allow it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the caravan: \u201cSome people call it an invasion. It\u2019s like an invasion. . . . These are tough people in many cases, a lot of young men, strong men.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the news? Well, that requires some sorting.\n\nTrump warns that if any migrants throw stones or rocks when they get to the US border, \"We will consider that a firearm. Because there's not much difference.\" \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) November 1, 2018\n\nThe news appears to be that there is no news: \"My administration is finalizing a plan.\"\n\n\n\nTrump is describing the OUTCOMES \u2014 what the policy is designed to force ASYLUM-SEEKERS to do \u2014 rather than how the admin is actually going to try to make them do it. \u2014 Dara Lind (@DLind) November 1, 2018\n\nTrump has concluded the speech. There was like one sentence of this \"policy announcement\" on asylum seekers and ports of entry. Otherwise, he just said all the things he says. \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) November 1, 2018\n\nThat sorting simply cannot take place at the same time as Trump delivers fear and lies, an impossibility that MSNBC fully recognized with its coverage plan. On her show, \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d host Nicolle Wallace plowed ahead with the news of the day \u2014 Oprah Winfrey and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, for example. Meanwhile, Trump scared the country live on CNN and Fox News \u2014 both of which carried the whole shebang as it unfurled.\n\nWhen CNN\u2019s coverage concluded, host Jake Tapper went directly to the pressing task of correcting what people had just heard. \u201cJust a few fact-checks and, honestly, I could spend three hours doing this. But just a few items here: First of all, the president said that asylum seekers, once they\u2019re picked up, they never show up in court. And then he said something about 3 percent of them show up in court. According to the Department of Homeland Security, 76 percent of people who are picked up and given a court date do show up to court. . . . so that was false. He talked about how there were an estimated 20 million . . . undocumented immigrants in this country. Actually, according to his own administration, the number is about 12 million. He said they had started building the wall. No. If you\u2019re talking about the concrete wall the president talked about on the campaign trail, no, they have not started building the wall. . . . He said Republicans were in unison when it comes to the issue of immigration. Actually, that\u2019s not true. . . . He had this whole thing about how the child separation policy that he got in so much hot water over was a continuation of the Obama policy and then they ended it. That\u2019s not actually what happened. . . . The Obama administration and the Bush administration had policies where children could be separated from their parents \u2014 it did happen. But then the Trump administration gave orders to exacerbate that policy, make it worse and that\u2019s why there was the controversy that there was, that was ultimately reversed,\u201d said Tapper.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThose are just a few, a small number of the issues the president said, talking about this, that were not correct. There are many more, and I\u2019m sure fact-checkers are going to be hard at work, burning the midnight oil.\u201d\n\nOver on Fox News, host Neil Cavuto broke down the implications of what Trump was saying: \u201cAll right, the president making very clear in a sweeping series of remarks here that these caravans, up to four right now, that are coming to our border \u2014 he says they\u2019re not welcome here, they\u2019re not legitimate asylum seekers.\u201d\n\nMSNBC, meanwhile, circled back to the address once it had digested it. You know, like a news organization might do.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether the issue is immigration or taxes or trade. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a week from the midterms or a year from the midterms. It doesn\u2019t matter whether Trump is speaking at a rally or in the quiet dignity of the Roosevelt Room. The president\u2019s relish for lies is unchanged, and live television is absolutely no match for the fury with which his falsehoods tumble forth.\n\nSo there\u2019s no excuse for any U.S. television network to take his appearances live, at any time. The question now is: Which network will be the first to declare that it will not provide a live airing of next year\u2019s State of the Union address?", "", "Columnist\n\nWhen President Trump issues an election-time order to send up to 15,000 troops to confront what many experts say is a nonexistent threat on the U.S.-Mexico border, what should Defense Secretary Jim Mattis do about it?\n\nMattis\u2019s answer, so far, has been to support the president and mostly keep his mouth shut. He gruffly batted back a reporter\u2019s question Wednesday about whether Trump\u2019s troop deployment order was a political stunt by saying , \u201cWe don\u2019t do stunts in this department.\u201d Unfortunately, some of Mattis\u2019s colleagues fear he\u2019s doing just that in implicitly backing Trump\u2019s incendiary talk of an immigrant \u201cinvasion\u201d that requires sending active-duty troops.\n\nWatching Mattis walk the Trump tightrope is agonizing. For many Americans, the retired Marine four-star general is the model of a stand-up guy \u2014 the sort of independent, experienced leader who can steady the nation in a time of division. But in dealing with Trump, Mattis often takes a seat and quietly accommodates the president\u2019s erratic and divisive rhetoric \u2014 evidently believing that it\u2019s better to hold fire and work from inside to sustain sensible policies.\n\nThe danger for Mattis now is that he may be losing credibility on both sides. Trump no longer seems to trust him fully, and some Pentagon colleagues wonder why he doesn\u2019t speak out more forcefully about unwise policies. Mattis\u2019s role in the administration is precious, but so is his credibility as a truth teller \u2014 which is his ultimate legacy beyond any position or medal.\n\nThe border deployment is troubling for Marines of Mattis\u2019s generation because they remember an incident in West Texas in May 1997. As part of a detachment of Marines assisting anti-drug operations, Cpl. Clemente Banuelos shot and killed an 18-year-old American goat herder. Banuelos thought he was returning hostile fire.\n\nThe lesson for military officers back then was that active-duty troops, trained to kill enemies, shouldn\u2019t be used for policing actions \u2014 especially in border-security matters that were highly politicized, then as now. It was \u201can unfortunate use of Marines,\u201d remembers Lt. Gen. Greg Newbold, a retired Marine who\u2019s a longtime friend of Mattis.\n\n\u201cPutting them in a domestic situation in which they are armed and on patrol was inappropriate for combat Marines,\u201d he says of the 1997 incident. Newbold says he is confident that Mattis will steer the current deployment to make sure that forces aren\u2019t in direct confrontation. Newbold is especially admired in the military because he retired early in protest from the joint staff in 2002 because he regarded plans for invading Iraq as unwise.\n\nThe reluctance to commit troops for fuzzy, politically motivated operations goes deep. Explains Newbold: \u201cOne of the things seared into Marines of our generation was the Beirut barracks bombing in 1983. The issue there was whether to use troops in a situation fraught with political overtones, rather than military needs.\u201d\n\nThis recurring problem of seeking military solutions to political problems has become acute over the past month, as Trump stoked fears about a caravan of r oughly 3,500 migrants , now nearing central Mexico, who want refugee status in the United States. Trump fumed in an Oct. 29 tweet: \u201cThis is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!\u201d\n\nMattis was already facing a Trump-quake before the order to deploy troops.

Steve King, who is frequently criticized as aligned with the themes of white nationalism, is in the midst of a surprisingly tense reelection race in Iowa.\n\nAt least one poll has shown his Democratic challenger, J.D. Scholten, within striking distance, although FiveThirtyEight still gives King a nearly 83 percent chance of winning.\n\nAnd growing attention to King\u2019s affiliation with far-right groups and figures, including a Nazi sympathizer, has culminated with the possible beginnings of a donor boycott. A handful of corporations, including Intel and the dairy company Land O\u2019Lakes, have announced that they will no longer support King financially. Even the Republican Party issued a sharp rebuke of King that stopped just short of saying he promoted white supremacy.\n\nThe scrutiny built toward a confrontation Thursday after King was harshly questioned about whether his racially tinged views on immigration shared any similarities with those of Robert Bowers. Bowers is the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect who in social media posts reportedly said \u201cinvaders\u201d were responsible for his \u201cpeople\u201d being \u201cslaughtered.\u201d\n\nVideo of the confrontation between King and his questioner circulated widely after being captured by the political blog, Iowa Starting Line.\n\nA questioner in the room read statements from Bowers and King, then said he thought the two shared ideology regarding immigration.\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t you do that,\u201d King said, cutting the man off. \u201cDo not associate me with that shooter.

King met with far-right Austrians on trip funded by Holocaust memorial group]\n\nAt the forum in Iowa on Thursday, King defended the Austrian political group, saying that the party had purged former Nazis more than 50 years ago, except one with \u201ca little youthful affiliation.\u201d The party is now led by Heinz-Christian Strache, who was active in neo-Nazi circles as a youth.\n\nKing spoke about touring Holocaust sites in Poland before he flew to Vienna, an experience he said was moving.\n\nHis past statements \u2014 King has assailed immigrants, retweeted a Nazi sympathizer and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies,\u201d in what many interpreted as an echo of the language of white nationalists \u2014 have drawn more scrutiny since the shooting massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nLast month, King\u2019s decision to endorse Faith Goldy also drew uproar.

And certainly there is lots of evidence that the GOP is animated these days by an unquestioning devotion to Trump and whatever his ideas may be at any given moment. But the problem is that Republicans are now becoming the party not of Trump but of Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator who in the 1950s accused the State Department of treason, called George Marshall \u2014 head of the Army during World War II, later secretary of state and defense \u2014 a traitor, and implied that the American government was being secretly run by the Kremlin.\n\nThe Republican Party today has become a vast repository of conspiracy theories, fake news, false accusations and paranoid fantasies.\n\nConsider the most recent example. Trump has scared much of the country about a small group of Central Americans, fleeing poverty and violence, who are hoping to come to the U.S. border and apply for asylum. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to oppose letting them in, though it is cruel to demonize them constantly. But Republicans have not been content to oppose granting asylum. They have concocted facts out of thin air and invented conspiracies about who is behind this group of impoverished migrants.\n\nLast week, one of the prominent hosts at Fox News, which is now the Pravda of the Republican Party, suggested that more than 100 Islamic State fighters had been caught \u201ctrying to use this caravan.\u201d Trump, a devoted Fox News viewer, pounced on that claim, declaring that \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d had joined the caravan. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) asked whether Democratic donor George Soros was funding this movement.\n\nNone of these claims has an iota of truth to it. But they are repeated and reinforced across the country. The notion that Soros is the dark mastermind behind all kinds of movements is now deeply lodged in the Republican Party \u2014 so much so that senior party leaders such as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa repeat it almost reflexively. Rep. Steve King (Iowa) has accused Soros of backing a grand scheme to systematically introduce foreigners in order to replace \u201cAmericans\u201d \u2014 in other words, whites \u2014 with \u201csomebody else\u2019s babies.\u201d\n\nThe slurs against Soros are revealing. Let\u2019s remember, Soros is one of the most successful businessmen in history, who made his money in as pure a form of capitalism as there is, reading and betting on the market. He has become one of the world\u2019s leading philanthropists. His foundation has spent more than $14 billion to date, much of it to support anti-communists and human rights groups, first in Eastern Europe and then around the world. He has funded various liberal ideas as well, from prison reform to the legalization of marijuana, many of which are now in the mainstream.\n\nSo why the focus on him? He is not the only big funder of liberal causes and candidates. Soros is not a mysterious figure. He has given countless speeches and interviews and written many books and articles. His Open Society Foundations put all their grants in plain view, on their website. But Soros is a perfect bogeyman for conspiracy theorists. He is rich, powerful, grew up abroad, has a foreign accent and is Jewish.\n\nRepublicans are at pains to deny anti-Semitism as a motivation for demonizing Soros, but the problem is it is not just Soros they target. Many Republicans now speak often and openly of the dangers of \u201cglobalists\u201d \u2014 but for some reason, these \u201cglobalists\u201d tend to be Jewish financiers (Lloyd Blankfein, Gary Cohn, Janet Yellen and Soros). Given the ugly historical smears in this regard, one can only conclude that elements of the Republican Party are either clueless about anti-Semitism or actively encouraging it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. In his riveting book \u201cFantasyland: How America Went Haywire,\u201d Kurt Andersen describes the mountain of conspiracy theories spouted by Republicans these days \u2014 about the United Nations, vaccines, gun control and sharia law, among other topics. Based on zero evidence, in an age of science and technology, these ideas are now more widespread than ever before.\n\nAmerica has a history of paranoid politics, infused with the belief that there is some hidden conspiracy to betray the republic. But these forces used to be peripheral, voiced by marginal figures. When they seemed to be growing, as with the John Birch Society in the 1960s, mainstream conservatives such as William F. Buckley publicly and forcefully denounced them. Today senior Republicans emulate them. Trump has given a ringing endorsement to Alex Jones, the country\u2019s most influential and extreme conspiracy theorist. \u201cYour reputation is amazing,\u201d Trump said in a 2015 interview with Jones. \u201cI will not let you down.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party has many good people and good ideas. But none of them matters while it houses and feeds fantasies, conspiracies and paranoia, tinged with racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism. Republicans are now squarely the party of McCarthy, and until that cancer is excised, they should not be entrusted with power.\n\nRead more from Fareed Zakaria\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his daily newsletter.", "\n\nCollege coaches get fired and new ones are hired every season, but the nature of the events that happened at Maryland have players in flux. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nMaryland commit Lavonte Gater was confused.\n\nOn Tuesday, the three-star Ballou cornerback was told Maryland football coach DJ Durkin would return to the sidelines Saturday against Michigan State. One day later, Gater checked his phone again and found out Wallace D. Loh, the president of the College Park campus, decided to fire Durkin.\n\nThe about-face left Gater, as well as other Maryland commits and recruits, with more questions than answers.\n\n\u201cYeah, you just didn\u2019t know what was happening,\u201d Gater said. \u201cI was finding out on social media.\u201d\n\nCollege coaches getting fired and new ones getting hired is common each season, but what has happened at Maryland over the past few months \u2014 even the past 48 hours \u2014 has disrupted the recruiting process and put Maryland\u2019s local recruits and commits in flux.\n\nAs a result, the increasingly successful pipeline the Maryland program has built with local recruits has been impacted negatively, and some in the area question whether it can get back on track.\n\n[DJ Durkin, Maryland part ways following outcry over coach\u2019s reinstatement]\n\n\u201cI think there are going to be questions on how this whole situation is handled, and it is hard to overcome in the short run,\u201d Good Counsel Coach Andy Stefanelli said. \u201cIt is not a good look for the school and hopefully they can rectify things there, but until then, it\u2019s going to have an impact on local recruiting and there are no two ways about it.\u201d\n\nStefanelli, who has watched several Good Counsel football players play for Maryland over the past decade, said one of his biggest issues was the \u201clack of leadership and direction\u201d from the university. Durkin had been on administrative leave since Aug. 10, amid separate investigations into the circumstances that led to the June death of 19-year-old offensive lineman Jordan McNair and into the culture of the football program following media reports alleging abuse and bullying by staff members.\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s decision to fire Durkin, the biggest question among local high school coaches was: What can they tell players about the future of Maryland football?\n\n\u201cI want to see the situation rectified, and it needs to be rectified soon before I can feel good about feeling good about recommending kids to go there,\u201d Stefanelli said.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt Coach Tom Green, who has sent seven players in the past 11 years to Maryland, said he noticed less of a Maryland presence during the summer and in-season. Previously, under Durkin\u2019s staff, Green has had multiple face-to-face meetings with Durkin about his players, as well as visits from defensive backs coach Aazaar Abdul-Rahim. This year, as Stefanelli described it, Maryland\u2019s recruiting presence has been \u201cflying under the radar.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder Durkin\u2019s tenure, they did a great job recruiting our players and area players,\u201d DeMatha Coach Elijah Brooks said. \"Us obviously being two miles down the road, we want them to be successful so they can continue to recruit our guys. I know kids in the area like the University of Maryland. It was a clearly unfortunate situation. Only time will tell what comes of it.\u201d\n\nBrooks, who has seen eight players in the past three years sign with Maryland, said DeMatha\u2019s staff still communicates frequently with Maryland and the Terps staff has shown continued interest in the players in Hyattsville. Stefanelli said the biggest impact might not affect players to whom Maryland is the only the Power Five school offering a scholarship but rather the more \u201chigh impact\u201d players with multiple offers from big college programs.\n\n\u201cI would like them to look [at Eleanor Roosevelt players] a little bit more,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut right now I know there is so much going on up there right now and I am just going to be patient and I know they are going through a lot and the coaches up there. We are going to respect that.\u201d\n\nGater\u2019s mother, Mia Young, said her son talked to her Thursday morning about the possibility of decommitting from Maryland, but Gater confirmed he was still verbally committed Thursday afternoon. Gater planned on calling Abdul-Rahim, his primary recruiter, to ask how the atmosphere was at Maryland. Abdul-Rahim, a District native, was a successful local high school coach at Friendship Collegiate.\n\n\u201cAt this point, decommitments will happen quicker if there are changes in the assistant coaching ranks, especially with guys like Abdul-Rahim and if they end up at other schools or appear to be ending up at other schools,\u201d said Adam Friedman, Rivals.com\u2019s Mid-Atlantic recruiting analyst. \"As position coaches end up leaving, you will start to see decommitments at those positions and from their recruiting regions so that is something to watch out for.\u201d\n\nGater said he would have no problem playing under interim coach Matt Canada, who has led the team to a 5-3 record entering Saturday\u2019s game. But if Abdul-Rahim were to leave, Gater would be less certain. Canada will remain the interim coach through the end of the season, but any plans beyond that have not been revealed.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m with what is best for the team,\u201d Gater said.\n\nSome stakeholders have speculated that Maryland may target Alabama offensive coordinator Mike Locksley as its next head coach; Locksley, a D.C. native who is considered one of the Washington\u2019s area\u2019s most powerful recruiters, served two stints at Maryland, including as interim coach for six games in 2015 after Randy Edsall was fired at midseason.\n\n\u201cRegardless of what they should have done, the decision has now been made, and they should have a plan for where they are heading, and until that happens it is very difficult to recruit for Maryland,\u201d Stefanelli said. \"It\u2019s going to be very difficult to recruit because are you recruiting for Coach Canada or for the next guy that no one knows? It is not a good situation if you are a current coach trying to recruit.\u201d\n\n[\u2018They need us to help rebuild\u2019: Amid Maryland football crisis, commits remain committed for now]\n\nMaryland has 10 hard commitments for the Class of 2019, including Gater, three players from Maryland and three from Virginia. Two Maryland players, running back Jordan Houston and tight end Trey Rucker, are now playing at Flint Hill in Oakton, Va. Houston and Rucker went on a visit to Maryland on Sept. 22, when the Terrapins played Minnesota.\n\nLast season, Durkin hauled in the 28th-ranked recruiting class in the country with 16 recruits from Maryland, Virginia and D.C. In 2017, the Terrapins had the 18th-ranked recruiting class in the nation with 17 players from the local jurisdictions.\n\nWhen reached by text message after the initial news of Durkin being reinstated Tuesday, Houston replied, \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d He took to Twitter and again supported the decision from the board of regents, but could not be reached to comment after Wednesday\u2019s reversal.\n\nStefanelli said the longer the decision was being drawn out, the more damage has occurred. However, Stefanelli believes there is still a chance for Maryland to salvage the Class of 2019 and move forward with future classes. This can be done by Maryland voicing a clear direction of where it is headed, but until then, everyone remains in a \u201cholding pattern.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Green said. \u201cYou sit back and wait.\u201d\n\nRoman Stubbs contributed to this report.\n\nRead more Maryland football coverage:\n\nA timeline of events at the University of Maryland in Jordan McNair saga\n\nMaryland football players react to DJ Durkin\u2019s departure: \u2018Pressure busts pipes doesn\u2019t it??\u2019\n\nMaryland players involved in altercation amid turmoil in College Park", "", "", "Columnist\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s closing argument of the midterm elections \u2014 an attack on birthright citizenship \u2014 he has again targeted the children of migrants.\n\nI say \u201cagain\u201d because it is something of a theme. There was the use of family separation as a punishment for illegal immigration \u2014 effectively using the traumatization of children, who described cold, hunger and fear, as a tool of deterrence. There was the transfer of migrant children under cover of darkness to a tent city in the Texas desert.\n\nThis time, Trump warns of an invasion of the United States from the womb. The erection of a wall is more complicated in this case. So the president has announced that he is contemplating an executive order that would reinterpret the 14th Amendment to make the citizenship of children born in the United States dependent on the legality of their parents, or something.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all those benefits,\u201d Trump has said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201d\n\nCorrections: The United States is one of dozens of countries with birthright citizenship. And a child born in the United States is not \u201cessentially\u201d a citizen. He or she is completely equal in legal value and standing with the president or any other swaggering fool who imagines that he comes from superior stock.\n\nThis clearly peeves Trump. Good. It was intended to. The Radical Republicans who authored the 14th Amendment following the Civil War wanted to end the Confederate view of citizenship \u2014 which was contingent on color \u2014 finally and forever. The 14th Amendment was intended to be a stake in the heart of bloodline citizenship, which is precisely what Trump hopes to revive. At the time of the amendment\u2019s passage, some members of Congress expressed the fear that birthright citizenship would turn gypsy, Chinese and other (in their view) undesirable children into citizens. Sen. John Conness of California responded: \u201cWe are entirely ready to accept the provision proposed in this constitutional amendment, that the children born here of Mongolian parents shall be declared by the Constitution of the United States to be entitled to civil rights and equal protection before the law with others.\u201d\n\nThe Radical Republicans were quite radical in their determination to prevent some future president and congressional majority from denying the rights of children of any background, as long as they were born in the United States. Trump and his allies are also radical in their determination to turn the brown children of illegal immigrants into criminals on the day of their birth.\n\nThis is not the equivalent of an argument about the feasibility of a continent-wide wall, which is a contest between wisdom and stupidity. The debate between bloodline and birthright citizenship is a measure of how you view and value a crying child in a crib in some Texas hospital, born to parents without papers. You can regard that baby, as Trump does, as illegitimate and unwelcome \u2014 as another \u201cillegal\u201d of the wrong pedigree and the wrong color who will be a drain on national resources.\n\nOr you can view a child born in the United States as a potential worker, a potential innovator or professional, a potential church member and volunteer, a potential father or mother, a potential taxpayer, a potential voter, a potential president. And as a full and equal citizen. According to the Constitution.\n\nAny political movement that regards the plain meaning of the 14th Amendment as an obstacle to its political intentions has earned a great deal of suspicion. Any political movement that views vindictive cruelty against children as a crowd-pleasing political appeal has earned public contempt. Any political party that embraces this agenda of exclusion deserves defeat.\n\nThis issue shows what is at stake in the midterm elections. No one, on either ideological side, will regard the outcome as a referendum on the state of the economy or the direction of regulatory reform. Trump has nationalized the election as a plebiscite on his approach to politics, including the invention of threats and venomous dehumanization of migrants. And he has culminated and summarized his appeal with a plan to undermine the 14th Amendment and deny citizenship to brown children.\n\nIf the Republican Party holds the House and Senate, Trump will take this as the endorsement of a politics founded on racial and ethnic hatred. As it would be. As we can\u2019t allow it to be.\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .", "", "\n\nA political ad released by U.S. congressional candidate Nick Stella uses a photo of Jaywick Sands, a British village, to attack Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif). (Stella for Congress)\n\nIn a strange turn of events, a small British seaside village found itself at the center of a controversy in the upcoming Illinois midterm elections, after a Republican congressional candidate published a photo of Jaywick Sands in Essex and warned that it\u2019s what the United States will look like if Democrats win next week.\n\nThe photo, which was published on the Facebook page of Republican Nick Stella\u2019s campaign on Oct. 25, was an image of the town, which looked run-down. It features a billboard doctored to display a photo of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the words \u201cCongratulations Madame Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly YOU can stop this from becoming reality,\u201d text accompanying the photo, said, urging voters to \u201cHelp President Trump Keep America on Track and Thriving\u201d and warning that a vote for Rep.

The area was originally developed as a vacation spot but later suffered after more Brits started traveling abroad.\n\nStill, things aren\u2019t as bad as the photo makes it seem, residents told various news outlets this week.\n\nCity councilor Kevin Watson told the Associated Press that \u201cthere\u2019s now fantastic drainage, people are taking pride in their area.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings are looking very good in Jaywick, probably the best since it was a holiday destination,\u201d he said.\n\nOne resident, Shirley Blok, told the BBC that \u201cJaywick people dare Donald Trump to visit us, come and feel the British love, see our heart.\"", "\n\nPresident Trump spoke last year during an event on the South Lawn of the White House to acknowledge the final passage of tax overhaul legislation by Congress. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nSenior staffers in congressional offices hold highly inaccurate assumptions about what voters in their districts actually want when it comes to policy. They tend to believe that voters support much more conservative policies than they actually do. And this stunning misperception can largely be explained by the disproportionate attention lawmakers and their aides lavish on donors and special interest groups.\n\nThose are the results of a new paper forthcoming in the American Political Science Review by Alexander Hertel-Fernandez of Columbia University and Matto Mildenberger and Leah C. Stokes of The University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nWhile voters have long believed that members of Congress are focused too much on the needs of special interests and out of touch with the general public, the paper provides some of the most convincing evidence to date that these perceptions are largely accurate.\n\nIn August 2016, the authors sent out a survey to the chiefs of staff and legislative directors of every House and Senate office. They targeted these senior officials because they\u2019re largely responsible for setting an office\u2019s legislative agenda: They play \u201ca crucial role in the policymaking process, connecting the preferences of constituents with Members of Congress,\u201d as the authors put it.\n\nOne section of the survey asked staffers to estimate public support in their own districts (or states, in the case of Senate aides) for five policy proposals: repealing Obamacare, raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, enacting universal gun background checks, regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and investing $305 billion in infrastructure improvements over a five-year period. One could reasonably expect that a congressional aide would understand constituents' opinions on these issues, given that Congress had voted on bills related to these issues in the previous year.\n\nThe authors compared the aides' responses to actual district-level public opinion on the issues, as measured by large national surveys like the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. The results showed a stark disconnect.\n\nAides' estimates of public support for the proposals were way off-base relative to the actual numbers. \u201cIn none of the five areas are staffers estimating their constituents\u2019 preferences with any degree of relative or absolute accuracy,\u201d the authors write. Legislative aides in Republican offices were particularly bad at estimating their constituents' support for various policies.\n\nOn the question of gun background checks, for instance, staffers in Republican offices underestimated public support by 49 percentage points. Democrats underestimated too, by 11 percentage points. Republican staffers also underestimated support for carbon dioxide regulation, infrastructure spending and minimum wage hikes by 20 percentage points or more. Democrats underestimated support for those policies by between five and nine percentage points.\n\nThere was one issue, however, where Democratic staffers were more off-base: Obamacare repeal. Democrats underestimated support for repealing the Affordable Care Act by 24 percentage points, while Republicans overestimated support by 10 percentage points.\n\nOverall, the researchers found, aides in Democratic offices better understood public opinion in their districts by a margin of about 13 percentage points. But with the exception of Obamacare repeal, Democratic aides sided with their Republican colleagues in assuming their constituents were more conservative on the issues than they actually were.\n\n\u201cOverall, we find a conservative bias in staffers\u2019 estimations,\u201d the authors write.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving these legislative misperceptions? The paper offers some clues. The authors checked to see whether aides in more politically competitive districts did a better job guessing their constituents' preferences than aides in safer districts \u2014 they didn\u2019t. Ditto for staffers' years of experience.\n\nThey did find, however, that, like all of us, congressional aides tend to believe that everyone else thinks like they do. If a given aide supported a policy, they tended to think that their constituents did too, regardless of whether that was accurate.\n\nBut perhaps the most significant factor the researchers identified was the role of interest groups. The survey questions yielded a number of key findings.\n\nFirst, aides who reported more reliance for policy-making on business-oriented interest groups, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the American Petroleum Institute, had a poorer understanding of constituent preferences than did aides who relied more on groups drawing their membership from the general population, like the Sierra Club or the League of Conservation Voters. Of note, those business-oriented groups tend to support conservative policies, which could explain some of the aides' conservative bias in their estimates.\n\nSecond, the researchers found that aides in offices receiving more money from corporate interests did a worse job of estimating constituent preferences. In fact, \u201c45% of senior legislative staffers report having changed their opinion about legislation after a group gave their Member a campaign contribution,\u201d according to the paper.\n\nMoney talks, in other words, and congressional staffers are listening \u2014 even if it means becoming less responsive to the needs of their voters.\n\nPerhaps the most alarming finding in the survey, however, was that \u201cstaffers are more likely to interpret correspondence from businesses as being more representative of their constituents\u2019 preferences than correspondence from ordinary constituents.\" The survey asked aides to imagine receiving letters about a policy issue from either \u201cemployees of a large company\u201d in their districts or \u201cconstituents\" and to consider how much those letters represented public opinion in their districts. Sixty-two percent of staffers said they\u2019d view the employees' letters as representative of public opinion, versus only 34 percent who said the same of letters from ordinary citizens.\n\nAll told, the study paints a picture of a Congress that is out of touch with the American people -- with perceptions of public opinion skewed rightward by the influence of deep-pocketed lobbyists. The authors say that the best way to combat these distortions is by increased civic participation among the general public.\n\n\u201cPolitical action can\u2019t end on Election Day,\u201d co-author Matto Mildenberger wrote in a tweet on Thursday. \u201cCitizens need to keep writing, calling and meeting with elected officials and their staffs long after the midterms.\u201d", "\n\nRep.

Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), added a fresh layer of intrigue to an unsettled House leadership picture. With independent political forecasters predicting Democrats as prohibitive favorites to win back the House majority, lawmakers are jockeying for position \u2014 even as the top three party leaders have made it clear that they intend to keep serving.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said she would pursue a second campaign for the speaker\u2019s gavel, and Minority Whip Steny H.

Clyburn (D-S.C.) would seek to move up to majority leader and majority whip, respectively.\n\nRichmond stopped short of challenging that lockstep promotion scenario Friday but said that \u201cif there is any change in our top leadership positions,\u201d the Congressional Black Caucus would \u201cendorse African-American representation in at least one of the top two positions of elected House Democratic Caucus leadership.\u201d\n\nHe cited a \u201clack of appreciation\u201d within the party for the caucus\u2019s recent efforts to turn out black voters and otherwise support the party\u2019s political operations. He specifically cited the effort of Clyburn, a former CBC chairman.\n\n\u201cWhat we need now is the reciprocity we\u2019ve collectively earned,\u201d Richmond wrote in the letter, first reported by Politico, adding, \u201cAfrican Americans deserve more than a simple gesture of gratitude \u2014 they deserve representation at the apex of the party\u2019s infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe ascension of Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn is hardly assured, however, with a handful of sitting House Democrats opposing Pelosi and dozens more Democratic candidates publicly signaling discomfort with her leadership. Pelosi falling short could prompt a scenario where the CBC\u2019s demand could become an important factor.\n\nRepresentatives for Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn declined to comment Thursday. A spokeswoman for Richmond did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nClyburn has been flirting with taking a higher-profile role for months, floating himself as a \u201ctransitional\u201d speaker if Pelosi falls short. But he has also made clear that he would not seek to upset the existing apple cart.\n\nThat, according to several Democratic aides familiar with internal caucus politics, has frustrated younger CBC members such as Richmond and Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who want to take a larger role in the direction of the party caucus. But those members have been reluctant themselves to take on Pelosi, who has cultivated a good relationship with the CBC.", "President Trump said Thursday he intends to take executive action next week to end the \u201cabuse\u201d of the U.S. asylum system, a plan that could include \u201cmassive tent cities\u201d at the southern border aimed at holding migrants indefinitely and making it more difficult for them to remain in the country.\n\nBut Trump offered few other details during remarks at the White House, where he reiterated unsubstantiated claims he has made in recent weeks that a caravan of migrants from Central America, traveling north through Mexico by foot, represents an urgent national security threat. He characterized the group, which includes many families with children, as dangerous and akin to an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks, carried live on cable news, came just days before Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, the latest bid by Trump to make immigration the top campaign issue.\n\nTrump said the emergency steps he plans to take would protect the United States against what he characterized as rampant fraud that threatens to overwhelm the nation\u2019s immigration system.\n\nThe president offered no legal rationale for his plan, and he brushed off questions about the legality of some of the methods he suggested could be employed, such as detaining families indefinitely or refusing migrants a hearing in immigration court.\n\nSuch moves would likely trigger legal challenges from civil rights groups.\n\n\n\nMigrants \u2014 mostly Hondurans \u2014 climb on a truck on a road in Mexico\u2019s Oaxaca state on Thursday.

They\u2019re wasting their time.\u201d\n\nIn a sign that the administration is moving to carry out Trump\u2019s orders, DHS has asked the Pentagon to provide up to 8,000 family detention beds at two sites, an administration official confirmed to The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nThe president and his Republican allies have expressed confidence that Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration message will motivate his conservative base as Republicans try to maintain control of Congress. Democrats have accused the president of fanning public fears over a group of migrant families that has dwindled and remains 800 miles from the United States.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s speech was a political stunt aimed at whipping up fear and xenophobia just days before the election,\u201d Rep.

In many cases, you have young men, strong men,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut the Mexican forces were federal police, not military, and there were no reports of serious injuries. Asked if the U.S. military would use lethal force, Trump suggested that the troops would be compelled to respond to violent confrontations.\n\n\u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to consider \u2014 and I told them consider it a rifle.\u201d\n\nA Pentagon spokesman declined to specify how members of the military would react under the scenario laid out by Trump.\n\n\u201cWe will not discuss hypothetical situations or specific measures within our rules on the use of force, but our forces are trained professionals who always have the inherent right of self-defense,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Pentagon. \u201cI would also emphasize that our forces are in support of DHS/CBP, who are performing law enforcement activities.\u201d\n\nNews of Trump\u2019s comments had reached the caravan by Thursday night in Matias Romero Avendano in Mexico, where the migrants were camped in a soggy sports field on the edge of town.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t shoot because we\u2019re not criminals,\u201d said Erik Miranda, 39. He said he had lived in the United States for 15 years and he\u2019d been deported twice despite asking for asylum. \u201cHow horrible,\u201d said Daniela Carbajal, 27, when told of Trump\u2019s threat. \u201cI\u2019m not justifying throwing rocks but remember: we have children among us.\u201d\n\nUnder the Refugee Act of 1980, migrants who present themselves at U.S. ports of entry or reach American soil and state a fear of persecution in their home countries are entitled to a \u201ccredible fear\u201d screening. That review is typically done by a U.S. asylum officer to determine whether the applicant should be referred to an immigration judge.\n\nIf approved by the asylum officer, applicants are typically released in the United States while waiting for a hearing, which could take a year or longer because immigration courts have a backlog of more than 750,000 cases.\n\nTrump said that large numbers of migrants are being coached by immigration lawyers to make false asylum claims and that more Central American families are making the journey because U.S. law prevents the federal government from detaining children for lengthy periods. The number of Central America families seeking asylum reached record levels this year.\n\nThe process, Trump asserted, \u201cmakes a mockery of our immigration system.\u201d\n\n[The border is tougher than ever to cross. But there\u2019s still one way into America]\n\nLegal analysts cast doubt on the legality of draft plans, circulated within the Trump administration, that would issue blanket denials of asylum to large groups of immigrants, in particular those who do not come to the country through official ports of entry.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t by executive fiat repeal an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment,\u201d said Deborah Anker, a Harvard Law School professor. \u201cHe has to ask for new legislation.\u201d\n\nTrump said the migrants in the caravan are not \u201clegitimate\u201d asylum seekers, arguing the law should not be used to accommodate people fleeing poverty and is intended for those escaping religious and political persecution.\n\nThe administration already has been trying to curtail asylum claims.\n\nIn recent months, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have been turning away thousands of asylum seekers before they can make a claim, telling them to return later, typically citing capacity limits. The practice, known as \u201cmetering,\u201d is being challenged in federal court.\n\nThe caravan, a fluid and loosely organized group, numbered more than 7,000 early last week, according to the United Nations, but more recent estimates by the Mexican government put the figure at about half that. Other, smaller collections of migrants also have been traveling north and attempting to join the main group.\n\nMexican authorities say more than 2,000 migrants have accepted their offer to seek asylum there and remain in southern Mexico.\n\nIf thousands in the caravan do manage to reach the U.S. border and find severe restrictions on their ability to request asylum at legal crossings, it could significantly increase the possibility that they would attempt to swim or float across the Rio Grande, even with thousands of Border Patrol agents and U.S. soldiers waiting for them on the other side, experts warned.\n\nIt is not clear how they would be handled, but Trump has vowed not to release them into the United States while awaiting a court hearing \u2014 even though U.S. courts have limited the government\u2019s ability to hold children in immigration jails for longer than 20 days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting up massive cities of tents,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to release.\u201d\n\nMaria Sacchetti, Seung Min Kim, Paul Sonne and Isaac Stanley-Becker in Washington and Michael Miller in Matias Romero Avendano, Mexico, contributed to this report.", "Sen.

(Michael Mathes/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA leading Republican super PAC has retreated from the airwaves in West Virginia, as GOP hopes of ousting a Democratic senator in the most pro-Trump state of the 2016 election have faded in the final days of the midterm campaign.\n\nAfter spending millions on the air in recent months, the Senate Leadership Fund is no longer airing television advertisements in the race, spokesman Chris Pack confirmed to The Washington Post. The organization, which had invested $7 million since Labor Day, concluded its commercials this week.\n\nThe super PAC, which is aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is making a more modest $150,000 investment in get-out-the-vote efforts and digital advertising this week, Pack said. The group has also been adding money to other, more pressing contests.\n\nWhile the group did not place any reservations for airtime, the choice not to invest in more television ads at the end of the race highlights the GOP\u2019s dwindling confidence in its ability to defeat Sen. Joe Manchin III, a centrist Democrat who has frequently sided with President Trump. Manchin is facing state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R).\n\nThe ad decision comes as both parties make last-minute money moves reflecting their biggest priorities and vulnerabilities in the fight for control of the Senate. Democratic groups are sending reinforcements this week to Minnesota to help Sen. Tina Smith, signaling potential concern in a race that has been under the national radar.\n\nRepublicans are trying to keep and possibly add to their 51-to-49 Senate majority, hoping to capitalize on a favorable map that includes plenty of races in states that Trump won. Polls show tight contests in several battlegrounds that stand to decide which party will control the chamber.\n\nIn addition to West Virginia and Minnesota, strategists in both parties are watching Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nNonpartisan analysts regard Republicans as the favorites to keep control of the Senate. But Republicans are not favored to keep the House, given the many suburban swing districts in play where Trump is unpopular.\n\nTrump won more than 68 percent of the vote in West Virginia \u2014 his largest share in any state \u2014 and he plans to campaign there Friday. Recent public polls show Manchin leading Morrisey by single digits. Republicans have privately voiced some pessimism about the race during the past several weeks, although the \u00adDemocratic-led Senate Majority PAC remains on the air.\n\nManchin was the only Democrat who voted for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Republicans have aggressively pointed to Kava\u00adnaugh\u2019s contentious confirmation fight in an effort to motivate people to vote Republican in the more conservative states.\n\n[Republicans turn Kavanaugh into an election-year rallying cry]\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, meanwhile, started its first ad campaign in the Minnesota race Thursday.

The DSCC is spending about $700,000 in the effort.\n\nThe Senate Majority PAC and Emily\u2019s List, two other Democratic groups, are combining forces for a six-digit investment in digital and mail advertisements in the contest, according to strategists at the organizations.\n\nSmith was appointed to replace Democrat Al Franken, who resigned in January following allegations that he touched women inappropriately.

But they cannot coordinate strategy with candidates.\n\nThe Republican leanings of West Virginia in federal elections initially fueled GOP hopes of picking up the Senate seat there. But a divisive and bruising Republican primary and Manchin\u2019s record \u2014 a former governor, supporter of Trump on the environment and backer of Trump\u2019s two Supreme Court nominees \u2014 have complicated their task.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "Opinion writer\n\nIf President Trump goes through with his plan to send thousands of troops to the border, a move that appears solely designed to hype the Central American migrants into a national emergency and boost GOP chances in the election, the decision will merit serious congressional scrutiny.\n\nAnd if Democrats take back the House, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s going to get.\n\nIn an interview with me, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, confirmed that a Democratic House will hold hearings on the decision in order to compel the administration to justify and explain it.\n\n\u201cWe would ask the Pentagon to come in and explain to us in an open public hearing what they\u2019re doing and why,\u201d Smith, who would take over as committee chair if Democrats won the majority, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should let the president get away with this type of policy with no justification and no explanation for it.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 House Democrats have signed a new letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis demanding a briefing and an explanation of the rationale for the current strategy. The letter, which was sent my way, says:\n\nThe President has exploited the caravan of people traveling to the U.S. to seek asylum for his own political gain, and he continues to politicize and militarize this humanitarian crisis as these men, women, and children are fleeing violence and persecution in an unstable part of the world. \u2026 This use of military personnel and resources for functions outside of core mission areas warrants additional Congressional oversight.\n\nThe letter further asks for answers to basic questions about the strategy, such as:\n\nWhat rules of engagement will troops be under with regard to individuals in the caravan or any other individuals approaching or coming across the southern border? Have any troops been instructed or trained on how to interact or engage in any way with individuals in the caravan? If so, what is the nature of the expected interaction and what training have these troops received for these interactions? How much will this deployment cost the American taxpayer?\n\nObviously, with Democrats in the minority, they cannot force these issues. But this letter should be seen as a preview of what oversight would look like on this whole mess if Democrats do take back the House.\n\nTrump is sending these troops to the border for no purpose other than dramatizing his campaign message that only he and Republicans will protect the country from what he is characterizing as a national emergency. His characterization is simply absurd \u2014 these migrants are hundreds of miles from the border, they are dwindling in number, and the caravan is mostly made up of families with children. Trump has conjured up this campaign fiction by resorting to all manner of garish, unconstrained lies. The use of the military as props to sustain that fiction is an extraordinary abuse of the public trust.\n\nBut let\u2019s say I\u2019m wrong about that. One way to determine whether any serious due diligence and deliberations actually did go into this decision is through congressional scrutiny. And this situation is very ripe for it. The administration could be pressed to answer questions about those deliberations. Such hearings, Smith told me, would involve multiple committees of jurisdiction, such as the Homeland Security, Judiciary and Oversight committees.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s very declaration of a national emergency itself deserves scrutiny. Trump declared this emergency in a tweet, without going through the proper legal protocols.

(Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nS\u00e9rgio Moro, a judge who presided over an ongoing corruption crackdown that decimated Brazil\u2019s political establishment and paved the way for Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s victory in last week\u2019s election, on Thursday accepted the post of justice and public security minister in the new administration.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of implementing strong policies against corruption and organized crime, while respecting the constitution, the law and rights, brought me to this decision,\u201d Moro said in a statement.\n\nBut his appointment has sparked an outcry, with critics saying it taints the four-year-old corruption probe as politically motivated.\n\nMoro, 46, became a household name in 2014 for holding Brazil\u2019s rich and powerful accountable for corruption and racketeering. He was the main judge responsible for deciding cases in what has become the largest corruption probe in Brazilian history. Operation Car Wash uncovered a complex kickback scheme wherein large construction companies funneled bribes to top politicians in return for lucrative contracts and favorable legislation.\n\nWhile politicians on both the right and the left were targeted in the investigation, prosecutors argued that former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silvaand the then-ruling Workers\u2019 Party were at the center of the scheme.\n\nLast year, Moro found Lula guilty of corruption and money laundering as part of the investigation. In April, he sent Lula to jail to serve a 12-year sentence after his appeals were denied, a move that plucked him out of a presidential race in which he was the front-runner and cleared a path to the presidency for Bolsonaro, a fringe politician from a tiny party. Lula and many of his supporters called the investigation a politically motivated witch hunt to remove him from the race.\n\nThe scale of corruption uncovered by the investigation fueled public outrage. Thousands took to the streets denouncing the Workers\u2019 Party and calling for a change in leadership. That anger lifted Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign and doomed his rival, Lula stand-in Fernando Haddad.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Bolsonaro had sought to associate himself with Moro, using the judge\u2019s name and image in political ads and vowing to continue his fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cWe agreed on 100 percent, everything. It\u2019s not the Bolsonaro campaign that wins, Brazil wins with a heavyweight on this issue,\u201d Bolsonaro told reporters outside his home on Thursday.\n\n[How far to the right could Brazil\u2019s new leader take the country?]\n\nAs minister of justice and public security, Moro will be entrusted with fixing the two issues that Brazilians most care about: crime and corruption.\n\nYet observers worry that the appointment could undermine the ongoing and sprawling corruption investigation. Moro has stepped away from the probe and will no longer try cases, including the remaining ones involving Lula.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risky move,\u201d said Alexandre Bandeira, a political strategist in Brasilia. \u201cIt can give ammunition to the rumors that Car Wash was a political arrangement to pull Lula from the election.\u201d\n\nFor years, Moro said he would never enter politics and presented himself as being above the political fray. \u201cI am a man of justice, and, no offense, I am not a man of politics,\u201d he said in a 2016 interview. \u201cI am of another reality, another career track, another profile. That risk will never exist.\u201d\n\nLula\u2019s allies denounced Moro\u2019s appointment as proof that the corruption investigation has unfairly targeted the former president.\n\n\u201cFraud of the century!\u201d tweeted Gleisi Hoffmann, a senior member of the Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cJudge Sergio Moro will be Minister of Justice in Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s Government, who has only got elected because Lula was unfairly convicted and prevented from participating in the elections . . . by judge Sergio Moro. Helped to elect, helping to govern.\u201d\n\nStill, others welcomed the news that Moro, an expert on corruption and money laundering, would be given a broader platform.\n\n\u201cSergio Moro is a moral asset to Brazil,\u201d a Bolsonaro ally and the governor-elect of Sao Paulo, Jo\u00e3o Doria, said in a statement. \u201cHaving Judge Moro as Minister of Justice and Public Security will make Bolsonaro\u2019s government even more dignified and signal a new path of transparency and honesty in Brazilian politics.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Brazil\u2019s political class came undone\n\nBrazil shed a military dictatorship.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, longtime Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone told The Washington Post that he hasn\u2019t discussed WikiLeaks with anybody from the Trump campaign. Asked about Stephen K. Bannon being asked by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigators about such contacts, Stone was clear in his denial.\n\n\u201cThere are no such communications,\u201d Stone said, \u201cand if Bannon says there are, he would be dissembling.\u201d\n\nThat denial has already fallen apart.\n\nThe New York Times reported Thursday that Stone emailed with Bannon about WikiLeaks just days before it first started releasing Russia\u2019s hacked Hillary Clinton emails. After WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed publicly to have documents related to the U.S. presidential race, Bannon reportedly emailed Stone on Oct. 4: \u201cWhat was that this morning???\u201d Stone responded: \u201cA load every week going forward.\"\n\nStone told The Post on Thursday that he \u201cwas unaware of this email exchange until it was leaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had not turned it up in our search,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can find no others to campaign officials.\u201d\n\nThe emails don\u2019t necessarily indicate Stone was acting as an intermediary between the campaign and WikiLeaks, which is the central question involving Stone and his role in the broader Russia investigation. Stone was only relaying things Assange had said publicly, after all.\n\nBut they do constitute yet another example of Stone saying things about his Russia-related actions that turn out not to be true. And the list of those things has grown quite long.\n\nWikiLeaks contacts\n\nIn congressional testimony in September 2017, Stone said, \u201cI have never said or written that I had any direct communication with Julian Assange and have always clarified in numerous interviews and speeches that my communication with WikiLeaks was through the aforementioned journalist\u201d \u2014 referring to Randy Credico.\n\nWe later found out that Stone exchanged direct messages on Twitter with the main WikiLeaks account.\n\nRussian contacts\n\nLast year, Stone repeatedly denied contacts with Russians about the 2016 campaign.\n\nWe\u2019ve since found out that he had, in fact, spoken with a Russian national who called himself Henry Greenberg in May 2016, when the man offered Stone information about Clinton. Trump campaign official Michael Caputo had even texted Stone about \u201cthe Russian.\u201d Stone has said he merely forgot about the meeting but had his memory refreshed by Mueller showing Caputo the texts.\n\nBeing identified in Mueller documents\n\nIn July, Stone initially claimed he didn\u2019t think he was the unnamed person identified in an indictment from the special counsel as having interacted with the allegedly Russia-affiliated hacker Guccifer 2.0 in 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is me, because I wasn\u2019t in regular contact with members of the Trump campaign,\u201d Stone said.\n\nMere hours later, he admitted it probably was him \u2014 and it turned out he had actually posted the communications to his own website in early 2017.\n\nHis sources\n\nStone at one point claimed Credico was his only source about WikiLeaks, then he later said he was his principal source. Now he has amended that to include emails he had seen.\n\nStone has said he was merely referring to public reports about Assange\u2019s plans and information he got from Credico, a liberal New York radio host who interviewed Assange on his show. Credico has repeatedly denied passing any information from WikiLeaks to Stone. Stone recently added to his account, saying he had also been tipped about a possible coming WikiLeaks disclosure by viewing an email from James Rosen, then a Fox News reporter, to blogger Charles Ortel. Ortel confirmed to The Post that he had forwarded Stone the email, in which Rosen said he was hearing a major disclosure related to Clinton was in the offing. Rosen declined to comment.\n\nCampaign contacts\n\nIn the most recent contradiction, Bannon\u2019s emails actually aren\u2019t the only things calling Stone\u2019s version into question. According to the New York Times\u2019s reporting, Bannon and two campaign officials have told investigators that Stone sought to build himself up as an authority on WikiLeaks:\n\nOne of them told investigators that Mr. Stone not only seemed to predict WikiLeaks\u2019s actions, but that he also took credit afterward for the timing of its disclosures that damaged Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\n\nIt would seem difficult for Stone to do that if he wasn\u2019t actually communicating with the campaign about WikiLeaks.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t damning legally. But it does suggest Stone hasn\u2019t been truthful about exactly what happened \u2014 repeatedly.", "", "\n\nIt's getting colorful out there!

(Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump regularly attacks his Democratic foes, and one who is increasingly drawing his attention is Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who hopes to be the next governor of Florida.\n\nTrump, who campaigned on the promise of being a voice for the forgotten people against the elites, tweeted that the Ivy League education of Ron DeSantis, the Republican candidate for Florida governor, was among the factors that make him a better choice than Gillum, who attended one of Florida\u2019s historically black universities.\n\nIn Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2018\n\nThe part of the tweet that made the most news was Trump calling Gillum a thief. Some thought Trump\u2019s attack was racist, given his history of associating black men with criminal activity. But Gillum stopped short of lobbing the accusation himself.\n\n\u201cI have not called the president a racist, but there are racists in his sympathizers who believe he may be, which is why they go to his aid, which is why he has provided them cover. I believe his cover has led to much of the degradation in our political discourse,\u201d Gillum said Thursday on CNN.\n\nWhile campaigning in Florida on Wednesday, Trump continued the jabs, calling Gillum \u201ca failed mayor,\u201d blaming him for Tallahassee\u2019s crime rate and attempting to pit Gillum against police:\n\nAndrew Gillum wants to throw open your borders to drug dealers, human traffickers, gang members and criminal aliens. And Gillum supports deadly sanctuary cities. He wants to abolish ICE and he signed an extreme, left-wing pledge that supported an end to all borders.... Andrew Gillum is too extreme for the people of Florida.... And he\u2019s also weak on crime. On Andrew Gillum\u2019s watch, there were more murders last year ... than any year in the history of Tallahassee. And Gillum is weak on corruption. Tallahassee is among the most corrupt cities anywhere in the United States. Is this really what you want in the state of Florida?\n\nThe line of attack associating Gillum with illegal immigration seems meant to instill fear in Trump\u2019s base but also to sway the independent Florida voters that swung to Trump. Enthusiasm for Gillum is high among Democrats headed into the midterm elections, which require Trump to rely on his most effective motivator: fearmongering.\n\nAnother high-profile Democrat, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.), has launched a Senate campaign in a southern red state that aims to be inclusive and has garnered national attention. But unlike O\u2019Rourke, Gillum consistently leads his opponent in the polls.\n\nGillum is one of the Democrats running who is viewed as a successor to former president Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, and Obama\u2019s visit Friday to Miami to campaign for Gillum seems to confirm that. A Gillum win would be a coup for Democrats in a state that went for Trump\n\nSo while the president is leaning heavily on fear to rally votes, it could be that it partly stems from what he is dealing with himself. Trump seeks to put \u201cyes men\u201d in positions of influence across the country. And DeSantis has signaled that he could be that. The president noticed him during the GOP gubernatorial primary when the former congressman appeared on Fox News frequently to defend the president. While Trump did not know much about him, DeSantis\u2019s support for Trumpism, which he communicated clearly in one of the most pro-Trump ads of the midterms, was more than enough for him to win the president\u2019s praise.\n\nIt is clear, perhaps obvious, to Trump that Gillum could do great harm to Trump\u2019s agenda in Florida, an important stronghold in the South. If, in the midterms, the president loses those Florida independents who voted for him, he might not get them back in 2020. And if this goes beyond Florida, Gillum could be a leader in the region\u2019s rejection of Trumpism in favor of a worldview that includes many of the people Trump appears to want to exclude.", "Arron Banks, pictured at Old Down Estate in Bristol in June, said he welcomes the investigation by Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency.

I couldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t do that,\u201d responded Trump.\n\n\u201cYou won!\u201d retorted VandeHei, who must be commended for that flourish.\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump and Axios touched off a helpful self-disclosure on Thursday morning on the set of \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d After co-host Steve Doocy explained the spat, fellow co-host Ainsley Earhardt riffed:\n\nHow frustrating would it be if you\u2019re the president of the United States and every single time you turn on the TV on most of the channels, they\u2019re misconstruing what you say? And you know your heart and you know your words and you know your voice, and then you watch other people report on what you say and it\u2019s completely different than what you mean. That has to be frustrating. That\u2019s why he\u2019s saying it\u2019s fake news. And he\u2019s saying, if you don\u2019t want to be called the enemy, then get the story right, be accurate and report the story the way that I want it reported.\n\nTo unpack all the depravity in those lines would require a book. But we\u2019ll try to keep this brief:\n\n\u201cHow frustrating would it be if you\u2019re the president of the United States and every single time you turn on the TV on most of the channels, they\u2019re misconstruing what you say?\u201d\n\nMisconstruing? Trump is a contender for least-misconstrued politician in U.S. history. There\u2019s rarely any room for interpretation. As his supporters love to highlight, this is a man who speaks his mind.\n\n\u201cAnd you know your heart and you know your words and you know your voice, and then you watch other people report on what you say and it\u2019s completely different than what you mean. That has to be frustrating.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an argument for totalitarianism: Media organizations, by this standard, are supposed to divine the benevolent intentions of Dear Leader, not the actual words that he speaks. Again: In Trump\u2019s case, he doesn\u2019t leave much to chance.\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s saying, if you don\u2019t want to be called the enemy, then get the story right, be accurate and report the story the way that I want it reported.\u201d\n\nYes, \u201creport the story the way I want it reported\u201d is what Trump is saying. He wants the national press to do what the New York press once did for him: repeat his talking points, portray him as a rich stud, disseminate his business propaganda. At least one big-time news outlet is willing to do likewise \u2014 with occasional exceptions \u2014 for Trump the president.\n\nIn a recent Elle profile, Earhardt professed her good intentions. \u201cAll I really worry about is my little world,\u201d she said. \u201cI do want everyone to be happy and safe.\u201d Odd priorities for someone so accommodating of Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\nRead more:\n\nCNN correctly calls Trump\u2019s new immigration-fear ad \u2018racist\u2019\n\n\u2018He baits them\u2019: Jon Stewart says Trump appeals to media\u2019s \u2018narcissism\u2019\n\nShepard Smith can\u2019t redeem Fox News\n\nPresident Trump has fact-checkers gasping for air\n\nAuthor withdraws from Fox News podcast, citing network\u2019s \u2018demagoguery\u2019", "Columnist\n\nAt the end, after the adults impersonating leaders had failed them, after their university had decided to let Jordan McNair\u2019s death be in vain, several Maryland football players refused to accept inaction. They refused to accept a shoddy investigative process, refused to accept the tragedy as merely a mishap when playing big-time football, and refused to accept they were powerless, once more, against misguided authority.\n\nAt the end, those players provided the emotion and coherent thought that led to a revolt from students, faculty, frustrated alums and state lawmakers. At the end, their support gave University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh the strength to do what he wanted to do \u2014 what he needed to do \u2014 and shun the forceful recommendation of the university system\u2019s board of regents to reinstate coach DJ Durkin.\n\nDon\u2019t make Loh, who during this debacle announced he will retire in June, into a martyr. He ultimately did the right thing despite being told to do otherwise. But he was able to stand atop public outrage while acting in defiance. The players deserve the appreciation, and the praise shouldn\u2019t be reserved solely for the ones who refused that initial judgment. As a unit, regardless of where they stood on the Durkin issue, these players have represented Maryland well during a devastating period.\n\nThey have honored McNair in a heartfelt manner and assured their waving of a flag bearing his No. 79 isn\u2019t some meaningless act. Through the pain, they have found a way to produce a 5-3 record that includes a victory over Texas. They have taken the best of what Durkin taught them, embraced the style of interim coach Matt Canada and shown how mature and responsible they are on their own. Their performance this season proves that, while every coach needs to motivate and push athletes, it\u2019s important to empower them as well.\n\n[Amid turmoil, Maryland board calls special meeting]\n\nThese are developing adults who don\u2019t need to be scared right. They need to be nudged from time to time. They need structure and discipline, for sure. As reports about some infighting over Durkin indicated, they still have much to learn about resolving conflict, even though confrontation seemed inevitable on a football team of 100 players dealing with a difficult and polarizing issue. But they also need to be encouraged and allowed to take ownership. There\u2019s nothing good that comes out of an avoidable death. But it is reassuring to watch the players, who will be faced with plenty of hardship during their lives, exhibit their resilience, character and sense of mission.\n\nIn response to having their voices heard Wednesday, linebacker Tre Watson wrote on Twitter: \u201cPressure busts pipes doesn\u2019t it??\u201d\n\nOffensive lineman Ellis McKennie, who also played with McNair in high school, quoted the tweet and added: \u201cMost certainly does! Don\u2019t let anyone tell you your voice doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d\n\nMcKennie was one of three players who walked out of Durkin\u2019s first meeting with the team after he had been reinstated. Offensive lineman Brendan Moore and tight end Avery Edwards were the others. Wide receiver Michael Cornwell and linebacker Bruce Miller were some of the other vocal players on Twitter. They made it easier for public disgust over Durkin\u2019s reinstatement to morph into a protest that would have become quite a disturbance leading up to Saturday\u2019s game against Michigan State. When the politicians started chiming in and making threats to scrutinize how the regents arrived at their recommendations, Loh had ample support.\n\nIt\u2019s very appropriate for these times in sports and society that a few Terrapins decided to test the strength of their voices. This is an era of protest in athletics, and even though this issue isn\u2019t tied to the Black Lives Matter movement, we are talking about students who are studying and living at this historical moment. So it\u2019s no surprise that a few college football players, many of whom look at the NFL as the standard, decided to mimic their idols and push back against what they considered an injustice.\n\nHarry Edwards, the sociologist, activist and founder of the Olympic Project for Human Rights that inspired the 1968 protest of Tommie Smith and John Carlos, has said throughout this wave of athlete activism that the college students would be a major part of the next movement. You have seen isolated recent incidents, including the Missouri football team protest three years ago that forced the resignation of the state university system president for failing to act against racist incidents on campus. And on a larger level, the NCAA system is so flawed and exploitative that there\u2019s always the potential for some bold, intelligent student-athletes to take a stand. They just have to recognize their power.\n\n[Maryland remains a long way from being out of the woods]\n\nOn the surface, there\u2019s no connection between a student revolt against the NCAA and the Maryland players against Durkin. But it\u2019s another indicator that college athletes aren\u2019t voiceless.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have numbers,\u201d Edwards said during an interview before the Maryland players acted. \u201cYou have to have acts. You have to have activism. At some point, there\u2019s going to be a national championship football game with $100 [million] or $200 million on the line, and the kids are going to stay in the locker room and say, \u2018We\u2019ll take the field when somebody talks to us about money.\u2019 There\u2019s going to be a Final Four, and no one is going to be at center court for the jump ball because they\u2019re tired of how they\u2019re being treated. It\u2019s inevitable.\n\n\u201cWith college sports and the notion of amateurism, everything they do adds more links to the chains that are binding athletes in servitude. It\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s going to spark a more profound rebellion. Every little empowering moment brings us one step closer to that ultimate moment.\u201d\n\nFor now, at Maryland, the football players will settle for taking back what\u2019s theirs. If the university is serious about permanent reform in the football program, the players\u2019 voices had better continue to be a huge part of the process.\n\nThey may be young and in need of molding, but during a most trying time, we also learned that their minds are fresh, their hearts are beating, and they aren\u2019t as easy to corrupt as some of the people pretending to serve them.\n\nFor more by Jerry Brewer, visit washingtonpost.com/brewer.", "\n\nVoters in Marietta, Ga., waited for up to two hours to cast their ballots Oct. 18. This year, a record number of people in the state have voted early. (Jessica McGowan/Getty Images) (Jessica Mcgowan/Getty Images)\n\nDr. Raphael G. Warnock is chairman of the New Georgia Project and pastor of Atlanta\u2019s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church.\n\nA young woman learned her name was no longer on the voter rolls in Georgia. Ironically, she discovered this while training as a canvasser for new voters. Since registering and casting her first ballot in 2008, she hadn\u2019t returned to the polls, and under the new \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d rule, the system purged her registration.\n\nA dentist in Macon received a letter from the secretary of state, warning him that he was at risk of being labeled an \u201cinactive voter\u201d for changing addresses, not voting or not responding to election-related mail. None of that was true, he said: He\u2019d participated in every Georgia election in the past 40 years and had lived in his home for 30.\n\nA man was moved to a \u201cpending\u201d list of voters and told he had to prove his identity before he could cast a ballot, because the clerk registering him had missed the hyphen in his first name. It took a three-way phone call between him, a team of election lawyers and the Fulton County Board of Elections to secure his status as an eligible voter.\n\nThese individuals called the New Georgia Project, the voter rights group for which I serve as chairman, and we sent in a phalanx of legal experts to defend their rights. But not everyone is so lucky, and these are not rare and random instances of people accidentally falling through the cracks. The system is functioning exactly as it was designed. They\u2019re the consequence of the policies pursued by Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp (who, like a boxer refereeing his own bout, oversees the election in which he\u2019s running).\n\nMy beloved state of Georgia has followed seemingly every strategy in the voter-suppression playbook, like partisan gerrymandering and closing polling locations. It even charged a poll worker with a felony for helping someone use a voting machine. Moreover, the state has pursued aggressive voter purges, removing 1.6 million names from the rolls between the 2012 and 2016 elections, and another 670,000 last year. More than 100,000 of these were due to the new \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d standard. Anyone sincerely concerned with the health of our democracy, whose voter turnout trails most developed countries, would invite citizens into the process, not punish them for being unable to make it to the polls for two seasons.\n\nThe state has also made it harder for new voters to participate, by implementing \u201cexact match,\u201d demanding that voters\u2019 names on the rolls exactly match the state\u2019s driver\u2019s license and Social Security records. This system has put the registrations of nearly 47,000 new voters on hold, 70 percent of them African American. It is extremely error-prone. Discrepancies as small as a missing hyphen, an extra space, or an initial in place of a middle name could put a voter in the crosshairs, making women and people of color particularly vulnerable to having their applications stalled. So are new citizens: The system routinely flags them as \u201cnoncitizens,\u201d because state agency records do not automatically update when they\u2019re naturalized. All \u201cpending\u201d voters may still cast a ballot if they bring adequate evidence of their identity or eligibility to the polls. Even so, there is substantial collateral damage. Such policies depress turnout by sowing confusion, discouraging voters who are unclear about their rights.\n\n[Think your vote doesn't count? Then why are people trying to suppress it?]\n\nWe are witnessing, in broad daylight, an assault on the American covenant, summarized in those simple and sublime words \u201cWe the people.\u201d That\u2019s not just a political problem; it\u2019s a moral problem. It speaks to the integrity of the process and the character of the country. We are in a fight for the soul of our nation\u2019s democracy. If we lose that fight, then everybody loses, Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAt Ebenezer Baptist Church, where I am pastor, we register people virtually every Sunday to vote. Theologically, worship or \u201cliturgy\u201d literally means \u201cthe work of the people,\u201d and that\u2019s what voting is: When we vote, we raise our collective voices. In that sense, voting is an act of worship, a prayer for the kind of country that we want to live in. In a 1957 speech, Martin Luther King Jr., co-pastor of Ebenezer Baptist, also spoke of the vote in sacred terms. With the preacher\u2019s refrain, he intoned: Give us the ballot. \u201cGive us the ballot,\u201d he said, and the people would elect leaders \u201cwho have felt not only the tang of the human, but the glow of the Divine.\u201d\n\nIn America, we have noisy, contentious and sometimes rambunctious arguments about public policy and taxes, about bread, butter and guns. Those who seek to win the argument or enter public office must first convince the people. In this process, the people \u2014 all of the people \u2014 get to speak. That is the covenant we have with one another.\n\nAs told to Washington Post editor Sophia Nguyen.", "", "Days before the midterm elections, President Trump said Wednesday that as many as 15,000 U.S. troops could be mobilized to \u201charden\u201d the U.S. border against a caravan of mostly Honduran asylum seekers.\n\n\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nThe closest caravan of people is as many as two months from reaching the Rio Grande, though some Republicans are seeking to portray the migrants as an immediate and existential threat. Trump has called it an \u201cinvasion\u201d force.\n\nA reporter Wednesday asked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis if the mobilization was a stunt to stoke Trump\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cThe support that we provide to the secretary for homeland security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police, so we don\u2019t do stunts in this department,\u201d Mattis said.

The orchestrated public affairs event came as the Pentagon was challenged to articulate the future of the U.S. military\u2019s relationship with the country following Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s apparent murder at the hands of Saudi officials.\n\nThe United States provides arms, intelligence and refueling and other logistical support to the Saudi military for its war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led bombing campaign has helped drive a widespread famine and led to the deaths of thousands of civilians.\n\nMattis has since said the killing threatened to destabilize Middle East relations but has not indicated whether there will be changes to the U.S.-Saudi military alliance, although he has called for an end to the war in Yemen.\n\nPat Tillman: Family said military told \u2018lies\u2019 to turn dead soldier into a symbol\n\n\n\nPat Tillman, shown here as a student at Arizona State University, joined the Army instead of continuing his steller NFL career, forgoing millions.

It took five weeks for the Pentagon to acknowledge to his family that he was killed by a fellow soldier, not an enemy combatant.\n\nTillman turned down millions in contracts to enlist following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and became a walking public recruiting tool, hailed by Congress and the Pentagon \u201cas an example of combat bravery,\u201d The Post reported after his death. President George W. Bush publicly described him as a hero.\n\nHis family later accused the military of warping Tillman\u2019s life and death.

Krakauer said Tillman\u2019s death was also used to distract from such problems as the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal and an insurgency spinning out of control in Iraq.\n\nIn 2007, the Pentagon\u2019s independent watchdog agency said the Army was at fault for how it reported Tillman\u2019s death. \u201cOur failure in fulfilling this duty brought discredit to the Army and compounded the grief suffered by the Tillman family,\u201d the Army\u2019s acting secretary, Peter Geren, said at the time.\n\nGiant flags, welcome home moments and somber tributes \u2014 with few clear outcomes\n\n\n\nA Marine holds a giant flag as the national anthem is played before a game between the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia in 2013.

But this year saw the most aviation-related deaths in the military since 2013, with pilots struggling to overcome past budget cuts, fewer hours of flight time and growing maintenance backlogs.\n\nThat raises the question of whether the public relations opportunities afforded by flight demonstrations at sporting events are worth balancing against costs and safety risks, especially as the Army failed to meet its recruiting targets last year.\n\nRead more:\n\nMigrant caravan: U.S. troops at the border will be armed.

Showers may break out ahead of it early Friday in the Washington region, but its main push is expected Friday evening when heavy rain and storms are possible.\n\nSome areas could receive well over an inch of rain, but amounts are likely to vary widely.\n\nBased on the latest information, rain is most likely between 4 and 11 p.m. and could coincide with the Friday commute home. However, it\u2019s still not clear whether the heavy rain will be widespread or if it will come through in narrow bands, drenching some areas while just skirting others.\n\nWhere the heaviest rain occurs, some pockets of flooding are possible. But widespread problems are unlikely since rainfall over the last 30 days has been somewhat lower than normal, despite the very wet conditions prior.\n\nThe rain is expected to end by early Saturday morning, paving the way for a mostly dry weekend.\n\nAs the cold front running into the region Friday will be colliding with warm, muggy air, we cannot rule out some embedded thunderstorms in the rain bands passing through.\n\nThe National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has placed our region in its marginal risk zone for severe storms.

Things have changed, to say the very least.\n\nNow the painfully protracted, often overwritten, covertly Shakespearean melodrama comes to an end, at last, with the release of Season 6 on Friday, while the rest of us keep shuffling toward the end of the world. Besides noting \u201cHouse of Cards\u2019s\u201d role in the streaming-TV revolution, there\u2019s not much left to say about it, besides good riddance to its perpetual notion that Washington only works when Washington is cruel.\n\nEven with the topically on-point crisis \u2014 some would say gift \u2014 of having to fire its star, Kevin Spacey (amid allegations of sexual assault), and replace him with the show\u2019s far more interesting co-star and character (Robin Wright as the newly sworn-in, stainless-steel President Claire Underwood), \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d had already drifted hopelessly away from any kind of resonance or plausibility. Even as a hate-watch it had stopped delivering.\n\nThe show (created by Beau Willimon; adapted from an old British miniseries) always felt more like a stagy battle reenactment in which the most duplicitous and elaborate scheme wins, with extra points for the character who delivers the fanciest dialogue.\n\nThat turns out to be Claire, whose ascent to the Oval Office was determined in Season 5 before the Spacey matter. Now, as a widow, she finds herself beset by a laughably long list of Cabinet members, archrivals and nemeses all clamoring to bring her down. The attacks are relentless in both their opportunism and c-word-laced sexism, the latter of which \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d now touts as its farewell theme. When a potential assassin\u2019s bullet chips the window of her armored limo, the president quips that it\u2019s the first sign of real respect she\u2019s had during her first 100 days in office.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Claire says, on the first chance she gets to face the camera and speak to the viewers directly \u2014 a cringey narrative device that was irritating when Spacey\u2019s Frank Underwood did it, and is only slightly less so now. \u201cWhatever Frank told you the last five years \u2014 don\u2019t believe a word of it. . . . It\u2019s going to be different for you and me. I\u2019m going to tell you the truth.\u201d\n\nThe truth would be nice; so would a list of all of Season 6\u2019s references to the many schemes currently afloat in President Underwood\u2019s Washington, both now and in past seasons, for those of us who bowed out a few seasons ago. \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d has become far too tangled to sensibly follow.\n\n\n\nRobin Wright, Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear in season 6 of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d (David Giesbrecht/Netflix)\n\nFans of the show savored \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d because of its unhinged portrayal of backstage politics, but the show was hardly ever politically relevant or even competent \u2014 not five years ago and certainly not now. It was mostly about needless cruelty, proving that not only democracy dies at this level of darkness; so do TV shows.\n\nTo believe in \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d you had to buy into its puppet-master theory of government, which holds that one Machiavellian public servant can, through layers of never-ending blackmail, string-pulling and other displays of influence, gain control of so many people that he could determine the course of anything that happens in Washington. Nothing was too low or despicable for the show\u2019s characters \u2014 not even murder. Lacking the self-awareness of the equally shady and corrupt Washington of, say, \u201cScandal,\u201d \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d fetishized its characters\u2019 dark sides to a sadistic degree. And for what? The story got wider, but never deeper.\n\nWhile \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d entertained the fantasy of hyper-capable control, the real world was getting a whole other lesson in the politics of chaos, courtesy of a far more fascinating drama seen in the rise of President Trump, who will choose chaos over a game plan every day. Plans, schemes, endgames \u2014 who has any use for those? The crazier Washington became, the more \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d lost its touch.\n\nStill, Wright\u2019s performance is a rock-solid study in resolve, and the new season throws a few clever and pleasingly feminist elbows with its newfound perspective. Diane Lane joins the cast as Annette Shepherd, girlhood chum and lifelong frenemey to Claire. Annette is also the sister of Bill Shepherd (Greg Kinnear), a powerful industrial scion in the Koch brothers mold, who is livid at Claire for having second thoughts about signing some kind of environmentally ruinous bill that he\u2019s wormed through Congress.\n\nBoth Lane and Kinnear seem eager to show off their squinty-eyed skills at playing caustically opportunistic demons, and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is only too happy to provide scenery for them to snack on. That was the method Spacey chose to express the show\u2019s tone \u2014 there can be no overacting here, so long as an elegant iciness prevails. Casting for maximum creepiness has never been a problem in this regard, as veterans such as Campbell Scott and Patricia Clarkson demonstrate, by making easy work of their snaky roles.

Under Mexican law, five such decisions set a binding precedent nationally.\n\n\u201cThis 5th judgement means that, while the cannabis prohibition law nominally remains in place for now (and arrests remain possible), all judges nationally are now bound by the Supreme Court judgement as a defense in the (now much less likely) scenario of prosecutions being brought,\u201d according to Transform, a think tank that was part of the effort to overturn the ban. \u201cThe legalisation of cannabis for adult personal use, possession, private cultivation and sharing is therefore currently de facto (in practical effect), rather than de jure (formalised in law/legislation).\u201d\n\nIn a news release translated by Transform, the court said that \u201cthe fundamental right to the free development of the personality allows the persons of legal age to decide \u2014 without any interference \u2014 what kind of recreational activities they wish to carry out and protect all the actions necessary to materialize that choice.\"\n\nThe right to the free development of the personality is a concept from the country\u2019s constitution, amounting to something like a right to self-determination. As in previous cases, the court ruled this week that preventing individuals from using the drug violates their individual autonomy, particularly because marijuana use does not present enough risk to users or to others to justify keeping it outlawed. \u201cThe effects caused by marijuana do not justify an absolute prohibition on its consumption,\u201d the court said.\n\nThe Mexican Congress now has 90 days to rewrite the nation\u2019s drug laws to comply with the rulings, \u201cat which point the reform will assume de jure status,\u201d according to Transform. It remains unclear what Congress will do in response to the ruling. While it could set up a system involving taxation and commercial sales, it could also adopt a more limited approach that would make marijuana possession and use legal but not sales. That\u2019s similar to the regulatory situation in Vermont and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe ruling in Mexico means that there is now a continuous line of legalization jurisdictions along the western coast of North America, running from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Tropic of Cancer.

No more having to switch your working from home day, reschedule meetings, visit a locker, drive to a post office or contact a courier all because of a missed delivery.\u201d\n\n[The next time you order food, this cute robot might roll up to deliver it.]\n\nThe package delivery service is not available to everyone just yet. The company said it\u2019s rolling out the service in Milton Keynes, England, and will expand to the San Francisco Bay area in the next few months.\n\nThe company has already been doing food delivery with a fleet of about 20 robots in Milton Keynes, according to the Telegraph.\n\nThe wheeled robots have a top speed of 4 mph and can detect obstacles from as far as 30 feet away.\n\n\u201cThe robot can operate through just about anything,\u201d Nick Handrick, head of operations for Starship\u2019s D.C. office, told The Washington Post\u2019s Maura Judkis last year. \u201cIf you had something in the way \u2014 a stick, a curb \u2014 it\u2019s able to climb curbs.\u201d\n\nBy giving customers control of when deliveries occur, Starship Technologies is pitching its service as a way to combat package theft. In its announcement, the company cited statistics from a Wakefield Research Poll for Comcast last year that found that 3 in 10 Americans who live in houses or townhouses have had packages stolen. The same poll found that 53 percent of Americans know someone who has been a victim of package theft.\n\nTo sign up for the service, which costs a little more than $10 per month, customers need to download the company\u2019s app. Customers then create a \u201cStarship Delivery Address,\u201d a unique address inside a Starship facility, instead of a residence, where they can have packages sent from places such as Amazon.com. Once a package is delivered to the Starship address, customers receive a text notification that allows them to schedule a home delivery via robot.\n\n(Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe robots are opened by customers via a mobile phone code.\n\nStarship Technologies was founded in Estonia in 2014 by two Skype founders. The company\u2019s robots present an alternative vision of the future of package delivery by companies such as Amazon, UPS and Google, which are betting on drone delivery from above. Each company is looking for a cheaper solution to the \u201clast mile\u201d delivery problem \u2014 a product\u2019s final path from warehouses to residents \u2014 which accounts for just over half of delivery costs, according to a report this year from Business Insider. But before drone companies take off, companies must unravel a complex web of regulations that now make drone delivery untenable.\n\nBarriers exist for robotic ground delivery as well, with many states requiring that humans be in control of delivery robots. Those regulations are beginning to loosen in some states, and haven\u2019t stopped Starship Technologies from amassing experience on streets around the globe ahead of the company\u2019s latest launch.\n\nThe company says its robots have covered more than 125,000 miles in more than 100 cities in 20 countries.", "Turkey\u2019s justice minister warned Saudi officials Thursday that those responsible for Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death must be held responsible, amid growing frustration among Turkish officials over what they say is Saudi Arabia\u2019s refusal to help investigate the journalist\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cNo one can avoid responsibility. . . . It is not an issue that can be covered up,\u201d Abdulhamit Gul told reporters in the Turkish capital, Ankara. \u201cWe expect the Saudi authorities to engage in close cooperation on this issue,\u201d he said, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.\n\nHis remarks came one day after Saudi Arabia\u2019s chief prosecutor, Saud al-Mojeb, departed Istanbul after a three-day visit in which he held at least two meetings with his Turkish counterpart. That visit, Turkish officials said, has been a source of frustration for Turkish investigators probing the death of Khashoggi, who was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month.\n\nTurkey\u2019s public prosecutor, exasperated by Mojeb\u2019s refusal to answer questions, prepared a last-minute statement Wednesday detailing how Khashoggi was killed, officials said. This revealed for the first time that he was strangled almost immediately after he entered the consulate.\n\nIn the statement, the Turkish prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said the Saudi visit produced \u201cno concrete results.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was to let the world know that there had been no cooperation, no collaboration\u201d on the part of the Saudi delegation, a senior Turkish official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations over the statement.\n\nThe Saudi prosecutor, the official said, \u201cdid not come to share what evidence they have. So it created a lack of trust.\u201d\n\nSaudi officials have refrained from commenting on the talks between the Saudi prosecutor and Turkish officials.\n\nKhashoggi, 59, was once close to the Saudi royal family but fell out of favor with the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Khashoggi fled Saudi Arabia last year and was living in exile in the United States, where he wrote for The Washington Post\u2019s Global Opinions section.\n\nHe traveled to Turkey last month to obtain paperwork in preparation for his marriage to Hatice Cengiz, his Turkish fiancee, and was last seen entering the consulate Oct. 2.\n\nFor weeks, Saudi officials denied any knowledge of Khashoggi\u2019s whereabouts but eventually acknowledged that he was killed by a team of Saudi agents, who flew to Turkey earlier that day.\n\nTurkey\u2019s prosecutor asked his Saudi counterpart key questions about the killing \u201cbut did not receive a reply,\u201d said Gul. \u201cWe expect these questions to be answered as soon as possible,\u201d he said, adding that Turkey would \u201cdeepen\u201d its investigation if Saudi officials failed to adequately respond.\n\nTurkish officials had wanted the Saudi delegation to reveal the location of Khashoggi\u2019s body, identify what Saudi officials said was a \u201clocal collaborator\u201d who disposed of the remains and reveal who ordered the killing. At the very least, the Turkish official said, Fidan expected the Saudi prosecutor to provide statements from the suspects. Saudi authorities last month said they had arrested 18 people for their alleged involvement Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nBut, the official said, the Saudi delegation \u201cdidn\u2019t share anything that wasn\u2019t already known.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis resistance to providing information, it makes it seem like they are trying to protect someone \u2014 someone they want kept out of the investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat irked investigators most, according to the official, was Mojeb\u2019s interest in accessing Khashoggi\u2019s cellphones. \u201cIt seemed that they were looking for his contacts and who he spoke to,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe are afraid that if this information is shared with Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi\u2019s friends would be in danger.\u201d\n\nAccording to Abdulkadir Selvi, a columnist for Turkey\u2019s Hurriyet newspaper who is close to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mojeb also asked repeatedly to listen to an audio that Turkish officials say reveals what transpired inside the consulate. Turkey has played the audio for CIA Director Gina Haspel but has not released it publicly.\n\nTurkey says that the killing of Khashoggi was premeditated and that the investigation could implicate senior Saudi officials in the plot. Turkish investigators have gradually released information, apparently in part to pressure the Saudi leadership to act.\n\nAs part of that strategy, officials released video footage of the suspects \u2014 including an alleged body double dressed in Khashoggi\u2019s clothes \u2014 as evidence of planning.\n\nZeynep Karatas and Louisa Loveluck contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nSaudi crown prince described slain journalist as a dangerous Islamist in call with White House\n\nProsecutor says Khashoggi was strangled and dismembered, but fate of body still a mystery\n\nIn the Saudi countryside, Khashoggi\u2019s death seems remote and royal involvement far-fetched\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nHonduran migrants in a caravan heading to the United States travel through Mexico on Oct. 29, 2018. (Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMedia critic\n\nThe CNN headline regarding a new anti-immigration ad posted on President Trump\u2019s Twitter account doesn\u2019t sit above an opinion piece. It\u2019s a news story, and the byline belongs to Stephen Collinson, who is a reporter for the network who covers the White House and politics. But it\u2019s not every day that such a mainstream news outlet adorns a news story with this sort of headline: \u201cTrump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms.\u201d\n\nThen again, it\u2019s not every day, of course, that a U.S. president promotes such clear-cut racism in pursuit of political gains \u2014 though, to be honest, it has become more routine recently. This particular ad dispenses with whatever restraint Trump may have exercised with his divisive immigration rhetoric. It features footage of Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican citizen who entered the United States illegally more than once and was convicted of killing two law enforcement officers in Northern California. As he received his verdict this year, Bracamontes vowed to \u201ckill more cops soon.\u201d\n\nIn his tweet promoting the video ad, Trump writes, \u201cIt is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now!\u201d As the ad cycles through Bracamontes\u2019s chilling threats in the courtroom, a banner reads, \u201cDEMOCRATS LET HIM INTO OUR COUNTRY.\u201d The focus then switches to footage of a migrant caravan overwhelming fences at a checkpoint, and then to a Fox News clip in which a migrant tells a translator that he plans on seeking a pardon for the \u201cfelony he committed \u2026 attempted murder.\u201d Again, the multitudes splash across the screen, with this banner, \u201cWHO ELSE WOULD DEMOCRATS LET IN?\u201d\n\nSo the CNN headline checks out: The video stigmatizes a large group of people of color as criminals \u2014 killers bent on coming in and killing the law-abiding residents of the United States. It\u2019s another in the long list of shocking-but-not-surprising developments in the Trump presidency. This is Trump\u2019s remarks about Mexico\u2019s \u201crapists\u201d in video format.\n\nMost of the ad\u2019s coverage draws an inescapable parallel with the infamous \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad that ran in the 1988 presidential contest between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis. The New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer summed it up this way:\n\nIts key image was a mug shot of Horton\u2014a scowling black man with a dishevelled Afro. Horton, a convicted murderer, had escaped while on a weekend pass issued by a Massachusetts furlough program. A decade earlier, Dukakis had vetoed a bill that would have forbidden furloughs for murderers. After escaping, Horton raped a white woman and stabbed her fianc\u00e9. [Ad creator Larry] McCarthy knew that showing Horton\u2019s menacing face would make voters feel viscerally that Dukakis was soft on crime.\n\nPolitical guru Lee Atwater, manager of Bush\u2019s campaign, apologized for the politics of Willie Horton: \u201cIn 1988, fighting Dukakis, I said that I \u2018would strip the bark off the little bastard\u2019 and \u2018make Willie Horton his running mate.\u2019 I am sorry for both statements: the first for its naked cruelty, the second because it makes me sound racist, which I am not.\u201d The ad\u2019s impact is a matter of some dispute; what\u2019s not disputed is that the ad was racist.\n\nIf anything, Trump\u2019s Bracamontes ad is worse.\n\nThirty years ago, George H.W. Bush released his infamous fear-mongering, racist ad on Willie Horton.\n\n\n\nThis Trump ad is worse.

Trump has labeled the caravan headed to the Southern border an \u201cinvasion\u201d and sent thousands of troops to deal with it. He\u2019s talked about sending as many as 15,000 troops \u2014 more than the people in the caravan \u2014 and also (rather unseriously) revoking birthright citizenship via executive action.\n\nThe problem? No matter what definition you use for \u201ccrisis,\u201d the current situation on our border struggles to meet it.\n\nLet\u2019s count the ways.\n\n1. Illegal border crossings\n\nData from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show illegal border crossings have risen slightly in recent months and are greater than last year. The administration has repeatedly emphasized this \u2014 reportedly spurred by Trump\u2019s anger about the situation.\n\nBut the number of apprehensions and people deemed inadmissible over the past year \u2014 and even now \u2014 is unremarkable when you compare it to the past five fiscal years. This year is the red line:\n\n\n\nMonthly apprehensions at the Southwest border. (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even the estimates of 50,000 monthly border apprehensions we\u2019ve seen in a few months this year is a fraction of where that number has been for most of this century. And the current number of annual apprehensions is also lower than at any point since about 1970, according to FactCheck.org.\n\n\n\nBorder apprehensions by year. (FactCheck.org)\n\n2. The number of undocumented immigrants\n\nThe numbers above are only for those apprehended at the border. So the logic follows: What about those who aren\u2019t being apprehended? Those are the ones most likely to reside illegally in the United States, after all.\n\nWell, a combination of border apprehensions, deportations and people returning to their countries of their own volition in recent years has actually meant the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has dropped in most recent years. The estimated number dropped from 12.2 million in 2007 to 11.3 million in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n\n\nNumber of undocumented immigrants by year. (Pew Research Center)\n\nSome recent years featured a slight uptick, and we don\u2019t yet have data for 2017 and 2018. But the border-apprehension data above suggest the number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States can\u2019t be rising much, if at all.\n\n3. The recently immigrated\n\nNot only has the number of undocumented immigrants been dropping, but they are increasingly not the newly arriving criminals that Trump warns of. Pew data showed, as of 2014, just 14 percent of them had been in the United States fewer than five years.\n\n\n\nUndocumented immigrants in the United States by length of stay. (Pew Research Center)\n\nIn other words, the undocumented population is increasingly a well-established one which, while not living in the United States legally, aren\u2019t the people supposedly sent by Mexico and Central American governments to unleash crime, rape and other mayhem. Recent arrivals are declining both as a percentage of the undocumented population and in real numbers.\n\n4. Crime\n\nAny undocumented immigrant regardless of longevity, of course, could commit such crimes. But data suggest they don\u2019t \u2014 at least not at the same rates as native-born Americans.\n\nWhile violent gangs such as MS-13 do exist, the violent crime rate for undocumented immigrants is lower than for the population as a whole, as many, including The Post\u2019s Christopher Ingraham, have written.\n\n\n\nCrime rates for undocumented immigrants, relative to legal immigrants and native-born Americans. (Screenshot)\n\nThe data also showed that places with higher percentages of undocumented immigrants tended to have lower crime rates.\n\nIn addition, as The Post\u2019s Philip Bump has written, the percentage of noncitizens in federal prisons has been dropping in recent years, and only about 1 percent of federal prisoners are noncitizens convicted of non-immigration-related offenses.\n\n5. The caravan\n\nOkay, even if you set aside ALL of the above, what about the caravan? Trump has been calling it an \u201cinvasion\u201d of the United States for a while now. He\u2019s even sending thousands of troops to the border, ostensibly to protect the homeland. Regardless of what preceded it, couldn\u2019t that be considered a \u201ccrisis?\u201d\n\nWell, there is very little reason it will be an invasion, even if it aspired to be.\n\nThe first problem is that these people are traveling for weeks from Honduras, at which point it would be very difficult for them to invade anyone. The second is that most of them probably won\u2019t even make it that far, given that caravans like this tend to peter out along a long and arduous journey.\n\nAnd the last reason is that this caravan, like previous ones, is almost definitely intended not to immigrate illegally, but to request asylum. The last time we had one of these earlier this year, 1,500 people started the journey from Southern Mexico, about 400 requested asylum, and just 122 were apprehended trying to cross the border illegally.\n\nThis caravan is bigger, and it may turn out differently, but there\u2019s little reason to believe those troops will truly be needed to repel an \u201cinvasion.\u201d", "\n\nA new North Dakota law requires that voters show identification with street addresses when they go to the polls. But many people living on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation don't have residential addresses. (Blake Nicholson/AP)\n\nJamie Azure is tribal chairman for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians.\n\nWhen North Dakota\u2019s strict new voter-identification law went into effect for the 2016 election, people on the reservation of the Turtle Mountain Band of the Chippewa Indians were bewildered. We used to be able to cast ballots in state, federal and tribal elections without an ID if we signed an affidavit or a poll worker vouched for us. Then the legislature passed a law requiring an ID with a residential address at the polls.\n\nThe state has a voting-eligible population of 580,000, and about 70,000 lack the right kind of ID. The law requires that these IDs have street addresses printed on them and specifically bans using a P.O. Box. This was clearly designed to target Native Americans. Most tribal IDs don\u2019t have this information. In fact, many tribal citizens don\u2019t have residential mailing addresses \u2014 the U.S. Postal Service does not provide residential delivery to their rural communities.\n\nSome of my earliest memories as a kid growing up on the reservation involve going to the post office to pick up mail from our box. I could tell you exactly where I lived \u2014 to get to my grandparents' house, for example, you went halfway to Belcourt Lake and made a left at the church \u2014 but we didn\u2019t have an official street address. Nobody did. Our reservation measures about six by 12 miles and is home to about 19,000 people. Most buildings don\u2019t have numbers, and most streets don\u2019t have signs. Everybody knows everybody. We\u2019re a tightknit community and a sovereign nation. We have our own way of doing things. It seems absurd that we should have to call some county official with no connection to the tribe, hundreds of miles away, and be assigned an address by some arbitrary system, just to exercise our basic rights. After all, when members of our tribe signed up to serve in the military, the armed forces didn\u2019t require that information.\n\n[The government bulldozed my tribe\u2019s sacred burial site. We want an apology.]\n\nMembers of the Turtle Mountain Band were key to fighting North Dakota\u2019s law in the courts. At the same time, our tribal council made contingency plans so that when the Supreme Court declined to intervene to protect our voting rights last month, we sprang into reaction mode. Our tribal motor vehicle department, which issues IDs, had already arranged with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to get access to its database of street addresses so we could print that information on the new cards. (Members of other tribes have not been so fortunate. Some have reported that their county officials have been unavailable, or even issued incorrect addresses.) Through some finagling, we secured a new ID machine for each of our four polling sites on Election Day, to ensure that all eligible citizens can get an ID and vote when they show up. We have also waived the processing fee. For a single mother with three kids, that $15 could buy milk for a week. Our community has a nearly 15 percent poverty rate and a 59 percent unemployment rate. We don\u2019t want people to have to make that choice.\n\nThree generations ago, until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Native Americans didn\u2019t have the right to vote at the federal, state and local levels and still maintain tribal citizenship. This new law is intended to disenfranchise our population and hold us down. Ironically, it may have only served to rally the Turtle Mountain people and tribes across North Dakota. In 2016, our voter turnout was an all-time low. But a month ago, when we first opened the office to distribute free IDs to first-time applicants, hundreds of people showed up. The machine got so hot that it started to melt the cards. Then, at this week\u2019s nonpartisan \u201cStand-N-Vote\u201d rally \u2014 starring actor Mark Ruffalo and musician Billy Ray Cyrus, and with an ID machine at the ready \u2014 close to 1,400 tribal members filled the auditorium of our community college. The energy was electric.\n\nIn 2012, fewer than 3,000 votes decided the U.S. Senate race in North Dakota. The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa has more than 13,000 members who are eligible to vote. Unless we use it now, we may never again have that power to tip the scales. We are doing everything we can to get our citizens access to the vote. Now it\u2019s up to us to exercise it and to protect it fiercely going forward. In the 20th century, the government imposed a numbering system on us with the aim of limiting our political power \u2014 our blood quantum. We won\u2019t let a new one act as a barrier to our vote in this election. The Turtle Mountain Band may be a little speck 10 miles off the Canadian border, but we will make ourselves heard.\n\nAs told to Washington Post editor Sophia Nguyen.", "\n\nFrom left, Rep.

(Tony Dejak/AP)\n\nAlthough a new Washington Post-Schar poll released Thursday found Democrats with the edge among likely voters in battleground races nationwide, there are enough considered toss-ups that Tuesday night could still be a nail-biter.\n\nStill, even with those too-close-to-predict races, Sean Trende, political analyst for RealClearPolitics, told The Fix that there are four tied House races that suggest that it will be a good night for Democrats.\n\nBy this point in the campaign, voters are often decided and the races start to break one way or another. But in four red districts in which Trende expected the Republican candidates to start taking the lead, they haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI would have expected they would start breaking toward the Republicans by now, given their partisan makeup,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought voters were Democrat-curious and would now be reverting back to type, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nSo on Tuesday night, pay careful attention to these four races. If the Democratic candidate wins, then the blue wave may actually be a tsunami.\n\nLet\u2019s break down each one.\n\n1. Maine 2nd Congressional District \u2014 Jared Golden (D) vs. Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R)\n\nThis district, one of the most rural in the country, once was consistently blue. It voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since 1992. It had a Democratic congressman for 10 years, from 1995 to 2015. But in 2016, voters elected Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by 10 points.\n\nThe race is tied 41 to 41, according to RealClearPolitics\u2019s average, and has been around that the entire time. It\u2019s turning out to be one of the most expensive races in the country, too, with outside groups pouring millions into ads.

Stevan Pearce (R), who is running for governor this year, won by 25 points. Yet the race for the congressional seat is statistically tied.\n\nHerrell, a state representative, is very conservative and hasn\u2019t tried to moderate or distance herself from Trump, while Torres Small has campaigned as a centrist and has a campaign ad showing her loading a rifle and hunting, which tells you a lot about the district.\n\n3.

John Kasich (R), has been in Republican hands since 1983. It\u2019s one that Republicans are desperate to hold and one that Democrats think they can flip. The district is solidly red and Trump won it in 2016 by 11 points. Although there has been no polling since the August race, there\u2019s no indication that Balderson has pulled away.\n\n4.

With a few notable exceptions, this year\u2019s top models underperformed last year\u2019s. The new iPhone XS died 21 minutes earlier than last year\u2019s iPhone X. Google\u2019s Pixel 3 lasted nearly an hour and a half less than its Pixel 2.\n\nPhone makers tout all sorts of tricks to boost battery life, including more-efficient processors, low-power modes and artificial intelligence to manage app drain. Yet my results, and tests by other reviewers I spoke with, reveal an open secret in the industry: the lithium-ion batteries in smartphones are hitting an inflection point where they simply can\u2019t keep up.\n\n[iPhone XR review: The best $250 you ever saved on a new phone]\n\n\u201cBatteries improve at a very slow pace, about 5 percent per year,\u201d says Nadim Maluf, the CEO of a Silicon Valley firm called Qnovo that helps optimize batteries. \u201cBut phone power consumption is growing up faster than 5 percent.\u201d\n\nBlame it on the demands of high-resolution screens, more complicated apps and, most of all, our seeming inability to put the darn phone down. Lithium-ion batteries, for all their rechargeable wonder, also have some physical limitations, including capacity that declines over time \u2014 and the risk of explosion if they\u2019re damaged or improperly disposed.\n\nAnd the phone power situation is likely about to get worse. New ultrafast wireless technology called 5G, coming to the U.S. neighborhoods soon, will make even greater demands on our beleaguered batteries.\n\nMy test has limitations. Your experience will depend on how you use your phone, and there are steps you can take to make your phone life stretch.\n\nWe\u2019re not without hope. Two phones that performed well in my tests, Samsung\u2019s Note9 and Apple\u2019s iPhone XR, offer ideas about how to design phones to last longer \u2014 at least until a totally new battery tech comes along.\n\n\n\nThe Post's battery test, seen here in action, makes phones set to equal brightness browse and scroll through the same set of websites until each runs out of juice. (Geoffrey Fowler/San Francisco)\n\nWhy your phone battery dies\n\nMy results made me do a double take, so I called up a squad of other tech journalists also obsessed with testing at CNET, Tom\u2019s Guide and Consumer Reports. \u201cOur overall average battery life is coming down,\u201d says Mark Spoonauer, the editor in chief of Tom\u2019s Guide, who also found the iPhone XS battery died sooner than the iPhone X. Many of the phones with the longest battery life, he adds, are a year old.\n\nBut not all other reviewers have noticed the same declines \u2014 and the differences in our results help shed some light on what\u2019s going on.\n\nLarger phones often last longer, but it\u2019s not as simple as the size of the battery inside. Remember the Blackberry? Those had much smaller batteries than today\u2019s smartphones, but could go days without being charged.\n\nThere\u2019s no perfect battery test. Mine, which I borrowed from an industry group called the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium, particularly stresses the screen.\n\nI use a light meter to set all the phones at the same brightness and then force their web browsers to reload and scroll through a series of sites I serve through a local WiFi network. I rerun the tests as many times as possible, and then average the results.\n\nCNET, which like me found conspicuous dips in battery life between the iPhone 8 and iPhone X (and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 and S9), tests screens at 50 percent brightness playing a looping video with Airplane Mode turned on.\n\nWhat we both discovered: phones with fancy screens that are especially high-resolution or use tech such as OLED perform worse. (That tech can require more power to push out light.) So if you want your phone to last longer, turn down the screen\u2019s brightness. Or stop looking at your phone so many times each day, if you can break our nationwide spell of phone addiction.\n\nTom\u2019s Guide throws another factor into the mix: the cellular connection. It makes phones run through a series of websites streamed over LTE. Unlike me, it also saw a big battery life hit to the Pixel 3 XL versus the Pixel 2 XL.\n\nAnother lesson: If you want the battery to last longer, use WiFi when possible \u2014 or even Airplane Mode when you don\u2019t need to be reachable. Both Apple and Android phones also offer low-power modes (not reflected in our testing) that reduce some draining data functions without taking you offline.\n\nThe counterexample is Consumer Reports, which found the new iPhone XS lasted 25 percent longer than last year\u2019s iPhone X. Its test uses a finger robot \u2014 yes, you read that right \u2014 to make phones cycle through lots of different functions and apps, including pauses in use where the screen turns off.\n\nConsumer Reports is likely better testing the phone\u2019s processor, an area where a number of companies \u2014 but particularly Apple \u2014 have made efficiency gains.\n\nSo overall, are battery lives decreasing or increasing? \u201cYou can\u2019t make a straight trend,\u201d says Consumer Reports director of electronics testing Maria Rerecich.\n\nI wish companies had more standardized ways to talk about battery life. Since the earliest days of the iPhone, Apple has described battery life through specific measures, including \u201ctalk time\u201d and \u201cInternet use.\u201d Recently it\u2019s also taken on some more squishy language: The iPhone XS \u201clasts up to 30 minutes longer than iPhone X,\u201d it says, a measure based on data about how long people go before plugging back in.\n\n\n\nConsumer Reports tests phone battery life with this robotic finger, programmed to put the phone through a range of tasks designed to simulate an average day. (Consumer Reports)\n\nHow phones are dealing\n\nSo what about the two 2018 phones that did better in my tests?\n\nSamsung\u2019s Note9 succeeds by stuffing in more battery. It contains a battery capacity of 4,000 mAh, up from the already-huge 3,300 mAh in the Note8. (The iPhone XS battery is only 2,659 mAh, and actually slightly downgraded from the X.)\n\nLots of phones have followed the bigger battery trend. iFixit, a repair community that performs teardown analysis of phone components, says battery capacities have almost doubled in the last five years.\n\nHow much further can the size game go? Huawei just introduced a phone called Mate 20 Pro, not sold in the U.S., with a 4,200 mAh battery. Larger, denser batteries can be more dangerous (remember Samsung\u2019s exploding Note7?), not to mention heavier. The Note9, which also has a giant screen and a stylus, weighs 7.1 oz \u2014 more than twice a deck of cards.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone XR, the new phone I recommend to most people, has a different approach. It scales back on the screen tech \u2014 lower resolution, less bright and lower-quality color \u2014 in ways that benefit battery life tremendously: The XR lasted 3 hours longer than the top iPhone XS, even though the its screen is actually a smidge larger. (Bonus: It also costs $250 less.)\n\n\u201cConsumers have to start getting ready for compromise,\u201d says Maluf, the CEO of the battery optimization company.\n\nPerhaps the market will fragment further, making phones more like buying cars. That market was eventually upended by fuel-economy models; instead of the gas-guzzling Cadillac, you could choose the Honda. Apple\u2019s iPhone XR is the Civic of smartphones.\n\nOur near-future choices are likely either: Get an economy phone \u2014 or plug in more often. Faster and more convenient charging is the strategy for some makers. Lots of phones now support wireless charging, though still few cafes, offices and airport lounges offer it.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the plug itself. Apple, which has shipped the same 5 watt charging brick for years, could take a lesson from Google, which sells its Pixel phones with an 18 watt charger and claims you can get 7 hours of use from just 15 minutes of charging. The one thing that\u2019s almost as bad as running out of juice is being tethered to an outlet.\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis from Geoffrey A.

Panicked Republicans realize that they have tied themselves to the mast of a sinking ship. Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report writes:\n\nEvery midterm is about the sitting president, even ones who are more traditional and less unorthodox than the one currently sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The better a president\u2019s approval ratings, the better his party does in the midterms. The weaker his ratings, the more losses his party suffers. This president has always wanted the election to be about him. And, in these final hours he\u2019s made sure to put the focus back on himself. He\u2019s ramped up the rhetoric on illegal immigration, ordered the military to the southern border and floated the idea about doing away with birthright citizenship with an executive order.\n\nOn a daily basis, President Trump is infuriating all but his narrow base, descending into the depths of racism and reminding voters why it would not be a good idea to give him a free hand. He has once more focused all attention on himself. \u201cWhat is worrying Republicans today, is that in this last week before the election the spotlight has moved from Trump\u2019s strengths (he fulfilled his promises and got another conservative on the Supreme Court), to his biggest weaknesses (his temperament, his over-heated rhetoric and undisciplined tweeting),\u201d Walter says. \u201cGOP strategists have told us that they are seeing slippage in Trump\u2019s approval rating similar to the drop we saw this week in Gallup\u2019s tracker (Trump dropped from 44 percent to 40 percent). This is why many of them are more worried about big losses in the House than they were just a week or ten days ago.\u201d\n\nIt sure doesn\u2019t help when Trump is publicly scolding House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) for popping his unconstitutional trial balloon to repeal birthright citizenship by executive order, nor does it help when the House Republican campaign committee is denouncing Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) gives him a pep talk over the phone.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic enthusiasm is sky-high. Gallup reports:\n\nIn a departure from Republicans\u2019 usual lead on midterm turnout indicators, Democrats appear to be on par with or possibly ahead of Republicans in eagerness and intent to vote this year. Three-quarters of both party groups, 74%, say they are \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d they will vote on or before Election Day. Republicans and Democrats are also about equally likely to report feeling \u201cmore enthusiastic than usual\u201d about voting. At the same time, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say they have given \u201cquite a lot of thought\u201d to the election.\n\nIf \u201cquite a lot of thought\u201d means time fuming about how to put a stop to the descent into pure nativism, that sounds about right.\n\nFor all these reasons, as well as a big advantage in money and strong candidate recruitment, Walter\u2019s colleague Dave Wasserman tweets:\n\nNew: based on the past week\u2019s evidence, we\u2019re revising our House outlook to a Dem gain of 30-40 seats (was 25-35 last month) at @CookPolitical.

He said Thursday in a phone interview that Hnida had an adverse reaction that caused her kidneys and liver to start shutting down and her bone marrow to stop functioning properly.\n\nAfter weeks of treatment, including emergency dialysis, Hnida is stable and expected to recover in the coming months, though her father called her prognosis \u201ccautious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a fairly stunning reaction,\u201d her father, a primary care physician and medical commentator, said.

In 2003, she kicked two extra points in a game against Texas State University, according to her website.\n\nBut in 2004 Hnida made headlines for a different reason. The college football player had came forward with sexual assault allegations against a former teammate at the University of Colorado Boulder \u2014 during a time when the team was embroiled in controversy over accusations that it had used alcohol and sex to impress recruits.

Blessed with almost limitless oil wealth and tremendous sway in global affairs, its leaders still feel precarious enough in their power that they imprison royal rivals and assassinate critics like Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Myths about the kingdom and its affairs continue to flourish.\n\nMyth No. 1\n\nSaudi Arabia is a\n\ngood partner against Iran.\n\nPresident Trump has suggested that the world needs an Arab NATO to confront Iran, with Saudi Arabia playing a central role. Analysts like Anthony Cordesman argue that Saudi Arabia is a critical security partner, especially in checking Iran, a longtime American foe.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia is not a great U.S. partner in this contest. Despite a bonanza of spending on weapons and military tech \u2014 it is the world\u2019s third-largest buyer of armaments \u2014 the Saudi regime cannot fight a war alone and can\u2019t even effectively confront Iran in a proxy conflict. In 2015, the Saudis launched a war in Yemen in part to halt Iranian influence on their southern border. Almost four years later, the Saudis have succeeded only in destroying the country, increasing Iran\u2019s sway among the Houthi rebels there and making Saudi cities vulnerable to Houthi missiles.\n\nIn Lebanon, Saudi efforts on behalf of its client-leader, Prime Minister Saad Hariri, only made Iranian-backed Hezbollah stronger. In Iraq, Saudi leaders desperately recruited acolytes among tribal, secular and even radical Sunni rebels, with the hope of influencing Iraqi politics to counter Iran\u2019s pull. All of those efforts were doomed.\n\nMyth No. 2\n\nSaudi Arabia is a key ally\n\nin the fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cWe need Saudi Arabia in terms of our fight against all of the terrorism,\u201d Trump said in October, reiterating conventional wisdom about the kingdom\u2019s ability to help contain Islamist political violence. The 9/11 Commission report in 2004 praised Saudi Arabia because it \u201copenly discussed the problem of radicalism, criticized the terrorists as religiously deviant, reduced official support for religious activity overseas . . . and publicized arrests.\u201d\n\nBut the Saudi state has played a central role in spreading a splinter fundamentalist ideology that has justified terror across the globe. The siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979, al-Qaeda\u2019s activities in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the 9/11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon, and the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2014 were based on the idea of \u201cjihad against unbelievers\u201d and the excommunication of those who do not share Wahhabi religious outlooks, which are Saudi-sponsored interpretations. Riyadh expected its fundamentalists to launch jihad abroad and remain obedient at home. But the policy backfired, with fighters eventually targeting the nation\u2019s government.\n\nNow, the quality of Saudi intelligence on terrorism has been falling, according to Bruce Riedel, a former CIA and White House official, since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pushed out the former intelligence chief. And its proxy battles in Yemen, Syria and Iraq are helping to foment violent resistance among some of the region\u2019s Shiites.\n\nMyth No. 3\n\nSaudi Arabians are\n\nIslamic fundamentalists.\n\nThe kingdom seems to have an unfortunate knack for producing fundamentalist terrorists: 15 of the 19 hijackers of Sept. 11, 2001, as well as Osama bin Laden himself. In a report on Saudi religious influence, a senior Islamic cleric in Turkey noted that while he was meeting with Saudi clerics in Riyadh, the government executed 45 Saudi citizens for terrorism. \u201cI said: \u2018These people studied Islam for 10 or 15 years in your country. Is there a problem with the educational system?\u2019 \u201d In his book \u201cForce and Fanaticism,\u201d Simon Ross Valentine describes the nation as a hotbed of religious radicalism driven by the fundamentalist Wahhabi strain of Islam. Valentine witnessed the demolition of archaeological sites around Mecca and blamed Wahhabis, who object to saint veneration around sacred sites.\n\nBut while Wahhabism is a state ideology, not many Saudis subscribe to it. Researcher Mansoor Moaddel confirms that a moderate undercurrent pervades Saudi society \u2014 and that Saudis are less religious overall than people in other Middle Eastern countries.\n\nIn other Arab republics, including Egypt, Syria and Algeria, Islamic fundamentalism rose against secular regimes, but in Saudi Arabia, it was a product of the state, and it never became a true social movement. Although a minority of Saudis endorsed this project, the majority remained unconvinced, and many vehemently refused to be enlisted in it. The problem is that the state-controlled public sphere is closed to direct criticism of its Islamist policies. Critical Saudi voices who have rejected fundamentalism, including activist Raif Badawi, blogger Hamza Kashgari and writer Hassan Farhan al-Maliki, have been silenced, imprisoned or subjected to physical punishment.\n\nMyth No. 4\n\nSaudi Arabia's leaders are directing revolutionary reform.\n\nThe Guardian reported in 2017 that \u201ca transformation started by the new Saudi leadership of King Salman and his son and heir, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has already shaken most corners of the country.\u201d In the New York Times last year, Thomas Friedman praised the crown prince for ushering in a modern revolution: conducting an anti-corruption drive, ending the ban on women driving, reintroducing popular entertainment and preparing the economy for a post-oil era. And unlike other revolutions, Friedman wrote, \u201cthis one is led from the top down.\u201d\n\nThis notion makes a mockery of both revolution and reform. A revolution is a complete overthrow of a government and social order, which has not happened in Saudi Arabia. Cinemas, theaters and circuses are not symbols of real transformation. Young people may enjoy these superficial changes for the time being, but the government is still an absolute monarchy, now with even greater power concentrated in the hands of one individual. The economic transformation is stumbling, with the unemployment rate rising to more than 12 percent, and the social order has become more restrictive, repressive and dangerous. From detentions of critical clerics and female activists to the murder of Khashoggi, the terror often associated with revolutions is being used to deny real political change.\n\nMyth No. 5\n\nSaudi Arabia is a stabilizing force in the Middle East.\n\nMarcelle Wahba, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, argued in 2017 that the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, including Saudi Arabia, help maintain stasis. \u201cThe GCC countries are essentially status quo-oriented monarchies, and regional stability is a core goal,\u201d she wrote. Gen. Joseph Votel, the top commander of U.S. troops in the Middle East, said in late October that there is no change in U.S.-Saudi Arabia military relations, despite public outrage over Khashoggi\u2019s murder. \u201cSaudi Arabia is an extraordinarily influential and important leader of the Arab world within the region,\u201d he said. \u201c . . . Other partners in the region often look to Saudi Arabia for a lead, for leadership, direction, and how they approach broader security concerns.\u201d\n\nThe status quo is, however, one of the major sources of instability in the region. The 2011 Arab uprisings came at a time when this status quo \u2014 namely, decades of authoritarian rule \u2014 appeared to explode under demographic, economic and political pressure from truly pro-democratic forces. Saudi Arabia and its alarmed Persian Gulf allies acted as counter-revolutionaries determined to preserve the autocratic state of affairs.\n\nIn Egypt, Saudi money backing dictator Abdel Fatah al-Sissi returned the country to military rule, repression and political stagnation. In Syria, Saudi financial and military sponsorship of some rebels stifled democratic forces and started a sectarian civil war. In Bahrain, a direct Saudi military intervention led to the reversal of years of mass mobilization and the quashing of dissent. By ostracizing and sanctioning Qatar over its media and support for the Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi actions have caused the GCC to devolve into a redundant regional coalition that may never recover. Forcing the Lebanese prime minister, Hariri, to resign in Riyadh in 2017 (though he rescinded his resignation a month later) threatened to destabilize yet another Arab country with a fragile hold on peace. The worst came in Yemen, where a GCC-brokered agreement guaranteed the safe return of its president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who later turned against his Saudi sponsors. Since 2015, the Saudis have launched airstrikes on Yemen that have led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis and the total destruction of the country.\n\nSuch measures reflect Riyadh\u2019s erratic regional policy, the main purpose of which is to preserve the monarchy and authoritarian republicanism in the Arab world rather than to create long-term stability.\n\nFive myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

(Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably heard by now, El Ni\u00f1o is developing and anticipated to play a major role in the weather this coming winter. While El Ni\u00f1o winters are not a slam dunk for mega snowstorms, they have produced snowy conditions more frequently than La Ni\u00f1a winters, their opposite. We only have to look back at the excessively snowy El Ni\u00f1o winters of 2009-10 and 2002-03 to find recent examples.\n\nWith a weak-to-moderate El Ni\u00f1o now expected for the winter of 2018-19, seasonal outlooks from weather companies as well as television meteorologists all seem to be leaning snowy. Based on history alone, this is a decent bet. In Washington, historical El Ni\u00f1o snow odds are at worst around average. For a moderate El Ni\u00f1o in particular, there is a strong signal for considerably snowier conditions than normal.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) refers to the varying water temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. When waters are warmer than normal, El Ni\u00f1o conditions develop. When they are cooler than normal, La Ni\u00f1a is born. If water temperatures are near normal, we have neutral or \u201cLa Nada\u201d conditions.\n\nThe warmer and cooler waters associated with El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a shift weather patterns all over the world. In the case of El Ni\u00f1o, the warm Pacific water tends to inject more moisture into wintertime systems across the southern and eastern United States, which can increase snowfall (if it\u2019s cold enough).\n\n\n\n(Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)\n\nThe data is clear that El Ni\u00f1o is generally a positive for snow in Washington. The median snowfall for El Ni\u00f1o events of every intensity is above the long-term median. (We use median, rather than average, snowfall in this analysis to remove the effect of outlier winters that produced either a ton of snow or hardly any. These outliers tend to skew the statistics.)\n\n[Everything you ever wanted to know about snow in Washington, D.C., updated.]\n\nModerate El Ni\u00f1os are especially good for snow. At 23.6 inches, moderate El Ni\u00f1o winters have a median snowfall that is 151 percent higher than the overall long-term median of 15.6 inches.\n\nAlthough La Ni\u00f1as are generally less favorable for snow than El Ni\u00f1os, moderate La Ni\u00f1as have historically been quite snowy ranking second highest for median snowfall among all of the ENSO phases.\n\nThese numbers tend to support a historical best guess of near normal to above normal snowfall for El Ni\u00f1o winters around Washington. But every El Ni\u00f1o winter takes on its character, and other factors can influence how much snow falls.\n\n\n\n(Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)\n\nEl Ni\u00f1os have produced both Washington\u2019s snowiest and least snowy winters on record.\n\nBoth of Washington\u2019s least snowy winters (1972-73 and 1997-98) came during very strong El Ni\u00f1os. Yet the most recent very strong El Ni\u00f1o of 2015-16 delivered \u201cSnowzilla,\u201d one of the region\u2019s greatest snowfalls.\n\nThe bottom line is that while El Ni\u00f1os -- on balance -- favor more snow, events of every intensity have produced both snowy and non-snowy outcomes.\n\nTo add another layer to this analysis, El Ni\u00f1o events can be categorized not just by their strength but also by their location. Whether El Ni\u00f1os are centered in the eastern or central Pacific Ocean has important consequences for snowfall. El Ni\u00f1os centered in the central Pacific are sometimes called \u201cmodoki\u201d events.\n\nThe numbers are fairly convincing that central-based El Ni\u00f1os produce more snow than east-based events. Since 1950, central-based El Ni\u00f1os have a median snowfall over 20 inches compared with a median of less than 11 inches for east-based events.\n\nSome outlooks for this winter released so far have leaned toward a center-based event, but the development of some sort of east-central hybrid seems more likely.\n\nWhile it is fun for a snow lover to imagine the coming winter resembling 2009-10 or a 2002-03, it is important to remember they were both central-based El Ni\u00f1o events and probably stronger than the El Ni\u00f1o expected to develop this winter. Perhaps some similarities will emerge in how this winter\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o develops, but snowy expectations should remain somewhat in check for now until we see how it unfolds.\n\nCapital Weather Gang\u2019s official winter outlook, taking into account this El Ni\u00f1o analysis and several other factors, will be released in the next two weeks.\n\nENSO data for this post was drawn from Jan Null from 1950 to present, and from Eric Webb from 1877 to 1949.\n\nFor the analysis of east-based versus central-based El Ni\u00f1os, the consensus list from Table 1 in Yu et al., 2012 was applied.", "SAN FRANCISCO -- Thousands of Google employees walked off the job on Thursday in offices spanning from California to Dublin in protest of the company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment claims -- a powerful demonstration of the impact of the #metoo movement in the hyper-competitive and male-dominated tech industry.\n\nThe walkout, which took place a week after the New York Times revealed that Google had suppressed allegations of sexual misconduct against several of its executives, took aim at what organizers called a \u201cculture of complicity, dismissiveness, and support for perpetrators.\u201d\n\nManagers, rank-and-file engineers, men and women participating in the walkout said they were demanding broad changes in how the company handles harassment complaints, and that they were protesting in solidarity with colleagues who had been victimized under the current system.\n\n\u201cThe [Times] article provided a narrow window into a culture we, as Google employees, know well,\u201d the organizers wrote in a blog post announcing the protest. \u201cThese stories are our stories. We share them in hushed tones to trusted peers, friends, and partners. There are thousands of us, at every level of the company. And we\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\n\nIn a statement emailed to The Washington Post, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Google is supporting employees who choose to participate in the walkouts.\n\n\u201cEmployees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cWe are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\u201d A screensaver went out on corporate computers promoting the walkout, according to employees.\n\nAs the waves of #MeToo have broken out across U.S. industry, the movement\u2019s presence in Silicon Valley has uncovered patterns of abuse, gender inequality and a hush-hush culture in an environment that aims to be progressive.\n\nGoogle in particular is known for its individualistic culture in which engineers whose innovations are seen to bring enormous value to the company are rewarded with millions of dollars in payments -- even when they break the rules.\n\nAndy Rubin, the creator of Google\u2019s Android software, was reportedly paid $90 million when he left the company in 2014 after a sexual misconduct investigation deemed allegations against him were credible. Rubin denied the story in a tweet, saying it was \u201cpart of a smear campaign\u201d to disparage him during a divorce and custody battle.\n\nNews like the @nytimes report on @google's handling of Andy Rubin and other top execs is crushing. As much as I believe in supporting the company you work for, it's equally important to voice what you vehemently disagree with. We can do so much better https://t.co/PUNMQz9Y0T \u2014 Sanette Tanaka Sloan (@ssktanaka) October 26, 2018\n\nThe Times story also exposed allegations of sexual harassment against Richard DeVaul, a director at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. DeVaul resigned Tuesday, the Times reported.\n\nThat unequal system stands in contrast to the values promoted to the rank-and-file, some of the protesters said, who spoke anonymously because Google had instructed them not to speak to the media. They said they were proud Googlers who came to the company believing in a longstanding \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d philosophy. They said their concerns were as much about sexism as they were about managers\u2019 choices to protect powerful executives and demote or push out people who complain.\n\n\u201cWe have all heard stories of women who have been pushed out while men have been elevated,\u201d said one engineer at a San Francisco walkout.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we get to Google, we are told we are special. Google is special and we want to retain that. We want to display our values,\u201d said another protester who worked in sales.\n\nThe protest, called \u201cWalkout for Real Change,\u201d has five goals, including bringing an end to forced arbitration, improving processes for reporting sexual misconduct and reporting publicly on sexual harassment within the company.\n\nWe, Google employees and contractors, will walkout on November 1 at 11:10am to demand these five real changes. #googlewalkout pic.twitter.com/amgTxK3IYw \u2014 Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) November 1, 2018\n\nIn an essay published on the Cut, the seven core organizers of the protest said that over 60 percent of Google\u2019s offices around the world were participating in the walkout, amounting to thousands of employees. The stories that appeared in the Times offered just a \u201cnarrow window\u201d into tough realities of Google\u2019s culture, they wrote.\n\n\u201cAll employees and contract workers across the company deserve to be safe. Sadly, the executive team has demonstrated through their lack of meaningful action that our safety is not a priority,\u201d the organizers wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited for leadership to fix these problems, but have come to this conclusion: no one is going to do it for us.\u201d\n\nPichai, who was not chief executive at the time of the payments, responded to the Times reporting in a memo to employees in which he said Google had fired 48 employees, including \u201c13 senior managers and above\u201d for sexual misconduct in the past two years. These people had not been given payouts, Pichai said.\n\nNews of the walkout spread earlier this week, when BuzzFeed reported that a group of \u201c200 engineers\u201d were organizing a \u201cwomen\u2019s walk\u201d to protest the revelations in the Times. Since then, the movement has spread. Early Thursday, the walkout\u2019s Twitter account, @GoogleWalkout, shared photos of employees protesting at Google offices worldwide, including Berlin, Dublin, London, Singapore, Tokyo and Zurich.\n\nMost London Googlers who participated today congregated indoors due to the poor weather \u2014 some others braved the rain and cold! #GoogleWalkout https://t.co/McCx6rpJYX \u2014 Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) November 1, 2018\n\n\u201cEmployees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cWe are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\u201d\n\nThe walkouts represent the latest instance of employees pushing back to hold Google\u2019s leadership accountable. In June, Google opted not to extend its contract doing artificial intelligence work with the Defense Department after a wave of public backlash and employee resignations. In August, employees expressed outrage over the company\u2019s plans to develop a search engine for China that would allow the government to censor results, with more than 1,400 employees signing an internal letter asking the company to establish an oversight process to review the China project and other plans that \u201craise urgent moral and ethical issues,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nGoogle is a high-visibility company, present in the daily lives of millions or more, and their power isn\u2019t likely to be seriously threatened by the stories of rampant sexual misconduct or the walkouts alone, said Jeremy Robinson-Leon, president of Group Gordon, a corporate and crisis communications firm. But the company\u2019s livelihood does depend on being able to attract talent that will help propel its products and projects forward \u2014 something it could struggle to do if it can\u2019t prove its commitment to safety and transparency.\n\n\u201cIf Google doesn\u2019t make the changes necessary now and doesn\u2019t meet the expectations of the people who are walking out today and the others who share those feelings, that could be a significant problem and would not be one that would just go away,\u201d Robinson-Leon said.", "", "The Justice Department on Thursday unveiled a broad new initiative to combat what it says is mounting criminal economic activity by China, announcing the plan as U.S. officials unsealed charges against several individuals and Chinese and Taiwanese companies for trade-secret theft.\n\nThursday\u2019s actions follow a series of moves meant to put Beijing on notice. The Trump administration has prioritized countering threats to U.S. national and economic security as China seeks to supplant the United States as the world\u2019s dominant economic power. The administration already has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and since September federal prosecutors have brought charges in three intellectual property theft cases allegedly involving Chinese spies and hackers.\n\n\u201cChinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing \u2014 and it has been increasing rapidly,\u201d said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cEnough is enough. We\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\u201d\n\n[Read the indictment against agents of the Chinese government]\n\nThe initiative is significant in that it fuses ongoing efforts within the FBI, Justice Department and other federal agencies into a single coordinated initiative, and sends a clear message to Beijing that Chinese economic espionage \u2014 whether by cyber or human means \u2014 will not be tolerated, officials said. The Chinese embassy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs both countries place greater emphasis on competition and security, the big question, analysts say, is whether the two governments can maintain commercial engagement despite increasing tensions over the quest for technological supremacy. In the meantime, Washington is signaling that the gloves are off.\n\nUnder the initiative, Sessions said, the department will aggressively pursue trade-secret theft cases, and develop a strategy to identify researchers and defense industry employees who\u2019ve been \u201cco-opted\u201d by Chinese agents to transfer technology to China.\n\n\u201cChina wants the fruits of America\u2019s brainpower to harvest the seeds of its planned economic dominance,\u201d Assistant Attorney General John Demers said. With this new initiative, he said, \u201cwe will confront China\u2019s malign behaviors and encourage them to conduct themselves as they aspire to be one of the world\u2019s leading nations.\u201d\n\nThe indictment alleges the defendants conspired to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semiconductor company with a subsidiary in Taiwan. Micron is worth an estimated $100 billion and is the only company in the United States that makes \u201cdynamic random-access memory,\u201d or DRAM, high-capacity data storage used in computers, mobile devices and other electronics. The company has a 20 to 25 percent share of the world\u2019s supply of DRAM, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Chinese government set up a state-owned company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. Ltd., for the express purpose of developing DRAM technology and sought to learn trade secrets through the criminal acts of former employees of Micron\u2019s Taiwan branch.\n\nIn July 2015, the president of Micron\u2019s Taiwan subsidiary, Chen Zhengkun, also known as Stephen Chen, left to join United Microelectronics Corporation, a semiconductor foundry headquartered in Taiwan. Some months later, in early 2016, Jinhua, the Chinese company, began discussions with United Microelectronics to forge a technology cooperation agreement, according to the indictment. Chen helped negotiate the agreement, and in early 2017 became president of Jinhua in charge of its DRAM factory, prosecutors said.\n\nIt was Chen, Sessions alleged, who orchestrated the theft of trade secrets from Micron worth up to $8.75 billion.\n\nChen is said to have recruited former colleagues, including defendant He Jianting, or J.T. Ho, a Taiwanese national, who before leaving Micron allegedly stole confidential DRAM materials, U.S. officials say. Chen also brought on defendant Kenny Wang, a Micron manager and Taiwanese national who allegedly stole more than 900 files, some containing confidential DRAM designs, the indictment says. Wang allegedly downloaded secrets from Micron\u2019s servers in the United States and stored them on his Google Drive account, the indictment said.\n\n\u201cThis was,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California Alex Tse, \u201csome of the most advanced semiconductor technology in the world.\u201d\n\nIf convicted, the defendants face up to 14 years in prison and $5 million in fines. The two companies, United Microelectronics and Jinhua, could face fines worth more than $20 billion. The three men charged Thursday are in China, U.S. officials said.\n\nThis week, the Commerce Department added Jinhua to its \u201centity list\u201d to prevent it from buying goods and services in the United States, effectively cutting it off from the U.S. market. Without equipment sold only in the United States, Jinhua cannot build the DRAM chips.\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday also filed a civil suit in San Francisco seeking to stop the further transfer of these stolen trade secrets and to prevent the defendants from exporting to the United States any products resulting from the alleged theft.\n\n\u201cWe are not just reacting to crimes \u2014 we are acting to block the defendants from doing any more harm to Micron,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nThe attorney general outlined a number of laws that prosecutors would use, including the Foreign Agents Registration Act, to identify unregistered agents seeking to advance China\u2019s political agenda.\n\nCongress in August passed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act to expand the government\u2019s power to review investments from foreign countries \u2014 a response to China\u2019s efforts to obtain U.S. technology through mergers, acquisitions and takeovers. Last month, the Treasury Department released interim rules to implement the new law. Sessions said the Justice Department will work with Treasury on further developing those regulations.\n\nThe Justice Department also will target Chinese threats to U.S. companies that provide components for sensitive technologies, especially those in the telecommunications sector as it readies for the transition to 5G networks.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with the state of confrontational actions over the last couple of weeks taken by the administration to tackle everything China\u2019s trying to do,\u201d said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than intellectual property theft. It\u2019s supply chain risk. It\u2019s China\u2019s efforts to be global leaders in 5G. It\u2019s traditional espionage. It\u2019s influence operations. This is part of a much broader whole-of-government approach to countering China\u2019s efforts to gain strategic advantage, particularly in emerging technology.\u201d\n\nSessions noted that earlier this year, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer found that Chinese sponsorship of hacking into American businesses has gone on for more than a decade. By some estimates, the cost to the U.S. economy is $30 billion annually. In September 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that China would not target U.S. companies for the economic benefit of nonmilitary Chinese companies.\n\n\u201cObviously that commitment has not been met,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, a cyber expert and chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, said the Chinese military curtailed its commercial hacking in 2016 but that over the past year, operatives affiliated with China\u2019s Ministry of State Security have increasingly taken up the slack, stealing military, medical, agricultural, high-tech and other secrets.\n\nFor months, the Trump administration has been considering ways to decouple the U.S. and Chinese tech sectors: restricting visas for Chinese students in the scientific, engineering and math fields, banning Chinese telecommunications equipment companies from U.S. 5G networks, expanding export controls on U.S. tech firms, and increasing official scrutiny of Chinese investments and joint U.S.-Chinese research, Sacks said.\n\n\u201cThis initiative is an important set of hammer blows against China\u2019s efforts to disadvantage American companies, steal their intellectual property, and exercise unwanted influence in our universities and political system,\u201d said James Mulvenon, a China expert and general manager of SOS International\u2019s Special Programs Division, which provides consulting services to intelligence and defense agencies.", "\n\nRandy Edsall, observer of Maryland athletics.

Ohio State, Nebraska\u2019s opponent, has not been all that good at stopping said big plays: The Buckeyes' defense ranks 105th in stopping explosive plays on the ground, and 9.4 percent of their opponents' overall plays have gone for at least 20 yards (ranking 108th nationally). Ohio State is a double-digit favorite for the sixth time in its past seven games \u2014 as of this writing, the Buckeyes are giving 17.5 points \u2014 but they\u2019ve covered the number just once in those games, and that was against Tulane. Their defense\u2019s inability to stop big plays is a big reason for this. . . .\n\nCBS\u2019s prime time SEC game later in the day will get much of the attention, but the afternoon affair between Georgia and Kentucky is worthy of your time if only because of the whimsical fact that the Wildcats \u2014 the football Wildcats \u2014 are playing a meaningful game in the month of November. But it\u2019s true! The winner here will be the SEC East\u2019s representative in the conference title game because Florida, the only other team in the division with fewer than three losses, lost to both Georgia and Kentucky, which never has finished better than a tie for second in the division and has finished last or next-to-last in 19 of 26 SEC seasons. The Wildcats only got to this point because of last weekend\u2019s crazy 15-14 comeback win at Missouri, when they erased a 14-3 deficit with just more than five minutes to play. The first touchdown on the comeback came on Lynn Bowden\u2019s 67-yard punt return for a score. Bowden would finish the day with 13 catches for 166 yards \u2014 a major accomplishment for one of the nation\u2019s rushing-intensive teams \u2014 but his punt return was his first of the season. He simply went up to Coach Mark Stoops and demanded that he be given the chance. Now his team is playing for an improbable division title. . . .\n\n[A huge weekend for SEC football reveals the ever-expanding empire of Sabanistan]\n\nMichigan defensive end Chase Winovich has dubbed the Wolverines' current slate of games as their \u201cRevenge Tour,\u201d a.k.a. games against the four Big Ten teams that beat Michigan last season. The first two tour dates went well \u2014 double-digit wins over Wisconsin and Michigan State \u2014 and now the Wolverines host Penn State, which beat Michigan by 29 last season in State College, Pa. The Nittany Lions have righted their ship a bit since losses to Ohio State and Michigan State, but it\u2019s unclear whether quarterback Trace McSorely is healthy: He suffered a lower-leg injury that caused him to miss a few series against Iowa last weekend, though he returned to the game and played well. . . .\n\n[Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that Michigan will play at Penn State.]\n\nThe CFP committee gave Saturday night\u2019s main event between Alabama and LSU slightly more juice by slotting the Tigers into the No. 3 spot ahead of Notre Dame, but the Tigers perhaps should be wary of the placement. Auburn, the No. 3 team in the first-ever CFP poll in October 2014, preceded to lose four of its final six games and ended up in the Outback Bowl. Ohio State was ranked No. 3 in first CFP poll of 2015 but was relegated to the Fiesta Bowl after a loss to Michigan State. The inaugural CFP poll of 2016 had Michigan at No. 3; the Wolverines went 2-2 down the stretch. And last year, Notre Dame was in the cursed No. 3 spot; the Fighting Irish were trounced by Miami two weeks later and then by Stanford two weeks after that. Nevertheless, the Tigers seem unmoved by both their unfortunate placement and the fact that they have to play the most dominant-looking team in recent memory. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of this game,\u201d LSU quarterback Joe Burrow said this week. \u201cNo one on this team is scared of this game.

Vote Republican now! https://t.co/0pWiwCHGbh pic.twitter.com/2crea9HF7G \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2018\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to our intrepid fact-checkers to document the lies in this ad, other than to note that just about every word in it is false. What\u2019s more important is the president\u2019s objectives and tactics, not to mention the fact that he put out this rancid poison just five days after a gunman killed 11 worshippers in a Pittsburgh synagogue, the worst anti-Semitic massacre in American history, in part because he believed the conspiracy theories propagated by the president and his supporters about immigrants threatening America, then joined it to his hatred of the Jews he thought were responsible. Five days.\n\nIf you have a long memory, you\u2019ll recall that in 2016 many Republicans assured us that once he beheld the majesty of the Oval Office and its awesome responsibilities, Trump would become \u201cpresidential.\u201d The bombastic, dishonest race-baiter we watched during the campaign was really just an act, and in office he\u2019d become more serious and responsible.\n\nWhat actually happened was just the opposite. It\u2019s true that Trump isn\u2019t the same man we saw on the campaign trail in 2016. He\u2019s worse.\n\nBecause it lacks even the subtlety your average racist demagogue musters in 2018, this ad is particularly Trumpian. From the moment he became a candidate, Trump would say explicitly what others would only imply, in ways that some found thrilling and others found appalling. Sometimes it was because saying it explicitly would make you sound like a toddler; for instance, while a regular candidate might find ways to persuade you of their intelligence, none but Trump would come out and say \u201cI\u2019m, like, really smart,\u201d and if they did you\u2019d immediately conclude that smart is the last thing they are.\n\nBut whether Trump is, like, really smart is to some degree a matter of opinion and interpretation. At other times, when Trump says explicitly what others only imply he moves right toward claims that are factually false and utterly horrific.\n\nLet\u2019s compare this latest case to its famous precursor, that of Willie Horton. When George H.W. Bush used that story to turn voters against Michael Dukakis in 1988, he would tell the lurid tale and then conclude, in the politician\u2019s common idiom, that it raised serious questions about Dukakis\u2019 judgment. Since it wasn\u2019t as though prison furlough policy was going to be a serious issue for the president to address, Bush at least maintained some plausible deniability by allowing the audience to make the most racist conclusions themselves. He didn\u2019t have to say out loud what he wanted voters to believe, because they\u2019d do it all on their own.\n\nHad Donald Trump been the Republican nominee that year, he would literally have said, \u201cMichael Dukakis wants scary black men to kill you and rape your wife.\u201d\n\nWe all know he would, just as he now says \u201cA vote for Democrats is a vote to liquidate America\u2019s borders and it\u2019s a vote to let fentanyl, heroin and other deadly drugs pour across our borders,\u201d and claims ludicrously about a deranged killer who was deported once under Bill Clinton and once under George W. Bush that \u201cDemocrats let him in. Democrats let him stay.\u201d\n\nBut please, let\u2019s not get ourselves into a debate about whether Trump is \u201creally\u201d a racist in his heart. I happen to think the evidence on that score is at this point beyond dispute, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters are the things he says and does: the way he encourages his supporters to nurture their own racism, the way he promotes resentment and division at every opportunity, the way he absolutely, positively believes that hate is what got him to the White House and hate his what will keep him there.\n\nTrump is the most racist president in modern history, not because of what is or isn\u2019t in his heart but because of the despicable way he has acted. There is little doubt that there is no depth to which he will not sink. Seriously: Try to come up with the most horrific dirty campaign trick or piece of demagoguery you can think of, then ask yourself: Would Trump do this if he thought it would help him win the next election, or would his ethical compass prevent him? The answer will always be: Yes, he would do that. He would lie, he would cheat, he would steal, he would promote racism and misogyny and anti-Semitism and xenophobia and every other hatred imaginable if he thought it would get a few more of his supporters to the polls.\n\nWe know he would because he has already done all those things. And he\u2019s not finished yet.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump\u2019s racist ad shows how low Republicans have sunk\n\nErik Wemple: CNN correctly calls Trump\u2019s new immigration-fear ad \u2018racist\u2019\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump knows his conspiracy theories incite violence. He keeps pushing them anyway.\n\nRobert Suro: Democrats are AWOL on immigration. They need to speak up.", "Republican Gov. Scott Walker arrived at the Milwaukee Bearing and Machining plant one afternoon earlier this week to a hail of applause from the assembled workers and supporters holding campaign placards and straining for cellphone photos.\n\nThe company he was visiting, which supplies oil and gas producers and others, had seen a significant decline in its business going into 2016. Since then it has rebounded, thanks in part to changes in federal regulations. \u201cThis year has been great,\u201d said Shelly Judkins, the company\u2019s sales manager. \u201cThe biggest problem we have is finding skilled labor to fill the positions we need.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of economic change about which Walker has been preaching as he campaigns for reelection, that of a state on the move upward. When he came into office eight years ago, he told the audience, the state economy was \u201ca mess.\u201d Today, he said, \u201cThings are completely different,\u201d with low unemployment and more people at work than ever. \u201cWe turned this state around,\u201d he said.\n\nIf that were all the Wisconsin gubernatorial election were about, Walker might expect to be cruising toward another four years in office. But this is the same governor whose initial moves \u2014 taking aim at bargaining rights of public employee unions \u2014 brought angry demonstrators to the state capitol in Madison, set off bitter arguments that separated friend from friend and made an already divided state deeply polarized around his leadership.\n\nOutwardly things appear calmer in Wisconsin these days, but beneath the surface divisions remain around Walker and around President Trump, whose 22,700-vote victory in the state helped secure his electoral college majority. Few people are neutral about Walker, which is why, a few days from Tuesday\u2019s balloting, he is in a struggle against Democrat Tony Evers, the state superintendent of public instruction. A Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday showed a dead-even race, with both candidates at 47 percent.\n\nWalker is trying to hold back forces that could dramatically change the political complexion of the entire Midwest. For the past eight years, Republicans have controlled governorships across the region. With GOP-controlled legislatures, they enacted conservative policy agendas and in some cases drew legislative and congressional district lines that greatly benefited their party.\n\n\n\nTony Evers, the Democratic candidate for governor of Wisconsin, speaks at a rally in support of Wisconsin Democrats on Oct. 26 at North Division High School in Milwaukee. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nToday the GOP\u2019s hold on power is at risk. By the end of Tuesday, it\u2019s possible, though not necessarily probable, that Democrats could hold every governorship from Iowa through Pennsylvania, with the exception of Indiana. Democrats are favored to hold governorships in Minnesota and Pennsylvania and to pick up the governorship in Illinois. Gubernatorial seats in Iowa and Ohio, both of which are in GOP hands, are in the toss-up category.\n\nBut there\u2019s no contest quite like Wisconsin\u2019s, given Walker\u2019s history and that he is seeking a third term, something only one other Wisconsinite \u2014 Republican Tommy Thompson \u2014 achieved. And this marks the fourth time Walker has asked voters to make or keep him as governor: After winning the election in 2010, he weathered a contentious recall election in 2012. Targeted by organized labor, he was dubbed \u201cDead Man Walker\u201d by Time magazine ahead of the recall but managed to win by seven percentage points. Two years later, he won reelection by six points.\n\n\u201cIn \u201910 and \u201914, we had momentum on our side,\u201d Walker said in a phone interview the morning after his appearance in Menomonee Falls. \u201cThe wind was at our back.\u201d That\u2019s no longer the case. \u201cI\u2019ve been warning since last year, even before last year, that this is a tough state and the left is angry,\u201d Walker said.\n\nPresidentially, Wisconsin has featured some of the closest races in the country over the past 18 years. Trump won the state by less than a percentage point two years ago, and Democrats in 2000 and 2004 won it be less than half a point. Only Barack Obama had easy victories.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s election, Democrats have scored special election victories in the state that Walker said should provide a wake-up call for complacent supporters. \u201cThose things were all tangible reminders of what we were saying,\u201d Walker said.\n\nWalker has held one public office or another for the past quarter century. Asked why he needs a third term as governor, he said, \u201cI want to finish the job.\u201d By that, he said he meant focusing on developing and building a skilled workforce for the state\u2019s growing economy. To do that, he said he is prepared to invest in worker training and education. \u201cMy goal is not to just train and educate the workforce but to grow it,\u201d he said.\n\nWalker\u2019s critics say that pledge to be an education governor rings hollow, given his record. Campaigning in Milwaukee earlier in the week, Evers blasted that record. \u201cFor eight years, we\u2019ve had a governor who hasn\u2019t dealt with the issue of student loan debt,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s demonized our teachers and he\u2019s cut hundreds of millions of dollars out of our public education budget.\u201d Someone in the crowd yelled, \u201cVote him out!\u201d\n\nEvers said he would give $1.5 billion in state aid to school districts if he is elected. Walker says Evers would raise taxes to do all he is pledging to do. Evers, in a telephone interview, responded by saying: \u201cHe is a liar. . . . I\u2019m planning to raise no taxes.\u201d\n\nOn the economy, Evers argues that despite low unemployment, many Wisconsin families are still struggling. \u201cHis economic record is basically skin deep,\u201d Evers said. \u201cIf you look below the surface, there are lots of problems.\u201d\n\nWalker, like Republicans across the country, has been put on the defensive over health care, specifically the issue of protections for people with preexisting conditions. He pushed his state to join a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which contains those protections, but he has pledged to provide those protections through state law, regardless of what happens in that case.\n\nEvers said such legislation would not provide the same protections as in the federal law and also questioned whether the legislature would approve it. So far the state Senate has resisted. Walker said he could get the measure through the legislature but doubts that Evers could if elected. \u201cOn this issue, he said, \u201cI\u2019m really the only choice in this election.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates have turned to high-profile surrogates for help in turning out voters. Obama and former vice president Joe Biden have campaigned in behalf of Evers. Trump held a rally recently in north central Wisconsin, aimed clearly at energizing voters in rural areas of the state where he did well in 2016 and where Walker must turn out a sizable vote to win Tuesday. The Marquette poll suggests that Walker is struggling in some of those areas, compared to previous campaigns, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nWalker and Trump have had an up-and-down relationship, dating back to the 2016 campaign. Walker was seen as an early front-runner for the GOP nomination but faded quickly once Trump became a candidate. He quit the race long before the primaries began and later endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ahead of the Wisconsin primary.\n\nNow, Walker says he and the president have formed a working relationship, even if they don\u2019t share the same style politically. Walker pointed to the recent trade agreement with Canada that he said would be good for Wisconsin dairy farmers. He says he pushed the president to take on the issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with everything he says or does or how he does it,\u201d Walker said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way Tony Evers gets that dairy deal done, because no way he can connect with the president.\u201d\n\nAsked what kind of factor Trump plays in the gubernatorial race, Evers said: \u201cWe\u2019re not running against the president. Our opponent is Scott Walker.\u201d\n\nWalker has frustrated his opponents repeatedly during his time in office. The question in these last days is whether he has the wherewithal to do it one more time.", "\n\nMortgage rates have risen substantially in the past year. (istockphoto and dwuan d june/twp/istockphoto and dwuan d june/twp)\n\nMortgage rates moved lower for the second time in three weeks.\n\nAccording to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average slipped to 4.83 percent with an average 0.5 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) It was 4.86 percent a week ago and 3.94 percent a year ago.\n\nThe 15-year fixed-rate average fell to 4.23 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 4.29 percent a week ago and 3.27 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average fell to 4.04 percent with an average 0.3 point. It was 4.14 percent a week ago and 3.23 percent a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMortgage rates declined slightly this week as continued market volatility caused bond rates to pause their upward trajectory,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \u201cStocks and bonds appear to be reacting to the cost increases businesses are facing, which has led to uncertainty over profitability. Today\u2019s lower mortgage rates are a mixed bag for housing. Builders are facing the same cost increases as other businesses. This is making it next to impossible to build entry-level homes, which could eventually hold back the homeownership growth rate.\u201d\n\n[Even retirees with sizable assets can find qualifying for a mortgage challenging]\n\nFueled by first-time home buyers, the homeownership rate rose to 64.4 percent in the third quarter. However, sluggish data are raising concerns about a slowdown in the housing market. Home price gains were below 6 percent for the first time in a year, according to the most recent Case-Shiller home prices index. Existing and new-home sales fell last month, while pending home sales were flat.\n\n\u201cWhile higher mortgage rates have led to a decline in home sales this year, the weakness has been concentrated in expensive segments versus entry-level and first-time buyer which remains firm throughout most of the rest of the country,\u201d Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement. \u201cDespite higher mortgage rates, the monthly mortgage payment remains affordable. For many buyers the chronic lack of entry-level supply is a larger hurdle than higher mortgage rates because choices are limited and the inventory shortage has caused home prices to rise well above fundamentals.\u201d\n\nA strong jobs report this week may push mortgage rates higher. Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found more than half of the experts it surveyed say rates will rise in coming week. Shashank Shekhar, chief executive of Arcus Lending, is one who predicts rates will go up.\n\n\u201cAfter staying mostly stable for three weeks, the market mood is turning bearish towards the mortgage-backed securities again,\u201d Shekhar said. \u201cThe stock market has rebounded, ADP private payroll report showed a huge jump, and the October Consumer Confidence clocked the best reading in 18 years. All of this explains the bearish tone because good news for the economy is usually bad news for MBS, which then pushes the mortgage rates higher.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, mortgage applications retreated, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index \u2014 a measure of total loan application volume \u2014 declined 2.5 percent from a week earlier. The refinance index fell 4 percent from the previous week, while the purchase index dropped 2 percent.\n\nThe refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 39.4 percent of all applications.\n\n\u201cThe healthy economy, which grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter, continues to keep overall housing demand high,\u201d said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and chief executive. \u201cA volatile October for the stock market, however, as well as rates being much higher than a year ago, appear to be causing some prospective buyers to pause. As a result, purchase applications last week were down from a year ago for the first time since August.\u201d\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nMortgage rates are on the rise.

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nIf it\u2019s November, it\u2019s time to talk about what\u2019s wrong with the Washington Wizards, who are 1-6 after losing four out of five on their West Coast road trip. How much time do you have? The team\u2019s defense is atrocious, John Wall and Bradley Beal are calling out teammates without naming names, Dwight Howard hasn\u2019t played a minute due to an injured buttocks and pundits are wondering, again, whether it\u2019s time to blow up the whole operation and start over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit too early to say something is broken,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Tony Kornheiser said on Wednesday\u2019s episode of \u201cPardon the Interruption.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult schedule when you go on a five-game, eight-day West Coast trip right away. And they haven\u2019t had Howard yet. The guy they have in the middle, [Ian] Mahinmi, doesn\u2019t score, so they\u2019re going to be better immediately with Howard, who is going to play the next game. So Howard, for a month or two, will be good until everybody in the locker room hates him.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that Kornheiser offered this assessment while dressed as Gritty, the Philadelphia Flyers' orange, googly-eyed mascot, for PTI\u2019s Halloween-themed show.\n\nCo-host Michael Wilbon, who was dressed as Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, said he would like to see Otto Porter Jr. better integrated in Washington\u2019s offense. He also wondered what options the Wizards have to revamp their roster with Porter, Wall and Beal all signed to enormous contracts, and Mahinmi set to make more than $15 million in each of the next two years.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be some resentment of Porter,\u201d Wilbon said. \u201cPorter\u2019s a guy who\u2019s been one of the top three-point shooters in terms of percentage the last two years. What are they gonna do? They\u2019re not a franchise to eat millions of dollars. They\u2019re not a franchise to do that. That\u2019s not how they operate.\u201d\n\n[Otto Porter Jr. plays \u2018the right way.\u2019 But more is expected of a max player.]\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t play any defense at all,\u201d Kornheiser said of a squad that has allowed an NBA-worst 122.4 points per game. \u201cWall and Beal complain about all the other players. They have a coach who says, after they lose, every single time they lose, he says, \u2018This is unacceptable.\u2019 But it isn\u2019t, because he plays the same five guys next time, the same rotation next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do they do?\u201d Wilbon asked again.\n\n\"I think you would agree with this, if they want to try to get to the top, they\u2019re going to have to trade one of those guys,\u201d Gritty, er, Kornheiser, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not working. And you know this is true.\u201d\n\nThe Ringer\u2019s Bill Simmons would certainly agree. Two years ago, when the Wizards were 6-11 after a 2-8 start, Simmons suggested that Washington trade Wall for draft picks and \u201cdo a complete tankapalooza\" in order to rebuild. Instead, the Wizards kept Wall, who helped lead the greatest in-season turnaround in NBA history. Washington came within a Kelly Olynyk career game of advancing to the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nWhile Simmons\u2019s colleague, John Gonzalez, encouraged Wizards fans this week to enjoy the soap opera in General Manager Ernie Grunfeld\u2019s 15th year at the helm, Simmons recently dreamed up a three-team trade involving Wall. In Simmons\u2019s hypothetical, Miami Heat point guard Goran Dragic and Wizards center Jason Smith would go to the Memphis Grizzlies, Wall would go to the Heat and Grizzlies point guard Mike Conley would go to Washington.\n\n\u201cMemphis cuts some salary, Miami rolls the dice with John Wall,\u201d Simmons said on his podcast last week. \u201cWho the hell knows what [Wall\u2019s] ceiling is at this point? Washington gets a stable veteran point guard that we all love, Mike Conley, who changes their team a little bit. A little more professional.\u201d\n\nSimmons argued that the Wizards are \u201can obvious panic-button team\u201d already in this young season for several reasons.\n\n\u201cThe chemistry seems way off, I\u2019m not sure that coach is long for that job, and they have an owner who just won the Stanley Cup who is now feeling himself a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s sustainable with the three guys they have. Somebody\u2019s gotta move somewhere.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, longtime NBA coach Stan Van Gundy, who lost his job in Detroit over the summer, said he would be surprised if the Wizards made any drastic moves before the offseason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a rough start, but hey, they\u2019ve already been out on a West Coast trip,\" Van Gundy said this week on the \u201cDan Le Batard Show.\u201d \u201cFive of their seven games have been away. We\u2019ll see what happens. I think Dwight\u2019s going to play Friday night against Oklahoma City, and we\u2019ll see how they play as they get their team together. If they decide to break it down, they certainly can get some good assets back for Wall and particularly for Beal, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll go that way anytime soon. ... From all I know, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Ted Leonsis is going to want. I think they think the East is wide open and that if they get everybody healthy and going the way they can that they\u2019ll contend in the East. I think they\u2019ll give it at least this year.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why he thinks 25-year-old Beal is a better trade chip for the Wizards than 28-year-old Wall, Van Gundy said it\u2019s not all about the fact that the Wall\u2019s game is predicated on speed and he\u2019s not getting any quicker as he approaches 30.\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s also got good size,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cI think he\u2019s become a good, smart decision-maker. He\u2019s still got value. He\u2019s going to be a good player, but I don\u2019t think he is one of the top five or six guys certainly at his position, maybe not even a top 10 guy at his position, where Beal certainly is that at his position. I think he\u2019d have a little bit more value, but again, both of them would bring back good value. I just don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see that at least until the offseason.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Wizards:\n\nWizards finish season\u2019s longest road trip battered, broken and out of answers\n\n\u2018Horrendous\u2019 defense has defined these Wizards\n\nAustin Rivers and Doc Rivers reunite as rivals\n\nThe Wizards are starting their annual meltdown early this season", "", "", "\n\nPresident Trump speaks during a campaign rally on Wednesday in Estero, Fla., at the Hertz Arena to help Republican candidates running in the midterms. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s blatantly racist ad \u2014 showing an illegal immigrant boasting about killing police officers \u2014 is a fitting final pitch for a party and a campaign that are now nearly entirely focused on whipping up xenophobia. I won\u2019t link to the ad; The Post describes it thusly:\n\nThe man on the screen has a shaved head and a mustache and long chin hair. Smiling, he announces, \u201cI killed f\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2014 cops.\u201d The man is Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported Mexican immigrant who was given the death penalty in April for killing two California law enforcement officers in 2014. At the time of the shootings, Bracamontes was in the United States illegally \u2014 and now, with the midterm election approaching, he\u2019s the star of the GOP\u2019s latest campaign ad. . . . The text is superimposed over videos of Bracamontes appearing to show no remorse for his crimes, and even declaring, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill more cops soon.\u201d More footage follows: Throngs of unidentified people rioting in unidentified streets and pushing down fences in undisclosed locations. A Fox News Channel correspondent interviewing a man identified only as \u201cdeported immigrant in caravan,\u201d who asks to be pardoned for attempted murder. \u2026 \u201cWho else would Democrats let in?\u201d the video asks. An image of Bracamontes smiling reappears before being replaced by text, \u201cPresident Donald Trump and Republicans are making America safe again.\u201d\n\nTo all the Republicans who think that words don\u2019t matter, who rationalize support for the president because of judges or tax cuts, who insist that domestic terrorism is unrelated to normalization of virulent racist rhetoric and who remain silent believing they have no moral responsibility for this brand of politics, I would say this is reason enough to vote, as my colleague Max Boot has suggested, against each and every Republican on the ballot. We have not seen individual Republican candidates, let alone House and Senate leaders, denounce the ad or insist that Trump take it down. Silence is assent. And therefore each one deserves the ire of decent voters.\n\nTo all the White House staffers who think they are \u201csaving\u201d the United States from harm, who bristle at the notion they should be shunned from polite society (not harassed, shunned) and who insist that they be treated like staffers of previous administrations (e.g. thanked for their service), I would say that you will share the blame for a dark chapter in American history.\n\nTo Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Lou Dobbs, Fox shareholders, Fox producers and Fox executives and other on-air Fox personalities, I would say that this is in large part your doing. You\u2019ve spent years drumming up fear of immigrants, misrepresenting the danger they pose, blurring the line between criminals and noncriminals (including \u201cdreamers\u201d) and sending dog whistles \u2014 no, make that trumpet blasts \u2014 to the white nationalists. I would say to you that Fox is not a news organization but a source of material and affirmation for the worst elements in our society, a small sliver of whom become violent. It\u2019s not a place where reputable news people should want to work, nor a network that advertisers should support or viewers should indulge.\n\nI appreciate the condemnation of Republicans such as Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) (\u201cThis is just a new low in campaigning. It\u2019s sickening\u201d), but they need to do more. It\u2019s not enough for Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), as he did yesterday before the ad hit, to mildly rebuke Trump, without even mentioning him (\u201cWe all know what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s all about revving up the base, using fear to stimulate people to come out at the polls.\u201d). They need to demand that the ad come down and implore their colleagues on the ballot to denounce it. If the colleagues refuse, Flake and Corker should pull endorsements from them.\n\nThe GOP has sunk to new lows, but likely not hit bottom.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nApple, Facebook, Google and Uber are among 56 companies that told the Trump administration on Thursday that they oppose any change in federal policy that would define gender on the basis of one\u2019s biological sex at birth \u2014 the latest clash between tech giants and the White House over civil rights issues.\n\nIn a letter to President Trump, the businesses said such a policy would be discriminatory and harm their workers. The companies said they \u201cstand with the millions of people in America who identify as transgender, gender non-binary, or intersex, and call for all such people to be treated with the respect and dignity everyone deserves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe oppose any administrative and legislative efforts to erase transgender protections through reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe also fundamentally oppose any policy or regulation that violates the privacy rights of those that identify as transgender, gender non-binary, or intersex.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump said he is \u201cseriously\u201d rethinking how transgender people are treated under federal law, telling reporters that his administration has \u201ca lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now.\u201d The effort has been led internally by the Department of Health and Human Services, which last year told officials not to use the word \u201ctransgender\u201d in their budget documents.\n\nThe move marked the Trump administration\u2019s latest effort to roll back federal protections for transgender people, including students who seek to use the bathrooms of their choice at school, and it drew an outcry from equal-rights organizations. Fifteen of those groups, led by the Human Rights Campaign and Out Leadership, organized a campaign to get business leaders to speak out against the Trump administration\u2019s potential policy change.\n\nCompanies signing the tech-heavy letter include Airbnb, Amazon.com, Ben & Jerry\u2019s Homemade, IBM, Intel, Lyft, Microsoft, Dow Chemical and Warby Parker.

(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nShould Robert Bowers, the man who allegedly killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, be called a terrorist? News reports suggest that he expressed extreme anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant views on social media platforms, claiming that Jews were committing genocide against white people by encouraging a migrant \u201cinvasion\u201d from Central America.\n\nIn other words, the shooting may have been motivated by an extreme ideology, one of the criteria often used in definitions of terrorism (see the FBI terrorism definition here).\n\nGeorgetown professor Daniel Byman argues that it is \u201cprobably right\u201d to call Bowers a terrorist but notes that public officials and the media often do not know what to call acts of violence by domestic extremists. Many observers voiced similar ambivalence about what to call Dylann Roof, the self-declared white supremacist who killed nine African American worshipers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, S.C., in 2015.\n\nBut what if Bowers was an Islamist militant instead of an alleged white supremacist? Would the terrorism label be readily used? In a forthcoming article with my colleague Vito D\u2019Orazio, we find that the answer is likely \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n[What political science can tell us about mass shootings]\n\nHere\u2019s how we did our research\n\nWe recruited 1,198 U.S.-based participants in April 2016 through Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk service and conducted an experiment in which we presented subjects with a (fictional) news story describing a foiled shooting attempt. Participants were asked to describe the details of the story and label the type of violence reported from options that included terrorism and mass shooting, along with other labels such as individual homicide, gang violence and \u201cunknown.\u201d (Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nWe divided participants into six groups of roughly 200 participants, each of which received slightly different stories. In the control group, we do not mention the suspect\u2019s name or ethnicity. In another group, we describe the failed shooter as being white, while a third group is told he\u2019s Arab American. A fourth group was told that the white shooter belongs to a white-supremacist group; a fifth that the Arab American shooter belongs to an Islamist extremist group; and a sixth that a person of unidentified ethnicity belongs to an unspecified extremist organization.\n\nThe results are statistically significant and striking. Relative to the control, the Arab suspect was 18 percentage points more likely to be called a terrorist. Conversely, there was no statistical difference between how participants labeled the white suspect and the control group\u2019s unidentified suspect.\n\nWhile belonging to any militant organization raises the odds of labeling an act of violence as terrorism, the ideology of the group matters a lot. Only 9.5 percent of respondents called the white supremacist a terrorist, while 58 percent did so for the Islamist extremist. Indeed, compared with those told that the suspect \u201chas ties to an [unspecified] extremist group,\u201d participants who were told the suspect belonged to a white-supremacist organization actually reduced the odds that they called the incident terrorism.\n\nAmericans are quick to label Muslim shooters terrorists and white shooters mentally ill\n\nWhat we found is consistent with what Connor Huff and Joshua Kertzer found in a similar study, strengthening the idea that Americans are more likely to call Muslim perpetrators terrorists than they are to use that label for white perpetrators. This adds confidence that our results are not an artifact of our research method.\n\n[If the gunman was Muslim, would we be talking about Las Vegas \u2018terrorism\u2019?]\n\nWe ran a second wave of our study, this time with 450 participants, shortly after the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016, in which Omar Mateen, who was Muslim, killed 49 people, to see whether the results grew stronger in the aftermath of a high-profile incident. The nightclub shooting had no effect on our results; the link between religion/ethnicity and the terrorism label seems to be quite stable.\n\nParticipants in both rounds of our experiment also were more likely to tell us that the white shooter was mentally ill, while the Arab American shooter was thought to be motivated by political or religious ideology \u2014 even though the story did not mention motive.\n\nApparently, Americans view violent acts very differently depending on the ethnicity of the perpetrator. Whites and self-declared white supremacists are rarely called terrorists, while people of Middle East descent are quickly given that label.\n\nWhat we label violence has important consequences\n\nDoes it matter? Yes. Calling an act of violence \u201cterrorism\u201d has legal, political and psychological implications. Mass shootings provoke policy debates about gun control and appropriate mental-health screening, which we also address in our study. Most of the time, such incidents prompt little meaningful legislation. The term \u201cterrorism\u201d is arguably more pejorative and threatening than \u201cmass shooting\u201d or \u201chate crime.\u201d Terrorist incidents have pushed the United States to fight wars, change airport screening regulations and restrict immigration, among other responses. But these labels are applied inconsistently, depending on who is responsible for the violence.\n\n[Americans who live closer to a mass shooting are more likely to support gun regulation]\n\nOver the past decade, self-identified white supremacists have killed more Americans than Islamist militants. Yet a recent paper reveals that these attacks receive far less media attention than attacks by Muslims, contributing to the notion that Islamist terrorism is an existential threat while racist violence is a rare aberration. Some political leaders have fueled this narrative as well, by focusing on threats from foreigners rather than domestic extremists.\n\nCalling people who commit hate crimes, including self-declared white supremacists, terrorists would draw attention and, potentially, resources, to racist violence carried out in the name of an extremist ideology against groups such as Jews, African Americans, Sikhs, Muslims, immigrants, members of the LGBTQ+ community and others. Self-declared white supremacists want to turn the United States into a culturally exclusive society. In that way, they resemble groups like the Islamic State, which wants to construct a \u201cpure\u201d religious community, expelling or subjugating those who think or pray differently.\n\nTerrorism can be considered not just an objective fact but also a socially constructed reality, defined by the language and connotations embedded in the words used. White supremacy has a long and ugly history in the United States. Its extremist worldview also has the potential to inspire more attacks on large numbers of unarmed people.\n\nIdean Salehyan is a professor of political science at the University of North Texas.", "", "\n\nPresident Trump discusses politics with rapper Kanye West in the Oval Office. (Sebastian Smith/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIt is not uncommon to see celebrities wade into presidential elections. In 2016, both the Republican and Democratic nominees had surrogates from the entertainment industry stumping for them at rallies, on cable news and on the trail.\n\nBut there\u2019s a risk to latching your candidacy onto individuals known more for their ability to generate a following than their grasp of policy.\n\nPresident Trump discovered that this week.\n\nPerhaps no other demographic group gives Trump lower approval ratings than black voters. Support for the president from black Americans was already low before Trump called NFL players protesting racial injustice by kneeling during the anthem \u201csons of bitches\u201d and called the white supremacists marching to preserve memorials honoring Confederate soldiers who fought to keep black people enslaved \u201cvery fine people.\u201d\n\nBut black Americans' continued disinterest in the GOP appears to have perplexed Trump, who despite losing the black vote in 2016 won the election, in part, by playing into the fears of some white Americans who were culturally anxious about what a diversifying America would look like.\n\nSo if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things I have done, how do Democrats, who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK, win the Black Vote? And it will only get better! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2018\n\nBut with no black senior staffers in the White House and few pro-Trump black advocates on cable news, it\u2019s fair to guess that the president\u2019s grasp of the black electorate heading into the midterms isn\u2019t strong, or a priority. Trump, a big fan of both social media and entertainers, appears to have put some of his black-voter-outreach hopes into hip-hop artist Kanye West, whose tweets in support of Trump and rant in the White House last month have appeared to do very little to draw more black voters to the GOP.\n\nBut this week, West, feeling used by black conservatives, chose to distance himself from politics, a moment that Candace Owens, a black conservative, compared to a bullet piercing her heart.\n\nMy eyes are now wide open and now realize I\u2019ve been used to spread messages I don\u2019t believe in.

Abrams was joined by arguably one of the entertainment industry\u2019s most influential stars: Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThe former talk show host is, in part, credited with giving Barack Obama\u2019s candidacy a boost when she came out and endorsed the former Illinois lawmaker in his 2008 run for president. Winfrey, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential pursuits in 2016, is often floated as a potential contender for 2020, although she has repeatedly expressed disinterest in the position.\n\nWinfrey is nowhere near as polarizing as West, who managed to offend President George W. Bush when he accused him of not caring about black people, as well as Obama, who called him a \u201cjackass\u201d after West stole a moment from pop star Taylor Swift. Speaking of Swift, the singer notably launched her first big political advocacy effort this year by backing the Democrat in Tennessee\u2019s Senate race, the effectiveness of which is debatable, however, in a very red state.\n\nWhile associating with a celebrity could be off-putting to some in traditionally conservative Georgia, Abrams will probably be unscathed if she is not centering part of her voter outreach efforts on an individual\u2019s fame. Winfrey made a point to emphasize that she was in town not to talk about her -- or her political ambitions, but to discuss Abrams.\n\nOprah: I. Don\u2019t. Want. To. Run. OK?

He denied such claims repeatedly over the past several years,\u201d the family said. \u201cJamal Khashoggi was not a dangerous person in any way possible. To claim otherwise would be ridiculous.\u201d\n\nA person familiar with the discussion said Bolton did not signal that he endorsed the crown prince\u2019s characterization of Khashoggi during the call.\n\nA Saudi official denied Wednesday that the crown prince made the allegations, saying that \u201croutine calls do exist from time to time\u201d between the young leader and top U.S. officials but that \u201cno such commentary was conveyed.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia has faced international condemnation for its shifting accounts of Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe kingdom initially said Khashoggi walked out of the consulate unharmed but then said Saudi agents had accidentally killed him in a fistfight, and more recently announced that it had evidence that his killing was \u201cpremeditated.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the crown prince\u2019s efforts to discredit Khashoggi in private suggested a two-faced attempt at damage control.\n\n\u201cThis is character assassination added to premeditated murder,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official who is a scholar at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe White House declined to discuss sensitive conversations with the Saudis or say how many phone calls the crown prince and Kushner have had since Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. Mohammed has spoken to Kushner multiple times, according to people familiar with the matter, but the most recent call with Bolton and Kushner happened Oct. 9.\n\nOfficials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.\n\n[Crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is \u2018chief of the tribe\u2019 in a cowed House of Saud]\n\nOther Middle East leaders have come to the crown prince\u2019s defense. In recent days, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have reached out to the Trump administration to express support for the crown prince, arguing that he is an important strategic partner in the region, said people familiar with the calls.\n\nIsrael, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have united behind the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to bring pressure on Iran and force through a Middle East peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nOther U.S. allies, notably Germany, Britain and France, have voiced serious concern about what happened to Khashoggi, who wrote opinion articles critical of the Saudi leadership in The Washington Post.\n\nThe Trump administration revoked the visas or made travel ineligible for 21 Saudi nationals implicated by Turkey and Saudi Arabia in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nAs U.S. officials contemplate a more robust response, Kushner has emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Saudi alliance in the region, said people familiar with the conversations.\n\nOther officials at the State Department and Pentagon, however, have said the options under consideration could include a clear discipline of the Saudi government or a demand to end the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar or wind down the war in Yemen. Officials cautioned that no decision has been made, and Trump has expressed little desire to significantly alter U.S.-Saudi relations, but there is an interest in a full vetting of the potential options.\n\nKushner\u2019s efforts to carefully cultivate a relationship with the heir to the Saudi throne make him a critical voice in deciding the Trump administration\u2019s response. After several private talks early in the administration, Kushner championed Mohammed as a reformer poised to usher the ultraconservative, oil-rich monarchy into modernity. Kushner privately argued for months last year that Mohammed would be key to crafting a Middle East peace plan, and that with the prince\u2019s blessing, much of the Arab world would follow.\n\nIt was Kushner who pushed his father-in-law to make his first foreign trip as president to Riyadh, against objections from then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and warnings from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. In the early days of the administration, Kushner often preferred to talk to the crown prince privately but now coordinates his conversations with the National Security Council.\n\nKushner visited the crown prince at his palace in a secret October 2017 trip, a plan so closely held that it caught some White House and intelligence officials by surprise.\n\nThe two 30-somethings stayed up late into the evening alone discussing the prospects of Kushner\u2019s Middle East peace plan. A few days later, the prince ordered the house arrest of dozens of rival royals and imprisonment of other enemies in a bid to solidify his control of the government. The White House and the Saudis have denied Kushner approved the power grab.\n\nSaudi officials had made no secret of their antipathy toward Khashoggi, including expressing consternation last year when he began writing a regular column for The Post. In the days after his disappearance \u2014 before the Saudis acknowledged his death in Istanbul \u2014 a person close to the royal palace said Mohammed was puzzled by the high level of concern about Khashoggi, whom he considered part of the Muslim Brotherhood as well as an agent of Qatar.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s family said his views were much more nuanced than those described by Saudi officials. \u201cAlthough he sympathized with certain objectives of the Muslim Brotherhood, he also sharply disagreed with many of their positions, especially toward Saudi Arabia,\u201d the family said in its statement.\n\nSaudi Arabia severed relations with Qatar last year, charging among other things that it harbored Muslim Brotherhood \u201cterrorists.\u201d Although the Saudis maintained a cordial relationship with the Brotherhood for decades after its founding in Egypt as an Islamist political and social movement, Riyadh declared it a terrorist organization after the upheavals of the Arab Spring.\n\nMany Republican lawmakers and Middle East analysts on the right agreed with the Saudi assessment \u2014 in 2015, Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, now Trump\u2019s secretary of state, co-sponsored a resolution calling on the State Department to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. During Trump\u2019s campaign, several prominent supporters, including Bolton, called for such a designation.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Sissi, whose military government overthrew an elected Muslim Brotherhood-allied government in 2013, and Israel\u2019s political right share that view.\n\nTrump considered such an action early in his administration but was dissuaded by Pompeo, who had become CIA director, and others in the administration. They noted that while the designation would please some Arab partners, others in the region would reject it. The Brotherhood has mainstream political stature and legitimacy in Jordan, Turkey and Morocco, among other countries.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tay\u00adyip Erdogan, a rival of the Saudi crown prince, has called for Saudi Arabia to be held accountable for the killing.

Novara, his public defender, before Magistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell. Unlike a court appearance in front of Mitchell on Monday, when Bowers was seated in a wheelchair, he walked into this hearing, his hands shackled and a chain hanging off his waist. Bowers was hospitalized for two days after the shooting after being shot multiple times, but he has since been released and is in federal custody.\n\nDuring the hearing, Bowers sat slouched over the table, wearing a fixed somber expression while prosecutors listed the charges against him and reminded him that he could receive a death sentence if convicted. He also requested a jury trial. Novara, his public defender, had no comment Thursday.\n\nIn court documents, officials estimated Bowers\u2019s eventual trial could last between three and four weeks. A status conference in the case was scheduled for Dec. 11.\n\n[Suspect in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting is charged in 44-count hate-crime indictment]\n\nAmong the charges Bowers faces are 11 counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. The Justice Department has said federal prosecutors in Pittsburgh have begun the process of seeking a possible death sentence in the case; such decisions are made by the attorney general after a review by federal lawyers who specialize in capital cases. When the charges against Bowers were announced, Attorney General Jeff Sessions decried the \u201cincomprehensibly evil and utterly repugnant\u201d allegations laid out in the indictment.\n\nThe attack on the synagogue was the deadliest on Jews in American history. Among the victims were two brothers who had attended the services each week since their childhood, a doctor who led its Torah studies and a man who sat in the back and handed prayer books to people who arrived late.\n\n\n\nFlowers surround Stars of David on Wednesday, part of a makeshift memorial outside Tree of Life Synagogue to the 11 people killed during worship services Saturday in Pittsburgh.

Although no decision has been made on a possible death sentence, one of the factors federal prosecutors can cite in seeking such a penalty is whether victims are particularly old or young; six of the 11 victims at the synagogue were at least 70 or older.\n\nLocal prosecutors also have filed charges against Bowers, but Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. said this week that he will put that prosecution on hold while the federal case proceeds.

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nOctober was an \u201call of the above\u201d month offering everything from summery weather with high humidity to cool crisp nights with scattered frost.\n\nWashington\u2019s temperature range for the month was 52 degrees \u2014 from a high of 90 early in the month to a low of 38. We totaled nine days with highs in the 80s (or higher) and seven days with highs in the 50s. Unfortunately, the rarity of normal temperatures meant that if we weren\u2019t running our air conditioners, we were probably already turning on the heat.\n\nThe average temperature of 60.8 was 3.1 degrees above normal and the 16th warmest October on record. The rainfall total of 3.06 inches was just 0.34 below normal, which ranks as the 82nd driest of all-time and the 8th driest of the 2000s.\n\nOctober weather extremes and records\n\nWhile the temperature volatility was large, the rainfall was sparse compared to recent months. In fact, it was the first drier than normal month since March and measurable rain was logged on just nine days.\n\n\n\nOctober 2018 extremes in Washington.\n\nThe first half of the month will be recalled for its unusual warmth. Nine of the first 11 days were 80 degrees or warmer. During this warm spell, two records were tied:\n\nWashington:\n\nOct. 7: Record-warm low temperature of 71 tied 1941.\n\nDulles:\n\nOct. 3: Record high temperature of 86 tied 2007.\n\nBaltimore: None reported\n\nOctober weather pattern\n\nThe month was a tale of two seasons with a summery start and very autumnal second half.\n\nThe high altitude weather pattern in the first half of the month is shown below. High pressure was the dominant feature in the East which kept it warm.\n\n\n\nHigh altitude weather pattern, Oct 1-15, 2018.\n\nBut then the pattern flipped mid-month, as high pressure in the east was replaced by low pressure thanks to a giant high pressure ridge over Alaska, which forced the jet stream to dive south over the eastern United States.\n\n\n\nHigh altitude weather pattern, Oct 16-29, 2018.\n\nAveraging together the very warm pattern to start the month and the somewhat cool second half, and we ended up with temperatures averaging out slightly warmer than normal, as shown in the map below:\n\n\n\nSurface temperature difference from normal during October 2018.\n\nJanuary-through-October temperature and precipitation rankings\n\nOctober\u2019s warmer than normal outcome bumped 2018 from sixth place to fifth place among the warmest years on record since 2000:\n\n2018 remains the wettest year of the 2000s, but the slightly dry October tightened the gap with 2003, which is in second place:\n\nThe incoming El Ni\u00f1o should keep November and December on the wetter side to maintain 2018\u2032s wettest status, but 2003 was wetter than normal in both months too, so the two months may continue to run neck and neck.\n\nOctober forecast evaluation\n\nA month ago, just ahead of October\u2019s start, we made the following predictions:\n\nTemperatures: We predict temperatures to run near to above normal (if above normal, it will be for the sixth month in a row). The normal average temperature for October is 59.5 degrees, and we project that the temperature will average between 59 and 62.5 degrees. Rainfall: We predict precipitation to run near to above normal, in the range of three to six inches compared with the normal 3.4 inches. If we manage above normal rainfall, it will be for the seventh month in a row.\n\nHere is what happened:\n\nTemperature: 60.8 degrees \u2014 right inside the predicted range.\n\nRain: 3.06 inches.

If you decide on your capital city, we will act in accordance,\u201d he told Israel Hayom, a conservative newspaper, in his first foreign media interview since the election last weekend. \u201cWhen I was asked during the campaign if I\u2019ll do it when I was president, I said yes.\u201d\n\nIf Brazil were to move its embassy to Jerusalem, it would be following the policy of the Trump administration, which recognized Jerusalem as the Israeli capital last year and moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv in May.\n\nJerusalem is a contested city. Palestinians consider East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the capital of their future independent state; Palestinian officials have refused to engage with their U.S. counterparts since the U.S. Embassy move.\n\nOnly Guatemala and Paraguay have followed the U.S. lead (though Paraguay later reversed its decision). A number of countries, including Australia, have suggested they might move their embassy in the future, however.\n\nBrazil and Israel have a long diplomatic history dating to the very foundation of the state of Israel, and Brazil has a sizable population of Jews, many of whom descended from refugees from Europe in the mid-20th century.\n\nHowever, in more recent years, the two nations have had a sometimes-fraught relationship. In 2014, after Brazil condemned the \u201cdisproportionate\u201d use of force by Israel in the Gaza Strip and recalled its ambassador, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman called Brazil a \u201cdiplomatic dwarf\u201d and an \u201cirrelevant diplomatic partner.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro, a 27-year congressman with few legislative achievements who overcame chaos within Brazil\u2019s political establishment to win the presidency, will take office Jan. 1. He has indicated frequently that he hopes for a closer relationship with Israel.\n\nThe feeling may be mutual. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that he had congratulated Bolsonaro on his election victory. The Israeli leader is widely expected to attend Bolsonaro\u2019s inauguration next year. Bolsonaro is also expected to make Israel his first foreign trip.\n\nI spoke this evening with the president-elect of Brazil, @jairbolsonaro. I congratulated him on his victory.

We are waiting for his visit to Israel! \u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) October 29, 2018\n\nIn his interview with Israel Hayom, Bolsonaro pledged to support Israel on the international stage. \u201cRest assured that you can depend on our vote in the U.N. on almost all the issues having to do with Israel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also suggested he would shutter the Palestinian Embassy in Brasilia, the Brazilian capital. \u201cIt was built too close to the presidential palace,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cNo embassy can be so close to the presidential palace, so we intend to move it.\u201d\n\nThe Palestinian Embassy is less than two miles from Planalto Palace, Brazil\u2019s government headquarters. Under the government of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil recognized a sovereign Palestinian state \u2014 something Bolsonaro has previously suggested he is against, comparing it to negotiating with terrorists.\n\n\u201cPalestine first needs to be a state to have the right to an embassy,\u201d he told Israel Hayom.\n\nBolsonaro has been a polarizing figure at home and has a long history of controversial comments about gay people and women. He has frequently extolled the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil between 1964 and 1985. Many critics have suggested his country does not have the clout, however, to pursue the kind of aggressive foreign policy practiced by the United States under President Trump.\n\n\"It would be throwing away $6 billion per year in poultry sales to Arab countries,\u201d Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to Washington, said of the proposal to move the embassy in Israel, according to the Associated Press.\n\nRead more:\n\nKosovo says it would move its Israel embassy to Jerusalem \u2014 if it had one\n\nAs criticism of Israel mounts, Guatemala opens its embassy in Jerusalem\n\nWho is Jair Bolsonaro?", "A protester holds a sign bearing a caricature of then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak during a 2016 rally calling for his resignation in Kuala Lumpur.

Franklin/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nBetween now and Tuesday, it is always possible that a specific event \u2014 a gaffe, a bombshell story, etc. \u2014 could shift the political terrain. (You might recall that President George W. Bush\u2019s drunken-driving incident was revealed the week before the 2000 election and might have depressed his vote, setting the stage for the Florida hanging-chad fight.) However, for all intents and purposes, few people will change their minds between now and Tuesday. Only the turnout matters.\n\n\u201cOnly\u201d in this case means an awful lot. An array of polls shows a batch of Senate races that are tied or within the margin of error (i.e. statistically tied). They could all fall one way or the other, or neatly split. For that reason, I find confidence that Republicans will expand their caucus misplaced. If Democratic voters are as enthusiastic as the party says they are, Democrats could stay even (at 51-49) or even gain a seat or two.\n\nIf you squint, you might see a slight swing toward Democrats in these close races down the stretch. NBC News reports: \u201cFueled by advantages among Latinos, independents and women, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema holds a 6-point lead over Republican Martha McSally in Arizona\u2019s key Senate contest, according to a new NBC News/Marist poll of the state. \u2026 In September\u2019s NBC/Marist poll, Sinema\u2019s lead over McSally was 3 points in this head-to-head contest, 48 percent to 45 percent.\u201d Likewise, the two most recent polls in the Senate race in Indiana show Joe Donnelly up by 7 points (Fox) and 3 points (NBC News-Marist). Democrats are also hoping that Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), leading narrowly in recent polls, gets a lift from Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor.\n\nThat said, neither side should be confident about the Senate. Republicans touted a bump from the Brett Kavanaugh hearings so often and so loudly that the media simply repeated it. However, across the board, polls show that Kavanaugh is widely unpopular and majorities believed Christine Blasey Ford. Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress writes:\n\nWhile some in the GOP base may indeed \u201ccome home\u201d and turn out as a result of the Kavanaugh fight, a recent USA Today poll indicates anti-Kavanaugh voters are the larger energized group. And I firmly believe that an overwhelming number of Americans galvanized by his confirmation will be people like me: People who will become deeply involved in politics for the first time \u2014 just like I did back in the fall of 1991. These new activists won\u2019t stop at simply casting a ballot. They will do whatever else it takes, from volunteering for phone banks to knocking on doors and donating to candidates all across the country. And they will stay engaged well after these midterms.\n\nWe will see on Tuesday if Kavanaugh hurt or helped Republicans \u2014 or if it was a wash. A large turnout by college-educated and/or suburban women that lifts Democrats to victory in close races might suggest a Kavanaugh backlash.\n\nFinally, the conventional wisdom that the House and Senate races were moving in opposite directions (i.e. House going Republican and Senate going Democratic) really isn\u2019t born out by polls. The Democrats started with a huge disadvantage defending 26 seats, many in red states. Right now, the only Democrat clearly in trouble is Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. Democrats seem poised to reestablish dominance in the Midwest and Rust Belt by retaining Senate seats in Minnesota, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Nonetheless, the refugees were allowed to stay. Later in the decade, hundreds of thousands of people living in Vietnam (including many ethnic Chinese) began leaving the country in overcrowded boats. At the same time, thousands of Cambodians and Laotians were escaping their countries over land. In response to the humanitarian crisis, President Jimmy Carter in June 1979 doubled the number of Indochinese refugees the U.S. had previously agreed to accept, to 14,000 a month. The move was not popular: In a CBS News/New York Times poll the following month, 62% disapproved of Carter\u2019s action. But between 1980 and 1990, according to federal immigration data compiled by Pew Research Center, nearly 590,000 refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were admitted into the U.S.\n\nBy 2017, more than 1.3 million Vietnamese lived in the United States. Now, people whom Trump and his ilk surely would have wanted to keep out \u201chave higher incomes compared to the total foreign- and native-born populations. In 2017, households headed by a Vietnamese immigrant had a median income of approximately $63,200, compared to $56,700 and $60,800 for all immigrant and U.S.-born households, respectively.\u201d It was a good thing we didn\u2019t send a small army to keep out people fleeing communism who would become productive, loyal Americans.\n\nTrump\u2019s war against a nonexistent threat is so preposterous, and is such an obvious misuse of taxpayer dollars and an abuse of the military, that one wonders whether Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant hysteria has reached the point of diminishing returns. The higher the already ludicrous number of deployed troops becomes, the more apparent his desperation becomes and the more people outside his core of xenophobic fans might conclude that we really do need Democrats in majorities in the House and Senate to head off this lunacy.\n\nTrump\u2019s insistence on demagoguing the issue \u2014 which was the impetus for the mail bomber and set off a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue \u2014 underscores the degree to which his party has become an irrational nativist movement. Rule of law (the old excuse for opposing \u201camnesty\u201d for those here illegally)? Meh. An executive order will rewrite the Constitution to strip those born in this country of their U.S. citizenship. Market economics? Nah. It\u2019s a Malthusian world in which each new person snatches resources and jobs from those already here.\n\nIf you want to know why the Republican Party has repulsed so many former adherents, you need look no further than its xenophobic delusions which waste money, abuse the military, incite racism and violence, work to our economic disadvantage and violate our deepest held values.", "\n\nWes Robinson, left, prepares Maryland quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome for therapy in the sports medicine clinic in February. (Photo by Doug Kapustin for The Washington Post)\n\nThe University System of Maryland Board of Regents recommended this week that the College Park campus retain the athletic trainers who have drawn the bulk of the blame for failing to properly treat Jordan McNair during a May workout, according to two people familiar with the situation.\n\nMcNair suffered from exertional heatstroke during team sprints and died 15 days later. An independent report into the circumstances surrounding his death outlined numerous missteps that were made by the school\u2019s athletic trainers along the way, and the university has accepted responsibility for mistakes made by the school employees.\n\nDespite this, the regents encouraged the school to reinstate Steve Nordwall, assistant athletic director of athletic training, and Wes Robinson, the head trainer for the football program. Nordwall and Robinson have been on paid administrative leave since Aug. 10.\n\nOne person familiar with the situation stressed that the university has not acted on the regents\u2019 recommendation. A university spokeswoman declined to comment on the regents\u2019 actions, and a spokesman for the university system did not immediately respond to a request to comment Thursday.\n\nAsked about the status of the trainers during a news conference Tuesday in Baltimore, school President Wallace D. Loh said: \u201cThe athletic director is responsible for all of the staff, coaches and other staff, in the athletic department. He will make that decision.\u201d\n\n[Barry Svrluga: Maryland rights a wrong \u2014 but it remains a long way from being out of the woods]\n\nThe regents have drawn heavy criticism this week for their handling of the investigation and their recommendations to the University of Maryland. The board urged Loh to allow football coach DJ Durkin to return to the sidelines. Two people familiar with the proceedings have said that Loh faced the threat of termination if he didn\u2019t follow through on the board\u2019s wishes.\n\nLoh initially did, and Durkin rejoined the team Tuesday afternoon and attended two practices with players. But pressure mounted Wednesday from state politicians and the university community, and Loh decided to fire Durkin immediately.\n\nWhile Durkin\u2019s status with the program has been debated in College Park and beyond since he was placed on leave Aug. 11, there\u2019s been less public discussion surrounding the athletic trainers.\n\nThe university contracted with Walters Inc., an athletic training consulting firm, in June to investigate the events surrounding McNair\u2019s death. After receiving preliminary results of that probe, Loh said at a news conference Aug. 14 that the trainers failed to diagnose McNair with heatstroke and thus failed to properly treat him.\n\nThe 74-page Walters' report was released publicly and shared with the board Sept. 21. It found that more than an hour passed between the time McNair began experiencing symptoms of heatstroke and when school officials called 911 to report a medical emergency.\n\nThe report cited eyewitness accounts, and one player told investigators that when McNair was clearly struggling, Robinson yelled, \u201cGet him the \u2018f---\u2019 up.\u201d Another player said Robinson yelled, \u201cDrag his ass off the field.\u201d\n\nMcNair wasn\u2019t aboard an ambulance until 94 minutes after he began experiencing heatstroke symptoms. According to hospital records, he arrived with a temperature that had reached 106 degrees.\n\nMedical experts have said that patients have a 100-percent survival rate when heatstroke is treated promptly. According to hospital records, McNair\u2019s temperature wasn\u2019t lowered to 102, which is considered a much safer temperature, until nearly 2\u00bd hours after he began experiencing symptoms.\n\nRoman Stubbs contributed to this report.\n\nRead more Maryland football coverage:\n\nDJ Durkin, Maryland part ways following outcry over coach\u2019s reinstatement\n\nA timeline of events at the University of Maryland in Jordan McNair saga\n\nMaryland football players react to DJ Durkin\u2019s departure: \u2018Pressure busts pipes doesn\u2019t it??\u2019\n\nMaryland players involved in altercation amid turmoil in College Park", "", "The 1988 \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad remains the most infamous political ad in modern American history. But no one was particularly proud of being associated with it. The ad was meant to help George H.W. Bush defeat Michael Dukakis, but it was run by a shady political action committee separate from the Bush campaign. The campaign itself treated the whole thing cautiously for weeks but eventually denounced the ad. The man behind the ad, notorious bare-knuckle political consultant Lee Atwater, initially denied any involvement and later expressed regrets when he was dying of cancer. Even Roger Stone, another bare-knuckler if there ever was one, says he told Atwater at the time that the ad was \u201cracist\u201d and that Atwater and Bush would \u201cwear that to your grave.\u201d\n\nA new ad tweeted by President Trump on Wednesday night has quickly drawn very valid comparisons to the Horton ad. But what might be most noteworthy about it is how willingly Trump is attaching his name to the racially charged, Horton-esque message.\n\nAnd it follows an increasing trend of rather shameless misrepresentations and even dog whistles that GOP candidates and the party as a whole seem only too happy to associate themselves with \u2014 as if they\u2019ve recognized Trump\u2019s success with this approach and have decided they might as well do it themselves and own it.\n\n(The video below contains graphic language.)\n\nIt is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now! https://t.co/0pWiwCHGbh pic.twitter.com/2crea9HF7G \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2018\n\nThe parallels between the two ads are pretty stark. The Horton ad blamed Dukakis for Horton, a convicted killer who was on furlough, going on to commit rape, assault and armed robbery. Pictures of the black man featured prominently, including a mug shot.\n\nTrump\u2019s ad features Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported Mexican immigrant in the country illegally who murdered two law enforcement officers. In clips from his trial shown in the ad, Bracamontes says he aimed to kill more cops and wished he had. \u201cDemocrats let him stay,\u201d reads the text in the middle of the screen after his courtroom outburst. It adds later, \u201cWho else would Democrats let in?\u201d\n\nJust as the Horton ad seemed a blatant effort to play on racial fears of a black man being allowed by Democrats to go on a crime rampage, the Trump ad suggests that Democrats want to allow Hispanic immigrants in the country illegally to do the same. This is hardly a new tack for Trump \u2014 he made crime by those in the country illegally a central plank of his 2016 campaign and has recently said, baselessly, that Democrats \u201cwant to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs\u201d \u2014 but the ad represents perhaps his most forceful dog whistle yet.\n\nLike the Horton ad, it\u2019s built on a rocky foundation. Dukakis\u2019s state, Massachusetts, was hardly alone in employing a furlough program \u2014 even the federal government had one \u2014 and the program actually started under his GOP predecessor. The idea that Dukakis was personally responsible was a huge stretch. In the case of Bracamontes, the argument seems to be that Democrats are weaker on illegal immigration, and thus people like Bracamontes feel more comfortable reentering the country after being deported. But you can\u2019t draw a specific line between any Democratic policy and what Bracamontes did.\n\nThe ad contributes to an increasing shamelessness in our political ads and strategies that started in 2016 and metastasized this year \u2014 mostly from Republicans. In recent days, mailers have featured a Jewish candidate in Connecticut gripping cash and grinning (eventually the GOP disavowed it). A number of ads have featured what many view as coded messages about race and gender, labeling a female candidate a \u201cfeminist,\u201d saddling a black Rhodes Scholar with his former rap career, and suggesting a candidate of Indian and Tibetan descent was \u201cselling out Americans.\u201d\n\nGOP candidates have blatantly misrepresented fact checks by The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker, awarding \u201cFour Pinnochios\u201d to candidates who hadn\u2019t actually received them. An outside group tweeted an ad just this week featuring a Democrat who served three tours with the CIA in Iraq saying she favored \u201cparty over country,\u201d even though it was just a verbal slip-up and she had run her campaign on a \u201ccountry first\u201d message.\n\nLying about Pinocchio ratings is all the rage these days for a bunch of Rs. It can't be a coincidence. Someone came up with this idea. Something to think about. https://t.co/bmryNt58hw \u2014 Sal Rizzo (@rizzoTK) November 1, 2018\n\nThere seems to be a growing sense that accuracy and delicacy, particularly on sensitive issues of race and culture, are hindrances and that there is no real price to be paid for straddling or stepping over the line. While campaigns have usually hidden behind outside groups who run these kinds of ads \u2014 or rely upon anonymous ne\u2019er-do-wells for their dirty tricks \u2014 it\u2019s now out in the open.\n\nAnd you can understand why, based upon Trump\u2019s success with just such a message. But the fact that Republicans \u2014 a party that after the 2012 election talked a good game about diversifying their party and appealing to minorities \u2014 seem to have abandoned any pretense about these matters suggests our politics are only going to get uglier.", "", "Opinion writer\n\nIt is no longer an open question: President Trump knows full well that his rhetoric and conspiracy theories are putting people\u2019s lives in danger \u2014 and in one case might have already helped incite mass murder \u2014 yet he continues to push them anyway.\n\nAxios just posted a new exchange from an interview with Trump that is set to air this weekend. You should watch the video. It is profoundly awful to witness Trump blithely shrug at his own role in inciting violent behavior and more broadly at the deep damage he is doing to this country. Here\u2019s the exchange, with reporter Jim VandeHei:\n\nVandeHei: To be honest, what scares the crap out of me is that when, if you\u2019re saying, \u201cenemy of the people, enemy of the people\u201d \u2014 Trump: Well I have to fight back. You\u2019re right \u2014 VandeHei: Hold on a second. God forbid that like somebody \u2014 you\u2019ve got fervent supporters. They love you. Listen to you. \u201cEnemy of the people\u201d \u2014 Trump: They like me more because of that. VandeHei: They like you more, but what happens if all of a sudden someone gets shot? Someone shoots one of these reporters? Trump: I fully \u2014 VandeHei: You don\u2019t think we\u2019re the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d do you? Trump: I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t. But if you gave me false reports, I would say that\u2019s not a good thing for our country. VandeHei: But don\u2019t you worry at all? You are like the most powerful man in the world. And if you say that word, \u201cenemy, enemy, enemy\u201d \u2014 literally tens of thousands of people go into a stadium to listen to you. And then people go on social media and get themselves so jazzed up. There\u2019s gotta be a part of you that\u2019s like, \u201cdamn, I\u2019m scared that someone is going to take it too far.\u201d Trump: Jim, it\u2019s my only form of fighting back. I couldn\u2019t be here if I did that. VandeHei: You won! You have the presidency! Trump: No, no, no. But I did this before I won.\n\nAgain, watch the video. When Trump is asked by a visibly worried fellow human being to display awareness of the dangerous impact his own actions and rhetoric have on others \u2014 when he is asked to show a conscience about this \u2014 Trump visibly chafes. He can only process and respond to the question by flipping into a mode in which all that matters is how his conduct makes his supporters like him more and about how it is absolutely justified as a response to the way he is treated.\n\nThe impact that Trump\u2019s wielding of the power and megaphone of the presidency is having on others \u2014 and on the country he leads \u2014 is, for Trump, simply not worth addressing for a passing second. Perhaps he is incapable of addressing it. Trump responds thusly not once, not twice, but three times.\n\nPerhaps you think this merely represents Trump digging in and refusing to cave to a reporter, because (as he put it) this makes his supporters \u201clike me more.\u201d But this would not be mitigating in the least.\n\nWe already know Trump\u2019s rhetoric is driving people toward violence\n\nHere\u2019s why: We already have direct confirmation that Trump\u2019s \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric may, in fact, be inspiring real people to actively consider murdering reporters.\n\nA few weeks ago, Robert D. Chain was arrested for allegedly threatening to murder journalists at the Boston Globe \u2014 while mimicking Trump\u2019s language. According to FBI documents, Chain allegedly snarled into one employee\u2019s voicemail: \u201cYou\u2019re the enemy of the people, and we\u2019re going to kill every f\u2013\u2013\u2013ing one of you.\u201d\n\nTrump has kept on repeating this very same \u201cenemy of the people\u201d language after that happened. This is the context for understanding Trump\u2019s new comments to Axios: Trump has seen actual evidence that people appear to be contemplating acting on his rhetoric with murderous intent. Yet he defends it on the grounds that it is a justifiable response to aggressive media scrutiny of him and his administration \u2014 which is what the press is supposed to be doing \u2014 and even confirms he keeps this up anyway because it tightens his bond with his supporters.\n\nIf this is true, which it appears to be, what does that say about his supporters?\n\nTrump keeps feeding conspiracy theories after they incite violent behavior and murder\n\nBefore departing on a final campaign swing Wednesday afternoon, Trump was asked by reporters whether he stands by the suggestion that the \u201ccaravan\u201d of migrants moving through Mexico is orchestrated. Trump fed the conspiracy theory that George Soros is behind it:\n\nQuestion: Do you think somebody is funding the caravan? Do you think somebody is paying for the caravan? Trump: I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Question: George Soros? Who\u2019s paying for it? Trump: I don\u2019t know who. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. A lot of people say yes.\n\nThe man who allegedly gunned down 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue did so after unleashing deranged rants to the effect that Jews \u201cbring in invaders\u201d \u2014 that is, refugees \u2014 who \u201ckill our people.\u201d This is a standard white-nationalist trope, which imagines a conspiracy in which \u201cglobalists\u201d (read: Jews) are engineering a demographic invasion of the United States, to racially infect and undermine the \u201creal\u201d American people. Trump himself has used the \u201cglobalists\u201d language while hate-mongering about the Central American migrants and casting them as a national emergency in veiled white-nationalist terms.\n\nRecently, a man with a van covered in pro-Trump stickers allegedly tried to murder Soros with a pipe bomb mailed to his home, along with the homes of many prominent Democrats. Now Trump is again feeding the Soros-is-orchestrating-the-migrants conspiracy theory. Multiple Republicans continue to do the same.\n\nChain, the man who allegedly threatened to murder journalists, didn\u2019t merely agree with Trump that they are the \u201cenemy.\u201d He also trafficked in a Trumpian conspiracy theory. He allegedly told a newsroom employee: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call Mueller, maybe he can help you out.\u201d In this, Chain indulged the theory that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is conspiring with the media against Trump. After the news broke about this, Trump strode forth at a rally and repeated a version of this very same conspiracy theory.\n\nTrump knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. It isn\u2019t just that he is actively, concertedly and deliberately inciting civil conflict on as many fronts as possible. Nor is it just that he does this precisely because (as he again confirmed to Axios) that he believes his supporters thrill to it, the damage to the country be damned, as independent reporting has verified again and again.\n\nIt\u2019s also that Trump does all of this in the full knowledge that it not only might, but likely already has, inspired one madman to seriously consider murdering multiple journalists, and probably helped feed a climate of hate that apparently pushed two other madmen to actually attempt to carry out mass murder, one of whom succeeded.", "Reporter\n\nThe holidays just got real. And no, I\u2019m not talking about Santa Claus.\n\nIn a season when cinemas are typically larded with escapist goodies like \u201cAquaman,\u201d \u201cDr. Seuss\u2019s The Grinch,\u201d \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d and \u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d this year is notable for the way the culture wars have invaded the silver screen.\n\nAnd yes, I know that lately it seems every movie is political, especially at this time on the calendar, when Hollywood\u2019s weightiest, most issue-oriented dramas vie for Oscar\u2019s attention.

This is a film that could turn traditional notions of gender and gender expression on their heads: It not only features several strong female characters, but there is also a hidden subtext, glossed over in the film\u2019s trailers but prominent in the 2010 documentary, of a gender-based hate crime.

(AP Photo/Mike McCarn) (Mike Mccarn/AP)\n\nThe Carolina Panthers are 4-0 at home after dispatching the Baltimore Ravens 36-21 last week. Quarterback Cam Newton threw for 219 yards and two touchdowns against the Ravens on Sunday and added 52 yards and a score on the ground as well.\n\nTampa Bay, meanwhile, is making a change under center: Buccaneers head coach Dirk Koetter has named Ryan Fitzpatrick his starter for Week 9 after Fitzpatrick completed 11 of 15 pass attempts for 194 yards and two touchdowns in relief of Jameis Winston last week against the Cincinnati Bengals. Winston was benched after he threw his fourth interception of the day.\n\n[Fantasy Football start/sit tips Week 9: Adrian Peterson won\u2019t slow down against the Falcons]\n\nCarolina Panthers, 71 percent win probability\n\nFitzpatrick started Tampa Bay\u2019s first three games of 2018 while Winston served a three-game suspension, passing for at least 400 yards and three touchdowns in each contest. However, Carolina\u2019s defense is holding opponents to a below-average 90.4 passer rating in 2018 and that includes perhaps their best performance of the season this past week, holding the Baltimore Ravens to 224 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions (70.1 rating, lowest of the week).\n\nAgainst No. 1 receiver types like Mike Evans the Panthers rank fourth-best per Football Outsiders' Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, a metric that measures a team\u2019s efficiency by comparing success on every single play to a league average based on situation and opponent. Odell Beckham Jr. had a big day against Carolina\u2019s secondary, 131 yards and a score, but Atlanta\u2019s Julio Jones was held to 64 yards and no touchdowns and A.J. Green had 58 yards and no touchdowns.\n\n\n\nCarolina interception (none)\n\nCarolina\u2019s secondary also has four interceptions on deep throws (20 or more yards) this season, tied for the second-most in the NFL and particularity useful against a speedy deep threat like DeSean Jackson.\n\nTampa Bay also has one of the worst run-blocking units in the NFL. The Bucs' offensive line has allowed their rushers to be stopped at or behind the line of scrimmage 28 percent of the time, the second-worst in the NFL. Only the Atlanta Falcons have struggled more at the line of scrimmage (29 percent).\n\n\n\nHighest stuff rate allowed by O-line in 2018 (none)\n\nThe Panthers are not a perfect team, of course, but they do have talent on both sides of the ball. Newton is a dual-threat quarterback who can rush for a touchdown (four in 2018; 58 since 2011) almost as easily as he can throw one. And pass-catching running back Christian McCaffrey offers similar versatility out of the backfield.\n\nAdd in the emergence of D.J. Moore \u2014 he caught 5 of 6 targets for 90 yards against the Ravens on Sunday \u2014 and Carolina offers a match up problem at every skill position for a Tampa Bay team whose defense ranks 31st per Pro Football Focus and last per Football Outsiders with the most turnovers (19) by an offense this season.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nWeek 9 NFL betting tips: Why the Seahawks may be worth a Super Bowl futures wager\n\nRedskins trade for safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, send a fourth-round pick to Packer\n\nRutgers football player arrested on charges of attempted double-murder\n\nMaryland regents side with football Coach DJ Durkin over recommendation of President Wallace Loh, who will retire next year\n\nAlabama, Clemson take usual places atop College Football Playoff rankings, but it gets fun after that\n\nUrban Meyer coping with pain from brain cyst but intends to keep coaching Ohio State", "", "", "", "\n\nFans walk outsideCanvas Stadium in Fort Collins, Colo., before the annual rivalry game between Colorado State and Wyoming for the Golden Boot Trophy.

Troy played South Alabama in one of those funky Tuesday concoctions of football and television, of the trade-off between television attention and sparse crowds. Troy brought about a dozen busloads of mostly students the 144 miles from one Sun Belt Conference rival to another, and filled one end zone with the verve generally found in 38-17 road wins. The crowd thinned from its original 25,878. Kids leaned over the front-row railing and chatted up South Alabama\u2019s Jaguar mascot.\n\nTroy toiled in Division II in 1990, went I-AA in 1991 and to the top division in 2001. South Alabama\u2019s first season was 2009. They have played each other seven times so far as they aim to construct a future. Troy\u2019s roster teems with 59 Alabamians, South Alabama\u2019s with 56, and Mobile itself teems with talent, its citizens often able to reel off lists of those raised in the area and employed in the NFL.\n\nIt\u2019s the state of Alabama, so these second-tier dreamers dwell in the unforgiving umbra of Alabama-Auburn.\n\n[Alabama, Clemson take usual places atop College Football Playoff rankings, but it gets fun after that]\n\n\u201cOlder Troy fans probably did pull for Alabama or Auburn and then Troy, because we weren\u2019t playing at the same level,\u201d Troy Athletic Director Jeremy McClain said. \u201cOur younger fans don\u2019t feel the same way about that.

Four days later, the campus was still celebrating. (Thomas J. Russo/USA Today Sports)\n\nRenewed passion at Purdue\n\nLong since entrenched and cemented have been the identities of Ohio State and Purdue, so when one smashed the other, 49-20, on Oct. 20, and when it wasn\u2019t the usual one doing the smashing, the night emblazoned itself upon Purdue brains. When that same night managed to add the presence in the stadium of Tyler Trent, the newly famous 20-year-old Purdue student stricken with cancer while winning with spirit, the night blossomed further still. When an entire stadium chanted, \u201cCancer Sucks\u201d in support of Trent in his wheelchair, literally the entire world could have understood.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think it could get any better, and it kept getting better,\u201d said Rebecca Schneider, the sports editor of the Purdue Exponent, which has counted Trent as a sportswriter. \u201cAnd then he [Trent] was in the postgame, and I turned around and I saw [quarterback] David Blough, in the back. And I saw him, and when he saw Tyler he just had the biggest smile on his face, and . . . he went up and spoke to him, and it was like, \u2018We just beat Ohio State, and this is still getting better.\u2019 It was just unbelievable. I don\u2019t think there will ever be a more perfect night of sports, of Purdue football, or Purdue in general.\u201d\n\n[Feinstein: For Purdue, the \u2018cradle of astronauts,\u2019 a football win over Ohio State feels like one giant leap]\n\nThey had just felt something rarefied, something about human collaboration, something that would permeate the Purdue campus for days even if Purdue isn\u2019t showy, so a Wednesday evening on campus seemed like a Wednesday evening on campus, with no outward expressions of 49-20. But it lurked in giddy minds. Professors put on projectors the Purdue Exponent with its headline, \u201cNo. 2 Who?\u201d (a reference to Ohio State\u2019s ranking). Banks, that rare president-quarterback-engineering student, reported \u201cdefinitely a rush of emotion that I haven\u2019t felt before.\u201d\n\nMemory banks had gone brimming, until Schneider, whose feelings for her school exceed adoration, recalled being on the field afterward and \u201cbeing pushed, and not being able to control my body,\u201d and said, \u201cI\u2019ll always know that feeling,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019ll never forget how that night looked, and how it felt,\u201d and everyone knew football still could pull off all of the above.\n\n\n\nDavid Sills V, a quarterback turned standout wide receiver in his second stint at West Virginia, stretches for a pass from fellow transfer Will Grier.

They have intersected where the people make a compelling croon of John Denver\u2019s \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads,\u201d but Grier started out at Florida until that didn\u2019t work out and had him joining the fashion of transferring quarterbacks, while Sills crafted a story preposterously impressive.\n\nHe first gained notice as a 13-year-old quarterback, when Southern California Coach Lane Kiffin offered him a scholarship and loosed the requisite national yammering. Dreaming of quarterbacking and working at same, he went from high school in Elkton, Md., to West Virginia to El Camino College in Torrance, Calif., and back to West Virginia. When that quarterbacking dream finally stilled, he reinvented himself and his 6-foot-4 frame as a celestial receiver probably bound for the 2019 NFL season. Good grief.\n\nIt has become an understandable matter of normalcy in Morgantown while remaining incredible, but within 23 games, Still has reached 29 touchdowns, tied with Tavon Austin of the Dallas Cowboys for second most in program history. So on a Thursday night in Morgantown, it\u2019s an emblem of the drive and ingenuity of football players that this one-time 13-year-old lightning rod sits between reporters, saying comfortably:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling than when you score and the other 10 players on the offense are running down full speed with their arms wide open, ready to pick you up, ready to jump with you. And then you look over to the sideline and all the coaches, they\u2019re 10 yards off the sideline, and stuff like that, because they\u2019re excited for us, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nErik Mohr tailgates before the Wyoming-Colorado State game.

A batch of six or eight Colorado State fans, parents, spent part of Thursday evening discussing the matters.\n\nFootball \u201cteaches you a lot, just how to be a person and how to deal with yourself,\u201d said one of those parents, Josh Quinn, a Colorado State tight end from 1993 to \u201995. \u201cBut the state of the game, long-term, yeah, I mean, if we can make it safer, let\u2019s do it. I don\u2019t think the quality of the game has necessarily gone down. But how do you penalize? It seems like they haven\u2019t figured out\u201d when \u201csomebody\u2019s trying to hurt somebody, or somebody\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nSo the game dwells in a phase of adjustment. \u201cBut I think long-term, it\u2019s going to be a cleaner-quality game,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the game is going to disappear.

She implored the audience to refrain from using the lazy terminology of the word \u201ccrazy.\u201d She mentioned twice the term \u201cbipolar schizophrenic affective disorder.\u201d She told of his telling of eight concussions.

Keith told of a recent time in Palm Springs when, during a game of Cornhole, the old Kevin returned. \u201cIt only lasted, like, 20 minutes,\u201d Keith Ellison said.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nSince President Trump came into office, touting his Muslim ban, his focus when it comes to terrorism has been on Islamic terrorists outside the United States. Until very recently that\u2019s just about all the administration addressed. Even when the terrorist was a longtime American resident, as was the New York truck bomber who drove his truck into a pedestrian footpath killing eight people on Oct. 31, 2017, Trump has used terror as a pretext to change immigration laws, end the visa lottery system, deny refugees entry and now deploy troops to the border. The result is an atmosphere of xenophobia and conspiracy theories that disturbed figures will act upon, although that is plainly one result.\n\nIn January, Lawfare bloggers recounted:\n\nLast February [2017], President Trump claimed during an address to a joint session of Congress that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since Sept. 11, 2001, were foreign-born, and he attributed this claim to the Justice Department; \u201caccording to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country,\u201d he said. We were suspicious of this claim, so [Nora] Ellingsen and [Lisa] Daniels dug into the data. They discovered that the publicly available Justice Department data simply did not show that a majority of terrorist or terrorist-related crimes were committed by people who came from abroad. For one thing, this data set does not include domestic terrorism convictions. That is, it does not capture domestic terrorism subjects, who are more likely to be white and natural-born U.S. citizens. Leaving out those convictions is a big mistake. Last year, when Ellingsen and Daniels wrote about President Trump\u2019s executive order, they found that 1,306 defendants had been convicted of domestic terrorism offenses in the U.S. since 1996. That\u2019s more than twice the number of international terrorism convictions during the same period.\n\nTrump repeated his specious claim last January:\n\n....we need to keep America safe, including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-based. https://t.co/7PtoSFK1n2 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2018\n\nThis was false. The report did not say this.\n\nHe\u2019s now on the verge of canceling the Countering Violent Extremism Grant Program, which aims to prevent domestic terrorism. Interestingly, earlier this month the administration did release a \u201cNational Strategy for Counterterrorism,\u201d which represented a change of approach, albeit after two years of largely ignoring domestic terrorism. \u201cWe will also confront the threat of terrorists in the United States who seek to further their political or social aims through unlawful acts of violence without foreign direction or inspiration,\u201d the report noted. The vast majority of the report still focused on Islamic terrorism threats, but it at least included this:\n\nLastly, the United States has long faced a persistent security threat from domestic terrorists who are not motivated by a radical Islamist ideology but are instead motivated by other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism. Such extremist groups attempt to advance their agendas through acts of force or violence. Notably, domestic terrorism in the United States is on the rise, with an increasing number of fatalities and violent nonlethal acts committed by domestic terrorists against people and property in the United States.\n\nThe report was short on specifics, but there did seem to be some recognition that while Trump continued to obsess about yesterday\u2019s threats, domestic terrorism was growing. (Throwing in a grab-bag of ideologies with white nationalist terrorism, however, suggests a decided lack of seriousness about the latter.)\n\n\u201cToday, Americans are more likely to be killed by their fellow Americans than jihadists,\u201d former special FBI agent Clint Watts tells me. \u201cAnd yet, we treat each incident as a one off, when they are connected by ideologies of hate and white nationalism.\u201d He adds, \u201cThe President has the power to mobilize on domestic extremists, but he does not and instead ignores the gravity of the situation. As he doesn\u2019t seek to protect all Americans, just all of his supporters.\u201d One might even conclude that Trump\u2019s own rhetoric and hysteria over immigration fuels domestic terrorists\u2019 anger and gives nonviolent racists license to spout hate.\n\nWell, perhaps once the election is over and Trump is done promising to deploy thousands of troops to \u201cprotect\u201d us against unarmed women and children hundreds of miles away, he and the new Congress can start devoting some resources and attention to domestic terror. It might start with hearings and a report on the connection between racist ideology/rhetoric and action. Trump, it seems, has been chasing the wrong or at least less serious threats for political reasons while providing inspiration and cover for domestic actors who share his anti-immigrant, nationalist agenda.", "Felicia Davis has been on the front lines of countless political battles over the past few decades, but none has filled her with as much hope as Stacey Abrams\u2019s campaign to become the governor of Georgia.\n\nInside a one-story office building that showed little sign of life from the street, about two dozen volunteers, most of them black women, dialed up voters, imploring them to take part in an election that could make Abrams the nation\u2019s first black female governor.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to make history,\u201d Davis said as she and other activists reviewed plans to persuade black Georgians to vote. \u201cThis is more important than Obama.\u201d\n\nDavis was not playing down the significance of the country\u2019s first African American president.

Even a small percentage of votes to a third-party candidate could throw the race forward to then.\n\nIf Abrams wins, credit will flow in a major way to black women, who number nearly 1.1 million on the voter rolls.\n\n\n\nSupporters listen to Democrtic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in an event at Fort Valley State University in Fort Valley, Ga., on Oct. 15, 2018. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nFor decades, black women have been among the most politically active groups in the country, responsible for the Democratic Party\u2019s bragging rights to the \u201cwomen\u2019s vote\u201d in presidential and statewide races. In Obama\u2019s two elections in 2008 and 2012, black women voted at a higher rate than any demographic group.\n\nHillary Clinton claimed 94 percent of black women\u2019s votes in 2016, while 52 percent of white women backed Donald Trump. Strong turnout by black women helped Democrats win the past two governor\u2019s races in Virginia, and last year, black women were credited with nudging Doug Jones over the finish line in a close special election for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama against Republican Roy Moore.\n\nBlack women in Georgia have been busy in their neighborhoods, hosting events to register and rally voters. During the primary, groups of black women from across the country descended on Georgia to help with get-out-the-vote efforts. Another influx of volunteers is expected in the next several days.\n\nChristina Greer, a political-science professor at Fordham University, said that after keeping faith with the Democratic Party for so long, \u201cblack women feel like our time has come and our just due is well overdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams is the personification of our hard work and effort and collective brilliance,\u201d Greer said. \u201cShe is overly qualified for this position, completely ready, and she hasn\u2019t sold her soul to get to this position. She celebrates the fact that she is a black woman.\u201d\n\nAbrams, 44, embraces the historic nature of her candidacy in her stump speech, suggesting that her identity makes her uniquely qualified to lead the state. In Georgia, 21 percent of black women and Latinas live in poverty, compared with 11 percent of white women, according to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to elect me because I\u2019m black, and I don\u2019t need anyone to pick my name because I\u2019m a woman,\u201d Abrams told an audience in Macon recently. \u201cBut I need you to know that because I\u2019m a black woman, I understand the barriers to opportunity in the state of Georgia; because I\u2019m a black woman, I understand how hard you have to work sometimes to get as far as you can; and because I\u2019m a black woman, I know that when I make history, I make history with you.\u201d\n\nAbrams is a former Democratic leader of the Georgia House, the first woman to lead a caucus in either chamber. She is a graduate of Spelman College, one of the country\u2019s most prestigious historically black institutions, and has a law degree from Yale University. She has written several romance-thrillers and operated small businesses. She also founded the New Georgia Project, a voter education group that has registered tens of thousands of state residents, mostly people of color and young people.\n\nAbrams is no longer an official with the group, which has repeatedly crossed swords with Kemp, who it accuses of voter suppression for rejecting thousands of its voter registration applicants. Kemp has investigated the group for voter fraud and blamed sloppy work for many of its applications being rejected.\n\nDuring the campaign, Abrams has openly discussed her shortcomings, including a failed business and falling behind on her taxes, which Republicans have used to question her fitness for the governorship.\n\nKemp has warned that Abrams\u2019s \u201cradical agenda\u201d of expanding Medicaid and setting up a state fund to help people who want to start small businesses would be too costly. He has emphasized curbing illegal immigration and cracking down on violent gangs, echoing stances taken by Trump. He also said he would keep taxes low and government small, although he recently began promoting a pay raise for teachers.\n\nGeorgians have long favored Republicans for statewide offices, although the state\u2019s substantial African American vote and increasing number of Latino residents have given Democrats hope of flipping the state. Four years ago Democrats Jason Carter, grandson of former president Jimmy Carter, and Michelle Nunn, daughter of former senator Sam Nunn, were heralded as potential breakthrough Democratic candidates in the gubernatorial and Senate races, but both lost.\n\nThe impact of having Abrams on the ballot was evident during the May 22 state primary: Black voter turnout was up more than 40 percent compared with the last contested primary in 2010, according to an analysis by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. That far exceeded the population growth over that span of time.\n\nAcross the breadth of Georgia, groups such as the nonpartisan Black Women\u2019s Roundtable and Care in Action, the political arm of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, are knocking on doors to remind voters to go the polls, including those whose registrations have been put on hold because of discrepancies.\n\nIn Columbus, a reliably Democratic city of about 190,000 near the Alabama border, members of Delta Sigma Theta sorority recently gathered at their headquarters to call infrequent voters and try to persuade them to cast ballots this year.\n\nElsewhere, Jazmyne Gleaton, 18, a freshman a Kennesaw State University and a first-time voter, is nagging her friends to turn out.\n\n\u201cI hate it when people say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to vote.\u2019 Like my boyfriend, who said it doesn\u2019t matter. I told him, \u2018You have to vote!\u2019 \u201d said Gleaton, who is African American, in an interview outside an early voting site in Paulding County, a suburb of Atlanta that Trump won with 68 percent of the vote. She voted for Abrams, citing the candidate\u2019s criminal justice platform, which includes eliminating cash bail and decriminalizing marijuana possession and certain nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nAbrams is not solely aiming for the votes of black women but trying to assemble the multiracial coalition any Democrat needs to win a state that leans in the other direction.\n\nStill, her candidacy is potent for black women, who for so long were expected to demonstrate loyalty to Democratic candidates without always seeing themselves reflected in the names on the ballots in major races.\n\nLesley Barnes, a recently retired supervisor for Veterans Affairs, was beaming as she left a boisterous rally for Abrams at a community center in Grovetown, a small town in Columbia County, a Republican stronghold just outside Augusta. Barnes spent 20 years in the military, where she said a person\u2019s abilities were more important than their race or gender. Still, she is excited about the possibility of Abrams making history.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be real: I\u2019m a black woman. It\u2019s good for me to see somebody that looks like me getting ready to go to one of the highest offices in Georgia,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd am I voting for her just because she\u2019s black and just because she\u2019s a woman? No. But it does resonate with me.\u201d", "\n\nThe Ragamala Dance Company in \u201cWritten in Water,\u201d which the dancers will perform this weekend at the Kennedy Center. (Bruce W. Palmer)\n\nHear the phrase \u201cboard-game-inspired movement\u201d and you might think of a flourish with a chess piece, or a jubilant reach to place a Scrabble tile on a triple-word-score square. But the Ragamala Dance Company had more substantial physicality in mind for \u201cWritten in Water\u201d: The sensory-rich, idea-steeped work, which will be performed at the Kennedy Center this weekend, reflects, in part, a historical Indian version of the game Snakes and Ladders.\n\n\u201cWritten in Water,\u201d choreographed by co-artistic directors (and mother and daughter) Ranee and Aparna Ramaswamy, riffs on the conceptual and philosophical framework of Paramapadam, an Indian game whose players risk serpentine plunges while trying to ascend to a board\u2019s winning squares. Ranee and Aparna will be among the five dancers in the roughly hour-long work, which showcases the classical Indian dance style Bharatanatyam.\n\nDuring \u201cWritten in Water,\u201d illustrated-grid projections on the stage sometimes make the dancers appear to be pieces on a Paramapadam board. The illusion is infused with meaning, because the Indian snakes-and-ladders game \u2014 of which Paramapadam is one version \u2014 incorporates a morality-tale dynamic: The board\u2019s upper squares symbolize spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine, while the lower squares correspond to vices and spiritual degradation. Ascending ladders and downward-propelling snakes provide shortcuts.\n\nThe Indian game has existed in various religious and regional variants over the centuries. The pastime traveled to England during the British Raj, eventually evolving to become the secular entertainment (a.k.a. Chutes and Ladders) many of us played as youngsters. (Before each \u201cWritten in Water\u201d performance, you can play Paramapadam in the Kennedy Center atrium.)\n\nRanee Ramaswamy, who grew up in Chennai, in southern India, learned to play Paramapadam as a child. Raised in the Hindu tradition, she knew the game as a particularly popular diversion during religious festivals, with children and adults playing together. One version of the game board referenced the god Vishnu; another, the god Shiva. \u201cPlaying the game, we also learned about our own mythological stories,\u201d Ranee said by phone from Minneapolis, where the dance company is based.\n\nAparna said that when she and her mother began mulling a dance based on Paramapadam, the idea seemed accessible and \u201crich with possibilities.\u201d The game\u2019s spiritual-journey framework made them think of other cultural lenses on mystical experience, such as a Hindu story about the churning of the cosmic ocean and the 12th-century Persian Sufi poem \u201cThe Conference of the Birds,\u201d about an avian search for an elusive monarch. Both narratives became additional thematic springboards for \u201cWritten in Water,\u201d which exemplifies the Ragamala Dance practice of treating Bharatanatyam, in Aparna\u2019s words, as an art form that is \u201calive and contemporary and growing.\u201d\n\nThe resonance of \u201cConference of the Birds\u201d prompted the Ramaswamys to contact Iraqi American jazz artist Amir ElSaffar, who, in addition to playing the trumpet and santur (a hammered dulcimer), is adept in Maqam, a classical vocal tradition that draws on musical traditions from Iraq\u2019s neighbors, as well as traditions within Iraq. He wrote parts of the \u201cWritten in Water\u201d score, and he leads an ensemble providing live accompaniment for \u201cWritten in Water\u201d performances. (India-based composer Prema Ramamurthy composed other sections, consisting of southern Indian music.)\n\nFolding Maqam and Persian literature into \u201cWritten in Water\u201d might seem a bold move in an era leery of cultural appropriation. But Ranee Ramaswamy says the company took pains to make the work\u2019s multicultural strands knowledgeable, respectful and \u201ccorrect.\u201d\n\nBesides, she says, \u201ccultures have some commonality. And if we hold on to that, we can make magic.\u201d", "\n\nThe cast of \u201cKing John,\u201d at Folger Theatre. (Teresa Wood)\n\nFolger's 'King John'\n\nShakespeare wrote his own game of thrones.

But it does boast some noteworthy characters \u2014 particularly the troublemaking Constance, a royal, self-dramatizing stage mother intent on seeing her son ascend the throne. . . . Aaron Posner, a playwright and director who has achieved some of his best results at Folger with Shakespeare\u2019s thornier works, demonstrates again with \u201cKing John\u201d a deft command of the art of the overhaul. Lacking a truly galvanizing character \u2014 the weak and dissembling John is no Henry V or Richard II \u2014 the play has neither a satisfying core nor a powerhouse finale. Nevertheless, Posner builds a lucid argument for the play through a fleet handling of the plot mechanics and a fine cast that includes Holly Twyford as Constance, Brian Dykstra as John and Kate Eastwood Norris as the bastard pretender to the throne, Philip.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump is fond of asserting that \u201c Collusion is not a crime, but that [it] doesn\u2019t matter because there was No Collusion .\u201d Signs are gathering that both of those claims may be challenged by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. As longtime criminal law practitioners, we believe that the first indictment of someone within Trump\u2019s inner circle could be imminent for collusion-related crimes of the kind we detail in a new report. If such charges are filed, that would have profound consequences for those around Trump, the president himself and for our democracy.\n\nThat target appears to be Roger Stone, the political provocateur and longtime Trump confidante. Stone himself has said he believes he may be indicted , declaring that \u201cRobert S. Mueller III is coming for me\u201d and raising legal defense funds. In our view, he has ample reason for concern. Mueller has already issued two indictments laying out the Russian attack on our democracy, and one of those indictments seems to point to Stone as \u201ca person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump\u201d who had discussions with a Russian operative using the handle \u201cGuccifer 2.0.\u201d Stone has acknowledged that he is likely the person named in the indictment. And just last week Mueller reportedly interviewed former Trump campaign chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon about Stone\u2019s private statements regarding WikiLeaks and the emails it later released.\n\nStone forcefully denies any wrongdoing. In response to questions from The Washington Post, he said that \u201cif the decision is based on evidence, facts and truth, no charges will be brought against me.\u201d\n\nBut Mueller may not agree. Portents that an indictment could issue soon also include the recent grand jury appearances of Stone associates. There reportedly has been testimony by Randy Credico, who may have been a conduit between Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and Jerome Corsi, who may have been called to testify about information he shared with Stone . Others around Stone were issued grand jury subpoenas to appear as well, including one who refused to comply and has been held in contempt .\n\nIn our near-century of combined criminal law experience, all these indicators point to potential charges. Indeed, but for the Justice Department\u2019s practice of avoiding indictments that could affect an election in the 60-day window before balloting, the Stone indictment might have been issued already. When that blackout period ends, Mueller may be ready to move.\n\n[Trump's real problem is that he obstructed justice, and Mueller can prove it. Here's how.]\n\nThat is when things will get interesting. With each indictment, the special counsel is inching closer and closer to the president. Stone spoke regularly to Trump for years , worked for Trump on the campaign for a time and continued to communicate with him thereafter, including when Trump ascended to the White House. It will be much harder for Trump to continue his two-pronged collusion denials if someone as close to him as Stone is indicted.\n\nThe risk to the president would deepen if Stone chose to cooperate. Stone is defiant now. But so was Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Manafort was willing to see the fight through to conviction on eight separate counts before he finally acceded to the possibility that even with a potential pardon, he might be better off playing ball with the special counsel\u2019s office. He has reportedly met with them nine times in the past four weeks to proffer what he knows.\n\nThat is not just a precedent. It is also a pressure point: Manafort is a longtime Stone associate as well. He surely has been questioned about his knowledge of any Russia-related communications by or with Stone, including ones involving candidate Trump or those around him.\n\n[Trump's lawyer say he's above the law. They clearly don't understand it.]\n\nIf Stone were to cooperate, he could have much to say. We know that Trump campaign officials had at least 87 reported contacts with Russia-linked individuals and officials during the 2016 election cycle. Among those was the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Russian nationals and senior members of the campaign in June 2016, for which Donald Trump Jr. was promised \u201cinformation that would incriminate\u201d Hillary Clinton, and to which he responded, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\u201d That was, of course, when the stolen Democratic National Committee email was released \u2014 and Mueller, it seems, has already alleged that Stone had contacts with a Russian entity involved (though Stone says those contacts all came after the initial release of the emails).\n\nAfter next week\u2019s election, Mueller could also ratchet up the pressure on Trump by producing his report on collusion or obstruction of justice. On the former, the special counsel has reportedly turned his focus to Trump, submitting questions to him to answer in writing. On the latter, there is already substantial evidence of presidential obstruction . Speculation has been intense that an obstruction report could also drop after the 60-day election blackout ends.\n\nThe president is not one to passively await these legal walls closing in on him. He has wild cards of his own to play: Media reports and congressional observers alike suggest that after the midterm elections, Trump will clean house at Justice. He could fire Mueller\u2019s supervisor, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, replacing him with a crony who will choke off the investigation. A new supervisor could potentially even go so far as to bar the special counsel from filing indictments or block him from disclosing his findings to Congress or the public.\n\nOr Trump could leave Rosenstein in place but seek to take away his supervisory authority by firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The deputy attorney general oversees Mueller only because the attorney general had a conflict owing to his ties to Trump. Any new attorney general should also recuse, given the president\u2019s many statements that he expects his attorney general to protect him. But whomever the president chooses might not take that ethically necessary step. If the attorney general is replaced by a Trump crony, he or she might seek to assume oversight of Mueller, or even claim the special counsel is no longer needed \u2014 an outcome the president, too, could try to order. Like Richard Nixon\u2019s Saturday Night Massacre, those outcomes would threaten a constitutional crisis, with the president taking steps to put himself above the rule of law.\n\n[Trump or Congress could still block Mueller's investigation. I know. I wrote the rules.]\n\nOf course, we do not know whether Mueller\u2019s implacable forward motion in the direction of the president will lead to a collision with the president\u2019s open hostility to the investigation. Trump may back down from stimulating a crisis, as he has done before . But if the weeks after the election bring a Stone indictment and perhaps one or more Mueller reports, tensions could well intensify, if not erupt into outright conflict.\n\nUltimately, though, the real power doesn\u2019t belong only to Mueller or Trump. It also resides with members of Congress, and the voters who put them there. The majority leadership in Congress has failed to hold Trump accountable. The House has particularly abdicated its oversight role. If it remains led by those in his own party who have repeatedly turned a blind eye to Trump and his administration, he may take that as license to do as he pleases. Conversely, if the election results in at least one body of Congress in a position to exercise real oversight, that may check the president\u2019s willingness to provoke a constitutional clash. He will know that if he disrupts the investigation, there is an authority beyond his control that can take it over.\n\nWith voting less than a week away \u2014 and already well in progress in many states \u2014 the outcome of the looming clash appears to reside exactly where it belongs in a democracy: with the American people.", "THE PROGNOSIS\n\nA man fills out an information card during an Affordable Care Act outreach event. (Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters)\n\nThe first Affordable Care Act enrollment season opens today in which GOP-led changes to Obamacare are fully in place. The changes may not be as disastrous to the insurance marketplaces as Democrats would have you believe.\n\nTo be sure, the Trump administration has adopted a sharply different approach than the Obama administration to the insurance marketplaces where about 11 million people get their health coverage. It has opened the door to cheaper, leaner plans. It has slashed spending on advertising and outreach. It has applauded Congress for repealing the penalty for being uninsured.\n\nIn response, Democrats seeking to gain seats in next Tuesday\u2019s midterm election have kept up a drumbeat of criticism slamming the administration for trying to sabotage Obamacare:\n\nSen. Patty Murray (Wash.), top Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee:\n\nRepublicans must stop their sabotage of our health care system. They must stop driving up prices. They must work with Democrats to address the damage they've done so we can increase access and lower prices for patients and families. https://t.co/yEKgBe3rWu \u2014 Senator Patty Murray (@PattyMurray) October 18, 2018\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.):\n\nBecause of Republicans\u2019 sabotage of our healthcare system, middle class Tennesseans will pay hundreds of dollars more in premiums than they would otherwise. https://t.co/SbxZfjopq1 \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 13, 2018\n\nThe basic conditions, however, that drove Americans to seek insurance in the marketplaces created by the 2010 ACA remain the same. That includes subsidies, which help about four in five lower-income marketplace shoppers afford plans, and a requirement that plans accept people with preexisting conditions and cover a full range of health services. Republicans still say they want to repeal and replace the ACA -- but in order to try again, the GOP would have to hold its House majority, plus gain some additional Senate seats.\n\nThere are some signs insurers have finally found their sweet spot in the marketplaces. After several years of spiking premiums and insurer exits, the marketplaces appear much more stable at the start of the 2019 enrollment season, which runs Nov. 1 through Dec. 15.\n\nRecall the widespread surprise last year when marketplace enrollment dropped by only 400,000, despite frequent predictions the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to \"sabotage\" them would result in a million or more people dropping out of the marketplaces.\n\nThe final enrollment figure for 2018 \u2014 11.8 million \u2014 is the benchmark number to keep in mind when the administration releases 2019 signup totals. It will be interesting to see whether enrollment holds steady, decreases or even increases, considering that some marketplace plans actually became cheaper for to buy for next year.\n\nTop health officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Seema Verma, still regularly criticize Obamacare.\n\nAzar and Verma are not terribly eager to talk about Obamacare -- spokespeople for both officials said they have no public events scheduled today as open enrollment launches. And when they do refer to the ACA, they argue they\u2019re making the best of what they view as a bad situation and law.\n\nFact check: When @POTUS came to office, he inherited a mess in the market. Premiums were skyrocketing,\u2019 insurers were leaving. Premiums were not \u201ccontained,\u201d but were, in fact, pricing millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions, out of the market. https://t.co/BsLEeWLZ18 \u2014 Administrator Seema Verma (@SeemaCMS) October 31, 2018\n\nI had a wonderful visit with our CCIIO team this morning! We\u2019re ready & excited to kick off open enrollment this year!

But there\u2019s reason to believe the administration's actions won\u2019t have a huge effect on coverage for the vast majority of customers \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nFor one thing, the individual mandate, eliminated in the GOP tax cut overhaul, was less effective in practice than in theory. That's because the fine for people who didn't buy insurance was less than many people might pay in annual premiums. The executive branch also lacked sufficient enforcement mechanisms all along. There are estimates that repealing the penalty caused higher premiums than if it had been left in place, but premiums also haven't skyrocketed as Democrats had predicted.\n\nAnd there\u2019s something else: The leaner, cheaper policies being encouraged by the Trump administration \u2014 those \u201cjunk\u201d plans Democrats keep referring to \u2014 aren\u2019t yet widely available.\n\nOver the summer, the administration finalized two new policies expanding two alternative types of health coverage \u2014 short-term health plans and association health plans \u2014 that generally cost less but are also exempt from ACA requirements to cover a full slate of services and accept people with preexisting conditions.\n\nIn theory, these plans could put upward pressure on premiums because they would draw healthy people away from the marketplaces, leaving sicker people behind. Plus, some activists and experts fear people might lured into buying these cheaper plans without realizing they might not cover needed benefits.\n\nThe new regulations didn\u2019t go into effect until this fall, so insurance carriers are still working on developing plans that fit these new categories, insurance experts say.\n\nSean Malia Sr., director of carrier relations for the web broker eHealth, told me there's interest among insurers in offering expanded short-term plans. But he said they won\u2019t be ready to roll out these plans until early next year and it's uncertain how widely available they\u2019ll be in the end anyway. Plus, Malia noted, 20 states have placed stricter limits on short-term plans than allowed by new federal rules.\n\nMalia said he\u2019s also hearing some interest from insurers in offering association health plans (referred to by health wonks as AHPs). But he said carriers are still figuring out exactly how such plans would work under the new rules and considering whether it\u2019s worth selling them.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is not a lot of carriers haven\u2019t bought into AHPs as of yet, so they\u2019re not widely available right now,\u201d Malia said. \u201cA lot of it is still very fluid. As more carriers start to get involved, things will start to get more concrete.\u201d\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nSeema Verma, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is interviewed by Paige Winfield Cunningham at a Washington Post live news event. (Kate Patterson for The Washington Post)\n\nAHH: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services yesterday approved a plan to allow Wisconsin to become the fourth state to implement work requirements for people who receive Medicaid benefits.\n\nThe state will require Medicaid beneficiaries to complete 80 hours a month of work in order to maintain enrollment. Individuals in the program will be locked out of it for six months if they fail to comply with the requirements for 48 months. That appears to be far more lenient than the requirement in Arkansas, which says people will lose insurance if they fail to comply for three months in a year.\n\n\u201cFour other states have won such permission this year, including Arkansas, which has cut off several thousand people from benefits for failing to meet its \u2018community engagement\u2019 requirement,\u201d our colleague Amy Goldstein reports. \u201cA federal judge has blocked the work requirement in Kentucky, the first state to attain permission last winter; Wisconsin becomes the administration\u2019s first new approval since the court ruling early this summer.\u201d\n\nVerma acknowledged \u201cthere are people who disagree with this approach.\u201d \u201cSome believe that our sole purpose is to finance public benefits, even if that means lost opportunity and a life tethered to government dependence,\u201d she said in a statement yesterday. \u201cWe will not retreat from this position.\u201d\n\nAmy also notes that Wisconsin will be the first state to \u201ccompel certain poor residents to disclose behavior such as drinking and exercise to qualify for Medicaid \u2014 and to charge more to people whose behavior the state judges as risky.\u201d\n\nFrom Verma:\n\nToday, @CMSGov approved #Wisconsin\u2019s request to amend & extend their #BadgerCare #Medicaid reform demonstration.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\n\u2014 One of Democrats\u2019 top priorities if they recapture the House majority would be tackling the increasing costs of prescription drugs, the New York Times\u2019s Nicholas Fandos reports. It\u2019s one of a number of agenda items, including campaign and ethics changes and infrastructure investment, that top Democrats told the Times is part of their agenda.\n\nIn an interview with the Times, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also said Democrats would work to improve Obamacare instead of looking to immediately replace it with a single-payer system.\n\nPelosi predicted a Democratic victory and said it would be a \u201cbitter pill for them all to swallow when they see the election results, if they turn out as we expect.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he himself knows what he is going to do,\u201d she said about the president\u2019s willingness to cooperate if Democrats are successful in the House.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have also prepared detailed, more liberal approaches for a $1 trillion infrastructure package and how to slow the increases in prescription drug costs, but indicated that they would steer proposals through the regular committee process in an effort to try to build a consensus with Republicans first,\u201d Nicholas writes.\n\nMeanwhile, Pelosi has been declaring victory for Democrats both in public and private, Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan and Caitlin Oprysko report.\n\n\u201cPelosi's spiking of the ball \u2014 even if her supporters wouldn't call it that \u2014 could be risky.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings, Pool)\n\n\u2014 Abortion took the stage in Indianapolis this week in the debate between Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly and his Republican challenger Mike Braun in their competitive matchup. For his part, Donnelly tried to force the issue and coax a response from Braun, the Associated Press\u2019s Brian Slodysko reports.\n\nBoth candidates have said they are opposed to abortion, although Donnelly says he supports exceptions being made in the cases of rape, incest or when there\u2019s a risk to the mother\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cIf your daughter happens to be raped, Mike thinks the government has a role in the middle of that \u2014 I don\u2019t,\u201d Donnelly said.\n\nBut Braun seemed to avoid the same gaffe-filled fate of Donnelly\u2019s 2012 opponent, who during a debate said that women who get pregnant after being raped are carrying a \u201cgift from God,\" Brian writes. \u201cThe senator tries to have it both ways. When it comes to the sanctity of life, you cannot say you are pro-life and have your voting record,\u201d Braun said of Donnelly. He added he would \u201cnever demonize anyone who disagrees with my point of view.\u201d\n\n\"The politics of abortion are complicated in Indiana, a state so dominated by Republicans that policy fights over the issue are typically waged by differing factions within the party,\" Brian reports. \"In an election that could hinge on support from independents and moderate Republican women, it could also prove to be a volatile electoral issue.\"\n\nMEDICAL MISSIVES\n\nMourners embrace during a processional outside of Congregation Beth Shalom for the funeral of Joyce Fienberg who was killed at the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 Yet another mass shooting has restarted an ongoing national conversation about American\u2019s gun laws, and this time just days before the midterm elections.\n\nOur Post colleague Eugene Scott writes that\u2019s in part driven by the president\u2019s own comments about guns on the same day a shooting left 11 people at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Police say the shooter was armed with multiple handguns and an assault rifle. While Trump suggested that an armed guard inside the synagogue could have stopped the shooter, he also said that gun laws have \u201clittle to do with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGun laws are among the most politically polarizing issues, but heading into the midterm elections there had not been much talk about them,\u201d Eugene writes. \u201cA week before the shooting, the Pew Research Center published data showing that there are some specific policy proposals that both Republicans and Democrats support broadly. Most Americans say gun laws should be more strict \u2014 and the number who say so has increased over the past year. Nearly six in 10 \u2014 57 percent \u2014 of Americans think gun laws should be stricter. That number was 52 percent last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter mass shootings, it is common to hear questions and concerns about the suspect\u2019s mental health. Perhaps in light of that, overwhelming majorities (89 percent) of Republicans, Democrats and independents who lean toward one of the parties say people who are mentally ill should be barred from buying guns.\u201d\n\nTrump and Republicans have previously campaigned on protecting gun ownership, but passing any legislation to address limitations on purchasing guns \u201chasn\u2019t really hinged on public onion in the past, and it\u2019s not likely to anytime soon,\u201d Eugene reports.\n\n\u201cThe gun lobby, including highly influential groups such as the National Rifle Association, holds sway with large swaths of Congress, and voters in the Republican base still generally oppose stricter gun laws. In the Pew survey, Republicans were four times (76 percent) more likely than Democrats (19 percent) to say that gun rights are more important than gun control.\u201d\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads:\n\nWorld As Venezuela\u2019s health system collapses, disease spreads beyond its borders A massive wave of migrants is transmitting once-rare diseases to other parts of Latin America Anthony Faiola, Marina Lopes, Rachelle Krygier, Gui Christ, Joanne Lee and Chloe Coleman\n\nHouse Republican calls on Senate to take up abandoned Obamacare repeal bill Rep.

(Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said Thursday that he was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d to discover a \u201cwarm and personal side\u201d to President Trump when he visited the Pittsburgh synagogue this week following Saturday\u2019s deadly shootings there.\n\nMyers\u2019s comments about Trump, who has been criticized for a lack of empathy in responding to national tragedies, came during a CNN interview in which he recounted a visit Tuesday that also included first lady Melania Trump, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, both of whom are Jewish.\n\n\u201cI was privileged to have a private 15 or 20 minutes with the family,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe president was very warm, very consoling, put his hand on my shoulder, and the first question he asked me was, \u2018Rabbi, tell me how are you doing.\u2019 I must say throughout the time we spent together, I was pleasantly surprised by a warm and personal side to the president that I don\u2019t think America has ever seen.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s visit to Pittsburgh after synagogue massacre creates tensions in grieving city]\n\nTrump did not speak publicly during his brief visit to Pittsburgh, instead quietly paying tribute at the synagogue by laying flowers for the 11 victims and visiting a hospital to see officers who were wounded in the shooting rampage.\n\nAhead of the visit, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto (D) and other officials said any visit by the president should come after the burials of those killed Saturday. Trump\u2019s presence drew peaceful protesters outside the synagogue.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump found his visit to be \u201cvery humbling\u201d and \u201cvery sad.\u201d She said he was \u201cincredibly impressed\u201d by Myers.", "Only one week ahead of the midterms, President Trump is working hard to turn a few thousand migrants who are on their way to the United States into an \u201cinvasion.\u201d More than 5,000 active U.S. service members have been ordered to the border, as the president is spreading unsubstantiated claims that \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d are in the caravan.\n\nThere is no evidence for a looming invasion or a terrorism risk. But Trump\u2019s game of making up a migrant invading force isn\u2019t surprising to anyone who has watched populists gain power in Europe in recent years. There\u2019s no better way for populists to win an election than by announcing a national emergency that plays into voters' fears.\n\n\u201cThe claim that alleged terrorists in that caravan pose a risk is simply wrong, but of course if fits into Trump\u2019s strategy,\u201d said Peter Neumann, a London-based radicalization scholar who is writing a book about Trump\u2019s approach to counterterrorism. \u201cUnlike Bush and Obama, Trump has conflated the issues of Islam, migration and terrorism and is treating them as one. That\u2019s very much similar to what European populists have done, by pushing the idea of a clash of civilizations,\u201d he said.\n\nEuropeans still remember how then-UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage unveiled a poster ahead of the Brexit vote that read \u201cBreaking Point\u201d and showed a long line of predominantly male refugees.\n\nYour new poster resembles outright Nazi propaganda, @Nigel_Farage. Thanks to @brendanjharkin for pointing it out. pic.twitter.com/Rd89XZSvfD \u2014 Connor Beaton (@cdbeaton) June 16, 2016\n\nFarage, of course, didn\u2019t mention that almost none of those refugees had any chance of ever reaching Britain because the country is not part of the border-free Schengen zone. Only a tiny fraction of the refugees who entered Europe ended up in Britain \u2014 with most of them being carefully resettled and screened by the government \u2014 while more than 1 million headed to Germany. Yet it was Britain and not Germany that later decided to leave the European Union to \u201ctake back control,\u201d as Farage said.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the example of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. When migrant flows into Europe surged in 2015, many arrived in the central European country \u2014 but almost nobody wanted to stay there, given the state of social services and a more hostile attitude toward migrants than in Western Europe. Regardless of the nonexistent threat of being overwhelmed by refugees in the long run, Orban ordered the construction of a border fence and some of the toughest anti-migrant laws in the Western Hemisphere. The strategy worked: Many Hungarians bought into the threat scenario Orban made up and celebrated remarks in which he claimed that Muslims were an immediate threat to Europe\u2019s Christian identity.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat ironic, because Hungary in fact needs foreign workers and is now trying to recruit non-Muslims from abroad. The reason? Many Hungarians have escaped unemployment or poor social services in their country and have moved to wealthier nations such as Austria and Germany.\n\nThere has been a similar exodus among younger Italians who suffered under a youth unemployment rate of about 35 percent last year. When the country\u2019s new populist government came to power this year, the number of refugees arriving there had significantly decreased. So Italy\u2019s government decided to create some unnecessary drama to put the issue back on the news agenda by temporarily preventing its own Coast Guard members from disembarking from their vessel, after they picked up migrants at sea. The government also has cracked down on private rescue operations, arguing they encourage crossing attempts.\n\nPreventing a few hundred migrants from entering Italy may never have been the point the Italian government wanted to make \u2014 as is so often the case in recent years, the domestic message here was the real key to understanding what was unfolding. Artificially creating that crisis has come at a high cost, however. Human rights groups say that the crackdown on rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea has resulted in a surge in migrant deaths, even as fewer people have tried to cross.\n\n\n\nThe casket of a migrant who died when a boat capsized off the coast of Sicily is lifted by crane to an Italian Navy ship at the Lampedusa island harbor on Oct. 12, 2013. (Mauro Buccarello/AP)\n\nIn the case of Trump, careful observers may have suspected a long time ago that he was keen on the European populists\u2019 playbook. In 2016, the Trump campaign released a video ad in which a narrator warned of \u201cillegal immigration\u201d at the southern border and demanded the construction of a border wall to stop it.\n\nTo make its point, the Trump campaign showed dramatic footage of African migrants scaling the fences around the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Morocco. It neglected to mention that the events in the video took place more than 5,000 miles from the United States' southern border, just like some of the other facts that went unmentioned as populist leaders made up invasions that never occurred.\n\nRead more:\n\nFact-checking Trump\u2019s macho talk on birthright citizenship, military at the border\n\nWhat is and isn\u2019t happening with the migrant caravan in southern Mexico\n\nTrump embraces \u2018wag the dog\u2019 politics", "", "There\u2019s a new form of cryptocurrency gaining traction among fans of digital cash.\n\nUnlike bitcoin, which has seen its price swing wildly from as high as $19,000 last year to its current level hovering around $6,200, this emerging class of cryptocurrency aims to maintain a stable price \u2014 one, single U.S. dollar \u2014 at all times.\n\nA cryptocurrency whose price never fluctuates might sound nonsensical, particularly to entry-level traders who want to profit off a cryptocurrency\u2019s appreciation. But many in the industry say the rise of \u201cstablecoins\u201d has in fact been instrumental for active investors \u2014 and could represent a crucial steppingstone to the future of money.\n\nBitcoin was hailed initially as a form of digital cash that could be used to purchase real-world goods and services. But in practice, the currency\u2019s volatility has made buying anything with it far more complicated. In one early example from 2010, a programmer offered to pay for two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoin. At the time, that amounted to roughly $30. At today\u2019s prices, it would be equivalent to $62 million.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether the price of that crypto is going to go up or down, but it\u2019s almost certainly not going to be the same as it is today,\u201d said Josh Fraser, co-founder of the cryptocurrency start-up Origin Protocol. \u201cThat introduces the problem [for] either the buyer or seller . . . as part of that transaction.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why many in the industry now see stablecoins as a big opportunity that could fulfill much of bitcoin\u2019s original promise as a medium of exchange.\n\nIn recent months, dozens of stablecoin projects have been launched or announced. With names like TrueUSD, Paxos, Havven and Dai, this new crop of coins enjoys a combined market cap of more than $2.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, which tracks the price of hundreds of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn September, Gemini \u2014 the cryptocurrency exchange supported by the twin entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss \u2014 announced the Gemini Dollar; earlier this month, the payments company Circle said its U.S. Dollar Coin would become available on Coinbase, one of America\u2019s most prominent exchanges.\n\n\u201cStablecoins bring some of the early potential of crypto into view,\u201d said Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase\u2019s chief technology officer, \u201cand they make possible payments that are very small, very fast, very large, very international, very transparent and very automated.\u201d\n\nGiving the U.S. dollar digital properties reflects the next stage of evolution for money, supporters say, because it takes the best attributes of a reserve currency \u2014 its reliability and universality \u2014 and combines them with the newfound technological capabilities of a cryptocurrency. It may not only enable faster payments that don\u2019t involve banks or the clunky Automated Clearing House system, but could also allow for new kinds of financial apps and services that don\u2019t depend on partnerships with banks to function. Entirely new economic relationships could arise in the form of digital economic contracts that enforce themselves. Although bitcoin offered the same promise, experts say, it has been held back by technical challenges, prompting entrepreneurs to look for new approaches.\n\nMany of the better-known stablecoins operate on a simple idea: Buyers pay a dollar to receive a digital token. The dollar is then held in reserve. If a buyer later decides to cash out, she can redeem her tokens for dollars at a one-to-one ratio. Buyers can also swap dollar-backed tokens for other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or ethereum, at various exchange rates. Certain other stablecoin projects seek to use algorithms to control the money supply by adding and deleting coins so that the trading price always stays at one dollar.\n\nThe idea for a cryptocurrency that is all but identical to the dollar is not new. In 2014, a company named Tether launched a coin with a unique proposition: For every Tether in circulation, there would be one U.S. dollar to back it up.\n\nTether fulfilled an important need in the investor community, experts say. At a time of volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, Tether\u2019s stablecoin allowed investors to seek the relative safety of a dollar-like vehicle without actually cashing out of the cryptocurrency space entirely, which could lead to costly fees and delays. (The company did not respond to requests for an interview.)\n\nTether proved wildly popular: By late August, its own market cap had hit $2.8 billion.\n\nBut not all was well: In the past several weeks, Tether has been hit by a massive crisis of confidence. On some exchanges, Tether began trading at well below a dollar, which is not supposed to happen for a currency whose sole purpose is to maintain a solid peg. While the precise reasons for the slippage remain unclear, investors have engaged in a sell-off, and Bitfinex \u2014 a major exchange that shares the same management as Tether \u2014 took hundreds of millions of Tether coins out of circulation. In one month, Tether lost almost $1 billion in its market cap.\n\nPart of what\u2019s driving the chaos is a long-standing suspicion among some Tether skeptics that the company lacks the dollars on hand to repay people should they seek to redeem their Tether tokens en masse. A related concern is that if there are more Tether tokens in circulation than there really ought to be, and the Tether is being traded for other cryptocurrencies, then perhaps those currencies' prices could be overstated, resulting in possible distortions and uncertainty in the wider market. Tether has not succeeded in tamping down those fears; the company has steadfastly avoided opening its books for a professional audit, despite making claims that it is solvent.\n\nAlthough Tether is still the most dominant stablecoin, the chaos appears to be helping its rivals, according to an analysis by the publication CoinDesk, which noted an uptick in the market shares of TrueUSD and U.S. Dollar Coin in recent weeks.\n\nThe secrecy and uncertainty surrounding Tether has encouraged many other entrepreneurs to build competing dollar-backed coins that have \u201cmore transparency\u201d than Tether, Fraser said.\n\nCritics of stablecoins say they can\u2019t work, because they ignore what economists have learned over hundreds of years.\n\nPreston Byrne, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, has called stablecoins a \u201ctechno-magical idea,\u201d particularly referring to the projects that rely on algorithms to control the money supply. Dictating the price of the currency and expecting the market to obey, rather than allowing the market to set a currency\u2019s price, is backward, he has said.\n\nFor a company to amass billions of dollars on the off chance it will have to pay it out all at once makes for an expensive business model that doesn\u2019t scale, wrote Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, in a recent op-ed. Holding just a fraction of the needed reserves isn\u2019t much of a solution either, he added, because it could lead to disaster in the event of a run on the currency.\n\n\u201cAll of this will be familiar to anyone who has encountered even a single study on speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates, or to anyone who has had a coffee with an emerging-market central banker,\u201d he wrote.\n\nYet some of the cryptocurrency industry\u2019s biggest players insist that soon we will see not just digital tokens backed by U.S. dollars, but also others mimicking the euro, the yen, the British pound and many others.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think in five years people will be calling them stablecoins,\u201d said Jeremy Allaire, the chief executive of Circle. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be \u2018money on the Internet.\u2019\u201d", "\n\nPitmaster Shawn McWhirter takes a brisket out of the smoker at DCity Smokehouse, a neighborhood barbecue joint that is participating in DMV Black Restaurant Week.

The Freer is showing \u201cLong Day\u2019s Journey into Night,\u201d the second film from director Bi Gan, who is already being lauded as one of China\u2019s most prodigious filmmakers. Critics praised the film\u2019s innovative visual style when it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival. The signature moment comes halfway through the movie, when the protagonist enters a theater and puts on 3-D specs \u2014 at the same time, the viewer is asked to do the same \u2014 and goes on a surreal journey that is captured in a 59-minute uninterrupted take. 7 p.m. Free.\n\nFounders\u2019 CBS 2018 Release Party at ChurchKey: One of the District\u2019s best beer bars is the natural site to host the release of one of the country\u2019s most beloved beers. Michigan\u2019s Founders Brewing Company \u2014 you\u2019ve probably had one of their All Day session IPAs \u2014 may be best known for its string of annual special release (and limited quantity) breakfast stouts. This year\u2019s Canadian Breakfast Stout combines coffee and chocolate and is aged in bourbon barrels that once held Michigan maple syrup. Try it alongside the 2017 version, as well as Founders\u2019 popular Kentucky Breakfast Stout. 4 p.m. Free admission; drafts priced individually by the glass and in four-ounce tasting pours.\n\n\u2018Hocus Pocus\u2019 at Union Market: If you aren\u2019t yet sick of Halloween, check out a beloved movie of the season in which three evil witches return to Salem, Mass., after three centuries, and it\u2019s up to a group of kids to stop them. This is the last drive-in movie event of the year at Union Market; the parking lot opens up at 5:30 p.m. so you can park and take a trip around the market to stock up on snacks for the film. Lot opens 5:30 p.m., lot closes promptly at 7:45, film begins 8. $10 parking fee per car, walk-ups are free.\n\nGive at St. Stephen\u2019s and the Incarnation Episcopal Church: Whether you\u2019re a botanist or a punk, if you commute on Metro\u2019s Red Line, you\u2019ve probably noticed the flowery graffiti adorning a concrete partition between Takoma Park and Silver Spring \u2014 a jumbo daisy with splotchy petals circumscribing the letter \u201cG.\u201d The \u201cG\u201d stands for Give, a hardcore punk outfit from the District that has been cultivating its own mutant strain of flower power for more than a decade. When the band assembled in 2008, that daisy logo felt like a rejoinder to the dour mood that permeated the greater American hardcore scene, and Give\u2019s album covers have been petal-sprinkled ever since. Fittingly, John Scharbach\u2019s optimistic roar has always resided at the center of Give\u2019s sound, while his bandmates \u2014 bassist Doug \u201cFree\u201d Cho, guitarist Ian Marshall, drummer Gene Melkisethian and guitarist Ben Schultz \u2014 continue to channel a spectrum of feelings at high volumes. 8 p.m. Sold out.\n\n[After a decade on the scene, Give is still cultivating hardcore joy]\n\nSaturday, Nov. 3\n\n\u2018Death Becomes Us\u2019 True Crime Festival at Lisner Auditorium: Mysteries, murders and all things macabre are at the center of Brightest Young Things\u2019 first true-crime festival. Notable podcasts, television personalities and experts will gather at Lisner Auditorium to discuss some of history\u2019s most infamous crimes and offer their insight and theories into these cases. Featured events include the \u201cThe Last Podcast on the Left\u201d; a conversation with Lt. Joe Kenda from the Investigation Discovery show \u201cHomicide Hunter\u201d; and a talk with \u201cMindhunter\u201d author John Douglas. Times and ticket prices vary.\n\nRare Essence, Backyard Band, the Junkyard Band, New Impressionz at Echostage: While go-go remains the District\u2019s preeminent homegrown genre, it\u2019s often difficult to find a concert within the city limits. Recent years have seen go-go acts pop up at U Street Music Hall and the Howard Theatre, but rarely at one of the biggest venues, such as the 3,000-head Echostage. And even rarer than a go-go show in D.C. is one featuring four of the sound\u2019s most reliable acts: Rare Essence, Backyard Band, the Junkyard Band and New Impressionz. The Blend Show promises that all four will be \u201con one stage, side by side,\u201d for a legendary \u2014 and local \u2014 evening. 9 p.m. $50-$70.\n\nAdams Morgan Apple Festival: The District is finally settling into fall weather, and what better way to celebrate than enjoying seasonal apples? Adams Morgan\u2019s farmers market (at 18th Street NW and Columbia Road) will turn into a showcase for all things apples, and will feature its fifth annual pie contest, where local amateur bakers will show off their best versions of the classic dessert. 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Free.\n\nD.C. Beer Festival at Nationals Park: The D.C. Beer Festival returns to Nationals Park for its sixth year, with 80 craft breweries from around the area (and beyond) on hand to pour seasonal selections. There will be games, DJs and more events around the stadium\u2019s concourse over the course of the festival\u2019s two sessions \u2014 one beginning at noon and the other at 5 p.m. Session one: Noon to 3 p.m.; Session two: 5 to 8 p.m. $45-$75.\n\nSunday, Nov. 4\n\nDMV Black Restaurant Week at various locations: Washington\u2019s restaurant scene has exploded in the past few years, with a growing number of black-owned businesses opening. The inaugural DMV Black Restaurant Week will highlight the magnitude of how many establishments exist in the region, featuring all-inclusive three-course menu options ($25-$35) or discounted prices at more than two dozen black-owned and allied partner restaurants, such as Smith Commons, Matchbox, Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl and DCity Smokehouse. Aside from food deals, DMV Black Restaurant Week will host several events during its run, including a bartending competition at Service Bar on Monday and a conference centered on small-business ownership at the University of the District of Columbia on Nov. 10. Through Nov. 11.\n\nThe Blaze at the Fillmore: Every generation gets the French electro duo it deserves. Picking up the synthesizer-and-turntable baton from Daft Punk and Justice these days is the Blaze, the French cousins Guillaume and Jonathan Alric. Instead of the stadium-size grooves of its forebears, the Blaze is permanently chilled out and low key, its beats and melodies subtle and seductive. Despite the title of the Alrics\u2019 debut album, this isn\u2019t music for the \u201cDancehall\u201d: These are vibe-first tunes generated for festivals and music videos, and imported into the club: softer, smaller, slower, slighter. For the Netflix-and-chill generation, it\u2019s probably for the best. 8 p.m. $25.\n\nKweku Collins at Union Stage: Kweku Collins is from Evanston, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, and his physical distance from the Second City replicates itself in his music. His meditative, introspective take on hip-hop is a little removed from both the city\u2019s street-rap scene and its soul- and gospel-inflected one. Instead, Collins mixes in electronic ambiance and psychedelic rock influences as he weaves dreamlike, experimental compositions. And although he\u2019s linked with Closed Sessions, the Chicago-based purveyors of left-field rap and R&B in the city and beyond, Collins is still in his own sphere. \u201cYou can\u2019t see my thoughts,\u201d he sings, \u201cbut I can take you there.\u201d 8 p.m. $15.\n\n\u2014 Hau Chu, Chris Kelly, Chris Richards and Stephanie Williams", "bad url", "bad url", "\n\nPresident Trump speaks an event at the White House on Wednesday. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nWith each new figure, he sounds that much more ridiculous. \u201cPresident Trump said Wednesday that he would deploy as many as 15,000 military personnel to the border with Mexico in response to a caravan of Central American migrants making its way northward, doubling the figure that Pentagon officials said would be operating there. . . . If the deployment reaches 15,000 troops, it would be roughly equivalent to the size of the U.S. military\u2019s presence in Afghanistan and three times the size of the presence in Iraq.\u201d Do I hear 100,000?!\n\nHe makes those who saw a new, more dignified Trump look silly. He had to tweet: \u201cMelania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful!\u201d\n\nA new round of recriminations followed. \u201cPresident Donald Trump was condemned on Wednesday after he used his visit to the Pittsburgh synagogue that was the site of a mass shooting to attack the media, tweeting a somber video of his visit along with a caption praising the \u2018great respect\u2019 he received and lashing out at the \u2018fake news.'\u201d The man gives narcissism a bad name.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new about this guy\u2019s behavior; people are just paying more attention. \u201cSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other GOP leaders are facing mounting pressure to speak out and take action against Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) for his public support of white nationalist candidates and racially offensive comments. The pressure comes just days after a deadly shooting in a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh and as King, a staunch conservative and immigration hard-liner, suddenly finds himself in his first competitive race in years.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s something new. \u201cDiplomatic pressure from the United States and Britain, Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest arms suppliers, abruptly intensified on Wednesday for a cease-fire in the Yemen war, the world\u2019s worst man-made humanitarian disaster.\u201d If we stopped selling the Saudis arms, that might help, too.\n\nHe\u2019s not new to the political scene but Vice President Joe Biden is effective. \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden pushed back Wednesday on claims by President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans that the GOP can protect patients with pre-existing conditions better than Democrats, saying Republicans are either lying or \u2018really stupid.'\u201d Or both.\n\nThe new fear is inflation. \u201cIt is a tricky moment for the U.S. economy. Unemployment is at the lowest point in decades, and economic growth is strong. Now inflation is near the Fed\u2019s 2% target, but price rises could pick up if pressure from labor shortages and tariffs intensify in a still-robust economy. Alternatively, other factors could offset these pressures, including the stronger U.S. dollar, which makes imports cheaper.\u201d It is almost as if that huge tax cut was unnecessary.", "\n\nRichard Madden and Keeley Hawes from Season 1 of \u201cBodyguard.\u201d (Netflix)\n\nHow do you make a hit television show about politics? \u201cBodyguard\u201d \u2014 the BBC\u2019s most-watched show for years, now streaming on Netflix \u2014 offers one answer: Mash up the politics with memes from other genres. Part deep-state thriller, part risky romance, part police procedural and, therefore, only partly about politics, \u201cBodyguard\u201d quickens the pulse without unduly troubling the intellect.\n\nIt\u2019s the story of police Sgt. David Budd (played by \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Richard Madden) and the British cabinet minister he is assigned to protect, Home Secretary Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes). Montague, a security hawk, is piloting a sweeping anti-terrorism charter through Parliament. She finds herself under fire, figuratively and indeed literally, from civil libertarians and homegrown terrorists. At the same time, she is pursuing kompromat on the prime minister, whom she aims to shove out of the way so she can grab the post for herself.\n\nBudd\u2019s job is to watch her back, a duty he discharges with a stoic countenance and a staccato serenade of \u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d They distrust each other at first. But as the bombs explode and bullets fly, Budd and Montague become lovers.\n\nPlot twists unfold over the first season\u2019s six episodes. While the conspiracies are many, the details are inessential. \u201cStuff is happening behind the scenes,\u201d says Budd, which pretty much sums it up. Writer Jed Mercurio has made this sort of twist-filled take on public life something of a trademark; his serial police thriller \u201cLine of Duty\u201d is also a runaway hit in Britain.\n\nWhile the plot sometimes plods, the two major players are compelling. Madden portrays Budd, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, much as Daniel Craig has played James Bond \u2014 with cool outward competence that hides private pain. Indeed, rumors have begun to circulate that Madden is being considered to replace Craig in the role. Budd sees the world as full of threat and intrigue. Every face in a crowd must be scanned for hostile intent. Behind every door may lie an ambush. Behind the glass of every meeting room window are conversations he can see but not hear.\n\nThe home secretary herself is the show\u2019s most interesting character. Her motives are unclear: Is she a patriot or a particularly cynical and ambitious politician? The writers give her Blairite foreign policy views \u2014 a sure sign, given the former prime minister\u2019s low reputation in Britain, that she is meant to be read unsympathetically. Having voted for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, now highly unpopular, she offers \u201cno apologies for the past.\u201d Budd at first views her with disdain, as a chicken-hawk. Her staff sees her as a \u201csociopath\u201d and \u201cthe most dangerous person in the country.\u201d\n\nA hit show in Britain does not necessarily translate to the United States, but initial reactions have been positive. Madden\u2019s performance has mostly drawn praise, although New York Times critic Mike Hale found him a bit one-note. Several reviewers saw Budd as a British Carrie Mathison, of Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland,\u201d a security officer hunting down a complex conspiracy. But Budd also has more than a hint of Nick Brody, Mathison\u2019s \u201cHomeland\u201d antagonist, a troubled veteran trying to reintegrate into a society that sent him off to war and then largely forgot about him.\n\nBeyond the Afghanistan/Iraq angle, \u201cBodyguard\u201d mostly steers clear of contemporary British issues. There\u2019s no mention of Brexit; \u201cThat\u2019s a different drama,\u201d Mercurio says. But the show does portray a nation that is ill at ease with itself, that sees threats more readily than opportunities, that is led by a political class that spends most of its time fighting among itself, and that is having a hard time distinguishing truth from fiction. Perhaps, then, this is a show about politics after all.\n\nRead more:\n\nStephen Benedict Dyson is an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut and a contributor to The Monkey Cage.", "Meaza Ashenafi, seen in 2014, was appointed Thursday as Ethiopia\u2019s new Supreme Court president.

Ohio State, Nebraska\u2019s opponent, has not been all that good at stopping said big plays: The Buckeyes' defense ranks 105th in stopping explosive plays on the ground, and 9.4 percent of their opponents' overall plays have gone for at least 20 yards (ranking 108th nationally).

The party needs a net gain of 23 seats to win the majority.\n\nWhile Republicans face significant challenges in holding the House, the dynamics of individual districts and uncertainties about turnout make for a wide range in the potential number of seats Democrats will gain Tuesday.\n\n[Read full poll results | How the battleground survey was conducted]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey of 1,350 likely voters in battleground districts was conducted Oct. 25-28 and is the third wave of interviews in these district this fall by The Post and George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government. Few battleground voters shifted their support over that period, and Democrats\u2019 four-point edge is identical to when these voters were first surveyed in September and early October.\n\nTurnout remains a critical factor in next Tuesday\u2019s balloting, and given past patterns, Democratic turnout is at greater risk of falling short of what the candidates in competitive races might need to win. The party\u2019s current level of support in the poll of battleground districts is fueled by a 21-point advantage among voters under age 40, a 21-point advantage among independents who lean toward neither party and a 40-point advantage among nonwhite voters.\n\nThese groups have turned out at low rates in recent midterm elections. In 2014, 36 percent of eligible African Americans voted, along with 21 percent of Hispanics and 16 percent of people under age 30, according to the United States Elections Project. At the same time, 41 percent of whites cast ballots. And while some voters in these groups express heightened enthusiasm this year, it is unclear how much the electorate\u2019s makeup will shift from previous years. Overall, voters who did not turn out in the 2014 midterms favor Democrats by 55 percent to 42 percent, while those who did vote split 49 percent to 48 percent in Republicans\u2019 favor.\n\nWomen continue to be key to Democratic hopes on Tuesday. White women with college degrees, a high-turnout group, currently favor Democratic House candidates by a 26-point margin, 62 percent to 36 percent. Along with nonwhite women, they contribute to a 12-point Democratic advantage among women overall, 54 percent to 42 percent. Republicans fare better among white women without college degrees, leading 55 percent to 42 percent. And Republicans have a slight three-point edge among men, 50 percent to 47 percent.\n\nRepublicans draw roughly even support with other higher-turnout groups, among them seniors, who currently split 48 percent for Republicans versus 49 percent for Democrats. White voters \u2014 who make up a larger portion of the electorate in battleground districts this year \u2014 narrowly prefer Republican candidates, 51 percent to 47 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president\u2019s increased focus on immigration in the final days of the campaign may find some resonance with voters who will decide control of the House. The Post-Schar School poll finds that 54 percent of voters in battleground district say the \u201cU.S. should do more\u201d than it is currently doing to try to stop illegal immigration across the border with Mexico, while 21 percent support taking less action and 25 percent say the United States is already taking appropriate steps.\n\nAttitudes, however, are sharply partisan, with 84 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying the country should do more to prevent illegal immigration, compared with 23 percent of Democratic-leaning voters. Roughly half of independents say more should be done to deter illegal immigration.\n\nA question about federal efforts to combat climate change found slightly more support for increased action, a position at odds with the Trump administration. A 59 percent majority of likely battleground voters say the United States should do more to try to deal with global warming, while 11 percent say it should do less and 30 percent said the country is doing the right amount. Almost half, 49 percent, say the severity of recent hurricanes are a result of global warming, while 51 percent say they are just the kind of severe weather events that happen from time to time.\n\nAs with global warming, views of which party will take the House split along partisan lines among voters in the battleground districts \u2014 although a number of independent political handicappers currently rate the Democrats as favorites. Asked whether the Democratic Party will take control of the House, 83 percent of Democratic-leaning voters say yes, while 81 percent of Republican-leaning voters think their party will retain control. Pure independents, by 58 percent to 42 percent, predict that Democrats will take control.\n\nThe country\u2019s increasing polarization and the hostile tone of the campaigns set the groundwork for the starkly negative views both parties have of a win by the other side. Roughly 9 in 10 Republican-leaning voters say it would be \u201cbad for the country\u201d if Democrats emerge with a majority in the House, including 67 percent who say it would be \u201cvery bad.\u201d Similarly, more than 9 in 10 Democratic-leaning voters say it would be bad if Republicans maintain control, including 70 percent who see this as \u201cvery bad.\u201d\n\nDemocratic-leaning voters are slightly more positive about winning, however. A 71 percent majority say it would be \u201cvery good\u201d for the country if Democrats retake the House, compared with a smaller 56 percent majority of Republican-leaning voters who say the same about maintaining GOP control of the body.\n\nOn another front, the poll finds battleground voters have been paying significant attention to news about the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi while visiting the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul. A 76 percent majority of likely battleground voters heard or read at least a good amount about the prominent Saudi journalist\u2019s murder.\n\nThe vast majority of battleground district voters who heard at least some news about the issue \u2014 84 percent \u2014 say that Saudi leaders are trying to cover up what happened to Khashoggi. Just 2 percent say top Saudi leaders have honestly disclosed the facts of the case.\n\nWhen asked whether the United States should change its relationship with Saudi Arabia if its leaders ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, a 55 percent majority of voters in battleground districts say the United States should cut back ties with the country. Just under 2 in 10 voters, 19 percent, say the United States should maintain close ties, while more than a quarter say they\u2019re unsure.\n\nThere are large partisan differences on this question. A 74 percent majority of Democratic-leaning battleground voters say the United States should cut back ties if Saudi leaders ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing, compared with 38 percent of Republican-leaning voters saying the same. Some 29 percent of Republicans, following the lead of Trump, say the United States should maintain close ties with the country, while a sizable 33 percent say they are unsure.\n\nWhatever their suspicions of Saudi leaders, voters in battleground districts are split over how Trump is handling the issue, with 52 percent disapproving and 48 percent approving. More voters disapprove strongly (37 percent) than approve strongly (23 percent) of Trump\u2019s performance on this issue.\n\nEmily Guskin and Chris Alcantara contributed to this report.", "\n\nPittsburgh's V'Lique Carter carries for a touchdown against Duke on Saturday. (Matt Freed/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP)\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s new redshirt rule is the gift that keeps on giving to folks who count on the law of unintended consequences to unleash unexpected subplots.\n\nThe rule stipulates a player can retain a year of eligibility (i.e. redshirt) so long as he plays in no more than four games in a season. The old rule required a player to play in less than 30 percent of his team\u2019s games, and none in the second half of the season.\n\nIn late September and early October the rule\u2019s first serious consequence became clear when there was a mini-run of in-season transfers because of displeasure over playing time. Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant was the most prominent player to preserve a year of eligibility.\n\nNow comes the back end: surprise appearances by players held in reserve all season.\n\nEnter V\u2019Lique Carter, a true freshman at Pittsburgh listed as a defensive back . . . until he rushed seven times for 137 yards and two touchdowns Saturday against Duke in his college debut. For those keeping track, that happened in Pitt\u2019s eighth game. (Also, Carter is now categorized as a defensive back/wide receiver on the team roster).\n\nFor the Panthers to preserve Carter\u2019s redshirt, he would need to play in only three of their final four regular season games. And sure enough, Coach Pat Narduzzi said this week it isn\u2019t certain whether Carter will play Friday at Virginia (though a supposed injury concern might be a factor, too). It\u2019s a good bet he will miss at least one of Pitt\u2019s next four games and save a year of eligibility.\n\nCarter is one of the first secret weapons to be unleashed in the latter half of this season. Rest assured he won\u2019t be the last.\n\n[Postcards from College Football America: Five days, four campuses, three games and a memorial]\n\nSpotlight on L.A.\n\nAs underwhelming as the Pac-12 South has been this season, it\u2019s rather amazing both of the division\u2019s Los Angeles schools are getting attention this week.\n\nUCLA (2-6, 2-3) is in the limelight right on schedule. Or rather, because of the schedule. Coach Chip Kelly heads back to Oregon, his old stomping grounds, this weekend and will coach in Autzen Stadium for the first time since leaving Eugene.\n\nAcross town, the immediate results matter more for Clay Helton. The Southern California coach fired offensive line coach Neil Callaway and took away offensive coordinator Tee Martin\u2019s play-calling duties, effectively making a preemptive strike since changes were bound to come in the offseason.\n\nThe Trojans (4-4, 3-3) are bad at a lot of things on offense. They\u2019re 102nd in total offense, 114th in red-zone conversion, 115th in rushing offense and 116th in third-down conversion percentage. And they\u2019re undisciplined (tied for 107th in turnover margin per game, 122nd in penalties per game and 123rd in penalty yards per game). Not good.\n\nDespite this post-Sam Darnold mess, there\u2019s a probability-greater-than-zero chance for Southern Cal to win the South. All it needs is to sweep Oregon State, California and UCLA the next three weeks, get one loss from Arizona State in its next four games and two losses from Utah in its next three games. Not likely, but not impossible.\n\nWho\u2019s left?\n\nRather than fret about rankings, there\u2019s a common-sense way to size up who has even the slightest bit of hope of earning a playoff spot. Thus begins a weekly feature for the rest of the season: a list of every team with even the tiniest sliver of a chance, and it\u2019s as easy as 1-2-3 (or, more accurately, 0-1-2).\n\nSo \u201cWho\u2019s left?\u201d This week, it\u2019s 21 teams.\n\nUndefeated teams that won\u2019t be left out if they run the table (3): Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame\n\nOne-loss teams with varying degrees of earning a playoff berth if they win out (8): Georgia, Kentucky, LSU, Michigan, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Washington State and West Virginia.\n\nWill need plenty of help even if they win out (10): Boston College, Central Florida, Florida, Iowa, N.C. State, Penn State, Syracuse, Texas, Utah and Virginia\n\nThe last group includes every two-loss power conference team remaining this season. Oh, and Central Florida, the only undefeated Group of Five team which, fairly or not, is going to require a ton of chaos to have a serious shot.\n\n[Alabama, Clemson take usual places atop College Football Playoff rankings, but it gets fun after that]\n\nClinching time already?\n\nNovember has just arrived, but one of December\u2019s biggest games might be set by the time everyone turns their clocks back an hour early Sunday morning.\n\nOnly two of the 20 spots in conference title games can be clinched this weekend, but both of them are in the SEC. Georgia (7-1, 5-1) visits Kentucky (7-1, 5-1), and the winner will head to Atlanta on Dec. 1 regardless of what happens in their final league game. Both teams have already defeated Florida, the only other SEC East team that can get to 6-2.\n\nOver in the West, Alabama (8-0, 5-0) will clinch the division with a victory at LSU (7-1, 4-1). That would give the Crimson Tide victories over both the Tigers and Texas A&M, and thus the tiebreaker over the only other SEC West teams with two or fewer SEC losses.\n\nFive to watch\n\nGeorgia at Kentucky (3:30, CBS): The host Wildcats are coming off an unusual 15-14 defeat of Missouri in which they didn\u2019t score a touchdown on offense until an untimed down to close out the fourth quarter. Still, it\u2019s been a once-in-a-generation(-or-two) season in Lexington, and Kentucky will try to knock off the SEC favorite Bulldogs behind running back Benny Snell.\n\nWest Virginia at Texas (3:30, Fox): The winner keeps at least a share of the Big 12 lead for at least another week. The Mountaineers (6-1, 4-1) throttled Baylor as they came out of their open date last Thursday, while Texas (6-2, 4-1) saw its six-game winning streak end with a surprising 38-35 loss at Oklahoma State.\n\nPenn State at Michigan (3:45, ESPN): The Wolverines\u2019 payback tour \u2014 which has already netted victories over Michigan State and Wisconsin \u2014 continues as the Nittany Lions (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten) arrive at the Big House. Michigan (7-1, 5-0) hasn\u2019t lost since an opening-week setback against Notre Dame thanks to a stellar defense that leads in the nation in total yards and passing yards allowed.\n\nNotre Dame at Northwestern (7:15, ESPN): The Fighting Irish (8-0) pay their first visit to Evanston since 1976 to take on the Wildcats (5-3), who have won four in a row overall and (improbably) their past two meetings with Notre Dame (in 1995 and 2014).\n\nAlabama at LSU (8, CBS): Both teams come off open dates to meet in a crucial SEC West game in Death Valley. The Crimson Tide (8-0, 5-0) has won seven in a row in the series, with the Tigers (7-1, 4-1) mustering a total of 73 points during the skid. One streak will definitely continue; the winner of each of the past 12 meetings have been ranked in the top five nationally.\n\nRead more college football coverage:\n\nMaryland board of regents facing pressure from lawmakers after DJ Durkin decision\n\nJosh Heupel keeps UCF football on the fast track after his career hit a speed bump\n\nUrban Meyer coping with pain from brain cyst but intends to keep coaching Ohio State\n\nRutgers football player arrested on charges of attempted double-murder\n\nTen years ago, Dabo Swinney came in from the fringes to lead Clemson", "To hear President Trump tell it (and you can, in the video above), he is way ahead of the game on just about any policy question he is asked about, regardless of whether he has a realistic plan for handling said policy.\n\nLess than one week into office, Trump told ABC News he would announce his decision about reopening CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d in \u201ctwo hours.\u201d Ten days later, the White House backed off the proposal.\n\nIn February 2017, Trump said he was \u201clooking at\u201d both a two-state and a one-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

(Charles Fox/Philadelphia Inquirer/AP)\n\nAnti-Semitism hadn\u2019t occupied a large share of headlines in the campaign before Saturday\u2019s Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that left 11 Jewish people dead. But in the week ahead of the midterms, some of the nearly 60 Jewish congressional candidates \u2014 believed to be among the largest number in history \u2014 are pivoting to discuss the topic that has drawn attention since the tragedy.\n\nOf course, anti-Semitism isn\u2019t new, but something has recently changed, Rep. Alan Lowenthal (D.-Calif.) told The Fix:\n\n\u201cIt has always been there, but I think what happened and changed in the last year and a half has allowed some of the most disturbed elements to take it to the next level and to step up, and that\u2019s kind of frightening.\n\n\u201cAnd the present administration has certainly not helped by polarizing us and putting us into camps,\u201d he added.

This was the case even among those conservatives running for seats that they are certainly sure to win \u2014 and thus a reminder that avoiding an attack on Trump, no matter what, is seen as the wisest political strategy for some Republicans.\n\nAfter Trump blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d \u2014 white nationalists and counterprotesting activists \u2014 for the deadly violence during the 2017 protest in Charlottesville, many Jewish lawmakers condemned Trump\u2019s comments. But Rep. Lee Zeldin (R.-N.Y.), a Trump supporter, defended the president\u2019s response. He told the Times of Israel:\n\n\u201cI would add, though, that it is not right to suggest that President Trump is wrong for acknowledging the fact that criminals on both sides showed up for the purpose of being violent. That particular observation is completely true.\u201d\n\nJewish lawmakers have been among both Trump\u2019s biggest critics and supporters \u2014 with those on the left being critical and Republicans generally supporting him. While some, like Zeldin, have aligned themselves closely with the president due to his stances on Israel and illegal immigration, others such as Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) have frequently appeared on cable television to challenge the president\u2019s rhetoric toward minority groups along with his relationship with leaders of Russia, North Korea and other countries.\n\nBut if the pushback against Trump in this cultural moment seems particularly hard, perhaps it is because so many lawmakers on the left seem more willing to tie Trump\u2019s rhetoric to the actions of the massacre suspect, Robert Bowers. This is not all that surprising considering how Jewish Americans historically vote, especially in the most recent election, when more than 7 in 10 Jewish voters chose Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe president\u2019s doubling down on his rhetoric in the days following the tragedy may put the Jewish lawmakers who consistently support him on the defensive as they try to explain their support for Trump.\n\nResponses from Republican Jewish lawmakers and candidates steered away from attacking Trump and more generally spoke out against hate.\n\nRoberta and I are heartbroken to hear of the tragedy that occurred this morning at the Tree of Life synagogue.

At the time of the shootings, Bracamontes was in the United States illegally \u2014 and now, with the midterm election approaching, he\u2019s the star of the GOP\u2019s latest campaign ad.\n\n\u201cIllegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!\u201d reads text on the 53-second video, which is filled with audible expletives. \u201cDemocrats let him into our country. . . . Democrats let him stay.\u201d\n\nThe text is superimposed over videos of Bracamontes appearing to show no remorse for his crimes, and even declaring, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill more cops soon.\u201d\n\nMore footage follows: Throngs of unidentified people rioting in unidentified streets and pushing down fences in undisclosed locations.

Horton escaped while on furlough and in April 1987, he raped a white woman and stabbed her white fiance.\n\nThe \u201cRevolving Door\u201d TV ad accusing Dukakis of being soft on crime showed convicts coming in and out of prison through a revolving door made of prison bars, and was meant to allude to Horton, Rolling Stone reported. The ad was largely masterminded by Roger Ailes, who founded Fox News Channel in 1996.\n\n\u201cThe only question is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand \u2014 or without it,\u201d Ailes once told a reporter, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nAnother ad called \u201cWeekend Passes,\u201d run by the National Political Action Committee, took things a step further and included Horton\u2019s mug shot. That ad was created by Larry McCarthy, who had worked under Ailes for six years during the 1980s, the New Yorker reported.\n\n\u201cThis was a classic example of racial cuing,\u201d Claire Jean Kim, a political-science professor at the University of California at Irvine, said in a 2012 PBS special. \u201cThe insinuation is, if you elect Governor Dukakis as president, we\u2019re going to have black rapists running amok in the country. It\u2019s playing to white fears about black crime.\u201d\n\nWhether it was simply an attempt to criticize Dukakis\u2019s crime policies or if it was an appeal to racial fears, the \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ads worked. \u201cWillie Horton was devastating to Mr. Dukakis,\u201d the New York Times wrote in 1990.\n\nKim, who described the ad\u2019s strategy as \u201cincredibly effective\u201d and \u201cmasterful,\u201d said even decades later, it still \u201csets the bar for racial cuing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCandidates talk about not wanting to be Willie Hortonized,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Wednesday, critics slammed Trump and Republicans for promoting what was described as a \u201cWillie Horton redux\u201d by both CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo and the New Republic, a left-leaning magazine.\n\n\u201cThis may be the most desperate and vile ad since Willie Horton,\u201d tweeted former Labor Secretary Robert Reich.\n\nThis may be the most desperate and vile ad since Willie Horton. Trump and Republicans don't want to talk about the fact that they plan to repeal the ACA, gut Social Security, Medicare, & Medicaid, and cut taxes even further for their donors, so they've resorted to fearmongering. https://t.co/xaXNThEOfb \u2014 Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 31, 2018\n\nThirty years ago, George H.W.

His anti-immigration stance was critical to his success during the 2016 presidential campaign and \u201che is counting on similarly inflammatory words and images to help the GOP hold its congressional majorities,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Seung Min Kim reported. Just this week, Trump publicly vowed to end birthright citizenship and said he would deploy as many as 15,000 active-duty troops to the border.\n\nConservative commentator Scott Jennings told Cuomo that he wasn\u2019t surprised by the ad.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything in this video that I haven\u2019t heard from the president consistently for the past couple of years,\u201d Jennings said. But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s not the message I would be closing the campaign on.\u201d\n\nLemon echoed his fellow anchor when rebuking the ad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a naked appeal to fear and hate, and it is racist,\u201d he said.\n\nDouglas Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University, brought up Willie Horton on Lemon\u2019s show, noting that although the 1988 ad was effective in the sense that Bush won the election, it did little to help the former president\u2019s personal image.\n\n\u201cThe Willie Horton ad gave George Herbert Walker Bush his one big black eye in history,\u201d Brinkley said.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nPolice believe a Ferguson protester\u2019s son killed himself.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump is fond of asserting that \u201c Collusion is not a crime, but that [it] doesn\u2019t matter because there was No Collusion .\u201d Signs are gathering that both of those claims may be challenged by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. As longtime criminal law practitioners, we believe that the first indictment of someone within Trump\u2019s inner circle could be imminent for collusion-related crimes of the kind we detail in a new report. If such charges are filed, that would have profound consequences for those around Trump, the president himself and for our democracy.\n\nThat target appears to be Roger Stone, the political provocateur and longtime Trump confidante. Stone himself has said he believes he may be indicted , declaring that \u201cRobert S. Mueller III is coming for me\u201d and raising legal defense funds. In our view, he has ample reason for concern. Mueller has already issued two indictments laying out the Russian attack on our democracy, and one of those indictments seems to point to Stone as \u201ca person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump\u201d who had discussions with a Russian operative using the handle \u201cGuccifer 2.0.\u201d Stone has acknowledged that he is likely the person named in the indictment. And just last week Mueller reportedly interviewed former Trump campaign chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon about Stone\u2019s private statements regarding WikiLeaks and the emails it later released.\n\nStone forcefully denies any wrongdoing. In response to questions from The Washington Post, he said that \u201cif the decision is based on evidence, facts and truth, no charges will be brought against me.\u201d\n\nBut Mueller may not agree. Portents that an indictment could issue soon also include the recent grand jury appearances of Stone associates. There reportedly has been testimony by Randy Credico, who may have been a conduit between Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and Jerome Corsi, who may have been called to testify about information he shared with Stone . Others around Stone were issued grand jury subpoenas to appear as well, including one who refused to comply and has been held in contempt .\n\nIn our near-century of combined criminal law experience, all these indicators point to potential charges. Indeed, but for the Justice Department\u2019s practice of avoiding indictments that could affect an election in the 60-day window before balloting, the Stone indictment might have been issued already. When that blackout period ends, Mueller may be ready to move.\n\n[Trump's real problem is that he obstructed justice, and Mueller can prove it. Here's how.]\n\nThat is when things will get interesting. With each indictment, the special counsel is inching closer and closer to the president. Stone spoke regularly to Trump for years , worked for Trump on the campaign for a time and continued to communicate with him thereafter, including when Trump ascended to the White House. It will be much harder for Trump to continue his two-pronged collusion denials if someone as close to him as Stone is indicted.\n\nThe risk to the president would deepen if Stone chose to cooperate. Stone is defiant now. But so was Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Manafort was willing to see the fight through to conviction on eight separate counts before he finally acceded to the possibility that even with a potential pardon, he might be better off playing ball with the special counsel\u2019s office. He has reportedly met with them nine times in the past four weeks to proffer what he knows.\n\nThat is not just a precedent. It is also a pressure point: Manafort is a longtime Stone associate as well. He surely has been questioned about his knowledge of any Russia-related communications by or with Stone, including ones involving candidate Trump or those around him.\n\n[Trump's lawyer say he's above the law. They clearly don't understand it.]\n\nIf Stone were to cooperate, he could have much to say. We know that Trump campaign officials had at least 87 reported contacts with Russia-linked individuals and officials during the 2016 election cycle. Among those was the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Russian nationals and senior members of the campaign in June 2016, for which Donald Trump Jr. was promised \u201cinformation that would incriminate\u201d Hillary Clinton, and to which he responded, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\u201d That was, of course, when the stolen Democratic National Committee email was released \u2014 and Mueller, it seems, has already alleged that Stone had contacts with a Russian entity involved (though Stone says those contacts all came after the initial release of the emails).\n\nAfter next week\u2019s election, Mueller could also ratchet up the pressure on Trump by producing his report on collusion or obstruction of justice. On the former, the special counsel has reportedly turned his focus to Trump, submitting questions to him to answer in writing. On the latter, there is already substantial evidence of presidential obstruction . Speculation has been intense that an obstruction report could also drop after the 60-day election blackout ends.\n\nThe president is not one to passively await these legal walls closing in on him. He has wild cards of his own to play: Media reports and congressional observers alike suggest that after the midterm elections, Trump will clean house at Justice. He could fire Mueller\u2019s supervisor, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, replacing him with a crony who will choke off the investigation. A new supervisor could potentially even go so far as to bar the special counsel from filing indictments or block him from disclosing his findings to Congress or the public.\n\nOr Trump could leave Rosenstein in place but seek to take away his supervisory authority by firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The deputy attorney general oversees Mueller only because the attorney general had a conflict owing to his ties to Trump. Any new attorney general should also recuse, given the president\u2019s many statements that he expects his attorney general to protect him. But whomever the president chooses might not take that ethically necessary step. If the attorney general is replaced by a Trump crony, he or she might seek to assume oversight of Mueller, or even claim the special counsel is no longer needed \u2014 an outcome the president, too, could try to order. Like Richard Nixon\u2019s Saturday Night Massacre, those outcomes would threaten a constitutional crisis, with the president taking steps to put himself above the rule of law.\n\n[Trump or Congress could still block Mueller's investigation. I know. I wrote the rules.]\n\nOf course, we do not know whether Mueller\u2019s implacable forward motion in the direction of the president will lead to a collision with the president\u2019s open hostility to the investigation. Trump may back down from stimulating a crisis, as he has done before . But if the weeks after the election bring a Stone indictment and perhaps one or more Mueller reports, tensions could well intensify, if not erupt into outright conflict.\n\nUltimately, though, the real power doesn\u2019t belong only to Mueller or Trump. It also resides with members of Congress, and the voters who put them there. The majority leadership in Congress has failed to hold Trump accountable. The House has particularly abdicated its oversight role. If it remains led by those in his own party who have repeatedly turned a blind eye to Trump and his administration, he may take that as license to do as he pleases. Conversely, if the election results in at least one body of Congress in a position to exercise real oversight, that may check the president\u2019s willingness to provoke a constitutional clash. He will know that if he disrupts the investigation, there is an authority beyond his control that can take it over.\n\nWith voting less than a week away \u2014 and already well in progress in many states \u2014 the outcome of the looming clash appears to reside exactly where it belongs in a democracy: with the American people.", "Russia's flag flutters in front of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn, Estonia, on March 27, 2018.

More recently, they were implicated in the poisoning in March of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter in Salisbury, England. The Kremlin denies any role.\n\nBut Estonia\u2019s experience as Russian spy hunter is now entering the spotlight. Allies are paying attention to Estonia\u2019s efforts to publicly expose alleged espionage, as well as its dossiers documenting the methods apparently used by GRU agents.\n\n\n\nA man sits on the western bank of the Narva River below Hermann Castle, left, and opposite Ivangorod Fortress, which is on the Russian side the river, in Narva, Estonia.

A trail of damning evidence was left, including a taxi receipt showing the GRU\u2019s Moscow headquarters and alleged agents traveling together on consecutively numbered Russian passports.\n\nBob Seely, a lawmaker on Britain\u2019s foreign affairs committee, described the apparent espionage as \u201cvery sloppy\u201d and said it makes Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201clook foolish.\u201d\n\nBut Estonia sees it differently.\n\nEstonian officials describe the GRU, formally now called the GU, as operating with a certain measure of bravado and machismo. \u201cA gung-ho group in the sense of \u2018We\u2019ll do what we do, and to hell with it,\u2019 \u201d according to Ilves.\n\nThe GRU, one of Russia\u2019s three intelligence services, has traditionally operated without the public profile or accolades bestowed upon Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, the SVR, or the FSB, its domestic security service and successor to the KGB.\n\nUntil President Barack Obama called out the agency in 2016 for election interference, the GRU was rarely mentioned by foreign governments \u2014 let alone its individual agents named.\n\nThe poisoning of Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, was a turning point for the West, Estonian officials said.\n\nThen, on Oct. 4, the British and Dutch governments forcefully condemned what they said were hacking and disinformation operations by GRU agents.\n\nCapping off that day were charges by the U.S. Justice Department against seven GRU officers accused of leaking athletes\u2019 drug-test data, as well as efforts to steal information from organizations investigating Russia\u2019s alleged use of chemical weapons.\n\nPhotos and names were released, leading Western and Russian journalists to uncover new details about the agents.\n\n[U.S. and its allies target Russian cyber spies with indictments, public shaming]\n\nThe flurry of activity followed indictments this year by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, accusing 12 GRU members of hacking and leaking the emails of Democratic officials and organizations. The indictments were part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nAssuming Moscow\u2019s agents are incompetent or amateurish could prove dangerous, experts said. On the whole, GRU members carry out successful missions, and those who are caught are largely seen as collateral damage for the Russian state.\n\n\u201cThe fear of getting caught doesn\u2019t deter them from doing a nasty job,\u201d said Kalev Stoicescu, a fellow at the International Center for Defense and Security in Estonia and a former Defense Ministry official. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for Russia.

This [exposure of their operations] is kind of a byproduct.\u201d\n\nFormer and current Estonian officials said that the GRU quickly regroups after its agents are exposed.\n\n\u201cGRU is characterized by their distinct robustness; they\u2019re not too sophisticated,\u201d said Lauri Lepik, formerly Estonia\u2019s ambassador to the United States and NATO.\n\nLepik is no stranger to high-profile espionage. He said he had the \u201cunfortunate privilege\u201d in 2008 of facing the diplomatic backlash that followed the arrest of Herman Simm, former head of a security unit inside Estonia\u2019s Defense Ministry who kept his intelligence ties with Moscow after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nSimm leaked sensitive NATO intelligence and the names of Western spies to Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service. He is serving a 12-year sentence for treason.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about operational security,\u201d Lepik said. \u201cThey would just try, and if they fail, try again.\u201d\n\nEstonians decided the best strategy was to expose suspected agents and send a clear message to Moscow. When a father-and-son pair were arrested in September in Tallinn, Estonia\u2019s capital, on suspicion of passing military secrets to the GRU, Estonian authorities sprang into action.\n\nDeniss Metsavas, 38 \u2014 a major in the Estonian Defense Forces \u2014 and his father, Pjotr Volin, 65, were taken into custody separately.

Instead, he framed his opponent\u2019s association with far-right figures abroad and his inflammatory statements at home as an abdication of leadership, noting that King was not named to the cross-chamber committee hashing out the terms of the farm bill, which is critical to a district where agriculture is king.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get into name-calling,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely disgusted with a lot of what he stands for, but I didn\u2019t run for Congress to call him anything. It\u2019s not my place to do it. I\u2019ll let the voters decide on what\u2019s appropriate and not appropriate. I\u2019m not the one who defines what a racist is.\u201d\n\n[Land O'Lakes withdraws support for GOP Rep. Steve King after boycott calls]\n\nHis restraint points to a different tack in a campaign season convulsed by debates over identity \u2014 debates that have driven the two parties further apart. Examples abound. Georgia could elect the country\u2019s first female African American governor, who is a Democrat, or the Republican, who has pledged to \u201cround up \u2018illegals.\u2019 \u201d The Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona said her opponent, who is bisexual, supported \u201ctreason\u201d because of comments she had made about war in the Middle East. In Vermont, Democrats made Christine Hallquist the country\u2019s first openly transgender major-party nominee for governor, as the Trump administration considers narrowly defining gender as linked to biological sex.\n\nThe divisions are stark, and some Democrats have tried to use them to their advantage. \"I\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist,\u201d concluded Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor in Florida, during a heated debate last month, referring to a record of statements dogging his Republican opponent, Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\nScholten \u2014 who, unlike Gillum, is white \u2014 said he doesn\u2019t feel the need to level such a blunt accusation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m uncomfortable. I believe the district needs new, moral leadership from someone who unequivocally rejects white nationalism and racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel things are clear. It doesn\u2019t matter what I say one way or the other. He is who he is. It speaks for itself.\"\n\nRep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the chairman of the House Republican campaign arm, on Tuesday assailed King for \u201cwhite supremacy and hate,\u201d and the fundraising group he heads said it wouldn\u2019t \u201cplay\u201d in King\u2019s race. Land O\u2019Lakes, the dairy giant, pulled its financial support the same day, citing the \u201ccompany\u2019s values.\u201d\n\nAnd on Wednesday, another Republican, Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, said on MSNBC that he would never vote for \u201csomeone like Steve King,\u201d even if it meant forfeiting control of the House, calling his colleague\u2019s statements and actions \u201cdisgusting.\u201d The same day, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, called on House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to censure King for statements and affiliations \u201cthat are anti-Semitic and offensive not just to the Jewish community, but to all Americans.\u201d Ryan did not do so.\n\nThe harsh reproach enforced a degree of accountability for King. But his hard-line views on race and cultural identity have moved further into the mainstream during the presidency of Donald Trump, who has aimed to make the final days of the midterm campaign about polarizing issues of immigration and national belonging. King, an eight-term congressman, parroted the president\u2019s rhetoric in responding to the criticism, blaming the \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cEstablishment Never Trumpers.\"\n\nA poll released Tuesday by Change Research, a Democratic firm, found that King had only a one-point lead over Scholten, a first-time candidate. David Wasserman, Cook\u2019s House editor, said Scholten was King\u2019s \u201cfirst credible challenger in six years.\u201d He has massively outraised the incumbent, his campaign coffers lined by contributions from national donors \u2014 from Florida to Texas to Massachusetts \u2014 some of whom view King as a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and a \u201cbigot.\u201d\n\nScholten has forcefully denounced King\u2019s comments and has called on Republicans to join him. But the lifelong Democrat, who has worked as a paralegal in Minneapolis and Seattle, is speaking to a specific audience. Since 2012, King has been reelected multiple times in a district where voters favored Trump to Hillary Clinton roughly 2 to 1.\n\nThe candidate has left the sharper barbs to the American Values PAC, a group targeting King and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. One ad called King \u201cKlan and neo-Nazi approved.\u201d\n\nThat enables Scholten to present himself as a \u201chealthy alternative,\u201d as he described his campaign in a phone interview from the road north of Sioux City, the city of about 80,000 where he grew up.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Nebraska and pursued professional baseball, playing abroad as well as for his hometown team, the Sioux City Explorers. He stands at 6 foot 6 but never made it to the major leagues.\n\nBetween seasons, Scholten began a career as a paralegal. But he moved home nearly two years ago, at the encouragement of his grandmother, who asked him to take over the family farm shortly before she died. When the farm passed to his mother\u2019s generation, Scholten returned and purchased his family home from his parents. The best job he could find paid $15 an hour and came without benefits, so he created a position of his own, as a freelance paralegal.\n\nMeanwhile, a candidate willing to take on King had yet to emerge. \u201cThat\u2019s when I was like, \u2018You know what, I cannot let Steve King just go without an opponent,\u2019\u201d he said. He announced his candidacy last summer.\n\nScholten said he has visited each of the district\u2019s 39 counties at least three times. Residents, he said, weren\u2019t worried about birthright citizenship or the migrant caravan heading toward the southern border. \u201cKitchen-table topics,\u201d such as health care, were at the center of conversations. People in the district want border security, he said, but the area also has a labor shortage. A grain elevator recently needed 39 employees to help with the harvest, \u201cand they didn\u2019t get one American citizen to apply,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a deep-red district, he is running as an outsider and a populist. He has the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as that of the Sioux City Journal, which has favored King in the past.\n\n\u201cThe average person in Congress is 58 years old, with a net worth of $1 million,\u201d Scholten said in an ad from earlier this year. \u201cWell, I\u2019m different. I\u2019m 20 years younger and just shy of $1 million short of that average.\u201d\n\nHe dared viewers, \u201cTell me this race is unwinnable.\u201d\n\nNational Democrats long saw it that way, he said. Before this week\u2019s poll, King was recently shown to have anywhere from a six to a 20-point lead. \u201cFor the longest time, I\u2019ve been trying to scream to say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re on pace to beat this guy,' and nobody was making much noise about it,\u201d Scholten said.\n\nHe sees some signs of change. His campaign manager texted him Wednesday to say that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has faced criticism for discounting progressive candidates, had \"responded with more than just a sentence this time,\u201d Scholten said.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nTrump revives \u2018Willie Horton\u2019 with ad linking illegal immigrant killer to Democrats\n\nPolice believe a Ferguson protester\u2019s son killed himself.

Labor issues and labor rights have come under tighter government scrutiny, prompting one U.S. university to suspend two of its academic exchange programs in China. (AP)\n\nOn Oct. 20, Cornell University\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR) suspended two exchange programs with China\u2019s Renmin University, citing principles of academic freedom. At issue were reports from Renmin students that the university had cracked down on student groups advocating worker rights.\n\nI reached out to Eli Friedman, associate professor and director of Cornell ILR international programs, to learn more about the academic exchanges and the experience teaching about labor issues in China. What follows is a lightly edited version of our conversation.\n\nJessica Chen Weiss: What was the nature of the exchanges you suspended between Cornell and Renmin University, and what had they been intended to achieve?\n\nEli Friedman: We suspended two undergraduate exchange programs, one with Renmin\u2019s School of Labor and Human Resources (SLHR) and the other with the business school. The exchange with the labor school launched in 2013, and eight to 10 students would spend about a month in Beijing in the summer, while Cornell would host a smaller number of Renmin students for the fall semester. The exchange with the business school was less robust, with a handful of students participating in recent years. Cornell has other engagements at Renmin and elsewhere in China that were not affected by this decision.\n\nThe exchange made sense. ILR is considered the top U.S. labor school, and Renmin\u2019s SLHR the top labor school in China. Our students gained exposure to an elite Chinese university in Beijing. I was very impressed with the intellect and inquisitiveness of the Renmin students who came to Ithaca.\n\nJCW: What would it take to restore meaningful exchanges?\n\nEF: We remain open to resuming these exchanges because they benefit students at both universities. But we need to be confident that the environment for academic freedom has improved. Specifically, we would want to see concrete evidence that students studying at Renmin, regardless of their country of origin, will be able to freely investigate, debate and express their opinions on a range of issues \u2014 including labor conflicts. This needs to happen in an environment free of coercion, surveillance and the threat of punishment.\n\n[A more assertive Beijing raises new questions for U.S.-China relations]\n\nSome issues in China have always been extremely sensitive and generally off limits in a college classroom, e.g., the Tiananmen massacre, Tibetan independence or challenging Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule. When we started the exchange, this was not the case for labor issues. I could give public lectures in Chinese that basically did not differ from a lecture I might give in the U.S.\n\nThis kind of space does not exist anymore, and that diminishes the program\u2019s educational value. Cornell needs to ensure that our partner institutions maintain the same standards of academic excellence \u2014 and the academic freedom to discuss complex social and political problems.\n\nJCW: What\u2019s the biggest takeaway for academics?\n\nEF: Foreign institutions have long hoped that engagement and quiet diplomacy in China would eventually lead to an expansion in academic, and possibly political, freedoms. It is increasingly clear that precisely the opposite has happened. In the Renmin case, the university has actively suppressed speech, engaged in widespread surveillance and punishment of student activists, and even been complicit in forcibly detaining one of their own students. This is a qualitative shift from earlier forms of censorship, in which students and faculty carefully danced around off-limits topics.\n\nThe CCP has become increasingly repressive. Suspending programs with Chinese universities is by no means the only response, but we might need to become louder about our defense of academic freedom. If Beijing continues to ignore quiet diplomacy, we\u2019ll need to think seriously about other tools to exert pressure to open up space for academic freedom. The actions we took at Cornell ILR may or may not turn out to be effective, but doing nothing was not an option.\n\nJCW: What does China\u2019s crackdown on labor organizing reveal about its commitment to Communist and Marxist principles?\n\nEF: Even going back to the 1950s, the CCP has consistently seen workers \u2014 and student-worker alliances \u2014 as the greatest threat to its monopoly on power. This distrust of the proletariat has only intensified in the reform era as inequality has soared and the state has been enriched by its alliance with private capital. This is not to say the government has done nothing for workers: Indeed, the legal protections afforded to employees are relatively strong, if frequently unenforced. But discussions of exploitation, class power or worker resistance are off limits.\n\n[China is reportedly hacking computer motherboards. The economic fallout could be huge.]\n\nAs we have seen with the repression of the \u201ceight young leftists\u201d as well as the students supporting the unionizing efforts by workers at the Jasic Technology factory, Beijing does not hesitate to crack down on self-identified Maoists or Marxists if they pose a political threat. Perhaps the state is particularly discomfited by these young activists precisely because they embody the Marxist principles the CCP has long since abandoned in practice.\n\nJCW: Some U.S. analysts have concluded that policies of engagement with China have failed. Based on your own experience and research, would you agree or disagree with this view?\n\nEF: I can respond to this based on my experiences in Chinese universities as well as efforts I\u2019ve made to engage with the official All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). With respect to both of these institutions, I have concluded that foreign engagement has had no demonstrable impact when it comes to advancing democratic possibilities.\n\n[China is weaponizing online distraction]\n\nI should note that this is a 180-degree reversal from where I was in 2006, when as a grad student I argued passionately that the U.S. labor movement\u2019s historical refusal to engage with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was a relic of the Cold War. I participated in numerous local/national exchanges over the years between U.S. and Chinese trade unions. But the ACFTU under Xi Jinping has become remarkably more conservative, more hostile to worker involvement, and unwilling to consider reforms to formal arbitration and collective-bargaining arrangements.\n\nIn 2008-2009, while doing fieldwork in Guangzhou, I was actively involved in a joint labor research center between UC Berkeley and Sun Yat-sen University. For a few years, the center flourished, bringing in great students, conducting cutting-edge research and gaining international prestige for the university. But the center closed in 2015, when university administrators falsely accused the director of being in cahoots with the U.S. government.\n\nLabor scholarship is in serious crisis in today\u2019s China, but in more broad terms, we need to be realistic about what might come from academic engagement. In the best cases, we would hope to see mutually beneficial research collaborations, enlightening intellectual exchange and educational opportunities for students. Unfortunately, the scope of topics deemed off-limits continues to increase \u2014 and that will decrease these opportunities in more and more fields.", "Abdullah, who declined to give his last name, is a vendor of fragrant agarwood. \u201cThe crown prince is making everything better; I am in favor of everything he does,\u201d Abdullah said Oct. 26, 2018, in the rural town of Ad Dilam, Saudi Arabia. (Kevin Sullivan/The Washington Post)\n\nDozens of men filed out of the mosque and across the street to the weekly vegetable market, where farmer Saleh Othman al-Haqbani was selling scallions from the back of his pickup truck.\n\nRashid al-Awadin walked up, and the two men pressed their noses together in a traditional greeting popular here in this rural farm town, in the hot scrublands 70 miles south of the capital city, Riyadh.\n\n\u201cLife is good here because our crown prince is always working hard for us and making our life better,\u201d Awadin, 50, a retired soldier, told a visitor as he paid for his onions. \u201cI support him, and nothing is going to change that, no matter what. I will follow his lead as long as he is alive.\u201d\n\nThe slaying \u2014 and reported dismemberment \u2014 of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the Saudi government acknowledges was a premeditated killing carried out by Saudi agents, has triggered international outrage.\n\nWidespread suspicion that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the plot to kill a frequent critic \u2014 which the Saudi government vehemently denies \u2014 has darkened previously rosy perceptions of the powerful young prince in Washington and Europe. The Trump administration has imposed visa restrictions on the agents implicated in the killing and is considering more sanctions.\n\nBut in this patch of Saudi Arabia far from the big cities, people interviewed at al-Diyrra market said the incident was tragic but distant from their daily lives. Most said they were aware of it, although at least one person said he had not heard about it. Every person interviewed said he refused to believe Mohammed was involved.\n\n\n\nFarmer Saleh Othman al-Haqbani, left, sells scallions and other produce from the back of his pickup at the Friday market in ad-Dilam. Here he sells to Yahya al-Obili. Both support Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and reject the notion that he had anything to do with the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. (Kevin Sullivan/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cNo one believes these stupid things,\u201d said Haqbani, 51, the onion vendor. \u201cIf he wanted to kill him, he could have brought him back here. But he is way bigger than that. And he is way smarter.\u201d\n\nAnother of his customers, Yahya al-Obili, 55, overheard the conversation about Khashoggi and added that Mohammed\u2019s suspected involvement \u201cmakes no sense. It\u2019s just what the media is saying.\u201d Obili said an accident must have caused Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nTurkish officials have said they have audio recording that proves Khashoggi was killed and his body dismembered. Turkey said the killing was carried out Oct. 2 inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by Saudis who flew to Istanbul that day. Khashoggi, who contributed columns to The Washington Post\u2019s Global Opinions section, made a scheduled visit to the consulate to pick up documents related to his marriage plans. Saudi authorities have arrested 18 people and fired five officials, including two who were close to the crown prince.\n\n\u201cMaybe he had a stroke,\u201d Obili said of Khashoggi, who had been living in self-imposed exile in Virginia. \u201cI don\u2019t think the crown prince would leave his important work to order the killing of one man.\u201d\n\nIn general, Saudis are hesitant to criticize Mohammed, whose government has routinely jailed human rights activists, clerics, business leaders and even royal relatives who have dared to criticize or defy him. Human rights groups and others \u2014 including some Saudis speaking in private \u2014 describe a climate of fear in which people dread being arrested for even slightly crossing the prince, who is just 33 and has consolidated an unprecedented amount of power in his hands.\n\nSome foreign critics have said Mohammed no longer has the moral standing to be crown prince and should be removed by King Salman, his father, and some Saudis privately wish for that also. But many commentators have said that the removal of MBS, as he is commonly known, is highly unlikely and that most Saudis prefer stability over the upheaval that might come with removing him.\n\nA former Western diplomat in Riyadh said that he has seen almost no appetite in Saudi Arabia for removing the crown prince and that Saudis resent outside pressure in the Khashoggi case. He said that was especially true in rural areas, where support for the monarchy is strong.\n\n\u201cSaudis of nearly all stripes are circling the wagons against a hostile world they see as unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cNearly everyone says, \u2018Who will replace MBS and keep the reforms moving forward?\u2019 Quite honestly, their biggest fear is that something happens to him, leaving a vacuum and chaos.\u201d\n\nAt the weekly market, held under a canvas tent next to the crumbling remains of the city\u2019s old sandstone walls, support for Mohammed was robust. Most people pointed to concrete ways in which Mohammed had improved life for them here, far from the major business hubs of Riyadh and Jiddah. Almost everyone interviewed said he was grateful for Mohammed\u2019s program of social and economic reforms, called Vision 2030.\n\nA billboard on the town\u2019s main shopping street features photos of Mohammed and the king and thanks them for Mohammed\u2019s efforts to modernize Saudi society and diversify the economy away from oil.\n\nIn interviews in the past two weeks, Riyadh residents cited Mohammed\u2019s dramatic steps legalizing cinemas and other entertainment venues, providing more jobs for women and allowing them to drive, and stripping power from the religious police and removing them from shopping malls, which they once patrolled.\n\nBut those interviewed in Ad Dilam highlighted more quotidian benefits: better roads, a new college campus, a new shopping center, and an administrative restructuring that has provided bigger budgets and more government attention to a town that long felt left behind. They said those improvements feel more immediately relevant to their lives than the killing of a journalist in Turkey \u2014 which they insisted had nothing to do with Mohammed.\n\n\u201cNo. Never. No,\u201d Obili said, making a tsk-tsk sound with his teeth when asked whether Mohammed could have ordered the killing. \u201cWe are a smart nation, and we know the outside world,\u201d Obili said. \u201cWhat happened to Khashoggi is terrible and goes against Islam. Our crown prince did not do that. We trust him, and we feel the changes he has made for us.\u201d\n\nAll around him, men in white robes and red-and-white head coverings picked out fresh tomatoes, peppers, dates, melons and squash to take home for lunch. By tradition and culture, virtually no women could be seen in the market.\n\nAbdullah, who declined to give his family name, sat on a red carpet laid on the asphalt of the marketplace, between a Ford SUV and a banged-up Toyota. Before him was a pile of agarwood chips, plus two roller suitcases and two briefcases also filled with the wood, which is burned as incense as a traditional form of welcome.\n\n\u201cThe crown prince is making everything better; I am in favor of everything he does,\u201d Abdullah said, weighing some of the expensive wood chips and slipping them into a paper bag for a customer. Referring to comments Mohammed made at a major Riyadh investment conference last month, Abdullah said, \u201cYesterday, he said we are going to be another Europe, and that\u2019s something we all support.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia and the United States have been allies since [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe and Americans are the same. We are both against terrorism. We are peaceful people.\u201d\n\nAsked about Khashoggi, Abdullah said: \u201cWe support our flag, our king, our crown prince and our country.\u201d\n\nAs the market wound down and the men walked away with their plastic bags of produce, Mohsin Mohammed al-Mohsin, 26, sat in his Toyota pickup next to the market entrance.\n\n\u201cKhashoggi was killed by mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the media. The media always lies.\u201d\n\nMany Saudis suspect that Saudi Arabia\u2019s rivals \u2014 Iran, Turkey or especially Qatar \u2014 were in some way involved in Khashoggi\u2019s death, even though Saudi authorities now say the killing was planned and carried out by Saudis.\n\nMohsin, who graduated from university in Riyadh and is looking for a job as a religion teacher in the public schools, said the Khashoggi killing \u201cconcerns\u201d him because it violates Islamic teachings.\n\nBut, like many interviewed in recent days, he said that even if it were proved that Mohammed ordered Khashoggi\u2019s death, this would not change his support for the crown prince.\n\n\u201cPeople should not disagree with their leaders, no matter what,\u201d he said, rubbing red prayer beads in his right hand. \u201cThere is an Islamic saying: \u2018To be patient and live with an unjust leader for 50 years is better than to live without a leader for one day.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nDespite Khashoggi case, U.S. firms and Saudi prince show up at \u2018Davos in the Desert\u2019\n\nKhashoggi death throws new light on Saudi prince\u2019s crackdown on dissent\n\nAmid Khashoggi uproar, many Saudis see a foreign plot and rally around their prince\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "", "", "", "\u201cI looked into Scott\u2019s stance on preexisting conditions.

It\u2019s certainly an interesting turnaround.\n\nScott is not in the House or Senate, so we included his quote because of its \u201chuh\u201d factor. We will now turn our attention to Taylor and McSally, and their claims about having fought insurance companies.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe statement in Taylor\u2019s ad is cleverly divided into two parts. He says he \u201cstood up to insurance companies\u201d and voted to \u201cprotect people with preexisting conditions.\u201d It does not quite have the direct link in the other two ads.\n\nBut it\u2019s still fishy. The Taylor campaign cited a 2017 vote in favor of ending health insurance company anti-trust exemptions in the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945. In the House, this was not a controversial bill, as it has the support of dentists, surgeons and other physicians who want more clout to negotiate contracts with insurance companies. Insurers would be prohibited from engaging in price-fixing, bid-rigging and market allocation in an aim to increase competition and lower premiums. It passed 416-7, but the Senate.has taken no action.\n\nThe campaign also points to Taylor\u2019s co-sponsorship of a bill called the Transparent Health Care Pricing Act of 2018. No action has been taken on it. In addition, the campaign points to two relatively minor bills on drug pricing that became law. Both originated in the Senate and were passed by a voice vote in the House.\n\nNone of these actions really counts as standing up to insurance companies. As for voting to protect people with preexisting conditions, that refers to Taylor\u2019s vote for the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act (AHCA), which narrowly passed the House, 217-214, but failed to proceed in the Senate.\n\nTwenty Republicans voted against the AHCA, in part because of their uneasiness with the changes proposed for the provisions regarding preexisting conditions. That unease was confirmed when the Congressional Budget Office issued a critical report three weeks after the vote. (We have written at length about this before.) The CBO was skeptical that the AHCA would work without harming people with preexisting conditions, in part because of inadequate funding.\n\nSo while there was language in the bill saying nothing in it would \u201climit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions,\u201d that still did not protect people from price increases. The CBO said that in some states, insurance might simply become unaffordable for people with certain diseases.\n\nRegarding the McSally ad, it says she was leading the fight \u2013 for something people already had under the ACA. Her campaign did not respond to a request for an explanation but told our colleagues at PolitiFact that she \u201csuccessfully negotiated $8 billion in additional funding to bring down insurance costs for people with preexisting conditions.\u201d The amendment helped swing some votes that assured passage, but remember how the CBO said the bill did not have enough funding? That was specifically referencing that $8 billion.\n\nWhile the CBO expects \u201cthat federal funding would have the intended effect of lowering premiums and out-of-pocket payments to some extent, its effect on community-rated premiums would be small because the funding would not be sufficient to substantially reduce the large increases in premiums for high-cost enrollees,\u201d the report said. \u201cTo evaluate the potential effect of the $8 billion fund, looking back at the high-risk pool program funded by the ACA prior to 2014 is useful. Within two years, the combined enrollment of about 100,000 enrollees in that program resulted in federal spending of close to $2.5 billion.\u201d The CBO then referenced a report that said \u201cthese high-risk pools likely covered just a fraction of the number of people with preexisting conditions who lacked insurance.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the $8 billion was woefully inadequate. During the debate over the Senate version of repeal, which did not pass, Trump said the House version was \u201cmean\u201d because it did not go far enough to protect individuals in the insurance markets. He urged the Senate to add more funds to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nMcSally also voted for the GOP\u2019s AHCA. Moreover, earlier in her tenure as a member of Congress, she voted to repeal Obama\u2019s ACA without a replacement in effect.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nUnder fire from their Democratic rivals for their votes on health care, McSally and Taylor are misleading voters. The protections for people with preexisting conditions are already pretty strong in the ACA. Both lawmakers cast votes that the CBO said weakened protections against price increases, especially in states that took advantage of waivers in the law. The money contained in the bill to mitigate those problems was inadequate, the CBO concluded.\n\nThe irony is rich: After years of trashing Obamacare, these Republicans are now saying they will do what he promised he would if elected president.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nShare the Facts 2018-11-01 11:16:46 UTC Washington Post 2 1 5 Washington Post Rating: Three Pinocchios Washington Post Rating: \u201c\u201cI looked into Scott\u2019s stance on preexisting conditions.

(Jim Mone/Associated Press)\n\nSince winning the NBA\u2019s MVP award in 2011, Derrick Rose\u2019s story has been mostly about his dispiriting descent into an afterthought, as severe injuries robbed him of his explosiveness and he began a journeyman\u2019s shuffle from team to team. Wednesday night found the 10th-year guard breaking down in tears \u2014 but only after submitting one of the season\u2019s most stunning performances, a 50-point explosion to lead his Timberwolves past the Jazz.\n\n[Box score: Timberwolves 128, Jazz 125]\n\nAfter burying his head in a towel to gather himself, Rose was asked what reaching that point total, a career high, meant to him. \u201cEverything, man,\u201d he replied, \u201cI worked my a-- off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did this for the franchise, the organization, the fans, everybody,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything just to win, and tonight was a hell of a night.\u201d\n\nCareer-high 50 PTS | Game-winning block\n\n\n\nAn emotional Derrick Rose talks over his memorable night for the @Timberwolves!#AllEyesNorth #ThisIsWhyWePlay pic.twitter.com/YK28ptXyoG \u2014 NBA (@NBA) November 1, 2018\n\nIn addition to hitting 19 of 31 shots to reach his 50 points, Rose had six assists, four rebounds and a crucial block on the Jazz\u2019s attempt at a game-tying three-pointer in the closing seconds. Following Minnesota\u2019s 128-125 triumph, Rose was mobbed by teammates as warm salutes poured forth online from other players around the league.\n\n\u201cEvery Basketball fan in the world should feel good for DRose,\u201d the Heat\u2019s Dwyane Wade said on Twitter. \u201cTonite [sic] was an example of never giving up on yourself and when others believe in you. Amazing things can happen. I\u2019m smiling like I scored 50! Congrats to a good dude!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you bro! No one knows you\u2019re [sic] struggle what you went through day in an[d] day out!\u201d the Cavaliers' J.R. Smith tweeted. \u201cYou are truly inspiration to everyone! Super proud to have had you as a teammate!\u201d\n\nThis is what makes sports GREAT. The genuine \u2764\ufe0f and appreciation Derrick Rose teammates have for him is fantastic.

He and Timberwolves Coach Tom Thibodeau insisted that his absence was strictly related to getting some routine rest, but a report earlier in the day claimed that Butler was intent on ratcheting up pressure on the front office to deal him as soon as possible.\n\nButler\u2019s unhappiness at still being on the team, and his willingness to express it in a variety of ways, has cast a pall over a squad he helped make the playoffs last season for the first time in 14 years. That could well have contributed, in turn, to the obvious joy Rose\u2019s teammates took in his performance Wednesday.\n\n\"D-Rose is the man,\u201d Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns said after the game (via the Minneapolis Star-Tribune). \u201cThe legend. Myth. Vintage. It was numbing. I never realized something like that in my life. The man was just out there floating. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t do no wrong.\u201d\n\nJeff Teague shared the moment Derrick Rose came back to the locker room after posting 50.\n\n\n\n[\ud83d\udcf9:IG/JeffTeague] pic.twitter.com/aJxcO2BjnF \u2014 Dime (@DimeUPROXX) November 1, 2018\n\nGiven that Minnesota\u2019s starting point guard, Jeff Teague, also missed the game with an injury, a major contribution from Rose was needed. Nothing close to what he provided, though, could have been reasonably expected, given that he had scored a total of 100 points over the team\u2019s first seven games.\n\nRose\u2019s scoring average of 14.3 points coming into the game was actually a major improvement over the mark of 8.4 he posted last season, which he began with the Cavaliers following one season with the Knicks. After a 16-game stint for Cleveland, which included a two-week leave of absence he said was related to his frustration over a lingering ankle injury, he was traded to the Jazz as essentially a throw-in to help make a three-team deal work.\n\nThe Timberwolves picked him up a month later for the rest of that season, which many viewed at the time as a gesture of irrational loyalty by Thibodeau, who had coached Rose during his glory years with the Bulls. However, Rose played well during Minnesota\u2019s first-round playoff series against the Rockets, coming off the bench to average 14.2 points and 2.6 assists and setting the stage for more solid play this season.\n\n\u201cComing here, I don\u2019t have to look back, dude,\u201d Rose recently told The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania. \u201cTo adapt to this league now, you got to be able to shoot, period. I feel my game is more controlled and I have better pace to my game. I\u2019m not out of control and reckless. I\u2019ve matured as a player, but it\u2019s going to take the public seeing me more and seeing the team win more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel healthy and I want to look healthy,\u201d he added. \u201cRight now, just like in anything in life, you miss something for a long time and you get something taken away from you, it\u2019s going to take some time to get a rhythm back.\"\n\nLakers\u2019 LeBron James said Timberwolves\u2019 Derrick Rose \u201cshowed he\u2019s still a superhero\u201d w/ career-high 50 points.

It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shared this with him last year,\u201d Thibodeau said of the guard whose career he first helped flourish, then resuscitate. \u201cIn every story there\u2019s a beginning, a middle and an end.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nOn Wednesday, nearly a month after journalist Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and vanished, Turkish authorities made their strongest statement yet about what happened to the dissident writer.\n\nKhashoggi was \u201cstrangled as soon as he entered the consulate,\" said Irfan Fidan, Istanbul\u2019s chief prosecutor, calling the act part of a Saudi team\u2019s \u201cpremeditated plans.\u201d Khashoggi\u2019s body, \u201cafter being strangled, was subsequently destroyed by being dismembered, once again confirming the planning of the murder,\u201d Fidan added.\n\nThis conclusive declaration followed the departure from Istanbul of Saudi prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb, who had been dispatched to investigate Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. Despite the kingdom\u2019s vows of transparency and cooperation, Mojeb, according to my colleagues, neither gave the location of Khashoggi\u2019s body to his Turkish counterparts nor identified the supposed \u201clocal collaborator\u201d who helped dispose of his remains. Turkish investigators are reportedly pursuing a theory that Khashoggi\u2019s body was dissolved in acid.\n\nA senior Turkish official told my colleagues that \u201cSaudi officials seemed primarily interested in finding out what evidence the Turkish authorities had against the perpetrators\u201d of Khashoggi\u2019s killing and that Turkish officials doubted Riyadh was \u201ckeen on genuinely cooperating.\u201d\n\nFor weeks, Riyadh has engaged in a series of obfuscations, denials and delays as international anger mounted over Khashoggi\u2019s apparent death. Eventually, the Saudi government acknowledged that Khashoggi had died in its custody. It blamed his killing on supposed rogue elements involved in a botched Saudi operation to detain Khashoggi and said they would be tried in Saudi courts. But Riyadh has yet to formally acknowledge the conclusions of the Turkish investigation \u2014 or publicly disclose its own.\n\nAs readers of Today\u2019s WorldView know, the Khashoggi scandal has badly damaged the reputation of Saudi Arabia and its ambitious crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, a repeated target of criticism in Khashoggi\u2019s columns for The Washington Post. President Trump has been a conspicuous cheerleader of MBS \u2014 as the 33-year-old royal is often referred to \u2014 but even he eventually spoke out against Riyadh\u2019s handling of the matter.\n\n\u201cObviously there\u2019s been deception and there\u2019s been lies,\u201d Trump told The Washington Post last month when pressed on Saudi Arabia\u2019s shifting explanations. \u201cTheir stories are all over the place.\u201d He nevertheless chose to defend MBS, who has reportedly struck up a close personal rapport with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and has been a vociferous supporter of Trump\u2019s efforts to confront Iran.\n\nTrump also pointed to tens of billions of dollars in Saudi arms purchases from U.S. companies as a reason to not disrupt ties with Riyadh. \u201cHe\u2019s seen as a person who can keep things under check,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean that in a positive way.\u201d He added that MBS is \u201cconsidered by far the strongest person\u201d and that \u201che truly loves his country.\u201d\n\nBut while the White House may be keen to back its man in Riyadh, the rest of Washington is less enthusiastic. A number of prominent lobbying firms dropped their Saudi contracts in reaction to Khashoggi\u2019s murder, and some foreign governments have trotted out tentative punishments. Politicians in Congress, including senators briefed by intelligence officials on the evidence collected by Turkish authorities, have loudly denounced Riyadh. On Wednesday, a group of Republican senators called on the White House to scrap talks over a U.S.-Saudi civilian nuclear deal.\n\nLindsey Graham: MBS is a \"wrecking ball\" who had Khashoggi murdered, he's \"toxic\" and he's \"gotta go.\"\n\n\n\n\"This guy is a wrecking ball, he had this guy murdered in a consulate in Turkey, and to expect me to ignore it, I feel used and abused.\" (via Fox) pic.twitter.com/aUnZQzsdb8 \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) October 16, 2018\n\nOther lawmakers in Washington have trained their ire specifically on MBS, whose take-lots-of-prisoners rule is a departure from traditional Saudi caution.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s allies and clients realize the danger of crossing Prince Mohammed, who has shown the world that he can be reckless and ruthless,\u201d wrote Mohamad Bazzi, an associate professor at New York University. \u201cThose who stay in the prince\u2019s good graces hope that he will reward fealty, especially since he has positioned himself to rule for decades as Saudi Arabia\u2019s next king.\u201d\n\nYet the crisis over Khashoggi has called MBS\u2019s own position into question. As my colleagues reported in a lengthy expos\u00e9, the crown prince reached his place of power within the court by ruthlessly sidelining, arresting or otherwise subduing rivals within the royal family, including some princes well known in Washington circles. The pressure is now on his father, the aging King Salman, to rein in his son.\n\n\u201cThe question now is whether King Salman will decide there is wisdom in curtailing Mohammed\u2019s powers, or at least in appearing to do so,\" my colleagues wrote.\n\nReports of the return of one of the king\u2019s younger brothers, who had been living abroad out of fear of arrest, deepened speculation over the maneuvering taking place within the palace. One hypothetical scenario would see MBS compelled to share power with a more senior relative, who would work to restore international confidence in the kingdom.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be Americans, presumably even in the Trump administration, who are going to be telling the Saudis you\u2019ve got to put some guardrails around this guy, and the most public way you can do that is by having a senior member of the family [become] foreign minister,\u201d Gregory Gause, an expert on the kingdom at Texas A&M University, said to HuffPost.\n\nIndeed, the administration \u2014 which seemingly gave MBS carte blanche to wage a ruinous war in Yemen, trigger a regional crisis by blockading Qatar and allegedly detain the Lebanese prime minister \u2014 may be reaching its limits. This week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for hostilities in Yemen to end within 30 days. When Saudi Arabia was faced with international criticism over Yemen in the past, the Trump administration frequently rushed to Riyadh\u2019s defense \u2014 even after evidence showed that a Saudi missile strike had killed dozens of Yemeni schoolchildren. But after Khashoggi\u2019s murder, the mood is changing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thrown open the doors of doubt to the entire Saudi version of the war in Yemen,\u201d Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen scholar at Oxford University, said to The Post\u2019s Sudarsan Raghavan. \u201cIt is no longer able to just tell the world what it wants it to think without the world now being suspicious and skeptical.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

(Netflix) (Adam Rose/Netflix)\n\nUsually, when an anticipated restaurant faces permitting delays, the chef goes into panic mode \u2014 quick.\n\nNot for Reverie\u2019s executive chef Johnny Spero, who last fall sneaked away from D.C. while his Georgetown restaurant faced permitting and design delays to do battle in a global cooking competition called \u201cThe Final Table.\u201d It\u2019s coming to Netflix on Nov. 20 (see the trailer here).\n\n\u201cSomehow I timed this all perfectly,\u201d Spero said, jokingly referring to the delays, and the fact that the show will air just 45 days after Reverie\u2019s opening.\n\n\u201cThinking about it now, [the show] seemed like such a long time ago. It was a blur,\u201d he said.\n\nJust like most made-for-television cooking competitions, \u201cThe Final Table\u201d is predicated on high-stakes, time-limited food challenges. But what sets this show apart is its global appeal and talent. Contestants come from around the world: Shane Osborn (Arcane: Hong Kong), Aaron Bludorn (Cafe Boulud: New York), Manuel Berganza (Tapas Club: Singapore), Monique Fiso (Hiakai: Porirua, New Zealand) and Charles Michel (a roving \u201cculinary artist\u201d), to name a few.\n\n\u201cI really wanted people competing who weren\u2019t TV chefs,\u201d says Yasmin Shackleton, the show\u2019s co-creator and executive producer, who previously worked on Fox\u2019s \u201cMasterChef.\u201d \u201cThese are people who you haven\u2019t seen on TV and who genuinely work in their kitchen week in and week out.\u201d\n\nThe international casting is also part of Netflix\u2019s strategy to lure in food-obsessed viewers and appeal to a growing segment of international subscribers. A few other things that set this show apart: There\u2019s no behind-the-scenes drama, no screaming or throwing pans in a fit of rage, and no cars or cash prizes.\n\n\u201cOur show is all about the celebration of food,\u201d Shackleton said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really care what the chefs think about each other. It\u2019s basically let the best man or woman win. They\u2019re all competing to show off their best selves and win a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nThe seat she\u2019s referring to will be awarded to a winner on the tenth (and final) episode. That person will have earned the right to join a table of nine judges of internationally recognized names: Enrique Olvera (Mexico), Andoni Aduriz (Spain), Clare Smyth (United Kingdom), Helena Rizzo (Brazil), Vineet Bhatia (India), Grant Achatz (U.S.), Carlo Cracco (Italy), Yoshihiro Narisawa (Japan) and Anne-Sophie Pic (France).\n\nBut first, there are nine episodes and culinary challenges to overcome, each with a different food challenge tied to a specific country and dish.\n\nThe two-dozen chef contestants work in teams of two. Spero cooked alongside teammate, Jessica Lorigo, who is head chef at Topa Sukalderia in San Sebastian, Spain.\n\n\u201cYou stick with your teammate almost the whole way through,\u201d Shackleton said. \u201cThen if you take your partner to the finale, it\u2019s head-to-head.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a surprise twist that reveals itself in the final episode. The last two teams split, and the chefs compete individually in a challenge judged by the nine star chefs, who pick one winner. Instead of a prize, the winning chef gets the prestige of having a seat at the final table.\n\nLorigo has a D.C. connection. She worked with Spero at R.J. Cooper\u2019s Rogue 24 in Shaw before moving to Spain and eventually luring Spero there to work at Aduriz\u2019s Mugaritz in 2015. For Spero, the decision for a teammate was easy.\n\n\u201cThe show asked: If you had your dream partnership, who would it be? The answer was Jess,\u201d Spero said. \u201cShe just gets me, and we work on the same wavelength as far as communicating and talking through our ideas.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing because the food challenges were fast and varied. In the Mexico episode, the challenge \u2014 to build the perfect taco \u2014 was judged by two celebrity judges: Mexican boxer Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and actress Martha Higareda. In the Italy episode, soccer star Alessandro Del Piero and Italian food journalist Eleonora Cozzella did the judging.\n\nThe celebrity judges decide which three teams are up for elimination. Then those teams compete in a \u201cfinal plate challenge\u201d judged by a country\u2019s food critic and star chef \u2014 for Mexico, it was food critic Mariana Camacho and chef Enrique Olvera.\n\nSurprisingly, the Spain episode proved challenging for Spero. \u201cI love Spain, but I\u2019m not a classically trained Spanish chef,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we saw the most pressure put on us there because everyone assumed we were the experts.\u201d\n\nWhile Spero will not say how far he advances, or whether he lands the coveted seat at the final table, he did reveal one perk to the show \u2014 meeting comedian Dax Shepard and \u201cFargo\u201d star Colin Hanks, who served as celebrity judges for the U.S. episode.\n\n\u201cIt was interesting to meet them, and really they\u2019re just people, too,\u201d Spero said. \u201cI treated them like I would any other guest at my restaurant.\u201d", "A new report by a U.S. government watchdog paints a discouraging portrait of Afghanistan in recent months, detailing continued Taliban gains, record civilian casualties by pro-government airstrikes and insurgent attacks, a disappointing performance by U.S.-funded \u00adanti-corruption agencies and soaring drug production and addiction.\n\nIn a tense political season, when hopes for change have inspired millions of Afghans to vote for a new parliament and hopes for peace have spurred new efforts at dialogue with Taliban insurgents, the report released Thursday by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) casts a sobering eye on persistent setbacks in the fight against the Taliban and cumulative failures in the wars on corruption and drugs.\n\nThe report stressed that Taliban control and influence continued to expand nationwide in recent months, while Afghan government control or influence over national territory has \u201creached the lowest level\u201d since late 2015, declining slightly to 55 percent of 407 districts. It said government forces \u201cmade minimal or no progress in pressuring the Taliban\u201d in the past three months and \u201cfailed to gain greater control or influence over districts, population and territory.\u201d\n\nThe report also highlighted the sustained high rate of war-related deaths and injuries among both civilians and security forces: a record 2,798 civilians were killed and 5,252 injured between May and September. It also said the average monthly number of casualties among Afghan military and police forces, while not officially released, was \u201cthe greatest it has ever been\u201d in similar periods during the conflict, probably between 30 to 40 killed per day.\n\nThe report found that during the first nine months of 2018, suicide attacks by insurgents increased dramatically, rising by 38 percent over the same period last year. Casualties caused by airstrikes by Afghan and coalition forces also climbed sharply, increasing by 46 percent to 313 deaths and 336 injuries, the report said. It noted that U.S. and coalition officials have disputed the latter set of figures, reporting that far fewer civilians were killed or injured.\n\nThe SIGAR report also described a number of \u201cdiscouraging developments\u201d in the past several months, including a four-day Taliban siege of Ghazni city in August and the insurgents\u2019 rejection of a second truce offered by President Ashraf Ghani the same month. Also on that list was an Oct. 18 shooting attack in Kandahar at a meeting of U.S. and regional officials that killed the regional police and intelligence chiefs. The top U.S. military commander in the country, Gen. Austin \u201cScott\u201d Miller, was unharmed in the attack, for which the Taliban claimed responsibility.\n\nIn an especially critical look at U.S.-funded efforts to combat narcotics, the report described a rapidly escalating problem of opium production and drug addiction that has defied years of expensive programs and investment.\n\n\u201cThese efforts have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $8 billion since 2002, yet Afghanistan\u2019s opium crisis is worse than ever,\u201d John F. Sopko, the special inspector general, wrote in an introduction to the 250-page document.\n\nThe report said that Afghan opium poppy cultivation has reached an \u201cunprecedented high\u201d of about 820,000 acres, and that opium accounts for 19 to 32 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and provides half a million jobs, representing \u201ca backbone\u201d of the Afghan economy.\n\nIt also noted that addiction to opioids among Afghans has skyrocketed, reaching several million people. Overall, it said, the drug trade has become \u201can existential threat to the Afghan state\u201d by fueling corruption and crime and by financially benefiting the insurgency.\n\nDespite these alarming developments and the large sums spent by U.S. agencies to combat drugs in Afghanistan since 2002, the report found that U.S. officials have played down the narcotics problem in recent years and no longer see it as a \u201cmission objective or a priority.\u201d The inspector general called for a \u201cdeep review\u201d of U.S. anti-drug policies and efforts in the country.\n\nA more surprising aspect of the SIGAR report was its sharp criticism of the Afghan attorney general\u2019s office and its highly touted foreign-funded initiatives to combat corruption and crime in Afghan civilian government and military sectors. The report blasted the attorney general, a respected former human rights advocate, saying he has a \u201cpoor record of prosecuting powerful and influential corrupt actors\u201d and has failed to cooperate with U.S. officials.\n\nThe report cited criticism by the U.S. Justice Department that the Afghan attorney general\u2019s office is \u201cunproductive, corrupt and patronage-laden.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nIn Afghanistan\u2019s Kandahar province, parliamentary vote delayed but peaceful\n\nU.S. military scales back contact with Afghans after \u2018insider\u2019 shootings\n\nThe Taliban has vowed to disrupt Afghan elections.

We would be closer to my parents and in a (hopefully) better job market.\n\nWe are both torn by the decision. My siblings and friends no longer live in that city so we would be starting over in many ways. There will always be reasons to stay here and always reasons to leave.\n\nAny advice on how to make the decision and when to know it is right? Sometimes I feel if we don't move now we never will, even though I know that's not necessarily true, but each year we are more ingrained in our lives here. I have applied your advice about making the decision and living with that for a while to see how it feels, but I still feel so torn.\n\n\u2014 Moving Cities\n\nMoving Cities: So, by my count, the only reason to move is the possibly better job market? You\u2019d gain proximity to your parents, yes, but lose proximity to his people, so there\u2019s no net gain for you as a couple as far as family.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nIs the chance of a better job worth all this angst?\n\nOr is this really about your preference for your family over his? And if so, is he okay with that?\n\nMaybe you\u2019re clear about what you ultimately want, but your letter isn\u2019t. And if the letter is a reflection of your state of mind, then it makes perfect sense that you don\u2019t know where to live.\n\nSo, stay right where you are and go back a few steps in your thinking. Not this place vs. that place, but what do I actually want? Suggest the same exercise to your husband.\n\nYou have to know your priorities to know how best to serve them.\n\nBuilt into the process of setting priorities is acceptance that you won\u2019t get everything; you can\u2019t be near both your family and his, so which do you prefer? You can\u2019t both maximize your career potential and remain near your established friends, so which matters more to you?\n\nPlus, any decision needs to include as broad a vision as possible, to minimize unintended consequences. A job-market upgrade can mean a higher cost of living; family proximity changes the calculus of major illness; culture and climate can dictate how you feel, whom you meet and where you spend your time \u2014 doing what. \u201cHome\u201d is a simple feeling that comprises more variables than we know.\n\nIf you cite the job market because you\u2019re struggling financially, to the point it\u2019s wearing on you, then skip the introspection and just apply for jobs in your parents\u2019 city. Give yourselves an actual point of comparison.\n\nAnd, don\u2019t be so quick to backpedal on this: \u201cSometimes I feel if we don\u2019t move now we never will.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of truth to it.

(Ahmad Al-Basha/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration has launched its most concerted effort yet to pressure Saudi Arabia to end the conflict in Yemen amid growing opposition in Congress to U.S. military support for the kingdom\u2019s war there.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in recent days have said the time has come to halt more than three years of conflict between Houthi rebels and a government recognized by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the West. U.N. officials have warned that the war has left half the population of Yemen, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, on the precipice of famine.\n\nBut the proposals put forth by Pompeo and Mattis are burdened by strategic limitations.\n\nMattis called for a cease-fire in which the rebels would pull back from Yemen\u2019s border with Saudi Arabia and start negotiations within 30 days. But he also said Saudi Arabia had a right to defend itself against Houthi missiles, which U.S. officials say have been supplied by Iran.\n\nPompeo proposed that the rebels first stop firing missiles at Saudi Arabia and the UAE and that Saudi Arabia then stop airstrikes that have killed thousands of civilians.\n\n\u201cIt is time to end this conflict, replace conflict with compromise, and allow the Yemeni people to heal through peace and reconstruction,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nThe urgency of that appeal reflects the complexity of U.S. interests on the Arabian Peninsula, weeks after Pompeo certified to Congress that Saudi Arabia and the UAE were making progress on reducing civilian casualties in Yemen. The report was required because the United States helps the Saudi-led coalition refuel its jets and shares intelligence with its military officials.\n\nBut neither U.S. official\u2019s statements had an \u201cor else\u201d attached to it, former officials said.\n\n\u201cIf you give your closest ally a pass and say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to do anything until the enemy takes the first step,\u2019 that is not a serious proposal,\u201d said Stephen Seche, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen who now is executive vice president of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to propose both parties need to move simultaneously to implement a cease-fire.\u201d\n\nIt also was unclear who might lean on the Houthis and Iran, especially as Tehran faces the reimposition of U.S. sanctions next week after President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t happen by spontaneous combustion,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East scholar at the Wilson Center, calling the administration\u2019s initiative intriguing but \u201chalf-baked.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, next week, oil sanctions kick in,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd Tehran will want something in return for leveraging their Houthi ally.\u201d\n\nBut humanitarian organizations expressed relief, sensing a glimmer of hope that the fighting that has killed more than 10,000 civilians may have a potential end in sight.\n\nEven as the Trump administration intensifies pressure to end the war, the Saudi-led coalition has sent thousands of additional troops to the front lines near the strategic port city of Hodeida. That raises the possibility of a punishing urban battle that could add to civilian suffering.\n\nThe coalition has made capturing the city from the Houthis a priority, in part because it says the rebels have used the port to smuggle in Iranian-supplied weaponry.\n\nMattis has mentioned the war several times in recent days and highlighted the human suffering in a weekend speech in Bahrain.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to move forward on stopping this war,\u201d he said last weekend, while also lauding Saudi efforts to ensure an accurate air operation and citing the difficulty of avoiding unintended deaths when targeting militants from afar.\n\n[Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in Yemen war comes under new scrutiny after Khashoggi killing]\n\nOn Tuesday, speaking at the U.S. Institute of Peace, Mattis said with a note of urgency: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move towards a peace effort here, and we can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to do it sometime in the future. We\u2019ve admired this problem for long enough down there.\u201d\n\nPompeo weighed in Tuesday night, expressing support for U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths, who has called for negotiations to convene in November.\n\n\u201cThe time is now for the cessation of hostilities, including missile and [drone] strikes from Houthi-controlled areas into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cSubsequently, Coalition airstrikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen.\u201d\n\nThe officials\u2019 remarks were stronger than anything the administration has said about Yemen in the past 17 months.\n\nPompeo came under criticism last month when he backed continuing arms sales to the Saudis, reportedly after concerns were raised that a cutoff could affect billions of dollars in such sales to the kingdom.\n\nSince then, events have converged to push the Trump administration to alter its public stance on Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\n\nThe administration appears to be trying to get in front of proposals in Congress to curtail U.S. support, with critics emboldened by the international outrage over the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi by a team of Saudi agents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to think there is some kind of association here,\u201d said Seche, the former U.S. ambassador. \u201cSomething other than just a sudden desire to see war end. A wave of indignation that has swept over Saudi Arabia because of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi has got to have some impact on our thinking, given our close association with the Saudis in Yemen as the preferred supplier of weapons and logistical support. It implicates the United States in this humanitarian crisis. It\u2019s time to get ahead of the wave.\u201d\n\nThe administration statements come as both parties in Congress press for an end to U.S. involvement in the conflict.\n\nAmong those from the president\u2019s party who have questioned the current policy are Sens. Todd C. Young (Ind.) and Rand Paul (Ky.), and more recently Sens. Ben Sasse (Neb.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.).\n\nIn the House, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) has introduced a measure, now supported by senior Democrats, that would halt U.S. involvement in the conflict under the War Powers Act.\n\nGerald Feierstein, another former ambassador to Yemen, said the changing analysis in Congress could transform U.S.-Saudi ties, particularly when it comes to arms sales.\n\n\u201cPeople are really questioning the whole nature of the relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia is one of the world\u2019s largest purchasers of advanced weaponry and an important customer for U.S. defense firms.\n\nFeierstein said the administration may have another motive to want a swift end to the hostilities: It would alleviate pressure on the administration to take broader punitive action against Saudi Arabia in the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s death. If American-made Saudi weapons are not being used in Yemen, it will be easier for U.S. arms sales to the kingdom to continue.\n\nRobert Malley, who was a senior White House official under President Barack Obama and now serves as president of the International Crisis Group, said the Trump administration had closely embraced the Persian Gulf kingdom, smoothing over differences from the previous administration and elevating its position as a central Middle Eastern ally.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been missing is getting something out of that hug,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could reestablish some balance.\u201d\n\nMichael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he worries that a push for a cease-fire to alleviate political pressure could paper over the fissures driving the war. But he said a cease-fire and negotiations now have a decent chance to succeed.\n\n\u201cBecause international support for this war is about as low as you can get,\u201d he said, \u201cthe United States is under severe pressure from its own congressional branch, and military progress in the war is limited. The U.N. envoy is very active and quite effective.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd exhaustion may be a factor,\u201d he added. \u201cThat improves the chances of a settlement.\u201d\n\nSudarsan Raghavan in Cairo contributed to this report.", "\n\nJimmy Butler demanded in September that the Timberwolves trade him to another team. (Jim Mone/Associated Press)\n\nJimmy Butler pushed back against a report Wednesday that his nonparticipation that evening in a game vs. the Utah Jazz was related to his desire to be traded and could, in fact, \u201clead to [an] extended absence\u201d by the Timberwolves\u2019 disgruntled star. Butler echoed Minnesota\u2019s claim that he was merely getting some rest, and he indicated that he would suit up for his team\u2019s next game.\n\n\u201cBecause my body is hurting and I don\u2019t want to go out there and risk an injury, people make stuff up?\u201d Butler said in a text to ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols. He referred to a scheduled game against the Warriors in adding, \u201cWhat are they going to do when I show up and hoop on Friday?\u201d\n\nButler was reacting to a tweet posted earlier in the day by the Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, who cited league sources in claiming that sitting out Wednesday\u2019s game constituted the \u201cnext step in six-week-long process aimed at getting the all-star out of Minnesota\u201d and \u201ccould lead to [an] extended absence for Butler.\u201d\n\nButler made his trade demand in September, before the season began, but the Timberwolves have yet to accede to it amid reports that they are asking for a far higher price than other teams are willing to meet. Team owner Glen Taylor reportedly has pledged to Butler to work toward making a trade happen, but as the season moves toward its second month, the eighth-year veteran may be intent on ratcheting up the pressure.\n\n\u201cHe missed all of training camp, basically, so he has general soreness,\u201d Tom Thibodeau, the Timberwolves coach and president of basketball operations, said of Butler missing Wednesday\u2019s game, according to the Athletic. However, the website noted that the contest was sandwiched between off days Tuesday and Thursday, which potentially could have allowed Butler to get adequate rest, and it claimed that \u201chis availability will be determined on a game-by-game basis.\u201d\n\nThere was noteworthy disagreement between Charania and another prominent NBA reporter, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, over the decision for Butler to miss the Jazz game. Whereas Charania reported that Butler made that call himself, Wojnarowski cited sources in claiming that the Timberwolves \u201csuggested\u201d the player sit out the contest.\n\nWojnarowski reported last week that the Rockets offered a package including four first-round picks for Butler, hoping to add another difference-maker to its all-star guard tandem of James Harden and Chris Paul, after Houston has gotten off to a surprisingly dismal start. The Athletic, though, reported Wednesday that the Timberwolves have been \u201creluctant to accept that deal\u201d because they are leery of also getting veteran guard Brandon Knight, who would be included to help balance the salaries involved.\n\nIn Butler\u2019s absence, Timberwolves guard Derrick Rose, a former teammate on the Bulls, scored 50 points as Minnesota topped Utah, 128-125.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nWizards finish season\u2019s longest road trip battered, broken and out of answers\n\nThe Russell Westbrook-Patrick Beverley feud is on again, this time with police presence\n\nDJ Durkin, Maryland part ways following outcry over coach\u2019s reinstatement\n\nWillie McCovey, Hall of Famer for the San Francisco Giants, dies at 80", "", "", "", "North Korean officials commit sexual violence against women with apparent impunity as part of systemic oppression and other abuses tolerated within Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Wednesday.\n\nThe 86-page report offers the latest glimpse into a range of suspected human rights violations carried out by authorities in the North Korean state, including public executions and arbitrary detentions of suspected activists and dissidents.\n\nThe findings come amid a flurry of diplomacy on North Korea led by the United States and South Korea.

I stood still quietly, acting like I didn\u2019t notice, hoping it wouldn\u2019t be me the one to have to follow the guard.\u201d\n\nOne defector not cited in the report, Seo Hyang-ran, said she was stripped and vaginally searched by secret-police officials after being returned from China in a failed attempt to seek haven in the region.\n\nShe told The Washington Post she was \u201cpicked\u201d as a rape target by a guard at a detention facility in North Hamgyong.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t make sense of what happened to me, but it felt extremely humiliating,\u201d said Seo, who now works as a counselor for North Korean defectors at Chungnam National University Hospital in South Korea. \u201cNow I know that it wasn\u2019t my fault and I was unfairly subjected to sexual violence.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nOpinion: Trump era is full of cruelty without consequence\n\nSatellite images show North Korea\u2019s \u2018reeducation\u2019 camps\n\nKorean defectors wonder: Could they really go home again?\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "", "", "President Trump delivers remarks at a campaign rally at the Hertz Arena in Estero, Fla., on Oct. 31, 2018. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump introduced the polarizing issue of birthright citizenship as a central plank of his closing argument to voters here Wednesday night as he began his final campaign sprint to Election Day.\n\nTrump said illegal immigration was the driving issue of the midterm elections and vowed that with enlarged Republican congressional majorities he would achieve his immigration priorities, including eliminating the constitutional right to citizenship for those born in the United States to undocumented immigrant parents.\n\nThe president spoke at length about birthright citizenship, which he called \u201cthis crazy policy\u201d that he said allowed \u201chundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children\u201d born on U.S. soil to automatically become U.S. citizens and therefore eligible for every privilege and benefit of citizenship.\n\n\u201cBirthright citizenship \u2014 you know all about it \u2014 we will keep the criminals, the drug dealers, we will keep them all out of our country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will get rid of all of this. We will end, finally, birthright citizenship. It\u2019s costing us so many billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nTrump said this week that he was considering signing an executive order ending birthright citizenship, though he acknowledged earlier Wednesday that it was likely to result in a legal challenge that could go all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nMost legal scholars \u2014 as well as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u2014 have said the president does not have the power to eliminate the policy with the stroke of his pen because it is a constitutional right spelled out in the 14th Amendment.\n\nBut Trump argued otherwise during his rollicking campaign rally at a Florida sports arena.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution does not require it,\u201d the president said, because \u201cillegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe standing crowd of several thousand roared with approval.\n\nTrump has focused on the issue of immigration in the home stretch of the campaign as part of a strategy to stoke fear and galvanize his core supporters to turn out in support of Republican candidates for the Senate, House and governorships.\n\nAs he has for days now, here at his Wednesday rally, Trump warned of the caravan of Central American migrants making its way north toward the U.S.-Mexico border. Though the migrants are hundreds of miles from the border, Trump this week deployed 5,200 U.S. troops there and said he was planning to send more.\n\nTrump seemed to preview action at the border. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very interesting over the next week,\u201d he told the rally crowd, though the commander in chief did not offer any details of what he might have in store.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting prepared for the caravan, folks,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of rough people in those caravans. They are not angels. They are not.\u201d He called the migrants \u201cthe opposition,\u201d but added, \u201cWe\u2019re tougher than anybody.\u201d\n\nTrump then suggested that border agents might imprison migrants seeking asylum. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be released,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s called catch, but we take the word \u2018release\u2019 out. We\u2019re not going to be releasing them.\u201d The crowd cheered.\n\nThe president kicked off his sprint to Election Day with plans to hold at least 11 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.\n\nTrump won each of these states in 2016 and is trying to leverage his popularity in them to lift Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate and governorships to victory. He cast the election as a referendum on his presidency, saying, \u201cEverything we have achieved\u201d is at stake. He called this \u201cone of the most important elections of our entire lives \u2014 though I will say, not as important as 2016.\u201d\n\nTrump spotlighted Florida Republican candidates, including two who joined him on stage: Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for the Senate, and Rep. Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor. He also singled out two congressmen up for reelection, Reps. Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz, though he notably said nothing about their records on behalf of Floridians. Rather, he praised their defense of him on cable television.\n\n\u201cSo great to me on television,\u201d Trump said of Rooney. \u201cI love it when he defends me. He\u2019s brutal. He gets the job done.\u201d\n\nBoth Scott and DeSantis used their turn on Trump\u2019s stage \u2014 behind the presidential lectern, with thousands of his devoted supporters watching from around the arena \u2014 to bash their respective Democratic opponents, Sen. Bill Nelson and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.\n\nDeSantis called Gillum a \u201cfailed mayor\u201d and said Gillum was \u201crunning on impeaching the president.\u201d Then he brought up the federal public-corruption investigation of Tallahassee \u2014 Gillum has said he did nothing wrong \u2014 and said, \u201cMaybe we should impeach Gillum as mayor of Tallahassee!\u201d\n\nThat inspired the crowd to chant, \u201cLock him up!\u201d\n\nTrump opened his rally by condemning the massacre of 11 Jewish worshipers last Saturday at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, which the president visited Tuesday. The president denounced \u201cthe vile poison of anti-Semitism\u201d but almost immediately turned to attack the news media for its coverage of the community\u2019s peaceful protests of his visit. He accused the media of using the tragedy to sow anger.\n\n\u201cWe have forcefully condemned hatred, racism, bigotry and prejudice in all of its forms, but the media doesn\u2019t want you to hear your story,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my story; it\u2019s your story. And that\u2019s why 33 percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is in fact \u2014 and I hate to say this \u2014 in fact the enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nThe crowd chanted in response, \u201cCNN Sucks!\u201d One woman in the stands could be heard loudly screaming the name of Jim Acosta, the network\u2019s chief White House correspondent, who was covering the rally.\n\nEven as his fans shouted down journalists, chanted for a Democratic mayor to be jailed and cheered for the end of birthright citizenship, Trump tried to portray his movement \u2014 \u201cthe greatest movement in the history of our country,\u201d as he put it \u2014 as one of harmony and inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cOur movement is about love for fellow Americans,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur movement is where everyone belongs.\u201d", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]
